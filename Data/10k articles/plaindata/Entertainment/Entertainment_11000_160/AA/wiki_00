{"id": "12561015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12561015", "title": "4chan", "text": "4chan\n\n4chan is an English-language imageboard website. Users generally post anonymously, with the most recent posts appearing above the rest. 4chan is split into various boards with their own specific content and guidelines. Registration is not possible (except for staff).\n\nLaunched on October 1, 2003, the site was modeled on Japanese imageboards, particularly Futaba Channel. 4chan's first boards were originally primarily used for posting pictures and discussing manga and anime. The site quickly became popular, expanded, and now features boards dedicated to a wide variety of topics, from anime/manga to videogames, music, literature, fitness, politics, and sports.\n\nThe site has been linked to Internet subcultures and activism groups, most notably Anonymous, the alt-right and Project Chanology. 4chan users have been responsible for the formation or popularization of Internet memes such as lolcats, Rickrolling, \"Chocolate Rain\", Pedobear, and many others. The site's \"Random\" board, also known as \"/b/\", was the first board to be created, and is the one that receives the most traffic. The Random board has minimal rules on posted content. Gawker once jokingly claimed that \"reading /b/ will melt your brain\". The site's anonymous community and culture have often provoked media attention. \n\n4chan users have been instrumental in pranks such as hijacking Internet destinations to cause images of Rick Astley to appear in place of their content, coordinating attacks against other websites and Internet users, exposing animal abuse, and posting threats of violence in order to elicit individual and public reactions. \"The Guardian\" once summarized the 4chan community as \"lunatic, juvenile ... brilliant, ridiculous and alarming\".\n\nThe activity of 4chan takes place on message boards and imageboards. The website is split into six categories: Japanese culture, Interests, Creative, Adult (18+), Other, and Misc (18+). These provide for on-topic boards to discuss anime, manga, technology, sport, photography, music, hentai, torrents, travel, physical fitness, as well as a random board. 4chan originally hosted discussion boards on a separate domain called \"world4ch\", but these were later moved to the dis.4chan.org subdomain. The site has had at least one employee, a programmer whom 4chan's founder Christopher Poole met via online \"Tetris\". All other moderators are volunteers. As of 2011, the /b/ (Random), /v/ (Video games), /a/ (Anime and Manga), and /s/ (explicit images) boards were respectively the site's first, second, third, and fourth most popular boards.\n\n4chan is one of the Internet's most trafficked imageboards, according to the \"Los Angeles Times\". 4chan's Alexa rank is generally around 700, though it has been as high as number 56 at times. It is provided to its users free of charge and consumes a large amount of bandwidth; as a result, its financing has often been problematic. Poole acknowledges that donations alone cannot keep the site online, so he has turned to advertising to help make ends meet. However, the explicit content hosted on 4chan has deterred businesses who do not want to be associated with the site's content. In January 2009, Poole signed a new deal with an advertising company; in February 2009, he was $20,000 in debt, and the site was continuing to lose money. The 4chan servers were moved from Texas to California in August 2008, which upgraded the maximum bandwidth throughput of 4chan from 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s.\n\nUnlike most web forums, 4chan does not have a registration system, allowing users to post anonymously. Any nickname may be used when posting, even one that has been previously adopted, such as \"Anonymous\" or \"moot\". In place of registration, 4chan has provided tripcodes as an optional form of authenticating a poster's identity. As making a post without filling in the \"Name\" field causes posts to be attributed to \"Anonymous\", general understanding on 4chan holds that Anonymous is not a single person but a collective (hive) of users. Moderators generally post without a name even when performing sysop actions. A \"capcode\" may be used to attribute the post to \"Anonymous ## Mod\", although moderators often post without the capcode. In a 2011 interview on Nico Nico Douga, Poole explained that there are approximately 20 volunteer moderators active on 4chan. 4chan also has a junior moderation team, called \"janitors\", who may delete posts or images and suggest that the normal moderation team ban a user, but who cannot post with a capcode. Revealing oneself as a janitor is grounds for immediate dismissal.\n\n4chan has been the target of occasional denial of service attacks. For instance, on December 28, 2010, 4chan and other websites went down due to such an attack, following which Poole said on his blog, \"We now join the ranks of MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, et al.—an exclusive club!\"\n\n4chan was started in 2003 in the bedroom of Christopher Poole, a then-15-year-old student from New York City whose 4chan handle is \"moot\". Prior to starting 4chan, Poole had been a regular participant on the Something Awful forums. He intended 4chan to be an American counterpart to the popular Japanese Futaba Channel (\"2chan\") imageboard and a place to discuss manga and anime. Upon the creation of 4chan, Poole encouraged users from the Something Awful subforum titled \"Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse\", who also happened to be dissatisfied with the forum, to discuss anime on his website. Poole originally used the Futaba Channel to obtain anime-related images, and liked the concept of a message board where people anonymously shared images, which eventually led to his idea of creating a similar English-based website. During the creation of 4chan, he obtained the source code for the Futaba Channel website, and translated the Japanese text into English using AltaVista's Babel Fish online translator. During 4chan's earliest days, it had only two boards: \"/a/ – Anime/General\" and \"/b/ – Anime/Random\" (the very first board to be created); more boards were created over time, and /b/ was eventually renamed to simply \"/b/ – Random\".\n\nDuring the early days of 4chan, the boards that originally existed were the anime, random, cute, hentai, and yaoi boards; a lolicon board also existed at /l/, but after being disabled for a week around the turn of the year 2004 it was removed in October 2004. The /g/ board also was initially dedicated to guro, before it was deleted and later remade as the \"technology\" board. During 2004, 4chan briefly went offline, then returned fully online a few months later. Following 4chan's return, some non-anime related boards, such as the weapons, automobile, and video games boards, were introduced. In 2008, nine new boards were created, including the sports board at /sp/, the fashion board at /fa/ and the \"Japan/General\" (the name later changed to \"Otaku culture\") board at /jp/.\n\nIn January 2011, Poole announced the deletion of the /r9k/ (\"ROBOT9000\") and /new/ (News) boards, saying that /new/ had become devoted to racist discussions, and /r9k/ no longer served its original purpose of being a test implementation of xkcd's ROBOT9000 script. During the same year, the /soc/ board was created in an effort to reduce the number of socialization threads on /b/. /r9k/ was restored on October 23, 2011, along with /hc/ (\"Hardcore\", previously deleted), /pol/ (a rebranding of /new/) and the new /diy/ board, in addition to an apology by Poole where he recalls how he criticized the deletion of Encyclopedia Dramatica and realized that he had done the same.\n\nIn 2010, 4chan had implemented reCAPTCHA in an effort to thwart spam arising from JavaScript worms. By November 2011, 4chan made the transition to utilizing Cloudflare following a series of distributed denial of service attacks. The 4chan imageboards were rewritten in valid HTML5/CSS3 in May 2012 in an effort to improve client-side performance. On September 28, 2012, 4chan introduced a \"4chan pass\" that, when purchased, \"allows users to bypass typing a reCAPTCHA verification when posting and reporting posts on the 4chan image boards\"; the money raised from the passes will go towards supporting the site.\n\nOn January 21, 2015, moot stepped down as the site's administrator citing stress from controversies such as the Gamergate controversy as the reason for his departure. On September 21, 2015, moot announced that Hiroyuki Nishimura had purchased from him the ownership rights to 4chan, without disclosing the terms of the acquisition. Nishimura was the former administrator of 2channel between 1999 and 2014, the website forming the basis for anonymous posting culture which influenced later websites such as Futaba Channel and 4chan; Nishimura lost the rights for 2channel to ex-US Army officer Jim Watkins following financial difficulties and a series of scandals involving Nishimura's alleged data mining and sales of 2channel personal user data to political parties.\n\nIn October 2016, it was reported that the site was facing financial difficulties that could lead to its closure or radical changes. In a post titled \"Winter is Coming\", Hiroyuki Nishimura said, \"We had tried to keep 4chan as is. But I failed. I am sincerely sorry\", citing server costs, infrastructure costs, and network fees.\n\nOn November 17, 2018, it was announced that the site would be split into two, with the work-safe boards moved to a new domain, 4channel.org, while the NSFW boards would remain on the 4chan.org domain. In a series of posts on the topic, Nishimura explained that the split was due to 4chan being blacklisted by most advertising companies, and that the new 4channel domain would allow for the site to receive advertisements by mainstream ad providers.\n\nPoole kept his real-life identity hidden until it was revealed on July 9, 2008, in \"The Wall Street Journal\". Before that time he had used the alias \"moot\".\n\nIn April 2009, Poole was voted the world's most influential person of 2008 by an open Internet poll conducted by \"Time\" magazine. The results were questioned even before the poll completed, as automated voting programs and manual ballot stuffing were used to influence the vote. 4chan's interference with the vote seemed increasingly likely, when it was found that reading the first letter of the first 21 candidates in the poll spelled out a phrase containing two 4chan memes: \"mARBLECAKE. ALSO, THE GAME.\"\n\nOn September 12, 2009, Poole gave a talk on why 4chan has a reputation as a \"Meme Factory\" at the Paraflows Symposium in Vienna, Austria, which was part of the Paraflows 09 festival, themed Urban Hacking. In this talk, Poole mainly attributed this to the anonymous system, and to the lack of data retention on the site (\"The site has no memory.\").\n\nIn April 2010, Poole gave evidence in the trial \"United States of America v. David Kernell\" as a government witness. As a witness, he explained the terminology used on 4chan to the prosecutor, ranging from \"OP\" to \"lurker\". He also explained to the court the nature of the data given to the FBI as part of the search warrant, including how users can be uniquely identified from site audit logs.\n\n4chan has been labeled as the starting point of the Anonymous meme by The \"Baltimore City Paper\", due to the norm of posts signed with the \"Anonymous\" moniker. The \"National Post\"s David George-Cosh said it has been \"widely reported\" that Anonymous is associated with 4chan and 711chan, as well as numerous Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels.\n\nThrough its association with Anonymous, 4chan has become associated with Project Chanology, a worldwide protest against the Church of Scientology held by members of Anonymous. On January 15, 2008, a 4chan user posted to /b/, suggesting participants \"do something big\" against the Church of Scientology's website. This message resulted in the Church receiving threatening phone calls. It quickly grew into a large real-world protest. Unlike previous Anonymous attacks, this action was characterized by 4chan memes including rickrolls and Guy Fawkes masks. The raid drew criticism from some 4chan users who felt it would bring the site undesirable attention.\n\nAs of May 2017, 4chan hosts 71 imageboards, two of which are hidden, as well as one upload-only Flash board.\n\nThe \"random\" board, /b/, follows the design of Futaba Channel's Nijiura board. It was the first board created, and is by far 4chan's most popular board, with 30% of site traffic. Gawker's Nick Douglas summarized /b/ as a board where \"people try to shock, entertain, and coax free porn from each other.\" /b/ has a \"no rules\" policy, except for bans on certain illegal content, such as child pornography, invasions of other websites (posting floods of disruptive content), and under-18 viewing, all of which are inherited from site-wide rules. The \"no invasions\" rule was added in late 2006, after /b/ users spent most of the summer \"invading\" Habbo Hotel. The \"no rules\" policy also applies to actions of administrators and moderators, which means that users may be banned at any time, for any reason, including no reason at all. Due partially to its anonymous nature, board moderation is not always successful—indeed, the site's anti-child pornography rule is a subject of jokes on /b/. Christopher Poole told \"The New York Times\", in a discussion on the moderation of /b/, that \"the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards\" and that site staff simply provided a framework.\n\nThe humor of /b/'s many users, who refer to themselves as \"/b/tards\", is often incomprehensible to newcomers and outsiders, and is characterized by intricate inside jokes and dark comedy. Users often refer to each other, and much of the outside world, as fags. They are often referred to by outsiders as trolls, who regularly act with the intention of \"doing it for the lulz\": a corruption of \"LOL\" used to denote amusement at another's expense. \"The New York Observer\" has described posters as \"immature pranksters whose bad behavior is encouraged by the site's total anonymity and the absence of an archive\". Douglas said of the board, \"reading /b/ will melt your brain\", and cited Encyclopedia Dramatica's definition of /b/ as \"the asshole of the Internets [\"sic\"]\". Mattathias Schwartz of \"The New York Times\" likened /b/ to \"a high-school bathroom stall, or an obscene telephone party line\", while \"Baltimore City Paper\" wrote that \"in the high school of the Internet, /b/ is the kid with a collection of butterfly knives and a locker full of porn.\" \"Wired\" describes /b/ as \"notorious\".\n\nEach post is assigned a post number. Certain post numbers are sought after with a large amount of posting taking place to \"GET\" them. A \"GET\" occurs when a post's number ends in a special number, such as 12345678, 22222222, or every millionth post. A sign of 4chan's scaling, according to Poole, was when GETs lost meaning due to the high post rate resulting in a GET occurring every few weeks. He estimated /b/'s post rate in July 2008 to be 150,000–200,000 posts per day.\n\n/pol/ (\"Politically Incorrect\") is 4chan's political discussion board. A stickied thread on its front page states that the board's intended purpose is \"discussion of news, world events, political issues, and other related topics.\" /pol/ was created in October 2011 as a rebranding of 4chan's news board, /new/, which was deleted that January for a high volume of racist discussion.\n\nMedia sources have characterized /pol/ as predominantly racist and sexist, with many of its posts taking an explicitly neo-Nazi bent. The Southern Poverty Law Center regards /pol/'s rhetorical style as widely emulated by white supremacist websites such as \"The Daily Stormer\"; the \"Stormer\"s editor, Andrew Anglin, concurred.\n\n/pol/ was where screenshots of Trayvon Martin's hacked social media accounts were initially posted. The board's users have started antifeminist, homophobic, transphobic, and anti-Arab Twitter campaigns.\n\nMany /pol/ users favored Donald Trump during his 2016 United States presidential campaign. Both Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., appeared to acknowledge the support by tweeting /pol/-associated memes. Upon his successful election, a /pol/ moderator embedded a pro-Trump video at the top of all of the board's pages.\n\nMany Internet memes – catchphrases or images that spread quickly, peer to peer, across the Internet — have originated on 4chan, usually /b/, as its fast moving, crowd psychology nature enables content to quickly be passed on to large numbers of viewers.\nOther memes originating on the site have gained media attention of a lesser degree. These include \"So I herd u liek mudkipz\", which involves a phrase based on Pokémon and which generated numerous YouTube tribute videos, and the term \"an hero\" as a synonym for suicide, after a misspelling in the Myspace online memorial of seventh grader Mitchell Henderson. 4chan and other websites, such as the satirical Encyclopedia Dramatica, have also contributed to the development of significant amounts of leetspeak. of \"\" are also known to frequent 4chan, having had a board dedicated to their interest.\n\nA lolcat is an image combining a photograph of a cat with text intended to contribute humour. The text is often idiosyncratic and grammatically incorrect. In 2005, the meme was widely popularized by 4chan in the form of \"Caturday\". Every Saturday, users posted pictures of cats with image macros relating to that day's theme.\n\nIn 2005, a meme known as the \"duckroll\" began, after Poole used a word filter to change \"egg\" to \"duck\" across 4chan. Thus, words such as \"eggroll\" were changed to \"duckroll\". This led to a bait-and-switch in which external links disguised as relevant to a discussion instead led to a picture of a duck on wheels.\n\nAn unidentified 4chan user applied the concept of the duckroll to a 2007 post relating to the video game \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". In March of that year, the game's trailer had been released, and the game's immense popularity caused publisher Rockstar Games' website to crash. The user posted a YouTube link that purportedly led to the trailer, but in reality directed users to the music video for Rick Astley's 1987 song \"Never Gonna Give You Up\". Thus, the \"rickroll\" was born. In an interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\", Astley said he found the meme \"bizarre and funny\".\n\nA link to the YouTube video of Tay Zonday's song \"Chocolate Rain\" was posted on /b/ on July 11, 2007. \"The Age\" reported that 4chan posters urged each other to \"swarm\" the video on YouTube and thus increase its ranking. The video became an immensely popular Internet meme, resulting in cover versions by John Mayer and Green Day drummer Tré Cool. The portion of the song in which Zonday turns away from the microphone, with a caption stating \"I move away from the mic to breathe in\", became an oft-repeated meme on 4chan and inspired remixes.\n\nThe character of Boxxy is portrayed by Catherine \"Catie\" Wayne, an American Internet celebrity known for her highly energetic vlogs. Her rise to exposure began in late 2008 and early 2009, surrounding self-made videos that were initially made to be posted to her Gaia Online profile. They then spread to 4chan and other sites, resulting in a large online following.\n\nIn his American incarnation, Pedobear is an anthropomorphic bear child predator that is often used within the community to mock contributors showing a sexual interest in children. Pedobear is one of the most popular memes on non-English imageboards, and has gained recognition across Europe. In February 2010, a photoshopped version of Pedobear appeared along with mascots of the 2010 Winter Olympics in an article on the games in \"Gazeta Olsztyńska\", a Polish newspaper. This was done accidentally; due to the image being used from Google Images, the authors were unaware of the joke. Similarly, the Dutch television guide \"Avrobode\" used one of the images. It has been used as a symbol of pedophilia by Maltese graffiti vandals prior to a papal visit.\n\nOn February 15, 2009, a user uploaded two YouTube videos that showed the physical abuse of a domestic cat named Dusty by a person calling himself \"Timmy\". The 4chan community was able to track down the originator of the videos, a fourteen-year-old from Lawton, Oklahoma, and passed his details to his local police department. As a result of this, a suspect was arrested and the cat was treated by a veterinarian and taken to a safe place.\n\nOn July 30, 2014, an anonymous user made a reply in a thread on the board /pol/ \"Politically Incorrect\" of 4chan, criticizing modern art in an ironic fashion, saying:\n\nLess than an hour later the post was photographed off the screen and framed by another user who posted another reply in the thread with a photo of the framed quote. Later the user, after endorsement by other anonymous users in the thread, created an auction on eBay for the framed photo which quickly rose to high prices, culminating in a price of $90,900.00.\n\nAccording to the \"Washington Post\", \"the site's users have managed to pull off some of the highest-profile collective actions in the history of the Internet.\"\n\nUsers of 4chan and other websites \"raided\" Hal Turner by launching DDoS attacks and prank calling his phone-in radio show during December 2006 and January 2007. The attacks caused Turner's website to go offline. This cost thousands of dollars of bandwidth bills according to Turner. In response, Turner sued 4chan, 7chan, and other websites; however, he lost his plea for an injunction and failed to receive letters from the court.\n\nKTTV Fox 11 aired a report on Anonymous, calling them a group of \"hackers on steroids\", \"domestic terrorists\", and collectively an \"Internet hate machine\" on July 26, 2007. Slashdot founder Rob Malda posted a comment made by another Slashdot user, Miang, stating that the story focused mainly on users of \"4chan, 7chan and 420chan\". Miang claimed that the report \"seems to confuse /b/ raids and motivational poster templates with a genuine threat to the American public\", arguing that the \"unrelated\" footage of a van exploding shown in the report was to \"equate anonymous posting with domestic terror\".\n\nOn July 10, 2008, the swastika CJK unicode character (卐) appeared at the top of Google's Hot Trends list—a tally of the most popular search terms in the United States—for several hours. It was later reported that the HTML numeric character reference for the symbol had been posted on /b/, with a request to perform a Google search for the string. A multitude of /b/ visitors followed the order and pushed the symbol to the top of the chart, though Google later removed the result.\n\nLater that year, the private Yahoo! Mail account of Sarah Palin, Republican vice presidential candidate in the 2008 United States presidential election, was hacked by a 4chan user. The hacker posted the account's password on /b/, and screenshots from within the account to WikiLeaks. A /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of him sending an email to a friend of Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread. However, he forgot to blank out the password in the screenshot. A multitude of /b/ users attempted to log in with the new password, and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo!. The incident was criticized by some /b/ users, in that most reports on the hack focused on 4chan, rather than Palin's violation of campaign law. One user commented, \"seriously, /b/. We could have changed history and failed, epically.\" The FBI and Secret Service began investigating the incident shortly after its occurrence. On September 20 it was revealed they were questioning David Kernell, the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell.\n\nThe stock price of Apple Inc. fell significantly in October 2008 after a hoax story was submitted to CNN's user-generated news site iReport.com claiming that company CEO Steve Jobs had suffered a major heart attack. The source of the story was traced back to 4chan.\n\nIn May 2009, members of the site attacked YouTube, posting pornographic videos on the site. A 4chan member acknowledged being part of the attack, telling the BBC that it was in response to YouTube \"deleting music\". In January 2010, members of the site attacked YouTube again in response to the suspension of YouTube user lukeywes1234 for failing to meet the minimum age requirement of thirteen. The videos uploaded by the user had apparently become popular with 4chan members, who subsequently became angered after the account was suspended and called for a new wave of pornographic videos to be uploaded to YouTube on January 6, 2010. Later the same year, 4chan made numerous disruptive pranks directed at singer Justin Bieber.\n\nIn September 2010, in retaliation against the Bollywood film industry's hiring of Aiplex Software to launch cyberattacks against The Pirate Bay, Anonymous members, recruited through posts on 4chan boards, subsequently initiated their own attacks, dubbed Operation Payback, targeting the website of the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America. The targeted websites usually went offline for a short period of time due to the attacks, before recovering.\n\nThe website of the UK law firm , which was associated with an anti-piracy client, was affected by the cyber-attack. In retaliation for the initial attacks being called only a minor nuisance, Anonymous launched more attacks, bringing the site down yet again. After coming back up, the front page accidentally revealed a backup file of the entire website, which contained over 300 megabytes of private company emails, which were leaked to several torrents and across several sites on the Internet.\nIt has been suggested that the data leak could cost the law firm up to £500,000 in fines for breaching British Data Protection Laws.\nIn January 2011, BBC News reported that the law firm have announced they are to stop \"chasing illegal file-sharers\". Head of ACS:Law Andrew Crossley in a statement to a court addressed issues which influenced the decision to back down \"I have ceased my work ... I have been subject to criminal attack. My e-mails have been hacked. I have had death threats and bomb threats.\"\n\nIn August 2012, 4chan users attacked a third-party sponsored Mountain Dew campaign, \"Dub the Dew\", where users were asked to submit and vote on name ideas for a green apple flavor of the drink. Users submitted entries such as \"Diabeetus\", \"Fapple\", several variations of \"Gushing Granny\", and \"Hitler did nothing wrong\".\n\nOn October 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League officials in Miami, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, and Cleveland about a possible threat involving the simultaneous use of dirty bombs at stadiums. The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, the final day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. The threats came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.\nBrahm did not expect the message to be taken seriously since he \"would never take anything posted on 4chan as fact\"; an FBI official was quoted as saying the \"credibility of [the threat] was beyond ridiculous\". As a parody of the incident, 4chan temporarily added \"Don't mess with football\" as an additional rule for /b/. On October 20, 2006, Brahm turned himself in to federal authorities, and was charged with fabricating a fake terrorist threat and taken into custody. On February 28, 2008, he pleaded guilty to the federal charges. On June 5, 2008, he was sentenced to six months in prison, six months' house arrest, and ordered to pay $26,750 in restitution.\n\nAround midnight on September 11, 2007, a student posted photographs of mock pipe bombs and another photograph of him holding them while saying he would blow up his high school—Pflugerville High School in Pflugerville, Texas—at 9:11 am on September 11. Users of 4chan helped to track him down by finding the perpetrator's father's name in the Exif data of a photograph he took, and contacted the police. He was arrested before school began that day. The incident turned out to be a hoax; the \"weapons\" were toys and there were no actual bombs.\n\nJarrad Willis, a 20-year-old from Melbourne, Australia was arrested on December 8, 2007, after apparently posting on 4chan that he was \"going to shoot and kill as many people as I can until which time I am incapacitated or killed by the police\". The post, accompanied by an image of another man holding a shotgun, threatened a shopping mall near Beverly Hills. While the investigation was still open, Willis was charged with criminal defamation for a separate incident but died before the case was heard.\n\nOn February 4, 2009, a posting on the 4chan /b/ board said there would be a school shooting at St Eskils Gymnasium in Eskilstuna, Sweden, leading 1250 students and 50 teachers to be evacuated. A 21-year-old man was arrested after 4chan provided the police with the IP address of the poster. Police said that the suspect called it off as a joke, and they released him after they found no indication that the threat was serious.\n\nOn January 21, 2014, an anonymous poster started a thread on /b/ identifying a student named Westley Sullivan who apparently went to the same high school as the poster. The original post included a link to Westley Sullivan's Facebook profile, which has since been taken down, and a screenshot of a post which said \"if fairview isnt closed tomorrow im going to blow it up\", referring to Sullivan's high school, Fairview High School, in Boyd County, Kentucky. A few anonymous individuals went to Sullivan's Facebook profile and found his address, phone number, school ID number, school schedule and teachers, and other personal information. Information like his teachers and ID number had been posted directly, and the more personal information like his address was found in the EXIF data of some of the pictures posted on his profile. These individuals then contacted Fairview school officials and the local police department, as well as the FBI. The next day it was learned that police had arrested Sullivan in his home and he had been charged with 2nd degree terroristic threatening, a Class D felony in Kentucky.\n\nOn June 28, 2018, a man named Eric M. Radulovic was arrested following an indictment by the U.S. Department of Justice \"on one count of transmitting in interstate and foreign commerce a threat to injure the person of another.\" The indictment alleged that Radulovic posted anonymously to /pol/ the day after the Unite the Right rally, communicating an intention to attack protestors at an upcoming right-wing demonstration, ostensibly to elicit sympathy for the alt-right movement. \"I’m going to bring a Remington 700 and start shooting Alt-right guys. We need sympathy after that landwhale got all the liberals teary eyed, so someone is going to have to make it look like the left is becoming more violent and radicalized. It’s a false flag for sure, but I’ll be aiming for the more tanned/dark haired muddied jeans in the crowd so real whites won’t have to worry,\" wrote Radulovic, according to the indictment.\n\nOn November 29, 2010, Ali Saad, a 19-year-old, was arrested and had his home raided by the FBI for posting child pornography and death threats on 4chan. Ali had first visited 4chan \"a week before [the FBI raid] happened\". He admitted to downloading about 25 child pornography images from 4chan.\n\nIn January 2011, Matthew Riskin Bean, a 20-year-old man from New Jersey, was sentenced to 45 days in prison for cyberbullying on 4chan.\n\nCollin Campbell, a U.S. Navy Machinist's Mate, was arrested in February 2011 after a fellow seaman found child pornography on his iPhone that he downloaded entirely from 4chan.\n\nRonald Ohlson, 37, was raided April 2011 at his upstate New York home by the Department of Homeland Security after he obtained child pornography from 4chan.\n\nAfter 4chan reported a 15-year-old boy in California who posted child pornography, the United States Department of Homeland Security raided his home on June 7, 2011, and took all of his electronic items.\n\nOn February 17, 2012, Thaddeus McMichael was arrested by the FBI for child pornography charges after posting comments on Facebook claiming that he possessed child pornography.

The images were initially posted on 4chan. As a result of the incident, 4chan announced that it would enforce a Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy, which would allow content owners to remove material that had been shared on the site illegally, and would ban users who repeatedly posted stolen material.\n\nAlso in August 2014, 4chan was involved in the Gamergate controversy, which began with unsubstantiated allegations about indie game developer Zoë Quinn from an ex-boyfriend, followed by false allegations from anonymous Internet users. The allegations were followed by a harassment campaign against several women in the video game industry, organized by 4chan users.\nDiscussion regarding Gamergate was banned on 4chan due to alleged rule violations, and Gamergate supporters moved to alternate forums such as 8chan.\n\nAccording to court documents filed on November 5, 2014, there were images posted to 4chan that appeared to be of a murder victim. The body was discovered in Port Orchard, Washington, after the images were posted. The posts were accompanied by the text: \"Turns out it's way harder to strangle someone to death than it looks on the movies.\" A later post said: \"Check the news for Port Orchard, Washington, in a few hours. Her son will be home from school soon. He'll find her, then call the cops. I just wanted to share the pics before they find me.\" The victim was Amber Lynn Coplin, aged 30. The suspect, 33-year-old David Michael Kalac, surrendered to police in Oregon later the same day; he was charged with second-degree murder involving domestic violence. Kalac was convicted in April 2017 and was sentenced to 82 years in prison the following month.\n\nOn July 26, 2009, AT&T's DSL branch temporarily blocked access to the img.4chan.org domain (host of /b/ and /r9k/), which was initially believed to be an attempt at Internet censorship, and met with hostility on 4chan's part. The next day, AT&T issued a statement claiming that the block was put in place after an AT&T customer was affected by a DoS attack originating from IP addresses connected to \"img.4chan.org\", and was an attempt to \"prevent this attack from disrupting service for the impacted AT&T customer, and... our other customers.\" AT&T maintains that the block was not related to the content on 4chan.\n\n4chan's founder Christopher Poole responded with the following:\n\nMajor news outlets have reported that the issue may be related to the DDoS-ing of 4chan, and that 4chan users suspected the then-owner of Swedish-based website \"Anontalk.com\".\n\nOn February 4, 2010, 4chan started receiving reports from Verizon Wireless customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site's image boards. After investigating, Poole found out that only the traffic on port 80 to the \"boards.4chan.org\" domain was affected, leading members to believe that the block was intentional. Three days later, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan was \"explicitly blocked\". The block was lifted several days later.\n\n\n"}

Main plot elements include quests for lost continents and exotic setting; the creation of empires, characters embarking on treasure and heroic journeys, travels, explorations, quests and searches for the unknown usually also having to overcome an adversary. Adventure films are often set in a period background and may include adapted stories of historical or fictional adventure heroes within the historical context. Kings, battles, rebellion or piracy are commonly seen. Adventure films may also be combined with other movie genres such as action, animation, comedy, drama, fantasy, science fiction, family, horror or war.\n\nAdventure film popularity peaked in the 1930s and 1940s, when films such as \"Captain Blood\", \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" and \"The Mark of Zorro\" were regularly made with major stars, notably Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power, who were closely associated with the genre. Saturday morning serials used many of the same thematic elements as high-budget adventure films.\n\nIn the early days of adventure films, the protagonists were mainly male. These heroes were courageous, often fighting suppression and facing tyrants. Recent adventure films have featured heroines, such as Lara Croft, as protagonists.\n\nAdventure films can contain stock characters and stereotypes. In some cases, this has been accused of going as far as implicit racism; claimed examples of this are \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\", \"First Blood\" and James Bond \"kicking third-world people around\" in \"Dr. No\".\n\n"}

The works are derived from the entertainment genre of pantomime that developed in England, presented either as they are in Britain or adapted for the American stage and tailored to American audiences. Pantomime in America, as in England, is usually performed at Christmas time. The entertainments, aimed at families, are based on nursery stories and fairy tales, and they incorporate songs (traditional, popular and new), slapstick comedy, often topical jokes, magic, some cross-dressing, local references, audience participation, and mild adult innuendo. \n\nAlthough pantomime was not frequently produced in the US during the 20th century and is not well known in America, productions of pantomime, both professional and amateur, have been seen nearly every year somewhere in the US over the past couple of decades.\n\nThe earliest known pantomime in the U.S. was \"Robinson Crusoe\" produced at St. John's Theatre, New York in 1786. A production at Olympic Theatre in New York of \"Humpty Dumpty\" ran for over 1,200 performances in 1868, becoming one of the most successful American pantomimes.\n\nAmerican pantomime, like the British pantomime, incorporates audience participation.\n\nIn 1993 there was a production of \"Cinderella\" at the UCLA Freud Theatre, starring Zsa Zsa Gabor. Pantomonium Productions has produced pantomimes annually in New York City since 2004. Stages Repertory Theatre in Houston, Texas, has been performing original pantomime-style musicals during the Christmas holidays since 2008: \"Panto Sleeping Beauty\", \"Panto Pinocchio\", \"Panto Red Riding Hood\", \"Panto Mother Goose\" and \"Panto Goldilocks\". Since 2004, People's Light and Theatre Company, in Malvern, Pennsylvania, has been presenting an annual Christmas pantomime season.\n\nLythgoe Family Productions has produced pantomimes each winter since 2010 in California. Their first production was \"Cinderella\" in North Hollywood, starring Jerry Mathers and Freddie Stroma. This was followed in 2011 by \"A Snow White Christmas\", starring Marina Sirtis as The Wicked Queen and Neil Patrick Harris as The Magic Mirror, and \"A Cinderella Christmas\", starring Fred Willard as Baron Hardup, Cinderella's father. In 2012, the company mounted \"A Snow White Christmas\" at the Pasadena Playhouse, starring Ariana Grande as Snow White, Charlene Tilton as The Wicked Queen and Neil Patrick Harris again as The Magic Mirror.

This film was surprising in that it showed a provocative \"sexy side\" of Ms. Young, quite different from her usual dignified brunette \"nice girl\" part.\n\nIn late 1954, Jeff Chandler said this was his favorite among the films he had made.\n\nA sexy blonde, still a little fresh off the farm, Christine Carroll (Loretta Young) is preparing to marry her handsome boyfriend. She finds out too late that her fiancé Mike (Alex Nicol) is a gangster and, once he slips stolen merchandise into her purse, she becomes his unwitting accessory. Though she goes to jail, she is innocent of the crime.\n\nThrough the kindness of prison psychiatrist Dr. Breen (Alexander Scourby), Christine turns her life around in prison, becoming a nurse's aide in the infirmary. Upon her release, Christine gets a job at a respectable hospital, where she falls in love with wounded combat pilot Steve Kimberly (Jeff Chandler), an architect from good family. Will she ever be able to reveal her sordid past without sending the emotionally fragile Steve off the deep end?\n\nWhen it's clear that Steve has fallen hard, she faces the dilemma of what and when to tell him. Christine's probation officer encourages her to tell him the truth. But his wounded psyche makes her decide to keep her past a secret. They marry and Christine is a downright sexy newlywed on her honeymoon.\n\nHer decision has melodramatic consequences... but not at first. As long as her old boyfriend is locked up in prison, and with her name change, Christine believes she is safe. She and Steve have a happy marriage, and soon announce the birth of a child, though Steve shows he isn’t completely well, a little reluctant at first to share Christine even with a child. But after the new addition, a lovely daughter, he seems more stable and happy.\n\nChristine devotes herself to her husband and daughter. All is wonderful until her old gangster boyfriend Mike, fresh out of prison, shows up one day, holding her daughter and letting her play with his gun. Christine pleads with him to release the child - she has no money but offers him all she has if Mike will just leave.\n\nHe is willing to let bygones be bygones as long as she drives him down south of the border into Mexico. He promises if she will do that, he will never bother her again. Trapped, she agrees. But nothing turns out as he promises. After another robbery, there is a high-speed chase and a crash. Mike is killed instantly. Christine and daughter survive the wreck physically, but there are plenty of emotional problems as a result.\n\nAn enraged Steve accuses Christine (while still in the hospital recuperating from the wreck) of being a tramp and immediately files for divorce, gaining full custody of the child. He refuses to listen to her side of the story, only taking her prison record, the fact that she was with her old gangster boyfriend and fact that she put his daughter in danger.\n\nCrushed, forbidden from seeing her daughter, she looks to fill the hours. Christine takes a job as an assistant for a magician. One day she meets up with her sister-in-law, Steve's twin, who comes to her aid. Christine is asked to perform with the clown at a children's party. Since this is years later, the child does not know that Loretta is her mother. She falls in love with the Magic Lady, who agrees to come to her house for a few days and show her some attention and love. Unexpectedly, Steve comes home and there are fireworks. Christine points out that their daughter has serious problems and needs the care of a mother. She leaves quietly, ready to never see her child again.\n\nBut Christine's magic has cast its spell; Steve looks for her and finds her at her parents' farm, taking a splint off of an animal. Steve is no longer the emotionally fragile patient; he has healed. Once he got over his anger at his sister's subterfuge, he searched his soul to realize that he needs her now as an equal partner to share life with and to help his daughter grow up to be a strong young woman.\n\n\nThe film was Loretta Young's first movie at Universal since her days when she was an extra.\n\nIt was known as \"The Magic Lady\". Filming for this film started on April 15, 1952.\n\nLoretta Young said she found Jeff Chandler very attractive and he told her that he was falling in love with her. She further stated that the relationship never progressed beyond hand-holding outside their love scenes, \"but I think until he died, we both felt it. If I'd see him on the street I'd walk the other way because I didn't want to spark anything.\"\n\nThe title song, \"Because of You\", was Tony Bennett's first hit recording, reaching #1 in 1951 and becoming one of his many signature songs.\n\nAccording to Loretta Young's biographer, \"\"Because of You\" was a sleeper hit, a film that performs way beyond expectations and was held over a couple of weeks at the Roxy Theatre in New York.\"\n\nThe film currently has a 6.7/10 rating on IMDb and a 2.5/5 rating on AllMovie.\n\nIn 1998, Universal released the film in 1998 on VHS tape. However, the movie has not had an official DVD release in any region. As a result, only bootleg DVD-R copies of the film exist, most of which are video transfers from the official VHS tape.\n\n\n\n"}

Business went well, and in 1968, with brother Carl Staton, they opened The Jack and Jill's Cue Club in Arlington, Virginia, one of the top- pool rooms in the 1960s and 1970s, with 32 tables, a pro shop, a snack bar, and a tournament area that seated 180 with tiered seating.

{"id": "3301146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3301146", "title": "Break a leg", "text": "Break a leg\n\n\"Break a leg\" is an idiom in theatre used to wish a performer \"good luck\" in an ironic way. Well-wishers typically say \"Break a leg\" to actors and musicians before they go on stage to perform. The origin of the phrase remains obscure.\n\nThe expression reflects a theatrical superstition in which wishing a person \"good luck\" is considered bad luck. The expression is sometimes used outside the theatre as superstitions and customs travel through other professions and then into common use. Among professional dancers, the traditional saying is not \"break a leg,\" but \"\"merde\"\".\n\nUrbane Irish nationalist Robert Wilson Lynd published an article, \"A Defence of Superstition\", in the 1 October 1921 edition of the \"New Statesman\", a British liberal political and cultural magazine. Lynd regarded the theatre as the second-most superstitious institution in England, after horse racing. In horse racing, Lynd asserted, to wish a man luck is considered unlucky, so \"You should say something insulting such as, 'May you break your leg! Lynd did not attribute the phrase in any way to theatre people, though he was familiar with many of them and frequently mingled with actors backstage. Break a leg is most commonly used to wish an actor in audition to be part of the cast; hence the term \"break a leg\".\n\nThe earliest known example in print is from Edna Ferber's 1939 \"A Peculiar Treasure\" in which she writes about the fascination of the theater, \"...and all the understudies sitting in the back row politely wishing the various principals would break a leg\". In Bernard Sobel's 1948 \"The Theatre Handbook and Digest of Plays\", he writes about theatrical superstitions: \"...before a performance actors never wish each other good luck, but say 'I hope you break a leg. There is anecdotal evidence from theatrical memoirs and personal letters as early as the 1920s.\n\nThere are several theories behind the origin of the phrase. Few are supported by contemporary writings. The theories listed below are some of the more popular explanations.\n\nThe edge of a stage was marked with a line known as the \"leg\" or \"leg line\". Beyond this point, one could be seen by the audience and those not required to be on stage had to remain back stage and not cross (break) the \"leg line\". In a time when performers would queue for an opportunity to perform and were only paid if they did perform, to \"break a leg\" meant the performer crossed the line onto the stage and would therefore get paid. So to tell a performer to \"break a leg\" was to wish them the luck to have the opportunity to perform and get paid. The sentiment remains the same today, \"good luck, give a good performance\".\n\nSimilarly, in the days of vaudeville, companies would book more performers than could possibly make it onstage, but would only pay those who performed. Since the Renaissance, stage curtain \"legs\" have been used as part of the masking in proscenium theaters, which remain the most popular style of theater to this day. Thus, to make it on stage, one had to enter the line of sight of the audience or \"break a leg\", to be paid.\n\nTo \"break a leg\" is archaic slang for bowing or curtsying; placing one foot behind the other and bending at the knee \"breaks\" the line of the leg. In theatre, pleased audiences may applaud for an extended time allowing the cast to take multiple curtain calls, bowing to the audience. \n\nRelated to this, some argue the mechanism for raising and lowering the curtain was controlled by a crank arm 'leg'. Therefore for popular performers, continued curtain calls may result in a broken crank arm.\n\nIn the time of Ancient Greece, people didn't clap. Instead, they stomped for their appreciation and if they stomped long enough, they would break a leg. Or, some would have it that the term originated during Elizabethan times when, instead of applause the audience would bang their chairs on the ground—and if they liked it enough, the leg of the chair would break.\n\nSome etymologists believe it to be an adaptation from the Yiddish translation into German. The phrase \"Hatsloche un Broche\" (הצלחה און ברכה) (\"success and blessing\") had been calqued from the German phrase \"Hals- und Beinbruch\" (\"neck and leg fracture\"), because of its similar pronunciation. The autobiography of Manfred von Richthofen records pilots of the German air force during the First World War as using the phrase \"Hals- und Beinbruch\" (neck and leg fracture) to wish each other luck before a flight. The phrase is now most typically used to wish an actor good luck before a performance, or a student good luck before an exam.\n\nOne popular, but false, etymology derives the phrase from the 1865 assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The story goes that John Wilkes Booth, the actor turned assassin, claimed in his diary that he broke his leg leaping to the stage of Ford's Theatre after murdering the President. While Booth's roles as an actor are not well remembered, wishing an actor to \"break a leg\" is to wish them a performance worthy of remembrance. However, the fact that actors did not start wishing each other to \"break a leg\" until the 1920s (more than 50 years later) makes this an unlikely source. Furthermore the phrase has distinct origins in other languages that well predate the late 19th century. Also, some historians contend that he broke his leg when he fell from his horse trying to escape. They also cite that Booth often exaggerated and falsified his diary entries to make them more dramatic.\n\nThere is an older meaning of \"break a leg\" going back to the 17th and 18th Century that refers to having \"a bastard / natural child\". \n\nThere are many non-literal references this expression could be referring to.\n\nSome attribute the line to a performance of Shakespeare's \"Richard III\", where the famed 18th-century British actor, David Garrick, became so entranced in the performance that he was unaware of a fracture.\n\nProfessional dancers do not wish each other good luck by saying \"break a leg\"; instead they say \"Merde!\", the French word for \"shit\". In turn, theater people have picked up this usage and may wish each other \"merde\", alone or in combination with \"break a leg\". In Spanish, the phrase is \"mucha mierda\", or \"lots of shit\". This term refers to the times when carriages would take the audience to the theatre. A quick look to the street in front of the venue would tell if the play was successful: a lot of horse dung would mean many carriages had stopped to leave spectators.\n\nOpera singers use \"Toi toi toi\", an idiom used to ward off a spell or hex, often accompanied by knocking on wood, and onomatopoeic, spitting (or imitating the sound of spitting). Saliva traditionally had demon-banishing powers. From Rotwelsch \"tof\", from Yiddish \"tov\" (\"good\", derived from the Hebrew טוב and with phonetic similarities to the Old German word for \"Devil\"). One explanation sees \"toi toi toi\" as the onomatopoeic rendition of spitting three times. Spitting three times over someone's head or shoulder is a gesture to ward off evil spirits. A similar-sounding expression for verbal spitting occurs in modern Hebrew as \"Tfu, tfu\" (here, only twice), which some say that Hebrew-speakers borrowed from Russian.\n\nAn alternate operatic good luck charm, originating from Italy, is the phrase \"\"in bocca al lupo!\" (\"In the mouth of the wolf\") with the response \"Crepi il lupo!\" (\"May the wolf die\")\n(see \"Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Myth & Legend\").\n\nIn Australia, the term \"chookas\"\" has been used also. According to one oral tradition, one of the performers would check audience numbers. If there were not many in the seats, the performers would have bread to eat following the performance. If the theatre was full they could then have \"chooks\"—Australian slang for chicken—for dinner. Therefore, if it was a full house, the performer would call out \"Chookas!\" It is now used by performers prior to a show regardless of the number of patrons; and may be a wish for a successful turnout.\n\n\n"}

The cello is used as a solo instrument, as well as in chamber music ensembles (e.g., string quartet), string orchestras, as a member of the string section of symphony orchestras, most modern Chinese orchestras, and some types of rock bands. \n\nMusic for the cello is generally written in the bass clef, but both tenor clef and treble clef are used for higher-range parts, both in orchestral/chamber music parts and in solo cello works. A person who plays the cello is called a \"cellist\" or \"violoncellist\". In a small classical ensemble, such as a string quartet, the cello typically plays the bass part, the lowest-pitched musical line of the piece. In an orchestra of the Baroque era (ca. 1600–1750) and Classical period (ca. 1725–1800), the cello typically plays the bass part, generally doubled an octave lower by the double basses. In Baroque-era music, the cello is often used to play the basso continuo bassline, typically along with a keyboard instrument (e.g., pipe organ or harpsichord) or a fretted, plucked stringed instrument (e.g., lute or theorbo). In such a Baroque performance, the cello player might be joined or replaced by other bass instruments, playing bassoon, double bass, viol or other low-register instruments.\n\nThe name \"cello\" is derived from the ending of the Italian \"violoncello\", which means \"little violone\". The violone (\"big viol\") was the lowest-pitched instrument of the viol family, the group of stringed instruments that went out of fashion around the end of the 17th century in most countries except France, where they survived another half-century before the louder violin family came into greater favour in that country as well. In modern symphony orchestras, it is the second largest stringed instrument (the double bass is the largest). Thus, the name \"violoncello\" contained both the augmentative \"-one\" (\"big\") and the diminutive \"-cello\" (\"little\"). By the turn of the 20th century, it had become common to shorten the name to 'cello, with the apostrophe indicating the missing stem. It is now customary to use \"cello\" without apostrophe as the full designation. \"Viol\" is derived from the root \"viola\", which was derived from Medieval Latin \"vitula\", meaning stringed instrument.\n\nCellos are tuned in fifths, starting with C (two octaves below middle C), followed by G, D, and then A. It is tuned in the same intervals as the viola, but an octave lower. Unlike the violin or viola but similar to the double bass, the cello has an endpin that rests on the floor to support the instrument's weight. The cello is most closely associated with European classical music, and has been described as the closest sounding instrument to the human voice. The instrument is a part of the standard orchestra, as part of the string section, and is the bass voice of the string quartet (although many composers give it a melodic role as well), as well as being part of many other chamber groups.\n\nAmong the most well-known Baroque works for the cello are Johann Sebastian Bach's six unaccompanied Suites. The cello possibly figures as a member of the basso continuo group in chamber works by Francesca Caccini (1587–1641), Barbara Strozzi (1619–1677) with pieces such as \"Il primo libro di madrigali, per 2–5 voci e basso continuo, op. 1\" and Elisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre (1665–1729) who wrote six sonatas for violin and basso continuo.\n\nFrom the Classical era, the two concertos by Joseph Haydn in C major and D major stand out, as do the five sonatas for cello and pianoforte of Ludwig van Beethoven, which span the important three periods of his compositional evolution. A \"Divertimento for Piano, Clarinet, Viola and Cello\" is among the surviving works by Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1739–1807).\n\nA review of compositions for cello in the Romantic era must include the German composer Fanny Mendelssohn (1805–1847) who wrote the Fantasy in G minor for cello and piano and a Capriccio in A-flat for cello. Other well-known works of the era include the Robert Schumann Concerto, the Antonín Dvořák Concerto as well as the two sonatas and the Double Concerto by Johannes Brahms.\n\nCompositions from the late-19th and early 20th century include three cello sonatas (including the Cello Sonata in C Minor written in 1880) by Dame Ethel Smyth (1858–1944), Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto in E minor, Claude Debussy's Sonata for Cello and Piano, and unaccompanied cello sonatas by Zoltán Kodály and Paul Hindemith. Pieces including cello were written by American Music Cente founder Marion Bauer (1882–1955) (two trio sonatas for flute, cello and piano) and Ruth Crawford Seeger (1901–1953) (Diaphonic suite No. 2 for bassoon and cello).\n\nPolish composer Grażyna Bacewicz (1909–1969) was writing for cello in the mid 20th century with Concerto No. 1 for Cello and Orchestra (1951), Concerto No. 2 for Cello and Orchestra (1963) and in 1964 composed her Quartet for four cellos. The cello's versatility made it popular with many male composers in this era as well, such as Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich, Benjamin Britten, György Ligeti, Witold Lutoslawski and Henri Dutilleux.\n\nWell-known cellists include Jacqueline du Pre, Raya Garbousova, Zara Nelsova, Hildur Gudnadottir, Han-Na Chang, Mstislav Rostropovich and Beatrice Harrison. Others include Anner Bylsma, Yo-Yo Ma, Pablo Casals, Julian Lloyd Webber, Alfred Wallenstein, Mischa Maisky and Gregor Piatigorsky. See the comprehensive list of cellists here.\n\nIn the 2010s, the instrument is found in popular music, but was more commonly used in 1970s pop and disco music. Today it is sometimes featured in pop and rock recordings, examples of which are noted later in this article. The cello has also recently appeared in major hip-hop and R & B performances, such as singers Rihanna and Ne-Yo's performance at the American Music Awards. The instrument has also been modified for Indian classical music by Nancy Lesh and Saskia Rao-de Haas.\n\nThe violin family, including cello-sized instruments, emerged c. 1500 as family of instruments distinct from the viola da gamba family. The earliest depictions of the violin family, from northern Italy c. 1530, show three sizes of instruments, roughly corresponding to what we now call violins, violas, and cellos. Contrary to a popular misconception, the cello did not evolve from the viola da gamba, but existed alongside it for about two and a half centuries. The violin family is also known as the viola da braccio (meaning viola of the arm) family, a reference to the primary way the members of the family are held. This is to distinguish it from the viola da gamba (meaning viola of the leg) family, in which all the members are all held with the legs. The likely predecessors of the violin family include the lira da braccio and the rebec. The earliest surviving cellos are made by Andrea Amati, the first known member of the celebrated Amati family of luthiers.\n\nThe direct ancestor to the violoncello was the bass violin. Monteverdi referred to the instrument as \"basso de viola da braccio\" in \"Orfeo\" (1607). Although the first bass violin, possibly invented as early as 1538, was most likely inspired by the viol, it was created to be used in consort with the violin. The bass violin was actually often referred to as a \"violone\", or \"large viola\", as were the viols of the same period. Instruments that share features with both the bass violin and the \"viola da gamba\" appear in Italian art of the early 16th century.\n\nThe invention of wire-wound strings (fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in Bologna, allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play virtuosic passages. This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by organ, theorbo or violone.\n\nAround 1700, Italian players popularized the cello in northern Europe, although the bass violin (basse de violon) continued to be used for another two decades in France. Many existing bass violins were literally cut down in size to convert them into cellos according to the smaller pattern developed by Stradivarius, who also made a number of old pattern large cellos (the 'Servais'). The sizes, names, and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time. The size was not standardized until around 1750.\n\nDespite similarities to the viola da gamba, the cello is actually part of the viola da braccio family, meaning \"viol of the arm\", which includes, among others, the violin and viola. Though paintings like Bruegel's \"The Rustic Wedding\", and Jambe de Fer in his \"Epitome Musical\" suggest that the bass violin had alternate playing positions, these were short-lived and the more practical and ergonomic \"a gamba\" position eventually replaced them entirely.\nBaroque-era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing. Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor), while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of gut, with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello, resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.\n\nFew educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century, and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique. One of the earliest cello manuals is Michel Corrette's \"Méthode, thèorique et pratique pour apprendre en peu de temps le violoncelle dans sa perfection\" (Paris, 1741).\n\nCellos are part of the standard symphony orchestra, which usually includes eight to twelve cello players. The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on stage left (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The \"principal\" cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, playing solos and leading entrances (when the section begins to play its part). Principal players always sit closest to the audience.\n\nThe cellos are a critical part of orchestral music; all symphonic works involve the cello section, and many pieces require cello soli or solos. Much of the time, cellos provide part of the low-register harmony for the orchestra. Often, the cello section plays the melody for a brief period, before returning to the harmony role. There are also cello concertos, which are orchestral pieces that feature a solo cellist accompanied by an entire orchestra.\n\nThere are numerous cello concertos – where a solo cello is accompanied by an orchestra – notably 25 by Vivaldi, 12 by Boccherini, at least 3 by Haydn, 3 by C. P. E. Bach, 2 by Saint-Saëns, 2 by Dvořák, and one each by Robert Schumann], Lalo, and Elgar. There were also some cellists who, while not otherwise composers, did write cello-specific repertoire, such as Nikolaus Kraft who wrote six cello concertos. Beethoven's Triple Concerto for Cello, Violin and Piano and Brahms' Double Concerto for Cello and Violin are also part of the concertante repertoire although in both cases the cello shares solo duties with at least one other instrument. Moreover, several composers wrote large-scale pieces for cello and orchestra, which are concertos in all but name. Some familiar \"concertos\" are Richard Strauss' tone poem \"Don Quixote\", Tchaikovsky's \"Variations on a Rococo Theme\", Bloch's \"Schelomo\" and Bruch's \"Kol Nidrei\".\n\nIn the 20th century, the cello repertoire grew immensely. This was partly due to the influence of virtuoso cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who inspired, commissioned and premiered dozens of new works. Among these, Prokofiev's \"Symphony-Concerto\", Britten's \"Cello Symphony\", the concertos of Shostakovich and Lutosławski as well as Dutilleux's \"Tout un monde lointain...\" have already become part of the standard repertoire. Other major composers who wrote concertante works for him include Messiaen, Jolivet, Berio and Penderecki. In addition, Arnold, Barber, Glass, Hindemith, Honegger, Ligeti, Myaskovsky, Penderecki, Rodrigo, Villa-Lobos and Walton also wrote major concertos for other cellists, notably for Gaspar Cassadó, Aldo Parisot, Gregor Piatigorsky, Siegfried Palm and Julian Lloyd Webber.\n\nThere are also many sonatas for cello and piano. Those written by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Brahms, Grieg, Rachmaninoff, Debussy, Fauré, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Poulenc, Carter, and Britten are particularly well known.\n\nOther important pieces for cello and piano include Schumann's five \"Stücke im Volkston\" and transcriptions like Schubert's Arpeggione Sonata (originally for arpeggione and piano), César Franck's Cello Sonata (originally a violin sonata, transcribed by Jules Delsart with the composer's approval), Stravinsky's \"Suite italienne\" (transcribed by the composer – with Gregor Piatigorsky – from his ballet \"Pulcinella\") and Bartók's first rhapsody (also transcribed by the composer, originally for violin and piano).\n\nThere are pieces for cello solo, J. S. Bach's six Suites for Cello (which are among the best-known solo cello pieces), Kodály's Sonata for Solo Cello and Britten's three Cello Suites. Other notable examples include Hindemith's and Ysaÿe's Sonatas for Solo Cello, Dutilleux's \"Trois Strophes sur le Nom de Sacher\", Berio's \"Les Mots Sont Allés\", Cassadó's Suite for Solo Cello, Ligeti's Solo Sonata, Carter's two \"Figment\"s and Xenakis' \"Nomos Alpha\" and \"Kottos\".\n\nThe cello is a member of the traditional string quartet as well as string quintets, sextet or trios and other mixed ensembles.\nThere are also pieces written for two, three, four or more cellos; this type of ensemble is also called a \"cello choir\" and its sound is familiar from the introduction to Rossini's William Tell Overture as well as Zaccharia's prayer scene in Verdi's Nabucco. Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture also starts with a cello ensemble, with four cellos playing the top lines and two violas playing the bass lines. As a self-sufficient ensemble, its most famous repertoire is Villa-Lobos' first of his Bachianas Brasileiras for cello ensemble (the fifth is for soprano and 8 cellos). Other examples are Offenbach's cello duets, quartet, and sextet, Pärt's Fratres for 8 cellos and Boulez' \"Messagesquisse\" for 7 cellos, or even Villa-Lobos' rarely played \"Fantasia Concertante\" (1958) for 32 cellos. The 12 cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (or \"the Twelve\" as they have since taken to being called) specialize in this repertoire and have commissioned many works, including arrangements of well-known popular songs.\n\nThe cello is less common in popular music than in classical music. Several bands feature a cello in their standard line-up, e.g. Joe Kwon of The Avett Brothers. The more common use in pop and rock is to bring the instrument in for a particular song. In the 1960s, artists such as the Beatles and Cher used the cello in popular music, in songs such as The Beatles' \"Yesterday\", \"Eleanor Rigby\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", and Cher's \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\". \"Good Vibrations\" by the Beach Boys includes the cello in its instrumental ensemble, which includes a number of instruments unusual for this sort of music. Bass guitarist Jack Bruce, who had originally studied music on a performance scholarship for cello, played a prominent cello part in \"As You Said\" on Cream's \"Wheels of Fire\" studio album (1968).\n\nIn the 1970s, the Electric Light Orchestra enjoyed great commercial success taking inspiration from so-called \"Beatlesque\" arrangements, adding the cello (and violin) to the standard rock combo line-up and in 1978 the UK based rock band, Colosseum II, collaborated with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber on the recording \"Variations\". Most notably, Pink Floyd included a cello solo in their 1970 epic instrumental \"Atom Heart Mother\". Bass guitarist Mike Rutherford of Genesis was originally a cellist and included some cello parts in their \"Foxtrot\" album.\n\nEstablished non-traditional cello groups include Apocalyptica, a group of Finnish cellists best known for their versions of Metallica songs, Rasputina, a group of cellists committed to an intricate cello style intermingled with Gothic music, the Massive Violins, an ensemble of seven singing cellists known for their arrangements of rock, pop and classical hits, Von Cello, a cello fronted rock power trio, Break of Reality who mix elements of classical music with the more modern rock and metal genre, Cello Fury, a cello rock band that performs original rock/classical crossover music, and Jelloslave, a Minneapolis-based Cello duo with two percussionists. These groups are examples of a style that has become known as cello rock. The crossover string quartet bond also includes a cellist. Silenzium and Cellissimo Quartet are Russian (Novosibirsk) groups playing rock and metal and having more and more popularity in Siberia. Cold Fairyland from Shanghai, China is using a cello along a Pipa as the main solo instrument to create East meets West progressive (folk) rock.\n\nMore recent bands using the cello are Aerosmith, The Auteurs, Nirvana, Oasis, Smashing Pumpkins, James, Talk Talk, Phillip Phillips, OneRepublic, and the baroque rock band Arcade Fire. An Atlanta-based trio, King Richard's Sunday Best, also uses a cellist in their lineup. So-called \"chamber pop\" artists like Kronos Quartet, The Vitamin String Quartet and Margot and the Nuclear So and So's have also recently made cello common in modern alternative rock. Heavy metal band System of a Down has also made use of the cello's rich sound. The indie rock band The Stiletto Formal are known for using a cello as a major staple of their sound, similarly, the indie rock band Canada employs two cello players in their lineup. The orch-rock group, The Polyphonic Spree, which has pioneered the use of stringed and symphonic instruments, employs the cello in very creative ways for many of their \"psychedelic-esque\" melodies. The first wave screamo band \"I Would Set Myself On Fire For You\" featured a cello as well as a viola to create a more folk-oriented sound. The band, Panic! at the Disco uses a cello in their song, \"Build God, Then We'll Talk\". The lead vocalist of the band, Brendon Urie, also did the recording of the cello solo. The Lumineers added cellist Nela Pekarek to the band in 2010. She plays cello, sings harmony and duets.\n\nIn jazz, bassists Oscar Pettiford and Harry Babasin were among the first to use the cello as a solo instrument; both tuned their instrument in fourths, an octave above the double bass. Fred Katz (who was not a bassist) was one of the first notable jazz cellists to use the instrument's standard tuning and arco technique. Contemporary jazz cellists include Abdul Wadud, Diedre Murray, Ron Carter, Dave Holland, David Darling, Lucio Amanti, Akua Dixon, Ernst Reijseger, Fred Lonberg-Holm, Tom Cora and Erik Friedlander. Modern musical theatre pieces like Jason Robert Brown's The Last Five Years, Duncan Sheik's Spring Awakening, Adam Guettel's Floyd Collins, and Ricky Ian Gordon's My Life with Albertine use small string ensembles (including solo cellos) to a prominent extent.\n\nIn Indian Classical music Saskia Rao-de Haas is a well established soloist as well as playing duets with her sitarist husband Pt. Shubhendra Rao. Other cellists performing Indian classical music are: Nancy Lesh (Dhrupad) and Anup Biswas. Both Rao and Lesh play the cello sitting cross-legged on the floor.\n\nThe cello can also be used in bluegrass and folk music, with notable players including Ben Sollee of the Sparrow Quartet and the \"Cajun cellist\" Sean Grissom, as well as Vyvienne Long who, in addition to her own projects, has played for those of Damien Rice. Cellists such as Natalie Haas, Abby Newton and Liz Davis Maxfield have contributed significantly to the use of cello playing in Celtic folk music, often with the cello featured as a primary melodic instrument and employing the skills and techniques of traditional fiddle playing. Lindsay Mac is becoming well known for playing the cello like a guitar, with her cover of The Beatles' \"Blackbird\".\n\nThe cello is typically made from carved wood, although other materials such as carbon fiber or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a spruce top, with maple for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as poplar or willow, are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of laminated wood. Laminated cellos are widely used in elementary and secondary school orchestras and youth orchestras, because they are much more durable than carved wood cellos (i.e., they are less likely to crack if bumped or dropped) and they are much less expensive.\n\nThe top and back are traditionally hand-carved, though less expensive cellos are often machine-produced. The sides, or ribs, are made by heating the wood and bending it around forms. The cello body has a wide top bout, narrow middle formed by two C-bouts, and wide bottom bout, with the bridge and F holes just below the middle. The top and back of the cello has decorative border inlay known as purfling. While purfling is attractive, it is also functional: if the instrument is struck, the purfling can prevent cracking of the wood. A crack may form at the rim of the instrument, but spreads no further. Without purfling, cracks can spread up or down the top or back. Playing, traveling and the weather all affect the cello and can increase a crack if purfling is not in place. Less expensive instruments typically have painted purfling.\n\nCello manufacturer Luis & Clark constructs cellos from carbon fibre. Carbon fibre instruments are particularly suitable for outdoor playing because of the strength of the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Luis & Clark has produced over 1000 cellos, some of which are owned by cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma and Josephine van Lier. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an unknown number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum double basses and violins).\n\nAbove the main body is the carved neck. The neck has a curved cross-section on its underside, which is where the player's thumb runs along the neck during playing. The neck which leads to a pegbox and the scroll. The neck, pegbox, and scroll are normally carved out of a single piece of wood, usually maple. The fingerboard is glued to the neck and extends over the body of the instrument. The fingerboard is given a curved shape, matching the curve on the bridge. Both the fingerboard and bridge need to be curved so that the performer can bow individual strings. If the cello were to have a flat fingerboard and bridge, as with a typical guitar, the performer would only be able to bow the \"outer\" two strings or bow all the strings. The performer would not be able to play the \"inner\" two strings alone.\n\nThe nut is a raised piece of wood, fitted where the fingerboard meets the pegbox, in which the strings rest in shallow slots or grooves to keep them the correct distance apart. The pegbox houses four tapered tuning pegs, one for each string. The pegs are used to tune the cello by either tightening or loosening the string. The pegs are called \"friction pegs\", because they maintain their position by friction. The scroll is a traditional ornamental part of the cello and a feature of all other members of the violin family. Ebony is usually used for the tuning pegs, fingerboard, and nut, but other hardwoods, such as boxwood or rosewood, can be used. Black fittings on low-cost instruments are often made from inexpensive wood that has been blackened or \"ebonized\" to look like ebony, which is much harder and more expensive. Ebonised parts such as tuning pegs may crack or split, and the black surface of the fingerboard will eventually wear down to reveal the lighter wood underneath.\n\nHistorically, cello strings had cores made out of catgut, which, despite its name is made from sheep or goat intestines which are dried out. Most modern strings used in the 2010s are wound with metallic materials like aluminum, titanium and chromium. Cellists may mix different types of strings on their instruments. The pitches of the open strings are C, G, D, and A (black note heads in the playing range figure above), unless alternative tuning (scordatura) is specified by the composer. Some composers (e.g. Ottorino Respighi in the final movement of ‘’The Pines of Rome’’) ask that the low C be tuned down to a B or B so that the performer can play a different low note on the lowest open string.\n\nThe tailpiece and endpin are found in the lower part of the cello. The tailpiece is the part of the cello to which the \"ball ends\" of the strings are attached by passing them through holes. The tailpiece is attached to the bottom of the cello. The tailpiece is traditionally made of ebony or another hard wood, but can also be made of plastic or steel on lower-cost instruments. It attaches the strings to the lower end of the cello, and can have one or more fine tuners. The fine tuners are used to make smaller adjustments to the pitch of the string. The fine tuners can increase the tension of each string (raising the pitch) or decrease the tension of the string (lowering the pitch). When the performer is putting on a new string, the fine tuner for that string is normally reset to a middle position, and then the peg is turned to bring the string up to pitch. The fine turners are used for subtle, minor adjustments to pitch, such as tuning a cello to the oboe's 440 Hz A note or to tune the cello to a piano.\n\nThe endpin or spike is made of wood, metal or rigid carbon fibre and supports the cello in playing position. The endpin can be retracted into the hollow body of the instrument when the cello is being transported in its case. This makes the cello easier to move about. When the performer wishes to play the cello, the endpin is pulled out to lengthen it. The endpin is locked into the player's preferred length with a screw mechanism. The adjustable nature of endpins enables performers of different ages and body sizes to adjust the endpin length to suit them. In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves, as there was no endpin at that time. The endpin was \"introduced by Adrien Servais 1845 to give the instrument greater stability\". Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word \"endpin\" sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called \"tailpin\".) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor. Many cellists use a rubber pad with a metal cup to keep the tip from slipping on the floor. A number of accessories to keep the endpin from slipping; these include ropes which attach to the chair leg and other devices.\n\nThe bridge holds the strings above the cello and transfers their vibrations to the top of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The bridge is usually positioned by the cross point of the \"f-hole\" (i.e., where the horizontal line occurs in the \"f\"). The f-holes, named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process. They probably actually stand for an old style medial S, for words related to Sound. The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small length of rubber hose containing a water-soaked sponge, called a Dampit, is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier. This keeps the wood components of the cello from drying out.\n\nInternally, the cello has two important features: a bass bar, which is glued to the underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden sound post, a solid wooden cylinder which is wedged between the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations from the strings to the body of the instrument. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of the instrument (and to a lesser extent the back), acting as a diaphragm to produce the instrument's sound.\n\nCellos are constructed and repaired using hide glue, which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs call for the removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it lets go, so the plate does not crack. Cellists repairing cracks in their cello do not use regular wood glue, because it cannot be steamed open when a repair has to be made by a luthier.\n\nTraditionally, bows are made from pernambuco or brazilwood. Both come from the same species of tree (\"Caesalpinia echinata\"), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. Horsehair is stretched out between the two ends of the bow. The taut horsehair is drawn over the strings to produce the cello's characteristic tone. A small knob is twisted to increase or decrease the tension of the horsehair. The tension on the bow is released when the instrument is not being used. The amount of tension a cellist puts on the bow hair depends on the preferences of the player, the style of music being played, and for students, the preferences of their teacher.\n\nBows are also made from other materials, such as carbon-fibre—stronger than wood—and fiberglass (often used to make inexpensive, lower-quality student bows). An average cello bow is long (shorter than a violin or viola bow) high (from the frog to the stick) and wide. The frog of a cello bow typically has a rounded corner like that of a viola bow, but is wider. A cello bow is roughly heavier than a viola bow, which in turn is roughly heavier than a violin bow. \n\nBow hair is traditionally horsehair, though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back, and increase the tension of the hair. Rosin is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically. Baroque style (1600–1750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn gives off a louder sound.\n\nThe cello bow has also been used to play electric guitars. Jimmy Page pioneered its application on tracks such as \"Dazed and Confused\". The post-rock Icelandic band Sigur Rós's lead singer often plays a guitar using a cello bow.\n\nIn 1989, the German cellist Michael Bach began developing a curved bow, encouraged by John Cage, Dieter Schnebel, Mstislav Rostropovich and Luigi Colani: and since then many pieces have been composed especially for it. This curved bow (\"BACH.Bow\") is a convex curved bow which, unlike the ordinary bow, renders possible polyphonic playing on the various strings of the instrument. The solo repertoire for violin and cello by J. S. Bach the BACH.Bow is particularly suited to it: and it was developed with this in mind, polyphonic playing being required, as well as monophonic.\n\nWhen a string is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves the air around it, producing sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a hollow body, the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes the character of the sound produced. A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length and the net forces it experiences during a distortion. A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension of its strings, by turning the tuning pegs mounted on its pegbox, and tension adjusters (fine tuners) on the tail piece.\n\nA string’s length also affects its fundamental pitch. Shortening a string stiffens it by increasing its curvature during a distortion and subjecting it to larger net forces. Shortening the string also reduces its mass, but does not alter the mass per unit length, and it is the latter ratio rather than the total mass which governs the frequency. The string vibrates in a standing wave whose speed of propagation is given by , where \"T\" is the tension and \"m\" is the mass per unit length; there is a node at either end of the vibrating length, and thus the vibrating length \"l\" is half a wavelength. Since the frequency of any wave is equal to the speed divided by the wavelength, we have frequency = . (Note that some writers, including Muncaster (cited below) use the Greek letter \"μ\" in place of \"m\".) Thus shortening a string increases the frequency, and thus the pitch. Because of this effect, you can raise and change the pitch of a string by pressing it against the fingerboard in the cello’s neck and effectively shortening it. Likewise strings with less mass per unit length, if under the same tension, will have a higher frequency and thus higher pitch than more massive strings. This is a prime reason why the different strings on all string instruments have different fundamental pitches, with the lightest strings having the highest pitches.\n\nA played note of E or F has a frequency which is often very close to the natural resonating frequency of the body of the instrument, and if the problem is not addressed this can set the body into near resonance. This may cause an unpleasant sudden amplification of this pitch, and additionally a loud beating sound results from the interference produced between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the “wolf tone” because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello front plate, attaching a wolf eliminator (a metal cylinder or a rubber cylinder encased in metal), or moving the sound post.\nWhen a string is bowed or plucked to produce a note, the fundamental note is accompanied by higher frequency overtones. Each sound has a particular recipe of frequencies that combine to make the total sound.\n\nPlaying the cello is done while seated with the instrument supported on the floor by the endpin. The left hand fingertips stop the strings on the fingerboard, determining the pitch of the fingered note. The right hand plucks or bows the strings to sound the notes. The left hand fingertips stop the strings along their length, determining the pitch of each fingered note. Stopping the string closer to the bridge results in higher-pitched sound, because the vibrating string length has been shortened. In the \"neck\" positions (which use just less than half of the fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in \"thumb position\" (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.\n\nVibrato is a small oscillation in the pitch of a note, usually considered expressive. Harmonics played on the cello fall into two classes; natural and artificial. Natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching (but not depressing) the string with the finger at certain places, and then bowing (or, rarely, plucking) the string. For example, the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered (open) string. Natural harmonics only produce notes that are part of the harmonic series on a particular string. Artificial harmonics (also called false harmonics or stopped harmonics), in which the player depresses the string fully with one finger while touching the same string lightly with another finger, can produce any note above middle C. \nGlissando (Italian for \"sliding\") is an effect played by sliding the finger up or down the fingerboard without releasing the string. This causes the pitch to rise and fall smoothly, without separate, discernible steps.\n\nIn cello playing, the bow is much like the breath of a wind instrument player. Arguably, it is the major determinant in the expressiveness of the playing. The right hand holds the bow and controls the duration and character of the notes. The bow is drawn across the strings roughly halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge, in a direction perpendicular to the strings. The bow is held with all five fingers of the right hand, the thumb opposite the fingers and closer to the cellist's body. Tone production and volume of sound depend on a combination of several factors. The three most important ones are: bow speed, weight applied to the string, and point of contact of the bow hair with the string.\n\nDouble stops involve the playing of two notes at the same time. Two strings are fingered simultaneously, and the bow is drawn so as to sound them both at once. In pizzicato playing, the string is plucked directly with the fingers or thumb. Pizzicato is often abbreviated as \"Pizz.\". Position of the hand is slightly over the finger board and away from the bridge.\n\nA player using the col legno technique strikes or rubs the strings with the wood of the bow rather than the hair. In spiccato playing, the strings are not \"drawn\" by the bow hair but struck by it, while still retaining some horizontal motion, to generate a more percussive, crisp sound. In staccato, the player moves the bow a small distance and stops it on the string, making a short sound, the rest of the written duration being taken up by silence. \nLegato is a technique where the notes are smoothly connected without accents or breaks. It is noted by a slur (curved line) above or below – depending on their position on the staff – the notes of the passage that is to be played legato.\n\n\"Sul ponticello\" (\"on the bridge\") refers to bowing closer to the bridge, while \"sul tasto\" (\"on the fingerboard\") calls for bowing nearer the end of the fingerboard. Sul tasto produces a more flute-like sound, with more emphasis on the fundamental frequency of the note, and softer overtones.\n\nStandard-sized cellos are referred to as \"full-size\" or \"\" but are also made in smaller (fractional) sizes (e.g. , , , , , , ). The fractions refer to volume rather than length, so a 1/2 size cello is much longer than half the length of a full size. The smaller cellos are identical to standard cellos in construction, range, and usage, but are simply scaled-down for the benefit of children and shorter adults.\n\nCellos in sizes larger than do exist, and cellists with unusually large hands may require such a non-standard instrument. Cellos made before approximately 1700 tended to be considerably larger than those made and commonly played today. Around 1680, changes in string-making technology made it possible to play lower-pitched notes on shorter strings. The cellos of Stradivari, for example, can be clearly divided into two models: the style made before 1702, characterized by larger instruments (of which only three exist in their original size and configuration), and the style made during and after 1707, when Stradivari began making smaller cellos. This later model is the design most commonly used by modern luthiers. The scale length of a cello is about . The new size offered fuller tonal projection and greater range of expression. The instrument in this form was able to contribute to more pieces musically and offered the possibility of greater physical dexterity for the player to develop technique.\n\nThere are many accessories for the cello.\n\n\n\nCellos are made by luthiers, specialists in building and repairing stringed instruments, ranging from guitars to violins. The following luthiers are notable for the cellos they have produced:\n\nA person who plays the cello is called a \"cellist\". For a list of notable cellists, see the list of cellists and .\n\nCareers in cello vary widely by genre and by region or country. Most cellists earn their living from a mixture of performance and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance jobs is by playing at an audition. In some styles of music, cellists may be asked to sight read printed music or perform standard repertoire with an ensemble.\n\nIn classical music, cellists audition for playing jobs in orchestras and for admission into university or Conservatory programs or degrees. At a classical cello audition, the performer typically plays a movement from a Bach suite or a movement from a concerto and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the conductor, the Concertmaster, the Principal cellist and other principal players.\n\nThe most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a \"test week\", in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.\n\nPerformance jobs include playing as a freelancer in small groups, playing in a chamber music group, large ensembles, or performing solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting (\"subbing\") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players to be able to find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can come to this is in the case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.\n\nTeaching work for cellists includes giving private lessons in the home or at colleges and universities; coaching cellists who are preparing for recordings or auditions; doing group coaching at music camps or for youth ensembles; and working as a high school music teacher. Due to the limited number of full-time orchestral jobs, many classical cellists are not able to find full-time work with a single orchestra. Some cellists increase their employ-ability by learning several different styles, such as folk or pop.\n\nIn some cases, cellists supplement their performing and teaching income with other related music jobs, such as working as a stringed instrument repairer (luthier); as a contractor who hires musicians for orchestras or big bands, composing music, songwriting, conducting, or organizing festivals (e.g., Julian Armour).\n\nSpecific instruments are famous (or become famous) for a variety of reasons. An instrument's notability may arise from its age, the fame of its maker, its physical appearance, its acoustic properties, and its use by notable performers. The most famous instruments are generally known for all of these things. The most highly prized instruments are now collector's items, and are priced beyond the reach of most musicians. These instruments are typically owned by some kind of organization or investment group, which may loan the instrument to a notable performer. (For example, the Davidov Stradivarius, which is currently in the possession of one of the most widely known living cellists, Yo-Yo Ma, is actually owned by the Vuitton Foundation.)\n\nSome notable cellos:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bakhtin analysed François Rabelais' book \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\" and its portrayals of \"grotesque realism\" (i.e. celebrations of primary needs) and carnival in which social norms were subverted.\n\nThe Culture of Popular Laughter combines two literary ideas developed by Bakhtin in the same work: the idea of \"Grotesque body\" and \"Carnivalesque\" debauchery. It is distinguished from each, however, by its applications outside literary theory.\n\nThe idea of \"Carnivalesque\" was also created by Bakhtin and forms part of his wider theory of Popular Laughter. He argued that, during times of carnival such as the Feast of Fools, social norms were deliberately turned upside-down. The carnival then became a form of Safety-valve institution, which served a Structural-functionalist role to temporarily release stresses in the contemporary social system. Bakhtin, however, argued that this form of system was \"formalized\" in the culture of the period as \"popular laughter\".\n\nThe historian Gábor Klaniczay argued that the Culture of Popular Laughter stretched through all echelons of society and was certainly not restricted to the peasantry. Bakhtin's theory has also been credited with bringing about a scholarly reassessement of the importance of popular culture in history.\n\nThe Culture of Popular Laughter was originally formulated based on the writings of Rabelais, but has also been applied in the interpretation of peasant scenes painted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and his descendants. The example has also been applied to Japanese society.\n"}

The academy, run by Master Lin, is composed of children of mob bosses and mass murderers, learning the same trade as their parents.\n\nMarcus's decision to attend the school is one of the only decisions he gets to make for himself throughout the arc and history. His entire life has been composed of unfortunate events, each leaving him further ostracized from humanity. Marcus's lack of residence is primarily due to both of his parents dying in a horrible accident when he was young. This resulted in Marcus being placed into an orphanage, in which the head of the house required his manual labor for him to retain residence. This continued degradation of his sanity through the abuse by the hands of his roommates and guardians eventually drives him to committing a massive act of violence.\n\n\"Deadly Class\" then continues to follow the stories of the individuals enrolled in the academy and many of their eventual downfalls.\n\nMain characters \n\n\nDirectors Anthony and Joe Russo have signed on to produce a television series based on \"Deadly Class\". The Sony Pictures Television-produced adaptation has been optioned as a pilot for the Syfy channel. Benedict Wong, Benjamin Wadsworth, Lana Condor, Michel Duval and María Gabriela de Faría are among the actors cast in main roles for the series. On April 18, 2018, Syfy picked up the pilot to series. The first episode will air on the 16 January on SyFy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4458932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4458932", "title": "Elgato", "text": "Elgato\n\nElgato is a brand of consumer technology products. The manufacturer, also called Elgato, was founded in 1992 by Markus Fest and is headquartered in Munich, Germany.\n\nElgato is best known for a line of video-recording products called EyeTV, which record video from over-the-air antennas, satellite TV, or mobile devices. The first EyeTV product was introduced in November 2002.\n\nMore recently, Elgato introduced a line of \"smart\" products, such as a key fob that tracks the user's distance from their car or purse and provides notifications to help them find it. In 2014, it introduced a home monitoring system called Eve, which provides alerts to users regarding things like air pressure, temperature and water use. Elgato also developed light bulbs that can respond to programming on a mobile device and respond to commands over Bluetooth and it produces two Thunderbolt products: a dock for MacBooks and an external hard drive. In May 2018, Elgato introduced Eve Aqua a HomeKit smart water controller.\n\nOn June 28th, 2018, Corsair Components acquired the gaming departments of Elgato, while Elgato's smart home team remains their own company and spun off as Eve Systems.\n\nThe first EyeTV hardware device was introduced in November 2002. It was a small USB-powered device that contained a cable tuner and hardware encoder in order to convert television video into an MPEG-1 format for watching on a computer. It also had coaxial and RCA plugs to connect it with a VCR or camcorder. A 2002 article in Macworld said it was the \"first step\" in bridging computers and television, but at this point still had \"some kinks\".\n\nThe next iteration was released in 2004 and called EyeTV 200. EyeTV 200 introduced a digital remote control and converted video programming into the higher-quality MPEG-2 format. A Macworld review gave it 4 out of 5 stars for \"very good\" and emphasized the video quality and ease-of-use. A story in the \"Washington Post\" said it was more expensive than some alternatives, but worked on a Mac and had good-quality recordings. Also in 2004 the first EyeTV product for satellite television was introduced with the EyeTV 310, which was later discontinued and replaced with EyeTV Sat.\n\nThat same year a home media server called EyeHome was introduced. It had recording features similar to other EyeTV products, but was also intended for streaming a computer display to a television. It connected Mac computers and televisions that share the same home network. A review in Macworld gave it three stars or a \"good\" rating, saying that it was easy to install and worked well with Apple applications, but some aspects were quirky or frustrating. \"Sound and Vision Magazine\" said it was \"pretty darn cool\" and an easy, inexpensive way to get media server functionality, though there were some user interface quirks. It gave the product an 89 out of 100 rating.\n\nBy 2005, several other EyeTV products had been introduced, such as the EyeTV for DTT, the EyeTV EZ and the EyeTV Wonder. The EyeTV for DTT (digital terrestrial TV) is a small USB-powered device with an antenna for receiving free over-the-air television broadcasts. It received a 4 out of 5 rating in TechRadar. A review in \"The Register\" gave it an 85 percent rating. The Eye TV Wonder was only available from July 2005 to January 2006, before being discontinued and replaced with the Eye TV EZ. The EZ was a basic, entry-level product with an analog tuner for watching TV on a Mac computer.\n\nIn 2006, version 2.1 of the EyeTV software was introduced with a new user-interface, an integrated TV guide from TitanTV and compatibility with Apple remotes. The interface was similar to that of other Apple products. An article in Macworld praised the update and especially the new editing features, but said it had some quirks, such as a difficult-to-find Edit button. Some of the iHome software, which plays video content from a computer onto a television, was released in 2006 as a universal binary.\n\nVersion 2.4 of the EyeTV software was released in 2007 and added an export tool for Apple TV.\n\nAs of February 2015, Elgato no longer sells ATSC tuners. (ATSC is the digital television standard used in the United States, Canada, South Korea, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.) The Elgato web site explicitly declines to give a reason: \"Elgato Technical Support is not able to comment on this business decision.\"\n\nIn February 2016, Elgato sells the EyeTV business to Geniatech Europe GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shenzhen Geniatech Inc., Ltd. Geniatech will take over the complete EyeTV product line. This company no longer sells the Turbo.264 HD software and reduced digital TV tuners to one model. No news about Thunderbolt products continuity.\n\nThe EyeTV Diversity is a USB-powered device with dual tuners for receiving over the air television broadcasts. The tuners can be used simultaneously for an optimized signal, or one tuner can be used to record a channel, while another is used to watch a separate show. Diversity was first introduced in November 2006. A driver in 2009 added compatibility with Windows 7. A review in TechRadar gave EyeTV Diversity five out of five stars. PC Advisor and Pocket-Lint both gave it four out of five stars.\n\nEyeTV Hybrid, which can pick up digital or analog television broadcasts, was first released in early 2009. A CNET review said the device was easy and effective to use, but that buffering was often too slow to make watching live TV practical. Macworld said EyeTV's \"core strength\" was recording scheduled TV shows. A review in \"PC Magazine\" gave the product 3.5 out of 5 stars. The review said it \"works exceptionally well\" but doesn't come with Windows software.\n\nIn June 2010, the EyeTV HD product for recording high-definition cable and satellite programming was introduced. Because cable and satellite signals are encoded, the device must be connected to a tuner from a television provider. Then it provides remote controls, recording and DVR-functionality from a connected computer. A Macworld review gave the product four out of five stars. A review in \"Laptop Magazine\" gave EyeTV HD 3.5 out of 5 stars. It said the interface was intuitive and the video quality was good, but noted it was only compatible with Macs.\n\nThe EyeTV Netstream 4Sat has four satellite tuners, allowing four channels to be watched simultaneously from different devices. It was introduced in 2014. A review in Macworld gave it 5 out of 5 stars. The review said Elgato had addressed some of the limitations of prior EyeTV satellite tuners like Netstream Sat/DTT. Pocket-Lint gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars CNET gave it five stars. The EyeTV Sat product, which receives free-to-air television, was introduced in Europe in late 2009. \"The Register\" gave it an 80% rating, saying that it \"works well\" and that the documentation did not make it clear how to install the Apple and Windows versions of the software.\n\nThe EyeTV software was updated to version 3.0 in 2008. 3.0 made user interface improvements, such as being able to mark favorites or automatically record shows in a series. A review in TechRadar gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars. The review noted that EyeTV was the de facto software for TV and computer video integration and praised its new features, but said it was expensive when purchased separately. A 2007 article in \"MacLife\" said their \"top picks\" for USB-powered tuners were those using the EyeTV software, such as the EyeTV hybrid or EyeTV 250. In addition to Elgato's EyeTV line of consumer devices, other brands such as Terratec and Miglia use the EyeTV software in their products through licensing agreements with Elgato.\n\nThe EyeTV W was introduced in November 2013. It is a small 44 gram device that receives free digital over-the-air television broadcasts and makes it available to portable devices through a wireless hot spot. A review in Macworld said it was portable, easy to use and had good battery life, but noted that users can't connect to other wi-fi networks and watch TV at the same time. It gave the product 4 out of 5 stars. An EyeTV Mobile device for iPads was announced at the 2011 International Franchise Conference as the first tuner for the new Freeview system in the United Kingdom.\n\nSubsequently the EyeTV Mobile and EyeTV Micro products were released for iPhones and Android respectively. The Micro and Mobile allow users to watch or record free over-the-air television programming from their smartphone. Reviews of the mobile products ranged from 2 out of 5 stars by CNET 4 out of 5 stars in Macworld and 3 out of 5 stars in \"PC Magazine\". There is also an EyeTV iPhone app that allows the user to watch their recorded shows on their iPhone, control their EyeTV recordings or watch live TV while connected to Wi-Fi. A compact version for laptops, the EyeTV GO, was introduced in May 2014.\n\nElgato manufactures and markets a smart-key system. The system comes with a small 10-gram device that is placed on a key ring, in a purse, inside a car, or somewhere else. Then it communicates with an Elgato app on an iOS device. If it is set up for keys, the app will alert the user when they are 10 meters away from their keys, indicating that they may have forgotten them. It takes advantage of the \"Smart Bluetooth\" Apple implemented in iOS 7. A review in TheNextWeb said it was \"money well spent\" and worked \"exactly as described\", but that the beeping of the device could be louder and users will still need to supplement it with the Find my Phone app. A review in Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nIn September 2014, Elgato announced a home monitoring system called Eve, which monitors a home's air pressure, water usage, temperature, air quality and other factors. Elgato said the product won't be available until the HomeKit software, which is expected to come with Apple iOS 8, is released. It also introduced smart light bulbs, which communicate with iOS devices through Bluetooth and allow users to adjust home lighting from their mobile device.\n\nIn late 2014, Elgato introduced the Smart Power battery backup for mobile devices. It communicates with the user's bluetooth-enabled device to provide notifications and calendar reminders when it needs to be charged.\n\nElgato introduced a Thunderbolt docking station in June 2014. A computer is plugged into the dock using a Thunderbolt port in order to gain access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in \"The Register\" said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. \"The Register\" and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nElgato introduced two firewire external hard drives in September 2012 called Thunderbolt Drive. Benchmark tests by MacWorld and Tom's Hardware said that the hard drive was slower than other products they tested, despite being connected through a faster Thunderbolt port, rather than Firewire. The following year, in 2013, Elgato replaced them with similar drives identified as \"Thunderbolt Drive +\", which added USB 3.0 support and was claimed to be faster than the previous iteration. A CNET review of a Thunderbolt Drive+ drive gave it a 4.5 out of 5 star rating. It said the drive was \"blazing fast\" and \"the most portable drive to date\" but was also expensive. An article in \"The Register\" explained that the original drives introduced in 2012 didn't perform well in benchmark tests, but the newer \"plus\" version had impressive speed results during testing.\n\nGame Capture HD, which connects to gaming consoles to record gameplay, was introduced in 2012. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording. The device connects between a gaming console and the TV and is powered by a USB connection. It captures video as the console sends it to the television, compresses and stores it. A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that it could also be used to record iPad games with the right setup.\n\nIn October 2014 Elgato released a new version called HD 60. It recorded in 60 frames per second and 1080p high definition video (compared to the previous Game Capture HD's 1080p30 or 720p60), whereas typical low-end video game recording devices capture in 720p and 30 frames per second. \"The Telegraph\" gave it four out of five stars. A review in Gizmodo said that it captured extremely high-quality footage, but it may be higher-end than needed for many gamers that would be satisfied with the recording features built into the console.\n\nIn June 2018, Corsair Components acquired Elgato Gaming. \n\n"}

{"id": "50776786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50776786", "title": "Face with Tears of Joy emoji", "text": "Face with Tears of Joy emoji\n\n😂, officially referred to as Face with Tears of Joy emoji—and also known as the LOL emoji, joy emoji, laughing emoji, laughing crying emoji, or the crying laughing emoji—is an emoji featuring a jovial face laughing, while also crying out tears. It can also be used for joking and teasing. It is one of the most commonly used emojis on social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\nThe creation and early development of emojis dates back to 1999 in Japan, and is attributed to Japanese telecommunications planner and then-NTT DoCoMo employee Shigetaka Kurita, who sketched illustrations after coming up with the idea of adding simple images to NTT DoCoMo's texting feature. When Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, there was an emoji keyboard intended for Japanese users only. However, after iPhone users in the United States discovered that downloading Japanese apps allowed access to the keyboard, pressure grew to expand availability of the emoji keyboard beyond Japan, and in 2011, Apple made it an iOS international standard. Global popularity of emojis then surged in the early to mid-2010s. \n\nWhat was officially called the \"Face with Tears of Joy\" emoji by the Unicode Consortium was introduced with the October 2010 release of Unicode 6.0. The Face with Tears of Joy emoji is in the Emoticons Unicode block under: . The cat variant under is also available.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, the emoji became mainstream; on June 5, 2014, \"FiveThirtyEight\" noted that the \"Face with Tears of Joy\" emoji (😂) was the second most used emoji on the Twitter platform, appearing in 278+ million tweets, only behind the \"Hearts\" emoji (♥️)'s 342+ million figure. Oxford University Press partnered with the mobile technology business SwiftKey to explore frequency and usage statistics for global popular emoji usage, detailing that in 2015, 😂 was chosen as Oxford Dictionaries' Word of the Year because it was the most used emoji, globally, in that respective year. In a blog post, Oxford Dictionaries expressed that the emoji \"was chosen as the 'word' that best reflected the ethos, mood, and preoccupations of 2015.\" SwiftKey further detailed that the emoji made up 20% of all the emojis used in the UK in 2015, and 17% of those in the US, up from 4% and 9% respectively, in 2014. Oxford Dictionaries president Caspar Grathwohl explained Oxford's choice, stating, \"emoji are becoming an increasingly rich form of communication, one that transcends linguistic borders.\" \n\nIn May 2015, Instagram Engineering posted a blog that highlighted Instagram user data, revealing that the emoji was the most popularly used on the Instagram platform. On December 7, 2015, the Twitter Data team tweeted out that the Face with Tears of Joy emoji was the most used on the Twitter platform during the year, with over 6.6 billion uses of it to that point. \n\nOn World Emoji Day 2017, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared the ten most used emojis on the Facebook platform; the Face with Tears of Joy emoji ranked #1 globally, as well as in United Kingdom. The emoji was also one of the top three most used globally on Facebook's Messenger app. Also during the observance, SwiftKey announced that the emoji was the most used in the United Kingdom during 2016. In 2017, \"Time\" reported that for the third consecutive year the emoji \"[reigned] supreme on social media\". \n\nTwitter users voted this as the most popular emoji \"of all time\" in 2017, granting it the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" in Emojipedia's annual \"World Emoji Awards\" announced on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange for World Emoji Day.\n\nIn November 2013, Brenden Gallagher of \"Complex\" ranked the \"Laughing Crying Face\" emoji at #2 in his \"Emoji Power Rankings\", writing that \"research courtesy of Complex Stats and Information indicates that the Laughing Crying Face has almost reached a point of complete saturation\". In response to Oxford's choice to make \"😂\" their word of the year in 2015, \"Slate\" staff writer Katy Waldman commented that \"😂 [is] the right linguistic incarnation of yet another complicated year, not to mention a good commentary on the very act of choosing a word of the year. What does it mean? Is it good or bad? It depends! With [the emoji's] intense and inscrutable emotional lability, [it] is less of a word and more of an invitation to invent some sort of meaning\".\n\nRegarding the reasoning behind the emoji's popularity, Fred Benenson, author of \"Emoji Dick\", commented that \"it is versatile. It can be used to convey joy, obviously, but also 'I'm laughing so hard I'm crying.' So you've got two basic, commonly occurring human emotions covered.\" Benenson also attributed the emoji's popularity to it being one of the better designed emojis from Apple. Abi Wilkinson, a freelance journalist writing for \"The Guardian\", opined that the Face with Tears of Joy emoji is \"the worst emoji of all\", describing it as an \"obnoxious, chortling little yellow dickhead [with] bulbous, cartoonish tears streaming down its face\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19623444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19623444", "title": "Financial betting", "text": "Financial betting\n\nFinancial betting refers to the wagering on the price development of a financial instrument at some later date relative to the current price or level of the instrument, against odds offered by a bookmaker. Maximum potential pay-off of the wager is known when the bet is taken and as a corollary risk is known beforehand by being limited to the initial stake.\n\nFinancial betting instruments are a type of digital option. The outcome of the wager at settlement is binary, that is, either a win or a loss. Settlement is executed in cash and there is no delivery of the underlying asset. At any point in time prior to the settlement date bets can often be sold, allowing for possibilities to bet on the accuracy of a market move within the fixed limits of zero win (loss of the stake) and maximum potential win. A fee might sometimes be charged for this service.\n\nThe main difference between financial betting and speculation on financial markets using products such as financial spread betting is that the bet must result in a simple binary win or loss based on an event on the underlying financial instruments. This triggers a fixed payout for a win, while with spread betting the payout or loss varies with the price level of the underlying instrument.\n\nOdds have to be consistent with the real-time pricing of the underlying financial instruments listed on foreign exchange markets or securities exchanges in order to avoid arbitrage opportunities (although this might not be possible because of limitations on shorting, i.e. laying bets). Calculation of the odds therefore draws on the Black–Scholes formula for pricing options. Using some variation of the model to solve for volatility, from observed market prices of traded options, gives implied volatility. Implied volatility is forward looking, that is, it can be used to estimate the odds for future price movements using mathematical algorithms.\n\nThere are three main variations of financial betting. These vary mainly in the way odds are displayed.\n\n\nWithin financial floating odds the odds change for a given strike price as the price of the underlying changes. The floating odds company calculates odds for different strikes and how much can be won upon settlement depends on how much is bet at those odds.\n\nWithin financial fixed odds betting the odds are fixed, while the strike price where a win is achieved relative the current level changes. The fixed odds company will calculate how much has to be bet to win a certain amount upon settlement if the conditions of the prediction become true.\n\nBinary betting displays odds as an index from 0 to 100 where the bet settles at 100 if the event happens and 0 if it does not. An amount is wagered per point on the index. The event can be bought or sold, making it possible to profit both from the event occurring or not occurring.\n\nA central feature of financial betting is the fixed risk nature which allows market participants to limit the risk to a known amount. When one opens a bet (long or short) they know beforehand what risk they are taking. What is important here is that you can exit your bet at any time before settlement thus you have an option of minimizing the risk even further. The same can be applied to the winning bets (you can collect the win before the settlement time).\n\nLiquidity is always provided and is achieved by the bookmaker acting as a market maker, always being willing to sell bets to a buyer, and in the case it is permitted, to buy bets back from a participant wanting to sell the bet before it expires. \n\nA central feature of financial betting is leverage. The benefit of leverage to the participant is that it allows a greater percentage change in capital than if it were invested directly in the underlying asset. This makes financial betting less capital intensive than trading directly on securities exchanges.\n\n\n"}

After a hiatus in fall 2008, the spin-off show was produced by Reckless Sidekick Productions. The \"Hero Envy\" franchise has been described as \"nerd parody.\" \n\n\"Hero Envy\" began as the script for an uncompleted short film written by Mike Hopta and Keith Gleason in 1997. The comedy featured 2 friends named J.D. and Wally who were on a quest to find meaning in their lives after they graduate from college. In 2005, Hopta and Gleason revamped the idea and wrote four scripts they produced as 10- to 35-minute live-action web videos. Glint of Hope Productions was formed and premiered the pilot episode \"Saturday Morning\" in August 2005. Episodes revolved around the misadventures of J.D. and Wally.

The final episode, \"Christmas Special 2009\", was released in December 2009.\n\nIn 2009, Reckless Sidekick Productions began publishing an ongoing video podcast series starring Gleason and Cimino in, generally, a roundtable discussion with guests covering a specific pop-culture topic each installment. The podcasts 15 to 30 minutes.\n\nIn April 2012, Reckless Sidekick Productions released the \"Hero Envy\" comic book. Written by Keith Gleason with added dialogue from Efrain Martinez and story assistance from John Cimino, the comic book is a three-part miniseries set in the universe established in the \"Hero Envy\" webisodes. A trade paperback compilation was released in April 2013. The story expands on the characters' backgrounds and follows them on a quest for four mystical objects that need to be used against villain El Moco-Conpan. The comic also adds an otherworldly character U-Toob, a parody of Marvel Comics' Uatu the Watcher. who guides the characters throughout the story. The comic includes a second story that explains the origin of El Diablo, an imaginary friend who lives in the character J.D.'s head.\n\nJ.D. Fields - Played by John Cimino\n\nThe rambunctious and raging hormone who sometimes doesn't know if he's 3 or 30 (and this usually happens at the expense of others)! Cares little for time, law and order, for those things mean nothing in \"J.D. World.\" Even though he's loath to admit it, J.D. needs his best friend Wally and this sometimes comes at a huge price. An incorrigible rebel that lives for babes, beers, cartoons, and chaos, and not necessarily in that order. In an alternate dimension J.D. lives with The Toy Dealer and seems to tolerate Dekker a little more than usual (even asking him to become a roommate). He likes to change his hats depending on the situations.\n\nDekker - Played by Keith Gleason\n\nWorks the counter for the local comic shop \"Fly on the Wall Comics.\" Dekker has been friends with Wally for over 10 years and they bonded over an issue of Hellboy. A loner who is a little \"off\" due to his militant love for blood, guts, and horror. Dekker is also up on all internet geek news because he is on ebay everyday and writing hate e-mails to studios for re-making his favorite horror movies. Recently, Dekker stole J.B.'s reality hopping razor for fun but now finds himself trapped in a parallel universe that he is trying to escape from.\n\nWallace North - Played by Mike Hopta\n\nThe level-headed, kind, yet sometimes gullible guy who looks for the best in everyone and in any situation. Think Charlie Brown trying to \"right the wrong\" like his hero Hal Jordan (Green Lantern) while maintaining his sanity in a world lost. Wally tries to live as normal of a life as possible by balancing a riled up J.D. and trying to \"get it right\" with his on and off again girlfriend Brooke. Known for his high-speed-joystick-trigger-fingers and an almost uncanny dedication to his comicbook heroes.\n\nOrson H. Cochrane - Played by Kurt Loether\n\nThe lovable, somewhat-robotic science fiction companion to Wally. Orson still lives at home with his mother (but he would contend it's the bridge of the USS \"Enterprise\"). Wally and Orson met in line waiting for \"Return of the Jedi\" tickets 20 years ago (oddly enough he still hasn't stopped complaining about the Ewoks). His extensive robotic Sci-fi techno babble can drive even the most balanced Jedi to the dark side. Orson's relationship with J.D. is a bit shakey because J.D. is very territorial when it comes to all things Wally.\n\n"}

There are many reasons for impersonating someone:\n\n\nCelebrity impersonators are entertainers who look similar to celebrities and dress in such a way as to imitate them. Impersonators are known as look-alikes, impressionists, imitators tribute artists and wannabees. The interest may have originated with the need or desire to see a celebrity who has died. One of the most prominent examples of this phenomenon is the case of Elvis Presley. There are claimed to be more Elvis impersonators and tribute artists in the world than for any other celebrity.\n\nEdward Moss has appeared in movies and sitcoms, impersonating Michael Jackson.\n\nTom Jones has attracted his share of impersonators from different places around the world. From the United States, to South East Asia, to the UK, there are performers who either sound like him or imitate his act.\n\n\nAlthough in a recent case, an immigrant was charged with \"criminal impersonation\" for using another person's social security number when signing up for a job, some courts have ruled that this is not an actual crime.

It was broadcast every season and gained popularity as . Through various games reverting to the origins of sports, professional players and general participants challenged the limits of physical strength and technique, winning prizes if all targets were successfully destroyed.\n\nKane Kosugi's Shaolin Temple training and 's Muay Thai bouts were also documented in the broadcasts. The popularity of the displays of amazing physical strength and technique by professional players and luck of general participants drove TV Asahi to move its anime time slot up one hour and caused the cancellation of on Fuji TV.\n\nThe use of the program's mascot, , originally only featured during the broadcast, expanded in 1999 into the program's opening sequence and every game's introduction. Simultaneously, a brandmark for the program, different from its logotype, was created: the English initials, \"MR\". However, that same autumn, only the mascot remained, and the \"MR\" brandmark vanished, having only appeared for that brief time.\n\nOn May 5, 2002, two show participants injured their cervical vertebrae during the filming of an episode entitled \"Chikarajima\" (\"Power Island\"), an obstacle course with a temple like setting stationed outside. The accidents occurred during the \"rock attack\" and \"rock valley\" obstacle portions.\n\nIn rock attack, contestants try to catch a giant ball that comes down a 15-degree slope, they must then push the ball back up the slope where a platform leads to the rock valley waterway. In rock valley, they try to walk on the ball, which weighs about 30 kg and has a diameter of 1.8 meters, across the aforementioned waterway 2.5 meters wide and 1.4 meters deep. Wei Tao, a 19-year-old Chinese freshman at Kyoto University, fell into the waterway during the rock valley obstacle. Takunori Isa, a 20-year-old junior at Tokai University, was knocked down when he tried to catch the ball in rock attack and was rolled over by the ball.\n\nIt would prove to be the final episode of \"Kinniku Banzuke\". Show production was officially put on hiatus, and the show was effectively cancelled. The dormant space was filled with a special edition of \"Count Down TV\", \"CDTV Gold\", entitled .

This is why there are different versions (I, II, III, IV, V) next to some names. Sometimes an obstacle is changed between attempts to conquer this game, so there are letters (A, B) next to the versions. This is most likely done because of the injuries caused by this obstacle. Some of these events have \"break zones\", where any competitor who reaches that point is allowed to take a 30-second break before they must continue on with the course.\n\n\"Struck Out\", \"Kick Target\", etc. – The contest for the 2 million yen prize consisted of many games that formed the \"2 Million Yen Dream Plan\".\n\n\n\n\nBREAK ZONE\nBREAK ZONE\nBREAK ZONE\n\nBREAK ZONE\nBREAK ZONE\nBREAK ZONE\n\nThis show was seen on America's G4 network under the name \"Unbeatable Banzuke\" with Rome Kanda from \"I Survived a Japanese Game Show\" (aka Kei Kato) as the host.

{"id": "317947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317947", "title": "Music journalism", "text": "Music journalism\n\nMusic journalism (or \"music criticism\") is media criticism and reporting about popular music topics, including pop music, rock music, and related styles. Journalists began writing about music in the eighteenth century, providing commentary on what is now thought of as classical music. In the 2000s, a more prominent branch of music journalism is an aspect of entertainment journalism, covering popular music and including profiles of singers and bands, live concert, and album reviews.\n\nMusic journalism has its roots in classical music criticism, which has traditionally comprised the study, discussion, evaluation, and interpretation of music that has been composed and notated in a score and the evaluation of the performance of classical songs and pieces, such as symphonies and concertos .\n\nBefore about the 1840s, reporting on music was either done by musical journals, such as \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\" (later the \"Neue Zeitschrift für Musik\"), founded by Robert Schumann, and in London journals such as \"The Musical Times\" (founded in 1844 as \"The Musical Times and Singing-class Circular\"); or else by reporters at general newspapers where music did not form part of the central objectives of the publication. An influential English 19th-century music critic, for example, was James William Davison of \"The Times.\" The composer Hector Berlioz also wrote reviews and criticisms for the Paris press of the 1830s and 1840s.\n\nModern art music journalism is often informed by music theory consideration of the many diverse elements of a musical piece or performance, including (as regards a musical composition) its form and style, and for performance, standards of technique and expression. These standards were expressed, for example, in journals such as \"Neue Zeitschrift für Musik\" founded by Robert Schumann, and are continued today in the columns of serious newspapers and journals such as \"The Musical Times\".\n\nSeveral factors—including growth of education, the influence of the Romantic movement generally and in music, popularization (including the 'star-status' of many performers such as Liszt and Paganini), among others—led to an increasing interest in music among non-specialist journals, and an increase in the number of critics by profession of varying degrees of competence and integrity. The 1840s could be considered a turning point, in that music critics after the 1840s generally were not also practicing musicians. However, counterexamples include Alfred Brendel, Charles Rosen, Paul Hindemith, and Ernst Krenek; all of whom were modern practitioners of the classical music tradition who also write (or wrote) on music.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a decline in the quantity of classical criticism began occurring \"when classical-music criticism visibly started to disappear\" from the media. At that time, magazines such as \"Time\" and \"Vanity Fair\" employed classical music critics, but by the early 1990s, classical critics were dropped in many magazines, in part due to \"a decline of interest in classical music, especially among younger people\".\n\nAlso of concern in classical music journalism was how American reviewers can write about ethnic and folk music from cultures other than their own, such as Indian ragas and traditional Japanese works. In 1990, the World Music Institute interviewed four \"New York Times\" music critics who came up with the following criteria on how to approach ethnic music:\n\n\nA key finding in a 2005 study of arts journalism in America was that the profile of the \"average classical music critic is a white, 52-year old male, with a graduate degree\". Demographics indicated that the group was 74% male, 92% white, and 64% had earned a graduate degree. One critic of the study pointed out that because all newspapers were included, including low-circulation regional papers, the female representation of 26% misrepresented the actual scarcity, in that the \"large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics\", with the notable exceptions of Anne Midgette in the \"New York Times\" and Wynne Delacoma in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\".\n\nIn 2007, \"The New York Times\" wrote that classical music criticism, which it characterized as \"a high-minded endeavor that has been around at least as long as newspapers\", had undergone \"a series of hits in recent months\" with the elimination, downgrading, or redefinition of critics' jobs at newspapers in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and elsewhere, citing \"New York\" magazine's Peter G. Davis, \"one of the most respected voices of the craft, [who] said he had been forced out after 26 years\". Viewing \"robust analysis, commentary and reportage as vital to the health of the art form\", \"The New York Times\" stated in 2007 that it continued to maintain \"a staff of three full-time classical music critics and three freelancers\", noting also that classical music criticism had become increasingly available on blogs, and that a number of other major newspapers \"still have full-time classical music critics\", including (in 2007) the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Baltimore Sun\", \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", and \"The Boston Globe\".\n\nMusic writers only started \"treating pop and rock music seriously\" in 1964 \"after the breakthrough of the Beatles\". In their book \"Rock Criticism from the Beginning\", Ulf Lindberg and his co-writers say that rock criticism appears to have been \"slower to develop in the U.S. than in England\". One of the early British music magazines, \"Melody Maker\", complained in 1967 about how \"newspapers and magazines are continually hammering [i.e., attacking] pop music\". From 1964, \"Melody Maker\" led its rival publications in terms of approaching music and musicians as a subject for serious study rather than merely entertainment. Staff reporters such as Chris Welch and Ray Coleman applied a perspective previously reserved for jazz artists to the rise of American-influenced local rock and pop groups, anticipating the advent of rock critics. Among Britain's broadsheet newspapers, pop music gained exposure in the arts section of \"The Times\" when William Mann, the paper's classical music critic, wrote an appreciation of the Beatles in December 1963. In early 1965, \"The Observer\", the country's highbrow Sunday newspaper, signalled a reversal of the establishment's cultural snobbery towards pop music by appointing George Melly as its \"critic of pop culture\". Following Tony Palmer's arrival at \"The Observer\", the first daily newspaper to employ a dedicated rock critic was \"The Guardian\", with the appointment of Geoffrey Cannon in 1968.\n\n\"Melody Maker\"s writers advocated the new forms of pop music of the late 1960s. \"By 1999, the 'quality' press was regularly carrying reviews of popular music gigs and albums\", which had a \"key role in keeping pop\" in the public eye. As more pop music critics began writing, this had the effect of \"legitimating pop as an art form\"; as a result, \"newspaper coverage shifted towards pop as music rather than pop as social phenomenon\".\n\nIn the world of pop music criticism, there has tended to be a quick turnover. The \"pop music industry\" expects that any particular rock critic will likely disappear from popular view within five years; in contrast, according to author Mark Fenster, the \"stars\" of rock criticism are more likely to have long careers with \"book contracts, featured columns, and editorial and staff positions at magazines and newspapers\". \nAuthor Bernard Gendron writes that in the United States \"the emergence of a 'serious' rock press and the rock critic\" began in 1966, presaged by Robert Shelton, the folk music critic for \"The New York Times\", writing articles praising the Beatles and Bob Dylan, the last of whom had just embraced rock 'n' roll by performing with electric backing at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Paul Williams, an eighteen-year-old student, launched the pop journal \"Crawdaddy!\" in February 1966; in June, Richard Goldstein, a recent graduate and New Journalism writer, debuted his \"Pop Eye\" column in \"The Village Voice\", which Gendron describes as \"the first regular column on rock 'n' roll ... to appear in an established cultural publication\". Rock journalist Clinton Heylin, in his role as editor of \"The Penguin Book of Rock & Roll Writing\", cites \"the true genesis of rock criticism\" to the emergence of \"Crawdaddy!\" Lindberg et al. say that, while Williams is widely considered to be the first American rock critic, he \"nevertheless looked to England for material\".\n\nAccording to Gendron, Goldstein's most significant early pieces were a \"manifesto\" on rock 'n' roll and \"pop aestheticism\", and a laudatory assessment of the Beatles' \"Revolver\" album. Published in late August, the latter article provided \"the first substantial rock review devoted to one album to appear in any nonrock magazine with accreditory power\". Whereas Williams could be sure of a sympathetic readership, given the nature of his publication, Goldstein's task was to win over a more highbrow readership to the artistic merits of contemporary pop music. At this time, both Goldstein and Williams gained considerable renown in the cultural mainstream and were the subject of profile articles in \"Newsweek\".\n\nThe emergence of rock journalism coincided with an attempt to position rock music, particularly the Beatles' work, in the American cultural landscape. The critical discourse was further heightened by the respectful coverage afforded the genre in mainstream publications such as \"Newsweek\", \"Time\" and \"Life\" in the months leading up to and following the release of the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album in June 1967. Within this discourse, Richard Meltzer, in an essay for \"Crawdaddy!\" in March, challenged the highbrow aesthetic of rock proposed by Goldstein. The latter's mixed review of \"Sgt. Pepper\" in \"The New York Times\" was similarly the subject of journalistic debate, and invited reprisals from musicologists, composers and cultural commentators.\n\nAmong other young American writers who became pop columnists following Goldstein's appointment were Robert Christgau (at \"Esquire\", from June 1967), Ellen Willis (\"The New Yorker\", March 1968) and Ellen Sander (\"Saturday Review\", October 1968). Christgau was the \"originator of the 'consumer guide' approach to pop music reviews\", an approach that was designed to help readers decide whether to buy a new album.\n\nAccording to popular music academic Roy Shuker in 1994, music reference books such as \"The Rolling Stone Record Guide\" and \"\" played a role in the rise of rock critics as tastemakers in the music industry, \"constructing their own version of the traditional high/low culture split, usually around notions of artistic integrity, authenticity, and the nature of commercialism\". These review collections, Shuker continues, \"became bibles in the field, establishing orthodoxies as to the relative value of various styles or genres and pantheons of artists. Record collectors and enthusiasts, and specialisation and secondhand record shops, inevitably have well-thumbed copies of these and similar volumes close at hand.\"\n\nIn the realm of rock music, as in that of classical music, critics have not always been respected by their subjects. Frank Zappa declared that \"Most rock journalism is people who can't write, interviewing people who can't talk, for people who can't read.\" In the Guns N' Roses song \"Get in the Ring\", Axl Rose verbally attacked critics who gave the band negative reviews because of their actions on stage; such critics as Andy Secher, Mick Wall and Bob Guccione Jr. were mentioned by name.\n\nIn the 2000s, online music bloggers began to supplement, and to some degree displace, music journalists in print media. In 2006, Martin Edlund of the \"New York Sun\" criticized the trend, arguing that while the \"Internet has democratized music criticism, it seems it's also spread its penchant for uncritical hype\".\n\nCarl Wilson described \"an upsurge in pro-pop sentiment among critics\" during the early 2000s, writing that a \"new generation [of music critics] moved into positions of critical influence\" and then \"mounted a wholesale critique against the syndrome of measuring all popular music by the norms of rock culture\".\n\n\"Slate\" magazine writer Jody Rosen discussed the 2000s-era trends in pop music criticism in his article \"The Perils of Poptimism\". Rosen noted that much of the debate is centered on a perception that rock critics regard rock as \"normative ... the standard state of popular music ... to which everything else is compared\". At a 2006 pop critic conference, attendees discussed their \"guilty pop pleasures, reconsidering musicians (Tiny Tim, Dan Fogelberg, Phil Collins) and genres (blue-eyed soul, Muzak)\" which rock critics have long dismissed as lightweight, commercial music. Rosen stated that \"this new critical paradigm\" is called \"popism\" – or, more evocatively (and goofily), \"poptimism\". The poptimism approach states: \"Pop (and, especially, hip-hop) producers are as important as rock auteurs, Beyoncé is as worthy of serious consideration as Bruce Springsteen, and ascribing shame to pop pleasure is itself a shameful act.\"\nIn 2008, Ann Powers of the \"Los Angeles Times\" argued that pop music critics \"have always been contrarians\", because \"pop music [criticism] rose up as a challenge to taste hierarchies, and has remained a pugilistic, exhibitionist business throughout pop's own evolution\". Powers claimed that \"[i]nsults, rejections of others' authority, bratty assertions of superior knowledge and even threats of physical violence are the stuff of which pop criticism is made\", while at the same time, the \"best [pop criticism] also offers loving appreciation and profound insights about how music creates and collides with our everyday realities\". She stated that pop criticism developed as a \"slap at the establishment, at publications such as the hippie homestead \"Rolling Stone\" and the rawker outpost \"Creem\"\", adding that the \"1980s generation\" of post-punk indie rockers had in the mid-2000s \"been taken down by younger 'poptimists,' who argue that lovers of underground rock are elitists for not embracing the more multicultural mainstream\". Powers likened the poptimist critics' debates about bands and styles to a \"scrum in rugby\", in that \"[e]verybody pushes against everybody else, and we move forward in a huge blob of vehement opinion and mutual judgment\".\n\nMusic critic and indie pop musician Scott Miller, in his 2010 book \"\", suggested, \"Part of the problem is that a lot of vital pop music is made by 22-year-olds who enjoy shock value, and it's pathetic when their elders are cornered into unalloyed reverence\". Miller suggested that critics could navigate this problem by being prepared \"to give young artists credit for terrific music without being intimidated into a frame of mind where dark subject matter always gets a passing grade\", stating that a critic should be able to call a young artist \"a musical genius\" while \"in the same breath declaring that his or her lyrics are morally objectionable.\" Reacting to the state of pop music criticism, Miller identified a major issue as critics' failure to \"credit an artist with getting a feeling across\", specifically pointing out critic Lester Bangs as \"a ball of emotion at all times\", who nonetheless \"never really related to his favorite artists as people who develop a skill of conveying feelings. You don't feel that he comfortably acknowledged being moved as a result of their honest work. Artists in his writing were vaguely ridiculous, fascinating primitives, embodying an archetype by accident of nature.\"\n\n\"Jezebel\"s Tracy Moore, in 2014, suggested that one of the virtues of writing about how music made one feel, in contrast with linking it to the sounds of other artists, was to avoid excluding readers who may not have musical knowledge as broad as that of the writer. In contrast, Miller believed that analytical readers would appreciate \"more music talk in music criticism\", suggesting that \"sensitively modest doses\" of musical analysis would provide helpful support for a conclusion \"that great melody writing occurred or it didn't\". For example, Miller noted that critics rarely \"identify catchy melodies as specific passages within a song\", in the way that working musicians might discuss \"the A-minor in the second measure of the chorus\".\n\nStevie Chick, a writer who teaches music journalism at City University London, said, \"I think more than any other journalism, music journalism has got a really powerful creative writing quotient to it.\"\n\nTris McCall of the \"Newark Star-Ledger\" discussed his approach to music criticism in a 2010 interview, stating, \"Most of us [critics] begin writing about music because we love it so much. We can't wait to tell our friends and neighbors about what we're hearing.\" According to McCall, even over the course of a long professional career, the enthusiastic impulse to share \"never fades\". McCall expressed his interest in \"examining why people respond to what they respond to. I hazard guesses. Sometimes I'm wrong, but I hope I'm always provocative.\"\n\nApplying critical theory (\"e.g.\", critical gender studies and critical race theory) to music journalism, some academic writers suggest that mutual disrespect between critics and artists is one of many negative effects of rockism. In 2004, critic Kelefa Sanneh defined \"rockism\" as \"idolizing the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest pop star\". Music journalism \"infected\" with rockism has become, according to Yale professor Daphne Brooks, a challenge \"for those of us concerned with historical memory and popular music performance\".\n\nSimon Frith said that pop and rock music \"are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour\". According to Holly Kruse, both popular music articles and academic articles about pop music are usually written from \"masculine subject positions\". Kembrew McLeod analyzed terms used by critics to differentiate between pop music and rock, finding a gendered dichotomy in descriptions of \"'serious,' 'raw,' and 'sincere' rock music as distinguished from 'trivial', 'fluffy,' and 'formulaic' pop music\". McLeod found that a likely cause of this dichotomy was the lack of women writing in music journalism: \"By 1999, the number of female editors or senior writers at \"Rolling Stone\" hovered around a whopping 15%, [while] at \"Spin\" and \"Raygun\", [it was] roughly 20%.\" Criticism associated with gender was graphically discussed in a 2014 \"Jezebel\" article about the struggles of women in music journalism, written by music critic Tracy Moore, previously an editor at the \"Nashville Scene\". Moore described how another female music blogger, an \"admitted outsider\" who threatened no stereotypes, was greeted with enthusiasm by men, in contrast with Moore's own experiences as a self-described \"insider\" who was nevertheless expected to \"prove\" or \"earn\" her way into a male-dominated journalism scene.\n\nAccording to Anwen Crawford, music critic for Australia's \"The Monthly\", the \"problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago\"; as a result, \"most famous rock-music critics – Robert Christgau, Greil Marcus, Lester Bangs, Nick Kent – are all male\". Crawford points to \"[t]he record store, the guitar shop, and now social media: when it comes to popular music, these places become stages for the display of male prowess\", and adds, \"Female expertise, when it appears, is repeatedly dismissed as fraudulent. Every woman who has ever ventured an opinion on popular music could give you some variation [of this experience] ...and becoming a recognized 'expert' (a musician, a critic) will not save [women] from accusations of fakery.\"\n\nDaphne Brooks, in her 2008 article \"The Write to Rock: Racial Mythologies, Feminist Theory, and the Pleasures of Rock Music Criticism\", wrote that in order to restructure music criticism, one must \"focus on multiple \"counter\"narratives\" to break away from racial and gender biases as embodied in \"contemporary cultural fetishizations of white male performative virtuosity and latent black male innovations\". Brooks focused on \"the ways that rock music criticism has shaped and continues to shape our understandings of racialized music encounters, and what are the alternative stories that we might tell\". Brooks pointed to Christgau's statement that, after the Beatles' arrival in America, \"rock criticism embraced a dream or metaphor of perpetual revolution. Worthwhile bands were supposed to change people's lives, preferably for the better. If they failed to do so, that meant they didn't matter.\" Unsurprisingly, according to Brooks, \"the history of women who've been sustaining a tradition of writing about rock since the 60's\" has been \"largely hidden in American culture\".\n\nBrooks theorized that perceptions of female artists of color might be different if there were more women of color writing about them, and praised Ellen Willis as a significant feminist critic of rock's classic era. Willis, who was a columnist for the \"New Yorker\" from 1968 to 1975, believed society could be enlightened by the \"ecstatic experience\" of visions expressed through music's rhythm and noise and that such joy would lead people to different ways of sharing. Brooks wrote that \"the confluence of cultural studies, rock studies, and third wave feminist critical studies makes it possible now more than ever to continue to critique and reinterrogate the form and content of popular music histories\". In Brooks' view, \"By bravely breaking open dense equations of gender, class, power, and subcultural music scenes\", music journalists, activists and critics such as Ellen Willis have been \"able to brilliantly, like no one before [them], challenge the intellectual and political activism and agency\" of the entire music industry.\n\n"}
{"id": "40705542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40705542", "title": "Oktyabr (magazine)", "text": "Oktyabr (magazine)\n\nOktyabr (meaning \"October\" in English) is a monthly Russian literary magazine, based in Moscow. In addition to \"Novy Mir\" and \"Znamya\" the monthly is a leading and deep-rooted literary magazine in Russia.\n\n\"Oktyabr\" was launched in 1924 by a group with the same name, \"Oktyabr\", which was founded by the poet Alexander Bezymensky and the novelist Yury Libedinsky in 1922. It was an official and conservative magazine of the Soviet Union. Particularly during the post-World War II period it became one of the most pro-government publications and was instrumental in shaping the image of Soviet poetry.\n\nThe editorial board of the magazine in the Soviet era included those figures recognized by the state. The first chief editor was Labory Kalmanson who was also known as G. Lelevich. Fyodor Ivanovich served as chief editor of the monthly for two times (from 1931 to 1954, and then from 1957 to 1961). Vsevolod Kochetov was one of the magazine's chief editors in the 1960s. In the same period, the monthly was a fierce critic of Nikita Khrushchev's reforms, adopting a Stalinist stance. Anatoly Ananiev replaced Kochetov as chief editor of \"Oktyabr\". The current editor-in-chief is Irina Barmetova.\n\nThe magazine awards the \"Oktyabr\" prize. The 2013 winners were Andrey Bitov for the story \"Something with love... \", director Leonid Heifetz for his article \"Flashes\" and poet Lev Kozlowski for a selection of verses \"Sukhoy Bridge\".\n\n\"Oktyabr\" has serialized various novels, published poems and other articles about movies and societal issues. Due to such a wide coverage, the magazine is compared to the 19th century edition of \"Edinburgh Review\". in the late 1970s, Anatoly Rybakov’s novel, \"Heavy Sands\", was serialized in the monthly. \"Life and Fate\", a novel written by Vasily Grossman, was first published in the magazine in 1988. This novel was one of the forbidden literary works in the country and therefore, the magazine became among the publications publishing previously forbidden books in the glasnost period. In 2006, the magazine published Vasili Aksyonov's novel \"Moskva-kva-kva\". The monthly also published poems of significant and state-recognized poets in the Soviet era, forming the image of Soviet poetry, and works on literary criticism.\n\nIn addition to literary works, in the 1960s the magazine covered articles on Soviet films, focusing on the merits of these movies. Mikhail Antonov's a seminal essay, \"So What Is Happening to Us?\", was published in \"Oktyabr\" in 1989.\n\nIn 1989, the magazine published a posthumous work, \"Forever Flowing\", by Vasily Grossman, arguing \"Lenin - all victories of the party and the state are linked with the name of Lenin. But all cruelty committed in the country has become the tragic burden of Vladimir Ilych.\" The article was written long before, but it was one of the first overt criticisms against Lenin. Thus, it marked a serious challenge process towards the past of the country, especially Lenin's legacy.\n"}
{"id": "18960192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18960192", "title": "Parody", "text": "Parody\n\nA parody (); also called a spoof, send-up, take-off, lampoon, play on (something), caricature, or joke is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original work—its subject, author, style, or some other target—by means of satiric or ironic imitation. As the literary theorist Linda Hutcheon puts it, \"parody ... is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text.\" Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as \"any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice.\"\nParody may be found in art or culture, including literature, music (although \"parody\" in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), animation, gaming, and film.\n\nThe writer and critic John Gross observes in his \"Oxford Book of Parodies\", that parody seems to flourish on territory somewhere between pastiche (\"a composition in another artist's manner, without satirical intent\") and burlesque (which \"fools around with the material of high literature and adapts it to low ends\"). Meanwhile, the \"Encyclopédie\" of Denis Diderot distinguishes between the parody and the burlesque, \"A good parody is a fine amusement, capable of amusing and instructing the most sensible and polished minds; the burlesque is a miserable buffoonery which can only please the populace.\" Historically, when a formula grows tired, as in the case of the moralistic melodramas in the 1910s, it retains value only as a parody, as demonstrated by the Buster Keaton shorts that mocked that genre.\n\nAccording to Aristotle (\"Poetics\", ii. 5), Hegemon of Thasos was the inventor of a kind of parody; by slightly altering the wording in well-known poems he transformed the sublime into the ridiculous. In ancient Greek literature, a \"parodia\" was a narrative poem imitating the style and prosody of epics \"but treating light, satirical or mock-heroic subjects.\" Indeed, the components of the Greek word are παρά \"para\" \"beside, counter, against\" and ᾠδή \"oide\" \"song.\" Thus, the original Greek word παρῳδία \"parodia\" has sometimes been taken to mean \"counter-song\", an imitation that is set against the original. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\", for example, defines parody as imitation \"turned as to produce a ridiculous effect.\" Because \"par-\" also has the non-antagonistic meaning of \"beside\", \"there is nothing in \"parodia\" to necessitate the inclusion of a concept of ridicule.\" Old Comedy contained parody, even the gods could be made fun of. \"The Frogs\" portrays the hero-turned-god Heracles as a glutton and the God of Drama Dionysus as cowardly and unintelligent. The traditional trip to the Underworld story is parodied as Dionysus dresses as Heracles to go to the Underworld, in an attempt to bring back a Poet to save Athens.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, Lucian of Samosata, a Greek-language writer in Syria, created a parody of travel/geography texts like Indica and The Odyssey. He described the authors of such accounts as liars who had never traveled, nor talked to any credible person who had. In his ironically named book True History Lucian delivers a story which exaggerates the hyperbole and improbable claims of those stories. Sometimes described as the first Science Fiction, along the lines of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the characters travel to the moon, engage in interplanetary war with the help of aliens they meet there, and then return to the earth to experience civilization inside a 200 mile long creature generally interpreted as being a whale. This is a parody of Ctesias' claims that India has a one-legged race of humans with a single foot so huge it can be used as an umbrella, Homer's stories of one-eyed giants, and so on.\n\nRoman writers explained parody as an imitation of one poet by another for humorous effect. In French Neoclassical literature, \"parody\" was also a type of poem where one work imitates the style of another to produce a humorous effect. The Ancient Greeks created satyr plays which parodied tragic plays, often with performers dressed like satyrs.\n\nIn classical music, as a technical term, \"parody\" refers to a reworking of one kind of composition into another (for example, a motet into a keyboard work as Girolamo Cavazzoni, Antonio de Cabezón, and Alonso Mudarra all did to Josquin des Prez motets). More commonly, a parody mass (\"missa parodia\") or an oratorio used extensive quotation from other vocal works such as motets or cantatas; Victoria, Palestrina, Lassus, and other composers of the 16th century used this technique. The term is also sometimes applied to procedures common in the Baroque period, such as when Bach reworks music from cantatas in his \"Christmas Oratorio\".\n\nThe musicological definition of the term \"parody\" has now generally been supplanted by a more general meaning of the word. In its more contemporary usage, musical parody usually has humorous, even satirical intent, in which familiar musical ideas or lyrics are lifted into a different, often incongruous, context. Musical parodies may imitate or refer to the peculiar style of a composer or artist, or even a general style of music. For example, \"The Ritz Roll and Rock\", a song and dance number performed by Fred Astaire in the movie \"Silk Stockings\", parodies the Rock and Roll genre. Conversely, while the best-known work of Weird Al Yankovic is based on particular popular songs, it also often utilises wildly incongruous elements of pop culture for comedic effect.\n\nThe first usage of the word \"parody\" in English cited in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is in Ben Jonson, in \"Every Man in His Humour\" in 1598: \"A Parodie, a parodie! to make it absurder than it was.\" The next citation comes from John Dryden in 1693, who also appended an explanation, suggesting that the word was in common use, meaning to make fun of or re-create what you are doing.\n\nIn the 20th century, parody has been heightened as the central and most representative artistic device, the catalysing agent of artistic creation and innovation. This most prominently happened in the second half of the century with postmodernism, but earlier modernism and Russian formalism had anticipated this perspective. For the Russian formalists, parody was a way of liberation from the background text that enables to produce new and autonomous artistic forms.\n\nJorge Luis Borges's (1939) short story \"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\", is often regarded as predicting postmodernism and conceiving the ideal of the ultimate parody. In the broader sense of Greek \"parodia\", parody can occur when whole elements of one work are lifted out of their context and reused, not necessarily to be ridiculed. Traditional definitions of parody usually only discuss parody in the stricter sense of something intended to ridicule the text it parodies. There is also a broader, extended sense of parody that may not include ridicule, and may be based on many other uses and intentions. The broader sense of parody, parody done with intent other than ridicule, has become prevalent in the modern parody of the 20th century. In the extended sense, the modern parody does not target the parodied text, but instead uses it as a weapon to target something else. The reason for the prevalence of the extended, recontextualizing type of parody in the 20th century is that artists have sought to connect with the past while registering differences brought by modernity. Major modernist examples of this recontextualizing parody include James Joyce's \"Ulysses\", which incorporates elements of Homer's \"Odyssey\" in a 20th-century Irish context, and T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\", which incorporates and recontextualizes elements of a vast range of prior texts, including Dante's \"The Inferno\". The work of Andy Warhol is another prominent example of the modern \"recontextualizing\" parody. According to French literary theorist Gérard Genette, the most rigorous and elegant form of parody is also the most economical, that is a \"minimal parody\", the one that literally reprises a known text and gives it a new meaning.\n\nBlank parody, in which an artist takes the skeletal form of an art work and places it in a new context without ridiculing it, is common. Pastiche is a closely related genre, and parody can also occur when characters or settings belonging to one work are used in a humorous or ironic way in another, such as the transformation of minor characters Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from Shakespeare's drama Hamlet into the principal characters in a comedic perspective on the same events in the play (and film) \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\". Similarly, Mishu Hilmy's \"Trapped in the Netflix\" uses parody to deconstruct contemporary Netflix shows like Mad Men providing commentary through popular characters. Don Draper mansplaining about mansplaining, Luke Danes monologizing about a lack of independence while embracing codependency. In Flann O'Brien's novel \"At Swim-Two-Birds\", for example, mad King Sweeney, Finn MacCool, a pookah, and an assortment of cowboys all assemble in an inn in Dublin: the mixture of mythic characters, characters from genre fiction, and a quotidian setting combine for a humor that is not directed at any of the characters or their authors. This combination of established and identifiable characters in a new setting is not the same as the post-modernist trope of using historical characters in fiction out of context to provide a metaphoric element.\n\nSometimes the reputation of a parody outlasts the reputation of what is being parodied. For example, \"Don Quixote\", which mocks the traditional knight errant tales, is much better known than the novel that inspired it, \"Amadis de Gaula\" (although Amadis is mentioned in the book). Another case is the novel \"Shamela\" by Henry Fielding (1742), which was a parody of the gloomy epistolary novel \"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded\" (1740) by Samuel Richardson. Many of Lewis Carroll's parodies of Victorian didactic verse for children, such as \"You Are Old, Father William\", are much better known than the (largely forgotten) originals. Stella Gibbons's comic novel \"Cold Comfort Farm\" has eclipsed the pastoral novels of Mary Webb which largely inspired it.\n\nIn more recent times, the television sitcom \"'Allo 'Allo!\" is perhaps better known than the drama \"Secret Army\" which it parodies.\n\nSome artists carve out careers by making parodies. One of the best-known examples is that of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. His career of parodying other musical acts and their songs has outlasted many of the artists or bands he has parodied. Yankovic is not required under law to get permission to parody; as a personal rule, however, he does seek permission to parody a person's song before recording it. Several artists, such as rapper Chamillionaire and Seattle-based grunge band Nirvana stated that Yankovic's parodies of their respective songs were excellent, and many artists have considered being parodied by him to be a badge of honor.\n\nIn the US legal system the point that in most cases a parody of a work constitutes fair use was upheld in the case of Rick Dees, who decided to use 29 seconds of the music from the song \"When Sonny Gets Blue\" to parody Johnny Mathis' singing style even after being refused permission. An appeals court upheld the trial court's decision that this type of parody represents fair use. \"Fisher v. Dees\" 794 F.2d 432 (9th Cir. 1986)\n\nSome genre theorists, following Bakhtin, see parody as a natural development in the life cycle of any genre; this idea has proven especially fruitful for genre film theorists. Such theorists note that Western movies, for example, after the classic stage defined the conventions of the genre, underwent a parody stage, in which those same conventions were ridiculed and critiqued. Because audiences had seen these classic Westerns, they had expectations for any new Westerns, and when these expectations were inverted, the audience laughed.\n\nPerhaps the earliest parody film was the 1922 \"Mud and Sand\", a Stan Laurel film that made fun of Rudolph Valentino's film \"Blood and Sand\". Laurel specialized in parodies in the mid-1920s, writing and acting in a number of them. Some were send-ups of popular films, such as \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\"—parodied in the comic \"Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde\" (1926). Others were spoofs of Broadway plays, such as \"No, No, Nanette\" (1925), parodied as \"Yes, Yes, Nanette\" (1925). In 1940 Charlie Chaplin created a satirical comedy about Adolf Hitler with the film \"The Great Dictator\", following the first-ever Hollywood parody of the Nazis, the Three Stooges' short subject \"You Nazty Spy!\".\n\nAbout 20 years later Mel Brooks started his career with a Hitler parody as well. After \"The Producers\" (1968), Brooks became one of the most famous film parodists and did spoofs on any kind of film genre. \"Blazing Saddles\" (1974) is a parody of western films, \"Young Frankenstein\" (1974) is a Frankenstein spoof, \"Spaceballs\" (1987) is a \"Star Wars\" spoof, and \"Robin Hood Men in Tights\" (1993) is Brooks' take on the classic Robin Hood tale.\n\nThe British comedy group Monty Python is also famous for its parodies, for example, the King Arthur spoof \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" (1974), and the Jesus satire \"Life of Brian\" (1979). In the 1980s the team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker parodied well-established genres such as disaster, war and crime movies with the \"Airplane!\", \"Hot Shots!\" and \"Naked Gun\" series respectively. There is a 1989 film parody from Spain of the TV series \"The A-Team\" called \"El equipo Aahhgg\" directed by José Truchado.\n\nMore recently, parodies have taken on whole film genres at once. One of the first was \"Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\" and the \"Scary Movie\" franchise. Other recent genre parodies include. \"Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday The 13th\", \"Not Another Teen Movie\", \"Date Movie\", \"Epic Movie\", \"Meet the Spartans\", \"Superhero Movie\", \"Disaster Movie\", \"Vampires Suck\", and \"The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It\", all of which have been critically panned.\n\nMany parody films have as their target out-of-copyright or non-copyrighted subjects (such as \"Frankenstein\" or Robin Hood) whilst others settle for imitation which does not infringe copyright, but is clearly aimed at a popular (and usually lucrative) subject. The spy film craze of the 1960s, fuelled by the popularity of James Bond is such an example. In this genre a rare, and possibly unique, example of a parody film taking aim at a non-comedic subject over which it actually holds copyright is the 1967 James Bond spoof \"Casino Royale\". In this case, producer Charles K. Feldman initially intended to make a serious film, but decided that it would not be able to compete with the established series of Bond films. Hence, he decided to parody the series.\n\nKenneth Baker considered poetic parody to take five main forms.\n\nA further, more constructive form of poetic parody is one that links the contemporary poet with past forms and past masters through affectionate parodying – thus sharing poetic codes while avoiding some of the anxiety of influence.\n\nMore aggressive in tone are playground poetry parodies, often attacking authority, values and culture itself in a carnivalesque rebellion: “Twinkle, Twinkle little star,/ Who the hell do you think you are?”\n\nA subset of parody is \"self-parody\" in which artists parody their own work (as in Ricky Gervais's \"Extras\") or distinctions of their work (such as Antonio Banderas's Puss in Boots in the \"Shrek\" sequels) or an artist or genre repeats elements of earlier works to the point that originality is lost.\n\nAlthough a parody can be considered a derivative work of a pre-existing, copyrighted work, some countries have ruled that parodies can fall under copyright limitations such as fair dealing, or otherwise have fair dealing laws that include parody in their scope.\n\nParodies are protected under the fair use doctrine of United States copyright law, but the defense is more successful if the usage of an existing copyrighted work is transformative in nature, such as being a critique or commentary upon it.\n\nIn \"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.\", the Supreme Court ruled that a rap parody of \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" by 2 Live Crew was fair use, as the parody was a distinctive, transformative work designed to ridicule the original song, and that \"even if 2 Live Crew's copying of the original's first line of lyrics and characteristic opening bass riff may be said to go to the original's 'heart,' that heart is what most readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim.\"\n\nIn 2001, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in \"Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin\", upheld the right of Alice Randall to publish a parody of \"Gone with the Wind\" called \"The Wind Done Gone\", which told the same story from the point of view of Scarlett O'Hara's slaves, who were glad to be rid of her.\n\nIn 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied a fair use defense in the \"Dr. Seuss Enterprises v. Penguin Books\" case. Citing the \"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose\" decision, they found that a satire of the O.J. Simpson murder trial and parody of \"The Cat in the Hat\" had infringed upon the children's book because it did not provide a commentary function upon that work.\n\nUnder Canadian law, although there is protection for Fair Dealing, there is no explicit protection for parody and satire. In \"Canwest v. Horizon\", the publisher of the Vancouver Sun launched a lawsuit against a group which had published a pro-Palestinian parody of the paper. Alan Donaldson, the judge in the case, ruled that parody is not a defence to a copyright claim.\n\nIn 2006 the \"Gowers Review of Intellectual Property\" recommended that the UK should \"create an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche by 2008.\" Following the first stage of a two-part public consultation, the Intellectual Property Office reported that the information received \"was not sufficient to persuade us that the advantages of a new parody exception were sufficient to override the disadvantages to the creators and owners of the underlying work. There is therefore no proposal to change the current approach to parody, caricature and pastiche in the UK.\"\n\nHowever, following the Hargreaves Review in May 2011 (which made similar proposals to the Gowers Review) the Government broadly accepted these proposals. The current law (effective from 1 October 2014), namely Section 30A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, now provides an exception to infringement where there is fair dealing of the original work for the purpose of parody (or alternatively for the purpose of caricature or pastiche). The legislation does not define what is meant by \"parody\", but the UK IPO – the Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom) – suggests that a \"parody\" is something that imitates a work\nfor humorous or satirical effect. See also Fair dealing in United Kingdom law.\n\nParody is a prominent genre in online culture, thanks in part to the ease with which digital texts may be altered, appropriated, and shared. Japanese kuso and Chinese e'gao are emblematic of the importance of parody in online cultures in Asia. Video mash-ups and other parodic memes, such as humorously-altered Chinese characters, have been particularly popular as a tool for political protest in the People's Republic of China, the government of which maintains an extensive censorship apparatus. Chinese internet slang makes extensive use of puns and parodies on how Chinese characters are pronounced or written, as illustrated in the Grass-Mud Horse Lexicon.\n\nParody is a frequent ingredient in satire and is often used to make social and political points. Examples include Swift's \"A Modest Proposal\", which satirized English neglect of Ireland by parodying emotionally disengaged political tracts; and, recently, \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Colbert Report\", which parody a news broadcast and a talk show to satirize political and social trends and events.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer and frequent parodist Vladimir Nabokov made a distinction: \"Satire is a lesson, parody is a game.\"\n\nSome events, such as a national tragedy, can be difficult to handle. Chet Clem, Editorial Manager of the news parody publication \"The Onion\", told \"Wikinews\" in an interview the questions that are raised when addressing difficult topics:\nParody is by no means necessarily satirical, and may sometimes be done with respect and appreciation of the subject involved, without being a heedless sarcastic attack.\n\nParody has also been used to facilitate dialogue between cultures or subcultures. Sociolinguist Mary Louise Pratt identifies parody as one of the \"arts of the contact zone\", through which marginalized or oppressed groups \"selectively appropriate\", or imitate and take over, aspects of more empowered cultures.\n\nShakespeare often uses a series of parodies to convey his meaning. In the social context of his era, an example can be seen in \"King Lear\" where the fool is introduced with his coxcomb to be a parody of the king.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4129275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4129275", "title": "Rundfunk der DDR", "text": "Rundfunk der DDR\n\nRundfunk der DDR (, \"Radio of the GDR\") was the radio broadcasting organisation for the German Democratic Republic (GDR) from 1952 until German reunification, after which it continued until 1991 as Funkhaus Berlin (\"Broadcasting Center Berlin\"). The organization was based in the \"Funkhaus Nalepastraße\" in East Berlin.\n\nThe pre-war Deutschlandsender stations, under the control of Joseph Goebbels' Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda as the \"Großdeutsche Rundfunk\", were closed by the Allied forces upon Germany's surrender in May 1945. On 13 May 1945, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SMAG) began a radio broadcasting service to the people of Berlin called Berliner Rundfunk, operating from what would become the British sector of West Berlin. The station was controlled by Walter Ulbricht.\n\nWhen the three Western occupation sectors in Berlin were established, the American zone gained the station Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor (RIAS), while the British zone established the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) which also broadcast in their zone. In 1948, control of the NWDR was transferred to the provisional government in West Germany (later becoming Sender Freies Berlin), while RIAS remained under direct American control.\n\nOn 15 September 1952, the SMAG formally transferred control of broadcasting in the GDR to the East German government.\n\nAfter the construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, the GDR began a programme to attempt to prevent its citizens from listening to broadcasts from RIAS and Sender Freies Berlin (SFB), the local outlet of the West German broadcasting consortium ARD. The \"Freie Deutsche Jugend\" (Free German Youth), the official youth movement in the GDR, started the campaign \"Blitz contra Natosender\" - \"Lightning against NATO's transmitters\" - to encourage young people to remove or turn away aerials pointing at the west. The term \"Republikflüchtigen\" (Defection by Television) was sometimes used to describe the widespread practice of viewing \"Westfernsehen\" (Western TV).\n\nThe GDR also instituted a programme of jamming foreign signals, both shortwave broadcasts from international broadcasters such as the BBC and local broadcasts such as RIAS. A network of jamming stations was built covering the entire country. However, attempts to jam broadcasts from West Berlin were soon abandoned as it was found to be impossible to do so effectively without also disrupting reception within West Germany - which was outlawed by treaty - and also ran the risk of counter-jamming of East German stations.\n\nNevertheless, people continued (or attempted) to listen to RIAS and SFB/ARD broadcasts. In 1981, a further attempt was made to draw GDR radio listeners - especially the young - from western broadcasts by launching a youth radio station, DT64. By 1985 there were 6,646,500 licensed radios in the country, or 39.9 for every 100 persons.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, the radio organisation of the GDR began to shut down as services from West Germany were introduced and the GDR's stations were renamed and refocused in anticipation of the country joining the existing ARD system on 1 January 1992.\n\nUpon reunification in October 1990, two new public broadcasters (Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg in the east and Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk in the south) were created, and two existing West German public broadcasters expanded their coverage areas (Norddeutscher Rundfunk from the north of the Federal Republic to the north of the whole country, and Sender Freies Berlin from West Berlin to the entire city).\n\nIn 1994, RIAS merged with the GDR's Deutschlandsender Kultur to become DeutschlandRadio Berlin, which later became Deutschlandradio Kultur.\n\n\n\n\nThe Soviet Union maintained a service for its troops on GDR soil, \"Radio Wolga\", which broadcast on 261 kHz longwave. The Soviet foreign service was broadcast from East Germany on 1323 kHz mediumwave. \"Radio Wolga\" was closed when the last Soviet troops left German soil.\n\nAt Soviet military barracks, Programme 1 of Soviet television was transmitted on low power for the soldiers, in a similar way to the highly localised broadcasts of AFN, SSVC, CFN and the French FFB in the west. The last Russian transmitter was closed in 1994.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "974936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=974936", "title": "Shockwave (Transformers)", "text": "Shockwave (Transformers)\n\nShockwave is the name of several fictional characters in the Transformers robot superhero franchise. Throughout his incarnations, he is usually distinguished by a laser cannon instead of one of his hands and his distinctive face, which is featureless save for a single robotic eye. He is also commonly portrayed as a cold, emotionless Decepticon that serves as Megatron's \"mad scientist\". Due to issues with Hasbro's trademark of the name Shockwave, some products were also released under the name Shockblast or \"Shockblast the Great\".\n\nAs the Decepticons' military operations commander, Shockwave's power is second only to Megatron, and even that is disputed. His actions are carried out with the cold, brutal clarity and perfection one would expect of a purely mechanical being—his way is not that of blood lust, like so many other Decepticons, but rather that of a scientist attempting to solve a problem. And that problem is: how can he use his abilities to most effectively eliminate the greatest number of enemies? Unfortunately for the Autobots, it is rare that Shockwave does not find an answer.\n\nUnlike most early Transformers Shockwave was not modified into an Earthly form, and retains his Cybertron alternate mode—a 35-foot-long ray gun. He possesses the power of flight in both modes, and commands the totality of the electromagnetic spectrum allowing him to emit beams of energy in a wide variety of forms. His high energy output makes him particularly fuel inefficient, but radioactive fuel sources stored in the reactor in his chest can help Shockwave to overcome this problem. Although his logical brain center is usually an advantage, human adversaries often pose more of a difficulty to Shockwave, as more intuitive and emotional thought processes often confound him.\n\nWhile the animated series established Shockwave as fanatically loyal to Megatron, Shockwave's original bio and most fiction since have described him as coldly and patiently looking for ways to overthrow Megatron, not for personal power (as Starscream would) but simply because it was logical for him to do so. Shockwave, who is possibly even more powerful than Megatron, concluded that he should rule so that no emotion should prevent the Decepticons from conquering the universe. This was retained in most comic books, where Shockwave became leader of the Decepticons.\n\nUnusually for a 1985 (second year) toy, Shockwave was part of Transformers fiction from the first year, appearing in both the original cartoon pilot and 4-issue comic book miniseries.\n\nAccording to writer Bob Budiansky, the character of Shockwave was inspired by Spock from the \"Star Trek\" series.\n\nShockwave was voted the 2nd top Transformer who was \"badass\" in the comics by Topless Robots. Wired Magazine once nominated him as one of the 12 most ridiculous Transformers of all time.\n\nShockwave's characterization in the animated series is based on an early profile written for the character which presented him to be the guardian of Cybertron, with no desires beyond that station. His toy's tech spec and \"Transformers Universe\" profile, however, wrote of a character who sought to overthrow Megatron and rule the Decepticons because he views it as the logical thing to do. This was the version of the character who impressed fans with his appearance in Marvel's \"Transformers\" comic book series. Also, unlike his cartoon incarnation, in which he was depicted as an easily beatable foe, his comic incarnation was very powerful.\n\nHere, Shockwave was part of the Decepticon unit that pursued the Ark, but he held back from actually attacking the craft, remaining on the Decepticons' own space cruiser and following the Ark down to prehistoric Earth when it crashed. His guiding systems disrupted by his travel through Earth's atmosphere, Shockwave touched down in Antarctica, specifically, in the Savage Land, whose dinosaur inhabitants the Ark used as a basis to reconstruct five Autobots to battle Shockwave. These \"Dinobots\" engaged Shockwave, but he slyly outmaneuvered them, and managed to trap them in a tar pit one by one by picking them off from a safe distance with his superior firepower. A stalemate was reached when the last strike by the Dinobots before sinking into the pit saw them bury Shockwave under a landslide, where he remained for four million years.\n\nIn 1984, Shockwave was reawakened by an Autobot probe dispatched from the Ark. He quickly struck the weakened Autobots, who had just defeated Megatron's forces. Deactivating them all and stringing them up in the Ark, which he took for his own base, Shockwave brought the Decepticons back online to serve him, and was soon challenged for leadership by a wounded Megatron, whom he soundly defeated and brought under his heel. As Decepticon commander, Shockwave commandeered the Blackrock Aerospace Plant, using its resources to construct new Transformers, which he then gave life using the Creation Matrix, siphoned from Optimus Prime. However, Prime was able to transfer the Matrix into Buster Witwicky's mind, preventing Shockwave from giving life to his newest creation, Jetfire. Shockwave instead programmed Jetfire to acquire Buster, but Buster was able to reprogram and give life to Jetfire and took Shockwave out of the game long enough to recover Optimus Prime's severed head. Prime then battled Shockwave and hurled him into a swamp.\n\nShockwave was able to extricate himself in short order, and attempted a series of failed plans, such as draining sonic energy from a rock concert and attempting to control Bumblebee. When Megatron resurfaced, he and Shockwave clashed again, but settled into a brief period of shared leadership until Shockwave fell victim to an Autobot trap, and saw the logic in Megatron's accusations of failure, ceding command to him. However, in the UK comic Shockwave did not stand for this for long, and he soon sent the Predacons in to assassinate both Optimus and Megatron, failing after Megatron teleported himself and Prime to Cybertron and only just managing to cover his tracks without Megatron knowing it was him. When Megatron began to descend into paranoid insanity after the death of Optimus Prime, Shockwave attempted to take advantage of the situation by arranging a staged attack by the Predacons (in the U.K. comic, the dialogue was rewritten to say that due to his insanity, Megatron had forgotten his original battle with them). Megatron defeated them even in their combined mode of Predaking, but when Shockwave revealed that he had duplicated his mind to disc to guide the Predacons during their hunt, Megatron's deranged mind (accurately) began to believe that this was how Optimus Prime had survived. Desperate and insane, Megatron apparently killed himself by blowing up the spacebridge while he was on it, once again allowing Shockwave to take leadership. However, he soon faced various objections courtesy of Ratbat, the local Decepticon commander on Cybertron, who criticized his operations for being too fuel-inefficient. Arriving on Earth to oversee Shockwave's work, Ratbat encountered Buster Witwicky, whom he captured and brought to the Decepticons' mobile island base. With the Autobot Headmasters in pursuit, Shockwave transformed the island into its rocket mode and blasted off, but in a space-bound battle with Fortress Maximus, Shockwave was defeated and sent hurtling into Earth's atmosphere, where he seemingly burned up.\n\nAlthough this would be all that the U.S. comics would see of Shockwave for some time, this was not the case for its sister title, the U.K.-based \"Transformers\" comic, which reprinted the American stories with their own original material intertwined. In previous UK stories, Shockwave had run afoul of the future Decepticon leader, Galvatron, who was attempting to disrupt his leadership in the present to ensure the loyalty of his army in the future. After his battle with Fortress Maximus, Shockwave was revealed to have survived his fall back to Earth and returned to the Decepticons' original castle base, where he had the Seacons acquire the body of what was apparently Megatron (but would, in actuality, be later revealed as a clone), which he brainwashed into doing his bidding in order to pit him against Galvatron. When he was visited by the other future Decepticons, Cyclonus and Scourge and learned that in their future, they would kill him, he unleashed Megatron upon them, who killed Cyclonus. Shockwave then turned Megatron upon Galvatron, but rather than destroy him, he saw a potential partner in Galvatron, and they teamed up to battle Autobots and Decepticons from both the present and future in the \"Time Wars\", as a rift in the space-time continuum bore down on them. Shockwave, however, had become a prisoner of his own logic - to seal the rift it was necessary to return Cyclonus's body to it, thereby saving everyone, including himself. A logical action. However, to do so would be to condemn himself to death in the future by Cyclonus and Scourge's hands. Illogical. Unable to cope with the paradox, Shockwave went insane, but was saved by Ravage, who pointed out that, equipped with knowledge of his death, he could prevent it. His mind restored, Shockwave returned Cyclonus's body to the rift, after Galvatron and Scourge were consumed by it, and sealed it shut with an X-ray blast. The day had been saved, but Optimus Prime promised him that the next time they met, it would be as enemies.\n\nA short time later, Shockwave went on to make his return to the pages of the U.S. comic, as he established a small splinter cell of Decepticons, consisting of himself, Starscream, Mindwipe, Triggerhappy, Ravage, Runabout and Runamuck. Declaring civil war against the current Decepticon Earth commander, Scorponok, Shockwave battled him in New Jersey, only for the conflict to be interrupted when all the Transformers were transported back to Cybertron by their deity, Primus to battle Unicron. Awestruck by the chaos-bringer, even Shockwave's vast data-grid could not compute a logical course of action, and he and Starscream hijacked the Ark and fled the planet shortly after Unicron's defeat. However, the Dinobots had previously treated the Transformers stored in the Ark's stasis pods with the life-restoring fuel, Nucleon - and among those Transformers was the true Megatron, who battled with Galvatron, who had also stowed away on board the craft. Galvatron came to his senses in time, realizing that if Megatron was killed, he could cease to exist, and hid as Shockwave arrived to kill a weakened and disorientated Megatron. Galvatron intervened, but in an attempt to break the cycle of violence that seemingly bound him and Megatron, the Autobot Ratchet crashed the Ark into Earth. Shockwave was last seen in pain as Megatron and Galvatron advanced on him just before the ship crashed. His fate remains unknown. He did not appear again in either the remainder of the US \"Generation 1\" comics or the subsequent \"Generation 2\" comics.\n\nIn the \"Earthforce\" sequence of UK comic stories, both Shockwave and Megatron were running separate Decepticon cells on Earth, fighting both Autobot and each other. (It was never really explained where the Earthforce stories fit into continuity, though many believe it takes place vaguely between the original comics and the G2 run) It was clear that unless they were united, the Decepticons could not ever defeat the Autobots, and so Soundwave and Starscream organized a coup of both cells and reunified them as a single army. Shockwave and Megatron were forced to team up to retake control.\n\nThe second wave of Decepticon Headmasters would appear in the U.K. Marvel comic issue #234, \"Prime's Rib!\" This story is set in the near future, 1995, where Optimus Prime, Jazz and Hot Rod introduce the latest Autobot, Arcee, to the human feminists. She was met with displeasure by the humans, being called a token female and disliked for her pink color. They were then attacked by Shockwave, Fangry, Horri-Bull and Squeezeplay, who thought the Autobot would be unveiling a new weapon. The Autobots fought off the Decepticons, who escaped, but nothing seemed to please the human feminists.\n\nIn the U.K. comic stories set after the Transformers movie, it is revealed Shockwave survived the attack from Unicron and took command of the Decepticons in 2006 and, as Rodimus Prime was focused on finding Galvatron, was able to conquer half of Cybertron from under the Autobots. Part of his rule involved keeping Cyclonus & Scourge from ever being in a position to usurp him, even arranging for them to botch Death's Head's hit on Prime so he would kill them - this failed when Unicron sent them, backed up by a mind-controlled Death's Head, to assassinate him and take control of the Decepticons. Death's Head eventually killed Shockwave after a grueling battle, promising to avenge him even as he blew him apart.\n\nThough a major character in the Marvel comics, Shockwave was a minor character in the cartoon, only making occasional appearances, and was unquestioningly loyal to Megatron. When Megatron prepared to lead his troops in pursuit of the Autobots on the Ark, Shockwave was instructed to stay behind and guard Cybertron in Megatron's absence. Swearing that Cybertron would remain as Megatron left it, Shockwave performed his duty to the letter for four million years, after Megatron and the other Transformers were entombed in stasis on Earth.\n\nSo accurately did Shockwave carry out his task, however, that no advances were achieved in the war, and the deadlock slowly caused what little supplies of energy the planet had to dwindle. In the Earth year 1984, Shockwave again attempted to make contact with the lost Megatron - only this time, he received a reply. The Transformers on Earth had been awakened, and immediately, Shockwave and Megatron co-created the Space Bridge, an inter-galactic transport system, with which to send Energon cubes made from Earth's energy to the depleted planet. In the first tests of the spacebridge, Megatron was transported to Cybertron himself, but Shockwave soon returned him so that further transport runs could be conducted.\n\nSpacebridge technology was taken to its ultimate extreme in \"The Ultimate Doom\" when Shockwave and Megatron co-ordinated the transportation of Cybertron itself into the Solar System via the use of a colossal spacebridge.\n\nIn \"Countdown to Extinction\", when Starscream arrives on Cybertron (together with Doctor Arkeville) and proclaims himself the new leader of the Decepticons instead of the \"late\" Megatron, Shockwave does not believe him and tries to call up Megatron again and again. Starscream forbids him to do this and even fires at his computer terminal, but then he becomes too busy with preparing to receive the energy of the Earth's annihilation. Meanwhile, Shockwave succeeds in getting through to Megatron at last and in warning him of the explosive device installed by Starscream in the Arkeville's laboratory, so that Megatron and Optimus Prime have time to prevent the explosion and to save the Earth.\n\nShockwave briefly came to Earth and joined Megatron's troops in episode #23 \"The Autobot Run\", but returned to Cybertron shortly thereafter (this was later confirmed an animation error.)\n\nIn 1985, Shockwave contended with the power of the Dinobots when they splintered off from the Autobots and came to Cybertron in \"Desertion of the Dinobots\", episodes #37-38. With the aid of his guards, Shockwave was able to overpower them and put them to work in the Cybertronian pits, but failed to prevent the escape of Spike Witwicky and his friend Carly, when they pursued the Dinobots to the planet and were able to effect their release.\n\nSoon after in episode #53 \"The Search for Alpha Trion\", Shockwave discovered that a guerrilla team of Female Autobots, believed to be destroyed by a missile strike during the Ark's launch four million years ago, had been raiding his Energon stores for years, and successfully tracked them back to their hidden base, arranging the capture of Elita One. Optimus Prime and three of his warriors came to Cybertron to aid their female allies, and Elita One herself blasted Shockwave out of the battle. Subsequently, Shockwave located the key to Vector Sigma for Megatron so he could give personalities to the Stunticons (and in a cut scene, battled and seriously damaged Omega Supreme). Spying on the Autobots, he then discovered the key's hidden power to transform organics into technomatter, and later reported to Megatron when he saw the Autobots create the Aerialbots.\n\nIn the beginning of \"Starscream's Brigade\", Megatron is talking about how great Shockwave is, and Starscream is annoyed with it. When it results in a clash, Starscream was exiled from the Decepticons and to the island of Guadalcanal. On the island, he then decides to build an army using the old World War II vehicles on the island and traveled to Cybertron by Spacebridge. Evading Shockwave, he broke into a Decepticon detention center and stole personality components of five renegade Decepticons. Although Shockwave is unaware that Starscream raided the detention center, he does notice the missing components and reports to Megatron, who at first thought that Optimus Prime was the thief. In the sequel episode, \"The Revenge of Bruticus\", the vengeful Combaticons invaded Cybertron. Shockwave attempted to fend them off, but was turned against his sentinel drones when Bruticus (the combined form of the Combaticons) seized him stunned in gun mode and opened fire on them with him, before launching him off into space, where he crashed into Starscream. Little did Shockwave know, Starscream stole the personality components of five renegade Decepticons and the Combaticons were created from them. He and Starscream returned to the planet, but were captured and imprisoned by the Combaticons. They both were discharged when Optimus Prime and Megatron's forces teamed up and arrived to stop Bruticus' rampage.\n\nOver the next two decades, Megatron turned his attention away from Earth, and succeeded in fully conquering Cybertron. In 2005, the Decepticons launched an attack on Autobot City. Shockwave was seen at the battle and also Starscream's coronation later. These appear to be animation errors, as he was always at his post to guard Cybertron. When the planet came under attack by Unicron, Shockwave attempted to mobilize the Decepticons against the threat. The script for \"\" explicitly details Shockwave's death as Unicron crushes his command tower with him in it, rips it off the planet, and tears it to shreds, and although this was not shown in the finished film, Shockwave was not seen again following the movie (although several incorrectly colored versions of Shockwave—presumably intended to be generic Decepticons—were seen in some third-season episodes of the TV series, most notably \"Five Faces of Darkness\" Parts 1-5). The IDW Publishing adaptation of the movie has Shockwave lead the Decepticons against Unicron, only to be blown in half by the Chaos-Bringer's eye beams.\n\nIn Shockwave's first appearance, in \"More Than Meets the Eye\", Part One, he has two hands. By his next appearance, in the first episode of the ongoing series, \"Transport to Oblivion\", his left hand has been replaced with a gun barrel, matching his toy appearance (although notably the toy's box art itself incorrectly presented the gun barrel as being on his \"right\" arm). He later becomes the leader of the Decepticons and the last Transformer. He is killed by humans three times before he becomes Shockblast (2018 comics).\n\nShockwave was a major character in the Dreamwave Productions' 21st century re-imagining of G1. As a major player in the Decepticon army in Cybertron's past, he led the main attack on the Autobots' stronghold shortly after the appointment of Optimus Prime, and personally destroyed two Omega Sentinels with one blast in space gun mode. There was also tension between him and Starscream about who would lead the Decepticons after Megatron's supposed death, which eventually led to the creation of multiple splinter factions within both the Autobots and Decepticons. While Starscream created his own faction, the \"Predacons\", Shockwave led the Decepticons through the \"Dark Ages\" of Cybertron, during which his logic allowed him to put aside differences with Jetfire and the Autobots in order to defeat the greater evil of The Fallen. As the Dark Ages came to an end, Shockwave was ready to sign a peace treaty with Ratbat's Ultracons and the Autobots, but the return of Megatron derailed the plan, though the Quintesson-created clones he brought back to the planet with him greatly intrigued Shockwave.\n\nShockwave was left behind on Cybertron while Megatron's forces pursued Optimus Prime and were subsequently lost on Earth for four million years, and became Decepticon leader on the planet. He began experimenting with cloning, and through studies of Astrotrain and Blitzwing, began to conceive the idea of a Transformer with multiple alternate modes. Eventually, however, Shockwave and all the other Transformers on Cybertron succumbed to stasis lock as the planet's energy ran out, and it entered a hibernation phase known as the \"Great Shutdown.\" During this period of inactivity, 3,000 years ago, Unicron's herald Scourge located the planet, and reactivated Shockwave for study purposes. However, when Shockwave was attacked by a swarm of Sharkticons, Scourge intervened, and after saving him, was shot by Shockwave, who then proceeded to study him, learning much of the function and purpose of Transformers and Cybertron from the secrets within Scourge.\n\nShockwave steadily worked to restore Cybertron, reactivating its population and solving their energy needs, ending the war and unifying the planet. He also continued his experiments into multiple transformations, yielding the unstable Duocons, and then successfully mastering the process with Triple Changers. Capturing Alpha Trion, Shockwave sought to unlock the full secrets of Vector Sigma, having already learned of the mysterious significance of Earth to the Transformer race. In preparation for the invasion of the planet, Shockwave subliminally influenced the population of Cybertron to become more violent, and prevented the return of Optimus Prime and Megatron aboard the Ark II by having a human agent blow it up.\n\nIn 2003, Shockwave made his move, heading to Earth with his Triple Changer troops and capturing Megatron and Optimus's forces, planning to try the two leaders as war criminals. Megatron was jettisoned into space by Starscream, while Prime's escape from his clutches led him to fall in with a rebel group, and then to confront Shockwave himself, only to be defeated by the Decepticon, who ripped the Matrix from him. Using the Matrix to activate Vector Sigma, Shockwave downloaded the compressed contents of the mega-computer into his network, but before he had an opportunity to view the data, he was pulled into a battle with Ultra Magnus. In the course of the fight, the fuel line to his cannon was severed, and the resulting explosion destroyed his citadel and knocked him into a chasm.\n\nWhile the rest of Cybertron believed Shockwave to be deceased, he had actually survived the explosion and gone underground in the wastelands of Cybertron with Astrotrain, Blitzwing, and the Conehead seekers Dirge, Ramjet, and Thrust. He continued his experimentation, resulting in Sixshot. Soon after, however, Megatron returned to Cybertron and bested Shockwave, taking him to Earth where he did the same to Starscream. But now, the three players were assembled, each knowing certain dark secrets of Cybertron's past. Unfortunately, Dreamwave's bankruptcy and subsequently closure at the start of 2005 means that currently, this story remains unresolved.\n\nShockwave also appeared in several other Dreamwave miniseries, including Transformers/G.I. Joe ( where he was given a World War II artillery cannon alternate mode) and the Micromasters series. In this series, set after The War Within but before the Great Shutdown, Shockwave is in command of the Cybertron Decepticons, with Scorponok and Ratbat serving under him. Later in the series a low-on-fuel Shockwave is defeated by the Micromaster Skystalker and decapitated. Whether this mini-series is in continuity with the main Generation One series is unclear.\n\nShockwave was also in the second G.I. Joe vs the Transformers series from Devil's Due Publishing. In this Shockwave had taken control of the Decepticon army after Megatron's disappearance and conquered Cybertron, forcing the Autobots underground. However, this all changed when Cobra Commander hacked into Teletraan III with the aim of creating a wormhole to Cybertron where he could steal more Transformer technology. G.I. Joe attempted to interfere and they, along with Cobra and Cobra Commander's personal transport Starscream were all transported to Cybertron. Shockwave arrived with his troops (including Cyclonus, Scourge, and the Conehead seekers) and attempted to eliminate them. However a squad of Autobots led by Ultra Magnus stop them, keeping the Decepticons out by erecting a shield generator. While the Joes and Cobra forces attempted to locate several time-displaced Transformers (including Optimus Prime), Shockwave's forces battered at the shield and eventually overwhelmed it, capturing most of the humans and Teletran 3 and wounding Ratchet in the process. The humans were able to sneak in and undo the blocks on the time-displacement equipment, allowing the last Transformers to return - the Dinobots, reconfigured into their now-familiar dinosaur modes. They wiped out most of Shockwave's forces and severely damaged Shockwave. As Starscream tried to weasel his way out of being killed by Shockwave for his part in the fiasco, both were instead eliminated when Cobra Commander activated his \"parting gift\" to the traitorous Starscream - 45 pounds of plastic explosives.\n\nDespite the character being notoriously difficult to kill, it seems Shockwave did indeed perish in the explosion. In the third crossover a group of Autobots and G.I. Joes returning to Cybertron via the Spacebridge are attacked by Cannabilizers - old and damaged Transformers after spare parts. One of these clearly has Shockwave's gun arm.\n\nThe \"Transformers Classics\" comics published in the Official Transformers Collectors Club magazine is set in the Marvel Comics continuity, but in a timeline where the events of \"Generation 2\" did not occur. Shockwave's severed but still living head appears among Megatron's troops.\n\nShockwave was among Megatron's troops when Megatron defeated Deathsaurus in combat for leadership of the Decepticons and when Megatron attacked Iacon with his new weapon, Devastator.\n\nSince the Dreamwave bankruptcy, the Transformers license has been acquired by IDW Publishing, who have begun to issue their own Transformers series. , an alternate reality set during America's Industrial Revolution, features Shockwave reconfigured as a Confederate-style Ironclad. He is the first Transformer to reveal himself to the humans, transforming from boat mode at the end of issue #1. Although he only briefly appeared after this in issue #2, showing Tobias Muldoon the Decepticon base, he was presumably destroyed when Bumblebee and John Henry managed to send the entire Decepticon rail convoy into a chasm.\n\nIn the main IDW Transformers universe, Generation One Shockwave made his first appearance in the first issue of \"\". In this single-issue story, Shockwave sees the coming state of Cybertron (which, as \"\" would show, would turn out to be accurate). Launching energon missiles into space, one crashes on Earth with Shockwave looking on this as an experiment in progress. However, he was interrupted by the Dinobots, seeking revenge for a past defeat involving Shockwave stealing their energon cache. They adopted the forms of extinct dinosaurs to combat the high energon levels of the planet. Despite the ferocity of the Dynobots' assault he was still able to defeat them all. However, Grimlock, anticipating possible defeat, programmed their ship to fire upon their location if they did not return, burying them all in lava, until a human archeology team discovered them many years later. In \"\" it was revealed the bodies of both Shockwave and the Dynobots had been uncovered by the mysterious defense organization Skywatch.\n\nShockwave's actions here serve as a prequel to other story lines: the rich energon seams Shockwave plants here are discovered by Starscream's infiltration unit, leading to the events of \"Infiltration\", while Megatron, at the story's close, assigns Bludgeon to seal off Shockwave's research, implying that this is how he gains the knowledge he has in \"Stormbringer\".\n\nIt is hinted in the Spotlight that Shockwave at one point cut himself off from his emotions.\n\nShockwave is subsequently reactivated by Skywatch to locate and nullify Laserbeak, Ravage, and the Dinobots whom Skywatch have lost control of. Soundwaves help is obtained to break a code that Skywatch have planned to detonate a bomb in Shockwaves head if he does not do Skywatch's bidding. Upon locating the Dinobots Shockwave firstly engages and defeats Scorponok in battle, and then turns his attentions to Grimlock. However Soundwave correctly encrypts Skywatch's codes enabling Shockwave to disengage the Bomb, at this point Shockwave disengages the battle with Grimlock and walks away, only for Grimlock to detonate a bomb burying them both in rubble. Shockwave is subsequently captured and imprisoned by Ultra Magnus.\n\nIn the recent mini series Last Stand of the Wreckers it was revealed that when the sadisic renegade Decepticon known as Overlord took control of the Autobot pirson \"The Last Resort\" he freed Shockwave and gave him a hand picked crew of Decepticons in return for Shockwave disabling the safe guards he had implanted in him under Megatron's orders, just as he had done to Overlord's fellow Phase Six Decepticons Sixshot and Black Shadow.\n\nFollowing his escape Shockwave joined up with the Decepticons currently faltering under Starscream's weak and ineffective leadership. He claims to be working on repairing the Space Bridge though Megatron, still on life support following his battle with Optimus Prime, suspects that he is not being completely truthful.\n\nShockwave staged a comeback in 2005's \"\" toy line, which featured classic characters re-interpreted with modern vehicular alternate modes. Although the American toys offered no supporting fiction, the storyline included with the Japanese version of the line, Binaltech, detailed the story of Shockwave's rebirth in this unusual new form.\n\nWhen the time-displaced Decepticon agent, Ravage, used the time machine called the Kronosphere to alter the time line (branching off the Binaltech/Alternators storyline from the continuity of the G1 animated series), the chaos that ensued resulted in the destruction of Shockwave's body. With Ravage's aid, his mind was installed into a stolen Autobot \"Binaltech\" body, equipped with a prototype \"Transmuter\" device, which, when interfaced with Shockwave's personality component, allowed the chassis to \"transmute\" itself into Shockwave's recognizable physical form, including his cyclopean visage and gun-arm. He wields a Turbo Rifle which can also serve as a power booster for his gun-arm, and can project up to five holographic duplicates of himself anywhere on the planet (an ability mentioned in the series bible for the original animated series, but never put to use until episode 4).\n\nIn the \"Megas XLR\" episode \"Ice Ice Megas\", the robots of the Cerilian Army resemble Shockwave in almost every way, except color and alt mode. All of them were voiced by Jeff Bennett.\n\nIn an episode of \"Robot Chicken\", Shockwave finds Soundwave in eBay and asks Megatron if he buys it now.\n\nShockwave also appears in the \"MacGyver\" episode \"The Black Corsage\".\n\n\n\nMegatron, Shockwave and Ravage are the three Decepticon figures available to play in the Monopoly Transformers Collectors Edition game.\n\n\"Shockwave\" was the name Takara used for the character called Tidal Wave by Hasbro. Hasbro's original design for the figure cast him in shades of purple and gray, although they later abandoned this in favor of a green and gray scheme for their figure; the animated series, however, had gone into production before this last-minute change, resulting in the cartoon incarnation of the character being rendered in the purple and gray scheme. Accordingly, in the interest of show-accuracy, Takara release their figure in this color scheme, rather than the altered Hasbro one - happily, these colors fit suitably well with his Japanese name in hearkening back to the purple-and-gray G1 Shockwave, although it is unclear whether or not this was intentional, though unlikely since Shockwave was known as Laserwave in the Japanese dub of the G1 cartoon.\n\nAlthough the assorted \"Transformers\" series which followed the original often paid homage to many popular characters by naming new characters after them, or sculpting them to share their likeness, Shockwave was without a homage in the US for over a decade—it would not be until the midst of 2004's \"Transformers: Energon\" line that Shockwave received this honor in the form of Shockblast. Hasbro had since lost the trademark to the name \"Shockwave\" to Lanard Toys (as noted above), and compensated as best they could through use of this altered name. As previously noted, in Japan, Takara still retained the rights to their original name, hence there, Shockblast was still named Laserwave.\n\nHugely egotistical, cold, ruthless, and a genius, Shockblast is sometimes loyal to Megatron but occasionally acts like Starscream and seeks to overthrow his master. Shockblast's capacity for ruthlessness exceeds even that of Megatron which makes his personality a cross between his leaders and Starscream's. However, despite that, Starscream himself even under Megatron's control seems to respect Shockblast. The power-hungry Shockblast transforms into an orbital Satellite and a ground-based assault vehicle (although in the animated series, he only transformed into the former). He has an unspecified history with Tidal Wave, who distrusts him (the Japanese dub of the series indicated that this was because Shockblast was part of Tidal Wave's platoon, and turned on his fellow Decepticons after the Autobots were defeated).\n\nConsidered to be one of the most dangerous and deadly Decepticons, Shockblast was captured by the Autobots and imprisoned on Cybertron. In the Earth year 2020, when Megatron attacked Cybertron with Unicron, he instructed some Decepticon agents on the planet to liberate Shockblast. Shockblast, however, had already begun to effect his own escape amidst the chaos Megatron's attack was causing, and broke free of his restraints just as a Decepticon agent arrived at his cell, and was killed by Shockblast simply because he had no need of him. In making his escape, Shockblast killed one of his guards, Padlock, causing his other jailer, Wing Dagger, to swear revenge.\n\nShockblast immediately rankled under Megatron's leadership, and was attacked by Wing Dagger when he led a new attack on Cybertron. Tidal Wave was ordered to aid him, but Shockblast had already collapsed an Energon Tower and dragged Wing Dagger under it, killing him, and accidentally injuring Tidal Wave. Both victims were soon reborn, however - Tidal Wave as Mirage, and Wing Dagger as the powerful Wing Saber. While Wing Saber merged with Optimus Prime as the Autobots ventured into Unicron, Shockblast defied Megatron's orders, lying and claiming he was under attack while sneaking off and preparing to make a power play. When Megatron faced off against Optimus Prime in the middle of an Energon reaction that had torn a fissure in space, Shockblast leaped into the middle, only to be hit by a chunk of debris and sent spiraling through the fissure, into a new region of space where Alpha Q had recreated the planets destroyed by Unicron.\n\nSeparated from the other Decepticons, Shockblast was confronted by the Autobots on Iron Planet and was defeated and captured by Wing Saber, and chained and guarded by Inferno. Megatron and the other Decepticons soon arrived to rescue him and Megatron warned him of the price of defiance. This did not stop Shockblast from attempting to seize power again, however - and in his next move, he succeeded, seating himself in Megatron's throne within Unicron, planning to take the chaos-bringer's power for his own. However, he got more power than he bargained for, as Unicron's essence possessed him, warping his body and driving him into an insane rage. Battling with Optimus Prime on Blizzard Planet, Shockblast was destroyed when Unicron's massive arm plunged down through the planet's atmosphere and crushed him, completely extinguishing his Spark.\n\nShockblast's place in the Decepticons was soon filled by his own younger and equally treacherous brother, Six Shot.\n\nShockblast would make his only comics appearance in the third promotional mini-comic packaged with \"Transformers: Energon\" toys. When Slugslinger and Sharkticon attempted to break into an Autobot island facility as Shockblast scrambled the security system with an electromagnetic pulse from orbit, they were caught and battled with Bulkhead and Towline who had some unexpected help—Omega Supreme, who soundly defeated all the Decepticons present.\n\nThe name of Shockwave would make an unexpected reappearance in the fourth mini-comic, as one of Megatron's troops. On Earth Megatron, with the aid of Snowcat, Shockwave, Mirage and Demolisher, cornered Optimus Prime and a wounded Hot Shot. Optimus nobly refused to give up. The other Autobot reinforcements were over ten minutes away and the two Autobots looked done for when Wing Saber arrived. Making a powerlinx link with Optimus Prime, Prime soundly defeated all the Decepticons, even Megatron, and forced them to flee. The Autobots then arrived and Optimus thanked Wing Saber for his help.\n\n\nThe Shockwave name returned to the \"Transformers\" toy line in the US as part of the \"\" series in 2005. Packaged with Tankor, a Mini-Con Autobot, Shockwave himself is of Decepticon allegiance and a member of the Sky Attack Team. Left free to pursue his own interests on Earth following the departure of the two other Transformer factions, Shockwave has spent the last decade working for various dictators and tyrants around the world. Who he signs up with is based on how likely he is to be able to cause devastation and death - because there's nothing he loves more than seeing a city go up in flames, and knowing he lit the fire.\n\nIn \"Balancing Act\" by Fun Publications Shockwave appears among the rebel Mini-Con forces who side with Megatron and attempt to sabotage the Mini-Con evacuation from one of Cybertron's moons.\n\nAccording to an interview with producer Tom DeSanto published in issue #15 of the \"Transformers Collectors Club Magazine\", the original lineup pitched for the Decepticons in the live action Transformers film consisted of Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Ravage, Laserbeak, Rumble, Skywarp, and Shockwave. However, Shockwave was left out of the original film as the lineup eventually ended up as Megatron, Starscream, Scorponok, Frenzy, Barricade, Bonecrusher, Blackout (who replaced Soundwave), and Brawl (misnamed Devastator).\n\nHe does appear in the third film, \"\". Actor David Warner was originally being considered for the role, but the part was ultimately given to Frank Welker, who also voices Soundwave after Corey Burton declined to return to the role. This marked the second time that Shockwave was voiced by an actor who also voiced Megatron, The Joker and Batman, that Corey Burton had previously voiced all three. Bay commented before the movie's release that Shockwave was going to be portrayed as a \"little bit more vicious\" than Megatron. He was considered to be a main villain but he ended up being as supporting villain in film. Shockwave is armed with a hand cannon, a multiple rocket launcher and a blade, and during the film he commands Driller, a massive and powerful Cybertonian animal.\n\nShockwave's design in the film retains most of his original features from the Generation 1 incarnation, most noticeably in his head design, hand cannon, and color scheme.\n\nFilm concept art of Sentinel Prime by artist Josh Nizzi named the character who would become Shockwave as Blitzwing.\n\nIn 2007 USA today polled people as to which Transformer they want to appear in the next Transformers film. Shockwave came in tied for fifth with Ultra Magnus.\n\nBryan Alexander of the Chicago Sun Times rated Shockwave 3rd of the top 12 most sinister movie villains in film for summer of 2011, being topped only by the Red Skull and Lord Voldemort.\n\nLongarm and Salvage are rescuing human workers at an oil plant disaster in Dalian, China when the Decepticons Shockwave and Astrotrain crash to Earth and kill them. Shockwave leaves Astrotrain and observes a group of Decepticons working for Starscream as they confront the Autobots. He traces the radioactive trail left by Starscream's minion Divebomb back to Starscream's base in junkyard of the outskirts of Mexico City. After blasting his way past Ruination and Deadlift, Shockwave tells Starscream that Megatron requires his services. Shockwave then sends Starscream to recover the drone called Brains. Shockwave, meanwhile, carves a path of destruction through the Autobot's base, slaughtering both Autobots and humans. Eventually he comes into conflict with Optimus Prime, who brutally beats him, angered by the death of his friends including Elita One. Shockwave is only saved by the arrival of his pet Driller.\n\nHe is responsible for the Tunguska event.\n\nShockwave does appear, however, in the tie-in \"\". He is a Triple Changer with a robot, gun turret, and AH-64 Apache helicopter modes and is a boss for the Autobots later in the game, where he must fight Optimus Prime. In the game, Shockwave delays Optimus Prime from rescuing Bumblebee when Bumblebee is captured by Sector 7. Physically, he is taller than Optimus Prime. Shockwave, however, appears to submit to Starscream, instead of the other way around like his G1 incarnation. He also appears in the Autobot Cybertron mission in the console versions of the game.\n\nIn the PSP version of the game, he is a playable character. He first appears with partner Thundercracker while trying to protect Blackout and Scorponok in Qatar. He next appears in the Arctic dig site, where he, Thundercracker and fellow Decepticon Dreadwing, try to find Megatron. They first destroy the Autobot transmitter satellites, then go inside the site. They are also attacked by several drones. They do not find Megatron and realize there is a satellite about to launch. The Autobot drones decide to blow up the place, but Thundercracker and Shockwave make it out, leaving Dreadwing to perish in the explosion. Then they go to the launch site, attempting to transmit a signal in the satellite for Decepticon drones to approach them. Shockwave distracts the armed forces while Thundercracker places the signal. They succeed, and Shockwave is rescued by Thundercracker. Shockwave meets with Blackout and Scorponok, but does not find their army and they have not heard from Thundercracker (Unknown to them, Autobot Ironhide already killed Thundercracker and Autobots Hound and Trailbreaker disrupted the signal). At the end of the game, after the Autobots succeed in destroying most of the Decepticons and bringing peace to Earth, Shockwave and Starscream retreat to Cybertron. Starscream and Shockwave argue about leadership now that Megatron is dead. They decide to go to war, with players assuming the role of Starscream. Starscream successfully destroys Shockwave and his followers.\n\nIn the Nintendo DS versions of the game (both Autobots and Decepticons) features all chopper vehicle modes that transform into a robot complete with Shockwave's head.\n\nShockwave appears as the final boss in the \"\" console game, set before the events of the film. Megatron sets out to free him from captivity in a Russian facility, destroying the cryo tanks keeping him frozen. Shockwave began to thaw as Optimus found him, and the driller attacked until Shockwave was active. However he was still sluggish, and this proved to be an advantage to Optimus, who attacked the power coils on his back powering his cannon, forcing Shockwave to take cover in the driller. After Optimus drove off the Driller again, Shockwave began fighting Optimus and several Autobot soldiers, taking the smaller robots with ease until Optimus used his flight-pack mode to finish the one-eyed Decepticon. Luckily for Shockwave, the driller returned and whisked him away. Arriving in Africa where Megatron, Starscream, and Soundwave were waiting. Megatron welcomed back his best assassin, and ordered him to head to Chernobyl as part of Operation: Pillar.\n\nShockwave first appeared during Optimus Prime's mission to Chernobyl with NEST troops. They had discovered a fuel cell from the \"Ark\" in an abandoned base. At that moment, Shockwave and his Driller - a massive multi-tentacled robotic animal - appear and immediately begin destroying the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and killing some of the soldiers in the process. They then proceed to take the fuel cell and burst out of the base with Optimus Prime following. The fight then takes to the land where the Driller knocks Optimus from his trailer, separating him from his weapons. However, Prime was still able to gain access to them and cut off one of the driller's tentacles to retrieve the fuel cell. At this moment Shockwave appears out of the beast and menacingly utters Prime's name, but he quickly withdraws.\n\nHe later appears during the final battle, where the Driller once again knocks over Optimus's trailer, and is attacked by the Wreckers so that the trailer could be retrieved. After noticing falling furniture from a building that Sam, Carly, Epps, and other soldiers are in, he sends the driller to collapse the building. After tipping the building over, Optimus Prime flies in with his jetpack and is able to kill the driller, cutting off its main head by flying through the section that connects it to the body. Angered by what happened to his pet, Shockwave shoots at Optimus with multiple rockets - causing him to fly out of control and get stuck in tangled tower crane wires. With Optimus out of the way, Shockwave and the Decepticons overpower the Autobots and prepare to execute them. After the Wreckers manage to free Optimus, they join the humans in a coordinated assault on Shockwave. He is eventually damaged badly, after getting temporarily blinded by parachutes before having an explosive detonated on his neck and then gets his eye partly shot out of his head by human soldiers, but he still refuses to fall. Optimus then flies in and attacks Shockwave, who fires a shell, but Optimus dodges it and punches through Shockwave's torso using bladed knuckles and kills him by completely ripping his eye out of his head. Optimus then uses Shockwave's hand cannon to blast the space bridge control pillar, temporarily halting Cybertron from transporting into Earth's atmosphere.\n\n\"Two-Heads\", two-headed human-made KSI Transformers, are modeled from the remains of Shockwave, and later become Decepticons under Galvatron's control in \"Transformers: Age of Extinction\". One Two-Head is killed by Hound, while another is killed when Optimus sets off one of Lockdown's grenades. A photo of Shockwave listing him as deceased is also seen.\n\nShockwave appears as a character in the .\n\nThe individual release of Shockwave this time in a Blue redeco.\n\nTranstech Shockwave received a full-page biography in issue #22 of the \"Transformers Collectors Club Magazine\". He used to work for the renegade Decepticon Jhiaxus as a scientist, but after Jhiaxus was destroyed was brought in by Megatron as a prisoner. Initially put on trial for war crimes he was freed by Megatron, who argued to Optimus Prime that Shockwave's mind would be an invaluable asset to them. Shockwave is a morally ambiguous Transtech with few actual weapons, in favor of a great number of in-built tools he uses for his craft.\n\nShockwave appeared in the 2008 BotCon voice actor play \"Bee in the City\", voiced by Chris Ho, also known as Vangelus. In this story Professor Sumdac attempted to create a teleportation system to get the Autobots to Cybertron, but an interaction with Sari Sumdac's key ended up transporting Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Sari to Transtech Cybertron, where they met Flareup and were detained by Shockwave. Bumblebee teamed up with \"Beast Wars\" Megatron to free his comrades, but then had to stop him from taking the key for himself. Afterwards the Autobots and Sari returned to their own dimension.\n\nTranstech Shockwave appeared in story \"Transcendent\", where he kidnapped Breakaway for Transtech Megatron. After Shockwave discovered that certain systems in Breakaway were unique and might be useful Megatron requested permission from \"Transtech\" Ratbat to take the Autobot apart, even it may kill him. When Alpha Trion's forces raided the lab to free Skyfall Megatron opposed them, but they escaped to another dimension.\n\nThis incarnation of Shockwave has the ability to change his body, using this power to assume the guise of Longarm in order to creep up the Autobot ranks and serve Megatron incognito. To further his guise, changing his actual G1 color scheme to a gray pattern, Shockwave provides his Longarm guise with an alt-mode like that of a burly rough terrain crane. His actual alt-mode is heavily based on the tank mode of \"Transformers Armada\"'s Megatron. Corey Burton reprises the English-accented, David Warner-inspired voice for the character, but when Shockwave is in the disguise of Longarm, he speaks in an American accent. Furthermore, while this Shockwave's voice sounds identical to that of his G1 self, Longarm's voice sounds much younger than Shockwave himself. Corey Burton revealed Shockwave's inclusion in Season 2 arose from a between scenes conversation he had with the production team, regarding how little the original Shockwave actually had to do.\n\nDuring Autobot training, his double-agent status was almost discovered by Bumblebee. But thanks to Bumblebee believing the spy to be Wasp, Shockwave managed to plant the evidence to have Wasp as his scapegoat. After successfully graduating from training, Longarm is eventually promoted to Prime rank, and made intel commander of Cybertron, allowing him full access to Autobot files, which he passes onto Megatron, who has him ensure Cybertron is left helpless as part of his master plan. In the two-part \"A Bridge Too Close\" episode, Shockwave informs Megatron that the Autobot who got the highest scores in the Space Bridge aptitude test is Bulkhead, leading Megatron to capture the Autobot. When the rest of the earth Autobots try to rescue Bulkhead, they are captured themselves, and Shockwave appears on a screen to taunt Bumblebee with the truth of his double agent status, and the fact that he had an innocent Autobot (Wasp) imprisoned (this later led to Wasp becoming Waspinator).\n\nAfter the \"A Bridge Too Close\" two-parter, he gained a more prominent role in Season 3, and returned in the season three premiere event \"Transwarped\". Appearing in his Longarm guise, he was waiting for Megatron's arrival until Blurr returned to Cybertron with information regarding Megatron's communications with the double agent. Once aware that no one else on Cybertron knows the truth yet, Shockwave attacks him and manages to use the base's walls to crush him, taking the remains to Cliffjumper for disposal before being contacted by Megatron. When Ultra Magnus planned on making contact with the earth Autobots, Shockwave uses his guise to convince him to have all communication with them relayed through him, to keep his identity a secret, which is further endangered when the council begins to realize there's a spy in their team.\n\nHe next appeared in \"Where is thy Sting?\", infuriated that Jazz, Sentinel Prime, and Jetstorm were heading to Earth while after Wasp and attempting to get them to turn back, with Ultra Magnus \"calming\" him to let his group proceed with their mission. Fearing that his cover will be blown and unable to contact Megatron, Shockwave left a message for him that he would take matters into his own hands. At the episode's conclusion, once word of the truth came to Cybertron, Ironhide attempted to take him into prison, only to find the gravely injured Ultra Magnus lying on the floor, as Shockwave nearly assassinated him and stole his hammer before taking his leave into the long abandoned underground passageways to hide out.\n\nHe appeared in \"This is Why I Hate Machines\". When Megatron arrived to Cybertron in Omega Supreme, Shockwave began setting up a scheme to acquire the activation codes to Omega Supreme from the original Autobot who possessed them, Arcee. His plans were slowed down when Ratchet and Captain Fanzone arrived on Cybertron and try to protect Arcee from the clutches of Shockwave. Because of this, Shockwave battled Ratchet several times through the episode, utilizing the stolen Magnus Hammer as his primary weapon. After taking care of the Autobot, he encounters his \"old boss\", Ultra Magnus and attempts to put him out of commission. He would have succeeded if Ratchet had not intervened. Though he lost Magnus' hammer in the fight, Shockwave escapes with Arcee, resuming his natural purple color scheme upon joining Megatron's group officially.\n\nIn the third-season finale (which also acted as the series' finale), Shockwave kept Arcee in an operating chamber, where he hooked her up to several wires. Once he received news that Megatron was going to make Omega Supreme clones, Shockwave once again used his Longarm disguise in an attempt to trick Arcee into giving Megatron Omega's activation codes, so that the three Omega clones could be brought online. When the attempt failed, Shockwave took the codes forcefully. However, the codes were missing an essential security patch, requiring Shockwave to set up a bypass, leaving Lugnut to control the clones remotely from Omega. Shockwave later encountered Ratchet, Bumblebee, Bulkhead, and Sari, who had come to save Arcee, and engaged Bumblebee and Bulkhead in battle. Bulkead managed to catch him off guard, punching him to the ground and knocking away his cannon. Forgetting his color scheme, Shockwave took on his Longarm guise in a vain and desperate ploy to gain mercy. Bulkhead and Bumblebee were not fooled however and destroyed the cannon. Shockwave makes a final appearance in the show when he gets taken to Cybertron as a prisoner along with Megatron and Lugnut.\n\nAfter the events of the animated series Shockwave was placed in detention at the Trypticon stronghold in Kaon city.\n\n\nShockwave started out as Megatron's pet \"mad scientist\" during his days as a gladiator.\n\nAppears in the novel \"Transformers: Exodus\". Shockwave is responsible for creating the Insecticons, and creating the combiner technology - first the Combaticons who formed Bruticus Maximus and perfected it with the Constructicons who formed Devastator (named after the Devastator Winds).\n\nHe is also mentioned in \"\", where he continues to lead the Decepticon effort to subjugate Cybertron in Megatron's absence. He communicates and meets with Alpha Trion several times, always seeking to intimidate the ancient archivist, only to be rebuffed. Militarily, his greatest opposition comes from the Wreckers under Ultra Magnus.\n\nShockwave later appears in \"\", where he captures Alpha Trion in order to gain access to the supercomputer Vector Sigma, so that he may be able to create a Decepticon Matrix of Leadership. Somehow, the Curator, a Quintesson leader, manipulated Shockwave's motives of finding Vector Sigma, in order to rebuild the Space Bridges so that the Quintessons may take over Cybertron.\n\nShockwave appears as second-in-command in the 2010 video game \"\". While voiced by Steven Blum in the game, Shockwave was voiced by Corey Burton in the GameStop TV promo. Players can unlock him on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions by entering a unique code supplied by GameStop (U.S.) and Blockbuster Video (UK). He is also unlockable on the Nintendo DS version and part of the first DLC pack on the PC version.\n\nIn the TV promo, Megatron leaves Shockwave in charge while he is away. Shockwave revels in this, then orders to transform into boombox mode and play \"The Touch\" while shooting several Autobots. (who is nearby) asks \"Why this song?\", to which Shockwave replies, \"When your hit percentage exceeds mine, you may choose the soundtrack.\"\n\nShockwave appeared in \"\" where he has a larger role. Shockwave opens a space bridge to search the universe for energy to rebuild Cybertron. He soon finds dinosaurs on Earth and later he appllied these forms to a group of Autobots on Cybertron with Grimlock being one of them and calls them Dinobots. Shockwave later tries to control the new Dinobots by reducing their intelligence in favor of combat prowess, but they are still intelligent enough to rebel against him. Grimlock even bites off Shockwave's left arm during their battle for control of the space bridge, a reference to the original Shockwave's lack of a left arm, which is replaced by a cannon. Shockwave is presumed dead after Grimlock knocks him away. Even if Grimlock did not kill him, both Grimlock and Shockwave are likely dead from the destruction of the space bridge. It is not confirmed that they died by any means.\n\nA flashback in the \"Transformers: Prime\" episode \"Out of the Past\" showed that Shockwave was in Kaon when Starscream was delivering energon to him. Starscream brought Arcee and Cliffjumper to Shockwave in order for him to extract the cryptic Autobot message from them. When asked by Starscream if he can extract the Autobot message from them, Shockwave stated to Starscream that he invented Cortical Psychic Patch. Shockwave successfully extracts the message from Arcee where it involved Optimus Prime giving the coordinates to Earth. When Shockwave plans to dispose of Cliffjumper, Starscream tells Shockwave that Cliffjumper is his. Shockwave acknowledges Starscream's orders and leaves. Arcee and Cliffjumper learn from Starscream that Shockwave is using the Energon to build a Space Bridge. Upon taking out two Vehicon guards, Arcee and Cliffjumper discover that Shockwave plans to use the Space Bridge to send the Decepticons to Earth to attack Optimus Prime before any other Autobot arrives. Shockwave arrives when Cliffjumper tries to distract the two Vehicon guards and attacks Arcee while she is sabotaging the Space Bridge. Cliffjumper then attacks Shockwave as Arcee takes out some Vehicons. Before Shockwave can shoot Cliffjumper, Arcee shoots part of a ceiling which knocks out Shockwave. When Shockwave tries to follow them, Arcee manages to shoot Shockwave in the head as Arcee and Cliffjumper successfully arrive on Earth. Before leaving to find Optimus Prime, Arcee and Cliffjumper are left wondering if Shockwave survived the Space Bridge's explosion.\n\nIn the third season entitled Beast Hunters, Knock Out finds Shockwave when he, some Vehicons, and some Insecticons were looking for the Iacon relics at the destroyed Omega Lock. He survived the Space Bridge explosion, but was lost on Cybertron and no Decepticons searched for him. He decided to use his time alone to move along with a lot of his projects until he saw the Decepticon search party and returned to Earth with Knock Out. After hearing Starscream's excuse why he wasn't looked for, he found his excuse logical. With Shockwave's return, Megatron established a new chain of command. While Starscream remained Megatron's second-in-command in terms of military activities, Shockwave became Megatron's second-in-command for scientific activities. While hunting Autobots with the Decepticons, Shockwave recommends one of his projects for it, a Predacon named Predaking who was under his control. Shockwave sends Predaking after the Autobots with some Energon from Wheeljack leaked during torture. But unfortunately the Predacon failed and Starscream made fun of the mute creature. Shockwave was present when Starsream was sending the decepticons to different parts of the globe. He later suggested to release Predaking on the Autobot intruders. But after that failed Shockwave decided to handle it himself. He managed to subdue Wheeljack and Bulkhead. He was later about to execute the Autobot prisoners until he got distracted by Optimus Prime's return. After the Autobots escaped, he returns to the Nemesis through the groundbridge sent by Soundwave before the remains of Darkmount fell on him.\n\nIn \"Project Predacon,\" it was revealed that Shockwave once used his previous clones of Predacons to Earth back in ancient times. Optimus Prime discovers that the Decepticons are looking for fossil samples of the Predacons so that Shockwave can rebuild his Predacon army. Shockwave also had his Predacons microchipped, which made it easy to track their remains. When it came to one location, Shockwave ended up engaging Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Smokescreen. With help from Soundwave, Shockwave was able to obtain part of a Predacon fossil. While analyzing the Predacon fossil fragment, Shockwave is visited by Megatron who states that he heard of his encounter with Optimus Prime and how it would've been tragic if he had lost his best scientist in battle. Shockwave vows to Megatron that he will leave the fossil-fetching missions to Starscream and the Vehicons so that he can accelerate Project Predacon.\n\nIn \"Evolution\", it is revealed that Project: Predacon is nearing completion. After having Knock Out transport the synthetic energon to him, Shockwave finds that Predaking has learned to transform after Starscream angers him. He is present when Megatron orders Project: Predacon to be shut down before the Predacons can rebel. Shockwave surprisingly finds Megatron's decision to be logical. When Starscream puts his plan of having the Autobots destroy the Predacon clones without alerting Shockwave, Shockwave escapes the Wreckers, but first releases the Predacons which are later destroyed. He reports to Megatron later when he discovers freshly made Cybertronian alloy in his destroyed lab. He concludes that synthetic energon was the cause of what has transpired.\n\nIn \"Minus One\" and \"Synthesis\", Shockwave is working on the reconstruction of the Omega Lock, and the manufacturing of the synthetic energon. He finds the formula difficult to complete, and has Laserbeak retrieve Soundwave after he's captured, and bring Ratchet to the Nemesis. The two scientists end up working together to complete the cybermatter formula.\n\nIn the series finale \"Deadlock\", Shockwave is about to use the Omega Lock on Earth, but Ratchet attacks, and Shockwave easily defeats him, then the other Autobots arrive and Shockwave ends up being knocked down by Bumblebee. After Megatron is killed by Bumblebee, Starscream is distraught and swears vengeance on the Autobots, but Shockwave tries to calm him down and forces him and the other Decepticons to presumably head for Kaon. They then get into an escape pod and launch, landing somewhere on Cybertron.\n\nIn the movie, Shockwave and Starscream are the leaders of the Decepticons, and continue to relocate again and again to avoid detection from the Autobots. Together they revive Project Predacon, and have made two Predacons, Darksteel and Skylynx. Starscream later summons Shockwave to Predaking's grounds, where he has located many Predacon bones unearthed by the restoration of Cybertron. While they gather the bones, Unicron in Megatron's body comes over, and resurrects the dead Predacons with dark energon. Starscream runs but Shockwave attempts to fight off the zombies in tank mode, but is overrun and mauled by them. Later, when Predaking defeats his Predacon brethren, Shockwave is shown to have survived, and asks the Predacons to use their power more logically. It is unknown how he survived, or what happens to him afterwards.\n\n\nShockwave is a Decepticon whose skills are at relations between organisms, working as the ambassador between Earth and the Decepticons,along with both his ally and aid Fistfight. Calm, wizened, he's intelligent and patient, though no scientist. Like most Decepticons, he's more than willing to put his life on the line to save humans. Although his fighting techniques are entirely defensive, he's more than capable of putting a hole through any Autobot.\n\nIn his alternate identity, Longarm, he is an Autotrooper officer. He was always kind of a wet blanket, but recently he's been acting really strangely and disappearing for long stretches of time without explanation. He's even started saying stuff like \"Interrogative\" and \"Conclusion\" before his sentences.\n\nShockwave's body is based on \"\" Shockblast. According to Trent Troop, his colors were chosen because they were the opposite of \"Generation 1\" Shockwave's.\n\nShockwave's ability to disguise himself as Longarm is a homage to \"Transformers Animated\" Shockwave, who infiltrated the Autobot ranks as Longarm. Longarm is a disguised Shockwave, but \"which\" Shockwave is still unrevealed.\n\nAfter mistaking Cliffjumper for his universe's Cliffjumper, Megatron mistakenly believed that his time in the Rad Zone had damaged his circuitry, and noted that perhaps they should have Shockwave take a look at him.\n\nWhen the Decepticons got a two-way Stellar Spanner going between Earth and Cybertron, Megatron assigned Shockwave to Earth as an ambassador. Shockwave arrived at the base on Earth and was greeted by Starscream and Professor Arkeville. He was particularly interested in talking to Cliffjumper, and hearing more about Primus. Shockwave attended the unveiling of the Mega-Rig, aiming to meet R.J. Blackrock and Senator Shore. When a group of Autobots attacked the ceremony, Shockwave acted only in defense. The human Sephie Beller came under threat from Seaspray, and Shockwave acted quickly, taking the missile which would surely have killed her.\n\nThough he was seriously damaged, he survived and was taken back to base for repairs. Sephie blamed herself for his injuries and got herself upgraded with Cybertronian technology. Though the other Decepticons didn't approve of it, Starscream's scans of her tech provided several vital tips to boost Shockwave's self-repair, saving his life. He was soon on his feet, albeit unsteadily, and greeted Sephie when the Decepticons brought her back to base.\n\nShockwave is one of the Decepticons that appeared in \"\".\n\nThe text from Marvel Comics section of the Wikipedia article for Shockwave was used of the back of the box for the Chinese toy company Cloud 9 on the toy they call Quakeblast, whose design is inspired by Shockwave.\n"}

One of the earliest of the Stuart Court masques, staged when the new dynasty had been in power less than a year and was closely engaged in peace negotiations with Spain, \"The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses\" stood as a precedent and a pattern for the many masques that followed during the next four decades.\n\nThe name of the masque's designer is not recorded in the historical sources; some scholars have argued that he may have been Inigo Jones, who had recently returned to England from the royal court of Anne's brother Christian IV of Denmark, and so had a connection with her courtly establishment. The stage set had clear similarities with Jones's later masque work; the set for \"The Vision\" consisted of a large mountain, plus a Temple of Peace and a Cave of Sleep at the opposite end of the hall.\n\nDaniel's text draws on classical mythology. The presenters are Iris, the Graces, a Sybil, and personifications of Night and Sleep. (These speaking roles were taken by boys and men who were not aristocrats but lower Court functionaries. Aristocratic participants in Court masques generally did not take speaking roles.) The musicians who played cornets were dressed as satyrs.\n\nIn the masque, Night appears and awakens her son, Sleep, who calls forth a vision for the spectators with his wand (and promptly goes back to sleep). Iris appears at the top of the artificial mountain, and descends to the Temple of Peace, where she tells the Sybil about the coming of the goddesses. The Graces appear on the mountaintop and descend to the floor below, followed by twelve goddesses, descending three by three, to the music of the satyrs. Each goddess is followed by a torchbearer, dressed in white with gold stars. The dozen aristocrats parade to the Temple of Peace as the Graces sing; the main dances ensue.\n\nThe performance featured Anne of Denmark, the queen consort of King James I, and eleven of the queen's ladies in waiting. They were attired as classical goddesses and danced in the masque; the Queen, curiously, did not take the obvious role of Juno, queen of the gods, but rather Pallas Athena. The dozen noble participants and their roles were:\n\n\nThe ladies' costumes were sumptuous: \"Juno\" wore a \"sky-colored mantle\" embroidered with gold and peacock feathers, with a crown also of gold; \"Diana\" was dressed a \"green mantle\" embroidered with silver half moons, \"with a croissant of pearls on her head.\" The costumes were created by ransacking the wardrobe of the dead Queen Elizabeth, who had left some 500 gowns behind her when she died, many of them luxurious, some worn only once. These supplied cloth of silver and cloth of gold for the goddesses' garb.\n\nEven with this frugality, the masque cost between two and three thousand pounds to stage. Lady Penelope Rich reportedly wore £20,000 worth of jewels while appearing the masque – though she was outdone by the Queen, who sported fully £100,000 in gems. (This kind of extreme display became characteristic of the courtly masques during the Stuart era, and was a focus of controversy and deep disapproval by wide segments of the public.) Anne carried a spear and wore a helmet and a tunic, embroidered with cannon and weapons of war, which ended just below the knee, quite an innovation for the time. As courtly humorist Dudley Carleton put it, \"her clothes were not so much below the knee but that we might see a woman had both feet and legs which I never knew before.\"\n\nAttendance at the masque was highly coveted, and grew to be a bone of contention among the Court's foreign ambassadors – another element that would become typical of future masques. The competition was so intense that the French ambassador, the Comte de Beaumont, actually threatened to kill his Spanish counterpart De Tassis in the King's presence if he couldn't attend.\n\nDaniel's text for the masque was published in a 1604 quarto by the bookseller Edward Allde. This was an unauthorised and defective printing; Daniel countered it with an authorised and accurate octavo edition in the same year, issued by the stationer Simon Waterson. That edition bears Daniel's dedication of the work to his patroness Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, who had recommended him to Queen Anne for the commission; the dedication, at 210 lines, is the longest in English Renaissance drama. The text was reprinted in quarto in 1623.\n\nDaniel did well from the masque; he was made, firstly, a Groom of the Queen's Chamber and later a chamberlain; and the Queen gave him the job of licensing plays for the Children of the Chapel, the troupe of child actors that Anne had just taken into her patronage as the Children of the Queen's Revels. His ascendancy was brief, however: later in 1604 Daniel got into trouble with the Privy Council over a performance of his play \"Philotas,\" which was seen as a too-friendly commentary on the Essex rebellion of 1601. Daniel bowed out of further masque-writing for the Court – though commentators wonder how voluntary his action was. Ben Jonson quickly took over as the principal (though not the sole) masque writer for the Stuarts. Daniel did make one more venture in masquing prior to his 1619 death; he composed \"Tethys' Festival\" for its summer 1610 performance.\n\n"}

Like their contemporaries The Last Poets, the group combined elements of jazz music and spoken-word performance, making the trio one that is often seen as a forerunner of contemporary hip-hop music. Formed in 1967, the group comprised Richard Dedeaux, Father Amde Hamilton (born Anthony Hamilton), and Otis O'Solomon (also billed as Otis O'Solomon Smith) (O'Solomon removed the \"Smith\" from his name in the 1970s).\n\nHamilton, O'Solomon, and Dedeaux first met and collaborated at the Watts Writers Workshop, an organization created by Budd Schulberg in the wake of the Watts Riots, as the Civil Rights Movement was beginning to take a new cultural turn. Fusing music with jazz and funk roots, and rapid-fire, spoken-word poetry, they created a sound that gave them a considerable local following. They released two albums, 1969's \"The Black Voices: On the Streets in Watts\" and 1971's \"Rappin' Black in a White World\", which established a strong tendency toward social commentary and a reputation for militancy. The group was unable to secure another record deal; a promising deal with Bob Marley's Tuff Gong label fell through after his passing. Unable to sustain success, the group has performed only sporadically since the mid-1970s.\n\nIn recent years, the group's profile has improved somewhat. The 1997 recording, \"When the 90's Came\", found them in the studio with pianist Horace Tapscott, and a European tour reunited the trio with former collaborator DeeDee McNeil. In 2005, \"Things Gonna Get Greater: The Watts Prophets 1969-1971\" combined the group's first two efforts, bringing them back into print for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nAmde Hamilton, who is a priest of the ancient Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church can be seen performing a spoken-word piece at the 1981 funeral service of Bob Marley in Jamaica in the 1982 film \"Land of Look Behind\". Hamilton was the third American to be ordained as a priest of the ancient Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.\n\nIn 1994, the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD, \"\", appearing on a track entitled \"Apprehension\" alongside Don Cherry. The album, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic in African-American society was named \"Album of the Year\" by \"Time Magazine\".\n\nRichard Dedeaux died in December 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

Through affiliates in twenty five countries, it operates radio and television stations and publishes and broadcasts Bob Gass's free daily devotionals The Word for You Today and word4u2day.\n\nThe group was started in New Zealand by Richard Berry. In the early 1960s, the Christchurch evangelical was inspired by Ecuadorian Christian short-wave radio station HCJB to set up a radio station in his garage. The station became a permanent operation in 1976, and in subsequent years it expanded throughout New Zealand.\n\nThe Rhema model was used to establish UCB affiliates in Australia, the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth countries, and beyond. In July 2010, UCB United Kingdom's UCB TV partnered with the mobile TV and video on demand network Yamgo to launch the world's first ever live Christian mobile TV channel.\n\nThe Word For You Today is a free, daily devotional written by Bob Gass and distributed internationally by United Christian Broadcasters as a daily radio programme, as website content, as an email newsletter and as quarterly print editions. One million copies of the United Kingdom and Ireland print edition are distributed each quarter to hospitals, rest homes, care facilities and UCB supporters. Other regional editions are distributed to subscribers, churches and Christian organisations in other parts of the world.\n\nBob Gass has described the devotionals as \"a kick start for cold mornings, when you don't feel like reading your Bible or find it a bit dry\". He started writing The Word for Today devotional readings in 1992 as various inspirations he had received in forty years of being involved in Christian leadership and from the Biblical principles instilled in him by his mother. After positive response in the United States, he offered international rights to the devotionals to United Christian Broadcasters CEO Gareth Littler, with a successful first print run of 3500 copies in 1994 being distributed to UCB supporters in the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing requests and planning, a contemporary youth version, \"The Word 4U 2Day\", was introduced in August 2003 in conjunction with Manchester Christian youth ministry The Message Trust. About 250,000 copies of the United Kingdom and Ireland print edition are distributed quarterly. The version is distributed by UCB youth stations as a radio programme and website content.\n\nUCB United Kingdom is a registered charity and the country's largest Christian media company. It aims to broadcast quality Christian radio programming, provide practical and insightful Christian television, and act as a support ministry for Christians. In pursuit of this it operates broadcast networks, publishes The Word For Today and Word For You, operates the prayer support call centre UCB Prayerline and provides accredited industry training.\n\nThe company is based in Stoke-on-Trent. It did its initial broadcasts via Manx Radio in the Isle of Man, although this gave limited geographical reach and only from 10 pm until 2 am, it did allow the station to bypass some of the UK's broadcasting laws and commence transmission earlier in the company's lifetime than would have otherwise been possible.\n\nUCB Media broadcasts Christian radio stations UCB 1 and 2 via National DAB, via their free Smartphone app, UCB Player as well as via their website and tunein. They also run a Christian television station UCB TV available online and via the UCB Player. They previously broadcast on Sky and Virgin Media, but all UCB-branded channels on both platforms (except UCB Ireland) were removed on 1 July 2015.\n\nUCB UK is broadcast nationally across the UK with a format of entertainment, the latest Christian music, news and current affairs, as well as thought-provoking interviews and discussions.\n\nPresenters include Steve Best (breakfast), Paul Hammond (mornings), Gareth Cottrell (afternoons), Rebecca Millington (drive), Sarah Hine (evenings), Catherine Ball(weekends), Vicky Gibbens (weekends).

The station also features specialist music shows such as 'Rock On' two hours of hard rock and metal and 'Beats' an hour of dance and electronica. UCB Extra is available online or on mobile devices via UCB and third party apps.\n\nChristian television station UCB TV was available via the Eutelsat 28A satellite on Sky Digital channel 584 and online via TVPlayer.

It now broadcasts via their UCB Player app and Website as an online only station.\n\nUCB provide a confidential telephone service called UCB Prayerline with trained Christian volunteers who pray for callers' issues over the telephone. The service is supported by churches from across the United Kingdom, manned 7 days a week and receives around 100,000 calls per year. A parallel service, the Forces Prayerline, was started in Germany in 2005 and extended to the UK on 6 November 2008 at St Clement Danes Church, London, on the occasion of the annual Armed Forces Day of Prayer. This service supports servicemen, servicewomen and their families at home and abroad.\n\nRhema Media is the founding organisation of United Christian Broadcasting. It is also New Zealand's largest Christian media organisation, broadcasting four radio networks and a television station, and publishing the quarterly The Word for You Today devotional publication, from the Rhema Broadcasting Centre on Upper Queen Street in the central Auckland suburb of Newton.\n\nThe group's flagship network, New Zealand's Rhema, is an evangelical contemporary Christian radio network started in 1978. The initial programme/station manager, John McNeil, laid the groundwork for what became the network's relaxed talk and music format, in which a limited number of teaching programmes are intermingled with music, news and interviews.\n\nOther stations include Southern Star, which plays classic contemporary Christian music and hymns, Life FM, a contemporary Christian hit radio network, and The Word, which broadcasts Bible readings. Rhema Media also operate Christian television channel Shine TV, which is available on Sky Television. UCB International previously owned, but never utilised, a network of New Zealand UHF stations now used by Prime TV.\n\nVision Christian Media (formerly UCB Australia) operates the nationwide network \"Vision Christian Radio\", (previously called Vision Radio Network and Vision FM). It also publishes \"The Word for Today\" and \"word4U2day\", coordinates the \"Vision Christian Prayer\" prayer ministry and provides mailorder Christian resource service \"Vision Christian Store\". It was featured in the Andrew Denton documentary film God on My Side. Vision's motto is \"Connecting Faith to Life\" and the radio network aims to make Christian Radio available for every Australian as a means to that end.\n\nAs at the close of 2008, Vision operated on over 360 licences, including low powered services in metropolitan suburbs and rural towns. It also operated some higher powered services in some regional areas and in Western Melbourne on 1611 AM. By mid 2015, Vision had expanded to over 600 relay stations, mainly LPON licences (low power open narrowcast) but also including Adelaide 1611 AM. Vision's talk and music programming is aimed at \"unpacking\" what it means to follow Jesus Christ in an understandable way.\n\nVision began broadcasting from small studios in Springwood, Brisbane, Australia on 1 February 1999. A few years later they moved into larger premises in nearby Underwood to better provide a 24-hour 7-day broadcast to some 300+ relay stations across the nation, plus listeners on the Internet and via satellite. Vision has been able to acquire over 600 high- and low-powered open narrowcast licenses and has quickly gone about the task of setting up a national network of relay stations across Australia, from the largest cities to regional centres and tiny isolated towns in the bush.\n\nMany small to medium-sized country towns in Australia have benefited from the cost-effective approach of using low-powered FM transmitters. Although typically only one to ten watts, they usually give quite adequate residential coverage in small towns, depending on the antenna height above local terrain. The setup cost is very achievable for most communities and the ongoing cost is minimal due to low maintenance equipment with low power consumption – some even use solar power in remote areas.\n\nIn the twelve months following March 2001 a rapid expansion began, seeing the number of relay stations 'on-air' triple from around 30 to 90. Also in April 2001, Vision introduced Australia's first nationwide news service from a Christian perspective. Vision's News service is heard across their own network, as well as being accessed by a growing number of community stations who don't have the resources to produce their own news content. During 2003 Vision had opportunity to secure its first high powered open narrowcast licences, which were soon put on air.\n\nThe network quickly reached 150 relay stations by the end of 2003, and in the following year would see its first foray into AM radio sites in Shepparton, Bunbury and Kalgoorlie. Just prior to Christmas 2004 a further 17 High Powered licences were secured to be on air the following year. Vision's 200th relay station was powered up on Australia Day 2005 at the Central Australian town of Yulara – right next to Uluru (Ayers Rock). Yarrawonga in Victoria had the honour of station number 300 in late 2007 and a significant development occurred in late 2008 with the unexpected acquisition of a medium powered AM service in Melbourne (1611AM).\n\nIn Makati, Philippines, United Christian Broadcasters operates an Internet radio station \"The Edge Media\" in partnership with the Asian Seminary of Christian Ministries and Century Broadcasting Network, a subsidiary of Century Communications Marketing Center Inc. (CMCCI). The station is an advocate for a Christian worldview and is used as a training ground for students from 15 Asian nations to learn how to open low cost stations in their countries. It plays contemporary Christian music including pop, hip hop, alternative, praise and gospel songs. It plays music from a wide range of Christian artists of various nationalities, including local contemporary Christian artists which fit its format.\n\nIn Ontario, Canada, United Christian Broadcasters' Canadian affiliate operates 6 stations.\n\nOn 5 December 2014, the CRTC approved a new UCB outlet on 90.5 FM in Windsor, Ontario (CJAH-FM), which will broadcast at 1730 watts (10,000 watts maximum ERP). CJAH-FM would begin testing on 19 October 2017 and is expected to be launched 2 December 2017.\n\n"}
{"id": "5501075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5501075", "title": "Yowie (chocolate)", "text": "Yowie (chocolate)\n\nYowie is a confectionery and publishing brand originating in Australia in 1995 by Cadbury and Kidcorp. It was one of the top selling chocolates in Australia in the late 1990s and early 2000s, selling over a million units a week.\nAfter a break of nearly a decade, Yowie relaunched in 2014 for US markets.\n\nYowie began as the brainchild of English-born advertising man, illustrator and author Geoff Pike. After serving in the navy, Pike jumped ship in Australia, finding work as a jackaroo on remote cattle stations. He became enchanted by Australia’s outback and its unique wildlife, and devoted his free time to nursing injured and orphaned animals back to health.\n\nMany decades later, after a successful career in advertising, Pike drew on these early bush experiences and his love of wild places to create the Yowie Kingdom, a fictional magical realm free of the destructive influence of humanity, where threatened wildlife finds a safe haven. \n\nInspired by Australian folklore, Pike borrowed the mythical man-like creature the Yowie, reputed to roam the Australian bush. To watch over the fictional Yowie Kingdom and its animals and plants, Pike created six Yowie characters, each related to a well-known Australian animal, and each one guardian of key wild habitats:\n\n\nAdditional characters included animal companions for each of the six Yowie and Balthizar the Bunyip, ruler of the Yowie Kingdom. To represent the threats facing the world’s natural habitats and threatened species, Pike created the Grumkin, careless creatures constantly seeking to destroy the harmony of the Yowie Kingdom. The Grumkins were: Munch (careless building, enemy of Rumble), Blob (pollution, enemy of Crag), Ooz (also pollution, enemy of Squish), Spark (careless firelighting, enemy of Nap), Slob (littering, enemy of Ditty) and Chomp the Tiger Toothed Tree Chomper (deforestation, enemy of Boof).\n\nContinuing with the development of the Yowie concept and characters, Pike enlisted the aid of long-time friend, fellow advertising man and best-selling author Bryce Courtenay. They hit upon the idea of a confectionery product as a vehicle for Yowie, and in 1994 pitched the concept to confectionery giant Cadbury. \n\nAfter three years developing the characters and the manufacturing process, in 1997 Cadbury launched Yowie as a foil-wrapped character-shaped milk chocolate shell containing a plastic capsule. Within the capsule was a multi-part collectable model of a native Australian or New Zealand animal, together with a leaflet featuring information, a photo of the animal and assembly instructions for the collectable. The first series featured 50 animals, plus figurines of each of the six Yowie characters. \n\nCadbury Yowie was selling over one million units weekly and in its first year sold 2.5 Yowies for every man, woman and child in Australia. The brand won multiple industry awards in Australia and internationally, including Best Global Supermarket Product and Best Global Confectionery Product at the 1997 Sial international food industry awards in Paris. \n\nA Yowie collector scene soon emerged with collector clubs forming across Australia and New Zealand and websites devoted to displaying and swapping Yowie collectables.\n\nCadbury Yowie was also released in Singapore, Japan and the UK.\n\nTo coincide with the release of Cadbury Yowie, a series of Yowie books was released, telling the stories of the Yowie characters as they protect their domains from the threat of the Grumkin. Written by Geoff Pike and Bryce Courtenay and illustrated by award-winning artists Christopher Minos and Helen Steele, the series sold more than 2 million copies, topping the Australian best-seller lists for children’s books. \n\nNumerous lines of Yowie merchandise were produced, including soft toys, clothing, games, activity books, and Yowie music CDs.\n\nFollowing the success of the first series of Yowie collectables, a second series was released in 1998, this time featuring 50 new animals.\n\nThe third series of Yowie, released in early 1999, was composed of 50 figurines and 6 limited edition mini Grumkins. This series remained the most common of all the series, extending into 2002, with further scattered releases until the series ended in 2005.\n\nThe fourth series was released in late 1999 and featured ‘Yowie World’ collectables, with animals from beyond Australia and New Zealand, as well as 6 limited edition crystal Yowies, 6 ‘Yowie playmates’ and a Lord Balthizzar figurine. It remained the second-most popular series, extending until 2005.\n\nIn 2000, Yowie teamed up with the Australian Museum to create Yowie and the Lost Kingdoms, the series of collectables featuring extinct animals from around the world and across the geological ages, including dinosaurs and other reptiles as well as extinct Australian megafauna. The Lost Kingdoms series was based on illustrations by Dr Anne Musser of the Australian Museum and masterminded by the director of the museum Dr Michael Archer. The museum presented an exhibition of fossils and reconstructions linking to the series. Additionally, the packaging got overhauled so that the wrappers of the Lost Kingdoms Yowies could be distinguished by the sign and shovel being held in their paws. \n\nSeries A had 50 prehistoric figurines and 6 limited edition skulls. It was later replaced by Series B, released in 2001, which had 30 figurines and 6 limited edition glow-in-the-dark dinosaurs. In 2002 the third and final series, Series C, was released, with 30 figurines and 6 limited edition dazzling dinosaurs.\n\nIn 2001, Yowie Adventures was released, based around comic-strip stories in which the Yowie and their friends save endangered animals from the onslaught of the Grumkin. The series had 30 figurines, and was often regarded as the rarest series,considering supplies seemed limited. It is the most highly sought-after series of all Yowies. The series consisted of 6 animals, 6 enemies, 6 \"yurts\", 6 helpers and 6 transports. The series was updated in 2002 with a second release with 30 figurines, similar to the previous series, except more animals appeared in this series and the Yowie and helpers were replaced with Grumkins and helpers.\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, Yowie Forgotten Friends was released.
