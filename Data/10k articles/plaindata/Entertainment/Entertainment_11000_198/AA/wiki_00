It was to be produced and financed by Parallel Media. In a 2010 interview, Jodorowsky said that the film had \"dragged a long time\" and suggested that Abel Cain will not feature any \"stars\", adding that he would cast his son Axel Jodorowsky in the lead role just as he did in his 1989 cult classic film \"Santa Sangre\".\n\nIt was expected to be released sometime between late 2011 to 2012, but appears to be shelved so that he may shoot his biopic, \"The Dance of Reality\" first. In a November 29 interview, Jodorowsky announced that he had found financing for the film and would begin shooting the project in September in Mexico after he is finished with \"The Dance of Reality\".\n\nDuring an interview at the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, Jodorowsky announced his plans to finally make \"The Son of El Topo\" as soon as financial backing is obtained. Also in 2016 the sequel to \"El Topo\" was released in comic book form as \"Sons of El Topo\" (the original title for the project), in a miniseries written by Jodorowsky and illustrated by José Ladrönn.\n\nAfter a nuclear apocalypse, the whole landscape is a desert ruin, except for a small island paradise where El Topo is buried. Though visible and seemingly accessible, every attempt to enter this island has resulted in disaster. El Topo's sons, Cain and Abel, were separated as boys because El Topo predicted that Cain would kill Abel. But when evil marauders steal their mothers's body in an attempt to trick their way into the island, the brothers join forces to deliver their dead mother to be buried with their father. Not only must they overcome an enemy adept at technological witchery, they must overcome the curse that marks their destiny.\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky began attempting to resurrect his film career in the mid-nineties after becoming disillusioned with the business during his poor experience on \"The Rainbow Thief\" and attempted to market a sequel to his classic \"El Topo\", and created a teaser poster. Originally \"Sons of El Topo\" was to star Marilyn Manson and Johnny Depp, but the funding never materialized and Jodorowsky shortly abandoned the project.\n\nJodorowsky next attempted to make a \"metaphysical gangster film\" entitled \"King Shot\", which was to be produced by David Lynch and star Marilyn Manson and Nick Nolte. He drew numerous conceptual sketches and heavily marketed the film to producers, but eventually he and Lynch abandoned the project after they were only able to acquire a portion of the budget necessary to shoot the film and Jodorowsky was given another opportunity to make his \"dream project\".\n\nIn a November 2009 interview with \"The Guardian\", Jodorowsky revealed that he had stopped trying to make \"King Shot\", but had finally been given financing for the sequel to \"El Topo\" by some \"Russian producers\" who own Parallel Media films.\n\n"}

The country's best result in the contest is a second-place finish for Dami Im in . Australia also finished in the top ten in two of its other appearances in the contest, with Guy Sebastian finishing fifth in 2015, and Isaiah Firebrace finishing ninth in .\n\nAustralia's participation in the 2015 contest was set to be a one-off event, the plan being only to perform again the following year had they won, but it was confirmed in November 2015 by SVT that they would participate in the 2016 contest. Australia is the first country from the Oceania region (and the second country outside Eurasia, after Morocco in 1980) to participate in the contest.\n\nAustralian broadcaster Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) first broadcast the Eurovision Song Contest in 1983 and has continued to do so every year since. The contest has attracted a strong viewing audience in Australia, primarily because a significant proportion of the population have ancestry in Europe (in particular in the United Kingdom). Early broadcasts of the Contest in Australia either featured no commentary or used the 's commentary as transmitted by the BBC. In , actress and comedian Mary Coustas provided commentary for the Contest performing as her comedic character Effie. In and , SBS presenter Des Mangan provided commentary for the Australian audience. From , Julia Zemiro and Sam Pang were assigned as commentators for the competition by SBS. saw SBS replace the commentators with comedian Joel Creasey and TV and radio personality Myf Warhurst. In addition to broadcasting the contest, SBS has also broadcast the and 60th anniversary programmes.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, SBS allowed Australian viewers to participate in their own televote for the Grand Finals. However, these votes were not counted at the actual contest and did not affect the overall result. The SBS commentary team and Australian delegation were awarded a commentary booth of their own at the 2012 contest in Baku. They have been allocated a commentary booth every year since.\n\nIn the event that Australia should win the Eurovision Song Contest, the EBU had confirmed that in accordance with the rules, Australia would not host the event in the southern hemisphere, and instead would co-host the contest in Europe. Further to the EBU's statement it was confirmed that and their broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) would be the first choice, and 's broadcaster British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) being the back-up hosts should Germany decline.\n\nAlthough not actively participating at the Eurovision Song Contest prior to the 2013 semifinal interval presentation, Australia has appeared in the contest incidentally in a number of ways:\n\n\nAustralia's first appearance in the international broadcast of the Eurovision Song Contest occurred on 14 May 2013 during the first semi-final in Malmö, Sweden. A short pre-recorded video titled \"Greetings from Australia\" (also referred to as \"Why Australia Loves Eurovision\"), submitted by SBS and hosted by Julia Zemiro, was broadcast during the interval acts. This presentation marked 30 years of broadcasting the Eurovision Song Contest in Australia, and was preceded the week leading up to the contest by a locally broadcast documentary, also hosted by Zemiro, detailing her love of ABBA, titled \"Road to Eurovision\".\n\nOn 24 March 2014, the Danish broadcaster DR gave permission to SBS to perform as an interval act in the second semi-final of Eurovision Song Contest 2014. One day later, on 25 March, Jessica Mauboy was internally selected to perform. On 8 May 2014, Mauboy sang her song \"Sea of Flags\" in the second semi-final.\n\nSBS made the country's debut at the 2015 Contest with the song \"Tonight Again\" a song written and performed by Guy Sebastian. Although Australia is outside the European Broadcasting Area, the European Broadcasting Union and Austrian host broadcaster ORF decided to permit an Australian entry to commemorate the 60th Contest. The special circumstances surrounding Australia's entry and \"to not reduce the chances\" of the semi-final participants led the organisers to allow Australia to compete directly in the grand final without pre-qualification. The 2015 Australian jury consisted of Amanda Pelman (Chair), Richard Wilkins, Danielle Spencer and Jake Stone.\n\nAlthough Australia's participation in 2015 was announced as a one-off event, it was confirmed on 17 November 2015 that Australia would participate in the 2016 contest. Unlike in 2015, Australia did not receive automatic qualification. On 7 October 2015, it was announced that Australia would make its debut at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2015 after SBS was invited to perform in the contest. The 2016 Australian jury consisted of Monica Trapaga (Chair), Shannon Noll, Myf Warhurst, James Mathison and Craig Porteils.\nThe Australian candidate for the contest was Dami Im.\n\nAustralia continued its participation at the 2017 contest following their success the previous year. On 7 March 2017 at the Paris Cat Jazz Club in the city of Melbourne, Australia, SBS announced former \"X Factor Australia\" winner Isaiah Firebrace as Australia's entry into the 62nd instalment of the contest. With the song \"Don't Come Easy\", Isaiah participated in the first semi-final on 9 May, then the finals on 13 May in which Australia placed 9th. The 2017 Australian jury consisted of Lucy Durack, Natasha Cupitt, Steven Capaldo, Jackie Loeb and Peter Hayward.\n\nAustralia competed in the 2018 contest, selecting Jessica Mauboy as the artist to represent the country. The 2018 Australian jury comprised Richard Wilkins (Chair), Zan Rowe, Jordan Raskopoulos, L-FRESH the Lion and Millie Millgate. Although this continued Australia's track record of perfect attendance in the final (a record it now only shares with Ukraine), it was the first instance of them not finishing in the top ten, ending in twentieth place with 99 points (only nine of which came from the televote, the first time Australia finished last in the televote).\n\nIt was announced that for the first time, 2019 will provide Australians the opportunity to choose their Eurovision representative. The \"Eurovision - Australia Decides\" national final will take place on 9 February 2019, with a 50/50 say between an Australian jury and a televote to determine who will represent Australia at the 2019 contest in Tel Aviv, Israel. \"Eurovision: Australia Decides\" will be hosted in Gold Coast, Queensland by Myf Warhurst and Joel Creasey.\n\n\nAs of , Australia's voting history is as follows.\n\nComposer Award \n\n"}

It was donated to Florida International University Libraries in 2001 by the Cuban discographer and Lawyer Cristobal Diaz Ayala. The archive supports the Florida International University's mission of teaching, research, and service by providing means for the discovery and the pursuit of knowledge. It was started prior to 1960 in Cuba and then restarted in Puerto Rico in 1960. At present the collection comprises approximately 150,000 units.\n\nThis initiative was started prior to 1960 by Mr. Diaz-Ayala. The collection contains more than 150,000 items in total and is currently being expanded. It was recently appraised at over one million of dollars. The materials collected include a variety of formats such as books, LP’s, 78rpm, 45rpm, CDs, photos, videos, cassettes, sheet music, catalogs, RCA Victor cards, and posters, among others. The collection does not only include materials from Latin America musicians but also from artists from all around the world that have a connection to Latin roots.\n\nRare and valuable items recorded during the pre-revolutionary Cuba are part of the DAC. Under this category, it is possible to find cylinders, pianola rolls, 78 rpm, and rare books. Fragile 78 rpm records have been digitized in order to preserve them and keep them available for academic and research purposes. At the moment, it is possible to retrieve information about all the 78 rpm records as well as part of the Cuban and Puerto Rican LPs recordings through the collection metadata available at DAC website.\n\nMore than 350 interviews were incorporated into the DAC collection. Renowned performers, composers, and musicians such as Alfredo \"Chocolate\" Armenteros, Abelardo Barroso, Bola de Nieve, and Isolina Carrillo are part of these conversations. The interviews contain significant and non-published information about how the groups were created, when and by whom, names and history about music companies, artist’s biographical information, and others. It provides researchers with the opportunity to learn more about personal experiences and anecdotes of the artists, groups, entrepreneurs, etc.\n\nThe largest part of the magnetic tape collection corresponds to recordings made from 78’ discs that are not contained in the collection or were never recorded in any other format, not only from Cuban music but also from other Latin American countries. Today, the FIU libraries are trying to fund a project that allows the digitization of magnetic tapes, since most of the tapes have more than 40 years of existence, which places them in a dangerous situation. The risk of demagnetization increases daily, since the estimated tape life expectancy ranges from less than ten years to a couple of decades.\n\nCristobal Diaz Ayala was born on June 20, 1930 in Havana, Cuba. He studied at the University of Havana, where he attended the School of Journalism, obtained a degree in Social Sciences, and graduated from the Faculty of Law.

Intended as a spiritual sequel to Love's \"\", the game was developed over the course of a month and was released as a free download on April 4, 2011. \"Don't take it personally\" is a visual novel, with the majority of the plot taking place outside of the player's control except for key decisions. It follows a new high school literature teacher in 2027 over the course of a semester, with the ability to see private messages between students at any time without their knowledge. It deals with themes of privacy and relationships in the future. The game was received positively, with critics praising the interplay between the metafictional elements of the story and those of the game itself, with special acknowledgment reserved for the writing.\n\n\"Don't take it personally\" is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game where the majority of the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.\n\nIn a departure from most visual novels the player can also see, at any time, the equivalent of texts and Facebook postings between the students on a school social network called AmieConnect (often shortened to \"Amie\"), as well as conversation threads on a 4chan-like imageboard that serve as foreshadowing for future plot points. These extra conversations take place in parallel to in-person conversations between characters, occasionally at the same time; the player is notified anytime a new text message or post is made. A single playthrough of the game takes \"over an hour\".\n\nThe game is set in a private high school in Ontario, in 2027. The player follows a new 11th-grade literature teacher at the school, John Rook, who has recently had his second divorce and is undergoing, in his words, a \"bizarre midlife crisis\" that has led him to quit his career in computers and become a teacher. The students in his class are Arianna Belle-Essai, Kendall Flowers, Taylor Gibson, Charlotte Grewal, Isabella Hart, Nolan Striukas, and Akira Yamazaki. Rook and all of the students have school-issued computers, which the students use to communicate between each other in private and public messages. Rook, and therefore the player, can see all of the messages that the students send, even the private ones; the school administration has told Rook that it is for monitoring online bullying, and that he is not to let anyone know that he can see students' private messages.\n\nSoon after the game opens, the player learns that Kendall and Charlotte have just broken up out of a lesbian relationship, while a few weeks prior Taylor and Nolan had broken up out of a heterosexual relationship. Arianna develops a crush on the teacher, which in the player's first decision point Rook can reciprocate or not. Akira soon comes out as gay, finding to his dismay that everyone else already knew. He then attempts to enter into a relationship with Nolan, who is unsure how to respond; Rook can encourage him to try it out or let him decide on his own, but he enters a relationship with Akira regardless.\n\nThe next day, Isabella misses a meeting she set up with Rook, and does not return to the class. Through Amie texts and wall posts, the other students insinuate that she committed suicide, while the school is unable to provide Rook with any contact information for her. Class continues without her, and a little while later Arianna, if the player rejected her earlier in the game, makes another attempt to have a relationship with Rook. The player may choose to accept or reject her again. Through Amie, Rook learns that both Charlotte and Kendall wish to resume their relationship, and can influence Charlotte to try again or not, which changes whether or not they get back together. Taylor jealously and unsuccessfully tries to drive a wedge between Nolan and Akira.\n\nAs the end of term approaches, Rook begins getting strange emails about Isabella's death, and begins seeing shinigami figures. Upset by these occurrences, when Akira's mother asks to speak to him concerning misuses of Amie, he assumes that she has found out that he is spying on the students' conversations. When he meets her, he finds that Isabella is alive and had simply moved away; the students made it look like she was dead via Amie as a prank that got out of control. Furthermore, they already knew that he could see their messages; Akira's mother explains that the students have no idea of online privacy, having always had technology like Amie, and assumed that anything they put online—even \"private\" messages—might be read by anyone. The game ends with Rook having a casual lunch with the students, a date with Arianna, or neither, depending on the choices made during the game by the player.\n\n\"Don't take it personally\" was developed over the course of a month, and was released as a free download on April 4, 2011. It was written and developed by Christine Love, with artwork made for the game by Auro-Cyanide, artwork licensed from Tokudaya and Kimagure After, and with music licensed from Rengoku Teien and propanmode. It was created using the Ren'Py engine. It was Love's longest game to date, and her first attempt at a game with a branching storyline. It was intended as \"a spiritual sequel of sorts\" to \"\", a 2010 game by Love. The game was made for NaNoRenO (National Ren'ai Game Writing Month), a month-long contest in the vein of National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) where developers attempt to create a visual novel in one month. Love's favorite character to write was Kendall.\n\n\"Don't take it personally\" was chosen as a \"freeware game pick\" by IndieGames's Michael Rose, who said that it was worth playing through multiple times in order to see the different paths the story takes depending on the player's choices. \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the visual novel the award for \"Best Script\" in its video game awards of 2011, stating that \"Love's layered narrative of a high school teacher embroiled in his student's worries goes places most mainstream video games wouldn't dare.\" Pete Davidson of \"GamePro\" noted the game as an example of the \"creativity\" missing in many large-budget titles, and praised the story, calling Love \"a writer first and a game developer second.\" Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the game as \"a game about love, sex and the internet\" that was \"capable of being profoundly moving\" and was about \"what it is to feel like someone's kicked me straight in the heart\". He praised Love's ability to use dialogue to effect an emotional response, though he noted that the game seemed to lose some of its impact in the final chapters and felt that the use of the \"12chan\" threads as a Greek chorus was \"perhaps a meta-layer too far\".\n\nAaron Poppleton of PopMatters called the game \"a meditation on privacy in the modern age\" and \"one of the more thoughtful games to come out in a long time.\" He criticized the art direction of the game, saying that the limitation of creating the game in a month led to poor artwork and an unpolished presentation that let down the possibilities of the story. He did note that the story and writing of the game made the downsides of the game \"almost entirely a moot point\", and that it is a very strong game. Pete Davidson of \"PC World\", in an article about the treatment of sexuality in video games, called out the game as an example of a game that used sexual themes maturely to explore love and relationships. Emily Short of Gamasutra, in a discussion about the game, said that it was definitely worth playing and full of \"charming characters, colorful dialogue, and important questions\", but criticized the uneven exploration of issues regarding privacy versus personal boundaries. She said that the game's lack of focus on Rook's issues with personal and professional boundaries was a weakness in the story, given that the distinction between boundaries and privacy was crucial to the plot. Love collated common criticisms and reviews of the game on her blog, summarizing that while it was less praised than \"Digital: A Love Story\", most players seemed to like the way she wrote the relationships and overall story. There was a consensus, however, that her portrayal of Rook was weak and that many players seemed to miss both that he was intended to be \"an absolutely awful teacher\" and that the potential relationship with Arianna was intended to be creepy and make the player feel bad. She also noted that her use of licensed artwork detracted from the game's potential in comparison to the reaction to the custom works.\n\n"}

The game was released on October 16, 2012. \"Harvey's New Eyes\" is a sequel to \"\".\n\nThe game is set in a 2D cartoon world. The player controls Lilli. Unlike most other adventure games, there are no clickable dialogues. After the player clicks on a character, a bar appears with some symbols indicating a subject. The game neither has a list with actions such as Walk, Look, Talk, Pick up, Use. If applicable, items are automatically added to the inventory when the user clicks on them. Furthermore, the user must combine objects in his inventory in order to create new ones (or to modify existing items). Objects in the inventory can be given to other characters or can be combined with items not in the inventory.\n\nThe game starts in a strict boarding school led by a female convent order. The head of the convent order is abbess Ignatz. One of the pupils is Lilli, the main character. She is a shy, insecure little girl not daring to speak in public. She does not have her own opinions (or is afraid to tell them) and she executes all charged tasks. Another pupil is Edna and it is obvious she is not as crazy as in .\n\nThe abbess can't stand the youthful behavior anymore. That's why she wants to bring in doctor Marcel. He must brainwash the children so they will be all good and modest. When Edna hears this news she wants to escape: she pushed doctor Marcel from the stairs at the end of The Breakout and let him behind for being dead although she can't remember the reason. She is now afraid doctor Marcel wants revenge if he finds her. That's why Edna gives Lilli the task to remove all evidence of Edna's presence.\n\nLilli discovers that Gerret, one of the elder students, is an undercover agent. He wants to expose the malpractice of Ignatz. He also warns Lilli she might get caught by Marcel, which eventually happens. Marcel uses the ragdoll Harvey to hypnotize Lilli. The hypnosis prevents Lilli taking the following actions: playing with fire, to disobey adults, to lie, to drink alcohol, to use sharp objects, to enter dangerous places and to get angry. Each time Lilli makes a violation, the hypnosis gives her an electric shock. At such time, a demon-version of Harvey turns up and tells Lilli what she has done wrong.\n\nGerret gives Lilli a truth serum, which has to be drunk by Ignatz. By doing this, Gerret discovers that the misbehavior is caused by a child-hood trauma. Gerret also tells Lilli she can beat the hypnosis by fighting the prohibition-demons. This action causes her to go into trance. In these trance-worlds she is able to find solutions to get rid of the prohibitions one by one.\n\nIn meantime, Edna escaped the boarding school and Lilli and Gerret try to find her. Edna gets kidnapped by some men who work for Marcel. They take her to the asylum. Gerret seeks for help while Lilli penetrates into the asylum. Lilli eventually finds Edna in her former cell, where both Gerret and the brainwashed Ignatz are also held captive. Lilli is able to get Ignatz out of her trance. Ignatz regrets her actions and gives Lilli a knife to rescue Edna and Gerret. Marcel tries to convince Lilli she is very ill and needs therapy. Edna remembers what happened in The Breakout. As Lilli has overcome all her restrictions, she can do whatever she wants. This causes the game to have three different endings: she stabs Marcel, she confirms she is ill and goes into therapy, or she objects and leaves.\n\nAccording to Carsten Fichtelmann of Daedalic Entertainment, \"Edna & Harvey\" achieved physical sales of 80,000 copies at German retailers.\n\nThe game was awarded a score of 75/100 on Metacritic, which is better than its , which only received 57/100. On AdventureGamers.com the game got a 3.5 out of 5 with the remark it is a good game with an easy interface, although not as fun as The Breakout. IGN gave the game a rating of 6/10 asserting that most of the characters are underdeveloped and that the environments are banal and uninteresting.\n"}

It was written by Carlos Trillo, and drawn by Ernesto García Seijas. The words \"Negro\" and \"Blanco\" mean black and white in Spanish, but Blanco is simply the family name of the main character and \"Negro\" is a common Argentinian nickname.\n\nSame as with the former comic strip El Loco Chávez that this one replaced, the main character is a fictional journalist, who works in a fictional depiction of the Clarín newspaper that published it. Most story arcs were about both some weird news report assigned to him, or trivial ones that develop an unexpected twist, and a romantic affair. The Negro Blanco develops relations with many different women, but Chispa Valdéz and Flopi Bach are recurring ones.\n\n\"El Negro Blanco\" was published by the \"Clarín newspaper\" from 1987 to 1994. It replaced \"El Loco Chávez\" at the page devoted to comic strips, being replaced at its end by El Nene Montanaro. The newspaper added extra stories at the Sunday magazine on some occasions. Ivrea republished the whole run of the comic strip in 10 comic books in prestige format in 2006, and El Globo Editor published a specific story arc in 1993.\n\nThe character Carlos Marcucci is freely based on a real man with that name, friend of the writer Carlos Trillo. According to Marcucci, Ernesto García Seijas accurately portrayed him as an ugly man, who is nevertheless successful with women (however, the comic strip took that to parodic levels).\n\nTo design the character of Flopi Bach, Seijas modeled her after Araceli González, then an unknown model hired for that work. The character was very successful, and both González and the character appeared at a 1991 issue of the Argentine edition of the\" Playboy \"magazine. It was the first time that \"Playboy \"published erotic images of a fictional character instead of photos of real people. Seijas took the character for spin-off series, after the end of the comic strip.\n\nTrillo and Seijas worked as well in the \"Sangre de brujas\" () comic book, another spin-off with the character Agatha.\n"}

Hustler Magazine Centerfold Model and 'scream queen' actress Gail Harris made appearances in many episodes. This grouping of soft core porn first started in London under the direction of Paul Raymond, famous for his 'top shelf' men's magazines including \"Men Only\" and \"Club International\". Paul Raymond also owned the Raymond Revuebar, a striptease club in Soho London. The UK saw these shows on video tape, prior to them being picked by Playboy. A film tie-in, titled Electric Blue - The Movie, was released theatrically in the UK in 1982 and on VHS in 1983, and featured Marilyn Chambers presenting archive nude footage of celebrities including Marilyn Monroe, Joanna Lumley, Jayne Mansfield and Jacqueline Bisset.\n\nIt appeared on home video releases in North America, Australia, New Zealand in the early to mid-1980s.\n\n\"Electric Blue\" was derived from the UK and were a subsidiary of the Video Classics group of labels in Australia.

{"id": "28098592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28098592", "title": "Firing of Shirley Sherrod", "text": "Firing of Shirley Sherrod\n\nOn July 19, 2010, Shirley Sherrod was fired from her appointed position as Georgia State Director of Rural Development for the United States Department of Agriculture. Her firing was an administration reaction to media reports on video excerpts from her address to an event of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in March 2010 and commentary posted by conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart on his website. Based on these excerpts, the NAACP condemned Sherrod's remarks as racist and US government officials called on the official to resign. However, review of her full speech showed that the excerpts had been selectively edited, and that her remarks – understood in context – were about the importance of overcoming personal prejudices. The NAACP and White House officials then apologized for their earlier criticisms, and United States Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack apologized for the firing and offered Sherrod a new position.\n\nExtensive media coverage of the excerpted videos, various parties' comments, and later corrections after the full story was discovered, exacerbated the affair. The event brought to the forefront current debates regarding racism in the United States, cable news reporting, ideological websites on the internet, and decisions made by President Barack Obama's administration.\n\nThe Obama administration apologized to Sherrod, and offered her a full-time, high-level internal advocacy position with the USDA, which she ultimately declined. In 2011, Sherrod filed suit against Breitbart and co-defendant Larry O'Connor for defamation. In 2015, following lengthy pretrial proceedings, and efforts by Breitbart to have the suit dismissed which were rejected, the parties settled the suit on undisclosed terms.\n\nWhen Shirley Sherrod addressed the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund on August 21, 2010, she claimed to have been aware of the videos on July 14, 2010; five days before they were posted on Andrew Breitbart's BigGovernment.com website. Sherrod says that she immediately notified the USDA about the videos, saying that they did not convey the entire or accurate story. She heard nothing from the USDA until Monday, July 19, 2010, when she was put on administrative leave and then asked to resign. Released White House emails show the Obama administration was aware of the situation, but there was no evidence that the dismissal of Sherrod was under orders of the White House.\n\nOn July 19, 2010, two different video clips were posted by the conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart to his BigGovernment.com website, along with a nearly 1,000-word blog post in which he accused the mainstream media and the NAACP of falsely labeling the Tea Party as racist. He states in the blog post, \"eventually, her basic humanity informs that this white man is poor and needs help\", and that the main point of the blog post and video release was that \"Sherrod's racist tale is received by the NAACP audience with nodding approval and murmurs of recognition and agreement. Hardly the behavior of the group now holding itself up as the supreme judge of another group's racial tolerance.\"\n\nThe first video showed Sherrod describing an experience of working with a white man seeking help to save his farm. She struggled with helping him at a time when many black people were losing their land. In the excerpt, she says \"So, I didn't give him the full force of what I could do.\" She claims to have taken him to a white lawyer, telling the audience that —\"his own kind would take care of him.\" She said she realized it was about the poor versus \"those who have\".\n\nSubsequent events showed that the posted video was an excerpt of broader comments that conveyed a very different meaning, in which Sherrod learned from her experience. The excerpts posted by Breitbart ran for 2 minutes, 38 seconds in total, while the full video was 43 minutes 15 seconds long. Breitbart said he did not edit the video excerpt which he released and did not have a copy of the entire speech. The full video was produced by a Douglas, Georgia, company that filmed the banquet for the local Georgia chapter of the NAACP. The owner of the video company, Johnny Wilkerson, said on July 20 that he was sending the full video to the national NAACP and would post it in full once he got permission to do so. Breitbart's source for the excerpt remained confidential .\n\nMuch of the controversy related to the incident involved which parties took which actions and when. Media Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog organization, compiled an extensive timeline of the affair. Greg Pollowitz of \"National Review Online\", a conservative publication, said that the Media Matters timeline was \"as good as any I’ve seen.\"\n\nThe first news outlet to report on the Breitbart video was FoxNews.com, which posted an article about the story on its website. The New York City affiliate for CBS posted a report on its website later that afternoon. The \"Atlanta Journal Constitution\" website soon picked up the story. In addition, the story was picked up and reported widely in the blogosphere.\n\nSherrod later said that on the afternoon of July 19, she received numerous demands from government officials to submit her resignation, demands which she characterized as harassment. In response to a call from USDA deputy undersecretary Cheryl Cook, Sherrod submitted her resignation via email that same day. Sherrod claims that Cook told her White House officials wanted her to quit immediately because the controversy was \"going to be on Glenn Beck tonight\", a claim disputed by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs.\n\nThat same evening, the President of the NAACP, Benjamin Jealous, posted a tweet saying that his organization was \"appalled\" by Sherrod's comments. The following day, the USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack released a statement explaining his agency's actions and suggested that Sherrod's statements as shown damaged her effectiveness at a time when USDA was working to improve its previous civil rights abuses.\n\nThe Breitbart video was first broadcast that evening on \"The O'Reilly Factor\", a talk show on the Fox News Channel; host Bill O'Reilly said Sherrod should resign. At the time of the taping of the show, news of Sherrod's resignation had not yet been reported, nor had the NAACP yet released the full video. But, the program was not broadcast until after Sherrod resigned and O'Reilly's staff had confirmed that fact with the USDA.\n\nDana Loesch, an organizer for the Tea Party in Saint Louis, Missouri, mentioned the video in an appearance on \"Larry King Live\"; it was also shown on \"Anderson Cooper 360\" (both on CNN). It was discussed on \"Hannity\" and \"On The Record with Greta Van Susteren\" (both on Fox) as well, but notably not on \"Glenn Beck\".\n\nIn the full video, Sherrod related her experience in 1986 with the first white farmer to come to her for help. (On July 20 CNN received a telephone call from the farmer's wife and learned his name was Roger Spooner.) Sherrod said that his land was being sold, and \"had in fact already been rented out from under him.\" At first, she felt that he had a superior attitude toward her, causing her to recall harsh aspects of her life in the South, including the murder of her father; Sherrod went on to say that she had not let that get in the way and did not discriminate against him. They became very good friends as a result of her help. She admitted thinking at the time that white people had \"all the advantages\" but learned that poverty affected both races.\n\nAccording to Sherrod, she did her job correctly by taking the farmer to a white lawyer who she thought could help him, and she looked for another lawyer when needed. Sherrod rejected claims that she was racist and said she \"went all out\" to help the man keep his farm. She said that the incident helped her learn to move beyond race, and she told the story to audiences to make that point.\n\nRoger Spooner, the farmer, said on CNN that Sherrod is not a racist, that she did everything she could for his family; more than 20 years later, he and Sherrod remain friends. The Spooners credit Sherrod with helping them save their farm: \"If it hadn't been for her, we would've never known who to see or what to do\", Roger Spooner said. \"She led us right to our success.\" His wife, Eloise Spooner, said that \"after things kind of settled down, she brought Sherrod some tomatoes out of her garden, and they had a good visit.\" Eloise Spooner recalled Sherrod as \"nice-mannered, thoughtful, friendly; a good person.\" The couple were surprised by the controversy. \"I don't know what brought up the racist mess\", Roger Spooner said. \"They just want to stir up some trouble, it sounds to me in my opinion.\" Eloise Spooner said that on seeing the story of Sherrod's resignation, \"I said, 'That ain't right. They have not treated her right.'\"\n\nThe extended unedited video of her speech released by the NAACP showed that in her full speech, Sherrod emphasized what was only touched on in the excerpt: she said that she learned from the incident that poverty, not race, was the key factor in rural development. She said she ultimately worked hard to save the farmer's land.\n\nOther references to race in Sherrod's speech related to a story of her more recent help of a black family to prevent forced sale of their farmland. It was a case in which distant cousins, among numerous heirs, were forcing a sale of land that the family had owned since the grandfather bought it. She noted finding some honest lawyer who happened to be white, and also that the cousins in the North had lined up a white buyer.\n\nWithin hours of the excerpted video's being shown, Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP, condemned Sherrod for having abused her power and criticized the apparent audience reaction as well.\n\nAfter the NAACP released the entire videotape, its officials retracted their previous statement and said:\n\nDuring the uproar over Sherrod's resignation, Vilsack released a statement on July 20 saying that the USDA would \"conduct a thorough review and consider additional facts\". Sherrod said that she might not want the job any more.\n\nOn July 21, 2010, Fox News rejected claims that it inflamed the situation. While the story was not mentioned on the Fox News Channel until after Sherrod's resignation, the edited video and an accompanying article had been published on the Fox News website, as well as those of several other news organizations, prior to her resignation.\n\nLater, the White House sought official review of the case. Sherrod watched live at the CNN Center when Robert Gibbs, White House press spokesman, extended her an apology. She said she welcomed the review and accepted the apology.\n\nOn July 21, Vilsack of USDA apologized personally and publicly to Sherrod for forcing her resignation based on an \"out-of-context video\". He said that he had offered Sherrod a new position in the department, and that she was taking time to consider it. That night, Bill O'Reilly apologized to Sherrod for his remarks calling for her removal from office. He had been the first on cable television to air the video excerpt posted by Breitbart.\n\nInitially, Breitbart claimed Sherrod harbored racist sentiments. On July 20, 2010, in an interview with CNN's John King, Breitbart said that releasing the video was \"...not about Shirley Sherrod. It's about the NAACP. This was about the NAACP attacking the Tea Party and this [the video of Ms. Sherrod] is showing racism at an NAACP event. I did not ask for Shirley Sherrod to be fired. I did not ask for any repercussions for Shirley Sherrod. They were the ones that took the initiative to get rid of her.\" Breitbart questioned CNN's acceptance of Eloise Spooner's self-reported identity in a phone interview. In a July 30 interview with \"Newsweek\", Breitbart said he would be glad to meet with Sherrod privately. He agreed that the excerpted video took her statements out of context and said that if he could do things all over again, he would not have posted the excerpted video, but he did not apologize to Sherrod.\n\nPresident Barack Obama spoke to Sherrod personally in a phone call that lasted for seven minutes. Although he did not apologize personally to her, Sherrod said she was \"very, very pleased with the conversation.\" On July 22, Sherrod said she planned to sue Breitbart, who published the excerpted video that led to her resignation. She also said that she would like to see Breitbart's BigGovernment.com website \"shut down\".\n\nIn an interview with the CNN reporter Anderson Cooper, Sherrod referred to Breitbart as \"vicious\" and a \"racist\", and said that he would \"like to get us stuck back in the times of slavery\". \"National Review\" commentators suggested she owed Breitbart an apology, and \"Salon's\" Joan Walsh said Sherrod's assertion came from her own viewpoint.\n\nAfter learning of Breitbart's death on March 1, 2012, Sherrod released the following statement: \"The news of Mr. Breitbart's death came as a surprise to me when I was informed of it this morning. My prayers go out to Mr. Breitbart's family as they cope during this very difficult time.\" Andrew Breitbart's widow has taken his place as defendant in the ongoing lawsuit.\n\nCommentators attributed the rivalry between the left and the right as an important factor in the controversy. The NAACP had passed a resolution asking the Tea Party to repudiate racist language among its members. Breitbart said he posted the videos in response. Commentators from each side noted that racial issues were being manipulated for political gain. Imani Perry, a professor at Princeton's Center for African American Studies, said some conservatives manipulated white fears for political advantage:I think many white Americans are fearful that with Obama in the White House, and the diversity in his appointments, that the racial balance of power is shifting. And that's frightening both because people always are afraid to give up privilege, and because of the prospect of a black-and-brown backlash against a very ugly history. Some liberals have long maintained that racism requires power, and so black people can't be racist. Obama's election undercut the first argument and made the specter of black racism appear more threatening.\n\nAfter the release of the full video, media outlets across the political spectrum criticized the decision to force Sherrod to resign.\n\nJeff Greenfield of CBS News criticized the role of the 24-hour news, saying, \nThe old United Press International wire service had a slogan: 'Get it first, but first get it right'. In the wake of the Shirley Sherrod story, it's worth asking whether more and more the second half of that slogan has been dumped into the trash bin. \nThe BBC commented about \"the absurdity of the spin-cycle in which American journalists and politicians are intertwined and about the febrile atmosphere that surrounds any story about race.\" \"The New York Times\" noted that, \"Politically charged stories often take root online before being shared with a much wider audience on Fox. The television coverage, in turn, puts pressure on other news media outlets to follow up\".\n\nMediaite's Steve Krakauer reported that although FoxNews.com broke the story, it was later reported by other online sites such as the \"Atlanta Journal Constitution's,\" and that it was repeated by a number of people on various shows and networks. He noted full coverage by other networks and channels, so Sherrod's resignation was not simply because of the Fox News coverage. Howard Kurtz said in \"The Washington Post\" that the Fox News network, with the exception of brief comments by O'Reilly, did not discuss the story until after Sherrod's resignation was widely reported. Clemente of Fox News said that it was a mistake to have put the story on their website before Sherrod's resignation was announced.\n\nIn an interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News, the civil rights activist the Reverend Jesse Jackson said that he regretted that coverage given to the Sherrod incident had overshadowed more important federal actions that month. The government had settled longstanding claims of racial discrimination in programs of USDA and the Department of Interior. Jackson noted the landmark nature of the national settlements of these cases and that tens of thousands of people benefited from the compensation for previous injustices. He said:\nAppearing on ABC's \"The View\" on July 29, President Obama characterized the controversy over Sherrod's firing as a \"bogus\" one generated by the media; he said his administration overreacted in forcing her out.\n\nIn February 2011, Sherrod filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia against Andrew Breitbart, Breitbart News' Larry O'Connor, and a \"John Doe,\" who, according to the complaint, is \"an individual whose identity has been concealed by the other defendants and who, according to defendant Breitbart, was involved in the deceptive editing of the video clip and encouraged its publication with the intent to defame Mrs. Sherrod.\" In her complaint, Sherrod accused Breitbart of defamation, false light and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Following Breitbart's death in 2012, Breitbart's estate was substituted as a defendant.\n\nThe defendants removed the case to federal court. Breitbart and O'Connor filed joint motions for dismissal on First Amendment grounds, claiming that the suit was barred by an anti-SLAPP law. The motion was denied, and in February 2012, the U.S. District Court issued a six-page \"statement of reasons\" which accused Breitbart and O'Connor of wasting \"a considerable amount of judicial and litigant resources\" on their \"'novel' if not overreaching motion.\" This ruling was affirmed by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in June 2013.\n\nThe case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon, who repeatedly expresses frustration with the U.S. government's delays in providing discovery. In July 2014, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned Judge Leon's order directing Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack to give a deposition as part of pretrial discovery. Sherrod was represented by the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis.\n\nIn October 2015, the parties settled the case on undisclosed terms, issuing a joint statement saying: \"The parties regret the harm that Mrs. Sherrod suffered as a result of these events. In a gesture they hope will inspire others to engage in the difficult but critically important process of bridging racial divides, the parties have agreed to resolve this lawsuit on confidential terms.\"\n\nPrimary documentation\n\nCommentary by principals\n\nBiographies\n\nWorks\n"}
{"id": "44488908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44488908", "title": "French playing cards", "text": "French playing cards\n\nFrench playing cards (\"jeu de cartes\") are cards that use the French suits of (clovers or clubs ), (tiles or diamonds ), (hearts ), and (pikes or spades ). Each suit contains three face cards; the (knave or jack), the (lady or queen), and the (king). Aside from these aspects, decks can include a wide variety of regional and national patterns which often have different deck sizes. In comparison to Spanish, Italian, German, and Swiss playing cards, French cards are the most widespread due to the geopolitical, commercial, and cultural influence of France and the United Kingdom in the past two centuries. Other reasons for their popularity were the simplicity of the suit insignia, which simplifies mass production, and the popularity of whist and contract bridge.\n\nPlaying cards arrived in Europe from Mamluk Egypt around 1370 and were already reported in France in 1377. The French suit insignia was derived from German suits around 1480. Between the transition from the suit of bells to tiles there was a suit of crescents.\n\nOne of the most distinguishing features of the French cards is the queen. Mamluk cards and their derivatives, the Latin suited and German suited cards, all have three male face cards. Queens began appearing in Italian tarot decks in the mid-15th century and some German decks replaced two kings with queens. While other decks abandoned the queen in non-tarot decks, the French kept them and dropped the knight as the middle face card. Face card design was heavily influenced by Spanish cards that used to circulate in France. One of the most obvious traits inherited from Spain are the standing kings; kings from Italian, Portuguese, or Germanic cards are seated. Spanish-suited cards are still used in France, mostly in Northern Catalonia, and Brittany and the Vendée with the latter two using the archaic Aluette cards.\n\nIn the 19th century, corner indices and rounded corners were added and cards became reversible, relieving players from having to flip face cards right side up. The index for aces and face cards usually follow the local language but many decks of the Paris pattern use the numeral \"1\" for aces.\n\nThe French suited deck has spawned many regional variations known as standard patterns based on their artwork and deck size. The Paris pattern was heavily exported throughout continental Europe which is why most French-suited patterns share a similar appearance. The English pattern, based on the extinct Rouennais pattern, is the most well known pattern in the world.\n\nNote that patterns do not factor in Jokers as they are a very recent addition which leads to every manufacturer making their own trademarked depiction of this card. Almost all 52-card packs produced in the present will contain at least two jokers unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe Paris pattern came to dominate in France around 1780 and became known as the . From the 19th century to 1945, the appearance of the cards used for domestic consumption was regulated by the French government. All cards were produced on watermarked paper made by the state to show payment of the stamp tax. The most common deck sold in France is the 32-card deck with the 2 to 6 removed and 1s as the index for aces. 52-card decks are also popular. The French have a unique habit of associating their face cards with historic or mythical personages which survives only in the \"portrait officiel\".\n\nThe Belgian-Genoese pattern is very similar to its Parisian parent and is basically an export version not subject to France's domestic stamp tax. The jack of clubs has a triangular shield bearing the coat of arms of the former Spanish Netherlands, face cards are unnamed, and blue is usually replaced with green in the portraits. The diagonal dividing line also lacks the beads. When the Ottoman Empire relaxed the ban against playing cards, Belgian type cards flooded their territory and is now found throughout the Balkans, North Africa, and the Middle East. They are also commonly found in France's former colonies. Within Belgium, the Francophone Walloons are the primary users of this pattern, the Flemish prefer the Dutch pattern. This is the second most common pattern in the world after the English pattern. Belgian decks come in either 32 or 52 cards like in France. \n\nGenoese type cards are identical to Belgian ones but lack corner indices. They come in 36 (no 2s to 5s), 40 (no 8s to 10s), or 52 card decks. \n\nThe Piedmontese pattern is similar to the Genoese packs but its face cards have a horizontal instead of diagonal dividing line and the aces are found in a decorative garland. They also come in the same number of cards as Genoese ones. The Piedmontese pattern was once used in neighboring Savoy as both were previously united until France annexed the latter in 1860. A 78 card tarot version of the Piedmontese pattern, complete with knights, the fool, a suit of trumps depicting flowers, and corner indices, was printed in 1902 for Savoyard players. It was discontinued some time after 1910 but reproductions have been in print since 1984. The Chambéry rules that come with the deck are similar to Piedmontese tarot games but the ace ranked between the jack and the 10 like in Triomphe. It should not be confused with the Italian-suited Piedmontese tarot.\n\nA Parisian variant appeared in Bavaria in the mid-18th century where the king of diamonds wore a turban. This originates from the German-suited Old Bavarian pattern. The king of spades, who used to represent David, no longer holds a harp. This group is closely associated with animal tarots.\nThe Russian pattern created during the early 19th-century is based on a Baltic version of a Bavarian derivative. The current appearance was finalized by Adolf Charlemagne. It usually contains 52 or 36 cards, the latter lacking ranks 2 to 5. The stripped deck is used to play Durak. They can be found in many countries that were once part of the Russian Empire or Soviet Union.\n\nAdler-Cego is the last remaining animal tarot and is used in Germany's Black Forest to play Cego. The courts are based off a Frankfurt version of a Bavarian derivative. It is sold with 54 cards; the 5 to 10 of the red suits and the 1 to 6 of the black suits are removed. Real and fictional animals are displayed on the trump suit but despite its name, eagles do not appear. Trumps have a pink panel in each end with an Arabic numeral to show its rank.\n\nThe Industrie und Glück (Industry and Luck) tarock deck of Central Europe uses Roman numerals for the trumps. It is organized in the same manner as the Adler-Cego decks. Its trumps abandoned the traditional allegorical motifs found in Italian tarocchi decks in favor of new, more whimsical scenes like depictions of rural life. The turban wearing king is now in the suit of spades.\n\nFrench-suited cards are popular in Central Europe and compete very well against local German playing cards. Hamburg was once a major card-producing hub where makers began revising the Paris pattern. The patterns in this family have the king of spades keeping David's harp.\nThe North-German pattern was created in Stralsund from a Hamburg derivative. It is often erroneously called the Berlin pattern. The crownless queens' hairstyles reflect the Biedermeier fashions of the day. They are usually in decks of 32 cards with the twos to sixes missing since skat, Germany's most popular card game, does not require a full deck. Decks of 36 cards (with the sixes) are for jass and tapp, a game played in Baden-Württemberg. Decks of 52 cards usually include three jokers but Zwickern decks have six jokers. \n\nThe French-Swiss pattern shares the same descent from the North-German pattern's Hamburg parent but their most distinguishing characteristic is that instead of having corner indices, white Arabic numerals are found within the pips closest to the corner. French-Swiss cards comes only in decks of 36 with no ranks from two to five.\n\nThe Modern Portuguese pattern is a Parisian derivative from Germany. When it arrived in Portugal, the kings and jacks in hearts and diamonds swapped suits. The composition consists of 52 cards or until recently 40 cards. The latter had an unusual ranking (ace, king, jack, queen, eight, six–two). The jack ranking higher than the queen comes from the older Portuguese games where a female knave was outranked by the knight. They also use French-language indices.\n\nThe Dutch pattern originates from Germany and shares the same parent as the Modern Portuguese pattern but with different queens. It was not produced in the Netherlands until the 1970s. Their most distinguishing feature are scenic aces. Also found in Flanders, they come in decks of 32 (no twos to sixes) or 52 cards.\n\nThe Trente et Quarante pattern is named after the game it is associated with. Unlike other patterns, it is usually found only in casinos. Although of German origin, this pattern is now produced only in Italy. They consist of 52 cards and no indices.\n\nAround 1870, Dondorf of Frankfurt produced the Rhineland pattern. The kings have very thick beards. They have fallen out of popularity in Germany but are very common in Poland, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, and the Baltic states. They come in decks of 24 (no 2s to 8s), 32 (no 2s to 6s), or 52 cards, the latter of which may have up to three jokers in some countries.\n\nThe Tarot Nouveau was designed by C.L. Wüst of Frankfurt in the mid-19th century. It is popular in Francophone Europe and Quebec and is also used in Denmark to play tarot games that require the full 78-card deck. Like the Industrie und Glück, the trumps depict genre scenes but modern editions use Arabic numerals instead of Roman ones.\n\nSwedes used to use Bavarian derived patterns. In the early 20th-century, the firm Öberg & Son invented a new pattern unrelated to the old ones. This pattern has spread to neighboring Finland. The clothing for the figures in the court cards are color coordinated; green for spades, red for hearts, purple for clubs, and blue for diamonds. They are in the standard 52-card format.\n\nCard makers from Rouen began exporting to England around 1480. Since Latin-suited cards were already circulating in England, the English renamed French suits to the Latin ones with which they were familiar. Hence the clovers were called clubs and pikes were named after the swords (\"spade\"). The English did not start producing their own cards until a century later. In 1628, the importation of foreign playing cards was banned to protect local manufacturers. English cardmakers produced lower quality cards than their continental counterparts leading to the loss of detail from the Rouennais pattern. Today's pattern is the result of Charles Goodall and Son's reworking of the old Rouen pattern during the 19th century. The majority of decks sold in this pattern is the 52 card deck. One deck invented in the United States but more commonly found in Australia and New Zealand contains 11s, 12s, and red 13s to play the six-handed version of the Euchre variant 500. In the late nineteenth century, they were also used for variants of draw poker and royal cassino. Decks marketed for Canasta often have card point values printed on the cards.\n\nLyon was a major card exporter to German speaking countries from the late 16th through the 18th centuries. While the Lyonnais pattern died out in most places, it survived in Austria and the Czech Republic and its modern incarnations is the Vienna pattern. They come in decks of 24 (no 2s to 8s), 32 (no 2s to 6s), or 52 cards, the latter with corner indices and three jokers.\n\nThe Lombard or Milanese pattern come in 40 card decks that is missing the 8s, 9s, and 10s and lack corner indices. The Lombard decks exported to Swiss Italian regions contain corner indices and also labels the ranks of the face cards. It is probably derived from the Lyonnais pattern and its offshoot, the extinct Provence pattern.\n\nThe Tuscan or Florentine pattern, dating from the mid-19th century, is the only French suited deck that is not reversible in the present. Cards measure 58 × 88 mm but the \"Toscane Grandi\" by Modiano are 67 × 101 mm large. It has the same composition of cards as the Lombard pattern. There was another pattern called \"Tuscan\" but it has ceased printing since the 1980s.\n\nDondorf of Frankfurt produced this pattern around 1900 and now it is used in Patience decks by many companies worldwide. The court cards are dressed in rococo period costumes.\n"}

{"id": "27160419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27160419", "title": "Music and political warfare", "text": "Music and political warfare\n\nMusic and political warfare have been used together in many different political contexts and cultures as a way to reach a targeted audience in order to deliver a specific political message. Political warfare as defined by Paul A. Smith is the \"use of political means to compel an opponent to do one's will... commonly through the use of words, images and ideas.\" Music is useful because it creates an easily recognizable and memorable method of delivery for the desired message. Music is particularly useful medium for the delivery of propaganda. Jacques Ellul stated that for propaganda to be effective it must \"fill the citizen's whole day and every day\". Since music is often viewed to be a leisure activity, it is often not considered to be as threatening as other propaganda techniques, and as a result messages can often be surreptitiously communicated without being conspicuously noticed.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, songs and poems were a very popular form of satire and also served as a medium for sharing the news and gossip of the day. As a result, many of the battles and skirmishes between the Americans and the British were retold and celebrated in the form of songs. Samuel Adams utilized music and protest songs in the mass public demonstrations he organized to protest British practices towards the American colonists\n\nAfter a humiliating retreat for the British-during which time the Americans engaged in the \"ungentlemanly\" act of firing at the backs of their retreating enemy -the British were immortalized in song:\nHow brave you went out with muskets all bright, \nAnd thought to befrighten the folks with the sight;\nBut when you got there how they powder’d your pums, \nAnd all the way home how they pepper’d your bums, \nAnd is it not, honies, a comical farce,\nTo be proud in the face, and be shot in the arse.\nPerhaps the most well known song to emerge during this time was Yankee Doodle. Originally conceived by the British in an attempt to mock and demoralize the ragged American troops, it was instead adopted by the Americans as a rallying anthem. In the language of the day, \"doodle\" referred to a fool or simpleton while \"dandy\" meant a gentleman of highly exaggerated dress and manners. Finally the term \"macaroni\" was a type of dress popular in Italy and widely imitated in England at the time. The song mocked the American's ragged and rough style of dress in comparison to the British armies distinct formal \"red coat\" uniform and portrayed the Americans as backwards and ignorant, a portrayal the Americans openly accepted. Thus instead of demoralizing the Americans, Yankee Doodle instead had the opposite effect of demoralizing the British who were later defeated by this army of \"backwards and ignorant\" individuals.\n\nOne group who understood the role that music played in spreading their political message was the Nazis in Hitler's Germany. Clearly understanding the link between music and political warfare, propaganda minister Josef Goebbels once stated:\n\"Music affects the heart and emotions more than the intellect. Where then could the heart of a nation beat stronger than in the huge masses, in which the heart of a nation has found its true home?\"\n\nHitler made use of music glorifying Germanic legends, such as the works of Richard Wagner. Wagner's operas employed imagery of knights which Hitler then co-opted for images of himself \n\nMusic was used within the Hitler Youth organization as a way to indoctrinate the youth of Germany into the Nazi's ideology. As part of their activities, group singing was a way to educate the young members of the group. According to an internal memo, songs were seen as \"possess[ing] the strongest community building power\".\n\nCommunist states such as the USSR and China have also utilized music as a way to spread their message of global communism. The Soviet Union sought to control the negative influences of music on the people and attempted to shape the messages being used in music to glorify the Soviet regime. Throughout Communist rule, the state sought to create legislation that in effect controlled the creative output of musicians and composers by limiting musical education, controlling which musicians could be employed and by only allowing \"approved\" musical performances-in short ensuring that all music was within keeping with Communist principles and ideology. Songs were often used in the revolutionary period because they could be easily shaped to have explicit and revolutionary messages set to a simple melody.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong believed that it was essential to employ national music in order to \"reeducate\" the Chinese people and make them accept Communist reforms. Mao stated that \n\"in music you may apply appropriate foreign principles and use foreign musical instruments. But still there must be national characteristics...The arts are inseparable from the customs, feelings and even the language of the people, from the history of the nation\" \n\nIn China under Mao's rule it became essential to re-educate artists and composers to turn away from traditional operas that often portrayed imperial China and espoused Buddhist and Confucian morals in their stories. As a result, the Communist Party established an academy for the arts in Yan'an in 1937 which was intended to \"rectify\" the people of the arts and instruct them on how to incorporate the themes and objectives of the Communist Party into their works\n\nWhat has been seen in these countries however, does not conform with Communist views on art and artistic expression before the international Communist movement came to be under the rule of Stalinist bureaucracy.\n\nIn Uzbekistan there has been an increase in television programming that seeks to convey the regime's political and ideological messages. As a way to counter growing Islamic fundamentalism, Uzbek television programming has vilified Islamists through the use of pop videos by a group called Setora, a trio dubbed the \"Tashkent Spice Girls\". Setora's music video tells the story of a young soldier, the boyfriend of one of three girls, who is sent away on a military assignment away from his loved one. Intertwined with this story are scenes of a mother and her children being taken captive by a highly caricatured Islamic extremist. As the video continues the soldier sweeps in to the rescue of the family, dying a hero in the process. The imagery of a mother is often used as a symbol for the state and in this case the state must be protected and preserved from the threat of Islamic extremism.\n\nThe banning of music itself can also be a method of political warfare. This was the case in Afghanistan while the Taliban held power. At the height of the insurgency in southern Somalia, the Islamist group Al-Shabaab also banned music on radio stations it controlled. Rebel outfits were seeking to establish Sharia law within the country and saw eliminating music as a way to purge society of what they deemed \"evil actions\".\n\nMusic has also been used as a successful tool for public diplomacy, the so-called \"softer\" side of political warfare. One common technique employed by the United States Information Agency (USIA), once the center of the United States' entire public diplomacy strategy, was to arrange for musical exchanges. This was often done by scheduling tours of notable American musicians to foreign countries, especially those under Communist regimes, as a way to expose the average citizen to Americans and their culture.\n\nAnother way that American music was used in public diplomacy was through radio programming on the Voice of America. Willis Conover's \"Music USA\" jazz programming that exposed foreign audiences to American jazz music through songs, interviews with artists and musicians as well as Conover's color commentary. \"Music USA\" soon became one of VOA's most popular programs.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2395393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2395393", "title": "Nyhavn", "text": "Nyhavn\n\nNyhavn (; New Harbour) is a 17th-century waterfront, canal and entertainment district in Copenhagen, Denmark. Stretching from Kongens Nytorv to the harbour front just south of the Royal Playhouse, it is lined by brightly coloured 17th and early 18th century townhouses and bars, cafes and restaurants. The canal harbours many historical wooden ships.\n\nNyhavn was constructed by King Christian V from 1670 to 1673, dug by Swedish prisoners of war from the Dano-Swedish War 1658–1660. It is a gateway from the sea to the old inner city at Kongens Nytorv (King's Square), where ships handled cargo and fishermens' catch. It was notorious for beer, sailors, and prostitution. Danish author Hans Christian Andersen lived at Nyhavn for some 18 years.\n\nThe first bridge across Nyhavn opened on 6 February 1875. It was a temporary wooden footbridge. It was replaced by the current bridge in 1912.\nAs ocean-going ships grew larger, Nyhavn was taken over by internal Danish small vessel freight traffic. After World War II land transport took over this role and small vessel traffic disappeared from the Port of Copenhagen, leaving Nyhavn largely deserted of ships.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the Nyhavn Society (Danish: Nyhavnsforeningen) was founded with the aim of revitalising the area. In 1977, Nyhavn was inaugurated as a veteran ship and museum harbour by Copenhagen’s Lord Mayor Egon Weidekamp. In 1980 Nyhavn quay was pedestrianised; it had been used as a parking area in the previous years which had coincided with a dwindling of harbour activities. Since then it has become a popular spot for tourists and locals alike, serving the function of a square according to architects Jan Gehl and Lars Gemzøe.\n\nThe northern side of Nyhavn is lined by brightly coloured townhouses built with wood, bricks, and plaster. The oldest house, at No. 9, dates from 1681.\n\nBetween 1845 and 1864, Hans Christian Andersen lived at No. 67, where a memorial plaque now stands. From 1871-1875 Andersen lived at Nyhavn 18, which currently houses an Andersen-themed souvenir shop.\n\nThe southern side of Nyhavn has lavish mansions lining the canal, including Charlottenborg Palace at the corner of Kongens Nytorv.\n\nNyhavn Veteran Ship and Museum Harbour, occupying the inner section of Nyhavn, between the Nyhavn Bridge and Kongens Nytorv, is lined with old ships. From the foundation of the heritage harbour in 1977, the south side of the canal has been reserved for museum ships owned by the Danish National Museum, which received a donation of carefully restored ships from A. P. Møller, while the northern side of the canal was put at the disposal of the Nyhavn Society and privately owned, still usable wooden ships.\nHarbor ships include:\n\nThe great Memorial Anchor (Danish: Mindeankeret) at the end of Nyhavn, where it meets Kongens Nytorv, is a monument commemorating the more than 1,700 Danish officers and sailors in service for the Navy, merchant fleet or Allied Forces, who sacrificed their lives during World War II. The Anchor was inaugurated in 1951, replacing a temporary wooden cross erected on the spot in 1945, and has a plaque with a monogram of King Frederik VII on it. The Memorial Anchor is from 1872 and was used on the Frigate Fyn (Funen), which was docked at Holmen Naval Base during the Second World War. Every year on May 5 – Denmark’s Liberation day 1945 – an official ceremony is held to honour and commemorate the fallen at the Memorial Anchor.\n\nAlong its northern, sunnier side, Nyhavn is lined with bars and restaurants facing the harbor. Nyhavn serves as a hub of canal tours.\n\nKongens Nytorv metro station is located at the end of Nyhavn, though situated at the far end of the namesake square outside Magasin du Nord. The station is served by both lines M1 and M2 of the Copenhagen Metro.\n\nThe Copenhagen Harbour Buses has a stop at the mouth of Nyhavn. All four routes of the harbour buses, Routes 901, 902, 903 and 904, stop at the bus stop next to the Royal Playhouse.\n\nIn 2016 the Inner Harbor Bridge (Inderhavnsbro) connecting Nyhavn and Christianshavn was opened after years of setbacks and delays. The 180 m cycling and pedestrian drawbridge has been nicknamed the Kissing Bridge because its contour resembles two tongues meeting.\n\n\nNyhavn has also been featured in a number of international films.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was to be opened for the first time on 1 May 1986, in time for the May Day celebrations, but these plans were cancelled on 26 April, when the Chernobyl disaster occurred a few kilometers away. Several sources report that the park was opened for a short time on 27 April before the announcement to evacuate the city was made, and one site shows photos of the amusement park in operation. Theories that the park was hurriedly opened in the aftermath of the accident to distract Pripyat residents from the unfolding disaster nearby seem to be substantiated by the fact that some of the rides were never fully completed (the Paratrooper was not fitted with canopies and the Ferris wheel's cladding was incomplete). In any case, the park—and its Ferris wheel in particular—have become a symbol of the Chernobyl disaster.\n\nConstructed under the Soviet Union as a \"\" (Park of Culture and Rest) typical of many large cities in the then Soviet Union, the amusement park's attractions were manufactured by the Yeysk-based firm \"\" (Attraction), who were responsible for the construction of many of the amusement parks which remain to be seen around the former Soviet Union today in various states of repair.\n\nLocated north-west to the Palace of Culture in the center of Pripyat, the park had five attractions:\nThe successor to the original company are still manufacturing the Ferris wheel, paratrooper and bumper cars to largely unaltered designs as of 2017.\n\nRadiation levels around the park vary.

{"id": "552107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=552107", "title": "Psychic surgery", "text": "Psychic surgery\n\nPsychic surgery is a pseudoscientific medical fraud in which the practitioner creates the illusion of performing surgery with his or her bare hands and uses trickery, fake blood, and animal parts to convince the patient that the diseased lesions have been removed and that the incision has spontaneously healed.\n\nIt has been denounced by the US Federal Trade Commission as a \"total hoax\", and the American Cancer Society maintains that psychic surgery may cause needless death by keeping the ill away from life-saving medical care. Medical professionals and skeptics classify it as sleight of hand and any positive results as a placebo effect. It first appeared in the Spiritualist communities of the Philippines and Brazil in the middle of the 20th century, and it has taken different paths in those two countries.\n\nAlthough psychic surgery varies by region and practitioner, it usually follows some common lines. Without the use of a surgical instrument, a practitioner will press the tips of his/her fingers against the patient's skin in the area to be treated. The practitioner's hands appear to penetrate into the patient's body painlessly and blood seems to flow. The practitioner will then show organic matter or foreign objects apparently removed from the patient's body, clean the area, and then end the procedure with the patient's skin showing no wounds or scars.\n\nMost cases do not involve actual surgery although some practitioners make real incisions. In regions of the world where belief in evil spirits is prevalent, practitioners will sometimes exhibit objects, such as glass, explaining that the foreign bodies were placed in the patient's body by evil spirits.\n\nAccounts of psychic surgery started to appear in the Spiritualist communities of the Philippines and Brazil in the mid-1900s.\n\nIn the Philippines, the procedure was first noticed in the 1940s, when performed routinely by Eleuterio Terte. Terte and his pupil Tony Agpaoa, who was apparently associated with the \"Union Espiritista Christiana de Filipinas\" (The Christian Spiritist Union of the Philippines), trained others in this procedure.\n\nIn 1959, the procedure came to the attention of the U. S. public after the publication of \"Into the Strange Unknown\" by Ron Ormond and Ormond McGill. The authors called the practice \"fourth dimensional surgery,\" and wrote \"[we] still don’t know what to think; but we have motion pictures to show it wasn’t the work of any normal magician, and could very well be just what the Filipinos said it was — a miracle of God performed by a fourth dimensional surgeon.\"\n\nIn \"...1973, a group of medical doctors, scientists, and parapsychologists visited the Philippine Islands to study a phenomenon that was causing increased furor amongst health professionals ... Filipino psychic surgeons, also known as spiritual/magnetic healers.\"\n\nAlex Orbito, who became well known in the United States through his association with actress Shirley MacLaine was one said practitioner of the procedure. On June 14, 2005, Orbito was arrested by Canadian authorities and indicted for fraud. On Jan 20, 2006, the charges were dropped as it then seemed unlikely that Orbito would be convicted.\n\nPsychic surgery made U.S. tabloid headlines in March 1984 when entertainer Andy Kaufman, diagnosed with large cell carcinoma (a rare lung cancer), traveled to the Philippines for a six-week course of psychic surgery. Practitioner Jun Labo claimed to have removed large cancerous tumors and Kaufman declared he believed this cancer had been removed. Kaufman died from renal failure as consequence of a metastatic lung cancer, on May 16, 1984.\n\nThe origins of the practice in Brazil are obscure; but by the late 1950s \"spiritual healers\" were practicing in the country. Many of them were associated with Spiritism, a major spiritualistic movement in Brazil and claimed to be performing their operations merely as channels for spirits of deceased medical doctors.\n\nA known Brazilian psychic healer who routinely practiced psychic surgery was Zé Arigó, who claimed to be channeling for a deceased medical doctor of name Dr. Fritz. Unlike most other psychic healers, who work bare-handed, Arigó used a non-surgical blade. Other psychic healers who claimed to channel for Dr. Fritz were Edson Queiroz and Rubens Farias Jr.. Popular today (especially abroad) is João de Faria, also known as João de Deus, a quack operating in Abadiânia, state of Goiás.\n\nAccording to the descriptions of Yoshiaki Omura, Brazilian psychic surgery appears to be different from that practiced in the Philippines. Omura calls attention to the fact that practitioners in Brazil use techniques resembling Qigong, Shiatsu massage, and chiropractic manipulation. Some patients are also injected with a brown liquid, and alleged minor surgery was performed in about 20% of the cases observed. While Arigó performed his procedures using kitchen knives in improvised settings, Omura reports that the clamping of blood vessels and the closing of the surgical wounds are now performed by licensed surgeons or licensed nurses.\n\nIn the 1970s a specific form of surgery known as psychic dentistry emerged in America. Willard Fuller was the most well known proponent. It was alleged that Fuller could cause dental fillings to appear spontaneously, change silver into golden fillings, straighten crooked teeth or produce new teeth. However, magicians and skeptics have found these claims to be unsupported by solid evidence. One dentist examined some patients of Fuller. In one case miraculous gold fillings turned out to be tobacco stains. In another case a female patient who reported a miraculous new silver filling admitted she had forgotten that the filling was already there.\n\nIn 1975, the Federal Trade Commission declared that \"'psychic surgery' \"is nothing but a total hoax\".\" Judge Daniel H. Hanscom, when granting the FTC an injunction against travel agencies promoting psychic surgery tours, declared: \"Psychic surgery is pure and unmitigated fakery. The 'surgical operations' of psychic surgeons ... with their bare hands are simply phony.\"\n\nIn 1975 the FTC stated:\n\nIt has been found that \"psychic surgery\" is pure fakery. The body is not opened, no \"surgery\" is performed with the bare hands or with anything else, and nothing is removed from the body. The entire \"operation\" is an egregious fraud perpetrated by sleight-of-hand and similar tricks and devices.\n\nIn 1990, the American Cancer Society stated that it \"found no evidence that \"psychic surgery\" results in objective benefit in the treatment of any medical condition,\" and strongly urged individuals who are ill not to seek treatment by psychic surgery.\n\nThe British Columbia Cancer Agency \"strongly urges individuals who are ill not to seek treatment by psychic surgeon.\"\n\nWhile not directly hazardous to the patient, the belief in the alleged benefits of psychic surgery may carry considerable risk for individuals with diagnosed medical conditions, as they may delay or forgo conventional medical help, sometimes with fatal consequences.\n\nThe physician William Nolen investigated psychic surgery and his book \"Healing: A Doctor in Search of a Miracle\" (1974) uncovered many cases of fraud. Tony Agpaoa a famous psychic surgeon was several times detected in trickery. Stage magician James Randi says psychic surgery is a sleight of hand confidence trick. He has said that in personal observations of the procedure, and in movies showing the procedures, he can spot sleight-of-hand moves that are evident to experienced stage magicians, but might deceive a casual observer. Randi has replicated the appearance of psychic surgery himself through the use of sleight-of-hand. Professional magician Milbourne Christopher also investigated psychic surgeons at work, and observed sleight of hand. On his A&E show \"Mindfreak\" in the episode \"Sucker,\" illusionist Criss Angel performed \"Psychic Surgery,\" showing first-hand how it may be done (fake blood, plastic bags and chicken livers were used).\n\nRandi says the healer would slightly roll or pinch the skin over the area to be treated. When his flattened hand reaches under the roll of skin, it looks and feels as if the practitioner is actually entering into the patient's body. The healer would have prepared in advance small pellets or bags of animal entrails which would be palmed in his hand or hidden beneath the table within easy reach. This organic matter would simulate the \"diseased\" tissue that the healer would claim to be removing. If the healer wants to simulate bleeding, he might squeeze a bladder of animal blood or an impregnated sponge. If done properly, this procedure may deceive patients and observers. However, some \"psychic surgery\" procedures do not rely solely on the \"sleight of hand\" described, as at least one Brazilian \"surgeon\" also cuts his victims' skin with an unsterilized scalpel to heighten the illusion.\n\nJohn Taylor has written there is no real case for psychic surgery as the explanation of fraud is highly likely in all the operations. The practitioners use sleight of hand techniques to produce blood or blood-like fluids, animal tissue or substitutes, and/or various foreign objects from folds of skin of the patient as part of a confidence trick for financial benefit.\n\nScience writer Terence Hines has written:\n\nThe \"operation\" starts as the hand appears to enter the patient’s belly. This is accomplished by creating an impression in the belly by pushing down and flexing the fingers slowly into a fist—the fingers thus appear to be moving into the belly, but are really simply hidden behind the hand. The blood that further disguises the true movement of the fingers and adds drama to the proceedings can come from two sources. One is a fake thumb, worn over the real thumb and filled with a red liquid. Such a fake thumb is a common magician’s implement. Blood can also be passed to the surgeon in red balloons hidden in cotton the psychic surgeon is using, the cotton and its hidden contents being passed to him by an \"assistant.\" The bits of “tumor” can also be passed to the psychic surgeon this way, or hidden in the false thumb... the \"tumor\" material turns out to be chicken intestines or similar animal remains. The blood is either animal blood or red dye.\n\nTwo \"psychic surgeons\" provided testimony in a Federal Trade Commission trial that, to their knowledge, the organic matter supposedly removed from the patients usually consists of animal tissue and clotted blood.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37514688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37514688", "title": "Psychology of dance", "text": "Psychology of dance\n\nThe psychology of dance is the set of mental states associated with dancing and watching others dance. The term names the interdisciplinary academic field that studies those who do. Areas of research include interventions to increase health for older adults, programs for stimulating children’s creativity, dance movement therapy, mate selection and emotional responses.\n\nContinuous response data provide choreographers information about audiences' perception of their dance material. Matches and mismatches between the choreographer's intention and the audience's response were found by continuously judging the emotions expressed when audience members watched Sue Haeley's \"Fine Line Terrain\". Key moments and intended structural changes described by the choreographer were mapped onto the continuous response data to compare the choreographer's intent and the audience's perception.\n\nSurface features of dance contribute to audience arousal. Audience members continuously indicated their arousal and valence while viewing the Quantum Leap Youth Choreographic Ensemble's \"Landscape: time, place, and identity\" by continuously judging valence and emotion portrayed by the dance. Researchers compared this to choreographic notes about emotions expressed during the piece and found that arousal was related to changes in music and dancer activity.\n\nLaban Movement Analysis categorizes human movement based on the duration of time and tempo changes, the contraction and expansion of limbs and the tension and dynamics of movement. In an experiment, subjects viewed 20 videos of dancers performing the same dance attempting to convey anger, fear, grief or joy. Viewers performed at an above-chance level for all but one performance of grief. The highest recognition rate was for grief, followed by anger, then joy. An automated recognition system attempted to find movement cues for different emotions. Fear was expressed with low fluency and many contractions in toward the body, joy with very fluent motion, and grief with frequent transitions between motion and pauses, reducing fluency. The extracted cues were validated by the spectators' recognition of the different emotions in movement and the dancers' performing the emotions similarly.\n\nObservers picked up emotion even without facial expressions. Raters with no dance experience watched videos of a dancer performing movement with seven different motives and six emotions, but with a neutral face. Raters employed a list of motive terms including happy, lonely, sharp, natural, solemn, dynamic and flowing. They assessed emotional intensity on a scale of one to four concerning happiness, surprise, loneliness, fear, anger and disgust. All the intended emotions and motives were perceived, showing that attempts to communicate emotion and motivation via movement can succeed.\n\nIndividuals participating in dance therapy identify feelings similar to those observing the activity. Participants attempted each posture after viewing a photograph or a model in the posture. Participants noted the emotion they associated with each posture. Responses were the same whether the subject was observing or embodying the posture, except for anger. Movers noted an anger response more often than observers.\n\nFour-, five-, and eight-year-old children and adults watched videos of movement expressing joy, anger, fear and sadness and indicated which emotions they perceived in each video. All age groups achieved recognition scores above chance level. The four-year-olds had the lowest scores, while the five-year-olds achieved levels close to the eight-year-olds' and the adults' scores.\n\nUntrained, frequent spectators and novices of ballet or Indian dance watched videos of ballet, Indian dance, and non-dance soloists. Motor-potentials (MEPs) in their hands and arms were used to measure corticospinal excitability. In ballet, the arms are used frequently, while the hands are used in Indian dance. Participants had higher MEPs in their arms when watching ballet compared to Indian dance. Ballet spectators' visual experience, not motor experience, drove motor resonance.\n\nDancers have more accurate position sense than non-dancers allowing them to rely more on position sense than vision. Experts, amateurs and novices differ in their mental representations based on spatial parameters. Subjects in each group viewed clips of basic classical ballet steps and noted the spatial parameters of basic action concepts (BACs), which are mental representations of each part of a movement. For the pas assemblé, amateurs and experts clustered the movement into functional phases, but for the pirouette, only experts had adequate spatial parameters. This suggests that experts retain spatial parameters in their long-term memory and that dancers use mental imagery to memorize long complex phrases.\n\nDancers think in different modes, remember complex movement and respond to the other dancers. Communication between dancers occurs through direct perception of motion, recognition of structure and neural mirroring. Dancers' memory includes procedural knowledge of how to move their bodies and declarative knowledge of specific combinations. Thus, dance is similar to language, where grammar depends on procedural memory and memory of words depends on declarative memory. Dance also involves feelings and personal experience.\n\nEach contemporary dancer has a moving identity as a result of a collection of choreographic and training influences that reveals a personal narrative.\n\nOne Duke University study found that dancers learn routines in different ways, whether by dancing at half speed or in their minds.\n\nA study has found that participating in synchronised dancing facilitates group bonding and higher pain thresholds more so than participating in unsynchronised dancing together.\n\nEmpathy mediates cognition in dance improvisation. Through understanding others' emotions and intentions, dancers make affective motor decisions. Improvised movement is based on embodied cognition, the theory that the body reveals the nature of the mind, motor cognition, that cognition is embodied in action, social cognition, dancers' understanding of others' actions and emotions, and situated cognition, that knowing is inseparable from action. Mirror neurons underlie many movements, allowing dancers to subconsciously respond to stimuli from the other dancers. Empathy provides temporary structuring of movements, which allows contact improvisation to be a kind of choreography.\n\nEmotions were shown to affect creativity through arousal and valence interactions for subjects playing the video game \"Dance Dance Revolution\". Participants were randomly assigned to three different levels of exertion, representing levels of arousal. While the participants danced, an experimenter randomly gave them either a very bad grade or a very good grade, attempting to affect the subject's mood. After dancing, the participants were tested on valence, mood, arousal, creativity and level of physical and mental energy. Lower arousal levels resulted in higher creativity scores when a negative mood was induced. With higher arousal levels, a positive mood resulted in greater creativity than a negative mood.\n\nDance employs emotion, creativity, cultural influence and symbolism to convey meaning. Dance resembles verbal language because it has a vocabulary (dance movements) and grammar (system for combining movements). Dance increases connectedness among students and between students and teachers in the classroom. In schools students can enhance bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, reorganize neural pathways to improve learning, and express knowledge through dance.\n\nDance helps students to develop a sense of self as an emotional and social being. In preschool, children developed language, movement and collaborative skills to express their ideas. They created and named poses, learned ways of breathing to apply in different emotional situations, mirrored others' movements, incorporated emotions into their movement and participated in free movement. Children enhanced their social cognition and raised their awareness of their bodies.\n\nDementia patients who participated in a dance movement therapy (DMT) intervention showed improved cognition compared to a control group. The intervention group participated in nine thirty- to forty-minute sessions of dance movement therapy. The control and intervention groups completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Word List savings score, the instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and the Clock Drawing Test a week before, immediately before, at week five, at week nine and four weeks after the intervention. MMSE scores improved in the DMT group at follow-up and IADL scores improved in the DMT group at week 9. The changes were small, but intervention-related improvements in visuospatial ability were found.\n\nAn aerobic dance program improved older adults' executive function. Participants were assigned to a freestyle workout, which involved patterns of movement, or a combination style workout, in which they learned a long choreographic routine. Their cognitive function was tested immediately before and after the forty-minute dance class with a task-switching reaction time test. Performance improved in the combination group after the program, while there was no change in the freestyle group.\n\nA jazz dance class study was conducted to improve older adults' balance, cognition and mood. These were measured with the MMSE, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Sensory Organization Test (SOT), respectively before (time 1), at the midpoint (time 2), and after (time 3) the class. Differences in MMSE and GDS scores were not significant, but SOT scores increased from time 1 to time 2 and from time 2 to time 3.\n\nCharles Darwin suggested that dance is a signal for natural selection in courtship. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) measures quality of dancing, where higher scores indicate lower quality. Higher FA individuals are less attractive. They are more likely to engage with other FA individuals. A motion capture study of videos of Jamaican dancers, altered to make the dancers unrecognizable used FA ratings to categorize the dancers. Male and female subjects assessed dancing ability and identified the dancer's sex. Symmetrical dancers were rated as significantly better than others, but female symmetry accounted for less than it did in males. Female evaluators more strongly preferred symmetrical male dancers than male evaluators, while there was no gender difference in ratings of female dancers. Lower FA male evaluators were less likely to prefer dances performed by symmetrical females.\n\nMate preference occurs when women perceive risk-taking in men from motion cues in dance. Non-professional heterosexual male dancers completed the Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS-V) assessing their attitudes towards risky activities, thrill-seeking, partying and sexual activities. Women viewed videos of them dancing alone in a room and rated them on perceived risk-taking and perceived attractiveness. Mean attractiveness ratings of the dancers correlated positively with their mean risk-taking and sensation seeking ratings.\n"}

A PlayStation Vita port was released on June 26, 2018, as a cross-buy title with the PlayStation 4 version.\n\nThe game involves a constantly-rotating limousine which the player has to drive around an open world while completing miscellaneous objectives such as pick up and dropping people off or finding collectible items. The gameplay has been described as inspired by \"Kuru Kuru Kururin\" (where you also control a constantly-rotating vehicle), and \"Crazy Taxi\" (where the goal of the game is to drive NPCs from one location to another).\n\nRoundabout is set in 1977 and follows the adventures of Georgio Manos; the world's first revolving limousine driver who drives around the citizens of the city of Roundabout on their daily needs. Though most of the jobs are unrelated and commuters are only seen once or twice, frequent passenger Elizabeth earns Georgio's deep admiration, and a romance begins to develop between the two.\n\nEventually Georgio develops a rivalry with another revolving limousine driver, Ronaldo, whom Georgio unknowingly taught everything they knew and allowed Ronaldo to overtake Georgio as the #1 revolving limousine driver in the city. Desperate to defeat Ronaldo, Georgio acquires some candy dots with the help of Mickey the mechanic, which allows Georgio to see Jeffrey the Skeleton. Guided by Jeffrey in a candy-dot fuelled frenzy, Georgio goes on a murderous rampage through the city. Georgio then challenges Ronaldo again, spurred on by Elizabeth, and as they race through the city streets Georgio runs Ronaldo off the road, destroying his car and killing him.\n\nSix months later, Georgio has retreated to the mountains in the north out of shame, as destroying someone else's car is akin to treason in Roundabout. Having lost Elizabeth and running low on candy dots, Jeffrey urges Georgio to get their act back together and win back Elizabeth's heart. At the same time, Georgio is hounded by Ge-op (Georgio Operations), a police squad tasked with hunting down Georgio after they killed Ronaldo. In the end, Georgio and Elizabeth are reunited, and Elizabeth explains that she is tired of Georgio's constant spinning, pleading Georgio to drive straight for even a little while. After Georgio awkwardly attempts to drive straight, Elizabeth decides that she shouldn't force Georgio to be someone they're not, and the two drive off into the sunset together.\n\nThe game received positive reviews upon release. The versions for each console received different scores despite being identical to each other.\n"}

Dudley, and less frequently as Frank Kernell, was an American singer, pioneer recording artist, and music business executive. He was unrelated to the black vaudeville performer and impresario Sherman Houston Dudley.\n\nHe was born in Greencastle, Indiana, the son of a music teacher. After leaving school he found work as a baritone in touring light opera companies, and from the mid 1880s — with his wife, Sofia Romani, a soprano — toured the US, Mexico and South America as a member of the Emma Juch and Marie Tavary operatic ensembles.\n\nHe continued to perform opera until 1896, when he began recording for the Berliner and Edison companies, both as a solo performer and as a member of vocal groups. On recordings he used the pseudonym S. H. Dudley, perhaps deliberately using the name of the black vaudeville performer Sherman H. Dudley who was becoming popular at that time. Rous later claimed he was ignorant of the \"real\" S. H. Dudley's existence.\n\nHe principally recorded for Victor Records. As a solo singer, using the name Dudley, he often recorded \"coon songs\" and other stereotypical minstrel show material. One of his biggest commercial successes was his recording of \"When Reuben Comes To Town\" in 1901. He recorded the song \"Whistling\", a skill for which he was noted, and comic songs such as \"Miss Helen Hunt\", with the mildly risqué line \"Go to Helen Hunt for it\". He also recorded as a duo with Harry Macdonough.\n\nHe was an integral member of the Edison Male Quartet, which became The Haydn Quartet, along with Harry Macdonough, John Bieling, and William F. Hooley. The group was one of the most popular of the period, and had a number of successes including \"In the Good Old Summer Time\" (1903), \"Bedelia\" (1904), \"Sweet Adeline (You're the Flower of My Heart)\" (1904), \"How'd You Like To Spoon With Me\" (with Corinne Morgan, 1906), \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" (with Billy Murray, 1908), \"Sunbonnet Sue\" (1908), \"Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet\" (1909), and \"By the Light of the Silv'ry Moon\" (with Murray, 1910). On some of the group's later recordings, he was replaced by Reinald Werrenrath.\n\nIn 1902, Sam Rous, using his real name, was appointed as assistant manager of Victor Records' artists and repertoire division. He gave the company's star singer Billy Murray the sobriquet \"The Denver Nightingale\". Rous continued to record for several years, both as Dudley and using the pseudonym Frank Kernell, but at a much reduced level. He was also the first editor of Victor's record catalog, the \"Victor Book of the Opera\" (or \"Victrola Book of the Opera\"), first published in 1912. This contained illustrated details of the plots and production histories of operas, and cataloged available Victor recordings of them. The book went through many editions, and remained in print until 1976.\n\nHe retired in 1919, and with his wife went to live in France. They returned to the US shortly before World War Two, and lived in California. Rous died in Los Angeles in 1947, at the age of 83; his wife, who had been paralysed for several years, died the next day.\n\n"}

Canuto and Xu Xiaoxi. Produced by Almost Red Productions in association with Arkadin Ed. and filmed in Sichuan, China.\n\nIt is the last part of the trilogy Invisible Chengdu (aka \"El Chengdu Invisible\" (Spanish)), a series of short films filmed in Sichuan (China) and using the local language of the region, the Sichuanese Mandarin. The trilogy reflects the underground scene of Chengdu. It includes also the films Floating Melon (2015) and (2013) and narrates stories about characters that usually are segregated and that must survive in the shadows of the city, since the Chinese society is contrary to diversity and individuality.\n\nSet on a contemporary city of China, it follows Li Wanjing, a transgender woman that must return to her birthplace village in the mountains after knowing the decease of her mother, since she must arrange the funeral, but she cannot present herself with her new identity in front of family members and friends. The film is performed by Gu Xiang, a non-professional actor that face his first performance with this movie. Also in the role of Wang Dandan is Yu Yinmeng (that performed in a previous film of the directors, Floating Melon), Tian Peng and Li Lierong.\n\nSunken Plum pretends to grasp the life of the transgender community in the Chinese society. In the words of the directors, \"We hope that with time things will start to change and these groups start to get the respect and rights that they deserve.\". In Sunken Plum they try to represents some of the many difficulties that have a transgender woman in China. If focuses in the family relationships and the different treatment they receive between the cities and the villages.\n\nFilming took place in September and October 2016 in Sichuan (China), and the post-production process was completed in October 2017 in Asturias, Spain. Distributed by Laboral Cinemateca, a company from the government of Principado de Asturias, Sunken Plum had its world premiere at the 62nd Seminci, Valladolid International Film Festival on the 24 of October 2017. It participates that year also in Spain at the 22th LesGaiCineMad, Madrid International LGBT Film Festival and the 55th FICX, Gijón International Film Festival, where obtained the \"Laboral Cinemateca Award\", that consist in the distribution of the movie at international film festivals.\n\nThe international premiere took place in April 2018 at the 9th LGBT film festival in Poland. In the following six months, it is presented in over 25 countries, participating in two festivals that qualify for the pre-selection of the Academy Awards (Oscar) for Best Short Film: the 36th Outfest Los Angeles Film Festival and the 26th Raindance Film Festival in London (UK), The film obtained various awards and mentions through the year 2018.\n\n\nA transgender woman, who works in a nightclub in Chengdu, receives an unexpected visit from her cousin, who tells her that her mother (whom she didn't see for a long time) is deceased. As the only son, she feels obligated to return to her birthplace, but can not appear as a woman in front of her family.\n\nThe films start the pre-production process in summer 2016. The directors mention that \"The production process was very complicated because it was not possible to obtain help from official institutions, neither from private funds because this type of works cannot have a normal distribution in China\". It was partially financed by a crowdfunding project. \"Many people collaborate, knowing that our intention was to bring attention towards the difficulties and the injustice that the LGBT community and in special the trans community suffer in the Chinese society. For that reason, this project is very special for us\".\n\nProduced by Almost Red Productions in association with Arkadin Ed (Spain), the filming took place in China. Being a co-production, in the practice, it is just a Spanish film, not only because the main founds of the film came from Spain, but also because the film cannot be distributed in China, due to the strict censorship of the audiovisual exhibition in the country.\n\nThe script was written by the directors, Roberto F. Canuto and Xu Xiaoxi. The idea behind the story came after the directors view some videos that were shared in social networks in China, but that was censored in a few hours. The videos portray the physical and psychological abuse of some transgender women. The directors mention: \"we were surprided that these videos were shared in a playful and entertaining manner. Knowing the great difficulties that this community must face to have a dignified life, lacking legal protection and suffering the contempt of a good part of society, we decided to write this story to draw attention to this unfair situation\".\n\nAccording to the directors, they \"try to create a story with a simple and direct narrative, but with an important emotional charge, so that the viewer feels empathy with the main character and understands her inner world. Our wish would be that this short film could be seen both by the kind of people who shared those videos for fun, as well as by the archetype of people who are represented in the village, who are completely unaware of the existence of transsexuality and, therefore, they can not accept it\".\n\nThe filming process of Sunken Plum took place between the middle of September until 9 October 2016 in Sichuan (China).\n\nThe locations of the filming were the center of Chengdu, the lake \"Bai Ta\" and a village in the mountains of Sichuan, \"Nan Bu\". The main problem, regarding locations, was to find a suitable village that allow the production team to shoot a scene related to funerals. The superstitions, specially related to dead, are very strong in the countryside of China. The village that was use, \"Bai Ta\", is located five hours from Chengdu city, in the mountains, and the team needed to drive dangerous roads to reach the remote place.\n\nSunken Plum is performed by non professional actors and some scenes required many extras. The main character is performed by the male actor Gu Xiang, that perform a complex character, \"Li Wanying\", a transgender person with strong family conflicts.\nRegarding the casting process, the director Roberto F. Canuto mention that they “\"try to find a transgender actress to perform the main role, but it was not possible. Finally, we choose a non-professional actor, but that had some of the qualities and the passion that we were looking for, and we thougtn he will give a true personality and spontaneity to the role\"”. Gu Xiang interview some transgender women and rehearse the scenes few months with the directors until he felt ready to affront the shooting.\nAmong the members of the crew it had usually collaborators of the directors, like the producer \"Leng Zhiwen\" and the director of photography \"Guo Yong\", with whom they already collaborate in their previous Chinese short film, Floating Melon.\nThe music will be composed by the multi-awarded Italian-American composer Andrea Centazzo, being \"Sunken Plum\" the seventh collaboration with the directors.\n\nThe world premiere and national release of the film took place on the 24 of October 2017 at the 62 SEMINCI, Valladolid International Film Festival, and the international premiere in April 2018 at the 9th LGBT film festival in Poland.

They are stationary and silent, usually in costume, carefully posed, with props and/or scenery, and may be theatrically lit. It thus combines aspects of theatre and the visual arts.\n\nA tableau may either be 'performed' live, or depicted in painting, photography and sculpture, such as in many works of the Romantic, Aesthetic, Symbolist, Pre-Raphaelite, and Art Nouveau movements.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, tableaux sometimes featured ('flexible poses') by virtually nude models, providing a form of erotic entertainment, both on stage and in print.\n\nTableaux continue to the present day in the form of living statues, street performers who busk by posing in costume.\n\nOccasionally, a Mass was punctuated with short dramatic scenes and painting-like . They were a major feature of festivities for royal weddings, coronations and royal entries into cities. Often the actors imitated statues or paintings, much in the manner of modern street entertainers, but in larger groups, and mounted on elaborate temporary stands along the path of the main procession.\n\nThe history of Western visual arts in general, until the modern era, has had a focus on symbolic, arranged presentation, and (aside from direct personal portraiture) was heavily dependent on stationary artists' models in costume – essentially small-scale with the artist as temporary audience. The Realism movement, with more naturalistic depictions, did not begin until the mid-19th century, a direct reaction against Romanticism and its heavy dependence on stylized format.\n\nBefore radio, film and television, were popular forms of entertainment, even in frontier towns. Before the age of color reproduction of images, the was sometimes used to recreate artworks on stage, based on an etching or sketch of a painting. This could be done as an amateur venture in a drawing room, or as a more professionally produced series of presented on a theatre stage, one following another, usually to tell a story without requiring all the usual trappings and production of a full theatre performance. They thus influenced the form taken by later Victorian and Edwardian era magic lantern shows, and perhaps also sequential narrative comic strips (which first appeared in modern form in the late 1890s).\n\nTheatrical censorship in Britain and the United States forbade actresses to move when nude or semi-nude on stage, so had a place in risqué entertainment for many years. In the early 1900s, German dancer Olga Desmond appeared in \"Schönheitsabende\" ('Evenings of Beauty') in which she posed nude in \"living pictures\", imitating classical works of art.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, took such titles as \"Nymphs Bathing\" and \"Diana the Huntress\" and were to be found at such places as the Hall of Rome in Great Windmill Street, London. Other venues were the Coal Hole in the Strand and the Cyder Cellar in Maiden Lane. Nude and semi-nude were also a frequent feature of variety shows in the US: first on Broadway in New York City, then elsewhere in the country. The Ziegfeld Follies featured such from 1917. The Windmill Theatre in London (1932–1964) featured nude on stage; it was the first, and for many years the only, venue for them in 20th-century London.\n\nJean-François Chevrier was the first to use the term in relation to a form of art photography, which began in the 1970s and 1980s in an essay titled \"The Adventures of the Picture Form in the History of Photography\" in 1989. The initial translation of this text substitutes the English word \"picture\" for the French word . However Michael Fried retains the French term when referring to Chevrier's essay, because according to Fried (2008), there is no direct translation into English for in this sense. While \"picture\" is similar, \"... it lacks the connotations of constructedness, of being the product of an intellectual act that the French word carries.\" (p. 146)\nOther texts and Clement Greenberg's theory of medium specificity also cover this topic.\n\nThe key characteristics of the contemporary photographic according to Chevrier are, firstly:\n\nBy this, Chevrier notes that scale and size is obviously important if the pictures are to \"hold the wall\". But size has another function; it distances the viewer from the object, requiring one to stand back from the picture to take it all in. This \"confrontational\" experience, Fried notes, is actually quite a large break from the conventional reception of photography, which up to that point was often consumed in books or magazines.\n\nThe photographic has its roots not in the theatrical , but in pictorialist photography, such as that of Alfred Stieglitz, a movement with its roots in Aestheticism, which already made heavy use of the as a non-theatrical visual art style. Pictorialism, according to Jeff Wall could be seen as an attempt by photographers to imitate painting (perhaps unsuccessfully):\n\nHowever photography did have the ability to unpredictable and spontaneous. This was achieved by making photographs related to the inherent capabilities of the camera itself. And this, Wall argues, was a direct result of photojournalism, and the mass media and pop culture industries. \"By divesting itself of the encumbrances and advantages inherited from older art forms, reportage, or the spontaneous fleeting aspect of the photographic image pushes toward a discovery of qualities apparently intrinsic to the medium, qualities that must necessarily distinguish the medium from others and through the self-examination of which it can emerge as a modernist art on a plane with others.\" (p. 76-78)\n\nThe argument is that, unlike most other art forms, photography can profit from the capture of chance occurrences. Through this process – the snapshot, the \"accidental\" image – photography invents its own concept of the picture. A hybrid form of the \"Western picture\" (pictorialist photography) and the spontaneous snapshot. This is the stage whereby Wall argues that photography enters a \"modernist dialectic\". Wall claims that unpredictability is key to modern aesthetics. This new concept of the picture, which Wall proposes, with the compositional aspects of the Western picture combined with the unpredictability that the camera affords through its shutter, can be seen in the work of many contemporary photographic artists including Luc Delahaye, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Struth, Irene Caesar, and Philip-Lorca diCorcia.\n\nThe tableau as a form still dominates the art photography market. As Fried notes: \"Arguably the most decisive development in the rise of the new art photography has been the emergence, starting in the late 1970s and gaining impetus in the 1980s and after, of what the French critic Jean-François Chevrier has called the \"tableau form\" (p. 143)\n\nHowever, there appears to be only a handful of young, emerging artists working within the tableau form. Examples include Florian Maier Aichen, Matthew Porter and Peter Funch. More recently, Canadian artist, Sylvia Grace Borda, has worked since 2013 to continue to stage tableaux for the camera within the Google Street View engine. Her work creates 360' immersive tableaux vivant images for the viewer to explore. Through her efforts to pioneer the tableaux vivant for online exploration, she and her collaborator, John M Lynch, won the Lumen Prize 2016 for Web Arts.\n\nThe 2013 film, \"A Field in England\", makes use of the effect to add to the general occult look of the film.\n\nThere is a 2014 feature film produced entirely in tableau format titled \"In the Crosswind\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is his second autobiographical album with lyricist Bernie Taupin, picking up where 1975's \"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\" left off. \"The Captain & the Kid\" chronicles the events in their lives over those subsequent 30 years.\n\n\"The Captain & the Kid\" reached No. 6 in the UK, a considerable improvement over the performance of John's preceding \"Peachtree Road\" in 2004, which peaked at No. 21. It reached No. 18 in the US, before quickly falling off the charts. At concerts in early 2007, John made clear his dissatisfaction with Interscope's promotion for the album, having threatened to terminate his contract with the label.\n\nInterscope Records announced that there would be no physical single released from this album as the emphasis is on presenting the album as a body of work. However, a radio single would be released in \"The Bridge\". The album's booklet has photos of John and Taupin all throughout their career, and in the lyrics section, two songs are included, \"Across the River Thames\" and \"12\", which do not appear on the music album. \"Across the River Thames\" was available as a free download to anyone inserting the CD into their computer. This is the first album created by John and Taupin to have them both together on the cover. This was the last studio album to feature Guy Babylon on keyboards; he died in 2009 and was replaced by Kim Bullard. This was also Bob Birch's last appearance on any of John's solo studio albums before his own death in August 2012 (Birch last appeared on the \"Gnomeo and Juliet\" soundtrack).\n\nAll songs written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin.\n\n\n\n\n\nProducer Matt Still noted during an interview that in \"Just Like Noah's Ark\", Elton's black and white spaniel dog Arthur \"barked in the middle of [the recording], because John Mahon was playing a cowbell, and the cowbell freaked him out. So he ran over to John and started barking at him right in the middle of a take. It's funny, just randomly he happened to hit the beats and he barked in time. So I recorded it and we actually kept him in there.\"\n\nThe sampled \"woof-bells\" can be heard in place of the cowbell on the track.\n\n"}

The company also\nproduces events and runs training programmes for artists and young people.The company is based in London, England and Le Buisson-de-Cadouin, France.\n\nThe Generating Company founder, Paul Cockle, was Production Manager for the Millennium Dome Show directed by Peter Gabriel, Mark Fisher and Micha Bergese, in 1998 to create a show for the Millennium Experience, a exhibition hosted at the Millennium Dome to welcome the third millennium. The team turned to Circus Space, now the National Centre for Circus Arts, which was the first centre in the UK to offer a degree in circus arts. With little more than a year until opening night, Circus Space formed an accredited programme and trained 87 aerial performers for the Dome show.\n\nThe Dome show premiered on New Year's Eve, 1999. While the Dome itself was mired in controversy and financial woes, the show opened to critical success. With only a year-long contract at the Dome, many of the show's performers considered a return to Circus Space to continue their careers. When the show closed at the end of 2000, about 20 of the performers returned to Circus Space to form The Generation Company, a small traveling company that retained many of the characteristics of the original Dome performance.\n\nFollowing their success at the Dome and Circus Space, The Generating Company received a £70,000 grant from the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts and grants from the Arts Council England to begin a touring company. After a local show, Storm, performed at Circus Space in Hoxton, The Generating Company began pursuing a \"fusion of professional training with an extended performance contract linked to future touring opportunities.\" It opened its first school in 2002, offering summer courses devised for children interested in circus skills. It also hosted programs at Trinity Buoy Wharf through 2009.\n\nIn 2008, The Generating Company moved the majority of its professional schooling and develop a creative centre at Le Buisson-de-Cadouin, France. Paul Cockle explained that setting up the company in France offered the chance to develop a residential centre where artists can live and work together.. The Generating Company still has administration offices in London but its core operation is based in France.\n\nThe Generating Company successfully appeared on the \"Dragons' Den\" in December 2005. Represented by Paul Cockle, Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis decided to invest in the company. Together they invested £160,000 into the company and own a 40% stake.\n\n"}
{"id": "55760042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55760042", "title": "The Problem with Apu", "text": "The Problem with Apu\n\nThe Problem with Apu is a 2017 documentary film written by and starring comedian Hari Kondabolu and produced and directed by Michael Melamedoff. The film focuses on the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, an Indian immigrant in the animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\" who, for a period, was the only figure of South Asian heritage to appear regularly on mainstream U.S. television. The film explores encounters with negative stereotypes, racial microaggressions and slurs against people of Indian and South Asian heritage disseminated through the character.\n\nKondabolu grew up watching \"The Simpsons\" and cites it as a major influence on his comedy and cultural savvy. Initially he liked the character Apu because the character was the only representation of his family's culture regularly aired on television in the United States. Kondabolu told the BBC, \"Apu was the only Indian we had on TV at all so I was happy for any representation as a kid.\" As he grew older, Kondabolu became more critical of Apu, saying, \"he's funny, but that doesn’t mean this representation is accurate or right or righteous. It gets to the insidiousness of racism, though, because you don’t even notice it when it’s right in front of you.\"\nAccording to Kondabolu, his mother taught him that \"you can criticize something you love because you expect more from it.\" His first public critique of \"The Simpsons\" character came at the insistence of W. Kamau Bell during the first season of his FX television show \"Totally Biased\". In 2012 Kondabolu worked as a writer on the show, and Bell heard him railing against Apu for fomenting racial stereotypes about Indians. Bell then told Kondabolu that if he did not write it into a stand up comedy routine and perform it on the show, Bell would fire him. In his bit, Kondabolu criticizes voice actor Hank Azaria (who is of Sephardic Jewish descent), calling him \"a white guy doing an impression of a white guy making fun of my father.\" Kondabolu went on to cite other portrayals of South Asians in mainstream television and film—such as a man eating monkey brains in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" and an actor petting a stuffed mongoose in a metroPCS commercial—as racist. Kondabolu eventually decided to expand the one-minute segment about Apu into an hour-long documentary.\n\n\"Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening named Apu after the protagonist of Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray's acclaimed \"Apu Trilogy\". Hank Azaria based his voice characterization of Apu on a clerk who worked at a 7-Eleven near his home in Los Angeles as well as on Peter Sellers' character Hrundi V. Bakshi, an Indian actor, from the film The Party. In a 2015 interview Azaria acknowledged the character's impact as fodder for widespread racially motivated bullying that targets children with South Asian heritage. Kondabolu reached out to Azaria to be interviewed for the film, but Azaria declined for fear that his words would be manipulated by the film's editing process. He agreed to have a discussion facilitated either by Terry Gross on the public radio program \"Fresh Air\" or on Marc Maron's podcast \"WTF\" but according to Kondabolu rescinded his offer once it was accepted.\n\nIn the film Kondabolu speaks with other South Asian-American entertainers about the impact of Apu on their lives. Actors Aziz Ansari, Kal Penn, Maulik Pancholy, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Samrat Chakrabarti, Sakina Jaffrey, Aasif Mandvi and Hasan Minhaj relate childhood anecdotes of being called \"Apu\" by other children or having the character's catchphrases from the show said to them by strangers because of their perceived heritage. They also relate stories of becoming trained professional actors and being asked to deliver lines in the style of Apu.\n\nKondabolu compares this instance of Azaria portraying a caricature of an Indian shopkeeper to blackface and interviews African-American actress Whoopi Goldberg who is a longtime collector of racist ephemera from the 20th and 21st centuries. Goldberg agrees with the interpretation of Apu as a form of brownface. Kondabolu traces the origins of \"The Simpsons\" character to a legacy of brownface performance by actors such as Peter Sellers in \"The Party\".\n\nIn parts of the documentary, Kondabolu expresses his appreciation for \"The Simpsons\" as a subversive and culturally astute institution on the landscape of mainstream North American media. Additionally, he draws out a range of opinions from his peers; for instance, while Kondabolu said that despite Apu he still loved \"The Simpsons\", Kal Penn said the character ruined the show for him. Kondabolu said, \"I made this film to not only talk about the origin of Apu and highlight the impact of such images in media, but also to celebrate the diversity and complexity of my community.\"\n\nFilming for \"The Problem with Apu\" began in April 2016. The film was given special screenings featuring live appearances and talkback with Hari Kondabolu in the fall of 2017, preceding its release on the truTV network on November 19.\n\nKondabolu appeared on \"The Daily Show with Trevor Noah\" to promote the film. He argued that the Apu character had had a serious and insidious effect, and that the use of humor in the portrayal is an artful way of making racism more appealing; this would hypothetically be relieved by the introduction of a range of brown characters.\n\nThe documentary received mostly positive reviews from critics, with review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes ranking the film at 88% out of 17 reviews, with an average critical score of 8/10, and Metacritic assigning a score of 77/100 based on four reviews.\n\nDaniel Fienberg, writing for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", praised the documentary for providing \"its thesis against the character's acceptability ... with such clarity, it's hard to imagine it generating an adversarial response more cogent than that hoary classic 'It's a joke, stop taking it so seriously,' which is no response at all.<nowiki>\"</nowiki> However, Feinberg criticized it as being \"half a documentary\", saying \"it becomes disingenuous when Kondabolu declares, 'I realize some of you think I'm some annoying PC social-justice warrior' and then calculatedly skips those voices, and disappointing when Kondabolu and friends wonder what can be done about Apu now and there's nobody around to make it into a real conversation.\" \n\nScott Pierce of \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" found the documentary \"thought-provoking and entertaining\", and concluded that \"Kondabolu raises some troubling questions. I’ll never be able to watch \"The Simpsons\" without thinking about this again.\" Meenasarani Linde Murugan, writing for the \"Los Angeles Review of Books\", contrasted the documentary's progressive advocacy with the view of media diversity promulgated by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai: \"In celebrating how far we have come, we should not only remember how brownface and brown voice persist on contemporary television, but also call out those public South Asian figures who would use this same history of ridicule to leverage a vision of the future wholly run by corporations that would further racial and economic inequity.\"\n\nJustin Charity, writing for \"The Ringer\", agreed with the film's argument, but found the pursuit of Azaria to appear in the film \"a prevailing distraction from more ambitious consideration of the ideal future of \"The Simpsons\" and the cultural shifts that have rendered Apu increasingly unpalatable.\" He also found the documentary lacked imagination in finding a solution to creating a more nuanced portrayal of Apu: \"that lapse of Kondabolu’s imagination is the documentary’s real waste.\" Neal Justin of \"Minneapolis Star Tribune\" noted \"any criticism directed at the show’s portrayal of the convenience-store owner in his documentary...is drowned out by frustration that he can’t land an interview with the character’s voice actor\"\n\n\"The Simpsons\" episode \"No Good Read Goes Unpunished\", first aired in April 8, 2018, was widely received as a response to Kondabolu's film. In it, Marge finds that a book she loved as a child contains elements that would now be considered offensive, and edits the book herself to remove these elements. In doing this she finds the book loses its \"emotional journey\". She and Lisa then look to a picture of Apu, and Lisa comments that \"something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive, is now politically incorrect. What can you do?\" Kondabolu wrote on Twitter that he was disappointed that the message of his film had been reduced to the concept of \"politically incorrect\". In an interview with \"USA Today\", creator Matt Groening dismissed the criticism of the Apu character, saying \"I think it’s a time in our culture where people love to pretend they’re offended\".\n\n"}
{"id": "34969547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34969547", "title": "Theatre in Argentina", "text": "Theatre in Argentina\n\nBuenos Aires is one of the world's great capitals of theater. The Teatro Colón is a national landmark for opera and classical performances; built at the end of the 19th century, its acoustics are considered the best in the world, and is currently undergoing a major refurbishment in order to preserve its outstanding sound characteristics, the French-romantic style, the impressive Golden Room (a minor auditorium targeted to Chamber Music performances), and the museum at the entrance. With its theatre scene of national and international caliber, Corrientes Avenue is synonymous with the art. It is thought of as \"the street that never sleeps\", and sometimes referred to as the Broadway of Buenos Aires. Many great careers in acting, music, and film have begun in its many theaters. The \"Teatro General San Martín\" is one of the most prestigious, along Corrientes Avenue, and the \"Teatro Nacional Cervantes\" functions as the national stage theater of Argentina. The \"Teatro Argentino de La Plata\", \"El Círculo\" in Rosario, \"Independencia\" in Mendoza, and \"Libertador\" in Córdoba are also prominent. Griselda Gambaro, Copi, Roberto Cossa, Marco Denevi, Carlos Gorostiza, Alberto Vaccarezza and Mauricio Kartun are a few of the more prominent Argentine playwrights. Julio Bocca, Jorge Donn, José Neglia, and Norma Fontenla are some of the great ballet dancers of the modern era.\n\nArgentine theatre traces its origins to Viceroy Juan José de Vértiz y Salcedo's creation of the colony's first theatre, \"La Ranchería\", in 1783. In this stage, in 1786, a tragedy entitled \"Siripo\" had its premiere. \"Siripo\" is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet Manuel José de Lavardén, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the Río de la Plata Basin: the destruction of Sancti Spiritu colony by aboriginals in 1529. \"La Ranchería\" theatre operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage in Buenos Aires was Teatro Coliseo, opened in 1804 during the term of Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte. It was the nation's longest-continuously operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, Blas Parera, earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century. The genre suffered during the regime of Juan Manuel de Rosas, though it flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the Colón Theatre, in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage performances. Antonio Petalardo's successful 1871 gambit on the opening of the Teatro Opera, inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina. \n\nThe 1874 murder of Juan Moreira, a persecuted troubadour, provided dramatists with a new hero. Possessing all the elements of tragedy, the anecdote inspired Eduardo Gutiérrez's 1884 play \"Juan Moreira\", and the work made the gaucho, the inspiration for the Argentine stage in subsequent years. Spanish literature began to overtake the gaucho, following the 1897 relocation to Argentina of Spanish theatre producer María Guerrero, and her company, who popularized professional stage theatre in the country. Making the Teatro Odeón a nerve center for the medium, her evolved stagecraft led to the creation of the national stage, the Cervantes Theatre, in 1921. \n\nThe wave of European Immigration in Argentina created a need for a cultural shift in theatre addressed by Florencio Sánchez, a pioneer in professional theater locally, and in Uruguay. Local color became the primary inspiration for Roberto Arlt, Gregorio de Laferrère, Armando Discépolo, Antonio Cunill Cabanellas, and Roberto Payró during the 1920s and 1930s, while also helping amateur theatre revive locally. The \"Teatro Independiente\" movement created a counterwight to professional theatre, and inspired a new generation of young dramatists in this vein such as Copi, Agustín Cuzzani, Osvaldo Dragún, and Carlos Gorostiza. \n\nGorostiza and other self-trained dramatists also popularized Realism in the Argentine theatre after 1950, a genre advanced by Ricardo Halac, Roberto Cossa, and among others. Griselda Gambaro and Eduardo Pavlovsky popularized the theatre of the absurd in Argentina after 1960, a genre that found local variant in the grotesque works of Julio Mauricio and Roberto Cossa, whose \"La Nona\" became an iconic character in the Argentine theatre in 1977.\n\nArgentina's National Reorganization Process posed the greatest challenge to the development of local theatre since the Rosas era of the mid-19th century. Numerous actors, playwrights and technicians emigrated after 1976, though the pressures on artists were loosen around 1980. Seizing the opportunity, playwright Osvaldo Dragún marshalled colleagues to restore an abandoned sparkplug factory to organize the improvisational Argentine Open Theatre in 1981, a triumph dampened by their Picadero Theatre's fire-bombing a week later.\n\nThe theatre thrived before and after the 1983 return to democracy. Established playwrights and directors such as Norman Briski, Roberto Cossa, Lito Cruz, Carlos Gorostiza, Pacho O'Donnell, and Pepe Soriano, and younger dramatists such as Luis Agostoni, Carlos María Alsina, Eduardo Rovner, and Rafael Spregelburd. Works by these and other local authors, as well as local productions of international works, are among the over 80 theater works presented every weekend in Buenos Aires, alone. The stage also plays host to well-known comedy acts, such as those of satirist Enrique Pinti, female impersonator Antonio Gasalla, storyteller Luis Landriscina, and the musical comedy troupe, Les Luthiers.\n"}
{"id": "1913727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1913727", "title": "Theocracy (video game)", "text": "Theocracy (video game)\n\nTheocracy is a real-time strategy game for the PC developed by Philos Laboratories and published by Ubi Soft in 2000. The game takes place in Mexico and Central America in the 15th century. The player controls a tribe in this region, and has 100 years to prepare for a Spanish invasion by expanding their territory across the Central American map, by conquest, or by allying and trading with other tribes.\n\nIn \"Theocracy\", the player is the leader of the Atlan tribe (a fictional tribe), who has escaped from oppression under the Axocopans, and now must improve his/her tribe in order to survive in Central America. As the player's empire's borders expands, the player is able to conduct diplomacy with other tribes. The player must also eventually defend themself from the invading Spanish.\n\nThe game also allows players to play through several \"Chronicles\", a set of objective-based missions detailing supposed heroes of Aztec history. These mostly serve for tutorial purposes rather than being a serious part of the game however.\n\nThere are two modes of playing: province view, and realm view. \nIn province view, the player view a particular province under their control/attack. Here they assign tasks to their persons, however time stands still here, and the player must go to realm view for time to move and his/her actions to take effect. There is a time-scale in realm view, along with a hand-drawn map of Central America, showing all the province borders, and using colour-code to show which of the eight factions controls it.\nThe player's tribe is represented by the colour blue, while other tribes are red, yellow, green, purple and cobalt. Provinces under control from a random tribe with no possible relations to others are paper-coloured, and provinces controlled by the Spanish (once the Spanish arrive to invade) are grey. Each tribe has a unique 'personality' dictated by its AI; the red tribe the Izhuacans for example are an 'aggressive and warlike theocracy' and will generally be the first tribe to make an aggressive move in the game. The green tribe, the Huaputecs, are more peaceful and will never attack the player unless the player has already initiated hostilities. Tribes also have varying military tactics and units, the Yellow Tribe has an army consisting of almost entirely sword units supported by spearmen, jaguars and nature priests, while the Cyan tribe, the Teotitlans, have enormous crossbow units known as Wonderbows and soul priests supporting their warriors.\nPlayers can also build Aztec-style pyramids to harness the power of magic from the five spheres of Magic: Sun, Star, Moon, Nature and Soul. The amount of magic available to the player is limited and measured in \"Mana\", Mana is used by Priests to cast spells, this Mana can be recharged by performing sacrifices at the Pyramids where priests are trained, the amount of Mana per unit depends on the Unit type. Each sphere of magic has different spells available with a vague focus on a specific type. Sun Priests specialise in attack spells, Moon in defensive ones, Nature Priests in Healing, Star Priests in 'debuff' or distraction and while Soul Priests are equally skilled in all fields.\n\nThe time scale can be used to determine how fast time passes. It can be paused to make time stand still, and at slowest rate, a year passes in approximately 10 or so minutes, and at fastest rate, a year passes in approximately 20 seconds.\n\nEach region can be closely managed in the province view. Here activities can be undertaken such as construction, training and allocation of slaves.\n\nThe majority of the population of each realm is made up of slaves, basic worker units who can undertake any task except fight and transport resources between realms. There are a certain number of new slaves born each year depending on the level of health in the province, how much food the province has and what the current population of the province is.\n\nAs a bare minimum, each province must produce enough food to feed the entire population of the realm. There are two types of food, corn and meat. Corn is produced from small and large farms, and is produced faster and in greater quantity than meat, and is also required to feed llamas. Meat, while taking longer to produce, requires less slaves and is more nutritious than corn, meaning it can feed more people than the same amount of corn. It is therefore more economic to produce meat in a province than corn. Meat is also required to feed tamed jaguars.\n\nThere are a number of different resources that can be used in different ways. The most basic are meat and corn, used to feed people and tamed animals. Next is wood, which every building uses in construction, and is also used to create Wonderbows (similar to ballistas). Also used in construction is stone, which is used to build more advanced buildings. Finally, there is Gold, Jade, and Jewels. Jewels are used as a currency, and to decorate the most advanced buildings. It is made out of Jade and Gold. Either one can be used to create jewels separately, but used together they produce a much greater quantity than when used separately. Corn is produced from small and large farms, meat from ranches (pig farms) and fishing huts. Wood is produced from lumberyards and stone, gold and jade are mined from quarries. Jewels are produced in a workshop from gold and/or jade. There is also mana, however it functions differently from the other resources in that it is used to cast spells, can be accessed anywhere, and is generated from temples in a small continuous trickle. Sacrificing slaves will generate much more and faster, but slaves are the only means of production so they must be sacrificed carefully so as not to ruin the economy of a region. There is a different stockpile of mana for each sphere of magic. \nNote: resources are stored in stockpiles in each region, thus resources for one realm can be used anywhere in that region no matter where they are stored, but must be manually transported to another region in order to be used there. The exceptions are jewels and mana.\n\nThere are a number of different buildings, which can all be broadly categorised into three main types:\n\nThese buildings produce resources, but must be manned to do so. These include ranches and fishing huts, which produce meat, small and large farms, which produce corn, quarries and mines which produce stone, gold and jade and lumberyards, which produce wood.\n\nThese buildings train new types of workers and warriors from slave recruits. They include schools (small, medium and large) which train workers, who speed up production of a particular resource but specialise in that resource. Small schools can train only basic workers, medium schools can train most types of workers and large schools can train any, and train them faster. Small and medium schools can only train one type of worker, but large schools can train every type, but only one at a time. Another type of training building is the barracks: small, medium and large. The small and medium barracks produce warriors from slaves, but can only produce one type of warrior. The medium barracks takes less time to train warriors than the small barracks. The large barracks can produce any of the three types of warriors, but only one at a time. They also train warriors much faster than the small or medium barracks.\n\nThese buildings store all resources except mana and jewels. There are four types, in order of size and cost to produce they are: provision stores, small stores, medium stores and large stores.\n\nTo construct a building, slaves must be sent into an unfinished building. They will build it automatically, using the resources that realm has stored. If the realm does not have enough of one or more particular resource, they will use whatever there is stored, then wait until new resources are delivered to the realm, which must be done manually.\n\nThe development on \"Theocracy\" began when developer Philos Laboratories hired several new employees who had previous experience developing the game \"\". It was decided that they would develop a new strategy title, with the goal of merging aspects of the games \"Command & Conquer\" and \"Civilization\". The setting was decided by the game's graphic artists, deciding on an Aztec theme. Development continued for two years, with a planned release in spring 1999.\n\nHowever, in March 1999 publisher Interactive Magic had decided to abandon boxed releases for their future titles, putting \"Theocracy\" in jeopardy. Philos eventually managed to buy back the publishing rights, and started updating the game to allow for a future release. These changes included redrawing most of the games graphics, switching the game resolution to 800x600, and the addition of \"chronicles\". The French publisher Ubisoft picked up the publishing rights, and work began on finishing the game for release. The game was finally released for both Windows and Linux on March 30, 2000. There was consideration towards a follow up, focusing on as then undecided new civilization and using features thought up after the original game's development entered feature freeze.\n\n\"Theocracy\" received mixed reviews upon its release. Its strongest praise came from Eurogamer, with one reviewer stating that the game's \"mix of real time and turn based strategy means that \"Theocracy\" takes place on a far larger canvas than a purely real time game ever could.\" The reviewer praised its wide scope and original ideas, separating it from many of its contemporaries. The British publication PC Zone was also impressed with the games originality, describing it as being \"as refreshing as a pint of lager after a chicken vindaloo, and definitely worth shouting about.\" Other members of the press were less impressed, causing the game to only score a 72 on MobyGames. Reviewers criticized the game as being simple and archaic, while at the same time others thought that the interface was cumbersome and the learning curve was too steep.\n\nEven though it was mostly unknown outside of Europe, the game managed to sell well enough, especially on Linux where it became a best-seller. One reviewer of the game's Linux port stated that \"the game is a world apart from a lot of the linux games I've been playing lately. It's solid and feels nice to use - the buttons click with a satisfying sound played at the right moment, and it feels... professional.\" The port was also plagued with negative comments however, with many complaining about installation problems and about various technical faults (such as only being able to play the game in 16 bit colours and the lack of a proper full-screen mode). Even with these problems, it still holds an average of four out of five stars at The Linux Game Tome. A review in German print magazine LinuxUser was mostly positive.\n\n\n"}
