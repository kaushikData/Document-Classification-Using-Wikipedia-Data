{"id": "49268463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49268463", "title": "Atlas the Barbary lion versus the Bengal tiger of Simla", "text": "Atlas the Barbary lion versus the Bengal tiger of Simla\n\nAccording to the \"Gettysburg Compiler\" and \"The Baltimore Sun\", in India, towards the end of the 19th century, the Gaekwad of Baroda, that is Sayajirao III, arranged a fight between a Barbary lion called \"Atlas\", from the Atlas Mountains between Algeria and Morocco, and a man-eating Bengal tiger from the Indian region of Shimla, before an audience of thousands. It was to determine whether the lion or the tiger should be called the \"King of the Cat Family\", or if the lion deserved the title of \"King of the Beasts\".\n\nThe fight took place in an amphitheatre. It had heavy logs, was open to the sky, and its arena was circular, with a diameter of about . Within the arena was a belt about wide, lined by sheet iron to prevent the animals from escaping. The arena had seats or boxes for spectators. The Gaekwad was on a Royal box with other dignitaries.\n\nThe beasts were shifted from their pens into wooden cages, which were then taken to the arena. After Rajput attendants left the ring, the Gaekwad pulled the ropes, which were attached to the doors of the cages. First the tiger emerged from its cage, then Atlas.\n\nThe tiger was more than long, over at the shoulder, had long teeth and claws, besides strong shoulders, and was agile. People considered it to be the biggest man-eater that they ever saw in India. They chose an African lion to fight it, rather than an Asiatic lion in India, because the latter was considered to be too 'small' or 'timorous' to cope with the tiger. In reality, it appears from reports of clashes between Indian lions and tigers, besides that they co-existed before the end of the 19th century, that Asiatic lions could compete with tigers. For example, a draw was reported by \"St. Landry Democrat\" (1887), \"The Eaton Democrat\" (1887), \"The Iola Register\" (1887), \"The Milan Exchange\" (1887), and \"The Sydney Mail\" (1889), from \"The Sun (New York)\", and a victory for the lion was reported by Herne (1855).\n\nAtlas looked taller at the head than the tiger, and had a large mane, legs, and paws. It was described by \"Gettysburg Compiler\" (1899) as being \"much superior to the black-maned lions of South Africa (themselves described as being among the largest lions) in bulk and bravery\", that it, or its subspecies, was \"the largest or most formidable of all African felidae\", and therefore, that it was bigger than the Asiatic lion. However, it is not unanimously held that the Barbary and Cape lions were the largest lions (See \"Physical comparison of tigers and lions\"). Nevertheless, an English Colonel called 'Maitland', who supported the tiger, described the lion as a 'monster'. \n\nBoth were hungry, as their diets had been reduced from their regular intake of food, beforehand. \"Gettysburg Compiler\" (1899) said \"If the tiger was the personification of graceful strength and supple energy, the lion was the embodiment of massive power and adamantine muscle.\"\n\nThe tiger crawled forward, crouched flat and calculated the distance for a spring at Atlas. Atlas' tail lashed at its sides, as it gave a deep roar and waited for the tiger to attack. The tiger sprang at Atlas, which then rose up on its hind legs, and crashed with the tiger. The two yelled, snarled and rolled over on the ground. They regained their feet and shook to be free. When they parted from the clinch, Atlas swung his right, clawed, paw on the tiger's head, ripping its ear, and scratching off skin. The tiger rolled off. Atlas went to get it, and swiped its paw, but the tiger managed to twist away from Atlas' paw-swipe, and escaped. Then Atlas advanced, but the tiger retreated.\n\nThe tiger jumped into the air, landing on Atlas' back, though Atlas was about away. At first, Atlas looked disgusted, but then it forced the tiger to the wall of the arena. However, the tiger did not decide to escape again, rather, it ran, with its head nearly at the ground, towards Atlas' legs. Despite a crash, the tiger's head did not shake, and the two cats rose on their hind legs. For at least three minutes, they exchanged right and left paw-swipes. The tiger's paw-swipes were faster than those of Atlas, outnumbering Atlas' paw-swipes three-to-one. Atlas' paw-swipes had been heavier, inflicting deeper gashes on the tiger's hide, than those of the tiger to Atlas' hide.\n\nBoth cats injured, they retreated from each other. Blood flew from their flanks. The tiger retreated to the wall, to hug it, whereas Atlas stood his ground, even though blood was dripping from about twenty wounds, and roared ferociously.\n\nAfter resting for a few moments, the tiger tried to circle Atlas, with Atlas looking worried, as his rushes did not stop the tiger at first. Then, sensing an opportunity, Atlas charged, but the tiger avoided the charge, and jumped onto Atlas’ back again. Their bodies, bloodied and dirtied by the dust, rolled halfway across the arena. Atlas shook himself off the tiger, and delivered right swipes. One of the swipes dealt a blow to the tiger, causing it to stagger and retreat.\n\nAfter retreating, the tiger sat, studying how effective the previous tussle was. Atlas was mauled, but not yet killed, with two long rips on his back, having deep bites to the shoulder, which bled, and he panted hoarsely, with the wind flowing less evidently than that of the tiger.\n\nAfter observing Atlas for a moment, the tiger tried circling Atlas again. Atlas rushed, facing the tiger's claws. After the tussle, the lion, running out of breath, sank to his knees. The tiger, though it looked stronger, had its stripes disappear under fast-flowing blood.\n\nThe tiger sprang onto Atlas, who now staggered. It bit Atlas' nose, then tried to bite Atlas' throat. However, the mane saved Atlas' neck, so the tiger's bite did not suffocate Atlas. Instead, as they wrestled much, the tiger managed to get hair in its mouth, and the hair interfered with the tiger's respiration, so it had to release its hold on Atlas, allowing Atlas to deliver a massive left uppercut. The uppercut caused the tiger to stumble to about away.\n\nThe tiger circled Atlas like a snake. Although Atlas looked formidable and brave, he could not follow the tiger's motions. Then the tiger charged at Atlas. Atlas used his claws, but he missed the tiger, and went over with it. The tiger frantically pawed Atlas' body, using both fore and hind paws, for forty seconds. However, Atlas managed to throw the tiger off, but then Atlas tried to roar, before falling down and dying.\n\nThe Gaekwad agreed to pay 37,000 rupees, ordered that Atlas' body be buried in Royal fashion, and that the tiger was to be given a \"cage of honour\" in the menagerie of Baroda. He accepted that the tiger was the \"King of the Cat Family\", while speaking to Colonel Maitland, and thought of a match between the tiger and another animal. Colonel Maitland then said that the tiger was not the \"King of Carnivorae\", to which the Gaekwad asked \"Indeed?\" The Colonel replied by saying that he hunted in the Rocky Mountains, and that a grizzly bear could 'whip' the tiger. Therefore, the Gaekwad decided to prepare the tiger for a battle with a Sierran grizzly bear weighing over . The preparation involved the tiger recovering from its injuries.\n\n"}

Most of these laws and regulations have been found to be unconstitutional when challenged. In the US, free speech is considered a fundamental right of every individual, guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth constitutional amendments, and in the majority of legal cases it has been concluded that practicing artistic free speech is legal. Busking is legally considered to be artistic free speech and clearly not panhandling or begging.\n\nIn the United States, reasons to regulate or ban busking behavior include public safety issues and noise issues in certain areas such as hospital zones and residential zones. In residential zones, a reasonable curfew may be allowed. Such laws must be narrowly tailored to eliminate only the perceived evils by limiting the time, place, and manner that busking may be practiced. They must also leave open reasonable alternative venues. The only exceptions to these free speech rules are sedition, as defined by the Smith Act, public displays of pornography and obscenity as defined by the Miller test for obscenity, criminal behavior such as fraud or defamation, certain commercial advertising and the common laws talked about above. In the US, laws regulating or banning busking must be applied evenly to all forms of free speech according to the first and fourteenth constitutional amendments and the judicial decisions listed below.\n\nBusking cannot be prohibited in an area where other forms of free speech are not prohibited. For example, if busking is regulated or banned but people are allowed to conduct free speech behavior for pickets, protests, religious, political, educational, sports, commercial or other purposes, then the law is illegal. In the United States any form of regulation on artistic free speech must not be judgmental, and permits must not be so restrictive, complex, difficult or expensive to obtain that they inhibit free speech. It is also unlawful per federal court decision for law officers to seize a performer's instruments.\n\nUnder Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241 Conspiracy Against Rights, it is unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person of any state, territory or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him/her by the Constitution or the laws of the United States, or because of his/her having exercised the same.\n\nUnder United States law, it is the express duty of all officers of the law or individuals such as security guards, legislators, mayors, Council Persons, judges, Hospitals and Nursing Home Proprietors, etc., to protect and preserve an individual's constitutional rights Under \"Title 18, U.S.C., Section 242 - Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law\". Most of these individuals take oaths to uphold the US Constitution. It is clearly a violation of federal law for these individuals to violate people's constitutional or civil rights under the color of the law.\n"}

The film stars Orelsan and fellow French rapper Gringe, both of whom form the rap duo Casseurs Flowters, and is based on their debut studio album \"Orelsan et Gringe sont les Casseurs Flowters\", which was released on 15 November 2013.\n\nThe film is set over a 24-hour period in the city of Caen, Normandy, and follows Aurélien, known as Orel (Orelsan, as he was formerly known), and Guillaume, known as Gringe (himself). They seek to finish recording their first song together at the request of their producers Skread (himself) and Ablaye (himself), but struggle to do so as they wander around the town with friends looking for quick ways to make money and a good time.\n\n\"Comment c'est loin\" was premiered at the Saint-Jean-de-Luz International Film Festival on October 10, 2015, as well as being shown at the Sarlat Film Festival on November 13, 2015, before being released to the French public on December 9, 2015. The film has received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, and grossed $1,001,196 in the domestic box office within its first three weeks.\n\nAfter half a decade of doing next to nothing, Orelsan and Gringe are in their mid-thirties as they struggle to complete their first rap album. Their songs are mostly stories of sex and alcohol, reflecting their everyday lives in the city of Caen. They have never really finished a song and when they meet with their producers, they are faced with a new challenge. Their old issues, the fear of failure, their alcoholic friends and annoying girlfriends serve to stand in their way as they set out to finish their first song within the next 24 hours.\n\n\n\"Comment c'est loin\" was filmed on location in the city of Caen, Lower Normandy, where Orelsan went to college and met record producer Skread, one of the film's other composers.

{"id": "16394240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16394240", "title": "Criticism of ESPN", "text": "Criticism of ESPN\n\nThroughout its history, ESPN and its sister networks have been the targets of criticism for programming choices, biased coverage, conflict of interest, and controversies with individual broadcasters and analysts. Additionally, ESPN has been criticized for focusing too much on men's college and professional sports, and very little on women's sports. Other criticism has focused on issues of race and ethnicity in ESPN's varying mediated forms, as well as carriage fees and issues regarding the exportation of ESPN content. Some critics argue that ESPN's success is their ability to provide other enterprise and investigative sports news while competing with other hard sports-news-producing outlets such as Yahoo! Sports and Fox Sports. Some scholars have challenged ESPN's journalistic integrity calling for an expanded standard of professionalism to prevent biased coverage and conflicts of interest. Mike Freeman's 2001 book \"ESPN: The Uncensored History\", which alleged sexual harassment, drug use and gambling, was the first critical study of ESPN.\n\nESPN currently charges the highest retransmission consent fee of any major cable television network in the United States. In 2011, the main channel alone carried a monthly rate of $4.69 per subscriber (nearly five times the price of the next-costliest channel, TNT), with ESPN's other English language channels costing an additional $1.13 per subscriber; these prices rise on a nearly constant basis. By 2017, ESPN's fees had risen to over $7 for the main channel and roughly $3 for its sister outlets. Part of the cause of this high fee is the amount of money that ESPN pays for sports rights, particularly the NFL. In August 2011, ESPN agreed to pay the NFL $1.9 billion annually for the rights to carry \"Monday Night Football\" through 2021; this despite the fact that the broadcast networks pay approximately half that price for their packages, which include lucrative and highly watched contests such as the Super Bowl, conference championships and Thanksgiving games while ESPN's package does not (ESPN's package does include the NFL Draft). Cable and satellite television providers condemned ESPN's most recent contract extension with the NFL and have contemplated moving the network to a higher programming tier to mitigate cost increases.\n\nIn 2012, ESPN reportedly paid about $7.3 billion over 12 years for the broadcasting rights to all seven bowl games of the College Football Playoff, an average of about $608 million per year. That includes $215 million per year which they previously agreed to air the Rose, Sugar and Orange bowls, plus $470–475 million annually for the rest of the package. Also in 2012, ESPN and Major League Baseball agreed to an eight-year extension, increasing ESPN's average yearly payment from about $360 million to approximately $700 million. And in October 2014, ESPN signed a nine-year extension with the NBA, worth three times as much as the previous deal.\n\nThese deals were made when new sports channels like NBCSN and Fox Sports 1 emerged, and so analysts believe that ESPN deliberately drove the prices up as a defensive measure to block these competitors from acquiring live rights. Wall Street analysts have also raised concerns that the amount ESPN is paying for all of these rights could be a major drain on The Walt Disney Company as a whole, since the amount of money that can be recuperated from retransmission consent fees and advertising is limited; Disney still profits from the ESPN division but as of 2015 was cutting the network's higher-priced content to ensure long-term profitability. In October 2015, ESPN laid off about 300 employees, citing the rights costs combined with the increasing trend of cord-cutting. Another 100 employees, mostly in news gathering and including large numbers of public faces of the network, were laid off in April 2017.\n\nJohn Skipper's time as President of ESPN was tumultuous. During Skipper's tenure (from January 2012 to December 2017) ESPN lost nearly 15% of its subscribers and laid off more than 500 employees. Additionally, ESPN's TV ratings declined significantly across the board and the network endured criticism from some quarters over the declining quality of its programming.\n\nESPN has been accused of having a bias towards certain sports teams and a \"love affair\" with superstar players. ESPN's ombudsman, Le Anne Schreiber, responded to these criticisms by saying that the industry is ratings-driven.\nSince MLB Network launched on January 1, 2009, \"Baseball Tonight\" has been the target of criticism because of its perceived bias in favor of certain teams such as the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees, in particular. One opinion was expressed by former major-leaguer Heath Bell:\nDespite achievements by female athletes, ESPN underrepresents them in its coverage. A longitudinal analysis found that women's sports received less than 2% of the coverage on SportsCenter. When they are covered, critics argue that female athletes have been featured through the lens of femininity, characterized by a display of sociability and passivity.\n\nOn August 4, 2009, Dish Network sued ESPN for $1 million in a federal breach of contract lawsuit, alleging that the network violated the \"Most Favored Nations\" clause by not extending the same carriage terms that it provided to Comcast and DirecTV for ESPNU and ESPN Classic. On August 5, ESPN announced it would fight the lawsuit and stated in a press release that \"we have repeatedly advised Dish that we are in full compliance with our agreement and have offered them a distribution opportunity with respect to ESPNU and ESPN Classic consistent with the rest of the industry. We will not renegotiate settled contracts and will vigorously defend this legal action, the apparent sole purpose of which is to get a better deal.\"\n\nDish Network moved ESPNU from its \"America's Top 250\" package to its \"America's Top 120\" package on September 30, 2009. However, the provider claimed that the change had nothing to do with the lawsuit. On June 22, 2010, ESPN majority owner The Walt Disney Company pulled the high definition feeds of ESPNews, Disney Channel, Disney XD and ABC Family from Dish Network's lineup, although the standard definition feeds of all four channels remained on the provider. In March 2014, Disney signed a comprehensive carriage deal with Dish Network for its networks (along with several new networks, such as Disney Junior, Longhorn Network, and SEC Network), including high definition feeds and TV Everywhere access for the networks and ABC owned-and-operated stations, and the ability to distribute their networks on a planned over-the-top internet television service. As a condition of the new deal, Dish Network agreed to disable the ability to use the automatic commercial skipping function on its Hopper DVR on ABC programming within 72 hours of its original airing. In December 2014, Dish Network reached a similar new carriage deal with CBS, restricting the use of AutoHop on CBS programming for seven days after its original airing.\n\nIn April 2015, ESPN Inc. sued Verizon for offering ESPN and ESPN2 as part of an optional sports theme package under its new \"Custom TV\" offering for its FiOS service, breaching a requirement for the two networks to be carried as part of the basic service.\n\nIn August 2006, ESPN announced that ABC Sports would be fully integrated into ESPN, using the channel's graphics and music for its sports presentations, in addition to handling production responsibilities for the ABC sports telecasts. The last live sporting event televised under the ABC Sports banner was the U.S. Championship Game of the Little League World Series on August 26, 2006 (ABC was slated to carry the Little League World Series Championship Game on August 27, but the game was postponed to August 28 due to rain, and subsequently aired on ESPN2). The changeover took effect the following weekend to coincide with the start of the college football season, with NBA, IndyCar Series and NASCAR coverage eventually following suit.\n\nDespite the rebranding, George Bodenheimer's official title remained \"President, ESPN Inc. and ABC Sports\" until his retirement at the end of 2011, upon which the \"ABC Sports\" portion of the title was retired. In addition, ABC itself maintains the copyright over many of the ESPN-branded broadcasts, if they are not contractually assigned to the applicable league or organizer. ABC-affiliated stations owned by Hearst Television (such as WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh; WCVB-TV in Boston; WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire; WISN-TV in Milwaukee and KMBC-TV in Kansas City) have the right of first refusal over the local simulcasts of ESPN-televised \"Monday Night Football\" games involving teams within their home market, which are very rarely waived to other local stations in their market areas. Equally, other Hearst-owned stations affiliated with other networks (such as NBC affiliate WBAL-TV in Baltimore) have been able to air NFL games from ESPN for the same reason.\n\nESPN has been criticized for decreasing the number of sports broadcasts on ABC, especially during the summer months. One such example is NASCAR: from 2007 to 2009, ABC aired all of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup races, along with the penultimate race to the chase. From 2010 to 2014, ABC only broadcast three Sprint Cup races with only one Chase race (held in Charlotte, North Carolina) to the outrage of many NASCAR fans and sponsors. Several other events such as the Rose Bowl, the Citrus Bowl and The Open Championship, have also been moved from ABC to ESPN. This, however, is not entirely the fault of ESPN, as ABC in general has attracted a primarily female viewership in recent years, with sports largely attracting a male-dominated audience.\n\nUnder NFL broadcasting rules, game telecasts aired on cable must be simulcast on broadcast television in the local markets of the teams playing, though the game cannot be televised in the market of the home team if it does not sell out tickets 72 hours before the time of kickoff – games that are not sold out must be blacked out in the market of origin. Similar rules and rights were previously in place for ESPN-televised Major League Baseball playoff games.\n\nDave O'Brien joined Marcelo Balboa on the primary broadcast team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup coverage on ESPN and ABC Sports, despite having no experience calling soccer matches prior to that year. Because The Walt Disney Company, owner of both television outlets, retained control over on-air talent, the appointment of O'Brien as the main play-by-play voice was made over the objections of Soccer United Marketing, which wanted JP Dellacamera to continue in that role. Disney stated that its broadcast strategy was intended, in voice and style, to target the vast majority of Americans who do not follow the sport on a regular basis. Mispronunciation and incorrect addressing of names, misuse of soccer terminology, and lack of insight into tactics and history plagued the telecasts, resulting in heavy criticism from English-speaking soccer fans, many of whom ended up watching the games on Univision instead.\n\nSome Arena Football League fans complained that ESPN's 2007 and 2008 game broadcast schedule \"inequitably favors teams\" such as the Philadelphia Soul, Chicago Rush and Colorado Crush, teams whose ownerships respectively include Jon Bon Jovi, Mike Ditka and John Elway. Fourteen of the seventeen ESPN games featured at least one of the three teams playing in the broadcasts. The Soul (whose part-owner and team president is former \"Arena Football League on ESPN\" analyst Ron Jaworski) appeared in seven of the 17 regular season games aired on ESPN platforms, more than any other team in the league. This criticism was also present when NBC opted to not let certain teams appear on their schedule. In 2008, the Chicago Rush had nine regular season games on ESPN and ABC, while the 2007 Arena Bowl Champion San Jose SaberCats appeared in just one – a Week 1 game against the Rush; and the New York Dragons appeared in one broadcast, a 10:30 pm game versus the Crush. Other criticism includes the scheduling of games on various days and times, as opposed to a weekly AFL gameday.\n\nIn 2006, former San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds starred in \"Bonds on Bonds\", a 10-part reality series that aired on ESPN. At the time, Bonds was mired in allegations of steroid use during his Major League Baseball career. ESPN was criticized for allowing Bonds such a one-sided public pulpit, as it was the most powerful name in American sports journalism; the show was seen by some as ESPN giving up any semblance of journalism in favor of becoming a public relations front for major sports teams and players. ESPN responded to the criticism by claiming that Bonds would not have creative control and that the episodes would be fair, balanced, and only document the day-to-day activities of Bonds as they occurred, not as Bonds wanted them to occur. ESPN and producer Tollin/Robbins Productions officially pulled the plug on the reality series, citing \"creative control\" issues with star Barry Bonds and his representatives. No other details about the decision were given. \"Bonds on Bonds\" had been absent from the network's schedule since May 30, 2006 and had been generating poor ratings.\n\nThe 2007 Subway 500 from Martinsville Speedway was not shown on ABC owned-and-operated station KABC-TV in Los Angeles (owned by ESPN co-parent The Walt Disney Company) on October 21 due to coverage of a series of wildfires that affected Southern California, specifically the Buckweed fire in Santa Clarita and the Canyon Fire in Malibu. The race was instead shown on its second digital subchannel (branded as \"ABC7+\"), which was not available on satellite providers or on select cable providers in the area.\n\nSeveral stations chose to pre-empt \"NASCAR Countdown\" to carry their local newscasts. KABC-TV pre-empted the pre-race program before every Saturday night race, and as well as before the 2007 Ford 400, which was held on a Sunday afternoon, to air an episode of the Disney Channel series \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\" from the network's ABC Kids block to fulfill E/I programming requirements enforced by the Federal Communications Commission. ABC affiliates WPLG in Miami, Florida and KSAT-TV in San Antonio, Texas also pre-empted \"NASCAR Countdown\" at least once during the 2007 NASCAR season.\n\nKTKA-TV in Topeka, Kansas, located about from Emporia, the hometown of NASCAR Cup driver (and 2007 Chase participant) Clint Bowyer and about 55 miles from the Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, broke away from ABC's coverage of the 2007 Bank of America 500 early on October 13 to air its nightly 10:00 pm newscast and did not resume its broadcast of the race. KSAT also aired a brief news update, which came during a red flag, but returned in time for the checkered flag.\n\nThe 2008 Sharpie MINI 300 was not seen on several ABC stations for various reasons, ranging from weather bulletins (such as those aired on WSB-TV in Atlanta and WSOC-TV in Charlotte) to stations airing coverage of the Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament at the time of the race (such as with KLKN in Lincoln, Nebraska; where the race moved to an ESPN2 alternate feed, which is normally used when syndication exclusivity rules force an ESPN blackout). In addition, ABC's New York City flagship station WABC-TV carried the race, but pre-empted \"NASCAR Countdown\" and the rain delay to cover a construction accident at a high-rise building in Manhattan.\n\nAfter a red flag during lap 284, the 2008 Checker O'Reilly Auto Parts 500 Presented by Pennzoil, viewers in the Eastern and Central Time Zones were forced to watch the finish of the race on Lap 284 on ESPN2 as ABC ended its broadcast of the race to air \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" at 7:30 pm Eastern Time, while the network continued the race to its conclusion (ending at 313 laps) in the Mountain and Pacific Time Zones.\n\nSome complaints regarding ESPN have concerned the promotion, or perceived lack thereof, of NBA telecasts. The 2003 NBA Finals received very little significant promotion on ABC or corporate partner ESPN; while subsequent Finals were promoted more often on both networks, NBA-related advertisements on ABC were still significantly fewer compared to promotions on NBC. NBA promos took up 3 minutes and 55 seconds of airtime on ABC during the week of May 23, 2004, according to the \"Sports Business Daily\", comparable to 2 minutes and 45 seconds for the Indianapolis 500. Promotions for the Indianapolis 500 outnumbered promotions for the NBA Finals fourteen-to-nine from the timeframe between 9:00 and 11:00 pm Eastern Time during that week.\n\nESPN's studio team was generally more criticized than praised. After the Pacers–Pistons brawl in November 2004, ESPN's studio team came under severe criticism, both by the media and by the network itself for their stance regarding the actions of Indiana Pacers player Ron Artest (who entered the stands to confront a fan, sparking the melee). John Saunders came down hard on Detroit fans, referring to them as \"punks\", while Greg Anthony and Tim Legler defended Artest. The day after the brawl, Steve Levy led into a report on the brawl on \"SportsCenter\" by saying, \"before you unconditionally blame the players, take a look and a listen.\" He concluded the report on the brawl by calling it \"on an overall sorry night for the NBA, and especially fans of the Detroit Pistons,\" without any reference to the Pacers.\n\nDuring the 2006 WNBA Finals, Detroit Shock head coach, and former ESPN NBA analyst, Bill Laimbeer became irritated by ESPN's coverage. He was quoted by the \"Detroit Free Press\" as saying:\nOn July 8, 2010, basketball player LeBron James announced on a live, one-hour ESPN special titled \"The Decision\" that he would leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and join the Miami Heat, beginning with the 2010–11 season. In exchange for the exclusive rights to air the special, ESPN agreed to hand over its advertising and airtime to James. James arranged for the special to include an interview conducted by Jim Gray, who was paid by James' marketing company and had no affiliation with the network. ESPN's reporting leading up to the James special, its decision to air the program, and its decision to relinquish editorial independence were widely cited as gross violations of journalistic ethics.\n\nESPN is often accused of having a bias towards certain college basketball teams, including those in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), particularly the Duke Blue Devils and North Carolina Tar Heels as well as the Kentucky Wildcats of the Southeastern Conference. ESPN maintains a broadcast rights agreement with the ACC that runs through the 2026–2027 season, which provides additional football, men's and women's basketball and Olympic sports coverage on a variety of platforms, suggesting that the bias may have a financial motivation.\n\nDick Vitale is often criticized for being a \"homer\" for Duke, especially for Coach Mike Krzyzewski, as well as most teams within the ACC. He is also known for mentioning Duke frequently during broadcasts, even when the Blue Devils are not playing. Former Temple University head coach John Chaney once said \"You can't get Dick Vitale to say 15 words without Duke coming out of his mouth\".\n\nOn July 18, 2009, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was accused of sexual assault in a civil lawsuit filed by Andrea McNulty. ESPN came under fire for being the only major media outlet that refused to report on the story. ESPN officials attempted to justify their actions by stating that the case is a private matter. Furthermore, ESPN claimed that since Roethlisberger had not addressed the issue publicly, and since no criminal charges had been filed, there was no reason to report on it. However, many have been quick to point out other instances where ESPN has reported on civil cases as well as statements addressing the matter by Roethlisberger's attorney. The network's actions resulted in some media sources accusing them of double standards and poor journalistic practices. ESPN began reporting on the story on July 23, 2009; one month later on August 18, ESPN released a column on its website explaining the network's decision.\n\nIn 2015, ESPN received criticism from Deadspin for accepting advertising from DraftKings, a daily fantasy sports site, and integrating DraftKings into the network's football coverage through product placement, breaching the ethical wall between journalism and sponsorship.\n\nIn 2011, ESPN agreed to a deal with the NFL worth more than $15 billion. This fact led several media organizations, including \"Forbes\", to argue whether the financial relationship with the league creates a conflict of interest when ESPN covers the NFL. The network has also been accused of alleged pro-NFL bias on labor issues with the league and the union and ignoring or downplaying crimes or scandals committed by owners.\n\nAlso, \"The New York Times\" reported that ESPN spiked its partnership with the PBS series \"Frontline\" on the 2013 documentary \"League of Denial,\" which chronicles the history of head injuries in the NFL, shortly after a meeting between ESPN executives and league commissioner Roger Goodell took place in New York City, though ESPN denies pressure from the NFL led to its backing out of the project, claiming a lack of editorial control instead.\n\nBoston based journalist Michael Corcoran stated that in the first 7 months after the Deflategate scandal became national news, ESPN.com used the term \"Deflategate\" in 844 separate articles or videos, including the Chris Mortensen's erroneous report about 11 of the 12 footballs used in the were 2 pounds per square inch (PSI) under NFL regulation. This was compared to when Jimmy Haslam, owner of the Cleveland Browns, was accused by the FBI in a 120-page affidavit of a five-year-long \"conspiracy to scheme\" and \"defraud its customers\" out of millions in rebates for his company Pilot Flying J. In the first 7 months after the FBI raided Haslam's company, ESPN only mentioned the scandal 23 times, less than 3 percent of the coverage of the allegations of football deflation. \"ESPN should, at a minimum, disclose the details of its enormous vested interest before reporting any serious story about the league,\" Corcoran's article concluded.\n\nNonetheless, in July 2015, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that sources within ESPN believed that the NFL gave them a \"terrible\" 2015 \"Monday Night Football\" schedule as \"payback\" for remarks made on air by both ESPN commentators Keith Olbermann and Bill Simmons that were critical of the league and Goodell; ESPN parted ways with both Olbermann and Simmons during that same year.\n\nDespite the growth in popularity of mixed martial arts and its largest promotion – the Ultimate Fighting Championship – in particular, many fans of the sport feel that ESPN still treats MMA fighting as a fringe sport by either not showing highlights of recent drawing matchups or by portraying the sport in a negative light. Commentators such as Mike Wilbon and Tony Kornheiser of \"Pardon the Interruption\", along with Skip Bayless of \"First Take\" have openly criticized the sport as inferior to boxing. Jim Rome of the former ESPN program \"Jim Rome is Burning\" however, often defends the sport and featured fighters as guests.\n\nSome MMA fans feel that the influence of ESPN's corporate parent The Walt Disney Company (both due to not having broadcast rights and due to Disney's traditionally family friendly image), along with the influence of the boxing media have contributed to what they perceive as negative coverage of the sport on the channel. Other complaints include the ESPN show \"MMA Live\" being aired in a late Friday night (1:00 am Eastern Time) timeslot that many MMA fans feel is inadequate, and is often prone to preemptions due to live programming. After the UFC signed a television rights deal with rival Fox Sports, UFC president Dana White lashed out at ESPN following the cancellation of an appearance for an interview promoting the UFC 134 event.\n\nIn its early days, ESPN aired various professional wrestling programs, including \"AWA Championship Wrestling\" from the American Wrestling Association as well as World Class Championship Wrestling. ESPN started distancing itself from professional wrestling after the more athletic-oriented AWA went out of business in 1991, two years after World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon admitted that professional wrestling was staged and was more about entertainment than about legitimate athletic competition. ESPN wouldn't distance itself completely from professional wrestling, as the network commissioned the Global Wrestling Federation for three years following AWA's failure, and Canadian sister network TSN held the Canadian rights to \"WWE Raw\" from 1996 to 2006, as well as the parent network having aired This is SportsCenter ads featuring The Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and John Cena on occasion.\n\nOn March 24, 2015, former UFC Heavyweight Champion and then-current WWE World Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar appeared on \"SportsCenter\" for a \"huge announcement\" after it became public knowledge that Lesnar's WWE contract was set to expire after WrestleMania 31 and that he had been training for a return to MMA. However, Lesnar used the air time to announce that he in fact had re-signed with WWE and was retired from MMA, with part of the interview being done by then-\"SportsCenter\" anchor Jonathan Coachman, himself a then-former WWE announcer. This would be followed up by a segment on \"SportsCenter\" covering Lesnar's match with Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 31 for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, featuring Lesnar, Reigns, and Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman in studio for the segment. (Seth Rollins ultimately won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at the event after he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract mid-match.) Although ESPN wasn't criticized for covering WWE, it did receive criticism for covering WWE like a legitimate sport as opposed to entertainment; unlike other countries, the United States generally views professional wrestling as entertainment due to it being an open secret that professional wrestling is staged. Lesnar would subsequently return to MMA (while under contract with WWE) for a one-off match at \"UFC 200\" while WWE and ESPN would gradually increase their collaboration into a regular segment on \"SportsCenter\" hosted by Coachman, as well as a subsection devoted to professional wrestling on ESPN.com.\n\nThe association between ESPN and WWE has received criticism outside of mainstream media and within the two organizations themselves. Coachman (who himself would leave ESPN in 2017 and eventually return to WWE a few months afterwards) stated he had wanted a connection between ESPN and WWE for years following his departure from WWE in 2008, but had to wait \"until the right person was in charge\" before the two sides started forming a partnership. In 2016, the wife of WWE wrestler Kevin Owens would post on social media their eight-year-old son's reaction following Owens winning the WWE Universal Championship. While the post would receive positive responses from most reporters, Amin Elhassin for ESPN tweeted that it was feel-good moment for their son \"until he finds out its scripted\". Former WWE wrestler Cody Rhodes, who had left WWE on bad terms earlier that year, said that WWE needs to cut ties with ESPN and that having mainstream recognition \"ain't always worth it\" when one of their reporters tries to ruin it for a child.\n\nDespite ESPN and WWE having somewhat scaled back their relationship since (partially due to other mainstream sports media such as Fox Sports, CBS Sports, Yahoo! Sports, and Bleacher Report also reporting on WWE), the two still partner on occasion.\n\nAside from ESPN's main competitors, such as Fox Sports, NBC Sports, CBS Sports, Turner Sports, and Yahoo Sports, independent and regional sports-focused media firms and blogs, including Deadspin (now owned by Univision Communications), The Big Lead, Bleacher Report (now owned by Turner Sports parent Time Warner), and 700 Level (now associated with NBC Sports parent Comcast), have served as alternatives for fans looking for balanced coverage or better local coverage.\n\nAccountability attempts by third parties range from news articles, websites, and blogs either in a response to specific events or the ongoing lack of or over coverage by ESPN. \"Rolling Stone\" writers Jordan Burchette and Michael Weinreb each published articles examining the implications of ESPN's perceived SEC bias during the 2014 college football season. Moreover, independent blogging group Are You Cereal Box's main tactic is to track mentions of ESPN's alleged favorite teams and players via mentions on ESPN.com's front page.\n\nThe book \"Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN\" notes that Apple CEO Steve Jobs reportedly told ESPN President George Bodenheimer in reference to the network's failed attempt at a mobile virtual network operator mobile phone service, Mobile ESPN in 2006, that \"your phone is the dumbest fucking idea I have ever heard\".\n\nConcerns have been raised by some fans, bloggers and journalists that ESPN's financial stake in the Longhorn Network (which launched in August 2011) creates a potential conflict of interest. Some fear that ESPN's involvement in the network will inhibit journalistic integrity as ESPN has a financial interest in the success of the athletic programs at the University of Texas. \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Richard Deitsch wrote: \"The network's existence... creates an impossible situation for ESPN's college football producers and reporters (plenty of whom care about reporting). For every story ESPN does on Texas and its opponents, they'll be skeptics wondering what the motivation was for the story.\" It has also created issues where the various teams of the Iowa State Cyclones, a Big 12 team well outside the prime Longhorn Network footprint, has had to syndicate and create cable networks carried throughout Iowa (in this case, Mediacom carries a network known as \"Cyclones.tv\") to carry Longhorn Network-exclusive content involving the Longhorns as an opponent within Iowa under a secondary agreement with UT and ESPN.\n\nAdditionally, some have questioned the stipulation included in the network's founding agreement that gives Texas the right to dismiss LHN announcers that don't \"reflect the quality and reputation of UT.\" An ESPN spokesperson addressed the situation by stating: \"This is not common in ESPN agreements because this UT network is so unique/new for us ...The provision does not allow for random replacement of commentators or reaction to critical comments... it's more about potential situations where a commentator makes completely inappropriate comments or gets involved in inappropriate actions.\"\n\nThrough the show's success, \"ESPN First Take\" has also experienced substantial controversy and faced increasing criticism. The show was criticized for what is perceived by many as its excessive coverage of the career of Tim Tebow. During his tenure with the New York Jets, in which he did not start in a game, and threw just eight passes the entire season, Tebow was nonetheless often a leading topic.\n\nAs Miami Heat forward LeBron James began a series of playoff appearances with the Cleveland Cavaliers, host Skip Bayless became well known for his belief that James had been overrated by the media and not received enough criticism for his team's playoff failures. Bayless has himself been criticized by fans as well as members of the media for exaggerating James' failures and diminishing his successes. In an exchange with Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, Cuban argued that Bayless had reduced his analysis of the 2011 and 2012 NBA Finals series to subjective assessments of player psyche rather than relying on objective analysis based on the schematic principles used by the teams in each series.\n\nThe show has also received criticism for its treatment of issues of race. During a December 2012 discussion regarding Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III and his commenting that he did not wish to be perceived solely as a black quarterback, frequent guest Rob Parker asked whether Griffin III was a \"brother\" or a \"cornball brother.\" When pressed by host Cari Champion on what he meant, he mentioned that Griffin III had a white fiancé and questioned whether he was a Republican. Parker, though, acknowledged that he did not have any information substantiating that claim. In response, Bayless asked whether Griffin III's braids did anything to assuage his concerns. To many, this exchange was part of a larger trend of the nature of the treatment of issues of race by the show.\n\nIn June 2015, ESPN's announcement of Caitlyn Jenner, formerly Bruce Jenner, as the recipient of that year's Arthur Ashe Courage Award, one of its annual ESPY Awards, led to significant criticism among online commenters and some members of the media, with Bob Costas calling the decision to give Jenner the award a \"crass exploitation play\". Most of the critics of the Jenner award considered Lauren Hill, who played college basketball despite suffering from a brain tumor that would claim her life only a few months later, a more worthy recipient. Others cited Noah Galloway, an Iraq War double amputee who competes in extreme sports and was also a finalist in the spring 2015 season of \"Dancing with the Stars\", as a worthy candidate.\n\nESPN made the decision to remove Robert Lee from the broadcast team calling the University of Virginia home opener against William and Mary College on September 2, 2017 because he shares the same name as Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Robert Lee, who is not related to the confederate general, is of Asian American heritage. The decision was made in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia which protested the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. ESPN was widely criticized for the move.\n\nFormer tennis player and ESPN commentator Doug Adler was fired after making an allegedly racist comment about Venus Williams on-air. In January 2017, during the broadcast of the Australian Open match, Adler commented '\"Venus is all over her. And you'll see Venus move in and put the guerrilla effect on, charging.\" ESPN insisted that Adler used not the word he claimed he said, namely guerrilla, but rather gorilla to describe Williams, who is African-american. Adler apologized for the remark after being told by his superiors to apologize on air, so that he could keep his job, but was fired by ESPN the next day. In February 2017, Adler filed a lawsuit against ESPN for wrongful termination.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5645", "title": "Cult film", "text": "Cult film\n\nA cult film or cult movie, also commonly referred to as a cult classic, is a film that has acquired a cult following. Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate fanbase, an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and audience participation. Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially box office bombs, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, transgressive films shunned by the mainstream. The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art. The term \"cult film\" itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies, though \"cult\" was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that.\n\nCult films trace their origin back to controversial and suppressed films kept alive by dedicated fans. In some cases, reclaimed or rediscovered films have acquired cult followings decades after their original release, occasionally for their camp value. Other cult films have since become well-respected or reassessed as classics; there is debate as to whether these popular and accepted films are still cult films. After failing in the cinema, some cult films have become regular fixtures on cable television or profitable sellers on home video. Others have inspired their own film festivals. Cult films can both appeal to specific subcultures and form their own subcultures. Other media that reference cult films can easily identify which demographics they desire to attract and offer savvy fans an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge.\n\nCult films frequently break cultural taboos, and many feature excessive displays of violence, gore, sexuality, profanity, or combinations thereof. This can lead to controversy, censorship, and outright bans; less transgressive films may attract similar amounts of controversy when critics call them frivolous or incompetent. Films that fail to attract requisite amounts of controversy may face resistance when labeled as cult films. Mainstream films and big budget blockbusters have attracted cult followings similar to more underground and lesser known films; fans of these films often emphasize the films' niche appeal and reject the more popular aspects. Fans who like the films for the wrong reasons, such as perceived elements that represent mainstream appeal and marketing, will often be ostracized or ridiculed. Likewise, fans who stray from accepted subcultural scripts may experience similar rejection.\n\nSince the late 1970s, cult films have become increasingly popular. Films that once would have been limited to obscure cult followings are now capable of breaking into the mainstream, and showings of cult films have proved to be a profitable business venture. Overbroad usage of the term has resulted in controversy, as purists state it has become a meaningless descriptor applied to any film that is the slightest bit weird or unconventional; others accuse Hollywood studios of trying to artificially create cult films or use the term as a marketing tactic. Films are frequently stated to be an \"instant cult classic\" now, occasionally before they are released. Fickle fans on the Internet have latched on to unreleased films only to abandon them later on release. At the same time, other films have acquired massive, quick cult followings, owing to spreading virally through social media. Easy access to cult films via video on demand and peer-to-peer file sharing has led some critics to pronounce the death of cult films.\nA cult film is any film that has a cult following, although the term is not easily defined and can be applied to a wide variety of films. Some definitions exclude films that have been released by major studios or have big budgets, that try specifically to become cult films, or become accepted by mainstream audiences and critics. Cult films are defined by audience reaction as much as by their content. This may take the form of elaborate and ritualized audience participation, film festivals, or cosplay. Over time, the definition has become more vague and inclusive as it drifts away from earlier, stricter views. Increasing use of the term by mainstream publications has resulted in controversy, as cinephiles argue that the term has become meaningless or \"elastic, a catchall for anything slightly maverick or strange\". Academic Mark Shiel has criticized the term itself as being a weak concept, reliant on subjectivity; different groups can interpret films in their own terms. According to feminist scholar Joanne Hollows, this subjectivity causes films with large female cult followings to be perceived as too mainstream and not transgressive enough to qualify as a cult film. Academic Mike Chopra‑Gant says that cult films become decontextualized when studied as a group, and Shiel criticizes this recontextualization as cultural commodification.\n\nIn 2008, \"Cineaste\" asked a range of academics for their definition of a cult film. Several people defined cult films primarily in terms of their opposition to mainstream films and conformism, explicitly requiring a transgressive element, though others disputed the transgressive potential, given the demographic appeal to conventional moviegoers and mainstreaming of cult films. Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock instead called them mainstream films with transgressive elements. Most definitions also required a strong community aspect, such as obsessed fans or ritualistic behavior. Citing misuse of the term, Mikel J. Koven took a self-described hard-line stance that rejected definitions that use any other criteria. Matt Hills instead stressed the need for an open-ended definition rooted in structuration, where the film and the audience reaction are interrelated and neither is prioritized. Ernest Mathijs focused on the accidental nature of cult followings, arguing that cult film fans consider themselves too savvy to be marketed to, while Jonathan Rosenbaum rejected the continued existence of cult films and called the term a marketing buzzword. Mathijs suggests that cult films help to understand ambiguity and incompleteness in life given the difficulty in even defining the term. That cult films can have opposing qualities – such as good and bad, failure and success, innovative and retro – helps to illustrate that art is subjective and never self-evident. This ambiguity leads critics of postmodernism to accuse cult films of being beyond criticism, as the emphasis is now on personal interpretation rather than critical analysis or metanarratives. These inherent dichotomies can lead audiences to be split between ironic and earnest fans.\n\nWriting in \"Defining Cult Movies\", Jancovich et al. quote academic Jeffrey Sconce, who defines cult films in terms of paracinema, marginal films that exist outside critical and cultural acceptance: everything from exploitation to beach party musicals to softcore pornography. However, they reject cult films as having a single unifying feature; instead, they state that cult films are united in their \"subcultural ideology\" and opposition to mainstream tastes, itself a vague and undefinable term. Cult followings themselves can range from adoration to contempt, and they have little in common except for their celebration of nonconformity – even the bad films ridiculed by fans are artistically nonconformist, albeit unintentionally. At the same time, they state that bourgeois, masculine tastes are frequently reinforced, which makes cult films more of an internal conflict within the bourgeoisie, rather than a rebellion against it. This results in an anti-academic bias despite the use of formal methodologies, such as defamiliarization. This contradiction exists in many subcultures, especially those dependent on defining themselves in terms of opposition to the mainstream. This nonconformity is eventually co-opted by the dominant forces, such as Hollywood, and marketed to the mainstream. Academic Xavier Mendik also defines cult films as opposing the mainstream and further proposes that films can become cult by virtue of their genre or content, especially if it is transgressive. Due to their rejection of mainstream appeal, Mendik says cult films can be more creative and political; times of relative political instability produce more interesting films.\n\nCult films have existed since the early days of cinema. Film critic Harry Allan Potamkin traces them back to 1910s France and the reception of Pearl White, William S. Hart, and Charlie Chaplin, which he described as \"a dissent from the popular ritual\". \"Nosferatu\" (1922) was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\". Stoker's widow sued the production company and drove it to bankruptcy. All known copies of the film were destroyed, and \"Nosferatu\" become an early cult film, kept alive by a cult following that circulated illegal bootlegs. Academic Chuck Kleinhans identifies the Marx Brothers as making other early cult films. On their original release, some highly regarded classics from the Golden Age of Hollywood were panned by critics and audiences, relegated to cult status. \"The Night of the Hunter\" (1955) was a cult film for years, quoted often and championed by fans, before it was reassessed as an important and influential classic. During this time, American exploitation films and imported European art films were marketed similarly. Although critics Pauline Kael and Arthur Knight argued against arbitrary divisions into high and low culture, American films settled into rigid genres; European art films continued to push the boundaries of simple definitions, and these exploitative art films and artistic exploitation films would go on to influence American cult films. Much like later cult films, these early exploitation films encouraged audience participation, influenced by live theater and vaudeville.\n\nModern cult films grew from 1960s counterculture and underground films, popular among those who rejected mainstream Hollywood films. These underground film festivals led to the creation of midnight movies, which attracted cult followings. The term \"cult film\" itself was an outgrowth of this movement and was first used in the 1970s, though \"cult\" had been in use for decades in film analysis with both positive and negative connotations. These films were more concerned with cultural significance than the social justice sought by earlier avant-garde films. Midnight movies became more popular and mainstream, peaking with the release of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975), which finally found its audience several years after its release. Eventually, the rise of home video would marginalize midnight movies once again, after which many directors joined the burgeoning independent film scene or went back underground. Home video would give a second life to box office flops, as positive word-of-mouth or excessive replay on cable television led these films to develop an appreciative audience, as well as obsessive replay and study. For example, \"The Beastmaster\" (1982), despite its failure at the box office, became one of the most played movies on American cable television and developed into a cult film. Home video and television broadcasts of cult films were initially greeted with hostility. Joanne Hollows states that they were seen as turning cult films mainstream – in effect, feminizing them by opening them to distracted, passive audiences.\n\nReleases from major studios – such as \"The Big Lebowski\" (1998), which was distributed by Universal Studios – can become cult films when they fail at the box office and develop a cult following through reissues, such as midnight movies, festivals, and home video. Hollywood films, due to their nature, are more likely to attract this kind of attention, which leads to a mainstreaming effect of cult culture. With major studios behind them, even financially unsuccessful films can be re-released multiple times, which plays into a trend to capture audiences through repetitious reissues. The constant use of profanity and drugs in otherwise mainstream, Hollywood films, such as \"The Big Lebowski\", can alienate critics and audiences yet lead to a large cult following among more open-minded demographics not often associated with cult films, such as Wall Street bankers and professional soldiers. Thus, even comparatively mainstream films can satisfy the traditional demands of a cult film, perceived by fans as transgressive, niche, and uncommercial. Discussing his reputation for making cult films, Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap said, \"I didn't set out to make cult films. I wanted to make box-office hits.\" Writing in \"Cult Cinema\", academics Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton state that this acceptance of mainstream culture and commercialism is not out of character, as cult audiences have a more complex relationship to these concepts: they are more opposed to mainstream values and excessive commercialism than they are anything else.\n\nIn a global context, popularity can vary widely by territory, especially with regard to limited releases. \"Mad Max\" (1979) was an international hit – except in America where it became an obscure cult favorite, ignored by critics and available for years only in a dubbed version though it earned over $100M internationally. Foreign cinema can put a different spin on popular genres, such as Japanese horror, which was initially a cult favorite in America. Asian imports to the West are often marketed as exotic cult films and of interchangeable national identity, which academic Chi-Yun Shin criticizes as reductive. Foreign influence can affect fan response, especially on genres tied to a national identity; when they become more global in scope, questions of authenticity may arise. Filmmakers and films ignored in their own country can become the objects of cult adoration in another, producing perplexed reactions in their native country. Cult films can also establish an early viability for more mainstream films both for filmmakers and national cinema. The early cult horror films of Peter Jackson were so strongly associated with his homeland that they affected the international reputation of New Zealand and its cinema. As more artistic films emerged, New Zealand was perceived as a legitimate competitor to Hollywood, which mirrored Jackson's career trajectory. \"Heavenly Creatures\" (1994) acquired its own cult following, became a part of New Zealand's national identity, and paved the way for big-budget, Hollywood-style epics, such as Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.\n\nMathijs states that cult films and fandom frequently involve nontraditional elements of time and time management. Fans will often watch films obsessively, an activity that is viewed by the mainstream as wasting time yet can be seen as resisting the commodification of leisure time. They may also watch films idiosyncratically: sped up, slowed down, frequently paused, or at odd hours. Cult films themselves subvert traditional views of time – time travel, non-linear narratives, and ambiguous establishments of time are all popular. Mathijs also identifies specific cult film viewing habits, such as viewing horror films on Halloween, sentimental melodrama on Christmas, and romantic films on Valentine's Day. These films are often viewed as marathons where fans can gorge themselves on their favorites. Mathijs states that cult films broadcast on Christmas have a nostalgic factor. These films, ritually watched every season, give a sense of community and shared nostalgia to viewers. New films often have trouble making inroads against the institutions of \"It's A Wonderful Life\" (1946) and \"Miracle on 34th Street\" (1947). These films provide mild criticism of consumerism while encouraging family values. Halloween, on the other hand, allows flaunting society's taboos and testing one's fears. Horror films have appropriated the holiday, and many horror films debut on Halloween. Mathijs criticizes the over-cultified, commercialized nature of Halloween and horror films, which feed into each other so much that Halloween has turned into an image or product with no real community. Mathijs states that Halloween horror conventions can provide the missing community aspect.\n\nDespite their oppositional nature, cult films can produce celebrities. Like cult films themselves, authenticity is an important aspect of their popularity. Actors can become typecast as they become strongly associated with such iconic roles. Tim Curry, despite his acknowledged range as an actor, found casting difficult after he achieved fame in \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\". Even when discussing unrelated projects, interviewers frequently bring up the role, which causes him to tire of discussing it. Mary Woronov, known for her transgressive roles in cult films, eventually transitioned to mainstream films. She was expected to recreate the transgressive elements of her cult films within the confines of mainstream cinema. Instead of the complex gender deconstructions of her Andy Warhol films, she became typecast as a lesbian or domineering woman. Sylvia Kristel, after starring in \"Emmanuelle\" (1974), found herself highly associated with the film and the sexual liberation of the 1970s. Caught between the transgressive elements of her cult film and the mainstream appeal of soft-core pornography, she was unable to work in anything but exploitation films and \"Emmanuelle\" sequels. Despite her immense popularity and cult following, she would rate only a footnote in most histories of European cinema if she was even mentioned. Similarly, Chloë Sevigny has struggled with her reputation as a cult independent film star famous for her daring roles in transgressive films. Cult films can also trap directors. Leonard Kastle, who directed \"The Honeymoon Killers\" (1969), never directed another film again. Despite his cult following, which included François Truffaut, he was unable to find financing for any of his other screenplays. Qualities that bring cult films to prominence – such as an uncompromising, unorthodox vision – caused Alejandro Jodorowsky to languish in obscurity for years.\n\nTransgressive films as a distinct artistic movement began in the 1970s. Unconcerned with genre distinctions, they drew inspiration equally from the nonconformity of European art cinema and experimental film, the gritty subject matter of Italian neorealism, and the shocking images of 1960s exploitation. Some used hardcore pornography and horror, occasionally at the same time. In the 1980s, filmmaker Nick Zedd identified this movement as the Cinema of Transgression and later wrote a manifesto. Popular in midnight showings, they were mainly limited to large urban areas, which led academic Joan Hawkins to label them as \"downtown culture\". These films acquired a legendary reputation as they were discussed and debated in alternative weeklies, such as \"The Village Voice\". Home video would finally allow general audiences to see them, which gave many people their first taste of underground film. Ernest Mathijs says that cult films often disrupt viewer expectations, such as giving characters transgressive motivations or focusing attention on elements outside the film. Cult films can also transgress national stereotypes and genre conventions, such as \"Battle Royale\" (2000), which broke many rules of teenage slasher films. The reverse – when films based on cult properties lose their transgressive edge – can result in derision and rejection by fans. Audience participation itself can be transgressive, such as breaking long-standing taboos against talking during films and throwing things at the screen.\n\nAccording to Mathijs, critical reception is important to a film's perception as cult, through topicality and controversy. Topicality, which can be regional (such as objection to government funding of the film) or critical (such as philosophical objections to the themes), enables attention and a contextual response. Cultural topics make the film relevant and can lead to controversy, such as a moral panic, which provides opposition. Cultural values transgressed in the film, such as sexual promiscuity, can be attacked by proxy, through attacks on the film. These concerns can vary from culture to culture, and they need not be at all similar. However, Mathijs says the film must invoke metacommentary for it to be more than simply culturally important. While referencing previous arguments, critics may attack its choice of genre or its very right to exist. Taking stances on these varied issues, critics assure their own relevance while helping to elevate the film to cult status. Perceived racist and reductive remarks by critics can rally fans and raise the profile of cult films, an example of which would be Rex Reed's comments about Korean culture in his review of \"Oldboy\" (2003). Critics can also polarize audiences and lead debates, such as how Joe Bob Briggs and Roger Ebert dueled over \"I Spit On Your Grave\" (1978). Briggs would later contribute a commentary track to the DVD release in which he describes it as a feminist film. Films which do not attract enough controversy may be ridiculed and rejected when suggested as cult films.\n\nAcademic Peter Hutchings, noting the many definitions of a cult film that require transgressive elements, states that cult films are known in part for their excesses. Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways that break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms. Violence, gore, sexual perversity, and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema. Film censorship can make these films obscure and difficult to find, common criteria used to define cult films. Despite this, these films remain well-known and prized among collectors. Fans will occasionally express frustration with dismissive critics and conventional analysis, which they believe marginalizes and misinterprets paracinema. In marketing these films, young men are predominantly targeted. Horror films in particular can draw fans who seek the most extreme films. Audiences can also ironically latch on to offensive themes, such as misogyny, using these films as catharsis for the things that they hate most in life. Exploitative, transgressive elements can be pushed to excessive extremes for both humor and satire. Frank Henenlotter faced censorship and ridicule, but he found acceptance among audiences receptive to themes that Hollywood was reluctant to touch, such as violence, drug addiction, and misogyny. Lloyd Kaufman sees his films' political statements as more populist and authentic than the hypocrisy of mainstream films and celebrities. Despite featuring an abundance of fake blood, vomit, and diarrhea, Kaufman's films have attracted positive attention from critics and academics. Excess can also exist as camp, such as films that highlight the excesses of 1980s fashion and commercialism.\n\nFilms that are influenced by unpopular styles or genres can become cult films. Director Jean Rollin worked within \"cinéma fantastique\", an unpopular genre in modern France. Influenced by American films and early French fantasists, he drifted between art, exploitation, and pornography. His films were reviled by critics, but he retained a cult following drawn by the nudity and eroticism. Similarly, Jess Franco chafed under fascist censorship in Spain but became influential in Spain's horror boom of the 1960s. These transgressive films that straddle the line between art and horror may have overlapping cult followings, each with their own interpretation and reasons for appreciating it. The films that followed Jess Franco were unique in their rejection of mainstream art. Popular among fans of European horror for their subversiveness and obscurity, these later Spanish films allowed political dissidents to criticize the fascist regime within the cloak of exploitation and horror. Unlike most exploitation directors, they were not trying to establish a reputation. They were already established in the art-house world and intentionally chose to work within paracinema as a reaction against the New Spanish Cinema, an artistic revival supported by the fascists. As late as the 1980s, critics still cited Pedro Almodóvar's anti-macho iconoclasm as a rebellion against fascist mores, as he grew from countercultural rebel to mainstream respectability. Transgressive elements that limit a director's appeal in one country can be celebrated or highlighted in another. Takashi Miike has been marketed in the West as a shocking and avant-garde filmmaker despite his many family-friendly comedies, which have not been imported.\n\nThe transgressive nature of cult films can lead to their censorship. During the 1970s and early 1980s, a wave of explicit, graphic exploitation films caused controversy. Called \"video nasties\" within the UK, they ignited calls for censorship and stricter laws on home video releases, which were largely unregulated. Consequently, the British Board of Film Classification banned many popular cult films due to issues of sex, violence, and incitement to crime. Released during the cannibal boom, \"Cannibal Holocaust\" (1980) was banned in dozens of countries and caused the director to be briefly jailed over fears that it was a real snuff film. Although opposed to censorship, director Ruggero Deodato would later agree with cuts made by the BBFC which removed unsimulated animal killings, which limited the film's distribution. Frequently banned films may introduce questions of authenticity as fans question whether they have seen a truly uncensored cut. Cult films have been falsely claimed to have been banned to increase their transgressive reputation and explain their lack of mainstream penetration. Marketing campaigns have also used such claims to raise interest among curious audiences. Home video has allowed cult film fans to import rare or banned films, finally giving them a chance to complete their collection with imports and bootlegs. Cult films previously banned are sometimes released with much fanfare and the fans assumed to be already familiar with the controversy. Personal responsibility is often highlighted, and a strong anti-censorship message may be present. Previously lost scenes cut by studios can be re-added and restore a director's original vision, which draws similar fanfare and acclaim from fans. Imports are sometimes censored to remove elements that would be controversial, such as references to Islamic spirituality in Indonesian cult films.\n\nAcademics have written of how transgressive themes in cult films can be regressive. David Church and Chuck Kleinhans describe an uncritical celebration of transgressive themes in cult films, including misogyny and racism. Church has also criticized gendered descriptions of transgressive content that celebrate masculinity. Joanne Hollows further identifies a gendered component to the celebration of transgressive themes in cult films, where male terms are used to describe films outside the mainstream while female terms are used to describe mainstream, conformist cinema. Jacinda Read's expansion states that cult films, despite their potential for empowerment of the marginalized, are more often used by politically incorrect males. Knowledgeable about feminism and multiculturalism, they seek a refuge from the academic acceptance of these progressive ideals. Their playful and ironic acceptance of regressive lad culture invites, and even dares, condemnation from academics and the uncool. Thus, cult films become a tool to reinforce mainstream values through transgressive content; Rebecca Feasy states that cultural hierarchies can also be reaffirmed through mockery of films perceived to be lacking masculinity. However, the sexploitation films of Doris Wishman took a feminist approach which avoids and subverts the male gaze and traditional goal-oriented methods. Wishman's subject matter, though exploitative and transgressive, was always framed in terms of female empowerment and the feminine spectator. Her use of common cult film motifs – female nudity and ambiguous gender – were repurposed to comment on feminist topics. Similarly, the films of Russ Meyer were a complicated combination of transgressive, mainstream, progressive, and regressive elements. They attracted both acclaim and denouncement from critics and progressives. Transgressive films imported from cultures that are recognizably different yet still relatable can be used to progressively examine issues in another culture.\n\nCult films can be used to help define or create groups as a form of subcultural capital; knowledge of cult films proves that one is \"authentic\" or \"non-mainstream\". They can be used to provoke an outraged response from the mainstream, which further defines the subculture, as only members could possibly tolerate such deviant entertainment. More accessible films have less subcultural capital; among extremists, banned films will have the most. By referencing cult films, media can identify desired demographics, strengthen bonds with specific subcultures, and stand out among those who understand the intertextuality. Popular films from previous eras may be reclaimed by genre fans long after they have been forgotten by the original audiences. This can be done for authenticity, such as horror fans who seek out now-obscure titles from the 1950s instead of the modern, well-known remakes. Authenticity may also drive fans to deny genre categorization to films perceived as too mainstream or accessible. Authenticity in performance and expertise can drive fan acclaim. Authenticity can also drive fans to decry the mainstream in the form of hostile critics and censors. Especially when promoted by enthusiastic and knowledgeable programmers, choice of venue can be an important part of expressing individuality. Besides creating new communities, cult films can link formerly disparate groups, such as fans and critics. As these groups intermix, they can influence each other, though this may be resisted by older fans, unfamiliar with these new references. In extreme cases, cult films can lead to the creation of religions, such as Dudeism. For their avoidance of mainstream culture and audiences, enjoyment of irony, and celebration of obscure subcultures, academic Martin Roberts compares cult film fans to hipsters.\n\nA film can become the object of a cult following within a particular region or culture if it has unusual significance. For example, Norman Wisdom's films, friendly to Marxist interpretation, amassed a cult following in Albania, as they were among the few Western films allowed by the country's Communist rulers. \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) and its star, Judy Garland, hold special significance to American and British gay culture, although it is a widely viewed and historically important film in greater American culture. Similarly, James Dean and his brief film career have become icons of alienated youth. Cult films can have such niche appeal that they are only popular within certain subcultures, such as \"Reefer Madness\" (1936) and \"Hemp for Victory\" (1942) among the stoner subculture. Beach party musicals, popular among American surfers, failed to find an equivalent audience when imported to the United Kingdom. When films target subcultures like this, they may seem unintelligible without the proper cultural capital. Films which appeal to teenagers may offer subcultural identities that are easily recognized and differentiate various subcultural groups. Films which appeal to stereotypical male activities, such as sports, can easily gain strong male cult followings. Sports metaphors are often used in the marketing of cult films to males, such as emphasizing the \"extreme\" nature of the film, which increases the appeal to youth subcultures fond of extreme sports.\nMatt Hills' concept of the \"cult blockbuster\" involves cult followings inside larger, mainstream films. Although these are big budget, mainstream films, they still attract cult followings. The cult fans differentiate themselves from ordinary fans in several ways: longstanding devotion to the film, distinctive interpretations, and fan works. Hills identifies three different cult followings for \"The Lord of the Rings\", each with their own fandom separate from the mainstream. Academic Emma Pett identifies \"Back to the Future\" (1985) as another example of a cult blockbuster. Although the film topped the charts when it was released, it has developed a nostalgic cult following over the years. The hammy acting by Christopher Lloyd and quotable dialogue draw a cult following, as they mimic traditional cult films. Blockbuster science fiction films that include philosophical subtexts, such as \"The Matrix\", allow cult film fans to enjoy them on a higher level than the mainstream. \"Star Wars\", with its large cult following in geek subculture, has been cited as both a cult blockbuster and a cult film. Although a mainstream epic, \"Star Wars\" has provided its fans with a spirituality and culture outside of the mainstream. Fans, in response to the popularity of these blockbusters, will claim elements for themselves while rejecting others. For example, in the \"Star Wars\" film series, mainstream criticism of Jar Jar Binks focused on racial stereotyping; although cult film fans will use that to bolster their arguments, he is rejected because he represents mainstream appeal and marketing. Also, instead of valuing textual rarity, fans of cult blockbusters will value repeat viewings. They may also engage in behaviors more traditional for fans of cult television and other serial media, as cult blockbusters are often franchised, preconceived as a film series, or both. To reduce mainstream accessibility, a film series can be self-reflexive and full of in-jokes that only longtime fans can understand.\n\nCult films can create their own subculture. \"Rocky Horror\", originally made to exploit the popularity of glam subculture, became what academic Gina Marchetti called a \"sub-subculture\", a variant that outlived its parent subculture. Although often described as primarily composed of obsessed fans, cult film fandom can include many newer, less experienced members. Familiar with the film's reputation and having watched clips on YouTube, these fans may take the next step and enter the film's fandom. If they are the majority, they may alter or ignore long-standing traditions, such as audience participation rituals; rituals which lack perceived authenticity may be criticized, but accepted rituals bring subcultural capital to veteran fans who introduce them to the newer members. Fans who flaunt their knowledge receive negative reactions. Newer fans may cite the film itself as their reason for attending a showing, but longtime fans often cite the community. Organized fandoms may spread and become popular as a way of introducing new people to the film, as well as theatrical screenings being privileged by the media and fandom itself. Fandom can also be used as a process of legitimation. Fans of cult films, as in media fandom, are frequently producers instead of mere consumers. Unconcerned with traditional views on intellectual property, these fan works are often unsanctioned, transformative, and ignore fictional canon.\n\nLike cult films themselves, magazines and websites dedicated to cult films revel in their self-conscious offensiveness. They maintain a sense of exclusivity by offending mainstream audiences with misogyny, gore, and racism. Obsessive trivia can be used to bore mainstream audiences while building up subcultural capital. Specialist stores on the fringes of society (or websites which prominently partner with hardcore pornographic sites) can be used to reinforce the outsider nature of cult film fandom, especially when they use erotic or gory imagery. By assuming a preexisting knowledge of trivia, non-fans can be excluded. Previous articles and controversies can also be alluded to without explanation. Casual readers and non-fans will thus be left out of discussions and debates, as they lack enough information to meaningfully contribute. When fans like a cult film for the wrong reasons, such as casting or characters aimed at mainstream appeal, they may be ridiculed. Thus, fandom can keep the mainstream at bay while defining themselves in terms of the \"Other\", a philosophical construct divergent from social norms. Commercial aspects of fandom (such as magazines or books) can also be defined in terms of \"otherness\" and thus valid to consume: consumers purchasing independent or niche publications are discerning consumers, but the mainstream is denigrated. Irony or self-deprecating humor can also be used. In online communities, different subcultures attracted to transgressive films can clash over values and criteria for subcultural capital. Even within subcultures, fans who break subcultural scripts, such as denying the affectivity of a disturbing film, will be ridiculed for their lack of authenticity.\n\nThe critic Michael Medved characterized examples of the \"so bad it's good\" class of low-budget cult film through books such as \"The Golden Turkey Awards\". These films include financially fruitless and critically scorned films that have become inadvertent comedies to film buffs, such as \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" (1959) and \"The Room\" (2003). Similarly, Paul Verhoeven's \"Showgirls\" (1995) bombed in theaters but developed a cult following on video. Catching on, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer capitalized on the film's ironic appeal and marketed it as a cult film. Sometimes fans will impose their own interpretation of films which have attracted derision, such as reinterpreting an earnest melodrama as a comedy. Jacob deNobel of the \"Carroll County Times\" states that films can be perceived as nonsensical or inept when audiences misunderstand avant-garde filmmaking or misinterpret parody. Films such as \"Rocky Horror\" can be misinterpreted as \"weird for weirdness' sake\" by people unfamiliar with the cult films that it parodies. deNobel ultimately rejects the use of the label \"so bad it's good\" as mean-spirited and often misapplied. Alamo Drafthouse programmer Zack Carlson has further said that any film which succeeds in entertaining an audience is good, regardless of irony. The rise of the Internet and on-demand films has led critics to question whether \"so bad it's good\" films have a future now that people have such diverse options in both availability and catalog, though fans eager to experience the worst films ever made can lead to lucrative showings for local theaters and merchandisers.\n\nChuck Kleinhans states that the difference between a guilty pleasure and a cult film can be as simple as the number of fans; David Church raises the question of how many people it takes to form a cult following, especially now that home video makes fans difficult to count. As these cult films become more popular, they can bring varied responses from fans that depend on different interpretations, such as camp, irony, genuine affection, or combinations thereof. Earnest fans, who recognize and accept the film's faults, can make minor celebrities of the film's cast, though the benefits are not always clear. Cult film stars known for their camp can inject subtle parody or signal when films should not be taken seriously. Campy actors can also provide comic book supervillains for serious, artistic-minded films. This can draw fan acclaim and obsession more readily than subtle, method-inspired acting. Mark Chalon Smith of the \"Los Angeles Times\" says technical faults may be forgiven if a film makes up for them in other areas, such as camp or transgressive content. Smith states that the early films of John Waters are amateurish and less influential than claimed, but Waters' outrageous vision cements his place in cult cinema. Films such as \"Myra Breckinridge\" (1970) and \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\" (1970) can experience critical reappraisal later, once their camp excess and avant-garde filmmaking are better accepted, and films that are initially dismissed as frivolous are often reassessed as campy. Films that intentionally try to appeal to fans of camp may end up alienating them, as the films become perceived as trying too hard or not authentic.\n\nAccording to academic Brigid Cherry, nostalgia \"is a strong element of certain kinds of cult appeal.\" When Veoh added many cult films to their site, they cited nostalgia as a factor for their popularity. Academic I. Q. Hunter describes cult films as \"New Hollywood \"in extremis\"\" and a form of nostalgia for that period. Ernest Mathijs instead states that cult films use nostalgia as a form of resistance against progress and capitalistic ideas of a time-based economy. By virtue of the time travel plot, \"Back to the Future\" permits nostalgia for both the 1950s and 1980s. Many members of its nostalgic cult following are too young to have been alive during those periods, which Emma Pett interprets as fondness for retro aesthetics, nostalgia for when they saw the film rather than when it was released, and looking to the past to find a better time period. Similarly, films directed by John Hughes have taken hold in midnight movie venues, trading off of nostalgia for the 1980s and an ironic appreciation for their optimism. Mathijs and Sexton describe \"Grease\" (1978) as a film nostalgic about an imagined past that has acquired a nostalgic cult following. Other cult films, such as \"Streets of Fire\" (1984), create a new fictional world based on nostalgic views of the past. Cult films may also subvert nostalgia, such as \"The Big Lebowski\", which introduces many nostalgic elements and then reveals them as fake and hollow. Nathan Lee of the \"New York Sun\" identifies the retro aesthetic and nostalgic pastiche in films such as \"Donnie Darko\" as factors in its popularity among midnight movie crowds.\n\nAuthor Tomas Crowder-Taraborrelli describes midnight movies as a reaction against the political and cultural conservatism in America, and Joan Hawkins identifies the movement as running the gamut from anarchist to libertarian, united in their anti-establishment attitude and punk aesthetic. These films are resistant to simple categorization and are defined by the fanaticism and ritualistic behaviors of their audiences. Midnight movies require a night life and an audience willing to invest themselves actively. Hawkins states that these films took a rather bleak point of view due to the living conditions of the artists and the economic prospects of the 1970s. Like the surrealists and dadaists, they not only satirically attacked society but also the very structure of film – a counter-cinema that deconstructs narrative and traditional processes. In the late 1980s and 1990s, midnight movies transitioned from underground showings to home video viewings; eventually, a desire for community brought a resurgence, and \"The Big Lebowski\" kick-started a new generation. Demographics shifted, and more hip and mainstream audiences were drawn to them. Although studios expressed skepticism, large audiences were drawn to box office flops, such as \"Donnie Darko\" (2001), The Warriors (film) (1979) and \"Office Space\" (1999). Modern midnight movies retain their popularity and have been strongly diverging from mainstream films shown at midnight. Mainstream cinemas, eager to disassociate themselves from negative associations and increase profits, have begun abandoning midnight screenings. Although classic midnight movies have dropped off in popularity, they still bring reliable crowds.\n\nAlthough seemingly at odds with each other, art and exploitation films are frequently treated as equal and interchangeable in cult fandom, listed alongside each other and described in similar terms: their ability to provoke a response. The most exploitative aspects of art films are thus played up and their academic recognition ignored. This flattening of culture follows the popularity of post-structuralism, which rejects a hierarchy of artistic merit and equates exploitation and art. Mathijs and Sexton state that although cult films are not synonymous with exploitation, as is occasionally assumed, this is a key component; they write that exploitation, which exists on the fringes of the mainstream and deals with taboo subjects, is well-suited for cult followings. Academic David Andrews writes that cult softcore films are \"the most masculinized, youth-oriented, populist, and openly pornographic softcore area.\" The sexploitation films of Russ Meyer were among the first to abandon all hypocritical pretenses of morality and were technically proficient enough to gain a cult following. His persistent vision saw him received as an auteur worthy of academic study; director John Waters attributes this to Meyer's ability to create complicated, sexually charged films without resorting to explicit sex. Myrna Oliver described Doris Wishman's exploitation films as \"crass, coarse, and camp ... perfect fodder for a cult following.\" \"Sick films\", the most disturbing and graphically transgressive films, have their own distinct cult following; these films transcend their roots in exploitation, horror, and art films. In 1960s and 1970s America, exploitation and art films shared audiences and marketing, especially in New York City's grindhouse cinemas.\n\nMathijs and Sexton state that genre is an important part of cult films; cult films will often mix, mock, or exaggerate the tropes associated with traditional genres. Science fiction, fantasy, and horror are known for their large and dedicated cult followings; as science fiction films become more popular, fans emphasize non-mainstream and less commercial aspects of it. B films, which are often conflated with exploitation, are as important to cult films as exploitation. Teodor Reljic of \"Malta Today\" states that cult B films are a realistic goal for Malta's burgeoning film industry. Genre films, B films that strictly adhere to genre limitations, can appeal to cult film fans: given their transgressive excesses, horror films are likely to become to cult films; films like \"Galaxy Quest\" (1999) highlight the importance of cult followings and fandom to science fiction; and authentic martial arts skills in Hong Kong action films can drive them to become cult favorites. Cult musicals can range from the traditional, such as \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952), which appeal to cult audiences through nostalgia, camp, and spectacle, to the more non-traditional, such as \"Cry-Baby\" (1990), which parodies musicals, and \"Rocky Horror\", which uses a rock soundtrack. Romantic fairy tale \"The Princess Bride\" (1987) failed to attract audiences in its original release, as the studio did not know how to market it. The freedom and excitement associated with cars can be an important part of drawing cult film fans to genre films, and they can signify action and danger with more ambiguity than a gun. \"Ad Week\" writes that cult B films, when released on home video, market themselves and need only enough advertising to raise curiosity or nostalgia.\n\nAnimation can provide wide open vistas for stories; the French film \"Fantastic Planet\" (1972) explored ideas beyond the limits of traditional, live-action science fiction films. Phil Hoad of \"The Guardian\" identifies \"Akira\" (1988) as introducing violent, adult Japanese animation (known as anime) to the West and paving the way for later works. Anime, according to academic Brian Ruh, is not a cult genre, but the lack of individual fandoms inside anime fandom itself lends itself to a bleeding over of cult attention and can help spread works internationally. Anime, which is often highly franchised, provides its fans with alternative fictional canons and points of view that can drive fan activity. The \"Ghost in the Shell\" franchise, for example, provided Japanese fans with enough bonus material and spinoffs that it encouraged cult tendencies. Markets that did not support the sale of these materials saw less cult activity. Ralph Bakshi's career has been marked with controversy: \"Fritz the Cat\" (1972), the first animated film to be rated \"X\" by the MPAA, provoked outrage for its racial caricatures and graphic depictions of sex, and \"Coonskin\" (1975) was decried as racist. Bakshi recalls that older animators had tired of \"kid stuff\" and desired edgier work, whereas younger animators hated his work for \"destroying the Disney images\". Eventually, his work would be reassessed and cult followings, which include Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, developed around several of his films. \"Heavy Metal\" (1981) faced similar denunciations from critics; Donald Liebenson of the \"Los Angeles Times\" cites the violence and sexual imagery as alienating critics, who did not know what to make of the film. It would go on to become a popular midnight movie and frequently bootlegged by fans, as licensing issues kept it from being released on video for many years.\n\nSensationalistic documentaries called mondo films replicate the most shocking and transgressive elements of exploitation films; they are usually modeled after \"sick films\" and cover similar subject matter. In \"The Cult Film Reader\", academics Mathijs and Mendik write that these documentaries often present non-Western societies as \"stereotypically mysterious, seductive, immoral, deceptive, barbaric or savage\". Though they can be interpreted as racist, Mathijs and Mendik state that they also \"exhibit a liberal attitude towards the breaking of cultural taboos\". Mondo films like \"Faces of Death\" mix real and fake footage freely, and they gain their cult following through the outrage and debate over authenticity that results. Like \"so bad it's good\" cult films, old propaganda and government hygiene films may be enjoyed ironically by more modern audiences for the camp value of the outdated themes and outlandish claims made about perceived social threats, such as drug use. Academic Barry K. Grant states that Frank Capra's \"Why We Fight\" World War II propaganda films are explicitly not cult, because they are \"slickly made and have proven their ability to persuade an audience.\" The sponsored film \"Mr. B Natural\" became a cult hit when it was broadcast on the satirical television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\"; cast member Trace Beaulieu cited these educational shorts as his favorite to mock on the show. Mark Jancovich states that cult audiences are drawn to these films because of their \"very banality or incoherence of their political positions\", unlike traditional cult films, which achieve popularity through auteurist radicalism.\n\nMark Shiel explains the rising popularity of cult films as an attempt by cinephiles and scholars to escape the oppressive conformity and mainstream appeal of even independent film, as well as a lack of condescension in both critics and the films; Academic Donna de Ville says it is a chance to subvert the dominance of academics and cinephiles. According to Xavier Mendik, \"academics have been really interested in cult movies for quite a while now.\" Mendik has sought to bring together academic interest and fandom through Cine-Excess, a film festival. I. Q. Hunter states that \"it's much easier to be a cultist now, but it is also rather more inconsequential.\" Citing the mainstream availability of \"Cannibal Holocaust\", Jeffrey Sconce rejects definitions of cult films based on controversy and excess, as they've now become meaningless. Cult films have influenced such diverse industries as cosmetics, music videos, and fashion. Cult films have shown up in less expected places; as a sign of his popularity, a bronze statue of Ed Wood has been proposed in his hometown, and \"L'Osservatore Romano\", the official newspaper of the Holy See, has courted controversy for its endorsement of cult films and pop culture. When cities attempt to renovate neighborhoods, fans have called attempts to demolish iconic settings from cult films \"cultural vandalism\". Cult films can also drive tourism, even when it is unwanted.\n\nAs far back as the 1970s, \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\" (1978) was designed specifically to be a cult film, and \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" was produced by 20th Century Fox, a major Hollywood studio. Over its decades-long release, \"Rocky Horror\" became the seventh highest grossing R-rated film when adjusted for inflation; Journalist Matt Singer has questioned whether \"Rocky Horror\"s popularity invalidates its cult status. Founded in 1974, Troma Entertainment, an independent studio, would become known for both its cult following and cult films. In the 1980s, Danny Peary's \"Cult Movies\" (1981) would influence director Edgar Wright and film critic Scott Tobias of \"The A.V. Club\". The rise of home video would have a mainstreaming effect on cult films and cultish behavior, though some collectors would be unlikely to self-identify as cult film fans. Film critic Joe Bob Briggs began reviewing drive-in theater and cult films, though he faced much criticism as an early advocate of exploitation and cult films. Briggs highlights the mainstreaming of cult films by pointing out the respectful obituaries that cult directors have received from formerly hostile publications and acceptance of politically incorrect films at mainstream film festivals. This acceptance is not universal, though, and some critics have resisted this mainstreaming of paracinema. Beginning in the 1990s, director Quentin Tarantino would have the greatest success in turning cult films mainstream. Tarantino later used his fame to champion obscure cult films that had influenced him and set up the short-lived Rolling Thunder Pictures, which distributed several of his favorite cult films. Tarantino's clout led Phil Hoad of \"The Guardian\" to call Tarantino the world's most influential director.\n\nAs major Hollywood studios and audiences both become savvy to cult films, productions once limited to cult appeal have instead become popular hits, and cult directors have become hot properties known for more mainstream and accessible films. Remarking on the popular trend of remaking cult films, Claude Brodesser-Akner of \"New York\" magazine states that Hollywood studios have been superstitiously hoping to recreate past successes rather than trading on nostalgia. Their popularity would bring some critics to proclaim the death of cult films now that they have finally become successful and mainstream, are too slick to attract a proper cult following, lack context, or are too easily found online. In response, David Church says that cult film fans have retreated to more obscure and difficult to find films, often using illegal distribution methods, which preserves the outlaw status of cult films. Virtual spaces, such as online forums and fan sites, replace the traditional fanzines and newsletters. Cult film fans consider themselves collectors, rather than consumers, as they associate consumers with mainstream, Hollywood audiences. This collecting can take the place of fetishization of a single film. Addressing concerns that DVDs have revoked the cult status of films like \"Rocky Horror\", academic Mikel J. Koven states that small scale screenings with friends and family can replace midnight showings. Koven also identifies television shows, such as \"Twin Peaks\", as retaining more traditional cult activities inside popular culture. David Lynch himself has not ruled out another television series, as studios have become reluctant to take chances on non-mainstream ideas. Despite this, the Alamo Drafthouse has capitalized on cult films and the surrounding culture through inspiration drawn from \"Rocky Horror\" and retro promotional gimmickry. They sell out their shows regularly and have acquired a cult following of their own.\n\nAcademic Bob Batchelor, writing in \"Cult Pop Culture\", states that the internet has democratized cult culture and destroyed the line between cult and mainstream. Fans of even the most obscure films can communicate online with each other in vibrant communities. Although known for their big-budget blockbusters, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have criticized the current Hollywood system of gambling everything on the opening weekend of these productions. Geoffrey Macnab of \"The Independent\" instead suggests that Hollywood look to capitalize on cult films, which have exploded in popularity on the internet. The rise of social media has been a boon to cult films. Sites such as Twitter have displaced traditional venues for fandom and courted controversy from cultural critics who are unamused by campy cult films. After a clip from one of his films went viral, director-producer Roger Corman made a distribution deal with YouTube. Found footage which had originally been distributed as cult VHS collections eventually went viral on YouTube, which opened them to new generations of fans. Films such as \"Birdemic\" (2008) and \"The Room\" (2003) gained quick, massive popularity, as prominent members of social networking sites discussed them. Their rise as \"instant cult classics\" bypasses the years of obscurity that most cult films labor under. In response, critics have described the use of viral marketing as astroturfing and an attempt to manufacture cult films.\n\nI. Q. Hunter identifies a prefabricated cult film style which includes \"deliberately, insulting bad films\", \"slick exercises in dysfunction and alienation\", and mainstream films \"that sell themselves as worth obsessing over\". Writing for NPR, Scott Tobias states that Don Coscarelli, whose previous films effortlessly attracted cult followings, has drifted into this realm. Tobias criticizes Coscarelli as trying too hard to appeal to cult audiences and sacrificing internal consistency for calculated quirkiness. Influenced by the successful online hype of \"The Blair Witch Project\" (1999), other films have attempted to draw online cult fandom with the use of prefabricated cult appeal. \"Snakes on a Plane\" (2006) is an example that attracted massive attention from curious fans. Uniquely, its cult following preceded the film's release and included speculative parodies of what fans imagined the film might be. This reached the point of convergence culture when fan speculation began to impact on the film's production. Although it was proclaimed a cult film and major game-changer before it was released, it failed to win either mainstream audiences or maintain its cult following. In retrospect, critic Spencer Kornhaber would call it a serendipitous novelty and a footnote to a \"more naive era of the Internet\". However, it became influential in both marketing and titling. This trend of \"instant cult classics\" which are hailed yet fail to attain a lasting following is described by Matt Singer, who states that the phrase is an oxymoron.\n\nCult films are often approached in terms of auteur theory, which states that the director's creative vision drives a film. This has fallen out of favor in academia, creating a disconnect between cult film fans and critics. Matt Hills states that auteur theory can help to create cult films; fans that see a film as continuing a director's creative vision are likely to accept it as cult. According to academic Greg Taylor, auteur theory also helped to popularize cult films when middlebrow audiences found an accessible way to approach avant-garde film criticism. Auteur theory provided an alternative culture for cult film fans while carrying the weight of scholarship. By requiring repeated viewings and extensive knowledge of details, auteur theory naturally appealed to cult film fans. Taylor further states that this was instrumental in allowing cult films to break through to the mainstream. Academic Joe Tompkins states that this auteurism is often highlighted when mainstream success occurs. This may take the place of – and even ignore – political readings of the director. Cult films and directors may be celebrated for their transgressive content, daring, and independence, but Tompkins argues that mainstream recognition requires they be palatable to corporate interests who stand to gain much from the mainstreaming of cult film culture. While critics may champion revolutionary aspects of filmmaking and political interpretation, Hollywood studios and other corporate interests will instead highlight only the aspects that they wish to legitimize in their own films, such as sensational exploitation. Someone like George Romero, whose films are both transgressive and subversive, will have the transgressive aspects highlighted while the subversive aspects are ignored.\n\n"}

This group of bacteria, together with denitrifying fungi and archaea, is capable of performing denitrification as part of the nitrogen cycle. They metabolise nitrogenous compounds using various enzymes, turning nitrogen oxides back to nitrogen gas or nitrous oxide.\n\nThere is a great diversity in bacteria capable of performing denitrification. Members of this group encompass most bacterial phyla and therefore possess a wide variety of physiological traits. Denitrifying bacteria have been identified in over 50 genera with over 125 different species and are estimated to represent 10-15% of bacteria population in water, soil and sediment.\nDenitrifying include for example several species of \"Pseudomonas\", \"Alkaligenes\" , \"Bacillus\" and others. \nThe majority of denitrifying bacteria are facultative aerobic heterotrophs that switch from aerobic respiration to denitrification when oxygen as an available terminal electron acceptor (TEA) runs out. This forces the organism to use nitrate to be used as a TEA. Because the diversity of denitrifying bacteria is so large, this group can thrive in a wide range of habitats including some extreme environments such as environments that are highly saline and high in temperature. Aerobic denitrifiers can conduct an aerobic respiratory process in which nitrate is converted gradually to N (NO →NO → NO → NO → N ), using nitrate reductase (Nar or Nao), nitrite reductase (Nir), nitric oxide reductase (Nor), and nitrous oxide reductase (Nos). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that aerobic denitrifiers mainly belong to α-, β- and γ-\"Proteobacteria\". \n\nDenitrifying bacteria use denitrification to generate ATP.\n\nThe most common denitrification process is outlined below, with the nitrogen oxides being converted back to gaseous nitrogen:\n\n2 NO + 10 e + 12 H → N + 6 HO\n\nThe result is one molecule of nitrogen and six molecules of water. Denitrifying bacteria are a part of the N cycle, and consists of sending the N back into the atmosphere. \nThe reaction above is the overall half reaction of the process of denitrification. The reaction can be further divided into different half reactions each requiring a specific enzyme. The transformation from nitrate to nitrite is performed by nitrate reductase (Nar)\n\nNO + 2 H + 2 e → NO + HO\n\nNitrite reductase (Nir) then converts nitrite into nitric oxide\n\n2 NO + 4 H + 2 e → 2 NO + 2 HO\nNitric oxide reductase (Nor) then converts nitric oxide into nitrous oxide\n\n2 NO + 2 H + 2 e → NO + HO\n\nNitrous oxide reductase (Nos) terminates the reaction by converting nitrous oxide into dinitrogen\nNO + 2 H + 2 e → N + HO\n\nIt is important to note that any of the products produced at any step can be exchanged with the soil environment.\n\nThe process of denitrification can lower the fertility of soil as nitrogen, a growth-limiting factor, is removed from the soil and lost to the atmosphere. This loss of nitrogen to the atmosphere can eventually be regained via introduced nutrients, as part of the nitrogen cycle. Some nitrogen may also be fixated by species of nitrifying bacteria and the cyanobacteria. Another important environmental issue concerning denitrification is the fact that the process tends to produce large amounts of by-products. Examples of by-products are nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (NO). NO is an ozone depleting species and NO is a potent greenhouse gas which can contribute to global warming.\n\n"}

Most compensators worked by repeating earlier video scan-lines over short periods of signal loss; one early such system, \"Mincom\" was developed in the 1960s by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the company now known as 3M. Because of the high cost of the 3M device at the time, BBC R&D engineers developed a simpler, less expensive unit based on a sample-and-hold technique for in-house use.\n\nDedicated drop-out compensators were eventually superseded by the incorporation of drop-out compensation functionality into timebase correctors based on analog-to-digital conversion and digital line stores. \n\nThe advent of compressed digital video systems finally eliminated the need for line-based drop-out compensators. Most low-level media errors, such as those caused by tape damage or imperfections, are now dealt with by forward error correction techniques, and those which overwhelm the FEC layer are typically too severe to remedy using simple line-based error concealment techniques, because damage to the compressed bitstream will often damage large parts of the video image. However, since occasional signal drop-outs can still occur, either through severe tape damage or because of packet loss in packetized video transmission, modern error concealment techniques that are aware of the structure of the compressed video format have been developed to deal with these.\n"}

Members of the multi-national team include dancers, composers, dramatic advisors and light designers. The Editta Braun Company’s work pursues political themes, including intercultural communication and feminist questions. The company is particularly known for the \"body theatre\" performance pieces \"Lufus\", \"Luvos, vol. 2\", and \"planet LUVOS\". The Editta Braun Company has toured in Europe, Asia, Africa and performs at both large and specialty festivals.\n\nBraun was one of a group of students who formed the dance collective Vorgänge 1982. She founded her own company shortly before the group broke up in 1989. In 1996, French composer and musician Thierry Zaboitzeff began creating sound tracks to accompany the group's productions; most have been released as albums. Thomas Hinterberger and Peter Thalhamer have designed the lighting for many pieces.\n\nThe company collaborated with Egyptian director Mahmoud Aboudoma and his drama ensemble to create \"Coppercity 2001\", based on one of the tales from 1001 Nights.\n\nIn 2002, the company began to incorporate texts into their productions, for example, Manfred Wöhlcke’s sociological essay Soziale Entropie and literary variations of the Arthur myth. In 2004, Austrian author Barbara Neuwirth wrote the text for \"Zurydike\", a piece which was commissioned for the Brucknerfest in Linz, and included a chamber orchestra, drama and dance ensemble. \nIn 2004 the company increased its staff of artistic directors and choreographers to include Arturas Valudskis, Rebecca Murgi, Shlomo Bitton, Teresa Ranieri, Mahmoud Aboudoma, and Robert Pienz.\nOver the years, outstanding artists from various disciplines (besides dance: drama, composition, direction, writing, dramaturgy, video, light design) have contributed their creative potential to the company. In the beginning, the company’s dance style was especially influenced by Céline Guillaume and Georg Blaschke, the work together with dance legend Jean Babilée, for whom Jean Cocteau and Roland Petit created Le jeune homme et la mort, was particularly sensational, immensely furthering the company’s international acclaim. Composer Peter Valentin contributed his work during this time.\n\nFor ten years, dancer Barbara Motschiunik played a main role in each production; in 2006, Anna Maria Müller and Tomaz Simatovic joined the group, joining with Juan Dante and Murillo Bobadilla.\n\nSince 2010, several younger performers have joined the company, including Spela Vodeb, and the many performances have been developed with dramaticist Gerda Poschmann-Reichenau.\n\n\"Luvos\" is a series of body theater performances. The series premiered in 1985 as \"Kollektiv Vorgänge’s Lufus\".\n\nBetween 2001 and 2012, \"Luvos, vol.2\" was performed worldwide before audiences totalling about 15,000 people, in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Thessaloniki, Novosibirsk and Moscow, Marseille, Limassol and Nicosia, Brussels, Tallinn, Kaunas, Riga, Vienna, Salzburg and Linz.

They have continued to participate as art creators after World War II through modern times by either following the traditional way of making art or by departing from such tradition by embracing modernism and other modes of expressing themselves through art.\n\nThe first Filipino woman to achieve a level of prominence in the art world, while the Philippines was under the management of Spain, was sculptor Pelagia Mendoza y Gotianquin (1867-1939). The first female student at the \"Academia de Dibujo y Pintura\" (Academy of Drawing and Painting), Mendoza studied sculpting under the mentorship of Agustin Saez and Lorenzo Rocha. Her bust of Christopher Columbus won an award during the quattrocentenial celebration of the Discovery of the Americas.\n\nIn the field of painting in the Philippines, the works of art of Carmen Zaragoza y Rojas became notable. Zaragoza was the painter of the masterpiece known as Dos Inteligentias (literally “Two Intellectuals”, 1892), a painting that won Zaragoza a prize during the 1892 anniversary of Christopher Columbus and his discovery of the Americas. Two years later, during the 1895 Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (1895 Regional Exposition in the Philippines), Zaragoza would be awarded a copper medal for creating two landscapes.\n\nOther notable Filipino women painters during the time of Zaragoza were Concha Paterno, Adele Paterno, Conception de Montilla, Patricia Reyes, Ana Garcia Plana, Josefa Majo, Concepcion Ortiz, Olimpia Teran de Abella, Rafaella Calanta, and Femina David.\n\nAnother woman painter who excelled in the field of art in the Philippines was Paz Paterno. Her important painting known as \"Still Life\" was decorated with native fruits such as lanzones (\"Lansium domesticum\"), bananas, mabolos (velvet apple, \"Diospyros blancoi\"), atis (sugar-apple, the fruit of \"Annona squamosa\"), balimbings (carambola or starfruit, fruit of \"Averrhoa carambola\"), pili nuts, and coconuts.\n\nAfter World War II, new female artists emerged carrying the modernistic themes in their art. Among these artists were painters such as Anita Magsaysay-Ho, the first Filipino woman abstractionist Nena Saguil, and Philippine Art Gallery owner Lyd Arguilla. During the 1970s and the 1980s, women printmakers and graphic artists began contributing their works of imagery to the Philippine art scene, such as Brenda Fajardo, Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi, and Imelda Cajipe-Endaya. This period also saw the emergence of women art collectives in the Philippines such as \"Kasibulan,\" for which these artists where members of. Women sculptors like Agnes Arellano, Julie Lluch, Genera Banzon, and Francesca Enriquez also made their noteworthy impressions to the field of sculpting by creating non-traditional statues.\n\nOfelio Gelvezon-Tequi, a pioneer in the print-making industry, created a notable printed portrait of a widow standing next to the casket of her dead husband. The casket in the image was draped with a Philippine flag, while the widow was standing and holding vigil next to the coffin. Gelvezon-Tequi also produced works made of acrylic-on-paper in 1995. Her masterpieces later focused on portraits of Filipino women such former Philippine President Corazon Aquino, the assassins of her husband Benigno Aquino, Jr., and about plotters of coup d'etats.\n\nAs a mixed-media artist, Brenda Fajardo used art to describe folk magic and folklore of the Sulod people (part of the Aeta ethnic group) of Panay province. Fajardo is a member of Faculty of Arts at the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City. She was also the curator of the Vargas Museum of Art located inside the Diliman campus of the University of the Philippines. She was a visiting professor at the St. Norbert College in the United States.\n\nOn the other hand, Nena Saguil (died in 1994) expressed her artistry through the use of pen and ink to draw abstract images employing dots, bubble, vortices, and rays, including an imagery of an \"enlarged hymen\" and \"a woman cleaning a toilet bowl splattered with human excrement\". Saguil moved to France to live in Paris.\n\nImelda Cajipe-Endaya ventured in making fragmented artistic scenes by recycling materials found in the household to depict the life and responsibilities of the Filipina domestic helper working in the Philippines and abroad, to integrate their unseen roles as the working wife, mother, and daughter while being miles away from their motherland or from their hometowns in the Philippines.\n\nPaulina Constancia is considered one of the most prolific and inspiring female artists in Cebu, Philippines. She is a multifaceted artist best known for her bright colored, whimsical narratives painted on quilts and tiles that are also reflected in her writing. Paulina has exhibited her art in the Philippines, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Mexico & in various cities in the United States & Canada. In 1997, she was presented by the Philippine Centennial Coordinating Council of Northeast USA in a show called \"Here's to Sunny!\" at the Philippine Center in New York City. In 2000, her collection of painted quilts called \"Kleur en ik in de geheime tuin /Hue & I in a Secret Garden\" was presented by the VHC-Vereniging Haarlemmermeer-Cebu (sister cities organization of Haarlemmermeer and Cebu) at the Centrum voor Kunst en Cultuur in Hoofddrop and Kunst 2001 Gallery in Badhoevedorp.\n\nAnother noteworthy Filipino woman artist was painter and sculptor Elsie \"Inday\" Cadapan whose 1997 sculpture was unveiled for display by former Philippine President Corazon Aquino on October 30, 1997 at the front lobby of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) building.\nOn April 21, 2012, the Thomson Reuters Foundation reported that Alma Quinto launched the \"House of Comfort Art Project\", a program of the House of Comfort Art Network (ARTHOC), a non-governmental organization that uses art to help sexually abused Filipino women and girls through their rehabilitation. The project employs the use of scrap materials to teach women how to create miniature houses, as a means of expressing their feelings long after the occurrence of abuse and build positive experiences in their minds and to once again become in control of their bodies.\n"}

Flex dancers, referred to as \"flexers\", often perform shirtless and incorporate hat tricks in their performance for showmanship. \n\nBefore flexing gained mainstream exposure it was featured as early as 1992 on a local television show in New York City called 'Flex N Brooklyn’. The dance is primarily performed to a mix of dancehall, reggae, and \"...a chopped-up instrumental called the 'Volume' riddim\". According to Pitchfork.com, the producers of this new genre refer to it as FDM (Flex Dance Music). Although flexing looks like a subgenre of popping, it did not come from hip-hop dance, funk music, or hip-hop culture. It evolved from a Jamaican style of street dance called bruk-up. In a 2009 interview with \"WireTap\" magazine, dancer Stefan \"Mr. Wiggles\" Clemente described bruk-up as a \"reggae style of animation.\"\n\nFlexing has been performed on the third season of \"America's Best Dance Crew\" (ABDC), on the second season of \"The LXD\", and at the Guggenheim Museum as part of the YouTube Play event. In 2011, the \"Huffington Post\" published a brief news article on flex dancers Bones the Machine and DJ Aaron.

{"id": "2546429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2546429", "title": "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter", "text": "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter\n\nFriday the 13th: The Final Chapter is a 1984 American slasher film directed by Joseph Zito, produced by Frank Mancuso Jr. and starring Corey Feldman, Ted White, Kimberly Beck, and Crispin Glover. It is the fourth installment in the \"Friday the 13th\" film series. Picking up immediately after the events of \"Friday the 13th Part III\", the story follows a presumed-dead Jason Voorhees brought to the morgue, where he spontaneously revives and escapes. He then returns to Crystal Lake to continue his killing spree, targeting a family and a group of neighboring teenagers; it is the first film to feature the character of Tommy Jarvis.\n\nMuch like \"Friday the 13th Part III\", the film was originally supposed to be the final installment in the series. Mancuso Jr. wanted to conclude the series as he felt nobody respected him for his assisting work on \"Friday the 13th\" regardless of how much the films earned at the box office, as well as wanting to work on other projects. Paramount Pictures also supported the decision, as they were aware of the declining popularity of slasher films at the time of its release. As a result, the film was marketed as \"The Final Chapter\" to ensure it as such. Make-up artist Tom Savini, who worked on the first film, returned for the sequel as he wanted to help kill off Jason, who he helped create.\n\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released in October 1984, but Paramount pushed the date up to April 13, 1984. Upon its theatrical release, the film earned approximately $11 million on its opening weekend and grossed $32 million in the United States on a budget of $2.6 million, making it the fourth most attendance of any film in the \"Friday the 13th\" series with approximately 9,815,700 tickets sold. The film received generally negative reviews. Despite it originally set to be the final film, the success of the film prompted another sequel, \"\", eleven months later.\n\nThe night after the events at Higgins Haven, police clean up the grounds and Jason Voorhees's body, believed to be dead, is taken to the morgue. At the hospital, Jason spontaneously revives and escapes from the cold storage, murdering the coroner Axel with a hacksaw and gutting Nurse Morgan with a scalpel. The following day, a group of teenagers drive to Crystal Lake for the weekend. The group consists of Paul, his girlfriend Sam, virgin Sara, her boyfriend Doug, socially awkward Jimmy, and jokester Ted. On the way, the group comes across Pamela Voorhees's tombstone and a hitchhiker, who is soon killed by Jason.\n\nThe teens arrive and meet neighbors Trish Jarvis, her twelve-year-old brother Tommy, their mother, and the family dog Gordon. While going for a walk the next day, the teens meet twin sisters Tina and Terri, and go skinny dipping with them. Trish and Tommy happen upon the scene, and Trish is invited to a party to take place that night. Afterwards, when their car breaks down, Trish and Tommy are helped out by a young man named Rob. They take him to their house, where Tommy shows Rob several monster masks he made himself before Rob leaves to go camping.\n\nLater that night, the teens begin the party. A jealous Sam sees Tina flirting with Paul and leaves. She goes out to the lake where Jason impales her from under a raft. When Paul goes out to look for her, he is stabbed in the groin with a harpoon gun. Terri tries to leave the party early, but before she can get on her bike Jason stabs her with a spear. After sleeping with Tina, Jimmy goes downstairs to get a bottle of wine. Jason pins his hand with a corkscrew before striking him in the face with a meat cleaver. Tina looks out a window upstairs when she is grabbed by Jason and thrown to her death, crashing on the car. While a stoned Ted watches vintage stag films with a film projector, he is stabbed in the head with a kitchen knife from the other side of the projector screen. Jason then goes upstairs where Doug and Sara finish making love in the shower. After Sara leaves, Jason kills Doug by crushing his head against the shower tile. When Sara screams upon finding Doug's body, she tries to escape only for Jason to drive a double-bit axe through the front door, killing her.\n\nTrish and Tommy return from town and discover the power outage. While looking for their mother, who had been killed by Jason earlier, Trish goes to find Rob for help. It is revealed that Rob is actually the brother of Jason's victim Sandra. Rob further explains to her that Jason is still alive and he came to Crystal Lake to get revenge for the murder of his sister. \n\nWorried for Tommy's safety, Trish and Rob return to the house. They then go next door to investigate and discover the teens' bodies. Gordon flees, and Rob is killed by Jason in the basement as Trish runs home, taking Rob's machete with her. She and Tommy barricade the house, but Jason breaks in and chases them into Tommy's room. Trish lures Jason out of the house and escapes, then returns home and is devastated to learn that Tommy is still there. She senses Jason behind her and tries to fight him off with the machete but is overpowered. Tommy, having disguised himself to look like Jason as a child, distracts him long enough for Trish to hit him with the machete, but she merely whacks off his mask. As Trish stands horrified at Jason's deformed face, Tommy takes the machete and strikes it in the side of his skull, causing him to collapse to the floor and split his head upon impact. When Tommy notices that Jason's fingers are slightly moving, he continues to hack at his body screaming, \"Die! Die!\" while Trish repeatedly yells out his name.\n\nAt the hospital, Trish is visited by Tommy. He rushes in, embraces her, and gives a disturbed look while staring ahead.\n\nWhen \"Friday the 13th Part III\" was released, it was initially supposed to end the series as a trilogy, however there was no moniker to indicate it as such. In 1983, there were rumors that Paramount Pictures billed the fourth film as \"The Final Chapter\" as a result of them feeling embarrassed by their association with the series. Despite how Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel claimed this in their review of the film on \"At the Movies\", Paramount Pictures was aware that the slasher genre had been declining in interest. However, the idea came from producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. (the son of Paramount CEO Frank Mancuso, Sr.) as he began to resent the series due to how he felt nobody respected him for working on \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" as an production assistant and \"Part III\" as producer, regardless of how much money the films earned. As a result of this and him wanting to work on different projects, he wanted to conclude the series by killing off Jason.\n\nThe filmmakers wanted Joseph Zito, who had previously worked on \"The Prowler\", to direct and write the screenplay for the film. He initially claimed that he wasn't a writer, but he later accepted it when the contract offered him double payment for directing and writing. Zito secretly used the extra salary to hire Barney Cohen to write the script. Their process entailed Zito taking one-hour phone calls every night with Phil Scuderi to discuss the film's screenplay and story. He then met Cohen in a New York apartment to use the ideas Scuderi had offered, which then they would turn into script pages sent that day to Scuderi in Boston to be discussed again over the phone. Cohen remained credited for writing the film, but Zito and Cohen eventually got into trouble with the Writer's Guild of America as a result.\n\nPrevious \"Friday the 13th\" films generally favored young women being the final girl. However, this is the first film in the series to not only have two survivors instead of one, but one of them being a child. The filmmakers believed this aspect has never been done before in a slasher film, as well as them wanting to create characters that the audience don't want to see harmed or killed. By including the Jarvis family (a divorced mother, a teenage daughter, and a pre-teen son) opposite the usual cast of teenagers, they could generate more drama and resonant tragedy such the implication of Mrs. Jarvis killed outside by Jason, and thus remaining debatable how intentional the parallels are between Jason and Tommy. Tommy's interest in make-up effects served as an homage to Tom Savini.\n\nCamilla More initially auditioned for the Samantha, but when the filmmakers discovered she had a twin sister they were instead offered the roles of Tina and Terri. They were swayed by the twins idea that Carry only needed to read one line.\n\nAmy Steel, who starred as heroine Ginny Field in \"Friday the 13th Part 2\", co-starred with Peter Barton on the sitcom \"The Powers of Matthew Star\". Barton was offered the role of Doug when the sitcom was cancelled, but he was initially reluctant as he wanted no part in any horror film, especially after he disliked working on \"Hell Night\". However, because Steel was involved in \"Part 2\", she talked him into doing the film. \n\nMake-up artist Tom Savini, who had not returned for \"Part 2\" and \"Part III\", agreed to work on the film to help kill off Jason, who he helped create in the original film.\n\nFilming commenced in October 1983 to January 1984 in Topanga Canyon and Newhall, California, 6 weeks over-schedule. It was originally set to be released in October 1984, but Frank Mancuso, Sr. pushed the release date to April 13, leaving them 6 weeks to complete post-production. The only time Paramount helped with the film's production, they rented a house in Malibu for the filmmakers to stay and conduct editing sessions, with food brought to them by the studio.\n\nThe film had a troubled production on set. As a result of the director's poor treatment and the film's budget, many of the actors had to perform uncomfortable or dangerous stunts for the movie. Judie Aronson was required to remain submerged in a highly freezing lake, in which she later developed hypothermia because of it, and Peter Barton was genuinely slammed against the shower wall when Jason attacks him. Ted White, who portrays Jason Voorhees, defended several of the actors by requesting Barton to have a crash pad, and threatening to quit when Zito refused to remove Aronson from the cold lake in-between takes. White and Zito maintained a hostile relationship on set, resulting in White demanding his name to be removed from the credits. According to White, Corey Feldman maintained a bratty attitude on set as a result from Zito's treatment. When filming the scene of Tommy hacking at Jason's body, which were two sandbags he was striking at, Feldman pretended the sandbags were Zito.\n\nAccording to the book \"Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th\", actress Kimberly Beck stated that she does not like the horror genre. In addition to this, she felt that the film was more of a C-movie rather than a B-movie. During filming, Kimberly Beck experienced strange encounters, including a man watching her while she ran in the park and receiving odd phone calls at all hours. This stopped when production was finished.\n\nActress Bonnie Hellman's agents told her about taking the role of the hitchhiker in the film. They told her she would not want to do it as they were no lines said for the character, but she accepted the role anyway.\n\nThe film's music was composed by Harry Manfredini, who composed the scores to all of the series' previous installments. On January 13, 2012, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 6-CD boxset containing Manfredini's scores from the first six entries of the film series. The release was sold out in less than 24 hours of availability. \n\nThe song \"Love Is a Lie\" by Lion is featured in the film, but not on the soundtrack.\n\n\"Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter\" opened on Friday, April 13, 1984, on 1,594 screens to weekend box office gross of $11,183,148; this was the sixth-highest of the year. The film would ultimately take in a total of $32,980,880 at the U.S. box office. It placed at number 26 on the list of the top-grossing films of 1984.\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 25% of 24 film critics have given the film a positive review; the rating average is 4.2 out of 10. The film received what \"The Week\" characterized as \"scathing reviews\", especially from film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, with the latter considering the film \"an immoral and reprehensible piece of trash\". Scott Meslow summarized Roger Ebert's criticism as calling it \"a cynical retread\" of the earlier films. Meslow instead says that the film attempts to kill off the series while focusing more on characterization than gore. In a series retrospective, Kyle Anderson of \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked it the best \"Friday the 13th\" film, complimenting both its narrative and kills.\n\n"}

Its mix of celebrity news, gossip, beauty advice and fashion is primarily aimed at women, although not as directly as in other women's magazines. It also features movie and music reviews, TV listings and major celebrity interviews. \n\n\"Heat\" was launched in February 1999 as a general interest entertainment magazine, at a cost of more than £4m. However, unlike other Emap (now Bauer) magazine launches before and after, it was not an immediate success, with a circulation below 100,000. A series of revamps quickly repositioned the magazine as a less serious, more gossip-oriented magazine aimed at women, and circulation quickly grew. A series of high-profile celebrity relationships, such as Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt provided ample material, while reality shows such as \"Big Brother\" and \"Pop Idol\" grew popular at just the right time to help fill pages. Heat achieved record sale figures when Jade Goody had a make-over and was first on the front cover after her stint in \"Big Brother 3\" (2002) and later when Nikki Grahame and Pete Bennett from \"Big Brother 7\" split and Grahame was interviewed for \"Heat\" in 2006.\n\nIn 2009–10 \"Heat\" spearheaded a campaign alongside Girls Aloud's Nicola Roberts advocating the banning of sunbed use in the UK for under-18s. The campaign was a success and a bill was passed by Parliament shortly before the 2010 General Election.\n\nThe site crashed after the magazine was mentioned on Channel 4's \"The Million Pound Drop\"; it took up to eight days to restore the site.\n\n\nAn edition of the magazine is also published in South Africa.\n\nHeatworld.com launched on 22 May 2007 and was edited by Julian Linley, who had been deputy editor of \"Heat\" magazine for five years. The site is an online interpretation of the magazine, emulating the mix of celebrity news, gossip and fashion. However, heatworld.com does not replicate magazine content and bases itself more on video and audio content and breaking news. The site is advertising funded.\n\nOn 25 September 2007, Heat Radio launched. The station is owned by Bauer Radio, a division of the company, Bauer, which owns \"Heat\" magazine. The station can be listened to through Freeview on channel number 716, across the UK on DAB Digital Radio, on their app or at heatradio.com.\n\nOn 3 July 2012, Heat launched, featuring celebrity news and music. The channel comes from Box Television, a joint venture between Bauer and Channel Four. It replaced Q on Sky, Smallworld Cable and Virgin Media in the UK, in Ireland on Sky and UPC Ireland and in Iceland on Síminn.\n\nIn May 2016, the channel was rebranded as Box Upfront.\n\nAs \"Heat\" magazine grew in popularity, spin off merchandise was released to cash in on its success. Current items carrying the \"Heat\" brand name are an exercise DVD titled \"Heat: Get That Celeb Look\" which was released in 2003, an interactive DVD game featuring celebrity questions, an annual for the year 2007 and in 2003 a set of mini books titled \"Say What\" were released containing quotes from celebrities such as Gareth Gates.\n\nIn an issue which was released on 27 November 2007, \"Heat\" used a photograph of Katie Price's disabled son, who suffers from septo-optic dysplasia, a rare condition which means he is visually impaired and suffers from hormonal deficiencies, causing him to easily gain weight and means he is partially blind, on a sticker which was included with the magazine, with the slogan \"Harvey wants to eat me!\" The magazine's editor Mark Frith made an apology for the offence caused by the sticker, and an apology was also posted on the magazine's website. A spokesperson for the Press Complaints Commission confirmed that Katie Price was planning to make a complaint about the matter. The magazine was also criticized in the press over the incident, with one editorial describing it as \"the lowest point in British journalism\".\n\nIn another issue released on 6–12 September 2014, \"Heat\" published a photograph of Justin Timberlake, husband to Jessica Biel, at a nightclub in Paris on the night after his performance. The star was photographed partying with women at the club as the title named it \"Justin Timberlake gets flirty with another woman, \"It is not his wife!\". Once the article, as well as the pictures surfaced it caused his marriage with Jessica to be manipulated. The singer and actor lodged a defamation claim in the courts in Ireland against the publishers of the celebrity title over an article, photographs and quotes attributed to Total Recall actor Biel. In the agreed statement read in the high court, a lawyer for the Heat publisher-Bauer group admitted the article – headlined and \"The flirty photos that rocked Justin and Jessica’s marriage\" – was based on an unfounded report. The article also included purported statements improperly attributed to Biel which the publishers said Heat now understands the actor never made. These allegations were eventually fixed as Bauer media group apologized on Heat Magazine's behalf, and a settlement was made in a hearing before the president of the High Court, Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns.\n\nHeat launched heat's Twitter Awards in 2013 that it says will celebrate “the joyful collision of celebrities and social media”.

{"id": "64998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64998", "title": "Kaiju", "text": "Kaiju\n\nKaiju originally referred to monsters and creatures from ancient Japanese legends. The word \"Kaiju\" first appears in \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\". After \"Sakoku\", opening Japan to foreign relations, Japanese came to use the term kaiju to express concepts from paleontology and legendary creatures from around the world. For example, in 1908, during the Meiji period, it was suggested that the extinct \"Ceratosaurus\" was alive in Alaska, referred to as kaiju. However, there are no traditional depictions of kaiju or kaiju-like creatures in Japanese folklore but rather the origins of kaiju are found in film. The title of the first film with the name of the Kaiju is , the title of \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" in Japan. \"Gojira\" (transliterated to \"Godzilla\") is regarded as the first kaiju film and was released in 1954. Tomoyuki Tanaka, a producer for Toho Studios in Tokyo, needed a film to release after his previous project was halted and upon seeing how well American Hollywood giant monster movie genre films \"King Kong\" and \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" had done in the box offices of Japan, as well as personally being a fan of the films, Tomoyuki Tanaka set out to make a new movie based on those American giant monster movies and created Godzilla. Tomoyuki Tanaka aimed to combine Hollywood giant monster movies with the re-emerged Japanese fears of atomic weapons, which came about due to the Daigo Fukuryū Maru fishing boat incident, and so he put a team together and created the concept of a radioactive giant creature emerging from the depths of the ocean which would become the iconic monster Godzilla. Godzilla was initially met with commercial success in Japan, inspiring an entire genre that came to be known as kaiju movies.\n\nThe term Kaiju translates to \"strange beast\". It is a science fiction and fantasy giant creature that often takes the role of either antagonist, protagonist, or force of nature. Godzilla is an example of a kaiju; others include Mothra, King Ghidorah, Mechagodzilla, King Kong, Rodan, Gamera, Gyaos, Daimajin and . The term \"ultra-kaiju\" is longhand for kaiju in the Ultra Series.\n\n roughly translates as large strange beast, and refers to the larger monsters. The literal translation is about a size difference between a kaiju and a daikaiju, with the implication that the daikaiju is the greater of the two types. The exact definition of what determines a kaiju from a daikaiju is debated. This term is used for the most powerful kaiju, the prefix dai- emphasizing great power or status. The first appearance of Daikaiju is in the Japanese title \"Rodan\", . Godzilla, Rodan and Mothra are the san daikaiju, the three great kaiju. An example of the term exists in a 1908 book.\n\n\"Kaijin\"(怪人) refers to humanoid kaiju found in tokusatsu, and is literally translated as \"monster man\" or \"mystery man\". The Villain of the week from the \"Kamen Rider Series\" are examples of \"kaijin\".\n\n\"Seijin\"(星人, star beings) is a Japanese suffixal term for extraterrestrial aliens, such as \"Kaseijin(火星人)\" which means \"Martian\". Aliens can also be called \"Uchujin\" (宇宙人) which means \"space beings\".\n\nA film featuring giant monsters or a single giant monster.\n\nToho has produced a variety of kaiju films over the years (many of which featured Godzilla, Rodan and Mothra) but other Japanese studios contributed to expanding the genre in Japan by producing films and shows of their own, including Daiei Film, Kadokawa Pictures, Tsuburaya Productions, and Shochiku and Nikkatsu Studios.\n\nA technique that was developed to portray the kaiju. An actor plays the part of the kaiju while in an articulated costume.\n\nEiji Tsubaraya, who was in charge of the special effects for \"Gojira\", developed a technique to animate the kaiju that became known colloquially as suitmation. Where Western monster movies often utilized a technique known as stop motion to animate the monsters, Tsubaraya decided to attempt to create suits, referred to as a creature suit, for a human (suit actor) to wear and act in. This was combined with the use of miniature models and scaled down city sets to create the illusion of a giant creature in a city. Due to the extreme stiffness of the latex or rubber suits often filming would be done at double speed, so that when the film was shown the monster was smoother and slower than the original shot. Kaiju films also utilized a form of puppetry interwoven between suitmation scenes which served to have shots that were physically impossible for the actor to perform in the suit. Later computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used for certain special sequences and monsters, but overall, the suitmation technique has been present in an overwhelming majority of kaiju films produced in Japan of all eras. American produced kaiju films strayed from this however, and began to focus on CGI in recent releases such as the 2014 release of \"Godzilla\". These suitmation techniques were adapted by almost all kaiju films, and continue even in modern Japanese kaiju films and tokusatsu although more stop motion and CGI are utilized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7324581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7324581", "title": "Morabaraba", "text": "Morabaraba\n\nMorabaraba is a traditional two-player strategy board game played in South Africa and Botswana with a slightly different variation played in Lesotho. The game is known by many names in many languages, including \"mlabalaba\", \"mmela\" (in Setswana), \"muravava\", and \"umlabalaba\". The game is similar to twelve men's morris, a variation on the Roman board game nine men's morris.\n\nWhile some believe that \"morabaraba\" was introduced to Southern Africa by British settlers, morris variants exist in many parts of the world; e.g. India (\"char bhar\"), Ghana (\"achi\"), Kenya (\"shisimia\"), Somalia (\"shax\"), Zimbabwe (\"tsoro yemutwelve\"), the Philippines (\"tapatan\") and Mongolia (\"gurgaldaj\"). It is claimed that \"morabaraba\" boards carved in rock are dated to be at least 800 years old, which would exclude a European origin. However, many rock art images do not actually show \"morabaraba\", but the \"mancala\"-type game of \"moruba\" (using of cupules).\n\n\"Morabaraba\" is today most popular amongst rural African youth in Southern Africa. In the traditional European games like nine men's morris, the counters are commonly referred to as \"men\", but in the South African game the counters are referred to as \"cows\", the game being particularly popular amongst youth who herd cattle.\n\nAccording to the \"OxfordDictionaries.com\", the term \"morabaraba\" is derived from the Southern Sotho \"moraba-raba\", meaning 'to mill' or 'to go round in a circle'.\n\n\"Morabaraba\" is accessible and easy to learn, and games can be played quickly, but the strategic and tactical aspects of the game run deep. While it may be played on specially produced boards (or simulated by computer software as a video game), it is simple enough that a board can easily be scratched on a stone or into sand, with coins or pebbles (or whatever comes to hand) used as the pieces. The description below is compatible with Mind Sports South Africa's \"generally accepted rules\".\n\nThere are three main phases to the game:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently the International Wargames Federation is the international governing body for the game as a competitive sport, and Mind Sports South Africa (MSSA) is the South African governing body. MSSA is recognised by both the South African Department of Sports and Recreation and the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) .\n\nMSSA has developed amateur leagues, using different regional versions of the game, throughout the country, and has adopted a notation scoring system similar to that for nine men's morris.\n\nThe game is an official discipline of the Traditional World Games, which are held every five years. Tournaments were not just in South Africa, but also in Bangkok (Thailand), Melbourne (Australia), New Orleans (United States), Athens (Greece), and at the Epsom College in England.\n\nSince 1997, Morabaraba World Championships have been held, in three divisions: senior (i.e. adult males), women, and junior (boys and girls). Divisional winners are shown in the table below.\n\nThis is the variation typically played by Sesotho-speakers in South Africa and Lesotho. It differs from the standard form in that the board does not have diagonals between the center points of its sides and there is an additional intersection in the center of the board to prevent a draw.\n\nThis is a European variation that uses the same board as \"morabaraba\" but is played with eleven counters. This prevents a situation where the game can end in a draw in the placement phase.\n\nThe standard Welt–Mühlespiel–Dachverband notation for nine men's morris works well for \"morabaraba\" . It is very similar to algebraic notation in chess. The board is laid out on a grid, with the columns in the grid being labelled a–g (from left to right), and rows in the grid being labelled from 1–7 (bottom to top). Each point is then referred to by its coordinate; for example, the top-left point in the middle (not inner) square is labelled b6. Moves are then formatted as in chess or draughts: placing a piece is denoted simply by the square where it is placed; moving a piece by the from and to squares (e.g. c5-d5); capturing by appending the captured piece to the move (e.g., c5-b6xe5 or c4xa1).\n\n\n"}

Criteria include, but are not limited to:\n\n\nScript coverage is the summary and analysis of a script's plot and writing quality, used by production companies and agencies to track film and TV screenplays. Coverage consists of a number of elements. The first is a 1-to-2-page synopsis of the script’s story highlighting the main characters and events of the tale. The second is a subjective review of the piece (typical length of which could range anywhere from 1 sentence, in short-form contest coverage, to 2 or 3 pages) which assesses the effectiveness of the screenplay’s various components—including its concept, story structure, story development, characters, dialogue, and writing style—and points out its strong points and problem areas. The evaluation ends with a recommendation from the analyst as to what he/she feels the production entity should do with the script. This recommendation usually employs 1 of 3 terms:\n\n• Pass: The reader feels the script fails to make the grade in most areas and that the production entity should not proceed with it.\n\n• Consider: The reader feels the script has a considerable number of strong points and is good enough to proceed with, while acknowledging that it has a number of significant problems that need to be successfully solved before the piece can be considered suitable for production.\n\n• Recommend: The reader feels the script is extremely strong in all respects and that the production entity should proceed with it without reservation.\n\nWhen completed, the synopsis, review, and evaluation are assembled and fronted with a cover page that lists the script’s vital information (author’s name, story genre, time and locations in which it takes place, length of the script, etc.) and contains a brief summary of the story and the review. The cover page usually includes a checklist in which the script’s various aspects are rated on a scale ranging from poor to excellent. Finally, the cover page highlights the analyst’s ultimate recommendation.\n\nAlthough script coverage is a tool used primarily by motion picture production entities, it is sometimes used by screenwriting competitions as a way of separating \"wheat from chaff.\" The coverage done for script competitions is usually simpler than that done for production companies—substituting a logline (a brief 1 or 2 line summary of the story) for the synopsis and simplifying the assessment—often employing only the checklist rating of the script’s various aspects.\n\nIn addition to production entities and screenwriting competitions, a number of independent services employ a roster of veteran script analysts to provide professional-level coverage for screenwriters who wish to see how their scripts will be received by the industry.This gives the writers a chance to identify and resolve problems before submitting them to production entities.\n\nBy the very nature of summarizing a complicated plot, the coverage will not include every plot twist and subplot. Some characters will be omitted, or only briefly introduced for the sake of brevity. In order to decide on what will stay and what will go, the character and actions must support the main plot, and ultimately the premise of the story. Scripts that are not economical and include peripheral characters, scenes, and storylines that do not support character or plot development do not affect their motivation, and therefore can be omitted from the coverage. In this manner, well-written scripts may have longer synopses than poorly written scripts with a lot of extraneous action.\n"}

{"id": "18934997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18934997", "title": "Shared universe", "text": "Shared universe\n\nA shared universe or shared world is a set of creative works where more than one writer (or other artist) independently contributes a work that can stand alone but fits into the joint development of the storyline, characters, or world of the overall project. It is common in genres like science fiction.\n\nIt differs from collaborative writing where multiple artists are working together on the same work and from crossovers where the works and characters are independent except for a single meeting.\n\nThe term \"shared universe\" is also used within comics to reflect the overall milieu created by the comic book publisher in which characters, events, and premises from one product line appear in other product lines in a media franchise.\n\nA specific kind of shared universe that is published across a variety of media (e.g. novels, films, role-playing games, etc.), each of them contributing to the growth, history, and status of the setting is called an \"imaginary entertainment environment.\"\n\nThe term has also been used in a wider, non-literary sense to convey interdisciplinary or social commonality, often in the context of a \"shared universe of discourse\".\n\nFiction in some media, such as most television programs and many comic book titles, is understood to require the contribution of multiple authors and does not by itself create a shared universe and is considered a collaborative art form. Incidental appearances, such as that of d'Artagnan in \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", are considered literary cameo appearances. More substantial interaction between characters from different sources is often marketed as a crossover. While crossovers occur in a shared universe, not all crossovers are intended to merge their settings' back-stories and are instead used for marketing, parody, or to explore \"what-if\" scenarios.\n\nIt can become difficult for writers contributing to a shared universe to maintain consistency and avoid contradicting details in earlier works, especially when a shared universe grows to be very large. The version deemed \"official\" by the author or company controlling the setting is known as canon. Not all shared universes have a controlling entity capable of or interested in determining canonicity, and not all fans agree with these determinations when they occur. A fanon may instead find some degree of consensus within the setting's fandom.\n\nSome writers, in an effort to ensure that a canon can be established and to keep details of the setting believable, employ tools to correct contradictions and errors that result from multiple contributors working over a long period of time. One such tool is retconning, short for \"retroactive continuity\", which resolves errors in continuity that came about through previously-written conflicting material.\n\nReaders may also object when a story or series is integrated into a shared universe, feeling it \"requir[es] one hero's fans to buy other heroes' titles\".\n\nThe expansion of existing material into a shared universe is not restricted to settings licensed from movies and television. For example, Larry Niven opened his Known Space setting to other writers initially because he considered his lack of military experience prevented him from adequately describing the wars between mankind and the Kzinti. The degree to which he has made the setting available for other writers became a topic of controversy, when Elf Sternberg created an erotic short story set in Known Space following an author's note from Niven indicating that \"[i]f you want more Known Space stories, you'll have to write them yourself\". Niven has since clarified that his setting is still to be used only \"under restricted circumstances and with permission\", which Niven granted to the several authors of the Man-Kzin Wars series. By contrast, author Eric Flint has edited and published collaborations with fan fiction writers directly, expanding his 1632 series.\n\nA setting may also be expanded in a similar manner after the death of its creator, although this posthumous expansion does not meet some strict definitions of a shared universe. One such example is August Derleth's development of the Cthulhu Mythos from the writings of H. P. Lovecraft, an approach whose result is considered by some to be \"completely dissimilar\" to Lovecraft's own works. Less controversial posthumous expansions include Ruth Plumly Thompson's and later authors' sequels to L. Frank Baum's \"Oz\" stories and the further development of Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation\" universe by Greg Bear, Gregory Benford, and David Brin.\n\nMany other published works of this nature take the form of a series of short-story anthologies with occasional standalone novels. Examples include Robert Lynn Asprin's Thieves' World, C. J. Cherryh's \"Merovingen Nights\" and Janet Morris' \"Heroes in Hell\".\n\nWithin comics, the term \"shared universe\" has been used to reflect the overall milieu created by the comic book publisher in which characters, events, and premises from one product line appear in other product lines in a media franchise.\n\nBy 1961, Marvel Comics writer and editor Stan Lee, working with artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, merged the bulk of the publisher's comics characters into the Marvel Universe. Marvel sets its stories in an increasing number of alternate realities, each with an assigned number in a greater \"multiverse\". DC Comics and Marvel have also periodically co-published series in which their respective characters meet and interact. These intercompany crossovers have typically been written as self-limiting events that avoid implying that the DC Universe and Marvel Universe co-exist. Exceptions include the twenty-four comics released under the metafictional imprint Amalgam Comics in 1996, depicting a shared universe populated by hybridizations of the two companies' characters. Marvel has since referred to this as part of its setting's greater multiverse by labeling it Earth-692.\n\nAlthough DC and Marvel's shared universe approaches to comics have set them apart from competitors in the industry, other companies have attempted similar models. Valiant Comics and Crossgen both produced titles primarily set from their inception in a single, publisher-wide shared universe, known respectively as Unity and the Sigilverse.\n\nUniverses in films (or television) mostly consist of a franchise featuring an umbrella of multiple franchises (film or television) set within the same continuity, each franchise within telling its own stand-alone story focusing on a different character (or group of characters), as well as featuring its own cast, of directors, writers, while also being part of a coherent, non-contradictory continuity shared with the other works. Fictional universes with major presence in films are referred to as cinematic universes, while fictional universes with major presence in television are refereed to as television universes. Universes with major presence in films and television, generally are refereed as cinematic universes as that's the medium that reaches the most audiences. Some film and television universes are accompanied by video games, and print works such as novels or comics, telling additional canonical stories set within the same continuity.\n\nAn early universe in cinema history was the \"Universal Monsters\" series of \"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"The Invisible Man\" and \"The Wolf Man\", which ran from 1931 to 1951 and featured recurring cast and characters.\n\nSome universes in film have originated as film adaptations of novels, such as the \"James Bond\" film series based on the spy novels by Ian Fleming. The films adapt some elements from the novels, however they are not direct adaptations, additionally they were not adapted in the same order as the books released. The first film in the series is \"Dr. No\" (1962), and has produced 23 sequels, with the most recent one being \"Spectre\" (2015). Due to the series spanning more than 50 years, James Bond has been portrayed by six actors, all the other frequent cast of characters has also gone through replacements, additionally after all Fleming's novels were adapted the series shifted towards original scripts. However, all films are set within a single, coherent fictional continuity, even if the writers, directors and cast change between films. Aspects of the fictional universe are retained between films.\n\nThe \"Planet of the Apes\" film series also originated as a film adaptation of the novel of the same name, taking many creative liberties. The original film titled \"Planet of the Apes\" (1968) focused on present-day astronaut George Taylor landing on a mysterious planet ruled by apes, which is revealed to be a future planet Earth at the end of the film. The sequel \"Beneath\" focused on Brent, an astronaut sent on a rescue mission to save Taylor. The third film \"Escape\" introduced time travel and shifted the focus towards the apes Zira and Cornelius, who appeared as supporting characters in the previous films, as they travel to the past in Taylor's spaceship. The fourth and fifth films, \"Conquest\" and \"Battle\", focus on Zira and Cornelius' son Cesar leading the up-rise against the humans and to the future depicted in the original film. A television series and an animated series are also considered part of the story. The origin of the \"Planet of the Apes\" in the original timeline before the time travel occurred was explained in a prequel-reboot film series with the ape Cesar becoming the main protagonist again, with the story focused on his life from childhood to an old ape, and how the conflict between the apes and the humans, started.\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" film series was created by George Lucas, produced by his self-funded production company Lucasfilm. It originated with the film \"\" (1977), followed by two sequels under the subtitles \"\" (1980) and \"\" (1983); together, those three films are known as the original trilogy and focuses on Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia. The prequel trilogy composed of \"\" (1999), \"\" (2002), and \"\" (2005) expanded the series into a Saga, and focused on Luke Skywalker's father Anakin Skywalker, new cast members portrayed younger versions of characters from the Original trilogy, while other actors returned to their original trilogy roles. On television, the lore was expanded through animation, the animated film titled \"\" (2008) served as the pilot of an (2008-2014). Lucas was deeply creatively involved in the previously mentioned works, but he ceased creative involvement with the \"Star Wars\" franchise in 2014. Lucasfilm announced that from April 2014, only such previously mentioned works would be considered canonical, along all of the fictional works released after such date. The animated series \"Star Wars Rebels\" (2014-2018), was the first work released after. A sequel trilogy formed by \"\" (2015), \"\" (2017) and the upcoming \"\" (2019) featured many returning cast members along newcomers. The films’ main saga is conformed of the original, prequel, and sequel trilogies. A concurrent spin-off film series, known as the anthology films, expands the stories of plot points and characters from the main series. Additionally the series expanded into video games, comics, and novels, telling original stories based on the franchise, classifying it as an imaginary entertainment environment, where the films share the same continuity as all the other media formats, regardless of the different media formats. Lucasfilm's \"Story Group\" coordinates a cohesive story-telling and ensures consistency and synergy by avoiding plot holes between all the film and non-film works. The \"Star Wars Legends\" brand is used to brand all the re-prints of non-canonical works (television films, animated series, video-games, comics, and novels) of the franchise which were produced and/or ceased production before April 2014. Lucas himself considered the \"Legends\" works as non-canonical because considered them to diminish his films meaning by not adhering to his vision. Albeit, Lucas did include a few of the \"Legends\" elements that he supported within his works, such as characters and places which made those included elements canonical. Storytellers after Lucas have also incorporated \"Legends\" elements in their stories, sometimes with the help of the original creators.\n\nAs for comic book based films, there are two cinematic universes based on Marvel Comics characters, both set within a different continuity. The \"X-Men\" film series, which originated in 2000, is the longest-running superhero film franchise to be set within the same continuity. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has the most films, as well as multiple TV shows and a separate run of tie-in comics that co-exist and share the same continuity, making the MCU an imaginary entertainment environment. The DC Extended Universe is a movie franchise that encompasses different movies series based on the DC Comics characters, all of them sharing a continuity.\n\nWriter/director Kevin Smith created a fictional universe used in several of his films, as well as comics and a television series: the View Askewniverse, which is named for Smith's production company, View Askew Productions. The characters Jay and Silent Bob (played by Smith) appear in almost all the View Askewniverse media, and characters from one story often reappear or are referred to in others. Recurring characters, settings, and motifs of the View Askewniverse first appeared in Smith's debut film, Clerks, in 1994.\n\nAmong the most successful novel-to-film adaptations are the film trilogies of \"The Hobbit\" (2012–2014) and \"The Lord of the Rings\" (2001–2003), all of which were directed by Peter Jackson, while serving as faithful adaptations of the novels by J. R. R. Tolkien (especially \"The Lord of the Rings\"). The first work in the series was \"The Hobbit novel\" published in 1937. The novels focused on the hobbits Bilbo Baggins and his nephew Frodo Baggins, as well as the wizard Gandalf, among other species such as dwarves and elves. Videogames taking place between the films of the saga have been produced.\n\nA cinematic universe consisting of films whose titles are the names of songs by Simon and Garfunkel was proposed and publicly discussed by movie creators in 2017. Filmmaker Edgar Wright wrote that the Simon and Garfunkel cinematic universe could begin with his movie \"Baby Driver\" and Marc Webb's \"The Only Living Boy in New York\", and Wright suggested creation of a film named \"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\". Subsequently, other writers, directors, and actors expressed their interest in making films within the universe, such as Rian Johnson: \"Keep the Customer Satisfied\"; Lin-Manuel Miranda: \"Cecilia\"; Marc Webb and Dwayne Johnson: \"I Am a Rock\".\n\nThis refers to universes that are based on television shows without any films. Television series may lead to a spin-off series set in the same universe, often focusing on a single character from the original. The American sitcom \"Cheers\" led to two spin-off series based on its characters, in the form of \"Frasier\" and \"The Tortellis\".\n\nA significant example of shared universes among television shows is the Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis, which suggests that hundreds of American television series take place in the same universe. It builds from the assumption that when an actor playing a character from one series guest-stars in a second series, in character, both of those series must take place in the same universe. The theory takes its name from a character in the final episode of \"St. Elsewhere\", where the common interpretation of the events of that finale is that the entire \"St. Elsewhere\" universe – including all connected series – exist only within Westphall's imagination.\n\nThe spin-off media from \"Doctor Who\", known as the \"Whoniverse\", has relatively little consistency given its division into audio plays produced by Big Finish and the BBC, the New Adventures universe novel, or a universe based on comics published in \"Doctor Who Magazine\" and other publications.\n\nTelevision network The CW houses the Arrowverse, a shared universe of television shows based on characters from DC Comics.\n\nThe Mickey Mouse universe dates back to the 1930s when the animated cartoon was expanded into a newspaper strip. Although the characters occasionally portray other roles and with other names, the writers address this discrepancy by thinking of the characters as being \"employed\" by Disney as actors. Walt Disney, when asked whether or not Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse were married, replied that the mice were indeed married in their \"private li[ves]\", but that they sometimes appeared as boyfriend and girlfriend for \"screen purposes.\" The Mickey Mouse universe also includes the Donald Duck universe as a subset.\n\nThe Pixar universe is an elaborate fan theory suggesting that all Pixar animated movies take place in the same universe. At the 2015 D23 Expo, during the \"Pixar Secrets Revealed\" panel, director Mark Andrews rejected the theory, with \"Inside Out\" co-director Ronnie del Carmen adding \"Do you know what kinds of meetings we'd have to have to make sure all our movies line up?!\"\n\nThe influence of the Internet on collaborative and interactive fiction has also resulted in a large number of amateur shared universe settings. Amateur authors have created shared universes by contributing to mailing lists, story archives and Usenet. One of the earliest of these settings, SFStory, saw its spin-off setting Superguy cited as illustrative of the potential of the Internet. Another example is the furry-themed Tales from the Blind Pig created at the Transformation Story Archive which some limited publication. Other early examples include the Dargon Project, Devilbunnies, and the SCP Foundation..\n\nOne of the lesser known, but still widely popular shared universes is the Whateley Academy stories, a series set in a fictional superhero-themed universe detailing the events occurring at the titular mutant school Whateley Academy. The shared universe of these stories originated in 2004, and has attracted a dedicated fanbase from all over the world.\n\nThe 2000 musical \"Seussical\" presented several works of Dr. Seuss as taking place in the same fictional world.\n\nHasbro toy products including G.I. Joe and Transformers are considered by their manufacturer to exist fictionally within the Hasbro Universe.\n\n\n"}

His 1989 book, \"The Japan That Can Say No\", co-authored with Sony chairman Akio Morita (1991 in English), called on the authors' countrymen to stand up to the United States.\n\nAfter an early career as a writer and film director, he served in the House of Councillors from 1968 to 1972, in the House of Representatives from 1972 to 1995, and as Governor of Tokyo from 1999 to 2012. He resigned from the governorship to briefly co-lead the Sunrise Party, then joined the Japan Restoration Party and returned to the House of Representatives in the 2012 general election. He unsuccessfully sought re-election in the general election of November 2014, and officially left politics the following month.\n\nShintaro Ishihara was born in Suma-ku, Kobe. His father Kiyoshi was an employee, later a general manager, of a shipping company. Shintaro grew up in Zushi, Kanagawa. In 1952, he entered Hitotsubashi University, and he graduated in 1956. Just two months before graduation, Ishihara won the Akutagawa Prize (Japan's most prestigious literary prize) for the novel \"Season of the Sun\". His brother Yujiro played a supporting role in the movie adaptation of the novel (for which Shintaro wrote the screenplay), and the two soon became the center of a youth-oriented cult. Ishihara had dabbled in directing a couple of films starring his brother. Regarding these early years as a filmmaker, he stated to a \"Playboy\" interviewer in 1990 that \"If I had remained a movie director, I can assure you that I would have at least become a better one than Akira Kurosawa\".\n\nIn the early 1960s, he concentrated on writing, including plays, novels, and a musical version of \"Treasure Island\". One of his later novels, \"Lost Country\" (1982), speculated about Japan under the control of the Soviet Union. He also ran a theatre company, and found time to visit the North Pole, race his yacht \"The Contessa\" and cross South America on a motorcycle. He wrote a memoir of his journey, \"Nanbei Odan Ichiman Kiro\".\n\nFrom 1966 to 1967, he covered the Vietnam War at the request of \"Yomiuri Shimbun\". The experience influenced his decision to enter politics.\n\nIn 1968, Ishihara ran as a candidate on the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) national slate for the House of Councillors. He placed first on the LDP list with an unprecedented 3 million votes. After four years in the upper house, Ishihara ran for the House of Representatives representing the second district of Tokyo, and again won election.\n\nIn 1973, he joined with thirty other LDP lawmakers in the anti-communist \"Seirankai\" or \"Blue Storm Group\"; the group gained notoriety for sealing a pledge of unity in their own blood.\n\nIshihara ran for Governor of Tokyo in 1975 but lost to the popular Socialist incumbent Ryokichi Minobe. Minobe was 71 at the time, and Ishihara criticized him as being \"too old\".\n\nIshihara returned to the House of Representatives afterward, and worked his way up the party's internal ladder, serving as Director-General of the Environment Agency under Takeo Fukuda (1976) and Minister of Transport under Noboru Takeshita (1989). During the 1980s, Ishihara was a highly visible and popular LDP figure, but unable to win enough internal support to form a true faction and move up the national political ladder. In 1983 his campaign manager put up stickers throughout Tokyo stating that Ishihara's political opponent was an immigrant from North Korea. Ishihara denied that this was discrimination, saying that the public had a right to know.\n\nIn 1989, shortly after losing a highly contested race for the party presidency, Ishihara came to the attention of the West through his book \"The Japan That Can Say No\", co-authored with Sony chairman Akio Morita. The book called on his fellow countrymen to stand up to the United States.\n\nAccording to politician Kōichi Hamada, Ishihara gave financial and political support to Aum Shinrikyo, a religious cult that was involved in several murders and assassination attempts during the early 1990s. Immediately after the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995, Ishihara dropped out of national politics, suddenly ending a 25-year career in the Diet.\n\nIn the 1999 Tokyo gubernatorial election, he ran on an independent platform and was elected as Governor of Tokyo. Among Ishihara's moves as governor, he:\n\n\nHe won re-election in 2003 with 70.2% of the vote, and re-election in 2007 with 50.52% of the vote. In the 2011 gubernatorial election, his share of the vote dipped to 43.4% against challenges by comedian Hideo Higashikokubaru and entrepreneur Miki Watanabe.\n\nOn October 25, 2012, Ishihara announced he would resign as Governor of Tokyo in order to form a new political party in preparation for upcoming national elections. Following his announcement, the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly approved his resignation on October 31, 2012, officially ending his tenure as Governor of Tokyo for 4,941 days, the second-longest term after Shunichi Suzuki. His deputy Naoki Inose assumed the role of acting governor, and won the subsequent gubernatorial election of 2012.\n\nIshihara's new national party was expected to be formed with members of the right-wing Sunrise Party of Japan, which he had helped to set up in 2010. When announced by co-leaders Ishihara and SPJ chief Takeo Hiranuma on November 13, 2012, Sunrise Party incorporated all five members of SPJ. SP would look to form a coalition with other small parties including Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto's Japan Restoration Party (Nippon Ishin no Kai).\n\nIn November 2012, Ishihara and his co-leader Hiranuma said that the Sunrise Party would pursue \"establishment of an independent Constitution, beefing up of Japan's defense capabilities, and fundamental reform of fiscal management and tax systems to make them more transparent\". The future of nuclear power and the upcoming consumption tax hike were issues it would have to address with potential coalition partners.\n\nOnly four days after the Sunrise Party was launched, on November 17, 2012 Ishihara and Tōru Hashimoto, leader of the Japan Restoration Party (JRP), decided to merge their parties, with Ishihara becoming the head of the JRP. Your Party would not join the party, nor would Genzei Nippon, as the latter party's anti-consumption tax increase policy did not match the JRP's pro-consumption tax policy.\n\nReporting on a poll in early December 2012, \"Asahi Shimbun\" characterized the merger with Japan Restoration Party as the latter having \"swallowed up\" Sunrise. The poll, in advance of the December 16 Lower House elections, also said the association with SP could hurt JRP's chances of forming a ruling coalition even though JRP was showing strength relative to the ruling DPJ.\n\nIn the December 2014 general elections he was a candidate for the Party for Future Generations, but was defeated. Following this, he retired from politics.\n\nIshihara is generally described as one of Japan's most prominent \"far right\" politicians. He was called \"Japan's Le Pen\" on a program broadcast on Australia's ABC. He is affiliated with the openly revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi.\n\nIshihara is a long term friend of the prominent Aquino family in the Philippines. He is credited as being the first person to inform future President Corazon Aquino about the assassination of her husband Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr. on August 21, 1983.\n\nIshihara has often been critical of Japan's foreign policy as being non-assertive. Regarding Japan's relationship with the US, he stated that \"The country I dislike most in terms of US–Japan ties is Japan, because it's a country that can't assert itself.\" As part of the criticism, Ishihara published a book co-authored with then-Prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, titled \"\"No\" to ieru Ajia – tai Oubei e no hōsaku\" in 1994.\n\nIshihara has also long been critical of the Chinese government. He invited the Dalai Lama and the President of the Republic of China Lee Teng-hui to Tokyo.\n\nIshihara is deeply interested in the North Korean abduction issue, and called for economic sanctions against North Korea. Following Ishihara's campaign to bid Tokyo for the 2016 Summer Olympics, he eased his criticism of the Chinese government. He accepted an invitation to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and was selected as a torch-bearer for the Japan leg of the 2008 Olympic Torch Relay.\n\nOn April 9, 2000, in a speech before a Self-Defense Forces group, Ishihara publicly stated that atrocious crimes have been committed repeatedly by illegally entered \"sangokujin\" (Japanese: 三国人 (third country national); a term commonly viewed as derogatory) and foreigners, and speculated that in the event a natural disaster struck the Tokyo area, they would be likely to cause civil disorder. His comment invoked calls for his resignation, demands for an apology and fears among residents of Korean descent in Japan. Regarding this statement, Ishihara later said:\n\nMuch of the criticism of this statement involved the historical significance of the term: \"sangokujin\" historically referred to ethnic Chinese and Koreans, working in Japan, several thousand of whom were killed by mobs of Japanese people following the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923.\n\nOn February 20, 2006, Ishihara also said: \"Roppongi is now virtually a foreign neighborhood. Africans—I don't mean African-Americans—who don't speak English are there doing who knows what. This is leading to new forms of crime such as car theft. We should be letting in people who are intelligent.\n\nOn April 17, 2010, Ishihara said \"many veteran lawmakers in the ruling-coalition parties are naturalized or the offspring of people naturalized in Japan\".\n\nIn 1990, Ishihara said in a \"Playboy\" interview that the Rape of Nanking was a fiction, claiming, \"People say that the Japanese made a holocaust but that is not true. It is a story made up by the Chinese. It has tarnished the image of Japan, but it is a lie.\" He continued to defend this statement in the uproar that ensued. He has also backed the film \"The Truth about Nanjing\", which argues that the Nanking Massacre was propaganda.\n\nIn 2000, Ishihara, one of the eight judges for a literary prize, commented that homosexuality is abnormal, which caused an outrage in the gay community in Japan.\n\nIn a 2001 interview with women's magazine \"Shukan Josei\", Ishihara said that he believed \"old women who live after they have lost their reproductive function are useless and are committing a sin,\" adding that he \"couldn't say this as a politician.\" He was criticized in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly for these comments, but responded that the criticism was driven by \"tyrant… old women.\"\n\nDuring an inauguration of a university building in 2004, Ishihara stated that French is unqualified as an international language because it is \"a language in which nobody can count\", referring to the counting system in French, which is based on units of twenty for numbers from 70 to 99 rather than ten (as is the case in Japanese and English). The statement led to a lawsuit from several language schools in 2005. Ishihara subsequently responded to comments that he did not disrespect French culture by professing his love of French literature on Japanese TV news.\n\nAt a Tokyo IOC press briefing in 2009, Governor Ishihara dismissed a letter sent by environmentalist Paul Coleman regarding the contradiction of his promoting the Tokyo Olympic 2016 bid as 'the greenest ever' while destroying the forested mountain of Minamiyama, the closest 'Satoyama' to the centre of Tokyo, by angrily stating Coleman was 'Just a foreigner, it does not matter'. Then, on continued questioning by investigative journalist Hajime Yokata, he stated 'Minamiyama is a Devil's Mountain that eats children.' Then he went on to explain how unmanaged forests 'eat children' and implied that Yokota, a Japanese national, was betraying his nation by saying 'What nationality are you anyway?' This was recorded on film and turned into a video that was sent around the world as the Save Minamiyama Movement\n\nIn 2010, Ishihara claimed that Korea under Japanese rule was absolutely justified due to historical pressures from Qing Dynasty and Imperial Russia.\n\nIn reference to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Ishihara said \"that the disaster was 'punishment from heaven' because Japanese have become greedy\".\n\nHowever, he also commented that the victims of this disaster were pitiable.\n\nThis speech quickly caused many controversies and critical responses from the public opinion, both inside and outside Japan. The governor of Miyagi expressed displeasure about Ishihara's speech, claimed that Ishihara should have considered about the victims of the disaster. Ishihara then had to apologize about his comments.\n\nDuring the 2012 Summer Olympics, Ishihara stated that \"Westerners practicing judo resembles beasts fighting. Internationalized judo has lost its appeal.\" He added, \"In Brazil they put chocolate in norimaki, but I wouldn't call it sushi. Judo has gone the same way.\"\n\nIshihara has said that Japan ought to have nuclear weapons.\n\nOn April 15, 2012, Ishihara made a speech in Washington, USA, publicly stating his desire for Tokyo to purchase the Senkaku Islands, called the Diaoyu Islands by mainland China, on behalf of Japan in an attempt to end the territorial dispute between China and Japan, causing uproars in Chinese society and increasing tension between the governments of China and Japan.\n\nIshihara is married to Noriko Ishihara and has four sons. Members of the House of Representatives Nobuteru Ishihara and Hirotaka Ishihara are his eldest and third sons; actor and weatherman Yoshizumi Ishihara is his second son. His youngest son, Nobuhiro Ishihara, is a painter. The late actor Yujiro Ishihara was his younger brother.\n\n\n\n\nHe acted in six films, including \"Crazed Fruit\" (1956) and \"The Hole\" (1957), and co-directed the 1962 film \"Love at Twenty\" (with François Truffaut, Marcel Ophüls, Renzo Rossellini and Andrzej Wajda).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "298371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298371", "title": "Shmoo", "text": "Shmoo\n\nThe shmoo (plural: shmoon, also shmoos) is a fictional cartoon creature created by Al Capp (1909–1979); the character first appeared in its classic comic strip \"Li'l Abner\" on August 31, 1948. The popular character has gone on to influence pop culture, language and even science. \nA shmoo is shaped like a plump bowling pin with stubby legs. It has smooth skin, eyebrows and sparse whiskers—but no arms, nose or ears. Its feet are short and round but dextrous, as the shmoo's comic book adventures make clear. It has a rich gamut of facial expressions and often expresses love by exuding hearts over its head. Cartoonist Al Capp ascribed to the shmoo the following curious characteristics:\n\nIn a sequence beginning in late August 1948, Li'l Abner discovers the shmoos when he ventures into the forbidden \"Valley of the Shmoon\" following the mysterious and musical sound they make (from which their name derives). Abner is thrown off a cliff and into the valley below by a primitive \"large gal\" (as he addresses her), whose job is to guard the valley. (This character is never seen again.) There, against the frantic protestations of a naked, heavily bearded old man who shepherds the shmoos, Abner befriends the strange and charming creatures. \"Shmoos\", the old man warns, \"is the greatest menace to hoomanity th' world has evah known!\" \"Thass becuz they is so bad, huh?\" asks Li'l Abner. \"No, \"stupid\"\", answers the man—and then encapsulates one of life's profound paradoxes: \"It's because they's so \"good!!\"\".\n\nHaving discovered their value (\"Wif these around, nobody won't nevah havta work no more!!\"), Abner leads the shmoos out of the valley—where they become a sensation in Dogpatch and, quickly, the rest of the world. Captains of industry such as J. Roaringham Fatback, the \"Pork King\", become alarmed as sales of nearly all products decline, and in a series of images reminiscent of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the \"Shmoo Crisis\" unfolds. On Fatback's orders, a corrupt exterminator orders out \"Shmooicide Squads\" to wipe out the shmoos with a variety of firearms, which is depicted in a macabre and comically graphic sequence, with a tearful Li'l Abner misguidedly saluting the supposed \"authority\" of the extermination squads.\n\nAfter the shmoos have been eliminated, Dogpatch's extortionate grocer Soft-Hearted John is seen cackling as he displays his wares—rotting meat and produce: \"Now them mizzuble starvin' rats has t'come crawlin t'me fo' the necessities o' life!! They complained 'bout mah prices befo'!! Wait'll they see th' new ones!!\". The exterminator congratulates him.\n\nHowever, it is soon discovered that Abner has secretly saved two shmoos, a \"boy\" and a \"girl\". The boy shmoo, as a Dogpatch native, is required to run from the girl shmoo in the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race. (Shmoos are usually portrayed as gender-neutral, although Capp sidesteps this issue to allow the comic plot twist.) When he is caught by her, in accordance with the rules of the race, they are joined in marriage by Marryin' Sam (whom they \"pay\" with a dozen eggs, two pounds of butter and six cupcakes with chocolate frosting—all of which Sam reckons to be worth about 98 cents). The already expanding shmoo family is last seen returning towards the Valley of the Shmoon.\n\nThe sequence, which ended just before Christmas of 1948, was massively popular, both as a commentary on the state of society and a classic allegory of greed and corruption tarnishing all that is good and innocent in the world. The Shmoo caused an unexpected national sensation, and set the stage for a major licensing phenomenon. In their very few subsequent appearances in \"Li'l Abner\", shmoos are also identified by the U.S. military as a major threat to national security.\n\n\"Capp is at his allegorical best in the epics of the Shmoos, and later, the Kigmies\", wrote comic strip historian Jerry Robinson (in \"The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art\", 1974). \"Shmoos are the world's most amiable creatures, supplying all man's needs. Like a fertility myth gone berserk, they reproduced so prodigiously they threatened to wreck the economy\"—if not western civilization as we know it, and ultimately society itself.\n\nAl Capp offered his version of the origin of the Shmoo in a wryly satirical article, \"I Don't Like Shmoos\", in \"Cosmopolitan\" (June 1949):\n\nSuperficially, the Shmoo story concerns a cuddly creature that desires nothing more than to be a boon to mankind. Although initially Capp denied or avoided discussion of any satirical intentions (\"If the Shmoo fits\", he proclaimed, \"wear it!\"), he was widely seen to be stalking bigger game subtextually. The story has social, ethical and philosophical implications that continue to invite analysis to this day. During the remainder of his life, Capp was seldom interviewed without reference to the nature of the Shmoo story.\n\nThe mythic tale ends on a deliberately ironic note. Shmoos are officially declared a menace, and systematically hunted down and slaughtered—because they were deemed \"bad for business\". The much-copied storyline was a parable that was interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the Cold War. Al Capp was even invited to go on a radio show to debate socialist Norman Thomas on the effect of the Shmoo on modern capitalism.\n\n\"After it came out both the left and the right attacked the Shmoo\", according to publisher Denis Kitchen. \"Communists thought he was making fun of socialism and Marxism. The right wing thought he was making fun of capitalism and the American way. Capp caught flak from both sides. For him it was an apolitical morality tale about human nature... I think [the Shmoo] was one of those bursts of genius. He was a genius, there's no question about that.\"\n\nThe Shmoo inspired hundreds of \"Shmoo clubs\" all over North America. College students—who had made Capp's invented idea of the Sadie Hawkins dance a universally adopted tradition—flocked to the Shmoo as well. One school, the University of Bridgeport, even launched the \"American Society for the Advancement of the Shmoo\" in early 1949.\n\nCapp introduced many other allegorical creatures in \"Li'l Abner\" over the years—including Bald Iggles, Kigmies, Nogoodniks, Mimikniks, the Money Ha-Ha, Shminks, Abominable Snow-Hams, Gobbleglops and Bashful Bulganiks, among others. Each one highlighted another disquieting facet of human nature—but none have ever had quite the same cultural impact as the Shmoo. According to publisher Denis Kitchen: \"For the rest of his career Capp got countless letters [from] people begging him to bring the Shmoo back. Periodically he would do it but each time it ended the same way—with the Shmoo being too good for humanity, and he had to essentially exterminate them again. But there was always one or two who would survive for future plot twists...\"\n\nThe actual origin of Capp's word \"shmoo\" has been the subject of debate by linguists for decades, leading to the misconception that the term was derived from \"schmo\" or \"schmooze\". However, \"shmue\" was a taboo Yiddish term for the uterus. It is one of many Yiddish slang variations that would find their way into \"Li'l Abner\". Revealing an important key to the story, Al Capp himself wrote that the Shmoo metaphorically represented the limitless bounty of the earth in all its richness—in essence, Mother Nature herself. In Li'l Abner's words, \"Shmoos \"hain't\" make believe. The hull [whole] earth is one!!\"\n\nThe term \"shmoo\" has entered the English language, defining highly technical concepts in at least four separate fields of science:\n\n\nAn unexpected—and virtually unprecedented—postwar merchandising phenomenon followed Capp's introduction of the Shmoo in \"Li'l Abner\". As in the strip, shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950—including a \"Time\" cover story. They also garnered nearly a full page of coverage (under \"Economics\") in \"Time's\" International section. Major articles also ran in \"Newsweek\", \"Life\", \"The New Republic\" and countless other publications and newspapers. Virtually overnight, as a \"Life\" headline put it, \"The U.S. Becomes Shmoo-Struck!\"\n\nShmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, toys, games, Halloween masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in Baltimore turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel, including \"Shmooveralls\". In 1948, people danced to the Shmoo Rhumba and the Shmoo Polka. The Shmoo briefly entered everyday language through such phrases as \"What's Shmoo?\" and \"Happy Shmoo Year!\"\n\nClose to a hundred licensed shmoo products from 75 different manufacturers were produced in less than a year, some of which sold \"five million units\" each. In a single year, shmoo merchandise generated over $25 million in sales in 1948 dollars (equivalent to $ million in ).\n\nThe Shmoo was so popular it even replaced Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse as the face of the Children's Savings Bond, issued by the U.S. Treasury Department in 1949. The valid document was colorfully illustrated with Capp's character, and promoted by the Federal Government of the United States with a $16 million advertising campaign budget. According to one article at the time, the Shmoo showed \"Thrift, loyalty, trust, duty, truth and common \"cents\" [that] add up to aid to his nation\". Al Capp accompanied President Harry S. Truman at the bond's unveiling ceremony.\n\n\"The Life and Times of the Shmoo\" (1948), a paperback collection of the original sequence, was a bestseller for Simon & Schuster and became the first cartoon book to achieve serious literary attention. Distributed to small town magazine racks, it sold 700,000 copies in its first year of publication alone. It was reviewed coast to coast alongside Dwight Eisenhower's \"Crusade in Europe\" (the other big publication at the time).\n\nThe original book and its sequel, \"The Return of the Shmoo\" (1959), have been collected in print many times since—most recently in 2002—always to high sales figures.\n\nThere was also a separate line of comic books, \"Al Capp's Shmoo Comics\" (featuring Washable Jones), published by the Capp family-owned Toby Press. Comics historian and \"Li'l Abner\" expert Denis Kitchen recently edited a complete collection of all five original \"Shmoo Comics\", from 1949 and 1950. The book was published by Dark Horse Comics in 2008. Kitchen edited a second Shmoo-related volume for Dark Horse in 2011, on the history of the character in newspaper strips, collectibles and memorabilia.\n\nRecordings and published sheet music related to the Shmoo include:\n\n\nShmoos were originally meant to be included in the 1956 Broadway \"Li'l Abner\" musical, employing stage puppetry. The idea was reportedly abandoned in the development stage by the producers, however, for reasons of practicality. A variation of the character had earlier appeared as a marionette puppet on television. \"Shmoozer\", a talking shmoo with an anthropomorphic human body, was a recurring sidekick character on \"Fearless Fosdick\", a short-lived puppet series that aired on NBC-TV in 1952.\n\nAfter Capp's death in 1979, the Shmoo gained its own animated series as part of \"Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo\" (which consisted of reruns of \"The New Fred and Barney Show\" mixed with the Shmoo's own cartoons; the two pairs of characters didn't actually \"meet\"). The characters \"did\" meet, however, in the early 1980s Flintstones spin-off \"The Flintstone Comedy Show\". The Shmoo appeared, incongruously, in the segment \"Bedrock Cops\" as a police officer alongside part-time officers Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble. Needless to add, this Shmoo had little relationship to the \"L'il Abner\" character, other than a superficial appearance. A later Hanna-Barbera venture, \"The New Shmoo\", featured the character as an (inexplicably) shape-shifting mascot of Mighty Mysteries Comics, a group of teens who solve \"Scooby-Doo\"-like mysteries. In this series the Shmoo could magically \"morph\" into any shape at will—like \"Tom Terrific\". None of these revisionist revivals of the venerable character was particularly successful.\n\n\n"}

Digital content is delivered via terrestrial, satellite and cable, as well as over IP.\n\nFree-to-air, free-to-view and subscription providers are available, with differences in the number of channels, capabilities such as the programme guide (EPG), video on demand (VOD), high-definition (HD), interactive television via the red button, and coverage across the UK. The UK's five most watched channels, BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, are available from all providers.\n\nBroadcast television is distributed as radio waves via terrestrial or satellite transmissions, or as electrical or light signals through ground-based cables. In the UK, these use the Digital Video Broadcasting standard. Most TVs sold in the UK come with a DVB-T (terrestrial) tuner for Freeview – a rare thing in Europe. Set-top boxes are generally used to receive channels from other providers. Most services have also integrated their broadcast TV services with additional video streams distributed via the Internet, or through their own Internet Protocol network.\n\nDigital terrestrial television launched in 1998 as a subscription service named ONdigital. Since October 2002, the primary broadcaster is Freeview, which is free of charge to view.\n\nYouView is also distinctly marketed although it provides the same free channels as Freeview as it uses the same transmitter network.\n\nThe TV channels are transmitted in bundles, called multiplexes, and the available channels are dependent on how many multiplexes are transmitted in each area. 3 multiplexes, carrying channels from BBC, ITV, Channel 4, S4C, Channel 5 as well as radio, are available to 98.5% of the population from 1,154 transmitters. A further 3 multiplexes transmit to 90% of homes from 80 transmitters, and another 2 multiplexes are available to 76% of homes from 30 transmitters. The terrestrial service consisting of just the 3 public service multiplexes, available to 8.5% of the population, is informally called 'Freeview Light' by some websites. In Northern Ireland, a multiplex carrying channels from the Republic of Ireland is available to 90% of Northern Irish homes from 3 transmitters. Local TV and radio is available from an additional multiplex at 42 transmitters.\n\nCatch-up TV services such as BBC iPlayer are available via the broadband connection of both Freeview and YouView receivers. On YouView, subscription TV services from BT, TalkTalk, Plusnet, and global streaming services can also be received via the broadband connection. SureTV is a similar service in Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.\n\nThere were many regional companies when cable television services were developed in the late 1980s and 1990s. Today they have amalgamated to become Virgin Media, which is available to 55% of households. Cable TV is a subscription service normally bundled with a phone line and broadband.\n\nWightFibre operates on the Isle of Wight, however acts as a distributor for Sky and YouView instead of having an integrated TV service.\n\nThere are three distinctly marketed direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) services (also known as direct-to-home (DTH), to be distinguished from satellite signals intended for non-consumer reception).\n\nSky TV is a subscription service operated by Sky Ltd, owned by Comcast, which launched in 1998 as SkyDigital. Compared to the previous analogue service, it provided more channels, widescreen, interactive TV and a near video on demand service using staggered start times for pay-per-view content. Innovations since have included high definition, 3d TV, a digital video recorder, the ability to view recordings on other devices, remote operation via the Internet to add recordings, and on demand content via the satellite receiver's broadband connection of both Sky and 3rd party TV. The Sky subscription also includes access to Sky Go, which allows mobile devices and computers to access subscription content via the Internet.\n\nFreesat from Sky, is a free satellite service owned by Sky Ltd. Existing Sky TV customers can end their ongoing subscriptions, and opt for the Free-To-View viewing card, giving them the Freesat from Sky service. Freesat from Sky does not provide digital recording or video on demand. Freesat from Sky has more channels than Freesat, which are mostly international or shopping channels. The on-screen programme guide lists subscription channels even thought they can't be viewed.\n\nFreesat is a free satellite service created jointly by the BBC and ITV. In contrast to Freesat from Sky, it does not need a viewing card. Like Sky, it provides high definition content, digital recording and video on demand via the broadband connection. The on-screen programme guide lists the available channels, rather than encrypted channels which need a subscription to view.\n\nFreesat, Freesat from Sky and Sky TV transmit from SES Astra satellites at 28.2° east (Astra 2E/2F/2G). As the satellites are in geostationary orbit, they are positioned above the earth's equator() approximately 35,786 km above mean sea level; this places them above the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nTV via the Internet can be streamed or downloaded, and consist of amateur or professionally produced content. In the UK, most broadcasters provide catch-up TV services which allow viewing of TV for a window after it was broadcast. Online video can be viewed via mobile devices, computers, TVs equipped with a built in Internet connection, or TVs connected to an external set-top-box, streaming stick or games console. Most of the broadcast TV providers have integrated their set-top-boxes with Internet video to provide a hybrid broadcast and online service.\n\nSince 2006, UK channel owners and content producers have been creating Internet services to access their programmes. Often, these are available for a window after the broadcast schedule. These services generally block users outside of the UK.\n\nThere are numerous online services targeting the UK, offering a combination of subscription, rental and purchase options for viewing online TV. Most are available via any Internet connection, however some require a specific broadband connection. Some services sell 3rd party services, such as Amazon's Prime Video. For brevity, the following table does not include catch-up-only or amateur-only services, individual channels, distributors of illegal or adult content, services which solely redistribute free broadcast channels, or services which don't target the UK. In July 2018 Ofcom statistics showed that the 15.4 million subscribers to commercial online video services exceeded the number of traditional pay TV service subscribers for the first time.\n\nThe Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) measures television ratings in the UK. As of November 2017, the average weekly viewing time per person across all broadcast channels was 24 hours 16 minutes. 12 channels have a share of total viewing time across all channels of ≥ 1.0%.\n\nFor October 2017, there are 9 channel owners with a total viewing share across their channels of ≥ 1.0% (although BARB has separated Viacom channels into two groups, and it's unclear whether STV Group channels are included with ITV plc channels)\n\nThe BBC is the world's oldest and largest broadcaster, and is the country's principal public service broadcaster. The BBC is funded primarily by a television licence and from sales of its programming to overseas markets. It does not carry advertising. The licence fee is levied on all households that watch or record TV as it's being broadcast and the fee is determined by periodic negotiation between the government and the BBC.\n\nIts first analogue terrestrial channel, the BBC Television Service, launched in 1936. It rebranded to BBC 1 in 1964, the same year that BBC 2 launched, the UK's third analogue terrestrial channel after ITV. Both channels styled as BBC One and BBC Two from 1997. BBC News 24 launched as an analogue cable channel in 1997, later rebranding to BBC News. BBC Parliament, which was originally an analogue cable channel known as The Parliamentary Channel, was acquired by the BBC in 1998. From 1998 onwards the BBC started digital TV transmissions, launching new channels and broadcasting via satellite in addition to terrestrial and cable. BBC Three closed as a broadcast channel in 2016, continuing as an Internet video service.\n\nITV is the network of fifteen regional commercial television franchises, founded in 1955 to provide competition to the BBC. ITV was the country's first commercial television provider funded by advertisements, and has been the most popular commercial channel through most of its existence. Through a series of mergers, takeovers and relaxation of regulation, thirteen of these companies are now owned by ITV plc; the other two are owned by STV Group. ITV plc, the operator of all English, Welsh, Southern Scotland and Channel Island franchises, had branded the channel as ITV1 since 2001, with regional names being used prior to regional programmes only since 2002. The ITV name was restored in 2013. ITV plc also operate the Northern Ireland franchise under the UTV brand name. STV Group, which operates the two other Scottish franchises, has now unified the regions under the single name of STV. ITV has been officially known as Channel 3 since 1990, although this is seldom used to identify itself.\n\nITV plc also operates digital channels ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, ITVBe, ITV Encore and CITV, some with HDTV streams. ITN, a subsidiary, currently holds the national news franchise, and ITV Breakfast operates the breakfast franchise.\n\nLaunched in 1982, Channel 4 is a state-owned national broadcaster which is funded by its commercial activities (including advertising). Channel 4 has expanded greatly after gaining greater independence from the IBA, especially in the multi-channel digital world launching E4, Film4, More4, 4Music, 4seven and various timeshift services. Since 2005, it has been a member of the Freeview consortium, and operates one of the six digital terrestrial multiplexes with ITV as Digital 3&4. Since the advent of digital television, Channel 4 is now also broadcast in Wales across all digital platforms. Channel 4 was the first British channel not to carry regional variations for programming, however it does have 6 set advertising regions.\n\nWith Bauer Media Group, Channel 4 jointly owns a range of music channels under the Box Plus Network banner.\n\nChannel 5 was the fifth analogue terrestrial channel to launch, in March 1997. Due to constraints with the available UHF frequencies at the time, many households had to retune their video recorders, which shared the frequency on their RF output with the frequency used by Channel 5's new broadcasts. Channel 5 was the first terrestrial channel to also broadcast via satellite. From 2006 onwards, Channel 5 would launch new digital channels and an Internet on-demand service. After changing ownership several times, in May 2014 Channel 5 and its sister channels would be acquired by Viacom, an American media conglomerate.\n\nBy the time it acquired Channel 5, Viacom already operated a large number of subscription channels in the UK, including the MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central channels, which are available via Sky TV, Virgin Media and NOW TV. In terms of viewing share, the combined viewing across Viacom's free and subscription channels make Viacom the UK's fourth largest broadcaster, after BBC, ITV plc and Channel 4 Corp, according to BARB's viewing figures for January 2018.\n\nOn 18 January 2011, then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Jeremy Hunt announced his intentions to set up a network of local television stations across the UK. The initial plan was to create a network of local television stations, connected through a national backbone. This plan would create a television network similar to that of the network-affiliate model in the United States and Canada. In June 2011, however, it was announced that the national spine plan would be scrapped, and a 'bottom-up' approach would be followed instead, where stations are individually licensed.\n\nRichard Horwood, a former Trinity Mirror executive, announced that when the local television stations are first licensed, he intends to create a television network called Channel 6; this will be a network of local television stations, with Channel 6 supplying the prime time schedule (similar to the American network-affiliate model). Another operator, which has announced its intentions to set up a network of local television stations with a television network connecting them, is City TV Broadcasting. That company says it is basing its operations on the Citytv television system in Canada, but there does not appear to be any official affiliation with the latter's owner, Rogers Communications. City TV is initially bidding on a station to be based in Birmingham.\n\nSky is a European broadcaster owned by global American media conglomerate Comcast. They operate a satellite television service and numerous television channels including Sky One, Sky Two, Sky News, Pick, Challenge, Sky Atlantic, Sky Witness, Real Lives, Sky Arts, Sky Cinema and Sky Sports.\n\nUKTV is a joint venture between the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Studios, and Discovery Inc. Both companies additionally wholly own a number of other channels, broadcast domestically or internationally.\n\nChannels under the joint venture are Alibi, Drama, Dave, Eden, Gold, Good Food, Really, Home, W, Yesterday plus a number of timeshift and high-definition services.\n\nBritish television differs from other countries, such as the United States, in as much that programmes produced in the United Kingdom do not generally have a long 'season' run of around 20 weeks. Instead, they are produced in a series, a set of episodes varying in length, usually aired over a period of a few months. See List of British television series.\n\n100 Greatest British Television Programmes was a list compiled in 2000 by the British Film Institute (BFI), chosen by a poll of industry professionals, to determine what were the greatest British television programmes of any genre ever to have been screened. Although not including any programmes made in 2000 or later, the list is useful as an indication of what were generally regarded as the most successful British programmes of the 20th century. The top 10 programmes are:\n\n100 Greatest TV Moments was a list compiled by Channel 4 in 1999. The top 10 entries are:\n\nIn 2005, the British Film Institute compiled a list of programmes with the biggest audience since 1955. The top 10 are:\n\nThe 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows was a poll conducted by the British television channel Channel 4 in 2001. The top 5 UK-produced programmes are:\n\nThe British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series is one of the major categories of the British Academy Television Awards. The last 5 winners are:\n\nWeekday programming on terrestrial channels begins at 6 am with breakfast national news programmes (along with regional news updates) on BBC One and ITV, with Channel 5. BBC Two also showed children's programming all morning until the start of 2013. That channel now broadcasts repeats of BBC One's daytime programmes. Channel 4 predominately broadcasts comedy and music programmes such as \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" and \"Freshly Squeezed\" in its morning slot. The weekday breakfast news programme ends at 9:15 am on BBC One and 8:30 am on ITV.\n\nFollowing this on BBC One, lifestyle programming is generally shown, including property, auction and home/garden makeover. BBC One continues this genre until after the lunchtime news, whereby afternoon has a soap called \"Doctors\" followed by dramas currently occupy the schedule. BBC Two broadcasts repeats of recent BBC One programmes with on-screen signing before airing news and politics programming between 11 am and 1 pm. ITV on the other hand takes over from GMB at 8:30 am, and generally broadcasts more human-interest chat-style shows, including \"Lorraine\", \"The Jeremy Kyle Show\", \"This Morning\" and \"Loose Women\", in the morning to mid-afternoon slots, with the \"ITV Lunchtime News\" (including a regional bulletin) at 1:30 pm. Channel 4 often shows home-project and archaeology lifestyle programming in the early afternoon after a \"Channel 4 News\" summary. Channel 5 broadcasts chatshow programmes in the morning including \"The Wright Stuff\" with regular news bulletins followed by the last nights \"Big Brother\" (when the show is on air). In the afternoon it shows a drama followed by an hour of Australian soaps such as \"Home and Away\" and \"Neighbours\" and a film.\n\nUntil the end of 2012 BBC One showed children's programmes in the late afternoon but the channel now continues to show lifestyle programming until broadcasting the game show \"Pointless\" at 5:15 pm. BBC Two used to show lifestyle programming such as \"Animal Park\" in the late afternoon before these programmes were switched to BBC One. BBC Two now broadcasts repeats unless it is showing sporting events. ITV shows a lifestyle programme followed by a chat show such as \"The Alan Titchmarsh Show\" before repeats of classic ITV shows, such as \"Heartbeat\", \"Poirot\" and \"Midsomer Murders\" in late-afternoon, before a gameshow-style programme at 5:00 pm, which have included \"Golden Balls\" and \"The Price Is Right\".\n\nNews bulletins are broadcast between 6 pm and 7 pm on both BBC One and ITV, with BBC One beginning with the national BBC News at Six and ITV with the flagship regional news programme. At around 18.30, BBC One broadcasts the regional news programmes whilst ITV broadcasts the ITV Evening News. Channel 4 News starts at 7 pm.\n\nPrimetime programming is usually dominated by further soaps, including \"Doctors\", \"EastEnders\" on BBC One, \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\" on ITV, and \"Hollyoaks\" on Channel 4. These soap operas or 'continuing dramas' as they are now called can vary throughout the year, however weekly dramas, such as \"Holby City\", are also fixed to scheduling. Because of this, the UK can often rely more heavily on TV guides, be it with the newspaper, online, via information services on the television such as the BBC Red Button service or the built in Electronic Programme Guides.\n\nAt 10pm with the flagship national news on BBC One in BBC News at Ten and on ITV on ITV News at Ten followed by the regional late night news\n\nAfter midnight, when late evening films are shown, many channels cease broadcasting \"normal\" programming or simulcast with another channel. Before 2000, the channels simply closed down. However, since then programming has been shown continuously. BBC One will join BBC News in a multichannel simulcast and BBC Two shows a continuous loop of forthcoming programme previews and trailers, although prior to the completion of Digital switchover BBC Two had filled its overnight downtime with Pages from Ceefax. Between 2005 and 2007 ITV broadcast the ITV Play strand of phone-in participation TV programmes but now much of the night is dedicated to the text-based ITV information service ITV Nightscreen. Previously, Channel 4 had closed down to show live feeds of \"Big Brother\" (in the summer) and its spin-off, \"Celebrity Big Brother\" (in January). However, since 2010, repeats of Channel 4 daytime shows have typically been shown. Until the end of the 2000s Channel 5 generally showed various sports from around the world, including boxing and football from European leagues as well as live American sport, with phone-in participation-TV \"Quiz Call\" on weekends. Quiz Call is now shown every night of the week.\n\nWeekend daytime programming traditionally consists of more lifestyle programming, as well as afternoon live and recorded coverage of sporting events and films. There are further battles for viewers in the weekend primetime slot, often featuring reality or talent game shows in the evening. Lunchtime, early evening and late evening news programmes continue on BBC One and ITV although the length of the bulletins are shorter than during the week.\n\nIn 1963 Mary Whitehouse, incensed by the liberalising policies followed by Sir Hugh Greene, then director general of the BBC, began her letter writing campaign. She subsequently launched the Clean Up TV Campaign, and founded the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association in 1965. In 2008, Toby Young in an article for \"The Independent\" wrote: \"On the wider question of whether sex and violence on TV has led to a general moral collapse in society at large, the jury is still out. No one doubts that Western civilization is teetering on the brink ... but it is unfair to lay the blame entirely at the feet of BBC2 and Channel 4.\"\n\nIn 2005, the \"\" elicited 55,000 complaints, and provoked protests from Christian organisation Christian Voice, and a private prosecution against the BBC by the Christian Institute. A summons was not issued.\n\nIn 2007, the General Synod of the Church of England claimed that programmes such as \"Celebrity Big Brother\" and \"Little Britain\" were eroding moral standards. The Synod criticised broadcasting trends that \"exploit the humiliation of human beings for public entertainment\", and called for research to determine the behavioural impact of sexual or violent images.\n\nThe British Academy Television Awards are the most prestigious awards given in the British television industry, analogous to the Emmy Awards in the United States. They have been awarded annually since 1954, and are only open to British programmes. After all the entries have been received, they are voted for online by all eligible members of the Academy. The winner is chosen from the four nominees by a special jury of nine academy members for each award, the members of each jury selected by the Academy's Television Committee.\n\nThe National Television Awards is a British television awards ceremony, sponsored by ITV and initiated in 1995. Although not widely held to be as prestigious as the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards are probably the most prominent ceremony for which the results are voted on by the general public. Unlike the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards allow foreign programmes to be nominated, providing they have been screened on a British channel during the eligible time period.\n\nOfcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the communication industries in the United Kingdom, including television. As the regulatory body for media broadcasts, Ofcom's duties include:\n\nIn 2008, Ofcom issued fines to the total of £7.7m. This included £5.67m of fines to ITV companies, including a £3m fine to LWT over voting irregularities on Saturday Night Takeaway, and fines totalling £495,000 to the BBC. Ofcom said phone-in scandals had contributed significantly to the fine totals.\n\nThe Committee for Advertising Practice (CAP, or BCAP) is the body contracted by Ofcom to create and maintain the codes of practice governing television advertising. The Broadcast Advertising Codes (or the TV codes) are accessible on CAP's web site. The Codes cover advertising standards (the TV Code), guidance notes, scheduling rules, text services (the Teletext Code) and interactive television guidance. The main sections of the TV Code concern compliance, programmes and advertising, unacceptable products, political and controversial issues, misleading advertising, harm and offence, children, medicines, treatments, health claims and nutrition, finance and investments, and religion.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority is an independent body responsible for resolving complaints relating to the advertising industry within the UK. It is not government funded, but funded by a levy on the advertising industry. It ensures compliance with the Codes created by CAP. The ASA covers all forms of advertising, not just television advertisements. The ASA can refer problematic adverts to Ofcom, since the channels carrying the adverts are ultimately responsible for the advertising content, and are answerable to Ofcom. Ofcom can issue fines or revoke broadcast licenses if necessary.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies, a television licence is required to receive any publicly broadcast television service, from any source. This includes the commercial channels, cable and satellite transmissions. The money from the licence fee is used to provide radio, television and Internet content for the BBC, and Welsh-language television programmes for S4C. The BBC gives the following figures for expenditure of licence fee income:\n\n\nAs of 2002, 27,000 hours of original programming are produced year in the UK television industry, excluding news, at a cost of £2.6bn. Ofcom has determined that 56% (£1.5bn) of production is in-house by the channel owners, and the remainder by independent production companies. Ofcom is enforcing a 25% independent production quota for the channel operators, as stipulated in the Broadcasting Act 1990.\n\nITV plc, the company which owns 12 of the 15 regional ITV franchises, has set its production arm ITV Studios a target of producing 75% of the ITV schedule, the maximum allowed by Ofcom. This would be a rise from 54% at present, as part of a strategy to make ITV content-led chiefly to double production revenues to £1.2bn by 2012. ITV Studios currently produces programmes such as \"Coronation Street\", \"Emmerdale\" and \"Heartbeat\".\n\nIn contrast, the BBC has implemented a Window of Creative Competition (WOCC), a 25% proportion over and above the 25% Ofcom quota in which the BBC's in-house production and independent producers can compete. The BBC produces shows such as \"All Creatures Great and Small\" and \"F***off I'm a Hairy Woman\".\n\nChannel 4 commissions all programmes from independent producers.\n\nAs a consequence of the launch of Channel 4 in 1982, and the 25% independent quota from the Broadcasting Act 1990, an independent production sector has grown in the UK. Notable companies include Talkback Thames, Endemol UK, Hat Trick Productions, and Tiger Aspect Productions. A full list can be seen here: \n\nThe following Internet TV services have closed:\n\nThe following services were aborted before launch:\n\nAnalogue TV was transmitted via VHF (1936) and later UHF (1964) radio waves, with analogue broadcasts ending in 2012.\n\nVHF transmissions started in 1936 and closed in 1985 (with a gap 1939–1946), carrying two channels. The launch channel was the BBC Television Service, known as BBC 1 since 1964. This was joined by Independent Television, a network of regional franchises launching between 1955 and 1962. The channels transmitted in monochrome using the 405-line television system at 25 frames per second, initially with an aspect ratio of 5:4, switching to in 1950.\n\nUHF transmissions started in 1964 and closed in 2012. The launch channel was BBC 2. This would be joined by BBC 1, the ITV network, Channel 4 or S4C in Wales, Channel 5 as well as a network of local TV channels. Transmissions started using the System I standard, a 625-line monochrome picture at 25 frames/second (576i) and a 4:3 aspect ratio. Technical advancements included colour (1967), teletext (1974), and stereo sound (1991). The drive to switch viewers from analogue to digital transmissions was a process called the digital switchover.\n\nWhilst there are no longer any analogue broadcasts in the UK, a PAL signal may be present in closed RF distribution systems, e.g. a video feed from an intercom in a block of flats, or a security system.\n\nThere are around 100 defunct British channels. For a list, see List of former TV channels in the UK or .\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was established in 1927 to develop radio broadcasting, and inevitably became involved in TV in 1936. The BBC is funded by income from a \"Broadcast Receiving Licence\" purchased by UK residents. The cost of this is set by agreement with the UK Government.\n\nTelevision caught on in the United Kingdom in 1947, but its expansion was slow. By 1951, with only two transmitters, near London and Birmingham, only 9% of British homes owned a television set. The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to have a regular daily television schedule direct to homes and it was the first to have technical professions to work on TVs. (A. Smith, \"Television: An International History\" 1995)\n\nUp until 1972, television broadcasting hours were tightly regulated by the British government, under the control of the Postmaster General. Before the launch of the commercial channel ITV in 1955, the BBC was restricted by law to just five hours maximum of television in a day. This was increased at the launch of the commercial channel ITV to a 7-hour broadcasting day for both channels. Gradually the number of hours were increased. Typically during the late 1960s the law regulated a 50-hour broadcasting week for all television channels in the UK. This meant BBC One, BBC Two and ITV could only broadcast normal programming for 7 hours a day Mondays to Fridays, and 7.5 hours a day on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nUntil 1957, television in the United Kingdom could not air from 6.00pm-7.00pm. This was called \"Toddler's Truce\", where the idea was that parents could put their children to bed, before prime time television would commence. This restriction was lifted in 1957. However, on Sundays, television remained off the air from 6.00pm-7.00pm. This was in response to religious leaders fears that television would interfere with people attending church services. In 1958 a compromise was reached, where only religious programming could be aired during this time slot. This restriction was lifted in January 1972.\n\nThe Postmaster General allowed exemptions to the regulations. All schools programming, adult education, religious programming, state occasions, political broadcasts and Welsh language programming were totally exempt from the restrictions. Sport and outside broadcasting events were given a separate quota of broadcasting hours which could be used in a year, starting off at 200 hours a year in the mid 1950s, rising to a quota of 350 hours a year by the late 1960s. Broadcasting on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day were also exempt from the tightly controlled restrictions.\n\nThe election of a conservative government in June 1970 brought in changes to the control of broadcasting hours. At first the typical broadcasting day was extended to 8 hours a day, with an increase in exemptions over Christmas and an increase in the sport/outside broadcasting quota. On 19 January 1972, the then Minister for Posts and Telecommunications, Christopher Chataway, announced to the British House of Commons that all restrictions on broadcasting hours on television would be lifted from that day, with the broadcasters allowed to set their own broadcasting hours from then on. By November 1972 a full daytime schedule had been launched on ITV from 9.30am each day, with the BBC also expanding their schedules to include more daytime programming.\n\nThe UK Government previously appointed people to the BBC's Board of Governors, a body responsible for the general direction of the organisation, and appointment of senior executives, but not its day-to-day management. From 2007, the BBC Trust replaced the Board of Governors. It is operationally independent of BBC management and external bodies, and aims to act in the best interests of licence fee payers.\n\nCommercial television was first introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1955. Unlike the US, there was a distinct split between advertisements and programming. Advertisers purely purchased spots within pre-defined breaks within programming, and had no connection to the programme content. The content and nature of adverts being strictly controlled by the ITA the body controlling commercial television.\n\nThe first commercial direct-broadcast satellite (DBS, also known as direct-to-home) service in the United Kingdom, Sky Television, was launched in 1989 and used the newly launched Astra satellite at 19.2° east, providing four analogue TV channels. The channels and subsequent VideoCrypt video encryption system used the existing PAL broadcast standard, unlike the winner of the UK state DBS licence, British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB).\n\nIn 1990, BSB launched, broadcasting five channels (Now, Galaxy, The Movie Channel, The Power Station and The Sports Channel) in D-MAC format and using the EuroCypher video encryption system which was derived from the General Instruments VideoCipher system used in the USA. One of the main selling points of the BSB offering was the Squarial, a flat plate antenna and low-noise block converter (LNB). Sky's system used conventional and cheaper dish and LNB technology.\n\nThe two companies competed over the UK rights to movies. Sky operated from an industrial park in Isleworth in West London, whereas BSB had newly built offices in London (Marco Polo House). The two services subsequently merged to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). BSB's D-MAC/EuroCypher system was gradually replaced with Sky's VideoCrypt video encryption system.\n\nIn 1994 17% of the group was floated on the London Stock Exchange (with ADRs listed on the New York Stock Exchange), and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation owns a 35% stake. \n\nBy 1998, following the launch of several more satellites to Astra's 19.2° east position, the number of channels had increased to around 60 and BSkyB launched the first subscription-based digital television platform in the UK, offering a range of 300 channels broadcast from Astra's new satellite, at 28.2° east position under the brand name Sky Digital. BSkyB's analogue service has now been discontinued, with all customers having been migrated to Sky Digital.\n\nIn May 2008, a free-to-air satellite service from the BBC and ITV was launched under the brand name Freesat, carrying a variety of channels from Astra 28.2°E, including some content in HD formats.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has been adapted into several Takarazuka Revue musicals, as well an anime television series, produced by Tokyo Movie Shinsha and broadcast by the anime television network Animax and Nippon Television. The show remains incredibly popular in Italy.\n\n\"The Rose of Versailles\" focuses on Oscar François de Jarjayes, a girl raised as a man to become her father's successor as leader of the Palace Guards. A brilliant combatant with a strong sense of justice, Oscar is proud of the life she leads, but becomes torn between class loyalty and her desire to help the impoverished as revolution brews among the oppressed lower class. Also important to the story are her conflicting desires to live life as both a militant and a regular woman as well as her relationships with Marie Antoinette, Count Axel von Fersen, and servant and best friend André Grandier.\n\nIt features elements of the yuri genre embodied in the relationship between Oscar and her protégée Rosalie Lamorlière, the secret daughter of the scheming Madame de Polignac. Rosalie refers to Oscar as her first love. Many of the court ladies also greatly adore Oscar, openly admiring her at parties and become very jealous when she brings female companions to them.\n\nThe setting is in France, before and during the French Revolution. In the early part of the series, the main character is the young, flighty Queen of France, Marie Antoinette, however later the focus of the story shifts to a woman named Oscar François de Jarjayes. Oscar's father, General Jarjayes, despaired over never getting a son (he had six daughters), and decided to raise his youngest daughter as a man. He trained her well in the arts of fencing, horsemanship and medieval combat. Oscar often practiced her skills with her best friend, companion and (technically) servant, André Grandier, whom she almost always defeated. André is the grandson of her nanny and thus they spent most of their time together in harmonic friendship; near the end of the story, this friendship blossoms into mutual love.\n\nOscar is the commander of the Royal Guard and responsible for the safety of Marie Antoinette, as well as the rest of the royal family. The story revolves around Oscar's growing realization of how France is governed, and the plight of the poor. Another important storyline is the love story between Marie Antoinette and the Swedish Count Axel von Fersen. The affair between the two is the subject of rumours through all of France, endangering the Queen's reputation and driving Oscar to request the Count to leave the country.\n\nAfter the Count decides to leave and sign up for the American war of independence, Marie Antoinette becomes lovesick. She spends money in excess – expensive jewellery and clothes, attending balls every other night – to distract herself from pining for the only man she loved. This, in turn, weighs on the taxpayers of France, and poverty spreads throughout the country due to Marie Antoinette's squandering of money. Both the Affair of the Diamond Necklace and the appearance of the infamous Gabrielle de Polastron, comtesse de Polignac are central plot events taken from history, as well as the French Revolution and the fall of the Bastille – all given interesting interpretations through the fictional character Oscar and her companions.\n\nOn July 14, 1789, the Taking of the Bastille, the crowds rebel but lack strategy, giving the military the advantage and making themselves easy target for cannon fire. However, Oscar and the regiment B then arrive to help organize the insurgents. During the following fierce battle, Oscar is shot and killed, but the Bastille eventually falls, symbolically striking down the French monarchy. After the Bastille is taken, the revolutionaries burst into the Palace searching for Marie Antoinette and her family. Many guards are killed and the royal family taken prisoner. Big trials are started for Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, but finally, both are declared guilty and guillotined.\n\nIkeda's editors were opposed to her idea of a biography of Marie Antoinette, and only its popularity among readers kept \"The Rose of Versailles\" in publication. Ikeda had read Stefan Zweig's in high school, and the first chapters focus on the queen, casting her as a \"shōjo\" heroine, and Du Barry as a rival. Oscar was created as a supporting character. Oscar eclipsed Marie Antoinette in popularity and due to reader feedback became the main character. Ikeda was influenced by second-wave feminist ideas when creating \"The Rose of Versailles\", using the French Revolution to depict the \"inner revolution of the Japanese women\" at that time.\n\n\"The Rose of Versailles\" is one of the most influential manga ever written. The manga was serialized in Shueisha's Margaret Magazine in 1973, and became an instant success. It was published on 24 May 1982 and contains 10 volumes.\n\nThere is a less-known \"sequel\". It is known as \"Eikou no Napoleon\" or \"The Glory of Napoleon\". It has a few of the original characters and is mostly about the Empire of Napoleon I of France.\n\nIn 1983, the first two volumes of \"The Rose of Versailles\" were translated into English by Frederik L. Schodt for the purpose of teaching English to Japanese speakers and released in North America by the North American branch of Sanyusha. \"The Rose of Versailles\" was the first commercially translated manga to be available in North America. A snippet of the translated manga was also included in Schodt's \"Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics\" book. Udon Entertainment has officially announced the publication rights, with a scheduled release for 2016. As of January 2018, Udon reported that most of the translation was complete and the series was going through editing.\n\nThe \"Versailles no Bara Gaiden\" series is a collections of short stories written by Riyoko Ikeda. These stories were published in two separate magazines in 1974 (first publication) after the serialization of the manga \"The Rose of Versailles\", and 1984–1985 (second publication).\n\nThe gaiden stories were adapted into musicals in 2008–2009.\n\nIn 1979, \"The Rose of Versailles\" was released in Japan as a 40-episode (and 1 recapitulation) animated television series, which ran from October 1979 to September 1980. Besides Japan, the series has also been broadcast in several other countries of Europe and Latin America under the title of \"Lady Oscar\". The anime was directed by Tadao Nagahama (episodes 1-18) and Osamu Dezaki (episodes 19-40), who brought a cinematic approach to the series. Shingo Araki was the animation director and co-character designer along with Akio Sugino and Michi Himeno. Kōji Makaino was in charge of the soundtrack.\n\nThe production staff included the most recognized animation professionals then, who contributed in the making of the 40 episodes of the anime. In spite of the difficulties they had to go through, the staff could continue with their work and took advantage of the problems. The most important of said incidents was the change of direction at the middle of the project, which marked a notable difference between the first half of the anime (directed by Tadao Nagahama) and the second one (directed by Osamu Dezaki).\n\nThe anime was finally aired on October 10, 1979 in Japan on the channel Nippon TV. From this point on, the series would be aired every Wednesday until September 3, 1980, with the airing of the last episode.\n\nThere have been two films based on the \"Rose of Versailles\" series. A third film was in pre-production 2007-2009 at Toei, but later reports claim it has been cancelled.\n\n\"Lady Oscar\" is a 1979 film, written and directed by Jacques Demy, with music composed by Michel Legrand. \"Lady Oscar\" is a French-Japanese co-production, and was shot in France. Frederik L. Schodt translated the entire manga series into English as a reference for the producers of this film, but gave the only copy of the translation to them and it was lost.\n\n\"Inochi Aru Kagiri Aishite\" (\"I'll Love You as Long as I Live\") is a film that summarizes the whole anime. It was released first on video on May 21, 1987 and received a theatrical release on May 19, 1990.\n\n\"Rose of Versailles\" has also been dramatized for Takarazuka Revue by Shinji Ueda. Rose of Versailles has been called Takarazuka's most popular show. The show's role in Takarazuka history is particularly notable as it established the \"Top Star\" system that remains in place to this day. \"Rose of Versailles\" also triggered a large surge in the revue's popularity, commonly referred to as the .\n\nFrom 1974 to 1976, all four Takarazuka troupes staged \"The Rose of Versailles\", drawing a total audience of 1.6 million. In 1989, it was restaged drawing an audience of 2.1 million.\n\nThe most recent shows were the gaiden adaptations performed in mid-to-late 2008 by Snow troupe (led by Natsuki Mizu), Flower Troupe (led by Sei Matobu) and Star Troupe (led by Kei Aran). The scenarios for these new side-story adaptations were developed by Riyoko Ikeda specifically for the Revue.\n\nTo mark the 30th anniversary of the series' beginning, Shueisha released an in 2002, written by Ikeda.\n\nAn official Flash animation parody was released in 2014.\n\nOtomate has announced there will be a screen adaptation and a game adaptation of \"The Rose of Versailles\", both titled \"Shiritsu BeruBara Academy ~Versailles no Bara Re*imagination~\".\n\n\"The Rose of Versailles\" is currently 14th on the list of all-time best-selling shōjo manga, having sold a grand total of 15 million volumes worldwide and 12 million in Japan only, a \"nation-wide best seller\". In terms of circulation per volume, it is in fourth place with an average of 1,500,000 sales per volume. It is not well known in North America (except in Quebec) due to its age and lack of publicity, but remains a treasured classic in Japanese manga. The anime was ranked in the top 50 of a list of favourite anime series in 2005. So far, the manga and anime have been translated into Arabic, Turkish, Korean, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Indonesian and Chinese. The \"immense popularity\" of the 1974 Takarazuka musical gained widespread attention, including academic attention, for not only Rose of Versailles, but for the field of shōjo manga. The research that went into the setting of \"Rose of Versailles\" led some teachers to use it in their classrooms and purchase it for their school libraries, which was a \"Japanese educational first\". The popularity of the manga also created a boom in the study of the French language and made France, particularly Versailles a popular tourist destination for Japanese travellers.\n\nMoto Hagio believes the popularity of \"The Rose of Versailles\" influenced publishers to routinely collect serialized manga in paperback format.\n\nSusan J. Napier has described the court of \"The Rose of Versailles\" as being \"a particularly good example of idealized Western Otherness\". Tierney says that the aesthetics of \"The Rose of Versailles\" cannot be described as purely Japanese or Western. Deborah Shamoon says that \"Rose of Versailles\" can be used to track the development of \"shōjo\" manga from being \"a genre for children to being one for older readers\". The bloody end of the main characters, while shocking, also whet the audience's appetite for more serious stories. Shamoon sees the Oscar-André relationship as very different from the Cinderella-Prince Charming stories which \"dominated\" \"shōjo\" manga in the 1960s, where the female protagonist would lose her identity to her boyfriend. Shamoon considers that the Oscar-André relationship follows the pattern of pre-war \"dōseiai\" \"shōjo\" novels, which featured same-sex love between girls. Kazuko Suzuki says that after \"RoV\", \"several works\" were created with \"nonsexual\" female protagonists like Oscar, who realize their \"womanness\" upon falling in love.\n\n\"The Rose of Versailles\" is famous for having the first \"bed scene\" in manga that was depicted by a woman, which has had a \"profound impact\" on female readers, including fan criticism of the adaptation of this scene to the anime. Yukari Fujimoto has said that \"for us junior and senior high school girls at that time, our concept of sex was fixed by that manga\".\n\nThe series is generally cited as having been a major influence on \"Revolutionary Girl Utena\" and \"Le Chevalier D'Eon\". Oscar makes a crossover appearance in the \"Lupin III\" \"Part II\" anime series episode \"Versailles Burned with Love\", and the series is mentioned as a frame of reference for the Rose Knights in the light novel series \"Gate: Jieitai Kano Chi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39078456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39078456", "title": "The Undertaker vs. Mankind", "text": "The Undertaker vs. Mankind\n\nThe Undertaker vs. Mankind was a professional wrestling match between The Undertaker and Mankind, also known as Mick Foley, of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and the third held inside the Hell in a Cell structure (two weeks following the second, which took place on the June 15 episode of \"Raw is War\" to promote the pay-per-view's dual main-event). The match took place at the King of the Ring pay-per-view on June 28, 1998, at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It would set the standard for future Hell in a Cell matches. During the bout, Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential bumps. Journalist Michael Landsberg called it \"maybe the most famous match ever.\"\n\nUpon debuting with the WWF in 1996, Mankind immediately began feuding with The Undertaker, debuting the night after WrestleMania XII when Mankind interfered in The Undertaker's match with Justin Hawk Bradshaw. For the next few months, Mankind ambushed and cost The Undertaker several matches. The feud intensified, and they began taking their battles into crowds, backstage areas, and in the boiler rooms of different arenas. Mankind cost the Undertaker the WWF Intercontinental Championship at , assisting champion Goldust to victory. As a result, the first ever Boiler Room Brawl was booked between the two at SummerSlam. During the match, when Undertaker reached for Paul Bearer's urn, Bearer hit him with it, betraying The Undertaker and allowing Mankind to \"incapacitate\" The Undertaker with the Mandible claw, giving him the win. After Bearer's betrayal, The Undertaker took his rivalry with Mankind to a new level, resulting in a Buried Alive match in the main event of . The Undertaker won the match after a chokeslam into the open grave, but after interference from The Executioner, as well as the help of several other superstars, The Undertaker was ultimately \"buried alive\".\n\nAfter being buried alive, The Undertaker returned at the Survivor Series again pitting him against Mankind, but with a unique stipulation; hanging above the ring was Paul Bearer, enclosed in a steel cage. If Undertaker won the match, he would be able to get his hands on Bearer. Even though The Undertaker won the match, interference from The Executioner enabled Bearer to escape The Undertaker's clutches. With no manager, Undertaker developed a more humanized incarnation, with a different, gothic and rebelling attitude — perhaps to better fit him to The Attitude Era, a more adult-oriented programming content period of World Wrestling Federation —, proclaiming himself to be \"The Lord of Darkness\". After The Undertaker attended to other feuds and won the WWF Championship at WrestleMania 13, the feud with Mankind temporarily ended after one more match at , won by The Undertaker.\n\nIn the following year, The Undertaker would either hold the WWF Championship or be in contention for it while Foley would gradually bring out his \"Three Faces of Foley\": Mankind, Dude Love, and his old gimmick from World Championship Wrestling & Extreme Championship Wrestling, Cactus Jack.\n\nOn the June 1, 1998, edition of \"WWF Raw is War\", Foley would revert to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked shirt with a loose necktie and restarted the feud with The Undertaker. Mankind reunited with Paul Bearer, the father and manager of Kane, and the new alliance challenged Undertaker and WWF champion Stone Cold Steve Austin to the second Hell in a Cell match on the June 15 episode of Raw. That bout ended in a no-contest, with Undertaker attacking Bearer in a locked cell while Austin assaulted Kane atop the structure. This set up the double main-event for King of the Ring; Austin and Kane in a First Blood match for the title, while Undertaker and Mankind would then be booked for a one-on-one inside Hell in a Cell.\n\nBefore this match, Foley and Terry Funk were discussing the previous year's Hell in a Cell at that featured the Undertaker backdropping and slamming Shawn Michaels onto the chain-link ceiling of the cage. Foley and Funk were brainstorming ideas about how to top that match when Funk said, \"laughing, 'maybe you should let him throw you off the top of the cage.'\" Foley:\n\nWhen presented with the idea of throwing Foley off the top of the cage, Undertaker was a little more hesitant, even going as far as to ask Foley, \"Mick, do you want to die?\" Ultimately, Undertaker reluctantly agreed to perform the spot. Fittingly for Foley, the King of the Ring was scheduled to take place that year at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh. Foley himself trained to become a professional wrestler at Dominic DeNucci's wrestling school in nearby Freedom, Pennsylvania, only from Pittsburgh, bringing his career full circle.\n\nFoley came out first and once he reached the cell, he threw a chair on top of the structure and began to climb up to the top. The Undertaker then made his way to the ring, saw Foley on top of the cell, and also climbed to the top. Both wrestlers then began to fight on the roof of the cell.\n\nThe first bump Foley would take came as both wrestlers were brawling on top of the cell, and the Undertaker threw Mankind from the top of the structure from a height of , if including the angle of the fall, and sent him crashing through the Spanish announcers' table, which triggered announcer Jim Ross to famously shout, \"Good God almighty! Good God almighty! That killed him!\" and \"As God as my witness, he is broken in half!\"\n\nFoley remained motionless underneath debris, while the Undertaker remained on top of the cell staring down. Foley's longtime friend Terry Funk was the first person on the scene, followed by WWF's resident doctor, Dr. Francois Pettit, and various others, including Vince McMahon, who broke character by looking legitimately worried about someone (Foley) that, on-air at least, he was supposed to dislike. Foley was placed on a stretcher and began to be wheeled out of the arena.\n\nMoments later, there was commotion on the entrance ramp as Foley got up from the stretcher and proceeded to make his way back to the cell, climbing to the top of the structure, with the Undertaker doing likewise (this time they both climbed the cell surprisingly quickly despite Foley having suffered a dislocated shoulder due to the fall, and the Undertaker wrestling with a broken foot that night). With both men back on the top of the cell the match resumed.\n\nEarlier as both were walking on the chain-link mesh which comprised the cell's ceiling, the metal fasteners were snapping off causing the roof to sag and partially give way under their combined weight. According to Terry Funk, the prop guy had purposely designed it that way, except it was never meant to give way completely. In the second huge bump of the night, the Undertaker chokeslammed Mankind atop the chain-link mesh cage, causing one panel to give way completely, resulting in Foley falling through and hitting the ring canvas hard below. In response, announcer Jim Ross shouted, \"Good God...Good God! Will somebody stop the damn match? Enough's enough!\"; along with color commentator Jerry Lawler adding, \"That's it. He's dead.\"\n\nThe cage giving way completely was a surprise to both Foley and the Undertaker. The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall, yet he was able to stay in character. Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around. Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, \"Watching from the back, I thought he was dead. I ran out here and looked down at him, still lying in the ring where he'd landed. His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, like a dead fish's eyes.\" Foley later said that the only reason he survived the fall was because he did not take the chokeslam properly. In his memoir \"\", Foley called it both the best and worst chokeslam he ever took, saying that despite its looks, he would have likely died if he had landed properly. He also cited the fact that the ring onto which he landed had a harder surface than that of modern rings, which stopped his momentum once he landed. Foley would later explain that the roof of the cell was supposed to sag sufficiently so that Undertaker could kick him through, allowing him to dangle by his feet and eventually fall in a rotation to land on his front. Years later, The Undertaker would note that just before executing the chokeslam, he had been standing with his left foot on the same panel that Foley fell through, but at the last second decided to instead place it on the support bar the panel was attached to so that he would have more stability for lifting Foley; had he not done that, he would have fallen through and probably landed at least partially on Foley, thus potentially injuring Foley (and himself) far worse. <ref>\n"}

{"id": "233793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=233793", "title": "Water slide", "text": "Water slide\n\nA water slide (also referred to as a flume, or water chute) is a type of slide designed for warm-weather or indoor recreational use at water parks. Water slides differ in their riding method and therefore size. Some slides require riders to sit directly on the slide, or on a raft or tube designed to be used with the slide.\n\nA typical water slide uses a pump system to pump water to the top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface. The water reduces friction so sliders travel down the slide very quickly. Water slides run into a swimming pool (often called a plunge pool) or a long run-out chute. A lifeguard is usually stationed at the top and the bottom of the slide, so that if a rider gets hurt they will be treated immediately.\n\nAs the name suggests, body slides feature no mat and require the person to sit directly on the surface of the slide. There are a variety of types of body slides including simple flumes, speed slides, bowls and AquaLoops - the latter three are explained below.\n\nSome slides are designed to be ridden with a tube which typically seats either 2 or 3 riders inline. Similar to a traditional body slide, these slides include many twists and turns and come in a variety of types including bowls, funnels and half-pipes.\n\nThe world's longest water slide was a temporary installation in Waimauku, New Zealand, in February 2013. Constructed with a length of , of which functioned properly. Its creators claimed the previous record holder had a length of ~. The slide is being moved to Action Park in Vernon, New Jersey\n\nThe \"Waterslide\" at Buena Vista Lodge in Costa Rica is a long water slide where the rider sits directly on the slide, with an inner-tube around their upper body for safety.\n\nThe longest multi-person water-coaster (see below) is the long Mammoth at Holiday World in Santa Claus, Indiana.\n\nThe first known existence of a looping water slide was at Action Park in Vernon Township, New Jersey in the mid-1980s. The park's water slide featured a vertical loop but was repeatedly closed due to safety concerns. In the late 2000s, Austrian manufacturer \"Aquarena\" developed the world's first safe looping water slide, known as the \"AquaLoop\". The company engineered a slide with an inclined loop rather than a standard vertical one. The slide is currently licensed and distributed by Canadian water slide manufacturer \"WhiteWater West\". There are nearly 20 AquaLoop installations around the world. The first installation was in Slovenia in 2008. The largest collection is located at Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast in Australia which houses 4 AquaLoops that opened in 2010. Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast was also the first to install more than one AquaLoop at a single location. The AquaLoop uses a trap-door to release riders down a near-vertical descent at a speed of up to . Riders experience 2.5 Gs in less than 2 seconds. The whole ride is over within 7 seconds.\nA \"bowl\" is a type of water slide where riders descend a steep drop into a round bowl. Under the effects of centrifugal force, the riders circle the outer area of the bowl before exiting down through the middle, often into a pool underneath but sometimes into an additional slide section. This style of water slide comes in various styles and is manufactured by ProSlide, WhiteWater West and Waterfun Products. The different variations can be ridden on a 4-person cloverleaf tube, 2 person inline tube, single person tube or as a body slide.\n\"Family rafting\" water slides have the largest capacity of all the different types of tubing water slides averaging between 4 and 6 riders per dispatch. Riders hop in a circular raft and travel down long, twisted channels to the ground. This type of water slide is manufactured by Australian Waterslides and Leisure, ProSlide, Waterfun Products and WhiteWater West. All of these companies manufacture open-air slides while ProSlide also manufactures an enclosed version.\nA \"funnel\" water slide requires riders to sit in a 2 or 4 seater round tube. Riders drop from inside a tunnel out into the ride's main element shaped like a funnel on its side. Riders oscillate from one side to the other until they exit through the back of the funnel and into a splash pool. The most common type of funnel is the ProSlide Tornado which is installed at almost 60 locations around the world dating back to 2003. In 2010, WhiteWater West began developing a competing product known as the Abyss, utilizing a raft that holds up to six riders.\n\nSimilar to a funnel, a \"half-pipe\" features a slide in which riders oscillate back and forth. However, this style of ride does not feature any enclosed sections. On a Waterfun Product Sidewinder or Sidewinder Mini, riders oscillate several times before coming to a rest at the base of the slide. Riders then need to walk off the slide returning their tube to the next riders. On a WhiteWater West Boomerango or Family Boomerango, riders are sent down a steep drop and up a steep hill on the other side, before sliding backwards down another path to the end of the slide.\nA \"multi-lane racer\" is a ride where between 4 and 8 riders dive head-first onto a mat and down a slide with several dips. As an additional component of this ride, both some offer an additional enclosed helix at the top of the ride. ProSlide offer ProRacers, Octopus Racers and Kraken Racers, while WhiteWater West have designed the Mat Racers and Whizzards. Australian Waterslides and Leisure have also manufactured a standard multi-lane racer.\nA \"speed slide\" is a type of body slide where riders are sent down steep, free-fall plunges to the ground. Almost all water slide manufacturers offer a variation of this type of slide. ProSlide & WhiteWater West both offer a speed slide with a trap door, the same trap door found on the AquaLoop.\nA \"water coaster\" is a water slide that mimics a roller coaster by providing not only descents, but ascents as well. There are three different ways water coasters operate: water jets, conveyor belts, and linear induction motors. High powered water jets power the first type of water coaster, generically known as Master Blasters. Originally manufactured by New Braunfels General Store (NBGS), the rights were sold in December 2006 to WhiteWater West of Canada. The first installations of this type of ride were Dragon Blaster and Family Blaster installed in 1994 at Schlitterbahn in New Braunfels, Texas. The following month a third Master Blaster opened at Adventure Bay in Houston, Texas. This type of ride features over 70 installations worldwide. The largest collection of Master Blasters is at Wild Wadi Water Park in Dubai where 9 of the park's 16 water slides utilize this technology to power riders to the top of a mountain. The first conveyor belt was installed at Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, Ohio. Known as the Zip Coaster, the ride powers riders up hills using high speed conveyor belts. The third incarnation of the water coaster utilizes linear induction motors and specially designed rafts. The first installation to use this technology was Deluge which opened in 2006 at what was then Splash Kingdom at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom. The longest water coaster utilizing this magnetic system is Mammoth at Splashin' Safari in Santa Claus, Indiana. This technology has been adapted to other ProSlide products and is collectively known as the ProSlide HydroMAGNETIC. In 2010, ProSlide announced that they would be combining the family rafting and water coaster technologies to create a Hydromagnetic Mammoth. The first installation of this variation is aptly titled Mammoth which premiered in 2012 at Splashin' Safari in Indiana. It replaced the park's own Wildebeest as the longest water coaster in the world.\n\nA \"drop\" slide is a type of body slide where at the end of the slide, riders fall multiple feet into the water, as opposed to exiting into the water.\n\nInflatable water slides are designed for the home user. They are typically made of a thick strong PVC or vinyl and nylon, and are inflated using an electric or gasoline powered blower. The water slide is attached to a water hose in order to generate the supply of water. There are small sized inflatable water slides for private house uses or larger inflatable water slides for school, picnic, corporate, or carnival style use. There are also swimming pool water slides which users can set up to slide straight into a pool. Most parks avoid this due to safety concerns, and will have swimming sections in a separate pool.\n\n\n"}
