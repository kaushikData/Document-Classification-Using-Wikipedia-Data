{"id": "50841368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50841368", "title": "Absolver", "text": "Absolver\n\nAbsolver is a martial arts-themed action role-playing video game developed by Sloclap and published by Devolver Digital for PlayStation 4 and Windows. In the game, players control warrior characters who fight other players and computer-controlled characters across the fictional land of Adal to prove their worthiness of joining the Absolver peacekeepers. The game's story is focused on the human development of the characters as they fight to find their place in the collapsed empire. The character's fighting moves are customized in a \"combat deck\" of cards, with each card assigned to a move. Players earn cards, equipment, and weapons by progressing through the game.\n\nSloclap, a Parisian indie game developer composed of former Ubisoft Paris employees, began work on \"Absolver\" in May 2015. Their core game concept was to have fluid, dynamic movement, similar to dance. The game debuted a year later at the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo and was released in August 2017.\n\n\"Absolver\" is an action role-playing game based on martial arts fighting, featuring a seamless open world with shortcuts and free-roaming, and merging single, cooperative and competitive play in the same campaign, which is played from a third-person perspective. Players build custom combinations of strikes, parries, and feints to fight other players and computer-controlled characters. Players control warrior characters known as Prospects who travel the fictional land of Adal to fight other players and prove their worth to become one of the Absolver peacekeepers. Players progress through the game to unlock new armor and equipment, combat styles, and weapons, usually as \"loot\" dropped by defeated enemies. The game has minor massively multiplayer online game elements, including the feature of fighting alongside other players on quests and of directly fighting other players in player versus player match-ups. Players can also spar with others to teach their characters skills.\n\nPlayers customize their characters' fighting movesknown as a move setby adding and removing cards in a \"combat deck\", with each card assigned to a specific move. Additionally, players switch between four fighting stances during combat, which changes the moves available to the player. Each fighting stance has two attacks, each with its own controller button. Players earn additional cards by progressing through the game. Each card has a numerical rating for speed and damage dealt as well as secondary functions, such as the ability to break an opponent's guard. The moves in each stance can be set such that the player can switch between stances during a single combination of attacks to have the guard-breaking or absorption-interrupting moves that work best against the opponent's play style. The character can also equip a weapon, but its benefits and drawbacks are balanced: weapons are powerful but slower than skillful hand-to-hand attacks. Players can also disarm other players to take their weapons.\n\nSloclap, a Parisian indie game studio composed of former Ubisoft Paris employees, began to develop its first game in May 2015. The team had previously worked on games including \"Watch Dogs\" and the \"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon\" series. They began with the idea that combat should be \"fluid\" and \"dynamic\", like a personal choreography. Sloclap expressed this core concept through three internal taglines in their development: \"combat is a dance\", \"movement is your weapon\", and \"make a move\". Pierre Tarno, the game's creative director, liked how players could experiment with the combat deck to find a set that works best for them. Sloclap plans to closely monitor the game balance issues of creating overpowered move sets during online play, and plan to monitor this with playtesting. \"Absolver\" is built in the Unreal Engine 4 game engine. \"Absolver\" was first announced on May 26, 2016, and debuted at the June 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo with Devolver Digital as its publisher. The game was released on August 29, 2017, for PlayStation 4 and Windows platforms.\n\nCritics who previewed the game compared its gameplay to that of \"Dark Souls\" and \"Street Fighter\". In particular, Sam Prell (\"GamesRadar\") found the \"Souls\" games and \"Absolver\" to share difficult melee fights that emphasize stamina management, and seamless multiplayer that adds both allies and enemies. Critics also noted how the game's simple controls quickly became complex, credited in particular to the game's combat deck concept. Kris Graft (\"Gamasutra\") wrote that the fighting game was \"a promising start\" and one of the most interesting he has played. \"Absolver\" unexpectedly astonished Griffin McElroy (\"Polygon\")it was his \"biggest surprise\" of the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Sam Prell (\"GamesRadar\") was also surprised by the depth of the combat system, and Andrew Tarantola (\"Engadget\") noted the game's deviance from the traditional massively multiplayer online game for its lack of guns, and Brad Borque (\"Digital Trends\") added that \"Absolver\" was quiet compared to other battle-focused games. Borque also complimented \"Absolver\" palette and thought of its art style as a welcome break from the hyperrealism of recent games. Games journalists listed the game among the best in show at the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo where its other accolades included \"GamesRadar\" \"Best Indie Game of E3\" and \"GamesBeat\" \"Killer App Killer\" for \"compelling and/or intuitive gameplay\" in an Unreal Engine game.\n\n\"Absolver\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews for the PS4 version of the game, while the PC version received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nThe game was nominated for \"Best Action Game\" at \"PC Gamer\"s 2017 Game of the Year Awards, and for \"Best Fighting Game\" in \"IGN\"s Best of 2017 Awards.\n"}

It is the sequel to the popular 2005 game \"Another Century's Episode\". It was released for the PlayStation 2 on March 30, 2006.\n\nOn November 29, 2007, Banpresto released \"A.C.E. 2 Special Vocal Edition\" as a follow-up to the heels of \"A.C.E. 2\"'s sequel, \"\". This version includes vocal theme songs for each of the featured animated series in the game.\n\nA.C.E.2 is not a direct sequel to its predecessor, as it involves its own original plot, as well as covering events that already happened in \"A.C.E.\", albeit differently. This is not an unusual occurrence, as Banpresto has done this with most entries in the \"Super Robot Wars\" franchise; most of the games in that series are not connected by an established continuity (exceptions include the \"Super Robot Wars Alpha\" games and the titles in the \"Super Robot Wars\" classic timeline), with remakes or updates abounding.\n\nHowever, there are some links back to \"A.C.E.\" in the sequel. The \"Ark\" series, including the main character's Gunark, use as their power source the super-volatile substance E2, which was introduced in the first game. Additionally, most of the \"A.C.E.\" original enemies return, this time with a backstory, while in A.C.E. they were simply there to add to the challenge.\n\n\nLike the previous game in the series, \"A.C.E. 2\" features two different set-ups for the controller: shift and select type. However, unlike \"A.C.E.\", neither of these set-ups will be a \"simple mode\" for first-time players. Instead, the two different set-ups will simply represent different ways of using the many weapons available to the player.\n\nThe player can also choose to modify the controls for plane-type units, such as the Re-GZ, the Valkyrie's Fighter Mode and the transformations of machines like Layzner MK II and L-Gaim MK II. Flight Mode is the standard control system, where the player controls roll and pitch with the Left Analogue Stick, and can bank with the L1 and R1 buttons. Easy Mode has the analogue stick control both roll and pitch. Flight Reverse Mode reverses the natural set-up for altitude, so that tilting the analogue Stick down causes the machine to dive, while holding it up makes the machine climb.\n\nSix of the series from \"A.C.E.\" return in \"A.C.E. 2\", joined by five new ones (although one of the new series, \"Endless Waltz\", is the sequel to one of the series that did not return from \"A.C.E.\" and \"Gundam Wing\"). Additionally, three EX Series are included, although their involvement in the game's story is not as significant as the other series (excluding \"Wings of Rean\", which is announced to join the series in later promotion video, and have its ONA released after the game). A grand total of 106 playable mecha from the fourteen anime represented, as well as the originals, are playable.\n\nIn addition to the fourteen series, \"A.C.E. 2\" includes new original characters and mecha, designed by Takuya Saito and Junya Ishigaki, respectively. The heroes of the game are Tak Kepford (voiced by Daisuke Kishio) and Marina Carson (voiced by Naomi Shindou), and they pilot transforming mecha called \"Gun Arks\".\n\nThe game's opening theme is \"Glorious\" by Rina Aiuchi; its ending theme, also performed by Aiuchi, is \"Precious Place\".\n\n\"A.C.E. 2\" follows the musical style of its predecessor, using remixes of themes from the featured anime along with several new songs composed for the game. However, \"A.C.E. 2\" uses much more faithful remixes of the songs borrowed from anime, while \"A.C.E.\" used more rock and roll-styled remixes.\n\nThe theme songs for each series are:\n\nThe August 2007 issue of Famitsu announced a special vocal version of \"A.C.E. 2\", which will be released on November 29, 2007. Like its sequel, \"A.C.E. 3\", the theme songs of each respective series will be replaced by their original vocal themes.\n\n\n"}

The double act are known for their comically dark performing style, for taking as inspiration the accounts of Biblical miracles and faking paranormal phenomena to form the basis for some of their illusions.\n\nJones was born on 16 April 1982 in Aberdeen and grew up in Portlethen, Scotland. MacLeod was born on 4 July 1980 in Aberdeen and grew up in Peterhead, Scotland. MacLeod attended Peterhead Academy before studying philosophy and psychology at Aberdeen University, while Jones grew up in Old Portlethen, before moving to London to study multimedia computing.\n\nThey met in Aberdeen in 1994 and started making videos of themselves performing magic. This is where their double act style of acting out scenes in character while performing illusions developed. The filmed results of these magic sketches eventually reached a television production company and led to the making of their first TV series \"Magick\". The show was nominated as Best Comedy Series at the Rose d'Or international television awards in Montreux in 2004.\n\nIn 2005 they hosted the television series \"Dirty Tricks\" and television special \"When Magic Tricks go Wrong\" and in 2006 the pair created two one-hour specials for Channel 4, \"Tricks from the Bible\" and \"The Magic of Jesus\" where they took inspiration from and duplicated the miracles described in the Old and New Testament.\n\nIn 2009, Jones and MacLeod were awarded the 'Best Comedy Illusionist' Award at the World Magic Awards.\n\nThey have toured the UK extensively throughout from 2010 with their live shows as well as performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with new shows between 2008 and 2011.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012 they were part of both seasons of BBC1's \"The Magicians\", a live magic show drawing in over 6 million viewers weekly. They most recently made \"The Happenings\" – four one-hour specials for Watch in which the duo use their magic to fake paranormal events.\n\nJones and MacLeod's first television series \"Magick\" (aka \"Sick Ticks\" also, \"Crack Magick\") debuted on 5 October 2003 and was described as \"comedy magic featuring surreal characters in bizarre and uncomfortable situations.\" It began airing in Australia on SBS on 1 February 2007 under the title \"Sick Tricks\".\n\nThis series featured reverse film magic, where the magic was performed backwards and the film later reversed to reveal the backmasking.\n\nIn one of a series of ‘crimes’ caught on CCTV, footage captures two men being caught en flagrante in a public toilet by a police officer. To get out of trouble, one of the men hides the other behind his coat and makes him disappear. In another incident, a man breaks into a car by sticking his hand through a glass window without breaking it.\n\nSecret filming in a supermarket captures MacLeod and Jones magically sabotaging the products by putting dead insects into sealed bottles of mineral water and penetrating razor blades through the foil lids of ready-meals.\n\nIn 2004 this four-part series was nominated for a Rose D'Or comedy award in Montreux.\n\n\"Dirty Tricks\" was a six-part series hosted by Jones and MacLeod. It was described as \"magic meets Natural Born Killers.\" The show also had regular spots from Pete Firman, Ali Cook and Jonathan Goodwin as well as guest appearances from international variety acts and celebrities including Penn & Teller and Kevin James.\n\nAt the end of every show, the presenters \"killed\" the radio and TV presenter Neil Fox in a horrific and painful manner. These included him being cremated, stabbed and crushed.\n\nThis one-hour special aired over the Christmas holiday period in December 2005. In this show Jones and MacLeod drew inspiration from the accounts of Jesus' miracles in the New Testament to present illusions which included apparently walking on the surface of water in a glass tank, turning water into wine, causing a blind person to temporarily 'see', appearing to raise a deceased person, causing a virgin to apparently become 'pregnant' and feeding 5000 people.\n\nThe show caused controversy among newspapers and other press, with John Beyer of Mediawatch describing it as \"a calculated attempt to cause offence\".\n\nFollowing on from \"The Magic of Jesus\" this one-hour special aired in June 2006. The duo drew inspiration from the miracle accounts in the Old Testament. Jones and MacLeod performed illusions such as turning staffs into snakes in Egypt, exactly where it was said to be performed in the Old Testament, casting some of the plagues of Egypt on two fans in an enclosed part of a restaurant, a transformation into a pillar of salt, exorcism of a demon, robbing a man of his strength as Samson had, apparently raising someone from the dead and pulling a coin from the mouth of a fish, performed on a boat in the Red Sea.\n\n\"The Magicians\" is a BBC primetime show, that aired its first series during January 2011. It featured Barry and Stuart alongside host Lenny Henry and fellow magicians Luis de Matos and Chris Korn. The show returned for its second series on 7 January 2012, with Barry and Stuart being the only personalities retained from series one. The second series featured two new magicians alongside Barry and Stuart; American magician Jason Latimer and English magician Pete Firman. This second series was broadcast live and was the first magic series to do so in the UK in 30 years \n\nIn December 2013 Barry and Stuart's latest show, \"The Happenings\", a four x 60 min series debuted in the UK on the digital channel Watch HD. The duo went undercover as they set about making the unbelievable paranormal-like events believable to the unsuspecting residents of towns across the UK and America.\n\nEach episode was a self-contained narrative and featured their magic and illusion under the guise of mysterious incidents that were played out over the course of a few weeks in four different towns. Episodes featured, ghosts, vampires, aliens and government cover-ups. A number of events filmed for the program made national headlines including their faked ghost sighting and alien landing.\n\nThe program was first broadcast internationally in April 2014 on the National Geographic Channel.\n\nIn 2008 the duo took their debut live show \"Part Time Warlocks\" to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Following 5 star reviews and a total sell out run, extra dates of the show were staged in a larger venue. In 2009 they returned to the Edinburgh Fringe with a new show \"Powered by Demons\" which they later performed at the Soho Theatre, London. Returning to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2010 they performed \"98% Séance\", a show where they used their magic to fake ghostly apparitions under the guise of a séance. In a five-star review, \"Time Out London\" described the show as \"a triumph of astonishing illusions, inventive technology, and unexpected frights.\" This show was the most positively tweeted about show at the Edinburgh Fringe 2010 according to the Realtime, crowd-sourced review website, EdTwinge.\n\nThey toured the UK in spring 2010 with \"Barry and Stuart: Live\". In 2011 they performed two shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, \"The Show\" and \"The Tell\". In \"The Show\" they performed an hour of magic, then a limited number of that audience had the chance to buy tickets for \"The Tell\" where they would witness the explanations to the all tricks they had just witnessed. In 2012 they toured the UK with \"Show and Tell\", a joint version of the two separate Edinburgh shows, and due to popular demand extended this tour into 2013.\n\nThey brought their live show for the first time to audiences in the United States with \"Barry and Stuart Live\" at Coronet Theatre Los Angeles in April 2013.\n\n"}

{"id": "30871348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30871348", "title": "Bourrée", "text": "Bourrée\n\nThe bourrée (; also in England, borry or bore) is a dance of French origin and the words and music that accompany it. The bourrée resembles the gavotte in that it is in double time and often has a dactylic rhythm. However, it is somewhat quicker, and its phrase starts with a quarter-bar anacrusis or \"pick-up\", whereas a gavotte has a half-bar anacrusis.\n\nIn the Baroque era, after the Academie de Dance was established by Louis XIV in 1661, the French court adapted the bourrée, like many such dances, for the purposes of concert dance. In this way it gave its name to a ballet step characteristic of the dance, a rapid movement of the feet while en pointe or demi-pointe, and so to the sequence of steps called \"pas de bourrée\".\n\nThe bourrée became an optional movement in the classical suite of dances, and J.S. Bach, Handel and Chopin wrote bourrées, not necessarily intending them to be danced. \n\nThe bourrée originates in Auvergne in France. It is sometimes called the \"French clog dance\" or a \"branle of the sabots\". First mentioned as a popular dance in 1665 in Clermont-Ferrand, it still survives in Auvergne in the Massif Central and in the department of Ariège and is danced during bals folk in France and in other countries. The present-day dance in lower Auvergne, also called Montagnarde (\"Montanhardas\"), is in triple time while that of high Auvergne called Auvergnate (\"Auvernhatas\") is in double time. Modern variants termed bourrées are danced as partner dances, circle dances, square dances and line dances.\n\nHowever bourrées have been composed as abstract musical pieces since the mid-16th century. Michael Praetorius mentions it in his musical compendium \"Syntagma musicum\" and introduces it as a dance in his \"Terpsichore\". However, there is no early dance notation and it is impossible to assess the early interaction of the folk dance and the courtly dance. Musically, the bourrée took on the common binary form of classical dance movements, sometimes extended by a second bourée, the two to be played in a grand ternary form; A–(A)–B–A.\n\nMarguerite de Navarre, who was sister to the King of Sweden, introduced the dance to the French court in 1565 and it was popular until the reign of Louis XIII (1601-1643) and opened many balls, but the bourrée took some time to appear in the early ballet dance notation of the French baroque theatre. The step with two movements is not illustrated by Feuillet but appears in Rameau as the \"true\" pas de bourée, the simpler step, with one movement, is identified with the \"fleuret\". The basic step, with one initial movement (i.e. a plié on the supporting leg) and three subsequent changes of weight in a measure, can be performed in a great many variations, and varieties of this step appear commonly throughout the notated dances that were published in the eighteenth century, starting with Feuillet in 1700.\n\nThe minuet step is a pas composé, a step composed of more basic steps. The pas de bourée of one movement is the second half of the most common minuet step, the minuet step of two movements, or \"one and a fleuret\", as the English master Tomlinson described it. The rare pas de bourée of two movements, mentioned above, occurs as a graceful variation in some recorded passapied, as part of a minuet step of three movements.\n\nAs later formalised in classical ballet the skipping step of the bourrée became a quick, gliding step, often \"en pointe\" or \"demi-pointe\", one of the most-used step sequences of ballet. A \"pas de bourrée\", more commonly known as the \"behind side front\" or \"back side front\", is a quick sequence of movements often taken in preparation for a larger step. In one account it begins with an extension of the first leg while \"demi plié\", closing it to the second as both transit to \"relevé\", extending the second leg to an open position and again closing first to second in \"demi plié \", or with legs straight if quick or as the final step of an \"enchainement\". There are several variants. A \"pas de bourrée piqué\" picks up the feet in between steps.\n\nIn his \"Der Vollkommene Capellmeister\" (Hamburg, 1739), Johann Mattheson wrote of the bourrée, \"its distinguishing feature resides in contentment and a pleasant demeanor, at the same time it is somewhat carefree and relaxed, a little indolent and easygoing, though not disagreeable\".\nJohann Sebastian Bach often used the bourrée in his suites as one of the optional dance movements that come after the sarabande but before the gigue, and he also wrote two short bourrées in his Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach. That in his Lute Suite in E Minor (BWV 996) is especially popular.\n\nHandel wrote several bourrées in his solo chamber sonatas (for example the fourth movement of his Oboe sonata in C minor); however, perhaps his best-known is the seventh movement of the \"Water Music\" (Handel) suite.\n\nIn the 19th century Frédéric Chopin and Emmanuel Chabrier wrote bourrées for the piano (such as the latter's \"Bourrée fantasque\", composed 1891). The Victorian English composer, Sir Hubert Parry included a bourrée in his \"Lady Radnor Suite\" (1894).\n\nThe bourrée has been used by a number of pop and rock music bands, particularly Bach's E minor Bourrée for the lute. In 1969 both Bakerloo and Jethro Tull released versions of this, the former as a single, \"Drivin' Bachwards\", on Harvest Records (HAR 5004) in July and on their self-titled debut album (Harvest SHVL 762) the following December, the latter on their August album \"Stand Up\". Paul McCartney also stated that The Beatles had known the tune for a long time and that it had inspired his song \"Blackbird\". Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin often played the opening section of \"Bourrée in E minor\" as part of the solo of a live performance of \"Heartbreaker\" and Tenacious D play a short rendering in \"Rock Your Socks\" on their eponymous album and in \"Classico\" on their second album. Rock guitarist Blues Saraceno plays a jazz version in the beginning and end of the track \"Bouree\" on his third album, \"Hairpick\".\n\nOther adapted bourées include:\n\n\n\n"}

It modulates, accelerates, and deflects electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television, computer monitor), radar targets, or other phenomena. CRTs have also been used as memory devices, in which case the visible light emitted from the fluorescent material (if any) is not intended to have significant meaning to a visual observer (though the visible pattern on the tube face may cryptically represent the stored data).\n\nIn television sets and computer monitors, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three electron beams, one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a video signal as a reference. In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by \"magnetic deflection\", a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of electronic test instrument.\n\nA CRT is constructed from a glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e., long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. The interior of a CRT is evacuated to approximately to , evacuation being necessary to facilitate the free flight of electrons from the gun(s) to the tube's face. The fact that it is evacuated makes handling an intact CRT potentially dangerous due to the risk of breaking the tube and causing a violent implosion that can hurl shards of glass at great velocity. As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick lead glass so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most X-ray emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.\n\nSince the late 2000s, CRTs have been largely superseded by newer \"flat panel\" display technologies such as LCD, plasma display, and especially OLED displays, which in the case of LCD and OLED displays have lower manufacturing costs and power consumption, as well as significantly less weight and bulk. Flat panel displays can also be made in very large sizes; whereas was about the largest size of a CRT television, flat panels are available in and larger sizes.\n\nCathode rays were discovered by Johann Wilhelm Hittorf in 1869 in primitive Crookes tubes. He observed that some unknown rays were emitted from the cathode (negative electrode) which could cast shadows on the glowing wall of the tube, indicating the rays were traveling in straight lines. In 1890, Arthur Schuster demonstrated cathode rays could be deflected by electric fields, and William Crookes showed they could be deflected by magnetic fields. In 1897, J. J. Thomson succeeded in measuring the mass of cathode rays, showing that they consisted of negatively charged particles smaller than atoms, the first \"subatomic particles\", which were later named \"electrons\". The earliest version of the CRT was known as the \"Braun tube\", invented by the German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1897. It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the Crookes tube with a phosphor-coated screen.\n\nThe first cathode-ray tube to use a hot cathode was developed by John B. Johnson (who gave his name to the term Johnson noise) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of Western Electric, and became a commercial product in 1922.\n\nIn 1925, Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a CRT television that received images with a 40-line resolution. By 1927, he improved the resolution to 100 lines, which was unrivaled until 1931. By 1928, he was the first to transmit human faces in half-tones on a CRT display. By 1935, he had invented an early all-electronic CRT television.\n\nIt was named in 1929 by inventor Vladimir K. Zworykin, who was influenced by Takayanagi's earlier work. RCA was granted a trademark for the term (for its cathode-ray tube) in 1932; it voluntarily released the term to the public domain in 1950.\n\nThe first commercially made electronic television sets with cathode-ray tubes were manufactured by Telefunken in Germany in 1934.\n\nFlat panel displays dropped in price and started significantly displacing cathode-ray tubes in the 2000s, with LCD screens exceeding CRTs in 2008.\nThe last known manufacturer of (in this case, recycled) CRTs ceased in 2015.\n\nIn oscilloscope CRTs, electrostatic deflection is used, rather than the magnetic deflection commonly used with television and other large CRTs. The beam is deflected horizontally by applying an electric field between a pair of plates to its left and right, and vertically by applying an electric field to plates above and below. Televisions use magnetic rather than electrostatic deflection because the deflection plates obstruct the beam when the deflection angle is as large as is required for tubes that are relatively short for their size.\n\nVarious phosphors are available depending upon the needs of the measurement or display application. The brightness, color, and persistence of the illumination depends upon the type of phosphor used on the CRT screen. Phosphors are available with persistences ranging from less than one microsecond to several seconds. For visual observation of brief transient events, a long persistence phosphor may be desirable. For events which are fast and repetitive, or high frequency, a short-persistence phosphor is generally preferable.\n\nWhen displaying fast one-shot events, the electron beam must deflect very quickly, with few electrons impinging on the screen, leading to a faint or invisible image on the display. Oscilloscope CRTs designed for very fast signals can give a brighter display by passing the electron beam through a micro-channel plate just before it reaches the screen. Through the phenomenon of secondary emission, this plate multiplies the number of electrons reaching the phosphor screen, giving a significant improvement in writing rate (brightness) and improved sensitivity and spot size as well.\n\nMost oscilloscopes have a graticule as part of the visual display, to facilitate measurements. The graticule may be permanently marked inside the face of the CRT, or it may be a transparent external plate made of glass or acrylic plastic. An internal graticule eliminates parallax error, but cannot be changed to accommodate different types of measurements. Oscilloscopes commonly provide a means for the graticule to be illuminated from the side, which improves its visibility.\n\nThese are found in \"analog phosphor storage oscilloscopes\". These are distinct from \"digital storage oscilloscopes\" which rely on solid state digital memory to store the image.\n\nWhere a single brief event is monitored by an oscilloscope, such an event will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, but only for a few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view storage cathode-ray tube (storage tube). A storage tube will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A storage tube is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a dielectric layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.\n\nWhen the main electron gun writes an image to the screen, the energy in the main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily to turn off the flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.\n\nThe Williams tube or Williams-Kilburn tube was a cathode-ray tube used to electronically store binary data. It was used in computers of the 1940s as a random-access digital storage device. In contrast to other CRTs in this article, the Williams tube was not a display device, and in fact could not be viewed since a metal plate covered its screen.\n\nColor tubes use three different phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively. They are packed together in stripes (as in aperture grille designs) or clusters called \"triads\" (as in shadow mask CRTs). Color CRTs have three electron guns, one for each primary color, arranged either in a straight line or in an equilateral triangular configuration (the guns are usually constructed as a single unit). (The triangular configuration is often called \"delta-gun\", based on its relation to the shape of the Greek letter delta Δ.) A grille or mask absorbs the electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor. A shadow mask tube uses a metal plate with tiny holes, placed so that the electron beam only illuminates the correct phosphors on the face of the tube; the holes are tapered so that the electrons that strike the inside of any hole will be reflected back, if they are not absorbed (e.g. due to local charge accumulation), instead of bouncing through the hole to strike a random (wrong) spot on the screen. Another type of color CRT uses an aperture grille of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result.\n\nDue to limitations in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, it has not been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, solely on the basis of the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.\n\nColor convergence and color purity are two aspects of this single problem. Firstly, for correct color rendering it is necessary that regardless of where the beams are deflected on the screen, all three hit the same spot (and nominally pass through the same hole or slot) on the shadow mask. This is called convergence. More specifically, the convergence at the center of the screen (with no deflection field applied by the yoke) is called static convergence, and the convergence over the rest of the screen area is called dynamic convergence. The beams may converge at the center of the screen and yet stray from each other as they are deflected toward the edges; such a CRT would be said to have good static convergence but poor dynamic convergence. Secondly, each beam must only strike the phosphors of the color it is intended to strike and no others. This is called purity. Like convergence, there is static purity and dynamic purity, with the same meanings of \"static\" and \"dynamic\" as for convergence. Convergence and purity are distinct parameters; a CRT could have good purity but poor convergence, or vice versa. Poor convergence causes color \"shadows\" or \"ghosts\" along displayed edges and contours, as if the image on the screen were intaglio printed with poor registration. Poor purity causes objects on the screen to appear off-color while their edges remain sharp. Purity and convergence problems can occur at the same time, in the same or different areas of the screen or both over the whole screen, and either uniformly or to greater or lesser degrees over different parts of the screen.\n\nThe solution to the static convergence and purity problems is a set of color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their magnetic fields parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field vector can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [two each for two magnets] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.\n\nOn some CRTs, additional fixed adjustable magnets are added for dynamic convergence or dynamic purity at specific points on the screen, typically near the corners or edges. Further adjustment of dynamic convergence and purity typically cannot be done passively, but requires active compensation circuits.\n\nDynamic color convergence and purity are one of the main reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex raster geometry parameters through electronics under user control.\n\nIf the shadow mask or aperture grille becomes magnetized, its magnetic field alters the paths of the electron beams. This causes errors of \"color purity\" as the electrons no longer follow only their intended paths, and some will hit some phosphors of colors other than the one intended. For example, some electrons from the red beam may hit blue or green phosphors, imposing a magenta or yellow tint to parts of the image that are supposed to be pure red. (This effect is localized to a specific area of the screen if the magnetization is localized.) Therefore, it is important that the shadow mask or aperture grille not be magnetized. \n\nMost color CRT displays, i.e. television sets and computer monitors, each have a built-in degaussing (demagnetizing) circuit, the primary component of which is a degaussing coil which is mounted around the perimeter of the CRT face inside the bezel. Upon power-up of the CRT display, the degaussing circuit produces a brief, alternating current through the degaussing coil which smoothly decays in strength (fades out) to zero over a period of a few seconds, producing a decaying alternating magnetic field from the coil. This degaussing field is strong enough to remove shadow mask magnetization in most cases. In unusual cases of strong magnetization where the internal degaussing field is not sufficient, the shadow mask may be degaussed externally with a stronger portable degausser or demagnetizer. However, an excessively strong magnetic field, whether alternating or constant, may mechanically deform (bend) the shadow mask, causing a permanent color distortion on the display which looks very similar to a magnetization effect.\n\nThe degaussing circuit is often built of a thermo-electric (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic heating element and a positive thermal coefficient (PTC) resistor, connected directly to the switched AC power line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance to a point where degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the ambient temperature; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.\n\nThis simple design is effective and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially Energy Star rated ones, use a relay to switch the entire degaussing circuit on and off, so that the degaussing circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through the unit's front panel controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off at the end of the degaussing cycle a few seconds after the monitor is turned on, and on and off during a manually initiated degaussing cycle.\n\nVector monitors were used in early computer aided design systems and are in some late-1970s to mid-1980s arcade games such as \"Asteroids\".\nThey draw graphics point-to-point, rather than scanning a raster. Either monochrome or color CRTs can be used in vector displays, and the essential principles of CRT design and operation are the same for either type of display; the main difference is in the beam deflection patterns and circuits.\n\nDot pitch defines the maximum resolution of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, moiré appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the shadow mask can render. Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moiré; however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.\n\nCRTs have a pronounced triode characteristic, which results in significant gamma (a nonlinear relationship in an electron gun between applied video voltage and beam intensity).\n\nIn better quality old-fashioned tube radio sets, a tuning guide consisting of a phosphor tube was used to aid the tuning adjustment. This was also known as a \"Magic Eye\" or \"Tuning Eye\". Tuning would be adjusted until the width of a radial shadow was minimized. This was used instead of a more expensive electromechanical meter, which later came to be used on higher-end tuners when transistor sets lacked the high voltage required to drive the device. The same type of device was used with tape recorders as a recording level meter, and for various other applications including electrical test equipment.\n\nSome displays for early computers (those that needed to display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used Charactron CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask (stencil), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so a second set of deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed toward the center of the screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.\n\nNimo was the trademark of a family of small specialised CRTs manufactured by Industrial Electronics Engineers. These had 10 electron guns which produced electron beams in the form of digits in a manner similar to that of the charactron. The tubes were either simple single-digit displays or more complex 4- or 6- digit displays produced by means of a suitable magnetic deflection system. Having little of the complexities of a standard CRT, the tube required a relatively simple driving circuit, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it provided a much wider viewing angle than competitive types (e.g., nixie tubes).\n\nFlood beam CRTs are small tubes that are arranged as pixels for large screens like Jumbotrons. The first screen using this technology was introduced by Mitsubishi Electric for the 1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It differs from a normal CRT in that the electron gun within does not produce a focused controllable beam. Instead, electrons are sprayed in a wide cone across the entire front of the phosphor screen, basically making each unit act as a single light bulb. Each one is coated with a red, green or blue phosphor, to make up the color sub-pixels. This technology has largely been replaced with light emitting diode displays. Unfocused and undeflected CRTs were used as grid-controlled stroboscope lamps since 1958.\n\nCRTs with an unphosphored front glass but with fine wires embedded in it were used as electrostatic print heads in the 1960s. The wires would pass the electron beam current through the glass onto a sheet of paper where the desired content was therefore deposited as an electrical charge pattern. The paper was then passed near a pool of liquid ink with the opposite charge. The charged areas of the paper attract the ink and thus form the image.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s Philips Research Laboratories experimented with a type of thin CRT known as the \"Zeus\" display which contained CRT-like functionality in a flat panel display. The devices were demonstrated but never marketed.\n\nSome CRT manufacturers, both LG Display and Samsung Display, innovated CRT technology by creating a slimmer tube. Slimmer CRT has a trade name Superslim and Ultraslim. A flat CRT has a depth. The depth of Superslim was and Ultraslim was .\n\nDespite being a mainstay of display technology for decades, CRT-based computer monitors and televisions are now virtually a dead technology. Demand for CRT screens dropped precipitously in the last half of the first decade of the 21st century. The rapid advances and falling prices of LCD flat panel technology -- first for computer monitors, and then for televisions -- spelled doom for competing display technologies such as CRT, rear-projection, and plasma display.\n\nMost high-end CRT production had ceased by around 2010, including high-end Sony and Mitsubishi product lines. In Canada and the United States, the sale and production of high-end CRT TVs ( screens) in these markets had all but ended by 2007. Just a couple of years later, inexpensive \"combo\" CRT TVs ( screens with an integrated VHS player) disappeared from discount stores.\n\nElectronics retailers such as Best Buy steadily reduced store spaces for CRTs. In 2005, Sony announced that they would stop the production of CRT computer displays. Samsung did not introduce any CRT models for the 2008 model year at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show; on 4 February 2008, they removed their 30\" wide screen CRTs from their North American website and did not replace them with new models.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, DSG (Dixons), the largest retailer of domestic electronic equipment, reported that CRT models made up 80–90% of the volume of televisions sold at Christmas 2004 and 15–20% a year later, and that they were expected to be less than 5% at the end of 2006. Dixons ceased selling CRT televisions in 2006.\n\nHowever, the demise of CRTs has been happening more slowly in the developing world. According to iSupply, production in units of CRTs was not surpassed by LCDs production until 4Q 2007, owing largely to CRT production at factories in China.\n\nCRTs, despite advances, remained relatively heavy and cumbersome in comparison to other display technologies. CRT screens had much deeper cabinets compared to flat panels and rear-projection displays for a given screen size; it was largely impractical to build or use CRTs larger than . The CRT disadvantages became especially significant in light of rapid technological advancements in LCD and plasma flat-panels, which allowed them to easily surpass these size limitations while also being thin and wall-mountable (two key features that were increasingly being preferred by customers).\n\nCRTs can emit a small amount of X-ray radiation as a result of the electron beam's bombardment of the shadow mask/aperture grille and phosphors. The amount of radiation escaping the front of the monitor is widely considered not to be harmful. The Food and Drug Administration regulations in are used to strictly limit, for instance, television receivers to 0.5 milliroentgens per hour (mR/h) (0.13 µC/(kg·h) or 36 pA/kg) at a distance of from any external surface; since 2007, most CRTs have emissions that fall well below this limit.\n\nOlder color and monochrome CRTs may have been manufactured with toxic substances, such as cadmium, in the phosphors. The rear glass tube of modern CRTs may be made from leaded glass, which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly. By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead, though the rear of the CRT was still produced from leaded glass. Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough leaded glass to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leach (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to leaded glass crystalware).\n\nDue to the toxins contained in CRT monitors the United States Environmental Protection Agency created rules (in October 2001) stating that CRTs must be brought to special e-waste recycling facilities. In November 2002, the EPA began fining companies that disposed of CRTs through landfills or incineration. Regulatory agencies, local and statewide, monitor the disposal of CRTs and other computer equipment.\n\nVarious states participate in the recycling of CRTs, each with their reporting requirements for collectors and recycling facilities. For example, in California the recycling of CRTs is governed by CALRecycle, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery through their Payment System. . Recycling facilities that accept CRT devices from business and residential sector must obtain contact information such as address and phone number to ensure the CRTs come from a California source in order to participate in the CRT Recycling Payment System. \n\nIn Europe, disposal of CRT televisions and monitors is covered by the WEEE Directive.\n\nAt low refresh rates (60 Hz and below), the periodic scanning of the display may produce a flicker that some people perceive more easily than others, especially when viewed with peripheral vision. Flicker is commonly associated with CRT as most televisions run at 50 Hz (PAL) or 60 Hz (NTSC), although there are some 100 Hz PAL televisions that are flicker-free. Typically only low-end monitors run at such low frequencies, with most computer monitors supporting at least 75 Hz and high-end monitors capable of 100 Hz or more to eliminate any perception of flicker. Though the 100 Hz PAL was often achieved using interleaved scanning, dividing the circuit and scan into two beams of 50 Hz. Non-computer CRTs or CRT for sonar or radar may have long persistence phosphor and are thus flicker free. If the persistence is too long on a video display, moving images will be blurred.\n\n50 Hz/60 Hz CRTs used for television operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734 Hz (for NTSC systems) or 15,625 Hz (for PAL systems). These frequencies are at the upper range of human hearing and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT. The sound is due to magnetostriction in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the flyback transformer.\n\nThis problem does not occur on 100/120 Hz TVs and on non-CGA (Color Graphics Adapter) computer displays, because they use much higher horizontal scanning frequencies (22 kHz to over 100 kHz).\n\nHigh vacuum inside glass-walled cathode-ray tubes permits electron beams to fly freely—without colliding into molecules of air or other gas. If the glass is damaged, atmospheric pressure can collapse the vacuum tube into dangerous fragments which accelerate inward and then spray at high speed in all directions. The implosion energy is proportional to the evacuated volume of the CRT. Although modern cathode-ray tubes used in televisions and computer displays have epoxy-bonded face-plates or other measures to prevent shattering of the envelope, CRTs must be handled carefully to avoid personal injury.\n\nTo accelerate the electrons from the cathode to the screen with sufficient velocity, a very high voltage (EHT or Extra High Tension) is required, from a few thousand volts for a small oscilloscope CRT to tens of kV for a larger screen color TV. This is many times greater than household power supply voltage. Even after the power supply is turned off, some associated capacitors and the CRT itself may retain a charge for some time and therefore dissipate that charge suddenly through a ground such as an inattentive human grounding a capacitor discharge lead.\n\nUnder some circumstances, the signal radiated from the electron guns, scanning circuitry, and associated wiring of a CRT can be captured remotely and used to reconstruct what is shown on the CRT using a process called Van Eck phreaking. Special TEMPEST shielding can mitigate this effect. Such radiation of a potentially exploitable signal, however, occurs also with other display technologies and with electronics in general.\n\nAs electronic waste, CRTs are considered one of the hardest types to recycle. CRTs have relatively high concentration of lead and phosphors (not phosphorus), both of which are necessary for the display. There are several companies in the United States that charge a small fee to collect CRTs, then subsidize their labor by selling the harvested copper, wire, and printed circuit boards. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) includes discarded CRT monitors in its category of \"hazardous household waste\" but considers CRTs that have been set aside for testing to be commodities if they are not discarded, speculatively accumulated, or left unprotected from weather and other damage.\n\nLeaded CRT glass was sold to be remelted into other CRTs, or even broken down and used in road construction.\n\nBasics of cathode rays and discharge in low-pressure gas:\n\nLight production by cathode rays:\n\nManipulating the electron beam:\n\nApplying CRT in different display-purpose:\n\nMiscellaneous phenomena:\n\nHistorical aspects:\n\nSafety and precautions:\n\n\n"}

A piece created using centonization is known as a \"centonate\" (Randel 2002, 123).\n\nThe concept of centonization was borrowed from literary theory, and first applied to Gregorian chant in 1934 by Dom Paolo Ferretti (Chew and McKinnon 2001; Treitler 1975, 7).\n\nCentonization, according to Ferretti's theory, is a very old and widespread technique. The musical modes used in Gregorian chant are supposed to reflect this use; according to the theory, the modes were more collections of appropriate melodic formulas than a set of pitches. Similar ideas appear in the music theory of other cultures; for example, the maqam of Arab music, the raga of Indian music, or the pathet of Indonesian music. These do not designate merely scales, but sets of appropriate melodies and specific ornaments on certain tones (they are sometimes called \"melody types\") (Powers et al. 2001). The originality of the composer lies in how he or she links these formulas together and elaborates upon them in a new way.\n\nRegardless of whether the application of the concept to other branches of Christian chant, or other types of music is valid, its use with respect to Gregorian chant has been severely criticized, and opposing models have been proposed (Hiley 1993, 74–75; Treitler 1974, 356; Treitler 1975, 14–15 & 22–23). The term \"centonate\" is not applied to other categories of composition constructed from pre-existing units, such as \"fricassée\", \"pasticcio\", \"potpourri\", and \"quodlibet\" (Chew and McKinnon 2001).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1645630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1645630", "title": "Cinema of Greece", "text": "Cinema of Greece\n\nThe Cinema of Greece has a long and rich history. Though hampered at times by war or political instability, the Greek film industry dominates the domestic market and has experienced international success. Characteristics of Greek cinema include a dynamic plot, strong character development and erotic themes. Two Greek films, \"Missing\" (1982) and \"Eternity and a Day\" (1998), have won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Five Greek films have received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nThough Greek cinema took root in the early 1900s, the first mature films weren't produced until the 1920s, after the end of the Greco-Turkish War. Films during this period, such as \"Astero\" (1929) by Dimitris Gaziadis and \"Maria Pentagiotissa\" (1929) by Ahilleas Madras, consisted of emotional melodramas with an abundance of folkloristic elements. Orestis Laskos's \"Daphnis and Chloe\" (1931), one of the first Greek films to be shown abroad, contained the first voyeuristic nude scene in a European film. During the Axis occupation, the Greek film industry struggled as it was forced to relocate overseas.\n\nFollowing the Greek Civil War, Greek cinema experienced a revival. Inspired by Italian neorealism, directors such as Grigoris Grigoriou and Stelios Tatasopoulos created works during this period shot on location using non-professional actors. During the 1950s and 1960s, Greek cinema experienced a golden age, starting with Michael Cacoyannis's \"Stella\" (1955), which was screened at Cannes. The 1960 film \"Never on Sunday\" was nominated for five Academy Awards, and its lead actress, Melina Mercouri, won the Best Actress Award at Cannes. Cacoyannis's \"Zorba the Greek\" (1964) won three Academy Awards.\n\nCensorship policies of the 1967 junta and rising foreign competition led to a decline in Greek cinema. After the restoration of democracy in the mid-1970s, the Greek film industry again flourished, led by director Theo Angelopoulos, whose films frequently captured international awards. The drift toward art-house cinema in the 1980s led to a decline in audiences, however. In the 1990s, younger Greek filmmakers began experimenting with iconographic motifs. In spite of funding issues created by the financial crisis in the late 2000s, unique Greek films such as Yorgos Lanthimos's \"Dogtooth\" (2009) and Athina Rachel Tsangari's \"Attenberg\" (2010) received international acclaim.\n\nIn the spring of 1897, the Greeks of Athens watched the first cinematic ventures (short movies in \"journal\"). In 1906 Greek Cinema was born when the Manakis brothers started recording in Macedonia, and the French filmmaker \"Leons\" produced the first \"Newscast\" from the midi-Olympic games of Athens (the unofficial Olympic games of 1906).\n\nThe first cine-theater of Athens opened about a year later and other special 'projection rooms' begun their activity. In 1910-11 the first short comic movies were produced by director Spiros Dimitrakopoulos, who also starred in most of his movies. In 1911 Kostas Bachatoris presented \"Golfo ()\", a well known traditional love story, considered the first Greek feature film. In 1912 was founded the first film company (Athina Film) and in 1916 the Asty Film.\n\nDuring the First World War, production was limited to documentaries and newscasts only. Directors like George Prokopiou and Dimitris Gaziadis are distinguished for filming scenes from the battlefield and later, during the Greco-Turkish War, the burning of Smyrna (1922).\n\nThe first commercially successful Greek film was \"Villar in the Women's Baths of Faliro\" (\"\"), written, directed by and starring comedian Villar (Nikolaos Sfakianakis) and Nitsa Philosofou. In 1924, Michael Michael (1895–1944), a Greek comedian, presented some short film comedies.\n\nIn 1926, Gaziadis founded Dag Films and tried to produce the first speaking movies. This company presented its first movie, \"Love and Waves\" (\"Eros kai kymata\"), in 1927, and experienced moderate success in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The company mainly produced historical movies, usually adaptations of novels. In 1930, Dag produced a speaking movie, \"Apaches of Athens\" (\"Oi Apahides ton Athinon\"), which was based on a Greek operetta by Nikos Hatziapostolou. Gaziadis also filmed the 1927 Delphic Festival, an idea of Angelos Sikelianos, with the support of his wife, as part of his general effort towards the revival of the \"Delphic Idea\". The event consisted of Olympic contests, an exhibition of folk art, and a performance of \"Prometheus Bound\".\n\nThe 1931 film \"Daphnis and Chloe\" (\"Δάφνις και Χλόη\"), directed by Orestis Laskos (1908–1992), contained the first voyeuristic nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad. In 1932 Olympia Films presented the movie \"The Shepherdess's Lover\" (\"Ο αγαπητικός της βοσκοπούλας\"), which was based on a play by Dimitris Koromilas. Also influential during this period was director Ahilleas Madras, whose work included \"Maria Pentagiotissa\" (1929) and \"Sorcerer of Athens\" (1931).\n\nDuring the late 1930s, a number of Greek filmmakers fled Greece due to the hostility of Metaxas Regime, which came to power following a coup in 1936. The Greek film industry reemerged in Turkey, and later in Egypt. In spite of German occupation during World War II, Philopemen Finos, a film producer who was active in the Greek Resistance, founded Finos Films (1942), which would later become one of the most commercially successful Greek studios. One of Finos's earliest productions, \"Voice of the Heart\" (') (1943, directed by Dimitris Ioannopoulos), drew large audiences, to the consternation of the Germans. Another important film during this period, \"Applause\" (') (1944, directed by George Tzavellas), was produced by Finos's rival, Novak Films.\n\nIn 1944 Katina Paxinou was honoured with the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as \"Pilar\" in the Sam Wood film, \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\".\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s are considered by many to be the \"Golden Age\" of Greek cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: Mihalis Kakogiannis, Alekos Sakellarios, Melina Mercouri, Nikos Tsiforos, Iakovos Kambanelis, Katina Paxinou, Nikos Koundouros, Ellie Lambeti, and Irene Papas. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements. Notable films were \"The Counterfeit Coin\" (', 1955 directed by George Tzavellas), \"Bitter Bread\" (', 1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), and \"The Ogre of Athens\" (\"\", 1956, directed by Nikos Koundouros).\n\nFinos Film and director Alekos Sakellarios collaborated on several films in the late 1950s, namely \"The Hurdy-Gurdy\" (', 1955) and its sequel, \"Laterna, ftoheia kai garyfallo\" (', 1958), as well as \"Aunt from Chicago\" (', 1957) and \"Maiden's Cheek\" (', 1959).\n\nThe 1955 film \"Stella\", directed by Michael Cacoyannis and written by Iakovos Kambanelis, was screened at Cannes, and launched Greek cinema into its \"golden age.\" Melina Mercouri, who starred in the film, met American expatriate director Jules Dassin at Cannes while attending the screening, and the two would eventually marry. Dassin directed the 1960 Greek film, \"Never on Sunday\", which starred Mercouri. The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Mercouri, and won the Academy Award for Best Song for composer Manos Hatzidakis' title track. The couple also collaborated on the 1967 musical stage adaptation, \"Illya Darling\", for which Mercouri received a Tony Award nomination. She went on to star in such films as \"Topkapi\" and \"Phaedra\", both directed by Dassin, and the 1969 American comedy, \"Gaily, Gaily\".\n\nCacoyannis' 1964 film, \"Zorba the Greek\", which starred Anthony Quinn, was a major commercial success, and was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film. The movie was based on the novel, \"Zorba the Greek\", by author Nikos Kazantzakis. Other important films during this period include \"Antigone\" (1961) and \"Electra\" (1962), both of which starred Irene Papas, \"The Red Lanterns\" (1963) by director Vasilis Georgiadis, and \"Battlefield Constantinople\" (1970), which starred the \"Greek Brigitte Bardot,\" Aliki Vougiouklaki.\n\nThe Thessaloniki International Film Festival was first held in 1960, and would subsequently evolve into the primary showcase for emerging filmmakers from Greece and the Balkans region. The festival showcases both international and Greek films, and awards the \"Golden Alexander\" for the best feature film.\n\nIn 1969, the Costa-Gavras film \"Z\" was nominated for the Academy Award for both Best Foreign Language Film and Best Picture.\n\nThe production of Greek films increased after the fall of the dictatorship in the mid-1970s, though the industry struggled with foreign competition and the rise of television. Michael Cacoyannis' 1977 film, \"Iphigenia\", was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. During the 1970s and 1980s Theo Angelopoulos directed a series of critically acclaimed movies, among them \"The Travelling Players\" (1975), \"The Hunters\" (1977), and \"Voyage to Cythera\" (1984). His film \"Eternity and a Day\" won the Palme d'Or and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. Costa-Gavras's film \"Missing\" won the Palme d'Or at 1982 Cannes Film Festival. Director Costas Ferris's 1983 film, \"Rembetiko\", won the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nWhen the left-leaning Panhellenic Socialist Movement was elected to power in 1981, actress Melina Mercouri, a member of the party, was appointed Minister for Culture. In this role, she obtained government support for the Greek film industry, and set up networks to promote Greek cinema abroad. The increase in government funding led to a predominance of slow-moving, cerebral art-house films, which lacked mass appeal.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, younger directors turned to more contemporary-paced films and social satires, which brought moderate commercial success. In 1999, TV series writers Michalis Reppas and Thanasis Papathanasiou, collaborating with contemporary famous actors made the sex taboo comedy \"Safe Sex\", which was the most successful movie of the decade.\n\nIn 1998, with Money, A Mythology of Darkness, Vassilis Mazomenos created the first European feature 3D animation film, a visual essay on the impact of money on humanity. The film has been acclaimed in both Greece and abroad, nominated for the European Fantasy Award (George Melies award) in 1999 and won the same year the jury's special award in Fantasporto. Known for his artistic experimentation and influences from early German expressionism, Mazomenos later developed a different narrative with his movies \"Guilt\" (2009) and \"10th Day\" (2012). His latest film \"Lines\" (2016) focusing on seven individuals suffering from the economic crisis that has devastated Greece, earned critical and festival acclaim. \n\nIn 2003, \"A Touch of Spice\" (\"Politiki kouzina\"), a big-budget film by director Tasos Boulmetis, was the most successful film of the year at the Greek box office, making over 12 million euros. 2004 was also a good year for Greek films, with Pantelis Voulgaris's \"Brides\" (\"Nyfes\") gathering more than a million spectators and over 7 million at the box office. In 2007 the most successful film was \"El Greco\", directed by Yannis Smaragdis.\n\nIn 2009, \"Dogtooth\", directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, won the Prix Un Certain Regard at the Cannes Film Festival, and in 2011 was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards. The 2010 film \"Attenberg\", directed by Athina Rachel Tsangari, won the Coppa Volpi Award for Best Actress (Ariane Labed) at the Venice Film Festival. In 2011 \"Alps\" won the Osella Award for Best Screenplay (Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthimiοs Filippou) at the 68th Venice Film Festival. \"Dogtooth\", \"Attenberg\" and \"Alps\" are part of what some film critics, including Steve Rose of \"The Guardian\", have termed the \"Greek Weird Wave,\" which involves movies with haunting cinematography, alienated protagonists and absurdist dialogue. Other films mentioned as part of this \"wave\" include Panos H. Koutras's \"Strella\" (2009) and Yannis Economides's \"Knifer\" (2010).\n\nIn 2011, just twenty feature-films were produced.\n\nIn 2013, \"Miss Violence\", directed by Alexandros Arvanas won Silver Lion for best director at the 70th Venice International Film Festival. Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\", compared the film to the previously mentioned, saying that \"It (self-evidently) does not have the humour of those movies by Yorgos Lanthimos and Athina Rachel Tsangari and by that token, less of their richness and inventiveness. But its force can't be doubted.\"\n\nPre-WWII\n\nAfter-WWII (Golden age)\n\nModern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16663203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16663203", "title": "Comedy (drama)", "text": "Comedy (drama)\n\nA comedy is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh. For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the Middle Ages, the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense Dante used the term in the title of his poem, the \"Divine Comedy\" (Italian: \"Divina Commedia\").\n\nThe phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and agreed upon the predominating characteristics are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus Thomas Hobbes speaks of laughter as a \"sudden glory.\" Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the \"play instinct\" and its emotional expression.\n\nMuch comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of opposite expectations, but there are many recognized genres of comedy. Satire and political satire use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.\n\nParody borrows the form of some popular genre, artwork, or text but uses certain ironic changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). Screwball comedy derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. Black comedy is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or evil elements in human nature. Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comedic ways.\n\nA comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. Romantic comedy is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.\n\nThe word \"comedy\" is derived from the Classical Greek κωμῳδία, which is a compound either of \"κῶμος\" (revel) or \"κώμη\" (village) and \"ᾠδή\" (singing): it is possible that \"κῶμος\" itself is derived from \"κώμη\", and originally meant a village revel. The adjective \"comic\" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of \"laughter-provoking\". The word came into modern usage through the Latin \"comoedia \"and Italian \"commedia\" and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.\n\nIn ancient Greece, comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the \"Poetics\", Aristotle states that comedy originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, Aristotle taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for Aristotle is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for Aristotle that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. \n\nOn the contrary, the Greek Philosopher Plato taught that comedy is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In The Republic (Plato), he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, \"for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\" Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.\n\nNorthrop Frye described the comic genre as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old\", \"The Anatomy of Criticism\". 1957, but this dichotomy is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation. A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.\n\n\nfrom what has been discussed\n\n"}

If there is only \"one\" character talking aloud, it is a monologue.\n\n\"\"This breakfast is making me sick,\" George said.\"\n\nThe \"George said\" is the identifier. \"Said\" is the verb most writers use because reader familiarity with \"said\" prevents it from drawing attention to itself. Although other verbs such as \"ask\", \"shout\", or \"reply\" are acceptable, some identifiers get in the reader's way. For example:\n\n\"\"Hello,\" he croaked nervously, \"my name's Horace.\"<br>\n\"What's yours?\" he asked with as much aplomb as he could muster.\"\nanother example is:\n\"My name is Peg, what's yours?\" I asked.\n\"My name is William, but my friends call me Will,\" said Will.\n\nStephen King, in his book \"\", expresses his belief that \"said\" is the best identifier to use. King recommends reading a novel by Larry McMurtry, who he claims has mastered the art of well-written dialogue.\n\nSubstitutes are known as \"said-bookisms\". For example, in the sentence \"\"What do you mean?\" he smiled.\", the word \"smiled\" is a said-bookism.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Georgia, grew up in Switzerland, and later lived in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nHe owned the \"Crawdaddy Club\" in London where The Rolling Stones were the house band, and he was involved with their early management. He hired The Yardbirds as a replacement and managed them. He was also their producer from the beginning through 1966. In 1967, he started Marmalade Records (distributed by Polydor), which featured \"Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity\", The Blossom Toes, and early recordings by Graham Gouldman and Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, who became 10cc. The label closed in 1969. Gomelsky was also instrumental in the careers of The Soft Machine, Daevid Allen and Gong, Magma and Material.\n\nGomelsky was born in Tiflis, Georgia. His father was a medical doctor, and his mother was from Monte Carlo. The family left in 1938 and via Syria, Egypt, and Italy, in 1944 settled in Switzerland, the country where his father had trained.\n\nGiorgio discovered jazz at the age of 10, while living in Italy. One Sunday he was caught out by the 4pm German curfew, so he stayed in the house of friends. Exploring their attic he discovered a gramophone and some jazz records. As a symbol of defiance he and his friends took to occasionally briefly blasting the music out of the window. Fortunately they were never caught. After the liberation, eventually black GIs arrived and furthered his jazz education.\n\nHe attended a Benedictine school in Ascona, near Locarno, Switzerland. With the war over, he was able to pool resources with friends to start a record collection. By 1946, the American Forces Network had been established and Giorgio was exposed to be-bop via the \"Cool City\" program on VOA. (In 1964, his father having died and left him some money, Giorgio would return to Ascona and stage a jazz festival in a local airfield.)\n\nHe attended a progressive private school, the run by , in the mountains of Switzerland. While on vacation, with friends, he travelled around Europe by bicycle. In post-war Germany, they found a thriving cellar-jazz scene in towns like Düsseldorf. They visited Milan, and pedalled all the way to Paris to see Charlie Parker perform at the Salon de Jazz.\n\nHis mother was a hat designer. Her father had worked for the Société des Bains de Mer (the casino operator) in Monte Carlo, a popular resort for the British, and so she spoke English and became an anglophile, with a particular love of English literature. Thus her employer, Claude Saint-Cyr of Paris, sent her to run her atelier in London. She would send her Swiss schoolboy son the English music paper \"Melody Maker\" on a weekly basis, from which Giorgio learned English and also became familiar with the British jazz scene.\n\nThere was still at this time limited opportunity to hear new jazz in Europe, apart from Willis Conover on VOA. There was an Italian jazz radio show; Flavio Ambrosetti's show on Swiss Radio ran just 20 minutes a week; there was Charles Delaunay jazz show on Europe 1 in Paris; and Charlie Fox on the BBC; and maybe a couple of German shows. There was a scene in Copenhagen. Aficionados in many cities set up jazz appreciation societies, and Giorgio and friends set one up in Locarno. A trio was formed, Roland Schramlei on bass, Bert Armbruster on piano, and Giorgio on drums. Resources were so limited that, only possessing a ride cymbal, Giorgio would have to hire a drum kit every time they had an engagement.\n\nThe main jazz magazine was Les Cahiers du Jazz from Paris, and there was also one in Italy. In both countries the magazines organized the local Jazz Societies into Federations which could then stage concert tours. Giorgio followed their model and formed a Swiss federation that staged concerts. In 1954, having been denied permission to stage a concert during the Zurich Festival by the city fathers, the Federation staged a daring protest on a Sunday. The resulting publicity persuaded the City to reverse its decision, and thus the Zurich Jazz Festival was born (and exists to this day).\n\nHaving become a Swiss citizen, Giorgio had to perform National Service, undergoing basic training with Swiss Air Force, where he flew Bucher biplanes. Although a proficient pilot he deliberately failed promotion tests and, after rejection, was then free to leave the country.\n\nThe weekly readings of the Melody Maker, and the lack of further documentation, convinced Giorgio that his vocation would be to film the burgeoning UK jazz scene. He had seen the 1948 film \"Jammin' the Blues\" and had formed forward-thinking stylistic ideas including synchronised fast cutting. He succeeded in obtaining a 500 UKP commission from a young Italian TV station and departed for England.\n\nIn London he established a relationship with the National Jazz Federation, run by Harold Pendleton, who also managed Britain's top jazz star of the time Chris Barber. Despite Giorgio's inclination to shoot the avant-garde Johnny Dankworth, Pendleton prevailed on him to shoot Chris Barber. The resulting piece, comprising four songs, intercut establishing and audience reaction shots from the Royal Festival Hall with separate studio session footage. The studio footage, shot in one day, used cutting-edge technology like large Mitchell cameras with 'elephant' suspended mics that restricted camera movements in the small studio, preventing Giorgio from getting all the angles he had hoped for.\n\nThis first film was sufficiently well-received that two years later Giorgio filmed Chris Barber for a second time – now a 3 camera shoot in b&w Cinemascope.\n\nHarold Pendleton had started the National Jazz Festival and Giorgio had participated as a volunteer helper at the first one in 1959. He was able to secure the rights to film the 1960 festival. A producer/backer was found – Frank Green, the owner of a facility on Wardour Street where Giorgio had edited his earlier films. Filming was with 4 b/w cameras. Sound was recorded on the Leevers-Rich synchro-pulse system, allowing separate recording of audio on magnetic tape. The intercom between the cameras was the Royal Artillery's system which, designed to be heard over cannon fire, was so loud that at times it would get picked up by the stage mics. Giorgio edited two pilots from the footage, including a piece of the new Alexis Korner Blues Incorporated with Charlie Watts on drums, but Green was unable to find a buyer.\n\nChris Barber's trad-jazz band had launched the skiffle craze, and their hit \"Rock Island Line\" had made the band's banjo player Lonnie Donegan a star. As skiffle became passé, Chris, whose sets were structured around the history of jazz, began to feature blues in its place, utilizing his school friend vocalist/guitarist Alexis Korner, and harmonica player Cyril Davies.\n\nWhile the Barber blues set was strictly country style, Korner was set on expanding the sound to incorporate the more modern electric Chicago sound and an improvisational jazz approach. He formed his own group Alexis Korner Blues Incorporated and recruited musicians like drummer Charlie Watts and saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith.. Giorgio, then writing for Jazz News, became inspired by this to the extent of becoming evangelical. He coined the term BRB – British Rhythm and Blues, wrote articles, and bent the ear of anyone who would listen.\n\nAlex and Cyril had a club in a pub upstairs room on Wardour Street where blues aficionados would gather on Wednesdays but they needed a larger venue for the noisy big band. With some difficulty, and support from Barber, Giorgio persuaded Pendleton to run a weekly Blues Night on Thursdays at his newly opened neighbouring club The Marquee. Korner's new band, and others, were duly booked. However the audiences were still limited to a small group of enthusiasts and the future was uncertain.\n\nA Jamaican Blue Beat club just off Portobello Road (immortalized in the move Scandal) was one of the hottest spots in London at the time. On a visit Giorgio had a chance encounter with its most notorious clients – Christine Keeler & Mandy Rice-Davies. He invited them to visit the Marquee Blues Night and they showed up the following week. The publicity generated was enough to give the night sufficient cachet to become fashionable and successful.\n\nGiorgio wanted to build on the success of The Marquee Blues night with more shows but Pendleton wasn't interested. Giorgio began to organize the bands, suggesting that they work co-operatively to obtain bookings and do other business, just as the earlier Jazz Societies had federated their efforts. He even persuaded the Portobello Jamaican club to host a couple of blues bands, however the regular patrons were not impressed.\n\nGiorgio then discovered an alternative venue – the Cy Laurie Piccadilly Club in Ham Yard. Formerly a major London hotspot, it was now on its uppers. He was able to secure a Saturday night for a fee of $5 and proceeded to stage the first festival of British Blues. Bands appearing included Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated, Blues By Six (which included Nicky Hopkins), and the Rolling Stones. Although attendance was slight, as a promotional device Giorgio prevailed on a number of friends to stand in line outside to attract the attention of passers by, and give the impression of a larger crowd. Pendleton was not at all happy with this local competition for his club.\n\nGomelsky was certain that the vitality of the genre depended on attracting new young fans, and that attracting young fans depended on involving young musicians. Giorgio believed that residencies were the key to building an audience for the new bands and, in an example of the lateral thinking instilled him in the Switzerland mountain school, hit on the idea of eschewing central London and weekday nights altogether – to become so far removed that Pendleton could have no grounds for complaint. Thus the Richmond Blues Association was formed and he secured a series of Sunday nights at the Station Hotel in Richmond, a suburb of West London. What Giorgio knew, from his earlier be-bop interests, was that the nearby Kingston Art School was a fertile hotbed of musical enthusiasm, and also there already was an established blues club in the basement of the ABC Cafe in nearby Ealing. Another group having dropped out, The Rolling Stones were given the first residency. The first night only attracted three people, attendance not being helped by Giorgio, in a typical malapropism, accidentally writing \"Rhythm & Bulls\" on the advertising sign outside the venue. Nevertheless, the talents of the Rolling Stones, and a promotional scheme that gave complimentary admission to any patron that brought two friends, soon led to healthy crowds. Also, in order to liven up the proceedings, he convinced the Stones, whose repertoire was stretched by the demands of two 45-minute sets, to incorporate a 20-minute rave-up version of Bo Diddley's \"Crawdad\" (originally on the 1960 album \"Bo Diddley in the Spotlight\") as the finale of their show.\n\nIn fact, Giorgio had taken on much of the responsibility for managing and promoting the Rolling Stones. Looking to get press on the band, he prevailed on The Richmond and Twickenham Times, a conservative local paper owned by TV presenter Richard Dimbleby, to send a reporter to the Station Hotel. Eventually a reporter, Barry May, undertook to write an article and visited the venue with a photographer.\n\nGiorgio also considered he could exploit his reputation as a jazz writer and film-maker to generate interest in the band and entice the jazz critics to visit the Sunday Richmond sessions. He announced that he would make a short promotional film of these \"illustrious unknowns\". The news spread and influential writers – first Norman Jopling, and then Peter Jones – showed up, but no copy resulted. Peter Jones did, however, return bringing his friend Andrew Loog Oldham.\n\nNot having the facilities to film the band live at the club, he took them into the RG Jones recording studio in Wimbledon, one of the few independent studios in London at the time. Two songs were recorded and extra footage shot. As Giorgio was editing he got a call from Gay, who was writing his article, asking how to name the club. Giorgio, on the spur of the moment, inspired by \"Crawdad\" – the high point of The Stones' show, with a chorus of \"Hey, crawdaddy!\" - came up with \"The Crawdaddy\".\n\nSomewhat to his surprise and delight, a full page feature duly appeared in the Richmond and Twickenham Times. Giorgio showed the article to acquaintance Patrick Doncaster, the music critic of the \"Daily Mirror\", the largest circulation British daily newspaper. Doncaster was persuaded to, in turn, visit the club, and a half-page feature duly appeared in the next day's \"Mirror\". The powers that be at Ind Coope Breweries, owners of the Station Hotel, were aghast at the degenerate behaviour displayed in the article and the club was evicted forthwith.\n\nAlmost immediately Giorgio had to return to Switzerland, for three weeks, as his father had died. His colleague, photographer Hamish Grimes, went to Pendleton, who provided an introduction to Commander Wheeler, director of the Richmond Athletic Association. They had grounds, just a block away from the Station Hotel, where the National Jazz Festival was held. An arrangement was made for the club to move to a room, almost triple the capacity of the Station Hotel, below the grandstand.\n\nIn the 1960s, Giorgio went on to manage and produce The Yardbirds, and form a record label Marmalade Records. He also signed Julie Driscoll and Brian Auger & The Trinity and produced early recordings by Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page (both of whom played with the Yardbirds),[Blossom Toes] Rod Stewart, and John McLaughlin (the 1969 album \"Extrapolation\"), Alexis Korner. Graham Bond and the Soft Machine.\n\nHe brought British rock musicians to record with American blues musicians including the Yardbirds featuring Eric Clapton with Sonny Boy Williamson, who was Giorgio's roommate for a period in Britain. Giorgio claims that Sonny Boy jammed with Rahsaan Roland Kirk in all keys on a single blues harmonica made to play in one key.\n\nIn the 1970s he became involved with progressive jazz rock bands such as Gong, Henry Cow and Magma. In the 1980s he was pioneer of digital video winning awards for his work using the Video Toaster.\n\nThrough the 1970s to the 2010s from his recording and rehearsal studio, Red Door (venue), in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City, Giorgio has continued to nurture and mentor musicians. Following his relationship with the band Material, in the early 1980s he produced \"Tonka Wonka Mondays\" at the Bitter End, featuring three bands a night who were unnamed \"mystery guests\", and then had professional music critics dissect their performances during the break: at the end of each evening, a better known featured guest would play their material backed up by \"The House Band\" led by composer / arranger Dave Soldier and featuring trumpeter Roy Campbell: featured guests included Wayne Kramer, Billy Bang, Frank Lowe, and Dennis Charles. Giorgio was also a regular DJ at the club Tramps, introducing fans to an array of styles, including new African and experimental jazz music.\n\nWith the producer Joe Papp and early b-boy hiphop stars including Futura 2000, Mr. Freeze, Lori Eastside and composers Dave Soldier and Mark Mazur of Kid Creole and the Coconuts he attempted to produce the first hip-hop musical, Persons, at the Public Theater in 1982.\n\nHe was instrumental in bringing the important Czech group, the Plastic People of the Universe, to the international public eye by producing a benefit concert for the band's lyricist Egon Bondy at The Kitchen on 29 January 1989, featuring their exiled saxophonist Vratislav Brabenec and New York musicians including Ed Pastorini, the Soldier String Quartet, Craig Harris, Borbetomagus, Elliott Sharp and Gary Lucas, who played the Plastic People's repertoire. News of the concert in Prague is said to have helped to inspire the Velvet Revolution, a movement strongly influenced by experimental American rock and jazz music.\n\nGiorgio was involved as guide, producer, and supporter to numerous adventurous New York bands including D Generation, 101 Crustaceans, and Band of Susans.\n\nIn 1978, having received a substantial royalty payment for his work with The Yardbirds, Gomelsky relocated to New York in an attempt to open up the American market to the European progressive jazz-rock bands he was working with. He established the Zu Club in Manhattan and after meeting 24-year-old bass player Bill Laswell, encouraged him to form a band, which began rehearsing in the club's basement.\n\nThe band became known as the 'Zu Band' until Gomelsky hooked them up with former Gong frontman Daevid Allen for a performance at his Zu Manifestival at the Zu Club on 8 October 1978 (and for a 24-hour music festival at Entermedia, a performance space on the Upper West Side of Manhattan), for which they became 'New York Gong'. Allen and the band amicably parted company when they \"discovered they couldn't stand the European way of life\" during a tour of France. The band then took the name Material, and their debut recording was 1979's instrumental post-punk industrial funk \"Temporary Music 1\" EP for Gomelsky's Zu Records.\n\n\nGomelsky died of cancer on 13 January 2016 in New York City. He was 81.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50014746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50014746", "title": "Hacknet", "text": "Hacknet\n\nHacknet is a 2015 video game that allows the player to perform simulated computer hacking. \n\nThe game is controlled with a combination of a graphical interface and a text based console. Hacknet simulates the Unix terminal and file system, especially for the player's local machine. It is generally possible to use either interface to perform tasks. The core of the gameplay is to connect to other computers and run dedicated programs to break the security so that you can get superuser privileges on the computer. The general procedure is to first run a scan to see what protections the computer has and then run programs matching what the scan revealed.\n\nThe game notably averts the common trope of bouncing a connection between several intermediary computers before reaching the target computer. Instead a simplified system of a variable speed countdown is used to force the player to act quickly. If this countdown reaches zero, the player is given one last chance to avoid a game over by hacking their ISP and changing their IP address.\n\nOnce superuser privileges have been obtained, the file system of the computer is investigated. The exact task on each computer varies for each mission, but can in general be performed by running a specific command to access one or more files on the system.\n\nA few systems have specialized interfaces, such as email systems and databases.\n\nMost computer systems contain text files that can be read. A large majority of the files are quotes from the website bash.org.\n\nThe game begins with the player being automatically contacted by a user by the username \"Bit\". The automated message tells the player that it was sent in the event of Bit's death and asks that the player investigate his death.\n\nBit then starts to teach you the game mechanics by way of simple missions. Bit will then tell you to join the hacking group Entropy\n\nAfter the tutorial, the story largely takes a back seat for open-ended gameplay, with a mission to address Bit's fate. This mission suggests that Bit was involved in some sort of illegal activity.\n\nOne of the missions the player takes on involves an opposing hacker by the alias of \"Naix\". They take offense to being investigated and attack the player by hacking their system. This attack is nearly impossible to defend against and if successful will result in the game GUI disappearing and the virtual computer rebooting, leaving the player with a minimal console interface. Once the player has recovered their system from the attack, the storyline of the game splits: the player can choose to take revenge on the attacker and as a reward get access to a third faction in the game, or follow the guidance of their mission control and make a statement that such behavior is not acceptable, resulting in the resumption of your missions with the faction you were in (called Entropy) before the attack.\n\nOne late game mission in the game is called \"Project Junebug\". While the player can see it right after joining the hacking group that offers it, the mission will remain locked until all other missions have been taken care of. The mission is a request to provide euthanasia for someone terminally ill by hacking their pacemaker.\n\nAs the final story arc of the game, the player breaks into the computers of a computer security software company, named, \"EnTech\". As they do so, they are faced with a security system that makes computers inviolable to the tools currently at the disposal of the player. As the player manages to find alternative ways into the protected systems, they discover that Bit was involved in a project for the company. Specifically, the creation of a highly advanced operating system specialized in computer hacking. It is revealed that the plan for the project is to unleash the new operating system to the world in order to cause consumer demand for the protection system.\n\nBit in particular was a major contributor. As the project was nearing its completion, Bit was starting to question the morality of the project. A project owner asked an anonymous figure to \"discourage him.\" Due to miscommunication, this led to a hit being put out on Bit, and ending in his assassination, despite the project owners attempts to stop it.\n\nOnce all the facts of the story have been revealed to the player, they proceed to eradicate all copies of the Hacknet project. Additionally, by command of Bit himself, they bring down the server at the heart of Porthack, the tool that Bit made. Once this final mission is completed, Bit delivers a few final, voice acted words and the game credits roll.\n\n\"Hacknet\" was developed by Matt Trobbiani, the sole developer of Team Fractal Alligator, based in Australia.\n\n\"Hacknet\" received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\nGameSpot gave the game an 8/10, praising the game for its unique presentation puzzle design.\n\nA DLC expansion for \"Hacknet\", titled \"Hacknet Labyrinths\" was announced on August 30 2016. The expansion was set to come out December 2016, however, development issues delayed release to March 31, 2017.\n\nThe expansion features new hacking tools and security systems, as well as a 3 to 4 hour chapter to the game, where the player is recruited by a hacker that goes by the alias \"Kaguya\" into a small elite hacking team. It includes more secrets, more UI themes and a full new soundtrack, from artists such as synthwave artist OGRE and Rémi Gallego, creator of metal/electronic act \"The Algorithm\".\n\nIn May 2017, official mod support for \"Hacknet\" titled \"Hacknet Extensions\" was released worldwide, in which players can create their own custom stories and campaigns for the game. These extensions can be shared and downloaded from the Steam Workshop. Extensions are separate from the main game, and are accessed from a separate menu from the title screen.\n\n\"Hacknet Extensions\" also features extension-exclusive tools and the ability to implement custom music and themes.\n"}

The game is played at recess, lunch or before and after school. It can also be played at home or anywhere that has a hard surface and at least one line. It has quick set-up time and simple rules, contributing to its popularity.\nUnlike most types of handball, this version does not incorporate a wall, instead relying on lines on the ground. A typical handball court is a square split into four, usually by painted lines or expansion joints, with the highest and most prestigious position on the court being Ace, followed by King, Queen, then Dunce. The most radical change from American handball is that players must bounce the ball (usually a tennis ball or a high bounce ball) in their own square first, until it is allowed to bounce into another player's square. Each player, if the ball bounces within their square, must then hit the ball with their hand, have it bounce within their own square once, and then an opponent's square. Failure to do so results in the player being relegated to the lowest position on the court, or the last of the players waiting to enter the court.\nDue to the social nature of handball at school and the simplicity of playing, many variations to the rules can occur. For example, one group may play in a square of four while the next school over, the game is played in a straight line of six squares, radically altering the game. In addition, some variations of the game allow for the head or feet to be used to return the ball. As a result, this article only covers the most common rules and is not representative of every variation. In other words, the rules may vary between schools, but basic rules usually remain the same.\n\nThe player is 'out' when they have committed any of the following:\nDue to the rules of handball varying from school to school, the following variations have developed:\n\nLines: depending on the location or age-group, the definition of a 'line' changes and their role in the game also changes. Generally, in younger age groups, if the ball lands on any line separating two opponents on any bounce, it is treated as if it were a line and the point 'replayed'. However, depending on the school or institution, lines can be treated as if they are a part of an opponent's square, thus the game will always continue if the ball hits the line. In instances where the ball may fall on a line separating two squares on the full, the square that the majority of the ball bounces in is consider to be where the ball landed. On the opposite end of the spectrum, some games will deem a ball to be 'out' if it hits any line that does not border another square.\n\nOuts: in some locations, due to surrounding objects, a handball court may 'extend' onto walls, the roof or external objects such as poles, lockers and windows. In this variation, commonly known as 'rebounds', the ball can bounce off, hit or roll along any other surface near the court as long as it is returned to the court. In this game, the ball is only considered to bounce when it hits the floor of a player's square.\n\nGrab: in many establishments, the definition of a 'grab' is hotly debated. In some instances, a grab is considered to be any motion when the ball is held. In others, a grab is outlawed however a 'cradle', a low bouncing shot where the ball is balanced in the palm, is allowed. In some games, especially for lower aged groups, grabbing the ball may be allowed.\n\nInterference: in some versions of the game, interference will resulting in the point being replayed. In other versions a player may commit a 'ghost' without repercussions, where a play attempts to put another player off by moving any part of their body near the ball as the player attempts to hit it.\n\nReadiness of the players: in some games, players must be fully ready before the player in the top square can serve. In other styles, the player must only be in the square to be considered 'ready'. Finally, in some versions a player may serve at any time, as long as they call 'ever-ready' as a warning to players to prepare to commence the point.\n\nServing: In most games, as serve is conducted by the player it the highest square throwing the ball into the other square. In other variations, the player must hit the ball out of their hand to make a serve. It is common in games that a player call 'decent' on a serve that not easy to hit, and the point is retaken.\n\nCherries: in younger age groups, a game may develop where 'fulls' are allowed, to make play easier.\n\nPlaying on: In the majority of games the 'first-fault' style is used, where - when a player gets out and play continues or multiple outs occur - the play is stopped and the first person to get out is deemed to be out. In other games, 'two-play-on-play' is used, where the point may continue if two hits by two other players occur.\n\nEven though each part of the court is referred to as a 'square', a square can be any shape or size. Its edges or 'lines' can be marked with any material, including: paint, expansion joints, cracks, chalk or points where the square meets an object such as a wall or locker. Commonly, the court is either a bitumen or concrete surface. Depending on the school, the squares will either be labelled Ace, King, Queen and Dunce or King, Queen, Jack and Dunce.\nIn popular culture, handball has grown popularity in the current 'meme' culture. In Australia, former prime minister Kevin Rudd released a video in March, 2013 of him playing handball at Brisbane State High School. This triggered a growth of popularity in handball, and lead to him being ingrained into 'handball meme' culture. In late November, 2017, Kevin Rudd played handball with students in a school in Brisbane, and the accompanying video - claiming he is the \"king of handball' - reached 40,000 views on Facebook.\n\nHandball is also the main theme of the children's television series, \"Handball Heroes\", which aired on ABC Me.\n"}

From 1955 to 1962, most of their non-kid comic output was done under the \"Thrill Adventure\" line, under the editorship of Joe Simon, after which they stopped publishing any non-kid comics.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, with the camp craze created by the Batman television series, Harvey approached Joe Simon again to oversee a new line of comics, mainly superheroes, but with science fiction/fantasy stories thrown in as well. They also continued the Thrill Adventures title Warfront, after a 7-year hiatus.\n\nThe line started off with one-shots \"Unearthly Spectaculars\" #1, \"Thrill-O-Rama\" #1, \"Blast-Off\" #1, and \"Warfront\" #36 in October 1965, using work that was apparently done for the 1950s Thrill Adventure line. The next issues would not come out until almost a year later in September 1966. Along with the new titles were two reprint titles for Fighting American and The Spirit, which did include new stories for these characters.

Although virtually all films produced today are made within the IMR, it is not the only possible mode of representation. Other possibilities include the primitive mode of representation, which was dominant before being replaced by the IMR; certain avant-garde films that constitute a “deconstructionist” challenge to the IMR; and various non-western modes, notably pre-war Japanese film, that were possible before the IMR became the worldwide norm. Classical Hollywood cinema is the dominant style within the IMR, but other styles such as art house, independent, and most (current) foreign styles fall no less under the IMR. \n\nThe concept was developed by Noël Burch in his 1969 book \"Praxis du cinéma\". Burch’s goal is to show that the IMR was a class-determined practice, developed out of the bourgeois desire for totalizing illusionistic representation. André Bazin had identified the “myth of total cinema,” or a constant desire to represent reality as completely as possible, which he claimed as the root of cinema innovations (both technology such as sound, color, and widescreen as well as techniques such as more elaborate editing). Burch, on the other hand, argues that IMR is no more elaborate or realistic a system than its alternatives. \n\nThe IMR is characterized by the attempt to create an entirely closed fictional world on screen. The audience is completely imaginatively involved in the film, instead of being distant from it and seeing it as an object to be examined. Burch argues that the key to the IMR is \"spectatorial identification with a ubiquitous camera.\" Various techniques (often referred to as the “language of cinema”) were developed in order to accomplish this identification:\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the summer of 1969, with a band formed at school, he went to London where he met Freddie Bulsara. A few weeks later Bulsara appeared on stage for the first time, fronting the band Testi had taken to London. Bulsara changed the band’s name from Ibex to Wreckage and later changed his own name to Freddie Mercury.\n\nDuring 1970, as a college social secretary, Testi continued to follow Mercury’s progress with Roger Taylor and Brian May in the newly formed Queen and arranged three shows for the band; at a youth club in Potters Bar, at St Helens College of Technology and at Liverpool’s Cavern Club. Testi returned to London and spent 1971 encouraging Queen and generating interest from record companies.\n\nIn mid-1972 Testi returned to Merseyside, working with local musicians until 1974 when he met members of a band from Liverpool College of Art who had taken their name from the building where they rehearsed – Deaf School.

There may be an actual case which inspired the novel.\n\nThe film purportedly takes place in South Africa in the 1960s (unlike the novel which was set in Southern Rhodesia pre-1950). Mary, a city woman, marries a farmer named Dick Turner. Mary leaves the comfortable familiarity of her urban life and goes to live on Dick's struggling farm. Mary has little experience handling Africans as servants or employees and is harsh and tactless in her treatment of the African farm workers. Mary runs away by herself (to the town of Livingstone, crossing the bridge at Victoria Falls by train - which takes her into what was pre-1964 still Northern Rhodesia), only to find that she cannot get her old job back, and has nowhere to take permanent refuge and no means of financial support. She returns to the farm. Mary slowly becomes insane and breaks the Rhodesian taboo of inter-racial over-familiarity with the African houseboy, Moses. After Mary and Moses are accidentally observed by a newly appointed farm manager in the act of taking what would be considered liberties, Dick decides to send Mary away from the farm. Learning of Mary's forthcoming departure, Moses murders Mary during a rainstorm. Moses is arrested by the police and led off in handcuffs. \n\n"}
{"id": "51606865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51606865", "title": "Naam Shabana", "text": "Naam Shabana\n\nNaam Shabana () is a 2017 Indian action spy-thriller film directed by Shivam Nair and produced by Neeraj Pandey and Aruna Bhatia. It is a spin-off from the 2015 film \"Baby\" with Taapsee Pannu reprising her role as Shabana. Akshay Kumar and Prithviraj Sukumaran play important supporting roles in the film. The film is dubbed into Telugu and Tamil languages and was released on 31 March 2017. The Tamil title was ‘Naanthan Shabana’. One day after its release in Pakistan the film was banned in the country for being an Indian perspective.\n\nThe film begins with two Indian agents working under Ranvir Singh (Manoj Bajpai) chasing an international arms dealer Mikhail (Prithviraj Sukumaran), who has been on the radar of several intelligence agencies, but instead he kills them both and escapes. A year later Shabana Khan (Taapsee Pannu) a college student who is also a Judo fighter is being followed by Indian agency as a potential recruit. One of Shabana's friends, Jai (Taher Shabbir) who likes Shabana, and always tries to hit on her, asks her on a date a day before his birthday, she agrees to go with him on the date and there he confesses his love for her. During the date he asks her about her past, and Shabana tells him that she had been kept in juvenile detention for killing her abusive father who used to physically assault her mother. During their bike ride home Shabana is a victim of eve teasing from a group of four drunk men in a Jeep, with the exchange turning into a physical altercation resulting in Jai getting killed and the assailants running away. Soon after, Shabana receives a call from an unknown number asking if she wants to avenge her lover's death. The unknown caller agrees to help her terminate the killer in exchange for Shabana joining a secret agency. Shabana agrees to this and accordingly receives information on the killer's whereabouts, and the agents aid her in killing them. Shabana then goes to Goa, to the same hotel where the main culprit who killed Jai was staying. As instructed, Shabana enters his room killing him and later escapes with the help of Ajay Singh (Akshay Kumar). The unknown caller is then revealed to be agent Ranvir Singh.\n\nFollowing this Shabana is recruited into the secret agency on a trial basis, wherein she is receives extensive training in physical fitness and fighting techniques. The story then focuses on global arms dealer and supplier Mikhail. Three Indian agents then track down Tony, Mikhail's right hand. During interrogation Tony tips them off as to the identity of a German doctor who has surgically changed Mikhail's face. By the time the agency contacts the doctor to find out how Mikhail looks now Tony kills all three agents and escapes, revealing that he himself is Mikhail. Ranvir Singh gets the tip that Mikhail is planning another plastic surgery to change his face. This time Shabana is sent to kill Mikhail with the help of Ajay Singh and Om Prakash Shukla (Anupam Kher). Shabana enters the adjacent operation theater disguised as a patient, and after getting rid of Mikhail's private security is about to kill Mikhail in the operating theater. To her surprise he is awake as he had refused to take general anesthesia during the operation. After quite a tussle, where Mikhail almost strangles Shabana, she finally manages to kill Mikhail and once again escape from the police with the help of Ajay.\n\n\nTaapsee Pannu was trained in mixed martial arts and Judo along with Krav Maga for her role in the film. In October 2016, Prithviraj Sukumaran joined the cast of the film and had shot for a cameo role. Akshay Kumar was signed to play an extended cameo in the film, reprising his role from the previous film. Anupam Kher was signed to play the role of a technical agent. French stuntman Cyril Raffaelli was signed to choreograph the stunts of the film. For the preparation of the role of Pannu's character as a spy, producer Neeraj Pandey took guidance from full-time consultant, an ex-intelligence officer.\nVarun Dhawan was also rumored to be a part of the film, however the actor claimed later that he is not the part of the film.\n\nPrincipal photography of the film's first schedule began on September 2016 in Malaysia, where Kumar and Pannu shot for stunt sequences. Filming of the first schedule was completed in late October 2016. The film's second schedule was started on November 2016 in Mumbai. The shooting of the film was wrapped up in February 2017.\n\nThe film was produced on a budget of 15 crore. Its first day gross was approximately 5.12 crore, and the film finished its first weekend with an estimated gross of 18.76 crore.\n\nThe songs of the film are composed by Rochak Kohli and Meet Bros. Lyrics are written by Manoj Muntashir and Kumaar and released by T-Series. The film score is composed by Sanjoy Chowdhury.\n\nShubhra Gupta of \"The Indian Express\" wrote, \"What does come as a surprise, however, is just how much of a drag the film is. Except for a few stray sequences in which the limber Taapsee Pannu goes after the bad guys, and the ones in which co-star Akshay Kumar moves in to demonstrate how the big boys do it, there is nothing either novel or interesting about the film.\"\n\nOn April 9, 2017 the film was banned in Pakistan by its Central Board of Film Censors. It had been shown in Pakistan starting on March 31, 2017 as long as certain scenes with a terrorism theme were cut. One day after an Islamabad theatre showed an uncut version the film was banned from all theatres in the country.\n\n\n"}

The episode was based on a premise by James Swallow, based on an invitation to pitch after he submitted a spec script.\n\nThe crew of \"Voyager\" reaches a Mutara-class nebula in their path towards home. As they start to enter it, the entire crew begins to suffer from intense pain, and one crewmember dies from burns on his skin; only Seven of Nine is unaffected. Realizing that they cannot withstand the subatomic radiation emanating from the nebula for the month it would take to cross, they consider travelling around it, which would take an additional year to clear. The Doctor proposes a novel solution: to place the crew, save for himself and Seven, in stasis, allowing them to cross the nebula safely. Captain Janeway agrees, and soon, the crew is safely stowed into stasis chambers.\n\nSeven adopts a daily cycle to assure the ship maintains its course and the crew remains healthy while in stasis, at times dealing with Tom Paris's fear of small spaces and placing him back in stasis with the Doctor's help. The Doctor attempts to engage Seven in human activities such as a holodeck party with the virtualized crew, but Seven continues to try to keep working during these times. Suddenly, the computer reports failure in the anti-matter storage tanks, but when Seven arrives in engineering to eject them, there is no sign of problems. They discover the gel packs are starting to fail due to the nebula's radiation, but are able to reroute the computer processor to avoid these faults. The Doctor discovers his mobile emitter has started to fail as well, and is forced to stay in sickbay until the journey is complete.\n\nAs the ship nears the edge of the nebula, Seven becomes concerned she is feeling the effects of prolonged isolation, experiencing disturbing dreams and hallucinations. Another ship appears, helmed by Trajis Lo-Tarik, looking for supplies. Seven brings him aboard and provides him with the requested equipment, but when she is struck by another hallucination, Trajis disappears. She warns the Doctor of the intruder on board and attempts to locate Trajis, who seems intent on destroying \"Voyager\". Seven continues to suffer intense hallucinations, including Harry Kim and Tom Paris bursting into flames. The Doctor hot-wires his mobile emitter to try to help Seven, assuring her there is no one else on board, before his emitter dies out. As the hallucinations worsen for Seven, she finds that the ship's propulsion system is failing. Knowing that the ship must clear the nebula, she opts to route power from life support while maintaining the stasis chambers, eventually passing out.\n\nSeven regains consciousness in sickbay, surrounded by Janeway, the Doctor, and other crew members. They congratulate her on successfully getting the ship out of the nebula, and that all has been returned to normal. Later, Seven observes Paris, Kim, and Torres at the mess hall. She asks to join them, feeling the need for companionship after her ordeal, and they invite her to sit down.\n\n"}
{"id": "167975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167975", "title": "Peter Ustinov", "text": "Peter Ustinov\n\nSir Peter Alexander Ustinov, ( or ; 16 April 192128 March 2004), was an English actor, voice actor, writer, dramatist, filmmaker, theatre and opera director, stage designer, screenwriter, comedian, humourist, newspaper and magazine columnist, radio broadcaster and television presenter. He was a fixture on television talk shows and lecture circuits for much of his career. An intellectual and diplomat, he held various academic posts and served as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF and President of the World Federalist Movement.\n\nUstinov was the winner of numerous awards over his life, including two Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor, Emmy Awards, Golden Globes and BAFTA Awards for acting and a Grammy Award for best recording for children, as well as the recipient of governmental honours from, amongst others, the United Kingdom, France and Germany. He displayed a unique cultural versatility that has frequently earned him the accolade of a Renaissance man. Miklós Rózsa, composer of the music for \"Quo Vadis\" and of numerous concert works, dedicated his String Quartet No. 1, Op. 22 (1950) to Ustinov.\n\nIn 2003, Durham University changed the name of its Graduate Society to Ustinov College in honour of the significant contributions Ustinov had made as chancellor of the university from 1992 until his death.\n\nPeter Alexander \"Freiherr\" von Ustinov was born in London, England. His father, Jona \"Freiherr\" von Ustinov, was of Russian, Polish Jewish, German and Ethiopian descent. Peter's paternal grandfather was Baron Plato von Ustinov, a Russian noble, and his grandmother was Magdalena Hall, of mixed Ethiopian-German-Jewish origin. Peter's paternal great-great-grandparents (through Magdalena's mother) were the German painter Eduard Zander and the Ethiopian aristocrat Court-Lady Isette-Werq in Gondar.\n\nUstinov's mother, Nadezhda Leontievna Benois, known as Nadia, was a painter and ballet designer of French, German, Italian and Russian descent. Her father, Leon Benois, was an Imperial Russian architect and owner of Leonardo da Vinci's painting \"Madonna Benois\". Leon's brother Alexandre Benois was a stage designer who worked with Stravinsky and Diaghilev. Their paternal ancestor Jules-César Benois was a chef who had left France for St. Petersburg during the French Revolution and became a chef to Emperor Paul I of Russia.\n\nJona (or Iona) worked as a press officer at the German Embassy in London in the 1930s and was a reporter for a German news agency. In 1935, two years after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Jona von Ustinov began working for the British intelligence service MI5 and became a British citizen, thus avoiding internment during the war. He was the controller of Wolfgang Gans zu Putlitz, an MI5 spy in the German embassy in London who furnished information on Hitler's intentions before the Second World War. (Peter Wright mentions in his book \"Spycatcher\" that Jona was possibly the spy known as U35; Ustinov says in his autobiography that his father hosted secret meetings of senior British and German officials at their London home.) Ustinov's great-grandfather Moritz Hall, a Jewish refugee from Kraków and later a Christian convert and collaborator of Swiss and German missionaries in Ethiopia, married into a German-Ethiopian family.\n\nUstinov was educated at Westminster School and had a difficult childhood because of his parents' constant fighting. One of his schoolmates was Rudolf von Ribbentrop, the eldest son of the Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. While at school, Ustinov considered anglicising his name to \"Peter Austin\" but was counselled against it by a fellow pupil who said that he should \"Drop the 'von' but keep the 'Ustinov'\". After training as an actor in his late teens, along with early attempts at playwriting, he made his stage début in 1938 at the Players' Theatre, becoming quickly established. He later wrote, \"I was not irresistibly drawn to the drama. It was an escape road from the dismal rat race of school\".\n\nIn 1939, he appeared in \"White Cargo\" at the Aylesbury Rep, where he performed in a different accent every night. Ustinov served as a private in the British Army during the Second World War, including time spent as batman to David Niven while writing the Niven film \"The Way Ahead\". The difference in their ranksNiven was a lieutenant-colonel and Ustinov a privatemade their regular association militarily impossible; to solve the problem, Ustinov was appointed as Niven's batman. He also appeared in propaganda films, debuting in \"One of Our Aircraft Is Missing\" (1942), in which he was required to deliver lines in English, Latin and Dutch. In 1944, under the auspices of ENSA, he presented and performed the role of Sir Anthony Absolute, in Sheridan's \"The Rivals\", with Dame Edith Evans, at the Larkhill Camp theater.\n\nAfter the war, he began writing; his first major success was with the play \"The Love of Four Colonels\" (1951). He starred with Humphrey Bogart and Aldo Ray in \"We're No Angels\" (1955). His career as a dramatist continued, his best-known play being \"Romanoff and Juliet\" (1956). His film roles include Roman emperor Nero in \"Quo Vadis\" (1951), Lentulus Batiatus in \"Spartacus\" (1960), Captain Vere in \"Billy Budd\" (1962) and an old man surviving a totalitarian future in \"Logan's Run\" (1976). Ustinov voiced the anthropomorphic lions Prince John and King Richard in the 1973 Disney animated film \"Robin Hood\". He also worked on several films as writer and occasionally director, including \"The Way Ahead\" (1944), \"School for Secrets\" (1946), \"Hot Millions\" (1968) and \"Memed, My Hawk\" (1984).\nIn half a dozen films, he played Agatha Christie's detective Hercule Poirot, first in \"Death on the Nile\" (1978) and then in 1982's \"Evil Under the Sun\", 1985's \"Thirteen at Dinner\" (TV movie), 1986's \"Dead Man's Folly\" (TV movie), 1986's \"Murder in Three Acts\" (TV movie) and 1988's \"Appointment with Death\".\nUstinov won Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor for his roles in \"Spartacus\" (1960) and \"Topkapi\" (1964). He also won a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor for the film \"Quo Vadis\" (he set the Oscar and Globe statuettes up on his desk as if playing doubles tennis; the game was a love of his life, as was ocean yachting). Ustinov was also the winner of three Emmys and one Grammy and was nominated for two Tony Awards.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1955, he starred with Peter Jones in the BBC radio comedy \"In All Directions\". The series featured Ustinov and Jones as themselves in a London car journey perpetually searching for Copthorne Avenue. The comedy derived from the characters they met, whom they often also portrayed. The show was unusual for the time, as it was improvised rather than scripted. Ustinov and Jones improvised on a tape, which was difficult and then edited for broadcast by Frank Muir and Denis Norden, who also sometimes took part.\n\nDuring the 1960s, with the encouragement of Sir Georg Solti, Ustinov directed several operas, including Puccini's \"Gianni Schicchi\", Ravel's \"L'heure espagnole\", Schoenberg's \"Erwartung\" and Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\". Further demonstrating his great talent and versatility in the theatre, Ustinov later undertook set and costume design for \"Don Giovanni\".\n\nHis autobiography, \"Dear Me\" (1977), was well received and had him describe his life (ostensibly his childhood) while being interrogated by his own ego, with forays into philosophy, theatre, fame and self-realisation. From 1969 until his death, his acting and writing took second place to his work on behalf of UNICEF, for which he was a Goodwill Ambassador and fundraiser. In this role, he visited some of the neediest children and made use of his ability to make people laugh, including many of the world's most disadvantaged children. \"Sir Peter could make anyone laugh\", UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy is quoted as saying. On 31 October 1984, Ustinov was due to interview Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi for Irish television. She was assassinated on her way to the meeting.\nUstinov also served as President of the World Federalist Movement from 1991 until his death. He once said, \"World government is not only possible, it is inevitable, and when it comes, it will appeal to patriotism in its truest, in its only sense, the patriotism of men who love their national heritages so deeply that they wish to preserve them in safety for the common good\".\n\nHe was a frequent guest of Jack Paar's \"Tonight Show\" in the early 1960s and was a guest on the \"upside down\" episode of the American talk show \"Late Night\", during which the camera, mounted on a slowly revolving wheel, gradually rotated the picture 360° during the course of an hour; Ustinov appeared midway through and was photographed upside down in close-up as he spoke while his host appeared only in long shots. Towards the end of Ustinov's life, he undertook some one-man stage shows in which he let loose his raconteur streak: he told the story of his life, including some moments of tension with the society into which he was born. For example, he took a test as a child, asking him to name a Russian composer; he wrote Rimsky-Korsakov but was marked down. He was then told the correct answer, Tchaikovsky, since he had been studying him in class and was told to stop showing off.\n\nHe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" on two occasions: in November 1977 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Pinewood Studios on the set of \"Death on the Nile\" and a week before, he was surprised at a book signing at book printers Butler and Tanner in Frome, Somerset. This footage was not used, as Ustinov flatly refused to take part and swore at Andrews. His wife persuaded him to change his mind. He was surprised again in December 1994, when Michael Aspel approached him at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva.\n\nA car enthusiast since the age of four, he owned a succession of interesting machines ranging from a Fiat Topolino, several Lancias, a Hispano-Suiza, a preselector gearbox Delage and a special-bodied Jowett Jupiter. He made records like Phoney Folklore that included the song of the Russian peasant \"whose tractor had betrayed him\" and his \"Grand Prix of Gibraltar\" was a vehicle for his creative wit and ability at car-engine sound effects and voices.\n\nHe spoke English, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Russian fluently, as well as some Turkish and modern Greek. He was proficient in accents and dialects in all his languages. Ustinov provided his own German and French dubbing for some of his roles, both for Lorenzo's Oil. As Hercule Poirot, he provided his own voice for the French versions of Thirteen at Dinner, Dead Man's Folly, Murder in Three Acts, Appointment with Death and Evil under the Sun but unlike Jane Birkin, who had dubbed herself in French for this film and Death on the Nile, Ustinov did not provide his voice for the latter (his French voice being provided by Roger Carel, who had already dubbed him in Spartacus and other films). He dubbed himself in German as Poirot only in Evil under the Sun (his other Poirot roles being undertaken by three actors). On the other hand, he provided only his English and German voice for Disney's Robin Hood and NBC's Alice in Wonderland.\nIn the 1960s, he became a Swiss resident to avoid the British tax system, which heavily taxed the earnings of the wealthy. He was knighted in 1990 and was appointed chancellor of Durham University in 1992, having previously been elected as the first rector of the University of Dundee in 1968 (a role in which he moved from being merely a figurehead to taking on a political role, negotiating with militant students). Ustinov was re-elected to the post for a second three-year term in 1971, narrowly beating Michael Parkinson after a disputed recount. He received an honorary doctorate from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Belgium).\n\nUstinov was a frequent defender of the Chinese government, stating in an address to Durham University in 2000, \"People are annoyed with the Chinese for not respecting more human rights. But with a population that size it's very difficult to have the same attitude to human rights.\" In 2003, Durham's postgraduate college (previously known as the Graduate Society) was renamed Ustinov College. Ustinov went to Berlin on a UNICEF mission in 2002 to visit the circle of United Buddy Bears that promote a more peaceful world between nations, cultures and religions for the first time. He was determined to ensure that Iraq would also be represented in this circle of about 140 countries. Ustinov also presented and narrated the official video review of the 1987 Formula One season and narrated the documentary series \"Wings of the Red Star\". In 1988, he hosted a live television broadcast entitled \"The Secret Identity of Jack the Ripper\". Ustinov gave his name to the Foundation of the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for their Sir Peter Ustinov Television Scriptwriting Award, given annually to a young television screenwriter.\n\nUstinov was married three times—first to Isolde Denham (1920–1987), daughter of Reginald Denham and Moyna Macgill. The marriage lasted from 1940 to their divorce in 1950, and they had one child, daughter Tamara Ustinov. Isolde was the half-sister of Angela Lansbury, who appeared with Ustinov in \"Death on the Nile\". His second marriage was to Suzanne Cloutier, which lasted from 1954 to their divorce in 1971. They had three children, two daughters, Pavla Ustinov and Andrea Ustinov, and a son, Igor Ustinov. His third marriage was to Helene du Lau d'Allemans, which lasted from 1972 to his death in 2004.\n\nUstinov was a secular humanist. He was listed as a distinguished supporter of the British Humanist Association, and had once served on their advisory council.\n\nUstinov suffered from diabetes and a weakened heart in his last years.\n\nUstinov died on 28 March 2004 of heart failure in a clinic in Genolier, near his home in Bursins, Vaud, Switzerland. He was so well regarded as a goodwill ambassador that UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy spoke at his funeral and represented United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\n\nUstinov was the President of the World Federalist Movement from 1991 to 2004, the time of his death. WFM is a global NGO that promotes the concept of global democratic institutions. WFM lobbies those in powerful positions to establish a unified human government based on democracy and civil society. The United Nations and other world agencies would become the institutions of a World Federation. The UN would be the federal government and nation states would become similar to provinces.\n\nUntil his death, Ustinov was a member of English PEN, part of the PEN International network that campaigns for freedom of expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUstinov received many honorary degrees for his work.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14548327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14548327", "title": "Prostitution in Paraguay", "text": "Prostitution in Paraguay\n\nProstitution in Paraguay is legal for persons over the age of 18, but related activities such as brothel keeping are prohibited. Prostitution is common in the country. Brothels are also common, even some rural villages have a small bar/brothel on the outskirts.\n\nWhilst there is no red-light district in the capital, Asunción, street prostitution is widespread in the city centre,especially around Plaza Uruguaya. Brothels are also common in the city centre. Prostitutes can also be found in bars and discos.\n\nThere are about 30 \"motels\" in and around the city that cater for illicit sex. Rented by the hour, the suites are approached through a garage so people can't be seen entering or leaving. Any refreshments required are ordered by telephone and delivered through a flap in the door, payment is also made through the flap. The staff never see the guests.\n\nAfter the Paraguayan War (1864 to 1870), Asunción was occupied by troops from Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Many women turned to prostitution. An unfinished theatre was converted into a brothel where 400 women worked and lived. When the occupying troops withdrew from the city, the Argentinian National Guard took 300 prostitutes back to Buenos Aires with them. In an attempt to 'clean up' the city, the authorities shipped many prostitutes to rural areas of the country.\n\nHIV is a problem in the country and sex workers are a high group. Since 1995 the government has been running a scheme for sex workers as part of their \"Struggle Against AIDS\" campaign. Social and health workers offer support, information, free testing and distribute condoms. There is a reluctance to use condoms in the country, partially due to the Catholic Church's opposition. Some clients offer to pay more for sex without a condom.\n\nIn 2016, UNAIDS estimated the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers to be 7%.\n\nChild prostitution is a problem. Poor children are trafficked from rural areas to urban centers such as Asunción, Ciudad del Este, and\nEncarnación for commercial sexual exploitation. Street children and working children are common targets for trafficking recruiters. \n\nIn 2002, the International Labour Organisation’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour found that in Ciudad del Este, 250 of the 650 sex workers in the streets were underage. A 2005 study by United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimated two out of three sex workers were underage girls. Many NGOs and international organisations are working to alleviate the problem.\n\nParaguay is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Paraguayan women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking within the country, and transgender Paraguayans are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Thousands of Paraguayan children work as domestic servants in exchange for food, board, and occasionally education or a small stipend in a system called criadazgo; many of these children are subjected to domestic servitude and are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Indigenous persons are particularly at risk for sex trafficking. In 2015, authorities reported at least 24 Paraguayan women were recruited for work in Turkey and later exploited in forced prostitution in brothels throughout Turkey, Spain, and the northern area of Cyprus administered by Turkish Cypriots. The reliance of international trafficking rings on local recruiters remains a problem. Traffickers offer victims their freedom or pardon of debts if they recruit other victims and often rely on social media outlets as recruiting tools. Foreign victims of sex trafficking in Paraguay are mostly from other South American countries. Paraguayan victims of sex trafficking are found in Argentina, Spain, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, China, Colombia, and other countries. Paraguayan women are recruited as couriers of illicit narcotics to Europe and Africa, where they are subjected to forced prostitution. \n\nNGOs and authorities reported government officials, including police, border guards, judges, and public registry employees, facilitated human trafficking, including by taking bribes from brothel owners in exchange for protection, extorting suspected traffickers in order to prevent arrest, and producing fraudulent identity documents. \n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranked Paraguay as a Tier 2 country.\n\n"}

{"id": "28833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28833", "title": "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight", "text": "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\n\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight (Middle English: \"Sir Gawayn and þe Grene Knyȝt\") is a late 14th-century Middle English chivalric romance. It is one of the best known Arthurian stories, with its plot combining two types of folklore motifs, the beheading game and the exchange of winnings. Written in stanzas of alliterative verse, each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel, it draws on Welsh, Irish, and English stories, as well as the French chivalric tradition. It is an important example of a chivalric romance, which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess, and it remains popular to this day in modern English renderings from J. R. R. Tolkien, Simon Armitage, and others, as well as through film and stage adaptations.\n\nIt describes how Sir Gawain, a knight of King Arthur's Round Table, accepts a challenge from a mysterious \"Green Knight\" who challenges any knight to strike him with his axe if he will take a return blow in a year and a day. Gawain accepts and beheads him with his blow, at which the Green Knight stands up, picks up his head and reminds Gawain of the appointed time. In his struggles to keep his bargain, Gawain demonstrates chivalry and loyalty until his honour is called into question by a test involving Lady Bertilak, the lady of the Green Knight's castle.\n\nThe poem survives in a single manuscript, the \"Cotton Nero A.x.\", which also includes three religious narrative poems: \"Pearl\", \"Purity\" and \"Patience\". All are thought to have been written by the same unknown author, dubbed the \"Pearl Poet\" or \"Gawain Poet\", since all four are written in a North West Midland dialect of Middle English.\n\nIn Camelot on New Year's Day, King Arthur's court is exchanging gifts and waiting for the feasting to start when the king asks first to see or hear of an exciting adventure. A gigantic figure, entirely green in appearance and riding a green horse, rides unexpectedly into the hall. He wears no armour but bears an axe in one hand and a holly bough in the other. Refusing to fight anyone there on the grounds that they are all too weak to take him on, he insists he has come for a friendly \"Christmas game\": someone is to strike him once with his axe on condition that the Green Knight may return the blow in a year and a day. The splendid axe will belong to whoever takes him on. Arthur himself is prepared to accept the challenge when it appears no other knight will dare, but Sir Gawain, youngest of Arthur's knights and his nephew, begs for the honour instead. The giant bends and bares his neck before him and Gawain neatly beheads him in one stroke. However, the Green Knight neither falls nor falters, but instead reaches out, picks up his severed head and remounts, holding up his bleeding head to Queen Guinevere while its writhing lips remind Gawain that the two must meet again at the Green Chapel. He then rides away. Gawain and Arthur admire the axe, hang it up as a trophy and encourage Guinevere to treat the whole matter lightly.\n\nAs the date approaches, Sir Gawain sets off to find the Green Chapel and keep his side of the bargain. Many adventures and battles are alluded to (but not described) until Gawain comes across a splendid castle where he meets Bertilak de Hautdesert, the lord of the castle, and his beautiful wife, who are pleased to have such a renowned guest. Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel and that he only has a few days remaining. Bertilak laughs, explains that the start of the path that will take him to the Green Chapel is less than two miles away and proposes that Gawain rest at the castle till then. Relieved and grateful, Gawain agrees.\n\nBefore going hunting the next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain whatever he catches on the condition that Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die the next day, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.\n\nThe next day, Gawain binds the belt twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight sharpening an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch with the second swing; but again the Green Knight withholds the full force of his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.\n\nThough the real name of \"The \"Gawain\" Poet\" (or poets) is unknown, some inferences about him can be drawn from an informed reading of his works. The manuscript of \"Gawain\" is known in academic circles as \"Cotton Nero A.x.\", following a naming system used by one of its owners, Robert Cotton, a collector of Medieval English texts. Before the \"Gawain\" manuscript came into Cotton's possession, it was in the library of Henry Savile in Yorkshire. Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of Thomas Warton's \"History\" edited by Richard Price, it was almost entirely unknown. Even then, the \"Gawain\" poem was not published in its entirety until 1839. Now held in the British Library, it has been dated to the late 14th century, meaning the poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, author of \"The Canterbury Tales\", though it is unlikely that they ever met. The three other works found in the same manuscript as \"Gawain\" (commonly known as \"Pearl\", \"Patience\", and \"Purity\" or \"Cleanliness\") are often considered to be written by the same author. However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single authorship.\n\nWhat is known today about the poet is largely general. As J. R. R. Tolkien and E. V. Gordon, after reviewing the text's allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:\nThe most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire. He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Pearl Poet and is thought to have written the poem \"St. Erkenwald\", which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to \"Gawain\". \"St. Erkenwald\", however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.\n\nThe 2,530 lines and 101 stanzas that make up \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" are written in what linguists call the \"Alliterative Revival\" style typical of the 14th century. Instead of focusing on a metrical syllabic count and rhyme, the alliterative form of this period usually relied on the agreement of a pair of stressed syllables at the beginning of the line and another pair at the end. Each line always includes a pause, called a \"caesura\", at some point after the first two stresses, dividing it into two half-lines. Although he largely follows the form of his day, the Gawain poet was somewhat freer with convention than his or her predecessors. The poet broke the alliterative lines into variable-length groups and ended these nominal stanzas with a rhyming section of five lines known as the \"bob and wheel\", in which the \"bob\" is a very short line, sometimes of only two syllables, followed by the \"wheel,\" longer lines with internal rhyme.\n\nThe earliest known story to feature a beheading game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale \"Bricriu's Feast\". This story parallels \"Gawain\" in that, like the Green Knight, Cú Chulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also appears in the late 12th-century \"Life of Caradoc\", a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' \"Perceval, the Story of the Grail\". A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century \"Perlesvaus\", in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing to come to the same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.\n\nThe stories \"The Girl with the Mule\" (alternately titled \"The Mule Without a Bridle\") and \"Hunbaut\" feature Gawain in beheading game situations. In \"Hunbaut,\" Gawain cuts off a man's head and, before he can replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle to stave off the advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include \"Yder\", the Lancelot-Grail, \"Hunbaut\", and \"The Knight of the Sword\". The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested to see whether or not he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.\n\nIn the first branch of the medieval Welsh collection of tales known as the \"Mabinogion\", Pwyll exchanges places for a year with Arawn, the lord of Annwn (the Otherworld). Despite having his appearance changed to resemble Arawn exactly, Pwyll does not have sexual relations with Arawn's wife during this time, thus establishing a lasting friendship between the two men. This story may, then, provide a background to Gawain's attempts to resist the wife of the Green Knight; thus, the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight may be seen as a tale which combines elements of the Celtic beheading game and seduction test stories. Additionally, in both stories a year passes before the completion of the conclusion of the challenge or exchange. Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, as Arawn seems to have accepted the notion that Pwyll may reciprocate with his wife, making it less of a \"seduction test\" per se, as seduction tests typically involve a Lord and Lady conspiring to seduce a knight, seemingly \"against\" the wishes of the Lord.\n\nAfter the writing of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", several similar stories followed. \"The Greene Knight\" (15th–17th century) is a rhymed retelling of nearly the same tale. In it, the plot is simplified, motives are more fully explained, and some names are changed. Another story, \"The Turke and Gowin\" (15th century), begins with a Turk entering Arthur's court and asking, \"Is there any will, as a brother, To give a buffett and take another?\" At the end of this poem the Turk, rather than buffeting Gawain back, asks the knight to cut off his head, which Gawain does. The Turk then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. \"The Carle of Carlisle\" (17th century) also resembles \"Gawain\" in a scene in which the Carle (Churl), a lord, takes Sir Gawain to a chamber where two swords are hanging and orders Gawain to cut off his head or suffer his own to be cut off. Gawain obliges and strikes, but the Carle rises, laughing and unharmed. Unlike the \"Gawain\" poem, no return blow is demanded or given.\n\nAt the heart of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" is the test of Gawain's adherence to the code of chivalry. The typical temptation fable of medieval literature presents a series of tribulations assembled as tests or \"proofs\" of moral virtue. The stories often describe several individuals' failures after which the main character is tested. Success in the proofs will often bring immunity or good fortune. Gawain's ability to pass the tests of his host are of utmost importance to his survival, though he does not know it. It is only by fortuity or \"instinctive-courtesy\" that Sir Gawain is able to pass his test. Gawain does not realize, however, that these tests are all orchestrated by Sir Bertilak.\nIn addition to the laws of chivalry, Gawain must respect another set of laws concerning courtly love. The knight's code of honour requires him to do whatever a damsel asks. Gawain must accept the girdle from the Lady, but he must also keep the promise he has made to his host that he will give whatever he gains that day. Gawain chooses to keep the girdle out of fear of death, thus breaking his promise to the host but honouring the lady. Upon learning that the Green Knight is actually his host (Bertilak), he realises that although he has completed his quest, he has failed to be virtuous. This test demonstrates the conflict between honour and knightly duties. In breaking his promise, Gawain believes he has lost his honour and failed in his duties.\n\nScholars have frequently noted the parallels between the three hunting scenes and the three seduction scenes in \"Gawain\". They are generally agreed that the fox chase has significant parallels to the third seduction scene, in which Gawain accepts the girdle from Bertilak's wife. Gawain, like the fox, fears for his life and is looking for a way to avoid death from the Green Knight's axe. Like his counterpart, he resorts to trickery in order to save his skin. The fox uses tactics so unlike the first two animals, and so unexpectedly, that Bertilak has the hardest time hunting it. Similarly, Gawain finds the Lady's advances in the third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts. She changes her evasive language, typical of courtly love relationships, to a more assertive style. Her dress, relatively modest in earlier scenes, is suddenly voluptuous and revealing.\n\nThe deer- and boar-hunting scenes are less clearly connected, although scholars have attempted to link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, had to be done according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing the deer hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.\n\nThe boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, laden with detail. Boars were (and are) much more difficult to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak with his back to the ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.\nMasculinity has also been associated with hunting. The theme of masculinity is present throughout. In an article by Vern L. Bullough, \"Being a Male in the Middle Ages,\" he discusses Sir Gawain and how normally, masculinity is often viewed in terms of being sexually active. He notes that Sir Gawain is not part of this normalcy.\n\nSome argue that nature represents a chaotic, lawless order which is in direct confrontation with the civilisation of Camelot throughout \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". The green horse and rider that first invade Arthur’s peaceful halls are iconic representations of nature's disturbance. Nature is presented throughout the poem as rough and indifferent, constantly threatening the order of men and courtly life. Nature invades and disrupts order in the major events of the narrative, both symbolically and through the inner nature of humanity. This element appears first with the disruption caused by the Green Knight, later when Gawain must fight off his natural lust for Bertilak’s wife, and again when Gawain breaks his vow to Bertilak by choosing to keep the green girdle, valuing survival over virtue. Represented by the sin-stained girdle, nature is an underlying force, forever within man and keeping him imperfect (in a chivalric sense). In this view, Gawain is part of a wider conflict between nature and chivalry, an examination of the ability of man's order to overcome the chaos of nature.\n\nSeveral critics have made exactly the opposite interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature and the female. The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of the ideals of the Round Table, and, for the sake of realism and wholeness, recognize and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.\n\nThe chivalry that is represented within 'Gawain' is one which was constructed by court nobility. The violence that is part of this chivalry is steeply contrasted by the fact that King Arthur's court is Christian and the initial beheading event takes place while celebrating Christmas. The violence of an act of beheading seems to be counterintuitive to chivalric and Christian ideals, and yet it is seen as part of knighthood.\n\nThe question of politeness and chivalry is a main theme during Gawain's interactions with Bertilak's wife. He cannot accept her advances or else lose his honour, and yet he cannot utterly refuse her advances or else risk upsetting his hostess. Gawain plays a very fine line and the only part where he appears to fail is when he conceals the green girdle from Bertilak.\n\nThe word \"gomen\" (game) is found 18 times in \"Gawain\". Its similarity to the word \"gome\" (man), which appears 21 times, has led some scholars to see men and games as centrally linked. Games at this time were seen as tests of worthiness, as when the Green Knight challenges the court's right to its good name in a \"Christmas game\". The \"game\" of exchanging gifts was common in Germanic cultures. If a man received a gift, he was obliged to provide the giver with a better gift or risk losing his honour, almost like an exchange of blows in a fight (or in a \"beheading game\"). The poem revolves around two games: an exchange of beheading and an exchange of winnings. These appear at first to be unconnected. However, a victory in the first game will lead to a victory in the second. Elements of both games appear in other stories; however, the linkage of outcomes is unique to \"Gawain\".\n\nTimes, dates, seasons, and cycles within \"Gawain\" are often noted by scholars because of their symbolic nature. The story starts on New Year's Eve with a beheading and culminates on the next New Year's Day. Gawain leaves Camelot on All Saints Day and arrives at Bertilak's castle on Christmas Eve. Furthermore, the Green Knight tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel in \"a year and a day\"—a period of time seen often in medieval literature. Some scholars interpret the yearly cycles, each beginning and ending in winter, as the poet's attempt to convey the inevitable fall of all things good and noble in the world. Such a theme is strengthened by the image of Troy, a powerful nation once thought to be invincible which, according to the \"Aeneid\", fell to the Greeks due to pride and ignorance. The Trojan connection shows itself in the presence of two virtually identical descriptions of Troy's destruction. The poem's first line reads: \"Since the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy\" and the final stanzaic line (before the bob and wheel) is \"After the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy\".\n\nThe entire 'Gawain' poem follows one individual experiencing highly emotional situations. He participates in the beheading contest, watches as a man he has beheaded walks away unscathed, prepares for a journey where he will then also receive a blow that will behead him, is tempted by the sexual advances of Sir Bertilak's wife, decides what to do with the moral conundrum that is the girdle, suffering humiliation, and returning to court to retell his entire adventure. These events invite the reader to empathize with Gawain, the flawed hero, and understand that he is also human.\n\nHumans experience an emotional contagion, which was defined by psychologists Elaine Hatfield, John Cacioppo, and Richard Rapson as 'the tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of another person, and, consequently, to converge emotionally.' Amy Coplan explains that emotional contagion is something that happens so quickly and automatically that we are typically unaware of it happening. The poet capitalized on this emotional reaction and thus has the reader empathizing with Sir Gawain almost without realizing it.\n\nGiven the varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In English folklore and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man. Because of its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified witchcraft, devilry and evil. It can also represent decay and toxicity. When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the girdle, green was often seen as representing youth's passing. In Celtic mythology, green was associated with misfortune and death, and therefore avoided in clothing. The green girdle, originally worn for protection, became a symbol of shame and cowardice; it is finally adopted as a symbol of honour by the knights of Camelot, signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green.\n\nScholars have puzzled over the Green Knight's symbolism since the discovery of the poem. British medievalist C. S. Lewis said the character was \"as vivid and concrete as any image in literature\" and J. R. R. Tolkien said he was the \"most difficult character\" to interpret in \"Sir Gawain\". His major role in Arthurian literature is that of a judge and tester of knights, thus he is at once terrifying, friendly, and mysterious. He appears in only two other poems: \"The Greene Knight\" and \"King Arthur and King Cornwall\". Scholars have attempted to connect him to other mythical characters, such as Jack in the green of English tradition and to Al-Khidr, but no definitive connection has yet been established.\n\nHowever, there is a possibility, as Alice Buchanan has argued, that the colour green is erroneously attributed to the Green Knight due to the poet's mistranslation or misunderstanding of the Irish word \"glas\", which could either mean grey or green. In the Death of Curoi (one of the Irish stories from Bricriu's Feast), Curoi stands in for Bertilak, and is often called \"the man of the grey mantle\". Though the words usually used for grey in the Death of Curoi are \"lachtna\" or \"odar\", roughly meaning milk-coloured and shadowy respectively, in later works featuring a green knight, the word \"glas\" is used and may have been the basis of misunderstanding.\n\nThe girdle's symbolic meaning, in \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", has been construed in a variety of ways. Interpretations range from sexual in nature to spiritual. Those who argue for the sexual inference view the girdle as a \"trophy\". However, it is not entirely clear who the \"winner\" is: Sir Gawain or Lady Bertilak. The girdle is given to Gawain by Lady Bertilak in order to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Lord Bertilak returns home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host but, instead, hides it. This introduces the spiritual interpretation, that Gawain’s acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in the face of death. To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to follow Christ faithfully, chooses the easier path. In \"Sir Gawain\", the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one’s acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either–or situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain in more ways than one. While Gawain is able to resist Bertilak’s wife’s sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of \"Sir Gawain\", Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away). \nThe poem contains the first recorded use of the word \"pentangle\" in English It contains the only representation of such a symbol on Gawain's shield in the Gawain literature. What is more, the poet uses a total of 46 lines in order to describe the meaning of the pentangle; no other symbol in the poem receives as much attention or is described in such detail. The poem describes the pentangle as a symbol of faithfulness and an \"endless knot\". From lines 640 to 654, the five points of the pentangle relate directly to Gawain in five ways: five senses, his five fingers, his faith found in the five wounds of Christ, the five joys of Mary (whose face was on the inside of the shield) and finally friendship, fraternity, purity, politeness and pity (traits that Gawain possessed around others). In line 625, it is described as \"a sign by Solomon\". Solomon, the third king of Israel, in the 10th century BC, was said to have the mark of the pentagram on his ring, which he received from the archangel Michael. The pentagram seal on this ring was said to give Solomon power over demons.\n\nAlong these lines, some academics link the Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol was called a \"Drudenfuß\" and was placed on household objects to keep out evil. The symbol was also associated with magical charms that, if recited or written on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.\n\nGawain’s pentangle also symbolises the \"phenomenon of physically endless objects signifying a temporally endless quality.\" Many poets use the symbol of the circle to show infinity or endlessness, but Gawain’s poet insisted on using something more complex. In medieval number theory, the number five is considered a \"circular number\", since it \"reproduces itself in its last digit when raised to its powers\". Furthermore, it replicates itself geometrically; that is, every pentangle has a smaller pentagon that allows a pentangle to be embedded in it and this \"process may be repeated forever with decreasing pentangles\". Thus, by reproducing the number five, which in medieval number symbolism signified incorruptibility, Gawain's pentangle represents his eternal incorruptibility.\n\nGawain's refusal of the Lady Bertilak's ring has major implications for the remainder of the story. While the modern student may tend to pay more attention to the girdle as the eminent object offered by the lady, readers in the time of Gawain would have noticed the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties similarly done by the Gawain-poet in \"Pearl\". This is especially true of the lady's ring as scholars believe it to be a ruby or carbuncle, indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a \"brygt sunne\" (line 1819), a \"fiery sun.\" This red colour can be seen as symbolizing royalty, divinity, and the Passion of the Christ, something that Gawain as a knight of the Round Table would strive for, but this colour could also represent the negative qualities of temptation and covetousness. Given the importance of magic rings in Arthurian romance, this remarkable ring would also have been believed to protect the wearer from harm just as Lady Bertilak claims the girdle will.\n\nThe poet highlights number symbolism to add symmetry and meaning to the poem. For example, three kisses are exchanged between Gawain and Bertilak's wife; Gawain is tempted by her on three separate days; Bertilak goes hunting three times, and the Green Knight swings at Gawain three times with his axe. The number two also appears repeatedly, as in the two beheading scenes, two confession scenes, and two castles. The five points of the pentangle, the poet adds, represent Gawain's virtues, for he is \"faithful five ways and five times each\". The poet goes on to list the ways in which Gawain is virtuous: all five of his senses are without fault; his five fingers never fail him, and he always remembers the five wounds of Christ, as well as the five joys of the Virgin Mary. The fifth five is Gawain himself, who embodies the five moral virtues of the code of chivalry: \"friendship, generosity, chastity, courtesy, and piety\". All of these virtues reside, as the poet says, in the \"Endless Knot\" of the pentangle, which forever interlinks and is never broken. This intimate relationship between symbol and faith allows for rigorous allegorical interpretation, especially in the physical role that the shield plays in Gawain's quest. Thus, the poet makes Gawain the epitome of perfection in knighthood through number symbolism.\nThe number five is also found in the structure of the poem itself. \"Sir Gawain\" is 101 stanzas long, traditionally organised into four 'Fits' of 21, 24, 34, and 22 stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to believe that they are the work of the copyist and not of the poet. The surviving manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some scholars argue that these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last parts are 22 stanzas long. The second and second-to-last parts are only one stanza long, and the middle five parts are eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the Ten Commandments). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of transgression and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.\n\nAt the story's climax, Gawain is wounded superficially in the neck by the Green Knight's axe. During the medieval period, the body and the soul were believed to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin. The neck, specifically, was believed to correlate with the part of the soul related to will, connecting the reasoning part (the head) and the courageous part (the heart). Gawain's sin resulted from using his will to separate reasoning from courage. By accepting the girdle from the lady, he employs reason to do something less than courageous—evade death in a dishonest way. Gawain's wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound. The Green Knight's series of tests shows Gawain the weakness that has been in him all along: the desire to use his will pridefully for personal gain, rather than submitting his will in humility to God. The Green Knight, by engaging with the greatest knight of Camelot, also reveals the moral weakness of pride in all of Camelot, and therefore all of humanity. However, the wounds of Christ, believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies, are mentioned throughout the poem in the hope that this sin of prideful \"stiffneckedness\" will be healed among fallen mortals.\n\nMany critics argue that \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" should be viewed, above all, as a romance. Medieval romances typically recount the marvellous adventures of a chivalrous, heroic knight, often of super-human ability, who abides by chivalry's strict codes of honour and demeanour, embarks upon a quest and defeats monsters, thereby winning the favour of a lady. Thus, medieval romances focus not on love and sentiment (as the term \"romance\" implies today), but on adventure.\n\nGawain's function, as medieval scholar Alan Markman says, \"is the function of the romance hero … to stand as the champion of the human race, and by submitting to strange and severe tests, to demonstrate human capabilities for good or bad action.\" Through Gawain's adventure, it becomes clear that he is merely human. The reader becomes attached to this human view in the midst of the poem's romanticism, relating to Gawain's humanity while respecting his knightly qualities. Gawain \"shows us what moral conduct is. We shall probably not equal his behaviour, but we admire him for pointing out the way.\"\n\nIn viewing the poem as a medieval romance, many scholars see it as intertwining chivalric and courtly love laws under the English Order of the Garter. The group's motto, 'honi soit qui mal y pense', or \"Shamed be he who finds evil here,\" is written at the end of the poem. Some critics describe Gawain's peers wearing girdles of their own as evidence of the origin of the Order of the Garter. However, in the parallel poem \"The Greene Knight\", the lace is white, not green, and is considered the origin of the collar worn by the knights of the Bath, not the Order of the Garter. The motto on the poem was probably written by a copyist and not by the original author. Still, the connection made by the copyist to the Order is not extraordinary.\n\nThe poem is in many ways deeply Christian, with frequent references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at it in the context of the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare \"Sir Gawain\" to the other three poems of the \"Gawain\" manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret \"Gawain\" similarly. Comparing it to the poem \"Cleanness\" (also known as \"Purity\"), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in \"Gawain's\" case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In \"Cleanness\" the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.\n\nOne of the key points stressed in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. \"Gawain\" was written around the time of the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.\n\nWhile the character of the Green Knight is usually not viewed as a representation of Christ in \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", critics do acknowledge a parallel. Lawrence Besserman, a specialist in medieval literature, explains that \"the Green Knight is not a figurative representative of Christ. But the idea of Christ's divine/human nature provides a medieval conceptual framework that supports the poet's serious/comic account of the Green Knight's supernatural/human qualities and actions.\" This duality exemplifies the influence and importance of Christian teachings and views of Christ in the era of the Gawain Poet.\n\nFurthermore, critics note the Christian reference to Christ's crown of thorns at the conclusion of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". After Gawain returns to Camelot and tells his story regarding the newly acquired green sash, the poem concludes with a brief prayer and a reference to \"the thorn-crowned God\". Besserman theorises that \"with these final words the poet redirects our attention from the circular girdle-turned-sash (a double image of Gawain's \"yntrawpe/renoun\") to the circular Crown of Thorns (a double image of Christ's humiliation turned triumph).\"\n\nThroughout the poem, Gawain encounters numerous trials testing his devotion and faith in Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the Virgin Mary does he find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle given to him by Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal. Another interpretation sees the work in terms of the perfection of virtue, with the pentangle representing the moral perfection of the connected virtues, the Green Knight as Christ exhibiting perfect fortitude, and Gawain as slightly imperfect in fortitude by virtue of flinching when under the threat of death.\n\nAn analogy is also made between Gawain's trial and the Biblical test that Adam encounters in the Garden of Eden. Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak's wife by accepting the girdle. Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing him to become a better Christian by learning from his mistakes. Through the various games played and hardships endured, Gawain finds his place within the Christian world.\n\nFeminist literary critics see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak's wife, for example, are the most powerful characters in the poem—Morgan especially, as she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain's scar can be seen as symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.\n\nIn contrast, others argue that the poem focuses mostly on the opinions, actions, and abilities of men. For example, on the surface, it appears that Bertilak's wife is a strong leading character. By adopting the masculine role, she appears to be an empowered individual, particularly in the bedroom scene. This is not entirely the case, however. While the Lady is being forward and outgoing, Gawain's feelings and emotions are the focus of the story, and Gawain stands to gain or lose the most. The Lady \"makes the first move\", so to speak, but Gawain ultimately decides what is to become of those actions. He, therefore, is in charge of the situation and even the relationship.\n\nIn the bedroom scene, both the negative and positive actions of the Lady are motivated by her desire. Her feelings cause her to step out of the typical female role and into that of the male, thus becoming more empowered. At the same time, those same actions make the Lady appear adulterous; some scholars compare her with Eve in the Bible. By forcing Gawain to take her girdle, i.e. the apple, the pact made with Bertilak—and therefore the Green Knight—is broken. In this sense, it is clear that at the hands of the Lady, Gawain is a \"good man seduced\".\n\nFrom 1350 to 1400—the period in which the poem is thought to have been written—Wales experienced several raids at the hands of the English, who were attempting to colonise the area. The Gawain poet uses a North West Midlands dialect common on the Welsh–English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem through the lens of postcolonialism, and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role in the poem. Most critics agree that gender plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact in the poem.\n\nA large amount of critical debate also surrounds the poem as it relates to the bi-cultural political landscape of the time. Some argue that Bertilak is an example of the hybrid Anglo-Welsh culture found on the Welsh–English border. They therefore view the poem as a reflection of a hybrid culture that plays strong cultures off one another to create a new set of cultural rules and traditions. Other scholars, however, argue that historically much Welsh blood was shed well into the 14th century, creating a situation far removed from the more friendly hybridisation suggested by Ingham. To support this argument further, it is suggested that the poem creates an \"us versus them\" scenario contrasting the knowledgeable civilised English with the uncivilised borderlands that are home to Bertilak and the other monsters that Gawain encounters.\n\nIn contrast to this perception of the colonial lands, others argue that the land of Hautdesert, Bertilak’s territory, has been misrepresented or ignored in modern criticism. They suggest that it is a land with its own moral agency, one that plays a central role in the story. Bonnie Lander, for example, argues that the denizens of Hautdesert are \"intelligently immoral\", choosing to follow certain codes and rejecting others, a position which creates a \"distinction … of moral insight versus moral faith\". Lander thinks that the border dwellers are more sophisticated because they do not unthinkingly embrace the chivalric codes but challenge them in a philosophical, and—in the case of Bertilak's appearance at Arthur’s court—literal sense. Lander’s argument about the superiority of the denizens of Hautdesert hinges on the lack of self-awareness present in Camelot, which leads to an unthinking populace that frowns on individualism. In this view, it is not Bertilak and his people, but Arthur and his court, who are the monsters.\n\nSeveral scholars have attempted to find a real-world correspondence for Gawain's journey to the Green Chapel. The Anglesey islands, for example, are mentioned in the poem. They exist today as a single island off the coast of Wales. In line 700, Gawain is said to pass the \"Holy Head\", believed by many scholars to be either Holywell or the Cistercian abbey of Poulton in Pulford. Holywell is associated with the beheading of Saint Winifred. As the story goes, Winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances. Her uncle, another saint, put her head back in place and healed the wound, leaving only a white scar. The parallels between this story and Gawain's make this area a likely candidate for the journey.\n\nGawain's trek leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet's dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it lies in the writer's dialect area and matches the topographical features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century. The Green Chapel is thought to be in either Lud's Church or Wetton Mill, as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author. Ralph Elliott located the chapel (\"two myle henne\" v1078) from the old manor house at Swythamley Park at the bottom of a valley (\"bothm of the brem valay\" v2145) on a hillside (\"loke a littel on the launde, on thi lyfte honde\" v2147) in an enormous fissure (\"an olde caue,/or a creuisse of an olde cragge\" v2182-83). Several have tried to replicate this expedition and others such as Michael Twomey have created a virtual tour of Gawain's journey entitled 'Travels with Sir Gawain' that include photographs of landscapes mentioned and particular views mentioned in the text.\n\nAccording to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight represents a threat to homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and poses a threat to their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.\n\nCarolyn Dinshaw argues that the poem may have been a response to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem \"Cleanness\", he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into \"Gawain\" in his descriptions of the Green Knight.\n\nBeyond this, Dinshaw proposes that Gawain can be read as a woman-like figure. He is the passive one in the advances of Lady Bertilak, as well as in his encounters with Lord Bertilak, where he acts the part of a woman in kissing the man. However, while the poem does have homosexual elements, these elements are brought up by the poet in order to establish heterosexuality as the normal lifestyle of Gawain's world. The poem does this by making the kisses between Lady Bertilak and Gawain sexual in nature, but rendering the kisses between Gawain and Lord Bertilak \"unintelligible\" to the medieval reader. In other words, the poet portrays kisses between a man and a woman as having the possibility of leading to sex, while in a heterosexual world kisses between a man and a man are portrayed as having no such possibility.\n\nThough the surviving manuscript dates from the fourteenth century, the first published version of the poem did not appear until as late as 1839, when Sir Frederic Madden of the British Museum recognized the poem as worth reading. Madden's scholarly, Middle English edition of the poem was followed in 1898 by the first Modern English translation – a prose version by literary scholar Jessie L. Weston. In 1925, J.R.R. Tolkien and E.V. Gordon published a scholarly edition of the Middle English text of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\"; a revised edition of this text was prepared by Norman Davis and published in 1967. The book, featuring a text in Middle English with extensive scholarly notes, is frequently confused with the translation into Modern English that Tolkien prepared, along with translations of \"Pearl\" and \"Sir Orfeo\", late in his life. Many editions of the latter work, first published in 1975, shortly after his death, list Tolkien on the cover as author rather than translator.\n\nFor students, especially undergraduate students, the text is usually given in translation. Notable translators include Jessie Weston, whose 1898 prose translation and 1907 poetic translation took many liberties with the original; Theodore Banks, whose 1929 translation was praised for its adaptation of the language to modern usage; and Marie Borroff, whose imitative translation was first published in 1967 and \"entered the academic canon\" in 1968, in the second edition of the \"Norton Anthology of English Literature\". In 2010, her (slightly revised) translation was published as a Norton Critical Edition, with a foreword by Laura Howes. In 2007, Simon Armitage, who grew up near the Gawain poet's purported residence, published a translation which attracted attention in the US and the United Kingdom, and was published in the United States by Norton, which replaced Borroff's translation with Armitage's for the ninth edition of the \"Norton Anthology of English Literature\". Other modern translations include those by Larry Benson, Brian Stone, James Winny, Helen Cooper, W. S. Merwin, Jacob Rosenberg, William Vantuono, Joseph Glaser, Bernard O'Donoghue, John Gardner, and Francis Ingledew. In 2015, Zach Weinersmith published Augie and the Green Knight, a children's adaptation in which the protagonist is a young girl. A new and illustrated translation of the work by illustrator and historian Michael Smith is currently being crowdsourced by publisher Unbound with a planned publication date of 2018.\n\nThe poem has been adapted to film twice, on both occasions by writer-director Stephen Weeks: first as \"Gawain and the Green Knight\" in 1973 and again in 1984 as \"\", featuring Miles O'Keeffe as Gawain and Sean Connery as the Green Knight. Both films have been criticised for deviating from the poem's plot. Also, Bertilak and the Green Knight are never connected. French/Australian director Martin Beilby directed a short (30') film adaptation in 2014. There have been at least two television adaptations, \"Gawain and the Green Knight\" in 1991 and the animated \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" in 2002. The BBC broadcast a documentary presented by Simon Armitage in which the journey depicted in the poem is traced, using what are believed to be the actual locations. On 5 November 2018, it was announced that a new film adaptation titled \"Green Knight\" is in the works, to be directed by American filmmaker David Lowery for A24.\n\nThe poem was also adapted for the \"Adventure Time\" episode \"Seventeen\" where the Green Knight arrives on Finn's 17th birthday, issuing him the challenge, as well as a series of follow-up games.\n\nThe Tyneside Theatre company presented a stage version of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" at the University Theatre, Newcastle at Christmas 1971. It was directed by Michael Bogdanov and adapted for the stage from the translation by Brian Stone. The music and lyrics were composed by Iwan Williams using medieval carols, such as the \"Boar's Head Carol\", as inspiration and folk instruments such as the Northumbrian pipes, whistles and bhodran to create a \"rough\" feel. Stone had referred Bogdanov to \"Cuchulain and the Beheading Game\", a sequence which is contained in The Grenoside Sword dance. Bogdanov found the pentangle theme to be contained in most sword dances, and so incorporated a long sword dance while Gawain lay tossing uneasily before getting up to go to the Green Chapel. The dancers made the knot of the pentangle around his drowsing head with their swords. The interlacing of the hunting and wooing scenes was achieved by frequent cutting of the action from hunt to bed-chamber and back again, while the locale of both remained on-stage.\n\nIn 1992 Simon Corble created an adaptation with medieval songs and music for The Midsommer Actors' Company. performed as walkabout productions in the summer 1992 at Thurstaston Common and Beeston Castle and in August 1995 at Brimham Rocks, North Yorkshire. Corble later wrote a substantially revised version which was produced indoors at the O'Reilly Theatre, Oxford in February 2014.\n\n\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" was first adapted as an opera in 1978 by the composer Richard Blackford on commission from the village of Blewbury, Oxfordshire. The libretto was written for the adaptation by the children's novelist John Emlyn Edwards. The \"Opera in Six Scenes\" was subsequently recorded by Decca between March and June 1979 and released on the Argo label in November 1979.\n\n\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" was adapted into an opera called \"Gawain\" by Harrison Birtwistle, first performed in 1991. Birtwistle's opera was praised for maintaining the complexity of the poem while translating it into lyric, musical form. Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman's \"Gwyneth and the Green Knight\", first performed in 2002. This opera uses \"Sir Gawain\" as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain's female squire, Gwyneth, who is trying to become a knight. Plowman's version was praised for its approachability, as its target is the family audience and young children, but criticised for its use of modern language and occasional preachy nature.\n\n\n"}

The play is the second in \"The Talley Trilogy\", between his plays \"Talley & Son\" and \"Fifth of July\". Set in an boathouse near rural Lebanon, Missouri in 1944, it is a romantic comedy following the characters Matt Friedman and Sally Talley as they settle their feelings for each other. Wilson received the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work. The play is unlike Wilson's other works, taking place in one act with no intermission, set in ninety-seven minutes of real time, with no set change.\n\n\"Talley's Folly\" depicts one night in the lives of two unlikely sweethearts, Matt Friedman and Sally Talley. The one-act play takes place in a boathouse on the Talley farm in Missouri on the Fourth of July, 1944.\n\nThe play opens with Matt directly addressing the audience, telling them that the play will take ninety-seven minutes and he hopes to relay his story properly in that time. Taking the time to point out some staging elements, he tells the audience that the gazebo-like structure next to him is a Victorian boathouse, which has fallen into disrepair. While on vacation in Lebanon, Missouri the previous summer, Matt met Sally and has sent her a letter every day since. Though the single reply from Sally gave him no hope for romantic encouragement, he has returned to ask her to marry him.\n\nSally arrives at the boathouse and is in disbelief that Matt has shown up uninvited, even though he had written her that he planned to come for the holiday. Matt's arrival has created a stir in Sally's conservative Protestant household, where a Jewish man is not welcomed, especially when his intentions are to court their daughter, who is eleven years younger than he.\n\nMatt's interest in Sally had never waned. He once drove from his home in St. Louis to the hospital where she worked and waited hours for her, even after being informed that she was not available.\n\nThe conversation turns to the boathouse structure. Sally tells him it was constructed by her uncle, who built follies all over town. Her uncle did only what he wanted to do, and Sally considers him the healthiest member of the family for his courage.\n\nEventually, the couple begins to reminisce about the night they met and the time they spent together the previous summer. Matt takes it as a positive sign that she has changed into a nice dress before coming to see him tonight. Sally's protests do not match her behavior and he pushes forward. She is the most intriguing woman he has ever met, and he is determined to make her his wife.\n\nAdmitting that he has called Sally's aunt every two weeks during the past year, Matt reveals that he knows Sally was fired from a Sunday school teaching job. Apparently, she had been encouraging the students to read Thortstein Veblen's \"The Theory of the Leisure Class\" in addition to the Methodist reader. The rise of labor unions was affecting the families of the children in her class and she felt obligated to help educate them. Her unorthodox methods earned her the consternation of the church elders as well as her own family, who own the garment factory on which the labor issue centered.\n\nSally then tries to glean some information about Matt's background, a subject about which he is very guarded. He finally admits to Sally that he was probably born in Kaunas, Lithuania. His father had been an engineer. In 1911, his father was overheard in a French cafe discussing his work with nitrogen, a reference to the Haber process developed in 1909 by a Jewish-German chemist, Fritz Haber, to extract nitrogen from the air, which made the manufacture of gunpowder and fertilizer inexpensive. The family was later detained as they were attempting to cross the border.\n\nMatt's father and older sister were tortured until the French realized that the father had no information of any value to them. In the meantime, the sister had fallen into a coma from which she never awoke. They later went to the German authorities and were again detained. Matt escaped to America through the help of some relatives. Haunted by his childhood grief, Matt vowed never to bring another child into the world. He was content with his life until he met Sally. He now feels forever changed and hopeful for the first time in his life.\n\nHaving risked the vulnerability of revealing his background, Matt presses Sally to share why she, a beautiful 31-year-old woman, has never married. She diverts the conversation to economics, which frustrates Matt. Sally finally reveals her disappointment in love many years ago, which makes her reluctant to fall in love again. Her family had partnered her with Harley Campbell, whose family was also wealthy. The match was supposedly made in heaven, especially for the business interests of the two families. Sally had been a cheerleader and Harley had been a basketball star.\n\nUnfortunately, the families' fortunes waned during the Depression. In addition, Sally was struck with tuberculosis and sequestered for a long time. A pelvic infection left her barren, and Harley's family no longer condoned their marriage.\n\nMatt comments on the irony of their situation, that he'd been lamenting over the fact that he was in love with a woman but could never have children and now this woman presents him with the same situation. He believes that an angel has guided his path to her. Sally agrees to marry him and move to St. Louis, and they vow to return to the boathouse every year so they don't forget where they fell in love.\n\n\"Talley's Folly\" was first performed Off-Broadway by the Circle Repertory Company on May 1, 1979, closing on June 3, 1979. Directed by Marshall W. Mason, the cast starred Judd Hirsch as Matt Friedman and Trish Hawkins as Sally Talley. The set was designed by John Lee Beatty, with costumes by Jennifer von Mayrhauser, lighting by Dennis Parichy, and sound design by Chuck London. The production then transferred to the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nThe play debuted on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on February 7, 1980 for previews, and closed on November 18, 1980 after 286 performances. Hirsch and Hawkins starred in the Broadway production. \n\nAn off-Broadway revival was mounted at the Laura Pels Theater in March 2013, directed by Michael Wilson and featuring Danny Burstein and Sarah Paulson.\n\n\"Talley's Folly\" was produced in London at the Lyric Theatre, opening on May 27, 1982 and running until the July 3, 1982. Sally was played by Hayley Mills and Matt was played by Jonathan Price.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It balances the agony of her seclusion with the brief bright moments when she was able to experience some joy.\n\nAfter one preview, the original Broadway production, directed by Charles Nelson Reilly and starring Julie Harris, opened on April 28, 1976 at the Longacre Theatre, where it ran for 116 performances. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reviewer wrote \"With her technical ability and her emotional range, Miss Harris can convey profound inner turmoil at the same time that she displays irrepressible gaiety of spirit.\"\n\nHarris, who portrayed 15 different characters in the play, won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, earned a Drama Desk Award nomination for Unique Theatrical Experience, and won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Recording. She appeared in a televised PBS production and extensively toured the country with the play for a number of years.\n\nDickinson biographer Lyndall Gordon criticized the play for perpetuating Mabel Loomis Todd's chaste, hermit-like image of Dickinson, as opposed to the lively, witty, provocative, and sometimes erotic Dickinson present in her work and known to those who knew her more personally.\n\nThe Spanish translation of the play was done by Argentinean poet Silvina Ocampo for the Buenos Aires premiere starring China Zorrilla on January 1981. The production ran for more than 500 performances and Zorrilla embarked on a Latin American tour that ended at New York's Hunter College in 1983 and Washington's Kennedy Center.

{"id": "24878302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24878302", "title": "The New Adventures of Pinocchio (film)", "text": "The New Adventures of Pinocchio (film)\n\nThe New Adventures of Pinocchio is a 1999 direct to video film that is a sequel to the 1996 film, \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\". The film was directed by Michael Anderson and featured Martin Landau reprising his role as Geppetto with Udo Kier reprising his role as Lorenzini, but also playing Lorenzini's widow Madame Flambeau. The film also featured Sarah Alexander, Simon Schatzberger, Warwick Davis and Ben Ridgeway, and introduced Gabriel Thomson as Pinocchio. This is the last film Michael Anderson directed, before his death in 2018.\n\nIn July 1890, Pinocchio and his friend Lampwick skip school to go to a carnival. While there, they watch a presentation by the carnival's leader, Madame Flambeau. She gives a man with one shorter leg some of her Elixir, and his leg grows to the length of the other one. The carnival's dwarf then leads Pinocchio and Lampwick to \"The Hall of Freaks\", a place with a clown that washes his face, an albino who can blow fire from his mouth, a large fish tank that have fish with human faces, a woman with a beard, and a fairy called \"Blue\" who only Pinocchio can see. They then return to Pinocchio's house and find his father Geppetto, who is very sick. Pinocchio and Lampwick then return to the carnival to each buy some of Madame Flambeau's Elixir. Felinet and Volpe, a human-cat and human-fox respectively, lead them to Madame Flambeau. They don't have enough money for the Elixir, so they agree to work for her in the carnival. Lampwick drinks his Elixir and returns home, and Pinocchio gives his Elixir to Geppetto.\n\nThe next morning, Pinocchio finds the Elixir has transformed his father into a puppet. Madame Flambeau enters their house, and gets angry at Pinocchio for giving the Elixir to his father instead of himself. She reveals she is Lorenzini's widow. Geppetto and Pinocchio are then forced to work at the carnival's show. Geppetto eventually accepts and enjoys being a puppet, much to Pinocchio's dismay. Lampwick had been transformed into a sea donkey because of the Elixir, and Pinocchio finds him in the large fish tank. Madame Flambeau compromises Pinocchio that if he becomes a puppet, then Geppetto and Lampwick will automatically become human again; but this was a trick so that Pinocchio would perform in front of the prince. Seconds before the show, the dwarf takes Pinocchio; Felinet and Volpe take Geppetto and replace the two with inanimate puppets. The prince angrily leaves due to the audience booing. Madame Flambeau and her team go on a search for Geppetto and Pinocchio. The dwarf takes Pinocchio and Lampwick to the forest where Pinocchio came from. The dwarf transforms and reveals himself as Pepe.\n\nMadame Flambeau finds Geppetto and then finds Pinocchio. Geppetto apologizes to Pinocchio for being more interested in his fame than his son, and it is implied he wants to be human again. Madame Flambeau then transforms into Lorenzini, a secret he had been hiding the whole time. He plans on cooking Lampwick using Pinocchio and Geppetto as the firewood. Pepe gives Pinocchio clues on how to find the Heart of the Mountain. Pinocchio, Geppetto and Lampwick get to the Heart of the Mountain via sliding down a long pathway. Once there, they find a pool called the \"magic water\", something that turns someone/something into their true nature. Lorenzini and the others also enter the Heart of the Mountain. Lampwick falls into the water and is instantly restored to human. Lorenzini laughs and jumps in the magic water thinking it will make him powerful, but it instead turns him into \"the sea monster\" over a period of time. Geppetto and Pinocchio then jump in and are instantly restored to human. Volpe and Felinet jump in but their true nature remains.\n\nThe next day, Lorenzini is locked up in a cage, and is laughed at by the carnival's audience for his grotesque sea monster appearance. Pinocchio and Lampwick go to see Geppetto's puppet show, along with a girl called \"Isabella\" who looks just like Blue but with black hair. Isabella tells Pinocchio that the Elixir can't truly fix anyone's troubles. Geppetto performs in front of the prince, and is applauded by Pinocchio and the rest of the audience. As the second lot of credits roll by, Lorenzini escapes his prison.\n\n\nLike \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\", this film utilized animatronic puppets that were created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop.\n\nIt was released in Australia on April 6, 2000.\n\nThe New Adventures of Pinocchio currently holds a 36% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n"}
{"id": "48705675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48705675", "title": "The Predator (film)", "text": "The Predator (film)\n\nThe Predator is a 2018 American science fiction action film directed by Shane Black and written by Black and Fred Dekker. It is the fourth installment in the \"Predator\" film series, following \"Predator\" (1987), \"Predator 2\" (1990), and \"Predators\" (2010). Black had a supporting role in the original film, while John Davis returns as producer from the first three installments. The film stars Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, Jacob Tremblay, Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Munn, Thomas Jane, Alfie Allen, and Sterling K. Brown and follows a group of PTSD-afflicted soldiers who must fight off an invading pair of Predators. \n\nTalks of a new \"Predator\" installment began in June 2014, with Black being confirmed as writer and director; much of the cast signed on between October 2016 and January 2017. Filming took place in British Columbia from February to June 2017, with the entire climax being reshot in July 2018 following poor test screenings.\n\n\"The Predator\" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 14, 2018 by 20th Century Fox, in IMAX and Dolby Cinema, as well as standard formats. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $160 million worldwide.\n\nA Predator ship crash-lands on Earth. Army Ranger sniper Quinn McKenna and his team are attacked by the Predator on a hostage retrieval mission. McKenna incapacitates the Predator and has its armor mailed off. At the behest of government agent Will Traeger, he is captured and held for examination. Traeger also takes the Predator to a lab for experimentation and observation, recruiting evolutionary biologist Casey Bracket to study it. The Predator awakes, breaks out of its bonds, kills lab workers, but spares Bracket before leaving. \n\nMcKenna is bussed off with a group of other government captives, including ex-Marine Gaylord \"Nebraska\" Williams, military veterans Coyle and Baxley, helicopter pilot Nettles, and Lynch, another ex-Marine. Seeing the Predator escape from the lab firsthand, they take over the bus. Taking Bracket with them, they head over to McKenna's estranged wife, Emily, where he expects to find the Predator armor he mailed off. However, McKenna's autistic son Rory has gone trick-or-treating while wearing this armor in hopes of avoiding detection from bullies.\n\nMcKenna and the others find his son just in time to stop a pair of Predator Dogs from ambushing the boy. The Predator chases them into a nearby school. They start to give the Predator's armor back when another, larger Predator arrives and kills the first. They flee, and the second Predator sets out to retrieve the lost technology.\n\nBracket concludes that the Predators are attempting to improve themselves with the DNA of humans and, presumably, other planets' inhabitants. The team flees to an abandoned barn, but Traeger finds them, captures them, and shares his theory that the Predators anticipate that climate change will end their ability to retrieve human DNA for further hybridization, so they are scrambling to retrieve it before it is too late. Seeing Rory drawing a map to the spaceship, Traeger takes the boy away to go to the ship. The team escapes and goes after him with the help of a brain-damaged Predator Dog. \n\nWhen all are at the crashed Predator ship, the second Predator arrives, kills Lynch, and explains through translation software that it will blow up the ship to keep it out of their hands and then give them all a head start before it hunts them down. The Predator quickly kills off most of the team. Traeger tries to use a Predator weapon on the alien but accidentally kills himself in the process. \n\nThe Predator takes Rory, presumably because his autism reflects an advancement in human evolution and is therefore worthwhile in the Predator hybridization, and flies away in his ship. McKenna, Nebraska, and Nettles land on the ship's exterior, but the Predator activates a force field. This slices Nettles' legs off, and he falls off of the ship to his death. Nebraska sacrifices himself and slides into the ship's turbine, causing it to crash. McKenna sneaks into the ship as it crashes and attacks the Predator. After the crash, Bracket arrives, and the three manage to overpower and finish the Predator with its own weapons. They pay their respects to their fallen comrades with trinkets representing each one before heading off.\n\nAfter these events, McKenna and Rory are seen in a science lab watching the opening of cargo found on the Predator's ship. A piece of technology floats out and attaches itself to a lab worker, working as a transformative \"Predator killer\" suit before deactivating.\n\n\nIn June 2014, Fox announced a sequel. Shane Black, who also starred as supporting character Rick Hawkins in \"Predator\", directed, and co-wrote with Fred Dekker, while John Davis produced. Davis has said of the film that he thinks it is fresh and reimagines the franchise in a \"different, interesting way\". In February 2016, Black stated that the title of the new sequel would be \"The Predator\". He has referred to the project as an event film which aims to elevate the \"Predator\" series: \"It's an attempt to 'event-ise' the Predator again... [An attempt to] make it more mysterious.\" Black also expressed that the film would mark a return to the \"intimate\" scale of the original film and that the filmmakers hoped to achieve “the same sense of wonderment and newness that \"Close Encounters\" had when that came out.”\n\nThe film is set in the present day and the titular character has upgraded armor. The film follows the events of \"Predator\" and \"Predator 2\", but is set prior to the events of the 2010 film \"Predators\". Black has said that he looked for plot details set up in the previous \"Predator\" movies that he could retrospectively link back to with the new film. To that end, Jake Busey was cast as Sean Keyes, the son of Peter Keyes (a character who was portrayed by Busey's father Gary Busey in \"Predator 2\"). In February 2016, the studio revealed a teaser image of the film, confirming the title \"The Predator\".\n\nMartin Whist served as the film's production designer, while effects house Amalgamated Dynamics provided the creature effects for \"The Predator\", having done so previously for the \"Alien vs. Predator\" films.\n\nChief-executive-officer of 20th Century Fox Stacey Snider shared her thoughts on \"The Predator\" and Shane Black and Fred Dekker’s script:\nArnold Schwarzenegger talked with Black about returning as his character from the first \"Predator\" film, but declined the cameo due to the short role. Rapper 50 Cent also spoke of the possibility of being involved in the film but ended up dropping out. By September 2016, Benicio del Toro had signed on to star. The following month, Boyd Holbrook replaced del Toro, who departed due to scheduling issues. In November 2016, Olivia Munn joined the cast. In January 2017, Trevante Rhodes, Keegan-Michael Key, Sterling K. Brown, Thomas Jane and Jacob Tremblay joined the cast. In February, Alfie Allen and Yvonne Strahovski were added. In March, the last main role was filled by Augusto Aguilera while Jake Busey was also cast in a supporting role.\n\nIn March 2017, Edward James Olmos was cast as Sanchez, a military general. In August 2018, Olmos announced that his role had been cut from the final film, to reduce the film's running time, as his character was not integral to the plot.\n\nFilming was scheduled to begin in February 2017 in Vancouver, British Columbia. On November 21, 2016, Larry Fong was confirmed hired as cinematographer for the film. Black announced that filming had began on February 20, 2017. Filming wrapped on June 2, 2017. Additional photography in Vancouver took place in March 2018. On July 6, 2018, it was revealed the film's third act was entirely re-shot due to test screenings.\n\nHenry Jackman provided the music score for the film.\n\n\"The Predator\" was originally scheduled by 20th Century Fox for a March 2, 2018 release date, until the date was moved to February 9, 2018. It was then delayed to August 3, 2018. In February 2018, the released date was delayed to September 14, 2018. The film's release included IMAX theaters. On May 10, 2018, the first trailer was released. A television spot was released on June 9, while a second full trailer was released on June 26, 2018. The third and final theatrical trailer was released on August 31, 2018. The film's world premiere was at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 2018 at the Ryerson Theatre.\n\n\"The Predator\" has grossed $51 million in the United States and Canada, and $109.5 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $160.5 million, against a production budget of $88 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"The Predator\" was released alongside \"White Boy Rick\", \"A Simple Favor\" and \"\", and was projected to gross $25–32 million from 4,037 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $10.5 million on its first day, including $2.5 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $24 million, finishing first at the box office but marking a lower start than the 2010 film ($24.8 million). It dropped 65% in its second weekend to $8.7 million, finishing fourth. In its third weekend the film grossed $3.9 million, finishing eighth.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 33% based on 253 reviews, and an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"The Predator\" has violence and quips to spare, but its chaotically hollow action adds up to another missed opportunity for a franchise increasingly defined by disappointment.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale, those on PostTrak gave it a 66% positive score and a 55% \"definite recommend\", and social media monitor RelishMix noted there were \"mixed reactions\" about the film online.\n\nWriting for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Jordan Mintzer called the film \"bigger, meaner, gorier, funnier\" than previous installments, writing, \"Whether the world actually needs [a sequel], and whether this reboot was necessary at all, is probably a question worth raising, but at least Black's take on it is to never take it too seriously while keeping us duly entertained.\" Brian Tallerico of \"RogerEbert.com\" praised the ensemble, pacing and Black's direction, writing, \"Black is assisted greatly by an incredibly charismatic cast, and he knows how to use them to amplify their strengths.\" A. A. Dowd of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote \"\"The Predator\", which Black penned with \"Monster Squad\" co-writer and director Fred Dekker, makes a few concessions to modern blockbuster filmmaking, including an overabundance of CGI, a blatantly franchise-thirsty ending, and some winking references to the original. But the movie's values are more 1988 than 2018, and that's what it makes it fun, at least in spurts: Black has captured the spirit of that bygone era of adrenaline-junkie junk without getting all retro-fussy about it.\" He graded the film a B-.\n\nIn a negative review, Dennis Harvey of \"Variety\" called it \"an exhaustingly energetic mess in which a coherent plot and credible characters aren't even on the cluttered menu.\" Writing for \"Nerdist\", Katie Walsh called the film \"messy, chaotic, and convoluted\", adding that its \"comedy and action are at war with each other. Characters spew rat-a-tat quips, while tussling with Predators and their pets, essentially neutralizing the effect of both the humor and the action.\" Jonathan Barkan, writing for \"Dread Central\", gave the film two out of five stars, saying, \"Poor story choices and strange, if not outright silly, character decisions result in an experience that will ultimately leave audiences feeling a great amount of 'meh'.\" Jim Vejvoda of \"IGN\" gave the film a 6.5 out of 10, saying, \"\"The Predator\" does a lot right to reinvigorate the 31-year-old series. But everything crashes down during its frenzied, messy final act, a disappointing conclusion to what had largely been a fun romp up until that point.\"\n\nDirector Shane Black hired his longtime friend, Steven Wilder Striegel (known professionally as \"Steve Wilder\"), for a minor, un-auditioned role in \"The Predator\" (he had also appeared in Black's previous films \"Iron Man 3\" and \"The Nice Guys\"). Wilder has been a registered felony sex offender since 2010, when he pleaded guilty to \"enticing a minor by computer\" after he attempted to lure a 14-year-old girl into a sexual relationship via email. A few days before picture lock on the film, Olivia Munn became aware of Wilder's history and approached Fox executives, insisting that the scene be removed.\n\nBlack defended his casting decision and his friend, until later issuing a public apology and rescinding those comments amid backlash. Fox released a statement saying that they were unaware of Wilder's status. Co-star Sterling K. Brown tweeted in support of Munn, but initially, most other actors on the film remained silent, releasing statements after mounting public pressure.\n\n\"The Predator\" suggests not only that autistic persons who exhibit savant qualities and other forms of neurodiversity are or were advantageous, but that they represents a forward step on the human evolutionary path. According to the scientific opinions reported by \"Syfy Wire\", such a thesis would have some issues. Also the \"New York Post\" review ends by stating: \"But worse is a plot line involving autism and a dubious scientific theory that will leave parents fuming.\"\n\n\"The Predator\" will be released on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD formats on December 18, 2018.\n\nThe film's third act was originally set during the day; after the resulting sequences were deemed ineffective, they were largely reshot at night. Black wanted the home media release to include both versions of the film, \"Predator AM\" and \"Predator PM\", but the studio declined, not wanting to pay to complete the daylight version's digital effects.\n\nThe producer, John Davis, has said that \"The Predator\" sets up two sequels that he hopes Shane Black will return to direct. About this, Black said: \"I would love to say we've been planning a trilogy, but I take one day at a time, in motion-picture terms that's one movie at a time.\"\n\n"}

Twirling practice manipulates the object in circular or near circular patterns. It can also be done indirectly by the use of another object or objects as in the case of devil stick manipulation where handsticks are used. Twirling is performed as a hobby, sport, exercise or performance.\n\nTwirling includes a wide variety of practices that use different equipment or props. All props are 'stick' or simulated stick shape and are rotated during the activity. The types of twirling are arranged alphabetically.\n\nBy using a heavy spinning wheel with handles, astrowheeling combines the aesthetics of twirling and the resistance of spinning wheels into a form of practical exercise. It was inspired by ancient practices that manipulate the rotational inertia of spinning objects in order to develop balance, focus, and control. The current trend of astrowheeling, which uses \"bike-like\" wheels, was popularized in the 1980s in North America.\n\nBaton twirling has expanded beyond parades and is now more comparable to rhythmic gymnastics (see below). The sport is popular in many countries including the United States, Japan, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Canada. Many countries compete each year at the World Baton Twirling Championships.\n\nThe sport of baton twirling is a relatively new discipline that has evolved through many dimensions.\n\nThe distinguishing fundamental characteristics are:\n\nHandling of the baton instrument to create visual images, pictures and patterns, executed with dexterity, smoothness, fluidity, and speed, both close in and around the body and by releasing the baton into the air.\n\nExpression of the body through dance and movement to create a demonstration of strength, flexibility, physical fitness, beauty, aesthetics, and harmony in coordination with the manipulation of the baton.\nThe incorporation of gymnastic movements adapted to baton twirling to create additional elements of risk and excitement.\n\nThe discipline requires the simultaneous blending of these fundamental characteristics all set to music, utilizing time and space to display both technical merit and artistic expression in creating a total package for the viewer’s eye. Baton twirling is an entertaining and exciting sport to watch. The intricate timing and precision required to perform these feats is difficult. Baton twirling requires complete concentration and coordination. It demands top physical conditioning.\n\nBaton twirling encompasses the physical stamina and agility of gymnastics and dance, the beauty of figure skating and ballet, and the technical skill of all these sports combined.\n\nThe distinguishing fundamental characteristics are:\n\nHandling of the baton instrument to create visual images, pictures and patterns, executed with dexterity, smoothness, fluidity, and speed, both close in and around the body and by releasing the baton into the air.\n\nRoutines for competitive sport baton twirling are designed for athletes of novice through elite stages of development, experience and ability. Individual competitive events utilize one-baton, two-baton, or three-baton to standardized music while Group competitive events are performed with members twirling together with precision and unison. Also there are pair and group events which include Freestyle Pairs and Freestyle Team at the highest level. Groups utilize their own pre-recorded music.\n\nProfessionally trained and certified WBTF Judges adjudicate the competitions.\n\nOne of the highest honors in twirling is winning \"WBTF Gold Medalist.\"\n\nOrigins:\n\nBaton twirling started in Eastern Europe and Asia. It is thought it started at dance festivals where the goers used knives, guns, torches and sticks to twirl with and toss. The \"activity\" progressed into the armies of some countries which twirled with rifles during marches. When the army was parading, they added a rifle twirler to the front of the marchers. The rifle was then switched for a \"mace\". The mace was much larger than the batons of today and imbalanced. They are still used by some marching bands at parades nowadays. The mace barer or \"drum major\" twirled the baton whilst leading the army or band. This was very popular in the United States following World War II with the American Legion Bands and the Fireman’s Bands. The maces were altered for easier twirling and now resemble the batons. They were given smaller ends of light rubber, made from hollow light metal and balanced to give accuracy to the twirler. It is thought it was the involvement of females (\"drum majorettes\") and the progression of twirling that resulted in the lightening and balancing of the baton. The sport came to North America when Major Millsap’s created baton twirling when he established Millsap's College in the United States in Mississippi after the Civil War.\n\nWhile many member countries have their own national organizations, the World Baton Twirling Federation governs the sport of baton twirling on an international level.\n\nPen spinning — using one's fingers to manipulate an ordinary inexpensive writing-pen — can be performed anywhere. Sometimes classified as a form of contact juggling, pen spinning may also include tossing and catching of the pen.\n\nCalled \"rōnin mawashi\" in Japan, where it is popular among the per-collegiate community, pen twirling has its stars, as does any other performance or skill. Accomplished masters of the art form that are well known — at least among those who follow the sport — have developed a reputation for creation of certain signature 'moves'. David Weis is credited with creating numerous 'back' style moves, such as the \"BackAround\". Hideaki Kondoh is generally credited with giving the pen trick \"Sonic\" its name, because of the way the pen would blur in his fingers.\n\nPenspinning only recently saw a rapid increase in recognition due to the emergence of internet media websites such as YouTube. From 2006 onwards, the art of Penspinning has developed subcultures in many countries of the world including the Asiatic-regions and Europe (France, Germany and Poland).\n\nPoi is a form of juggling, dance or performance art, accomplished using balls, or various other weights, on ropes or chains — held in each hand, and swung in various circular patterns, similar to club-twirling. It was originally practiced by the Māori people of New Zealand (the word \"poi\" means \"ball\" in Māori).\n\nCombining elements of ballet, gymnastics, theatrical dance, and apparatus manipulation, Rhythmic Gymnastics, once largely considered a sport for women and girls, is growing in popularity among men as well. The Japanese's version of Men's rhythmic gymnastics includes tumbling and is performed on a spring floor. Men compete in four types of apparatus: rope, stick, double rings and clubs. Groups do not use any apparatus. Japan hosted the first men's world championships in 2003.\n\nRhythmic gymnastics as a sport began in the 1940s in the former Soviet Union. It was there that for the first time, the spirit of sports was combined with the sensuous art of classical ballet. (To Isadora Duncan, we credit the famous rebellion against the dogma of classical ballet and the shift toward the creation of a new discipline that would blend art and sport.)\nRecognized in 1961 as 'modern gymnastics', later 'rhythmic sportive gymnastics', rhythmic gymnastics experienced its first World Championships for individual gymnasts in 1963 in Budapest.\n\nToday, Rhythmic gymnastics as a sport continues on, and hobbyists have adopted rhythmic gymnastics props such as the women's Ball, Clubs, Hoop, Ribbon, and Rope, plus the stick and rings of men's gymnastics, as exercise and recreational gear. These props have found their way into the modern 'juggling and community' where they are used to perform tricks and maneuvers for fun fitness, and flexibility.\n\n\"Twirling\", \"sticking,\" and \"stick juggling\" are all common terms for using the twirling prop known as devil sticks, flower sticks, or various other names. A set of devil sticks is made up of one baton and two control sticks.\n\nIn use the central stick, the baton, is pushed, lifted and caressed by the two control sticks causing the stick to flip, wobble, spin, and fly through various maneuvers or tricks.\n\nJuggling sticks similar to the modern variants have continuously evolved as they were passed down through the centuries. Apparently originating in Africa earlier than 3000 BCE, <nowiki>\"devil sticks\"</nowiki> may have followed the Silk Road, from Cairo to China, and have been used in Europe since the Renaissance.\n\nIn some forms of Morris dancing, a stick is twirled in one hand during a dance. For example, in stick dances from Brackley in the Cotswold tradition, each dancer twirls one or two sticks throughout the dance.\n\nStaff twirling is the art or sport of skillfully manipulating a staff, such as a quarterstaff, bo, or other long length of wood, metal, or plastic as recreation, sport, or as a performance.\n\nIn the martial art of \"bojutsu\", a bo is used as a weapon, increasing the force delivered in a strike, through leverage. Bojitsu \"kata\"—detailed patterns of movements practiced to perfect one's form—are also used in many traditional Japanese arts, such as kabuki. Some of these kata, are very flowing and pleasant to experience, both as the one executing the movement, and as a spectator.\n\nStaff twirling has enjoyed recent growth in the , juggling and fire dancing communities, in part due to the influence of martial arts, and in part due to increasing popularity of adult play as recreation.\n\nThe figure-eight twirl can be used as a demonstration that a double rotation is a loop in rotation space that can be shrunk to a point. \n"}

He was also an editor of the poetry of Ossian, Walter Scott, Matthew Arnold, Algernon Charles Swinburne and Eugene Lee-Hamilton.\n\nSharp was born in Paisley and educated at Glasgow Academy and the University of Glasgow, which he attended 1871–1872 without completing a degree. In 1872 he contracted typhoid. During 1874–5 he worked in a Glasgow law office. His health broke down in 1876 and he was sent on a voyage to Australia. In 1878 he took a position in a bank in London.\n\nHe was introduced to Dante Gabriel Rossetti by Sir Noel Paton, and joined the Rossetti literary group; which included Hall Caine, Philip Bourke Marston and Swinburne. He married his cousin Elizabeth in 1884, and devoted himself to writing full-time from 1891, travelling widely.\n\nAlso about this time, he developed an intensely romantic but perhaps asexual attachment to Edith Wingate Rinder, another writer of the consciously Celtic Edinburgh circle surrounding Patrick Geddes and \"The Evergreen\". It was to Rinder (\"EWR\") he attributed the inspiration for his writings as Fiona Macleod thereafter, and to whom he dedicated his first Macleod novel (\"Pharais\") in 1894. Sharp had a complex and ambivalent relationship with W. B. Yeats during the 1890s, as a central tension in the Celtic Revival. Yeats initially found Macleod acceptable and Sharp not, and later fathomed their identity. Sharp found the dual personality an increasing strain.\n\nOn occasions when it was necessary for \"Fiona Macleod\" to write to someone unaware of the dual identity, Sharp would dictate the text to his sister (Mary Beatrice Sharp), whose handwriting would then be passed off as Fiona's manuscript. During his Macleod period, Sharp was a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.\n\nHe died (and is buried) at Ducea di Nelson, Bronte, Sicily: the Dukedom donated to Horatio Nelson from Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. In 1910, Elizabeth Sharp published a biographical memoir attempting to explain the creative necessity behind the deception, and edited a complete edition of his works.\n\n\nIn Disney's 2017 movie production of Beauty and the Beast, the character of Belle, played by Emma Watson, recites to the Beast character several lines of Sharp's poem, \"A Crystal Forest\", \"Each branch, each twig, each blade of grass, / Seems clad miraculously with glass\".\n\n\n"}

The program appears unfinished, and its author is unknown. As the program becomes popular, Tuvok admits he wrote the program himself, to train his security officers in the event of a possible Maquis rebellion; however, as the Maquis proved to integrate well with their crewmates, Tuvok abandoned the program, believing that it would only exacerbate tensions on board the ship. However, given how popular that Insurrection Alpha has already become amongst the crew, Tom Paris offers to help complete the remainder of the program with Tuvok's help, turning the program into a full-fledged holonovel.\n\nWhen Paris and Tuvok start to work on the program in the holodeck, they suddenly find themselves trapped in the virtual brig. They are addressed by the simulation's version of former crew member Seska, who admits that before she had escaped the ship, she had discovered Tuvok's program, and created this trap should he attempt to alter it. Seska's alterations not only affect the holodeck but other parts of \"Voyager\", threatening the well-being of the whole crew. While Tuvok and Paris attempt to survive the simulation, Captain Janeway and B'Elanna Torres attempt to effect changes in the simulation to help them. Ultimately, finding themselves cornered by the virtual Seska and her Maquis crew, Tuvok causes one of the simulation's phaser rifles to overload; the impact ends the simulation, and allows Tuvok and Paris to safely exit the holodeck.\n\n"}
{"id": "23185680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23185680", "title": "Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.", "text": "Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.\n\nZacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U.S. 562 (1977), was an important U.S. Supreme Court case concerning rights of publicity. The Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not immunize the news media from civil liability when they broadcast a performer's entire act without his consent, and the Constitution does not prevent a state from requiring broadcasters to compensate performers. It was the first time (and so far the only time) the Supreme Court heard a case on rights of publicity.\n\nPetitioner Hugo Zacchini had a human cannonball act which he performed at various venues. During August 1972, he was performing his act at the Geauga County Fair in Burton, Ohio. On August 30, Zacchini noticed a freelance reporter from Scripps-Howard Broadcasting (which operated WEWS-TV in Cleveland) who had brought a movie camera into the fair. Zacchini asked the reporter not to film his act. The reporter did not film Zacchini's act that day, but did film him the next day. The footage taken by the reporter was about fifteen seconds long, sufficient to capture Zacchini's entire act.\n\nZacchini filed suit against Scripps-Howard in Ohio state court, alleging that the local reporter \"showed and commercialized the film of his act without his consent,\" and that such conduct was an \"unlawful appropriation of plaintiff's professional property.\" The trial court granted the defendant summary judgment. The Ohio Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Zacchini's complaint stated a cause of action for conversion and for infringement of a common law copyright, and that the press was not privileged to show Zacchini's entire act on television without compensating him.\n\nThe case was then heard by the Ohio Supreme Court, who reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals in favor of Scripps-Howard. The Ohio Supreme Court held that although Scripps-Howard would be liable for appropriating Zacchini's name, likeness, and performance, \n\nA TV station has a privilege to report in its newscasts matters of legitimate public interest which would otherwise be protected by an individual's right of publicity, unless the actual intent of the TV station was to appropriate the benefit of the publicity for some nonprivileged private use, or unless the actual intent was to injure the individual.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court granted \"certiorari\" to determine whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments immunized respondent from damages for its alleged infringement of Zacchini's right of publicity under Ohio state law.\n\nJustice White wrote for the majority. He held first that, because the Ohio Supreme Court based its decision on the scope of protection offered to the press by the Federal constitution (rather than the Ohio state constitution), no adequate and independent state ground existed for the Ohio Supreme Court's decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court therefore had jurisdiction.\n\nMoving on to the substantive constitutional issue of the case, White disagreed with the Ohio Supreme Court that the press should be privileged in showing Zacchini's entire act. He distinguished this case from \"Time, Inc. v. Hill\", the U.S. Supreme Court case upon which the Ohio Supreme Court relied in their opinion. \"Time, Inc. v. Hill\" was a case which dealt with the tort of \"false light\", i.e. portraying a person in a misleading or embarrassing manner, rather than the appropriation of a performer's act or likeness, which was at stake there. White analogized Zacchini's interest in protecting his act from being shown without his permission to those interests protected by patent and copyright: Zacchini not only had a commercial interest in being compensated for the time and effort involved in his performance, but also the \"economic incentive for him to make the investment required to produce a performance of interest to the public\". White concluded by saying that while a state government may pass a law shielding the press from liability for broadcasting performers' acts, the First and Fourteenth amendments do not require the states to do so.\n\nJustice Powell, joined by justices Brennan and Marshall, disagreed with the standard set forth by the majority. Powell felt that the majority concentrated too heavily on the fact that the footage which was broadcast constituted Zacchini's \"entire act\" (which, Powell noted, was a rather uncertain standard in itself), rather than examining the purpose for which the footage was used. Since the footage was used for the purpose of reporting news, rather than for commercial exploitation, Powell asserted that the television station's use of the footage should be considered privileged from liability. He worried that the majority's holding may have a chilling effect on freedom of the press:\n\nThe Court's holding that the station's ordinary news report may give rise to substantial liability has disturbing implications, for the decision could lead to a degree of media self-censorship. Hereafter, whenever a television news editor is unsure whether certain film footage received from a camera crew might be held to portray an \"entire act,\" he may decline coverage – even of clearly newsworthy events – or confine the broadcast to watered-down verbal reporting, perhaps with an occasional still picture. The public is then the loser. This is hardly the kind of news reportage that the First Amendment is meant to foster.\n\nJustice Stevens wrote a separate dissent. He felt that a better resolution of the case would have been to remand it back to the Ohio Supreme Court for clarification of the state law issue before attempting to resolve the constitutional issue. Stevens felt that it was not clear whether the Ohio Supreme Court was basing its holding purely on the boundaries of common law torts or the First Amendment.\n\n"}
