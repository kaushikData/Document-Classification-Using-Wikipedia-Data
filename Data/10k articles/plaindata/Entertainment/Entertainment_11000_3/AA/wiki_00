The series focuses on players establishing colonies on a series of small islands, conducting exploration of the region, diplomacy and trade with other civilisations and traders, while managing resources and engaging in combat both on land and sea. Most games in the series take place during Renaissance and Empire-building historical periods of Earth's history, with cultures, architecture and customs based upon real-life elements from these periods, though in-game civilisations tend to be neutral from exact nations. The more recent titles focused upon future periods of Earth's history around possible \"what if\" scenarios based upon current issues.\n\nEach game in the series is mainly a stand-alone title, featuring the same level of reoccurring gameplay mechanics, though with each instalment amending existing gameplay mechanics and adding new features, with expansions packs adding in further content. Initial games mainly focused on two modes of gameplay, with players able to operate in single-player or multiplayer over LAN or online connections, while later titles added in a campaign mode of several missions, each featuring their own unique storyline - plots usually focus on players becoming involved in a major incident while beginning life as the ruler of a small island.\n\nWhile primarily developed for PC, the series has also included a variety of spin-off titles mainly for handheld consoles, which in turn feature more simplified game mechanics to those of the main series. Each title over the series' history has featured a variety of different developers and publishers, with the most recent entries being currently developed by Blue Byte and published by Ubisoft. Most entries in the series have received favourable reviews from critics over gameplay mechanics. The first title, \"Anno 1602\", was Germany's best-selling computer game of all time as of December 2002, with sales of 2.5 million copies worldwide and 1.7 million in the German market. Its sequel broke several of its sales records, becoming Germany's fastest-selling game and fastest full-price computer game to reach 500,000 domestic sales. It ultimately sold over one million units in German-speaking countries, and, when combined with its predecesor, reached 4.5 million sales worldwide by October 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "254878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254878", "title": "Audio mastering", "text": "Audio mastering\n\nMastering, a form of audio post production, is the process of preparing and transferring recorded audio from a source containing the final mix to a data storage device (the master), the source from which all copies will be produced (via methods such as pressing, duplication or replication). In recent years digital masters have become usual, although analog masters, such as audio tapes, are still being used by the manufacturing industry, notably by a few engineers who have chosen to specialize in analog mastering.\n\nMastering requires critical listening; however, software tools exist to facilitate the process. Results still depend upon the intent of the engineer, the accuracy of the speaker monitors, and the listening environment. Mastering engineers may also need to apply corrective equalization and dynamic compression in order to optimise sound translation on all playback systems. It is standard practice to make a copy of a master recording, known as a safety copy, in case the master is lost, damaged or stolen.\n\nIn the earliest days of the recording industry, all phases of the recording and mastering process were entirely achieved by mechanical processes. Performers sang and/or played into a large acoustic horn and the master recording was created by the direct transfer of acoustic energy from the diaphragm of the recording horn to the mastering lathe, typically located in an adjoining room. The cutting head, driven by the energy transferred from the horn, inscribed a modulated groove into the surface of a rotating cylinder or disc. These masters were usually made from either a soft metal alloy or from wax; this gave rise to the colloquial term \"waxing\", referring to the cutting of a record.\n\nAfter the introduction of the microphone and electronic amplifier in the mid-1920s, the mastering process became electro-mechanical, and electrically driven mastering lathes came into use for cutting master discs (the cylinder format by then having been superseded). Until the introduction of tape recording, master recordings were almost always cut direct-to-disc. Only a small minority of recordings were mastered using previously recorded material sourced from other discs.\n\nIn the late 1940s, the recording industry was revolutionized by the introduction of magnetic tape. Magnetic tape was invented for recording sound by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928 in Germany, based on the invention of magnetic wire recording by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Not until the end of World War II could the technology be found outside Europe. The introduction of magnetic tape recording enabled master discs to be cut separately in time and space from the actual recording process.\n\nAlthough tape and other technical advances dramatically improved audio quality of commercial recordings in the post-war years, the basic constraints of the electro-mechanical mastering process remained, and the inherent physical limitations of the main commercial recording media—the 78 rpm disc and later the 7-inch 45 rpm single and 33-1/3 rpm LP record—meant that the audio quality, dynamic range, and running time of master discs were still limited compared to later media such as the compact disc.\n\nFrom the 1950s until the advent of digital recording in the late 1970s, the mastering process typically went through several stages. Once the studio recording on multi-track tape was complete, a final mix was prepared and dubbed down to the master tape, usually either a single-track mono or two-track stereo tape. Prior to the cutting of the master disc, the master tape was often subjected to further electronic treatment by a specialist mastering engineer. \n\nAfter the advent of tape it was found that, especially for pop recordings, master recordings could be made so that the resulting record would sound better. This was done by making fine adjustments to the amplitude of sound at different frequency bands (equalization) prior to the cutting of the master disc. Record mastering became a highly prized and skilled craft, and it was widely recognized that good mastering could make or break a commercial pop recording. As a result, the independent mastering studio was born. Early independent mastering engineers included Doug Sax, Bob Ludwig, Bob Katz and Bernie Grundman and Denny Purcell.\n\nIn large recording companies such as EMI, the mastering process was usually controlled by specialist staff technicians who were conservative in their work practices. These big companies were often reluctant to make changes to their recording and production processes. For example, EMI was very slow in taking up innovations in multi-track recording and they did not install 8-track recorders in their Abbey Road Studios until the late 1960s, more than a decade after the first commercial 8-track recorders were installed by American independent studios.\n\nIn the 1990s, electro-mechanical processes were largely superseded by digital technology, with digital recordings stored on hard disk drives or digital tape and mastered to CD. The digital audio workstation (DAW) became common in many mastering facilities, allowing the off-line manipulation of recorded audio via a graphical user interface (GUI). Although many digital processing tools are common during mastering, it is also very common to use analog media and processing equipment for the mastering stage. Just as in other areas of audio, the benefits and drawbacks of digital technology compared to analog technology are still a matter for debate. However, in the field of audio mastering, the debate is usually over the use of digital versus analog signal processing rather than the use of digital technology for storage of audio.\n\nDigital systems have higher performance and allow mixing to be performed at lower maximum levels. With peaks between -3 and -9 dBFS on a mix, the mastering engineer has enough headroom to process and produce a final master. It is important to allow enough headroom for the mastering engineer's work. Reduction of headroom by the mix or mastering engineer has resulted in a loudness war in commercial recordings.\n\nThe source material, ideally at the original resolution, is processed using equalization, compression, limiting and other processes. Additional operations, such as editing, specifying the gaps between tracks, adjusting level, fading in and out, noise reduction and other signal restoration and enhancement processes can also be applied as part of the mastering stage. The source material is put in the proper order, commonly referred to as assembly (or 'track') sequencing. These operations prepare the music for either digital or analog, e.g. vinyl, replication.\n\nIf the material is destined for vinyl release, additional processing, such as dynamic range reduction or frequency dependent stereo–to–mono fold-down and equalization, may be applied to compensate for the limitations of that medium. Finally, for compact disc release, Start of Track, End of Track, and Indexes are defined for disc navigation. Subsequently, it is rendered either to a physical medium, such as a CD-R or DVD-R, or to computer files, such as a Disc Description Protocol (DDP) file set or an ISO file. The specific medium varies, depending on the intended release format of the final product. For digital audio releases, there is more than one possible master medium, chosen based on replication factory requirements or record label security concerns. Regardless of what delivery method is chosen, the replicator will transfer the audio to a glass master that will generate metal stampers for replication.\n\nThe process of audio mastering varies depending on the specific needs of the audio to be processed. Mastering engineers need to examine the types of input media, the expectations of the source producer or recipient, the limitations of the end medium and process the subject accordingly. General rules of thumb can rarely be applied.\n\nSteps of the process typically include the following:\n\nExamples of possible actions taken during mastering:\n\nTo finish mastering a CD, track markers must be inserted, along with International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) and other information necessary to replicate a CD. Vinyl LP and cassettes have their own pre-duplication requirements for a finished master.\n\nMastering has a special significance for house, techno and other styles of electronic dance music:\n"}

She is usually depicted as a supporting character in the Spider-Man series.\n\nCreated by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Sally Avril first appeared in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15 (1962). Sally was a minor member of Flash Thompson's entourage, appearing in only one issue during the Silver Age. Her \"Bluebird\" career was created by Busiek (scripts) and Olliffe (pencils) in 1996.\n\nSally Avril was a fellow student of Peter Parker's at Midtown High who turned him down for a date, preferring the more handsome and muscular Flash Thompson.\n\nThirty years later, writing for \"Untold Tales of Spider-Man\", Kurt Busiek resurrected the one-note brunette from obscurity and gave her a background. She was an ambitious, thrill-loving girl who took blue ribbons in gymnastics. With fellow popular kid Jason Ionello, she attempted to cash in on a \"Daily Bugle\" contest offering a thousand dollars to a reader who brought in pictures of Spider-Man. Although their mission was a bust, Sally loved the thrill and became very smitten with the web-slinger when he touched her cheek just before leaving her and Jason with a warning to give it up.\n\nSally and Jason tailed Spidey again, who was (unwillingly) working for Electro. The flash from Sally's camera roused Spidey from his hypnotic state, and a well-placed kick by the athletic young Sally took Electro by surprise long enough for Spidey to readjust his mask — which Electro had been preparing to remove — and defeat him. Spider-Man posed for a shot with an ecstatic Sally and Jason that the \"Bugle\" ran.\n\nSuffused with glee, Sally tried to get a permanent gig on the \"Bugle\", but was told the photographer's job was filled — by Peter Parker. Peter admitted this but asked her not to tell their fellow Midtowners. Sally donned an eccentric blue-and-white costume and decided, with her aerobic skills, to become a superheroine. She asked Peter to take some \"Bugle\" pics of her doing some stunts, but Peter refused. Angered, she threatened to blackmail him by revealing that he took Spider-Man pictures, but he undercut her by telling them himself.\n\nBluebird's zeal but lack of experience caused trouble for Spider-Man during fights with Scarlet Beetle and Electro. Her \"ether egg\" weapons would detonate prematurely or have little effect, once even allowing the villain to escape. Considering her more trouble than she was worth, Spider-Man allowed the Black Knight's men to hurt her quite badly in order to dissuade her from interfering in his fights again, although he later felt remorseful.\n\nBruised but undaunted, Sally and Jason headed to an area where Spider-Man was fighting the Black Knight, with Sally's camera. She intended to capture some shots of the fight. However, Sally's zeal ended up costing her her life when she begged Jason to speed in his car, and the two ran a red light. Their car struck an oncoming bus, with Jason incurring mild head trauma, and Sally being killed.\n\nSpider-Man felt horrible about this. \"She'll never laugh again... She'll never toss her head the way she did, instantly dismissing whatever she didn't want to think about in favor of something new. She'll never smile, never capture everyone's attention with a few words, never light up a room with her determination and humor. She could be obnoxious, even pushy, but she was vital and alive and fun to be around and now she's gone.\"\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Sally Avril is cloned by Ben Reilly posing as Jackal and is seen in New U Technologies' facility area called Haven.\n\nBluebird possessed no superhuman powers and used the following gadgets to fight crime: a retractable rope-line, insulated boots to protect her from electricity, blue paint pellets and ether-filled \"eggs\". Avril was also a skilled gymnast.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a puzzle game which uses the 'rocks and diamonds' mechanics of \"Boulder Dash\".\n\nThe player controls a dragon called Bono, who operates a soap business. He collects bones from around the chambers of his castle and uses them to make soap in a cauldron. He then delivers the soap to sea-monsters, situated at various exits from the castle.\n\nThe game uses the 'rocks and diamonds' mechanics as popularised in the game \"Boulder Dash\", and Superior's own \"Repton\" series, whereby the player can dig through earth and push boulders but where boulders will fall from above if area below them is cleared. The main difference in this game is that, although the characters are depicted in side profile, the camera is meant to be overhead so objects are not subject to gravity in the same way. The 'boulders' are living creatures known as Glooks and rather than just heading down the screen, they will head in the direction of a bathing sea-monster. As such, they change direction during play which changes the layout of the maze. This means the player must decide the order that the soap is delivered. Glooks are generally harmless but can crush the player when they move.\n\nThere are two other deadly creatures in the castle: monsters and spiders. Monsters can be trapped by pushing Glooks onto them. If they can't move, they turn to skeletons which Bono can collect to make soap. They can also be lured into trapdoors but then their bones are lost. Spiders, as well as being deadly to Bono, eat skeletons.\n\nAnother character in the game is Bono's assistant Fozzy who can be used to hold back monsters or spiders but can become trapped. There are also keys and doors and on each level a hidden 'volcano' that will spew out Glooks if walked over.\n\nIt takes five skeletons to make a bar of soap and five bars of soap must be created, and delivered to the sea-monsters, in each chamber. There are 22 chambers in the castle.\n\nThe game was designed by German programmer Andreas Kemnitz, originally for the Commodore 64. He submitted the game to Superior Software, who had recently published the similar \"Repton 3\" on the C64. Superior commissioned conversions to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron, machines on which they were market leaders, and also Amiga. All versions of the game are almost identical, with no real changes for the 16-bit Amiga version. The game was launched before Christmas 1987 with all four versions being advertised but the Amiga version was delayed, finally getting released in Spring 1988.\n\nThe BBC and Electron versions were included on the \"Play It Again Sam 7\" compilation in 1989 and reissued as part of the Superior/Blue Ribbon budget series in 1990.\n\nThe game received mostly positive reviews but there was a mixed response. ACE gave the C64 version a score of 943 (out of 1000) and the Amiga version 948. Electron User gave an overall score of 9/10, particularly praising the humour of the game and the \"beautifully animated\" sprites. The Games Machine also picked out the character animation for praise in their review of the BBC Micro and C64 versions and while generally positive, awarding a score of 70%, the review questions the relevance of this type of game; \"\"Bone Cruncher\" is an old-style game and its general aim is a little tired by today's standards. However, it is cleverly designed, presents sufficient challenge for worthy gameplay and the creatures' representation adds considerable charm\". When reviewing the Amiga version, they gave a lower score of 61% as while conceding it \"plays just as well as the 8-bit game\", the fact that \"it lacks any attempt at improvement\" on a much more capable machine was considered a mistake.\n\nZzap!64 were less impressed, giving a score of 56% and concluding that the game is a \"polished, but merely average addition to an already jaded format\". C+VG, reviewing the C64 version, went further, saying the game is \"antiquated\" and \"a load of dross\", awarding only 5/10 for playability and 4/10 for sound, graphics and value.\n\n"}

It may or may not have professional audio monitoring capability. Unlike a television set, a video monitor has no tuner (television) and, as such, is unable independently to tune into an over-the-air broadcast like a television receiver.

For quality control purposes, it is necessary for a broadcast reference monitor to produce (reasonably) consistent images from facility to facility, to reveal any flaws in the material, and also not to introduce any image artifacts (such as aliasing) that is not in the source material. Broadcast monitors will try to avoid post processing such as a video scaler, line doubling and any image enhancements such as dynamic contrast. However, display technologies with fixed pixel structures (e.g. LCD, plasma) must perform image scaling when displaying SD signals as the signal contains non-square pixels while the display has square pixels. LCDs and plasmas are also inherently progressive displays and may need to perform deinterlacing on interlaced video signals.\n\nSome professional video broadcast monitors display information on screen, the current video signal format, they might be receiving i.e.: standard definition formats like 576i, 480i or high definition formats like 720p or 1080p. They also have mechanical buttons to toggle common aspect ratios like ( or ), and underscanning or overscanning a picture to see lines in the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of video, and check if subtitles in VBI were inserted properly or not.

It is the national martial art of Trinidad & Tobago. French planters with their slaves, free coloreds and mulattos from neighboring islands of Grenada, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Dominica migrated to Trinidad during the Cedula of Population. Carnival had arrived with the French; slaves who could not participate formed a parallel celebration called canboulay, the precursor for Trinidad's Carnival. After Emancipation of slavery, a lead vocalist or chantwell (\"chantuelle\") would sing call-and-response chants called \"lavways\" lionizing and cheering on champion stickfighters. There, Carnival songs are considered to be derived from calinda chants and \"lavways\". This form of music gradually evolved into the modern calypso.\n\nBefore the Emancipation from slavery and its integration into Carnival, Calinda was used as a type of performance to provide ways of entertainment for slaves. Once the French came to Trinidad, stick fighters were no longer known as stick men but as boismen (bois meaning stick in French). There were different factors involved in stick fighting, including a costume that the performers would have to wear and the gayelles (or arenas) they would fight in. There are also special rituals that are done in the gayelle before the fight starts that include different ceremonial songs. \n\nThough it is more commonly practiced as a dance because of the violent outcome of stick-fighting, its roots are still that of a martial art originating from Kingdom of Kongo, and stick-fights still occur in Trinidad.

The \"Street Fighter\" tournament held at the Canada Cup has been a Premier Event of the Capcom Pro Tour since 2015. David \"Atari\" Bibona noted in 2014 that the Canada Cup is the biggest gathering of high-level \"Super Street Fighter II Turbo\" players, in part due to its international focus, allowing American players to compete with Japanese competitors, where \"Super Street Fighter II Turbo\" has a more active scene.\n\n\"Motherboard\" described the Canada Cup in 2016 as the \"largest and most prestigious fighting game tournament in the country.\"\n\nThe Canada Cup started in 2009 as the Calgary Cup, held in Calgary rather than Toronto. The tournament was rebranded as the Canada Cup the following year as top \"Street Fighter\" players like Daigo Umehara and Justin Wong flew in to compete in the competition. In 2011, Duong decided to charge Twitch.tv viewers of the tournaments $8.95 USD for commercial-free, high-definition livestreams, which became a running gag among the fighting game community.

She was also an instructor and deputy principal of the \"Dramatens elevskola\". She belonged to the elite actors of the Royal Dramatic Theater.\n\nCharlotta Eriksson was the natural daughter of Christina Halling. Her original surname was Lambert, and is traditionally claimed to be the daughter of an innkeeper with the surname Lambert, but her father is likely to have been P. J. Lambert, concert master of the theater, to whom her mother worked as a maid by the time of her birth. In 1797 her mother married Emanuel Ericsson, a servant of the royal household and later a pad maker, and Charlotta took the name of her stepfather.\n\nShe was enrolled as a student in the acting school \"Dramatens elevskola\" in 1805.\n\nCharlotta Eriksson was engaged as a premier actress at the Royal Dramatic Theatre 1 April 1812. The same year, she married Johan Fredrik Wikström (1779-1865), master of the choir of the Royal Swedish Opera, and was known as Charlotta Wikström until her divorce in 1821 when she, in accordance with the custom of divorced women at the time, took the name and title of Mrs Eriksson. The cause of her divorce was her wish to marry her lover, the actor Edvard du Puy, whose death in 1822 caused her to temporary retire from the stage in the spring and summer that year.\n\nCharlotta Eriksson was foremost a dramatic actress. However, as was the custom at the time of the royal theatres (the Royal Swedish Opera and the Royal Dramatic Theater), an actor could participate in lyric performances if they were able, and Eriksson is known to have participated in some opera performances, notably as a Papagena in \"Trollflöjten\" by Mozart (30 maj 1812).\n\nOne of her first successes was in 1820, when she played Ophelia instead of Carolina Kuhlman and praised for her realistic interpretation of insanity. In May 1821, Charlotta Eriksson had one of her greatest successes when she played the title role in the Swedish premier of Mary Stuart by Schiller, and are referred to as one of the greatest stars of the Royal Dramatic Theater of her generation alongside Nils Almlöf, Ulrik Torsslow and Sara Torsslow. Among her more noted roles were Beata Trolle in P. A. Granbergs \"Svante Sture och Märta Lejonhufvud\" (1812), Sally in \"Hartford och Sally\" by Zschokke (1814), Sofia in A. F. Skjöldebrands \"Herman von Unna\" (1817) and one of the norns in \"Balder\" by J. D. Valerius (1819), the title role of \"Preciosa\" by Weber-Wolffs (1824) and Ophelia in \"Hamlet\" (1824), Luise in Schillers \"Kabal och kärlek\" (1833), title role of \"Thérése eller den fader- och moderlösa flickan från Geneve\" by V. Ducange (1820), Berta örindur in Adolf Müllners \"Skulden\" (1830). \nA role often mentioned in connection to her, and which made a great impression in the audience, was her role in \"Sömngångaren\" ('Sleepwalker') by Piccini, in which she walked, talked and finally danced without showing any feelings whatsoever, in an interpretation of a sleepwalker.\n\nCharlotta Eriksson was foremost appreciated within the genre of French salon comedies, a very popular genre at the time in which she was often given the main women roles and performed them with success, becoming a star of the genre. \nA typical role of that kind was her role of Amelie in\"Trettio år af en spelares lefnad\" ('Thirty years of a gamlers life') by Ducange and Dinaux (1833), in which she was reviewed in \"Aftonbladet\": »Mrs E. developed more warmth, intensity and nuance as Amelie than normally found in her in roles of pathetic nature, and was as interesting in every aspect of it without being alike in one.\"\n\nAs an actor, Eriksson was described as a follower of the by then newly introduced realistic way of acting: because she lacked the ability to perform with the old fashioned melodramatic way in which such roles were still depicted, she was not considered to be of use within tragedy, but her natural way of acting was seen as perfect for the modern acting method, which was then very much appreciated within comic drama. She made several trips to study drama in France and Italy, where she reportedly regarded Mademoiselle Mars as a role model, and she is alongside Sara Torsslow, Ulrik Torsslow and Nils Almlöf credited with being one of the role models of the realistic acting method which replaced the old 18th-century stylistic acting method in 19th-century Sweden.\n\nDescribed as \"a clear and above all vivid intellect, an uncommon general knowledge and a by then unusually natural way of acting, which in combination with an appearance very much to her advantage and high quality sense of costume made her much appreciated by the audience as a cultivated lady within salon comedy.\" \nShe was generally given good reviews by critics, which were fairly consistent with each other her entire career. A typical review was that given in \"Dagligt Allehanda\" of her performance in the title role of \"Louise de Lignerolles\" by av Dinaux and Légouvé (1839), she was seen as typifying the modern style and as a role model for it: \n\"As for the acting, we do full justice to the admirable way in which Mrs E performed the title role. In it she displayed all the qualities which typifies the French or more correctly the Marsian school which even in the most intense moments never neglect confidence and elegance in posture, and an acting, studied and skillfully performed in the finest nuances but still so natural that hardly even a trace was visible of any conscious effort. In these parts of the art Mrs E deserve to be hold out as a role model.\" \nPrivate critics review her in a similar way. Marianne Ehrenström described Charlotta Eriksson as a woman with natural grace who was much loved as an actress, and M. J. Crusenstolpe said of her: \"Mrs E. can be photographically painted with one word: elegance. It passed through her entire being, expressed itself in her every gesture, was evident in her dress, always new but never overloaded with ostentation and gewgaw.\"\n\nIn contemporary press, the star actresses Sara Torsslow, Charlotta Eriksson and Elise Frösslind were compared to a rose or a tulip, a jasmine or a daisy, and a lily or a forget-me-not, by which Torsslow was claimed to represent \"The Deeply Moving\", Eriksson \"The Sensitive Grace and Feminine Gracefulness\" and Frösslind \"The Timid Sweetness, Wit and Naivety\". \nHer position was illustrated by her income: in 1834, she was given a salary of 1.600 in comparison to the average actress salary of 200, a salary equal to the prima donna of the Royal Opera Henriette Widerberg, and not much lower than the highest paid male colleague, which was 1.800.\n\nCharlotta Eriksson participated in the great strike known as the First Torsslow Argument, and signed an article of protest along with several other of the most influential actors 4 July 1828 against initiated financial reforms which caused great attention in the press, but returned to her position when the demands of the strike was met and the reforms stopped. When the same reforms was introduced in 1834, she joined the second strike known as the Second Torsslow Argument, but this time the strike failed and several of the participants were fired. Charlotta Eriksson lost her position at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, officially because the theater management claimed they could no longer afford her. She was for a time active at the \"Djurgårdsteatern\". She was however missed by the audience at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, the decision to fire her was considered to be hasty and there were demands that she should be engaged there again. The theater monopoly of the royal theaters inside the city borders of the capital made it difficult to secure employment, and in 1836, she asked to be taken back by the management of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, which immediately accepted, but lowered her salary from 1600 to 825. Her acceptance of a re engagement at the Royal Dramatic Theatre was reportedly med with \"a common satisfaction\".\n\nUpon her return, Eriksson was initially forced to replace Sara Torsslow in the women main roles of tragedies, which exposed her to bad reviews for a while as the genre was not considered suited for her, until these roles were taken over by Emilie Högqvist, who became the new star within Torsslow's former repertoire. Eriksson could now return to her own repertoire, and the remainder of her career was successful.\n\nDuring this period, she was gradually replaced by Emilie Högqvist in the heroine roles of the French salon comedies. When Högqvist was given the role of Victorine by Dumersan, Gabriel and Dupeuty (1836), a review in \"Teater och Musik\" wrote: \nHowever, she belonged to the theaters' elite actors until her retirement and her late successes was Catherine II in Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffers' \"Favorite\" (1841) and Duchess of Marlborough in Scribes \"A Glass of Water\" (1841). In 1838, the paper \"Freja\" praised her as \"far superior to all the other actresses\" of the Royal Dramatic Theatre.\n\nAside from her activity as an actress, Charlotta Eriksson was also active as a translator, and translated several plays from the French language to Swedish, which was then staged at the Royal Dramatic Theatre. She was also active as a deputy principal and an instructor of declamation at the \"Dramatens elevskola\" in 1837-1841.\n\nCharlotta Eriksson retired from the Royal Dramatic Theatre after the 1841-42 season with a full pension.\n\nAlso after he retirement, Charlotta Eriksson was active onstage because of her interest of acting, though she no longer had financial reasons to work. She occasionally made sporadic guest performances in smaller theaters as well as at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, such as the travelling theaters of A. G. Wallins and W. T. Gilles, and at the \"Mindre teatern\" in the season of 1847-48, where she \"continued to be what she has always been – an example for every younger actress.\" She made another season at the Mindre Teatern in 1849-50 and finally made her last performance at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1855, when she reportedly retained all the popularity of her audience.\n\nAside from her stage activity she traveled during her retirement, and witnessed the siege of Milan during the Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states.\nShe spent several years in Italy, and finally settled in Düsseldorf in Germany, where her son studied art. She studied art with him and died there in 1862.\n\n"}

But the cifra is mainly the song of the \"payadores\" (singers from Argentinian Pampa) who improvise in opposition. The way in which this interrupted song is combined and linked to the strumming of the guitar is the most characteristic of it and, unique singularity in American songbooks. In fact, the song dialogues with the guitar. A series of strummed chords serves as a prelude. When the singer raises his voice, the guitar goes silent. Once one or two verses are finished, the strumming or some grave note punctuated by a brief interlude breaks again, and thus, the verse runs to the end. No having measure for interludes or account for repetitions of verses, the form is more or less free. In the best times of the genre, it was used as a confrontation between two singers to change sharp questions or answers in strophe. While strumming the initial prelude, the payador thinks about his first question and, launched to sing the verses, interrupts and interludes as much as he needs to continue thinking about the idea or the versification; keep it up until it complete the thought and stanza. At that moment his opponent choose the verse of the question and initiates his response in the same way. An improviser is all the more skilled the less the number of repetitions and interludes required to be versed.\n\n"}

{"id": "556411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=556411", "title": "Clone High", "text": "Clone High\n\nClone High (occasionally referred to in the U.S. as Clone High U.S.A.) is a Canadian–American adult animated television series created by Phil Lord, Christopher Miller and Bill Lawrence. The comedy centers on a high school populated by the clones of famous historical figures. The show's central cast includes adolescent depictions of Abraham Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Mahatma Gandhi, John F. Kennedy, and Cleopatra. The series also serves as a parody of teen dramas; every episode is introduced as a \"very special episode\".\n\nLord and Miller first developed the series' concept while at Dartmouth College in the 1990s, later pitching it to executives at American network Fox Broadcasting Company, who ultimately decided to pass on the program. It was later purchased by cable channel MTV, and was produced between 2002–03. The show's design is heavily stylized and its animation style limited, emphasizing humor and story over visuals. The \"Clone High\" theme song was written by Tommy Walter and performed by his alternative rock band Abandoned Pools, who also provided much of the series' background music.\n\n\"Clone High\" first aired in its entirety on Canadian cable network Teletoon between 2002 and 2003, later debuting on MTV. It became embroiled in a controversy regarding its depiction of Gandhi soon afterward, which prompted hundreds in India to mount a hunger strike in response. Shortly after, MTV pulled the series, which had been receiving low ratings. \"Clone High\" attracted mixed reviews from television critics upon its premiere, but it has since received critical acclaim and a cult following.\n\n\"Clone High\" is set in a high school in the fictional town of Exclamation, USA, that is secretly being run as an elaborate military experiment orchestrated by a government office called the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures. The school is entirely populated by the clones of famous historical figures that have been created and raised with the intent of having their various strengths and abilities harnessed by the United States military. The principal of the high school, Cinnamon J. Scudworth, has his own plans for the clones, and secretly tries to undermine the wishes of the Board (Scudworth wants to use the clones to create a clone-themed amusement park, dubbed \"Cloney Island\", a decidedly less evil intention than that of the Board). He is assisted by his robot butler/vice principal/dehumidifier, Mr. Butlertron (a parody of \"Mr. Belvedere\"), who is programmed to call everyone \"Wesley\" and speak in two distinct intonations.\n\nThe main protagonists of \"Clone High\" are the clones of Abraham Lincoln (referred to as \"Abe\"), Joan of Arc, and Mahatma Gandhi. Much of the plot of the show revolves around the attempts of Abe to woo the vain and promiscuous clone of Cleopatra, while being oblivious to the fact that his friend Joan of Arc is attracted to him. Meanwhile, John F. Kennedy's clone (referred to as \"JFK\"), a macho, narcissistic womanizer, is also attempting to win over Cleopatra and has a long-standing rivalry with Abe. Gandhi acts in many of the episodes as the comic relief. Also on a few occasions, the characters that we see learn most of \"Life's Lessons\" the hard way.\n\nWhile the clones derive many character qualities from their ancestors, much of the humor in the show comes from the large contrast between the personality of the clones and the actual values and legacy of the historical figures they are descended from. For instance, Gandhi is portrayed as a hyperactive jerk-with-a-heart-of-gold whose biggest dream is to be accepted by those around him, in contrast to his historical legacy of calm nonviolence. Abe Lincoln is similarly portrayed as weak and indecisive, completely lacking the resolve of the President whose DNA he shares. All of the clones are also given mis-matched foster parents who have little in common with them. Gandhi's parents are a stereotypical Jewish-American couple, while JFK is raised by a homosexual, interracial couple; Joan's \"foster grandpa\" is an elderly blind musician similar to Ray Charles named Toots, a parody of the stereotypical wise old man role (and the magical negro role) found in many teen shows, and who begins many of his declarative sentences with the words, \"Now, I may be blind, but I can see...\" followed by a wise-sounding observation that has little or nothing to do with anything.\n\nThe show also includes humor based on the historical figures themselves. For example, the diner the clones frequent is called The Grassy Knoll, a reference to the JFK assassination conspiracy theory about a second shooter, dubbed \"The Man on the Grassy Knoll\". Other references seen are the flag at The Grassy Knoll being permanently at half mast and the car on the roof of the diner containing the original JFK's body leaning over the edge. There are pictures of assassinations hanging on the walls of the restaurant, such as the famous of the Lincoln assassination (though this version is in color and considerably more graphic than the original print). The genetic ancestors of all of the five main clones died of similarly irregular causes: three assassinations, one execution and one suicide. Other historical figure-based humor includes offhand coincidental remarks to other students, such as Abe mentioning that the clone of Napoleon is so annoying because of \"some kind of complex\", or Gandhi telling Catherine the Great to \"get off her high horse\".\n\nThe show is also a parody of \"issue\" episodes of high-school themed comedies. Each episode is introduced as a \"very special episode.\" Episodes center on various social issues, including Gandhi being shunned by his school for having ADD (because of misinformation about the disorder), parodying shows which tackle AIDS awareness (it even included a special guest celebrity who tries to educate the students). Other episodes tackle drugs (smoking raisins), the environment, and underage drinking in a similarly ridiculous fashion. In a clear sign that it is parodying the high school genre, it even ends at prom: a stereotypical \"high school show\" ending. Even the prom is a joke however, as we learn it is only the Winter Prom.\n\nThere was a running gag that creators Phil Lord and Christopher Miller wanted to include in the show \"where Clone High – being an exaggeration of typical high schools in teen dramas – would have many proms throughout the year\". Planned proms included \"an Early Winter Prom, a Late Winter/Early Spring Prom, a Mid-Semester Prom, a Post-Prom Clean Up Prom, etc\". The only surviving references to this joke are the Homecoming Prom in episode 6, \"Homecoming: A Shot in D'Arc\", and the winter prom in episode 13, \"Changes: The Big Prom: The Sex Romp: The Season Finale\". Another reference to the gag was deleted from episode 8, \"A Room of One's Clone: Pie of the Storm\".\n\n\nMiller initially developed the show's premise while in college, initially imagining the clones would be at a university rather than high school. The series was originally developed in 2000 under the title \"Clone High School, USA!\". The production was overseen by Touchstone Television. It was originally pitched to the Fox Broadcasting Company, who purchased the show immediately but ultimately decided not to order it to series. Miller deemed it the \"easiest pitch ever,\" considering the show's use of famous figures. Following Fox's rejection, MTV purchased the program in May 2001. All the original character designs were much different from what they would become even though the characters kept the same physical attributes and appearance. Each episode was budgeted at approximately $750,000.\n\nDespite being an MTV/Teletoon Co-production, the show was co-produced with Touchstone Television, marking as Disney's third adult animated series after \"The PJs\" and \"\".\n\nIn forming the show's central cast, they found themselves limited in the number of historical figures they could depict, in consideration with avoiding \"litigious estates\" (such as the families of Albert Einstein or Marilyn Monroe) and keeping in mind the viewership of MTV. The show also parodies teen dramas, such as \"Dawson's Creek\", which Lord and Miller watched in preparation to create the series. The show's art design has been described as angular and \"evocative of UPA at its best.\" It is characterized by a flat and very stylized appearance resembling the animation used in Cartoon Network animated series from the 1990s and early 2000s, such as \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"The Powerpuff Girls\" and \"Time Squad\" (Lord and Miller specifically cited \"Samurai Jack\" as an influence). The character designs were all done by Carey Yost, known for his work on \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"Samurai Jack\", \"The Powerpuff Girls\", \"The Ren & Stimpy Show\", and \"Timon & Pumbaa\". The characters and backgrounds were traditionally drawn, and frames and cels were frequently recycled. Co-creator Chris Miller explained, \"We like the snappy pose-to-pose animation, more for reasons of comic timing than anything else. Things that aren't expected are funnier: If an anvil's going to fall on your head, it had better not take more than three seconds. That's why we like the quick pose-to-pose stuff. For scenes with more emotional content, the characters move a little slower and more fluidly\". Phil Lord added, \"But we never want the viewer to be paying attention to the animation, because it's there to serve the jokes and the story. We strip out extraneous movements, because we don't want to draw your eye to anything that's not part of a joke.\" Gandhi is the most animated character on the show; he requires twice as many story-board poses as any other character.\n\nThe series was produced by Bill Lawrence, who also produced \"Scrubs\", \"Spin City\" and \"Cougar Town\". Many \"Scrubs\" alumni, such as Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke, John C. McGinley, Neil Flynn, and Christa Miller, provided the voices of characters in \"Clone High\".\n\n\"Clone High\" was notable for subtle jokes hidden in the animation. There is an image of a dolphin hidden in almost every episode. The use of dolphins (sounds or images) would be later featured in Lord and Miller's later work. In the episode \"Raisin the Stakes\", there were numerous hidden messages, which appeared to be a parody of subliminal messaging.\n\nAn article in \"Maxim\" Magazine depicting Mahatma Gandhi being beaten up by a muscular man sparked outrage in India. \"Clone High\" was caught in a crossfire when citizens in the country conducted internet searches on the Maxim article but also found out about the show's Gandhi character on MTV's website. This sparked an outrage in India over the show's depiction of Gandhi. On January 30, 2003, the 55th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination, approximately 150 protesters (including members of parliament) gathered in New Delhi and vowed to fast in response to \"Clone High\". Tom Freston, the head of Viacom (owner of MTV), was visiting the network's India branch and was \"trapped in the building,\" according to Miller. In 2014, he recalled that protestors \"basically threatened that they'd revoke MTV's broadcasting license in India if they didn't take the show off the air\".\n\nMTV offered a quick apology, stating that \"\"Clone High\" was created and intended for an American audience\", and \"we recognize and respect that various cultures may view this programming differently, and we regret any offense taken by the content in the show\". Miller would later recall that executives at MTV enjoyed the show, and asked for the duo to pitch a second season without Gandhi. Lord and Miller's two potential versions of a second season included one that made no mention of Gandhi's absence, and another that revealed that the character was, in fact, a clone of actor Gary Coleman all along, and the show continued as normal. \"We pitched that, and it went up to the top at Viacom again and it got a big no,\" he remembered.\n\nLord and Miller have since stated that they have \"considered\" a film adaptation of the series. In 2014, they explained that as they at that time were under contract with Fox, Lawrence had a television deal at Warner Bros. Television, and the rights to \"Clone High\" were owned by MTV/Viacom, it would be difficult to resurrect the show. References to \"Clone High\" are present in their later productions: the duo admitted many jokes in \"22 Jump Street\" were \"ripped off straight from \"Clone High\"\", and Forte also voices a Lego version of Lincoln in \"The Lego Movie\". In a 2014 Grantland article, the two joked that \"our entire career has just been about getting \"Clone High\" back on the air\".\n\nThe previous animated MTV series \"Daria\" and \"Beavis and Butt-head\" had used then-current popular music as a soundtrack, but, in contrast, \"Clone High\" featured a wide variety of music, usually exclusive to alternative rock, indie rock, midwest emo, hardcore punk pop rock, metalcore, from mostly unknown and underground bands and musicians; a previous MTV animated series, \"Undergrads\", had also done this. Of these include Alkaline Trio, American Football, Ritalin, Catch 22, Ilya, The Gentleman, Drex, Taking Back Sunday, The Stereo, Jo Davidson, Saves the Day, Hot Rod Circuit, Thursday, Helicopter Helicopter, Owen, Dashboard Confessional, Elf Power, Abandoned Pools, The Get Up Kids, Mink Lungs, Mates of State, Snapcase, The Mooney Suzuki, Jon DeRosa, Ephemera, Jinnrall, Avoid One Thing, DJ Cellulitis, DJ Piccolo, Whippersnapper, Matt Pond PA, Mad City and Bumblefoot. The series' other background music and original score was written and produced by Scott Nickoley and Jamie Dunlap of Mad City Productions. Nickoley and Dunlap went on to score other shows such as \"South Park\", \"The Osbournes\" and \"\".\n\nTelevision critics gave \"Clone High\" mixed reviews upon its 2002 premiere. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the show has a score of 60, based on seven reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". David Bianculli of the \"New York Daily News\" praised the series, commenting, \"In a year of variations and ripoffs of established themes and genres, it's a true original. It's also a cartoon, and is truly, outrageously bizarre.\" The \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" Rob Owen complimented the show: \"Yes, \"Clone High\" has the MTV-requisite sexual innuendo, but it's more clever than much of what passes for humor in prime time today. And like \"Scrubs\", it has heart, particularly when it comes to Abe and Joan.\" Anita Gates of \"The New York Times\" opined that \"the dialogue isn't always exactly funny, but it's smile worthy,\" observing, \"the characters are intriguing in a lightweight way but could lose their appeal fast.\" Scott Sandell of the \"Los Angeles Times\" felt the show's debut episode lacking: \"The problem is that the first episode, which focuses on crushes and beer, doesn't quite live up to the obvious comedic potential behind the killer premise.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" Michael Farkash felt similarly, writing, \"The premise sounds intriguing, but what hatches in the first episode is a disappointing, weak strain of comic material, lacking the cunning, subversive quality of, say, \"South Park\".\"\n\nBecause of the series' early cancellation in 2003, it quickly fell into obscurity, especially in the US. However, it has garnered a large fanbase throughout the Internet and still occasionally airs reruns on Teletoon's \"Teletoon at Night\" (formerly Teletoon Detour) block and formerly aired on MTV, MTV2 and Razer (now MTV2) in Canada. Much in Canada has also aired reruns of \"Clone High\" for a short time.\n\nHeather Marulli, of the website Television Without Pity, called the series \"a mini-masterpiece of the animated genre; an opus to the primetime cartoon\".\n\nDavid Broermann, from the website Freakin' Awesome Network, gave the series an \"A+\", saying it has \"some really really good character development and depth\" and an \"amazing soundtrack\" He notes the fantastic use of multiple running gags keeping viewers on their toes.\n\nCurrently, the show has an 8.7 rating on TV.com, has an 8.3 rating on IMDb, and is listed as #5 on IGN's \"Reader Choice: Top Animated Series\".\n\nJesse David Fox of \"Vulture\", in a retrospective piece on the series, wrote that \"\"Clone High\" still holds up more than a decade later as a brilliantly funny, completely nuts, surprisingly heartfelt, tonally inventive masterpiece.\"\n\nThe two-disc DVD complete series boxset was released in Canada by Nelvana with the help of Teletoon. The DVD contains the complete series, including the five episodes which did not originally air in the United States.\n\n"}

{"id": "40342376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40342376", "title": "Corral de comedias", "text": "Corral de comedias\n\nCorral de comedias, literally a \"theatrical courtyard\", is a type of open-air theatre specific to Spain. In Spanish all secular plays were called \"comedias\", which embraced three genres: tragedy, drama, and comedy itself. During the Spanish Golden Age, \"corrals\" became popular sites for theatrical presentations in the early 16th century, when the theater took on a special importance in the country. The performance was held in the afternoon and lasted two to three hours, there being no intermission, and few breaks. The entertainment was continuous, including complete shows with parts sung and danced. All spectators were placed according to their sex and social status.\n\nIn modern times, the first buildings devoted to the theater in Spain appeared in the 16th century. Representations of \"comedias\" were instead held in the courtyard of houses or inns where a stage with background scenery was improvised along one of the sides. The three remaining sides served as public galleries to the wealthy, with the remaining spectators watching the play from the open courtyard.\nThe courtyard structure was maintained in permanent theaters built for the purpose from the end of the sixteenth century, called \"corrales de comedias,\" which used the open-air enclosed rectangular courtyard typical of a block of houses. Playwrights and dramatists such as Lope de Vega, Juan Pérez de Montalbán, Tirso de Molina, and Pedro Calderón de la Barca created works which were performed in \"corrales de comedias.\"\n\nThe first permanent theater of this type, Corral de la Cruz, was constructed in Madrid in 1579. The number of theaters increased rapidly after 1600, responding to the public's enthusiasm for this new form of entertainment. The oldest surviving corral, albeit significantly altered, is the Corral de comedias de Alcalá de Henares. This \"corral\", formerly a courtyard theatre, has been roofed and used as a \"teatro romántico\" and a cinema, leading to major changes in the building's architecture.\nThe last known such courtyard theatre to be built in Spain, Corral de comedias de Almagro, in Almagro, Castile-La Mancha, is a purpose-built theater that dates to 1628. This only functioning courtyard theater still standing, once one among the many, annually celebrates the \"Festival Internacional de Teatro Clásico\" (International Classical Theatre Festival); \nThere are recently found remains of a corral in Torralba de Calatrava, which the municipality wished to rebuild in 2006. \n\nThe theatre type specific to Spain, was extended to Mexico when a \"corral de comedias\" was built in Tecali de Herrera around 1540.\n\nThe \"corrales\" present some parallels to Elizabethan theatre where productions were held in galleried inns. The George Inn, Southwark is a partially surviving example of such a structure.\nAs well as similarities as regards the type of buildings used, there were similarities in the subject matter of the plays: Spanish literature was translated into English in Shakespeare´s time, and in 1613 his company mounted a lost play called \"Cardenio\" which appears to have been based on an episode in \"Don Quixote\". \n\nAlthough Shakespeare was not translated into Spanish until the eighteenth century, his work has since been performed in the corrales; for example in 2016, which saw the quatercentenary of the deaths of Cervantes and Shakespeare, there were Shakespearean productions in Amalgro and Alcalá de Henares.\n\nThe stage was installed at one end of the court, against the back wall. In front of the stage was the outdoor patio at the end of which sat the so-called \"musketeers.\" The balconies and windows of the adjoining houses formed the quarters reserved for men and women of nobility. In Madrid, above the \"cazuela\", were the quarters of the councilors and other authorities, such as the chairman of the Council of Castile.\n\nOn the upper floors were the \"desvanes\" (attics), very small quarters, among which stood the tertulia of the church and a second \"cazuela.\" The stage and lateral galleries were protected by an overhang. An awning, hung from hooks, protected the men of the common public who sat in the patio from the sun, avoiding contrast between sunlit and shaded areas, such as was found on stage and in the courtyard. That probably also improved the acoustics of the venue, avoiding straining the voices of actors. This provision was similar to the Elizabethan theaters from the same period in England. In the earlier built corrals, there were no toilets: with the advent of \"new enlightened governments\" during the reign of Philip V, some \"corrales\" were closed due to hygiene issues, risk of fire or disorder. With the arrival of a bourgeois class who did not want to watch the plays in awkward spaces such as these, larger theatrical structures were constructed, which required confined spaces and specific acoustic treatment.\n\nDuring the Spanish Golden Age, any theatrical event was known as \"comedia\". The public came in masses for entertainments like this, whether comedy, drama or tragedy. The season of performances usually began on Easter Sunday, ending on Ash Wednesday. Smoking was forbidden because of the risk of fire, and from October to April the \"comedia\" began at two in the afternoon, in the spring at three and at four during summer, in order for all to finish before sunset. The performance's duration was approximately four to six hours, structured in six different rounds: the first act or \"loa\", the opening round, then an appetizer, the second round, the masquerade or \"jácaras\", a third round and the final act. Men and women could not sit together; men occupied the courtyard, side stands, the benches or the central stands, and the women watched the performance from their \"cazuelas\" above. The only place where they were allowed to be together was in the chamber corridors. Children were not allowed to attend. The audience paid fees at different points: at the entrance, then a tip to the \"brotherhood\" or beneficiary, and a third one for the privilege of a seat so they could watch the play comfortably. The theatrical company rarely received as much as 20% of the total. In university towns, it was forbidden to perform on weekdays, so the students would not be distracted. Two characters were instantly recognized in the \"corrales\": the \"mozo\", maintainer of order, equipped with a big garrote to calm the exited spectator, and the \"spacer\", that is, the one in charge of finding a suitable place for an individual in between two others. The first regulation on the operation of corrals was published by the Royal Council of Castile for the \"corrales\" of Madrid, later extended to the whole kingdom. Among its provisions, were the presence of a bailiff whose function was to ensure that no noise, tumults, or scandals ensued, and that men and women were kept separated in their respective seating by the required entrances and exits.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2973066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2973066", "title": "Drag show", "text": "Drag show\n\nA drag show is an entertainment which is performed by drag artists, both women and men.\n\nMany drag shows feature performers singing or lip-synching to songs while performing a pre-planned pantomime, or dancing. The performers often don elaborate costumes and makeup, and sometimes dress to imitate various famous opposite sex singers or personalities. And some events are centered around drag, such as Southern Decadence where the majority of festivities are led by the Grand Marshals, who are traditionally drag queens.\n\nMany drag performances have an agenda, whether it be through camp or comedy they often resist the hegemony by rejecting notions of heterosexism. Although drag performers are rejecting heterosexism they often times reinforce classism, racism, and sexism in their performances. \n\nThe first instances of drag were well before drag shows began. In England and China in the 1500's women were not allowed to participate in drama or theater so the men impersonated females when acting on stage. In the Victorian period English actresses impersonated men in theater, and in America actresses like Anne Hindle also impersonated men in her performances. She had a low voice and shaved regularly to create an masculine appearance. The impersonation of the opposite sex was popular in theater and film until 1933 when the Hollywood Motion Picture Production Code was passed. This law or code was established to eliminate perversion which temporarily ended the era of male impersonation in film and theater. \n\nThe first known drag balls of the United States were in Harlem in the 1920's, at the Rockland Palace. These shows are called balls and feature extravagant performances of gay's and lesbian's impersonating the opposite sex and competing against one another in fashion shows. It is important to note that Harlem drag balls were primarily people of color, white people were not excluded but did not typically participate. Drag balls were social event that brought people together who were on the margins of society and they often had to meet in secret.\n\nWomen of the Harlem Renaissance like Gladys Bentley, a prominent Blues singer, regularly wore tuxedos and dressed in mens clothing while performing. Butch African American women constructed their own forms of masculinity inside and outside of Blues performances which set the stage for future performers in drag. It wasn't until about 50 years later that the term drag king was coined and performances started popping up across the United States. According to Elizabeth Ashburn, \"A drag king is anyone, regardless of gender or sexual preference or orientation, who consciously makes a performance of masculinity.\" Therefore drag performers of the drag king scene typically identify as women but some may be cisgender men or transgender men.\n\nDuring World War II, parody drag shows were also a regular kind of entertainment for soldiers who dressed up as humorous-looking women and put on shows for each other. \n\nDoc Benner, and Danny Brown produced the show which started in Miami, Florida at a gay bar known as Club Jewel Box. This show would go on to set the stage for the touring drag show known as the Jewel Box Revue. The Jewel Box Revue was the longest running drag show that performed from the 1940's until the 1970's across the United States. They had at least ten specific performances in their repertoire, which was helpful for shows that ran for longer periods of time at the same place.The show had their own music and dances that were composed and choreographed for performers, they also did comedy sketches and some stand-up performances. The revue was made up of a diverse group that included African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and whites, which was unusual for the times before the Civil Rights Movement. \n\nMany of the venues they performed at were part of the \"chitlin' circuit\", the Howard Theatre (Washington D.C.) , the Baltimore-Royal Theatre, Uptown Theatre (Philadelphia) and the Regal Theater in Chicago. In 1959 they began performing at The Apollo Theater in New York City and it was always a full house when they came to town. \n\nIn the 1960's laws and regulations were put in place against cross-dressing and the Jewel Box Revue slowed down a bit. Although places like Los Angeles had bans in place they were still allowed to play at certain theaters. Ultimately the laws and regulations against cross-dressing made it difficult for the Jewel Box Revue to perform. \n\nIn 1975, the Jewel Box Revue performed for the last time in a production at the Bijou Theater in New York City. \n\nIn 1955 the Pearl Box Revue began it's performances in New York City. Pearl Box Revue was an all Black drag show that ran for twenty seven years until 1982. Dorian Corey was a performer in the Pearl Box Revue and also one of the drag queens in the documentary by Jennie Livingston known as \"Paris is Burning.\"\n\nDisposable Boy Toys (DBT) were a drag king group out of Santa Barbara, California. The group was started in May of 2000 and had 31 members, mostly white, queer and transgender, and were a feminist collective. Their performances were centered on dismantling racism, sexism, gender binaries, ideal bodies and even militarism and they mostly performed in queer spaces or progressive spaces for fundraising and marches Lip synching and dancing were regular components of their shows. DBT was known for performing at benefits to raise money for political and community causes. \n\nDBT disbanded in August of 2004, and although they did not officially break up they never performed together again.\n\n\"After Dark\" was a Swedish group founded in 1976 which performed for over 40 years, mostly in Sweden, but intermittantly also in the United States and Spain.\n\nProvincetown, Massachusetts is home to some of the most famous drag performers and in the summers months there are several performances on any given night. On July 24th 2018, Provincetown was home to the first ever Drag Camp, a camp for drag performers to hone in on their skills and perform for lives audiences. The camp lasted for two weeks (until August 4th 2018) and showcased famous drag performers. Jinkx Monsoon, Peaches Christ, and Raja were some of the most famous drag performers who attended Drag Camp and had their own workshops sessions on how to apply makeup, or comedic performance, amongst many others. The drag performances in Provincetown, also known as Ptown, are legendary, hence why Drag Camp landed there.\n\nDrag shows have become more popular with the documentary \"Paris is Burning,\" and shows like \"Rupaul's Drag Race.\" Films such as \"The Birdcage\" and \"Too Wong Fu, Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar\" have popularized drag culture too. These films along with Rupaul's Drag Race have a large heterosexual fanbase. \n\nA Drag Brunch is a type of drag show, in which drag kings and drag queens perform for an audience while the audience feasts on typical brunch foods and drinks.\n\nAlthough it is typically held at LGBTQ bars and nightclubs, restaurants have also become a popular site for drag brunches. Drag brunch is especially popular in urban centers with large gay populations, such as cities like New York City, Miami, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Quebec, and New Orleans. Drag historian and New York University professor, Joe E. Jeffreys, believes that drag brunch’s rise in popularity in recent years, is due to LGBTQ venues, such as Lucky Cheng’s, Lips NYC, and Club 82, that arose between the 1950s and 1990s. In an article titled \"The Importance of Drag Brunch in NYC\", Jeffery's claimed that these venues have the ability to expose people to drag, who might not have encountered it before.\n\n“[People] are able to sit at drag brunch and have a lovely spinach frittata and Bloody Mary while learning this lesson through observation. They start to understand that gender and drag aren't these scary things,” said Jeffreys. “It’s fun and festive like brunch can be.”\n\nIn an articled titled \"Dragging Herself To Brunch,\" Shawn Bodey, also known by his drag persona Robin Banks, describes drag brunch as dinner theater but for brunch. According to Bodey, dancing, singing and jokes about the gender binary, are some of the things one could expect to see at a drag brunch.\n\nIn cities across the country gospel drag brunches are also becoming increasingly popular. The drag venue Lips, which is based in New York City but has locations across the country, first started gospel drag brunches in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 2007. Other places, such as San Antonio, Texas, have also seen a rise in gospel drag brunches. In addition to food, drinks, and the usual performances one would expect to see at a drag brunch, gospel drag brunches also feature performers in choir robes doing renditions of classic gospel songs. In an article titled \"Lips Gospel Brunch: Drag for Jesus,\" gospel drag brunch performer Nicolette describes the event as \"cross-dressing for Jesus.\"\n\n"}

It is the third installment in the \"Driver\" series and was developed by Reflections Interactive and published by Atari, Inc.. \"Driver 3\" was released in North America for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on 21 June 2004. In Europe, it was released on 25 June, although due to the way Atari shipped the title across the continent, it made its way into independent UK retailers before the release date, reaching sixth place in the ELSPA chart for that week. A simplified version of the game for mobile phones was developed and released by Sorrent and published in North America on 23 June 2004, while it was published by Unique Games in Europe. On 15 March 2005, it was released on PC for US customers, it was also released on Game Boy Advance 25 October 2005. At one point a Nintendo GameCube version and an N-Gage version were planned, but both were cancelled. The game received mixed reviews on all platforms except the PC, which received mostly unfavorable reviews.\n\nAlthough two \"Driver\" games were published between them, 2011's \"\" is considered the sequel to \"Driver 3\".\n\nThe vehicles in \"Driver 3\" are based on real-life vehicles and are designed to behave as such, using realistic damage modeling (e.g., bullet holes appear when a car is shot, or if the car is hit from behind the trunk of the car will pop out).\n\nWeapons are unnamed in the game, with weapons beyond the player's initial weapon unlocked by completing mission or, in Take A Ride mode, from stealing them from police or other enemies. The players can unlock a variety of weapons, including pistols, rifles, and grenade guns.\n\nNPCs react to the player's actions. For example, pedestrians will flee if they see Tanner with a weapon or if he drives too close to them.\n\nA shootout occurs in Istanbul, Turkey between FBI agent John Tanner, a South Beach cartel agent named Jericho, and the police. Tanner and Jericho shoot each other.\n\nSix months earlier in Miami, Florida, Tanner is tasked by the Miami Police Department to infiltrate a crime syndicate called South Beach, headed by a woman named Calita. He works undercover as a getaway driver in South Beach, catching a man named Baccus and is involved with the apparent death of a man called The Gator.\n\nTanner leaves for Nice, France with South Beach. There he meets two Interpol agents, Henri Vauban and Didier Dubois, who are also working against South Beach. Tanner decides to pursue his case on his own terms. The Interpol agents accidentally spoil Tanner's cover, and he is ambushed by Jericho. Tanner escapes with his partner, Tobias Jones, but Jericho kills Dubois.\n\nIn Istanbul, Turkey, Tanner is now working as a rogue agent due to the incident with Interpol and being subsequently framed for the murder of Dubois. Tanner continues to work against South Beach operations. As he does, he learns Jericho is the real leader of the crime ring. Jericho is involved in a car chase with the Turkish police, and Tanner catches up to Jericho. Jericho is shot by Tanner, but Tanner refuses to execute Jericho; Jericho takes the opportunity to shoot Tanner in the back. Tanner is rushed to the emergency room, where he flatlines. The doctors attempt to resuscitate him.\n\nThe game was in development for around three and a half years. Special attention was paid in rendering the cities of Miami, Nice, and Istanbul. The in-game music was composed by Marc Canham, Rich Aitken, and Narco.\n\nAtari also shot a short promotional video about \"Driver 3\" called \"Run the Gauntlet\".\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version of \"Driver 3\" received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter an extensive and intensive promotional campaign, \"Driver 3\" received \"mixed\" reviews on all platforms except the PC version, which received \"generally unfavorable reviews\", according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\n\"The Times\" gave it all five stars, saying, \"The graphics are divine, with vast urban locales and spectacular crashes. The cars handle well, and each vehicle has its own characteristics. Yet this is no easy driving game — one of the reasons why, subject matter aside, it carries a 16+ rating.\" \"Playboy\" gave it an 88% and stated: \"Your investigation jump-starts reckless car chases through more than 150 miles of highways and city streets in detailed re-creations of Miami, Nice and Istanbul. Slam into any of the 30,000 buildings and your car crumbles realistically.\" However, \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" gave it three stars out of five and called its controls and animation \"unresponsive and stiff\".\n\nWhile \"Driver 3\" received mostly mixed reviews, two outlets operated by Future plc, \"PSM2\" and \"Xbox World\", gave the game 9/10 scores. This disparity led some gamers and journalists to claim that the early access Atari gave Future was contingent on receiving favorable ratings, but Atari and Future denied any wrongdoing. The incident was dubbed \"Driv3rgate\".\n\nAfter the accusations of review fixing arose, the GamesRadar forums (also operated by Future) were filled with critical posts, many of which were deleted by moderators. Although the comments were said to be removed for being libelous, some users suspected a cover-up. Some comments defending \"Driver 3\" and Future were traced by forum moderators to Babel Media, a marketing company that made use of astroturfing. The users admitted they worked for Babel, but said that they were posting on their own behalf, not for Babel. The thread was eventually deleted in its entirety.\n"}

The global membership of the I.B.M. actively supported this dynamic youth-focused program to promote, educate and enhance the activities of young magicians around the world.\n\nMagic Youth International was founded in 1955 by Robert J. Watson and Keith Halbasch, two Chicago teenage magicians. As a correspondence club, teen members shared their magic-related ideas, skills and experiences through personal letters. The letters were compiled into a newsletter called \"PIPS\".\n\nWith college looming in 1959, Robert and Keith released full control of the club to their adult adviser and magic peer Jess James. Under James' management, the club spread to cities across the Midwest United States.\n\nIn 1963, Dale Salwak organized a competing Indiana-based teen magic correspondence club called the Magic Club of America (M.C.A.) Fellow Hoosiers Steve Kelley and Greg Heeter formed a cooperative club called the International Club of Magic (I.C.M.) featuring their teen magic journal \"Top Hat\".\n\nThe three clubs merged in 1966 under Mr. James' Magic Youth International banner retaining the popular \"Top Hat\" as the official club journal.

{"id": "57419079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57419079", "title": "Immersive theater", "text": "Immersive theater\n\nImmersive theater (or interactive theater) differentiates itself from traditional theater by removing the stage and immersing audiences within the performance itself. Often, this is accomplished by using a specific location (\"site-specific\"), allowing audiences to converse with the actors and interact with their surroundings (\"interactive\"), and/or providing agency to the participant to change the narrative (\"choose-your-own-adventure\"). Modern forms of immersive theater have a wide range of definitions, all based upon the degree and type of engagement found between actors and their audience. There has been considerable debate amongst critics concerning these definitions of interaction, at the heart of which are concepts such as audience influence, participation, social constructs and roles, and involvement, all depending on the degree of involvement needed for the works progression. Although many critics argue that all art incorporates a certain level of collaboration between its creator and its viewer, immersive theater differs in that audience members are expected to play some level of an active role in the creative process of the work. Immersive theater can take many forms depending on the degree of involvement of the audience, ranging from open acknowledgment of the audience's presence, to the audience's complete freedom of choice in determining the narrative.\n\nInteractivity in immersive theater is most successful when the appropriate balance of creative freedom of the audience members and narrative structures placed upon them exists.\n\nScholarly analysis of immersive theater is often Eurocentric: three main steps are often identified for creating an immersive and participatory theater experience:\n\n\nOne way immersion and interaction is achieved is through the use of \"polychronic narrative\". This is a narrative in which the participant does not play a main role, as placing them in that position would involve too much volatility and freedom, preventing the telling of a structured story. Instead, the participant is given certain prescribed moments of actions and input. These moments do affect the narrative, but do so in a manner that is more impactful on the participant than any other aspect of the play. Participants are encouraged to be a part of the play, but not a deciding factor. Another way to achieve immersion is by using the word \"you\" when addressing the participant. This allows for the assigned role within the play to mesh with the actual social role of the participant, blurring the lines of reality. It also allows for a certain amount of ambiguity, as specific attributes such as age, gender, and profession are left unaddressed, and open to relative interpretation. The use of suspense and anxiety can be used to guide an individual participant through a narrative. By removing the participant from their comfort zone, their actions and reactions become influenced by both their instincts and the prompts given to them by the actors. This is used to attain believable reactions from a participant, in addition to maintaining order and structure needed to advance a storyline.\n\nImmersive plays use different types of environments, from large multi-leveled buildings to open areas. The different environments enhances the audience's involvement in the play, by giving them choices of how they want to participate in the theater. Inside the different personalized spaces, the audience can move from room to room. In some immersive plays the interiors can be set up on different levels, where each room can be an entirely different scene of the play. Rooms can be dark, bright, colorful, cold, warm, scented, and crammed in order to accomplish an ambiance desired by the actors. By using light colors which correspond to specific emotions, the actors can capture spectators moods before a word is spoken or movement executed. Space is a powerful tool wielded by the actors in order to change audience's point of views.\n\nAccording to many theater theorists, four major components make the audience feel more integrated into theater performances: \"real space,\" sense, movement, and time. \"Real Space\" is a component of immersive theater, and actual space is a part of the staged play. If the play is set in a castle, audiences would go to real castle and have people watch it there in order for them to get feeling of being immersed in the theatrical performance. Engaging the senses, such as blindfolding the audience, can heighten the sense of hearing sound. Movement can effect how audiences perceive plot—moving around the theater space immerses the kinesthetic sense. A sense of time can be engaged by creating a sense of time that precedes and post-dates the play.\n\nThe Teen Interactive Theater Education (TITE) program was established in 2007 to measure the level of decision making skills and adolescent risk behaviors. The TITE program uses performance, role play and peer education to educate youth on making healthier decision. TITE youth participants do several educational performances to deliver information to youth. Teen participants teach other teen about risk prevention through performances. Lessons include the importance of avoiding risky behaviors, improving risk-avoidance skills and knowledge of the consequences of risky behaviors. The objective is to help youth understand risks and the positive effects of decision making skills. Theater provides participating youth with immersive experience focusing on \"team building activities, experimental learning opportunities which will contribute in developing life skills, critical thinking, relationships and values.\" A total of 127 students participated and result found that most students reported an increase in knowledge, abilities and belief due to intervention; some reported less overall learning. Research shows that this program can reduce youth risk behavior to improve overall decision-making skills for youth participants, and improve the way the youth approached decision-making process. Decision-making skills increased for participants. Youth who reported more learning as a result of intervention were more likely to have better outcomes in decision-making than those who reported after they participated in the intervention.\n\nThe National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution created an immersive theater about John Brown that explores historical memory and reflection. An \"Arbiter\", or curator, explains the historical trail of John Brown to visitors. The museum can be a theater where the audience surrounds themselves in the story that involves a historical figure. Theater in museums can help \"engage in public on the profound issues of national importance\" of the complexity of history.\" Museums can use immersive techniques to allow audiences to feel like they are immersing themselves in someone's story, to create empathy towards others. Immersive museum exhibits submerge audiences into the story by not only looking at the exhibit but to also being a part of the exhibit and participating in the exhibit at the museum.\n\nIn 2008 RATS Theatre translated the play \"Antigone\" into an immersive radio drama to teach lessons in democracy and decision making to youths. Rats used computer technology to elicit feedback from the audience to improve future performances. Rats built two different theatres to hold their shows, one in Husby and the other in Kista (Both cities in Sweden). Husby is in a lower income area and Kista is in a higher income area, which helped them reach out to the youths of two completely different communities. This was important because they were able to use their program to help educate youths. All performances took place in an immigrant suburb, and the interactive decision making gave these students an important lesson in democracy—showing them the democratic process of public decision making. In Husby, 84% of the inhabitants are either not born in Sweden or children of immigrant parents. Inputs from teens was optional but encouraged in order to get more information for the future productions. The RATS program has now expanded into Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. With the goal of helping teens getting involved in theatre can have their opinions help shape the future.\n\nThe mixture of interaction and the performance of the story triggers both emotional and cognitive feelings for young audiences. The ability to engage through text messages kept the audience involved while questions provoked deep thought. This cognitive process can improve lives. By the students learning how to use their opinions to shape performances they can also use their opinions to shape society. They can do this by voting in elections, becoming a teacher and most importantly working within the arts. All of these possible options would help continue to shape society in a positive way just as they did when they were motivated by the RATS program.\n\nVirtual reality in immersive theater consists of traditional story and filmic elements: plot, conflict, protagonist, antagonist. Virtual reality is a new way of establishing the protagonist: the user can customize the protagonist in detail to how he or she would like and make the different decisions they think best for the plotline. Virtual reality in immersive storytelling enhances the message the author is trying to convey. VR uses lighting, dialogue, and positioning to immerse players. By being immersed, the player / protagonist undergoes two different types of goals, the external and internal. Virtual technology enhances the immersive theater setting, while staying true to aspects of original theater. The audience will experience the story as if they are a part of the story, following the main character or protagonist on a pathway to achieve their goal. The external goal is whether or not the protagonist physically finds a solution to their conflict while the internal goal is a goal within the protagonist's moral self and emotions.\n\nVirtual reality allows viewers to become fully immersed into a traditional story world, immersing the audience into the storyline. When creating a story through the virtual reality experience, the viewer can change the plot, which usually begins through a traditional inciting incident or catalyst. Through metaphor, characters can illustrate to the audience the plot. Instead of verbally displaying this, it is displayed physically as well from facial expressions and actions. Symbolic objects are important representations used to advance the plot. Irony is displayed through external narrative (wants/desires) and internal narrative (needs). In VR storytelling, there can be many endings: positive ending, where main character gets what they want and need; positive irony is when the main character gets what they need but not what they want\";\" negative irony is when the character gets what they want but not what they need; a negative ending is the conclusion of a main character not getting what they want or need. As the viewer begins the VR story, the plot contains these traditional components: magical opportunity, test, enemy, a missing piece. A magical opportunity allows for the viewer in virtual reality to make choices about using magic in order to help them on their journey. The test challenges the viewer by threatening to take away a part of their identity. The viewer must confront an enemy. The missing piece usually is depicted through a person as an obstacle. This is often correlated to a theme where the main character must realize that \"missing pieces\" are not objects that can be easily obtained. At the end of the story, the main character must renounce their magical abilities or magic.\n\nThe use of digital technology can create an experimental and immersive version of older plays, like the 16th century Chinese play: \"The Peony Pavilion.\" This immersive project, titled \"Inner Awareness: The Dream of Du Linang\", conveys transcendent concepts to the audience using spatial relations dependent on the bodies of audience members by means of digital technology. Digital technology like motion tracking technologies, and computer generated visual effects are used to immerse audiences. The purpose of using such technologies is to immerse the audience in the tactile sequences in the play, utilizing real actors in conjunction with motion tracking and mapping to generate a holographic effect, performing alongside the actors. This digital immersion seeks to recreate a classical Chinese garden as a space for the audience to walk around and experience the play. The spatial relations of the garden allow the audience to fill the void with subjective personal experiences and memory, creating a unique experience for each audience member. The recreation of the garden is digital, using real photographs of an actual garden serving as the basis and overlaying them with computer generated effects. The digital immersive garden is a way to tell the story using the concept of space, which is intended to immerse the audience in the illusory nature of the play. In addition, the figure of each audience member will be traced and projected, creating personal interaction. The audience is encouraged to create movement for their digital bodies, which further immerses the audiencethey become part of the play.\n\nIn 1992 a local Brazilian theatre practitioner named Augusto Boal announced that he was running for the role of commissioner (mayor) and won the election using the slogan \"Have the courage to be happy.\" Augusto employed five full-time actors and ten part-time actors to aid in his \"street theatre style, which was based on the idea of providing interactive theatrical performances to the impoverished parts of Rio in an effort to convey political policies through the art of acting on a interpersonal level and to boost morale within poor neighborhoods through media that is very often unattainable to the general working class. \"We use theatre to discuss problems of communities, workers, Blacks, women, street children, the unemployed, the homeless, etc. We don't want a passive audience, simply watching. We propose, on the contrary , that the public participate, interfere, enter on to the stage and propose alternatives for the plot: create a new story…Theatre is political and politics is theatre.\" Boal's stated goal was to use theater to change the political world, not to have the political world make him change. His idea of \"legislative theatre\" changed Brazilian political style, and would later become a style of art used internationally to advocate for social organizations.\n\nTheatrical areas that are off-limits can add incentive for some audiences to explore. But, set designers often fail to plan for the possibilities and dangers of audiences going off-script to explore during performances. Audiences that participate in immersive theater are prohibited from entering restricted areas but the desire to go in a restricted area is not the failure of the audience's engagement, but an enhancement to the overall experience for immersive theater. Interacting with restricted areas can add a new perspective to immersive theatre. One example of restricted space is a performance conducted in various rooms at the Somerset House and King's College London. Audience members encountered a sign during the performance labeled, \"DO NOT ENTER.\" It was clear that the performance prohibited any audience members from entering the room as it was not a part of the performance. Curious of what was beyond the restricted area, some entered the restricted area and wandered beyond the set play. The notion of audiences entering restricted areas contributes to interactive immersion because areas off limits contain a sense of mystery and wonder that set designers fail to plan; this impulse to explore arguably led to the birth of interactive and immersive theater. Restricted areas add a layer to the overall experience of an immersive theatre, but can also be dangerous and safety must be considered paramount. Some immersive theater designers incorporate audiences going safely off script into their work. \"Adventure 1,\" conducted by Coney, a British interactive and game-based theater, consists of audiences who record their adventure at St. Paul near the center of London. Participants are in an open and unrestricted set while wearing headphones that plays a fixed narrative. From there, audiences can travel anywhere. Although the members of the theatre listen to direction, they can encounter various experiences beyond the script or role. This contributes to more experiences that set designers fail to plan in the original experience.\n"}

{"id": "37012331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37012331", "title": "List of Vetala Tales", "text": "List of Vetala Tales\n\nVetala Tales\nis a popular collection of stories from India of unknown antiquity, but predating the 11th century CE. It exists in four main Sanskrit recensions, and many modern translations into Indian and other vernaculars. The collection consists of a series of unrelated tales, all told within the context of a frame story. The exact content of the frame stories varies between versions, but always involves the core element of King Vikramaditya carrying a dead body to a yogi in a cemetery; the body is possessed by a Vetala, who tells Vikramaditya the tales to pass the time, and aids him in thwarting the yogi's nefarious scheme in the conclusion. Unlike the \"Panchatantra\", whose recensions and translations sometimes vary greatly (see List of \"Panchatantra\" Stories for a tabulated comparison), the overall content and structure of the \"Vetala Tales\" has remained relatively stable (though exhibiting many minor differences). \n\n\"For additional bibliographic information, see Baital Pachisi.\"\n\n\nThe table below compares the content and order of tales in these versions. The frame story is never numbered, but sometimes the conclusion of the frame story is numbered, sometimes not; where it is \"not\" it is indicated with a decimal (e.g. \"25.2\") in the table.\n\nThe elements of the frame story vary significantly between versions, and the logical or narrative connections between them are not always made clear.\n\nKing Gandharvasena (father of Vikramaditya) dies. His 1st son, Shank, succeeds, but is killed by the 2nd son, Vikramaditya, who succeeds to the throne. However, Vikramaditya goes abroad, consigning the throne to the 3rd son, Bharthari. Then follows the episode of the Fruit of Immortality: the fruit gets passed around, its trail revealing conflicting loyalties; because of this, Bharthari becomes despondent and vacates the throne. Indra sends a demon to guard the city, but Vikramaditya returns to regain the throne and subdues the demon. The demon narrates the story of \"Three sons\" (below) to Vikramaditya.\n\nThis narrative does not occur in any of the Sanskrit recensions. It begins Lāl's Hindi translation, and has a close analogue in the \"Thirty-Two Tales of the Throne of Vikramaditya\" (\"Simhāsana Dvātriṃśikā\"). Burton includes it in his introduction.\n\nA) A king comes across an ascetic absorbed in supernatural meditation. Out of pique the king decides to disturb the ascetic, and sends a harlot to seduce him. She succeeds and eventually brings the ascetic and his son to the city, at which point the ascetic realizes he has been tricked out of his merit. In anger he kills his child.\n\nB) This leads (it is not explained how) to the birth of 3 children in the same city at the same time with linked destinies: the sons of a king, a potter, and an oil merchant. The potter's son kills the oil merchant's son.\n\nThis narrative occurs in Sivadasa and Lāl. Only in Lāl is it made clear that the king's son is Vikramaditya, the potter's son is the yogi (of the subsequent section), and the oil merchant's son is the body inhabited by the Vetala. In his conclusion, Jambhaladatta has the Vetala narrate his own previous history which is somewhat related to part B, but with a very different overall story. Burton has Indra's giant tell part B, then part A which occurs subsequently (the ascetic here being the yogi himself).\n\nEvery day, a yogi (Kṣāntiśīla in many versions) brings a fruit to Vikramaditya which he passes off to an attendant or minister. One day the fruit is accidentally broken open in the king's presence, revealing a priceless jewel. Investigation reveals that all the fruits likewise contained jewels. Vikramaditya questions the yogi who states that he intends to perform rites in a cremation-ground and asks the king to join him on a certain night. Vikramaditya agrees. When he does so, the yogi asks him to bring him a certain dead body hanging from a tree in another nearby cremation-ground. The body turns out to be inhabited by a vetala, who decides to pass the time on the way back to the yogi by telling tales. \n\nThis narrative occurs in all 4 Sanskrit recensions, as well as most other versions.\n\nAfter the Vetala is done telling his tales, he helps Vikramaditya by predicting the yogi's treachery, and explaining a ruse by which he can avoid it. Vikramaditya finally succeeds in bringing the body to the yogi, and just before the end of the rite, tricks and kills the yogi. Vikramaditya then generally receives great power and specific boons (including that this very story achieve great renown).\n\nThis narrative occurs in all 4 Sanskrit recensions, as well as most other versions. The power and boons are attributed to different sources in different versions, e.g. a result of the rite itself (Sivadasa), gandharvas (Sivadasa), Indra (Lāl), Shiva (Somadeva), a goddess (Jambhaladatta).\n\nAn abbreviated version of \"Yogi and Vetala\" and the Conclusion is given as the 31st of the \"Thirty-Two Tales of the Throne of Vikramaditya\" (\"Simhāsana Dvātriṃśikā\").\n\nThe beginning of the Tamil version mirrors the frame story of the Katha-sarit-sagara, in that the Vetala is actually a Brahmin, cursed for repeating Shiva's tale — the \"Vetala Tales\" in fact — which the Vetala must now repeat until someone (Vikrama) can solve their riddles.\n\nTibetan and Mongolian versions also exist in which not only the frame story, but also the component tales, are quite different.\n\n"}

Turkington has released a number of albums as Hamburger and has appeared as the character in various films, television shows, and other media. In 2015, the act inspired the Rick Alverson film \"Entertainment\", which stars Turkington as a \"variant\" of the Neil Hamburger character.\n\nTurkington developed the character in the 1990s and originally envisioned the concept as a \"weird recording project\". It originated from a prank call that appeared on the album \"Great Phone Calls Featuring Neil Hamburger\" (1992). He followed the LP with three more albums issued on Drag City Records before he began receiving offers to perform as the character for live shows. His albums \"Neil Hamburger Sings Country Winners\" (2009) and \"First of Dismay\" (2014) feature original songs and cover versions backed by \"The Too Good For Neil Hamburger Band\".\n\nHamburger's live act, which is quite different from his many albums, features a barrage of question/answer jokes aimed often at celebrity targets as well as barbs aimed at his ex-wife. The confrontational aspects of his act drew comparisons to Tony Clifton. One of his most famous gags is the \"Zipper Lips\", in which he asks an audience member a question. If the audience member doesn't respond, Hamburger derides them for being a \"zipper lips\". A common phrase used by the comedian is \"But that's my life!\", which he uses when he mentions being humiliated or degraded for some reason.\n\nHis first full-length album, \"America's Funnyman\", was released in 1996 on the Drag City. Several more were issued on the record label. \n\nHamburger was a frequent guest on the Internet talk show \"Tom Green's House Tonight\" (2006–2013). In 2006, Hamburger started doing his own show called \"Poolside Chats with Neil Hamburger\" on \"The Channel\" at Tomgreen.com. Guests on his show have included Tim and Eric, Kyle Gass of Tenacious D, Buzz Osborne of The Melvins, and Bonnie 'Prince' Billy.\n\nIn 2006, Hamburger had a brief cameo appearance in the film \"Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny\". Over the next year, he opened for Tenacious D during their Pick of Destiny Tour. However, his performances incited mostly negative reactions, with booing and heckling ensuing in countries such as Ireland and England. His performance at Madison Square Garden was referred to by Sia Michel of \"The New York Times\" as likely \"the greatest night of his career.\"\n\nIn 2008, Drag City released an album of country and western originals and covers recorded by Hamburger in a \"celebrity vocals\" style. During the sessions, Hamburger was backed by musicians including Prairie Prince of The Tubes and Todd Rundgren's band, David Gleason, Atom Ellis of Dieselhed and the New Cars, Rachel Haden from That Dog.\n\nIn December 2010, Special Entertainment released an iPhone App called \"Shaky Advice from Neil Hamburger\" that functions much like a Magic 8 Ball, with 30 video clips of Hamburger giving comical advice.\n\nIn 2015, the Neil Hamburger act was dramatized for the Rick Alverson film \"Entertainment\". In it, the character is shown repeatedly on and offstage; as well as the life of a fictional portrayal of the man behind the act separate from the real Gregg Turkington. The film's script was written by Turkington, Alverson, and comedian Tim Heidecker, although the dialogue was improvised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The absence of pirate radio in Australia is primarily attributed to the relatively large number of commercial licences that were issued, particularly after World War 2, as well as the existence of public (later renamed community) non-commercial broadcasting licenses supported mainly by listener subscription. Additionally, the lack of availability of imported broadcasting equipment and the likely application of severe, legislated penalties including jail for offenders, would also have been a factor.\n\nAmateur radio operators must obtain a $250 low-power open narrowcasting license from the Australian Communications and Media Authority to legally operate on a specific frequency.\n\nA small number of the total pirate radio stations in Australia are documented.\n\n"}

{"id": "2412931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2412931", "title": "Programme (booklet)", "text": "Programme (booklet)\n\nA programme or program (see spelling differences) is a booklet available for patrons attending a live event such as theatre performances, fêtes, sports events, etc. It is a printed leaflet outlining the parts of the event scheduled to take place, principal performers and background information. In the case of theatrical performances, the term playbill is also used. It may be provided free of charge by the event organisers or a charge may be levied.\n\nAt a theatre, opera, or ballet performance, they are usually given at the door in the United States, while they are usually sold in the United Kingdom. The Broadway programme makes its money from selling advertisements. A programme company pays the theatre for the rights to produce the production’s programmes, which is contrary to common belief that the theatre pays the programme company. The programme generally contains photos of the production, a cast list, biographies of the actors and production staff involved, the name of the theatre, background information, and can contain advertisements. For example, the programme for the original production of \"Man of La Mancha\" contained articles by the staff about how the production was created. The first theatre programmes were issued in the mid-nineteenth century in magazine format. The original theatre programme first appeared in the 18th century. The early playbills were basic, with only enough pages to list the cast members and information on the play's locale and scenes. There were usually only four pages: the cover advertised the show, a back page displayed the theatre layout, and the two interior pages listed all the credits. Not all early programmes were printed, but written by hand or cut and pasted together from the letters of other printed documents. The latter was especially done by theatre entrepreneur Sarah Baker, who owned several theatres in Kent, during the late 18th century.\n\nIn early British theatre, the cast was very important. Audiences were very familiar with leading actors and a particular player could draw a larger crowd. The programme was a kind of contract between the theatre and the audience, because if an audience paid to see a particular actor and they were not presented, there was the immediate risk of crowd hissing, orange throwing, or even rioting. This sometimes resulted in property damage and physical assault.\n\nProgrammes were not only distributed in theatres, but also on the streets. The distributors were often women who worked for the theatre by selling oranges as refreshments to audiences. It has been alluded to that these women were also prostitutes. However, there was still a large rate of illiteracy among theatre goers. This resulted in companies of actors traversing urban streets with a beating drum while announcing upcoming venues.\nBy the 19th century, the programmes, similar to today's, were being printed. However, the earlier playbills of the 18th century still contained more designs and information about a production. By 1884, advertisements had become a standard feature in playbills. Beginning in New York City, the first company to specialize in printing theatrical programmes was founded by an Ohio business man, Frank Vance Strauss. By 1911, the company was called the \"Strauss Magazine Theatre Program\". On September 23, 1920, the company, then known as the \"New York Theatre Program Corporation\", advertised its sales at a million and a half per month. This corporation was the early foundation for the modern day magazine, Playbill.\n\nDuring World War II, British theatre programmes underwent a dramatic change as the government placed restrictions over paper use. The programme turned back into a single sheet of paper folded over once to efficiently create four available pages for text. Not until the 1970s were photo printed programmes available and widely distributed at British theatres. The American Playbill did not suffer as severely during the second World War and was still published at a regular rate.\n\nTheatre programmes have become very valuable articles of information for a city or nation's cultural history. An example is Australia's celebration in 2008 over the returning of its earliest surviving document from Canada, which was a theatre playbill from 1796. The playbill advertised the production of \"The Tragedy of Jane Shore\". George Hughes, a convict aboard the First Fleet, printed the playbill using Australia’s first printing press.\n\nIn September 2017, the British Library opened its \"In the Spotlight\" project, showcasing a portion of its significant collection of playbills dating from the 1730s to the 1950s. Some of the library's collection of approximately 234,000 playbills, bound into over 1000 volumes, were digitised and made accessible online. The public were asked, via the project website, to help \"bring them back into the spotlight\".\n\nAt professional sporting events, programmes are often sold, and contain information about the teams competing. In the United Kingdom, football programmes are issued by the home team for every home match and, as a hobby, are collected by supporters and football enthusiasts. Sports programmes can be highly collectible, with some rare football programmes commanding high prices: in the UK, potentially into the thousands of pounds. Oftentimes in European sports, independent companies will publish their own programmes and sell them outside a venue. These are known as fanzines. Although it is less common in the United States, outside of Fenway Park, this is a common occurrence as \"Yawkey Way Report\" is sold as well as another booklet.\n\nIn the case of films, programmes are rarely provided, although they were frequently given out during the original roadshow engagements of spectaculars such as \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), \"King of Kings\" (1961), or \"How the West Was Won\" (1962), as well as \"specialized\" films like Disney's \"Fantasia\" or the three Laurence Olivier Shakespeare films that he starred in and directed: \"Henry V\", \"Hamlet\", and \"Richard III\". They served much the same function as those for live theater. Programmes for films made in special widescreen processes also explained how the widescreen effect was accomplished.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42375202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42375202", "title": "Riot (video game)", "text": "Riot (video game)\n\nRiot is a 2017 indie video game about a riot simulator based on real events. The project started with an Indiegogo campaign in February 2014, which ended in a success. The developers went silent until 2014, whereupon the goal of the \"second half of 2014\" was predicted. The game was released on December 6, 2017 for Steam's early access. The director of the game and previously an editor and cinematographer at Valve, Leonard Menchiari, has experienced riots personally and the game \"Riot\" was created as a way to express it and to tell the stories of these events. The player can pick between playing as police or rioters. The game will potentially be released on Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. The producers are interested in bringing the game to these platforms, but are currently restricted by their budget.\n\nRIOT allows the player to play as both the police and rioting groups. As the police, the game revolves around strategy and planning, with a GUI that adopts a traditional police style. This contrasts the typical gameplay of the rioting group, which is adaptive and responsive, relying on the decisions the police make as opposed to long-term planning, instead relying on fast decision making skills. The game includes six main campaigns set in Italy, Greece, Spain and Egypt.\n\nOther riots set across the world will be available as well as an unlockable. Each scenario will have different backgrounds as well as props and police uniforms. activists’ clothing will be procedurally generated. Characters will have different stats that change the way they react in different situations, This means people will act in unpredictable ways based on the elements that will happen in each riot. RIOT is planning to release an in-game level editor, using this players will be able to re-create the riots that are currently going on in the world. The levels can then be shared with anyone in the world, and can then be rated by others based on quality and historical accuracy.\n\nThe scenarios in \"Riot\" were partly informed through designer Leonard Menchiari's participation in the Italian No TAV protests. \"Riot\" was part funded through an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, raising $36,139 in March 2013. Some of the game's budget was for travel and research. Designer Mattia Traverso, who joined Menchiari at the time of the Indiegogo campaign said, \"Physically visiting these places and joining the live riots is fundamental\", \"how could we even claim to describe such an important topic without having lived it multiple times or having talked with the rioters or the police?\" The game aims to depict scenarios in a neutral manner, allowing the player to explore both sides of the conflict.\n\n\"Riot\" emulates a 2D retro look even though the scene is 3D, which gives more realistic lighting, physics, and visual effects. All character movements are physics based. This means that rather than following just a path, the crowd movement will be influenced by the physical contact given by the rest of the crowd. The art style is inspired by \"\".\n\n"}

The two-week festival starts on the Friday of the first week in November and covers downtown Seoul in sparkling lights, illuminating the city at night during the early winter. Visitors can encounter various types of lanterns from Cheonggye Plaza to Supyo Bridge (1.2 kilometers).\n\nSeoul Lantern Festival offers different concepts of festival every year.\n\nThe first Seoul Lantern Festival celebrated the 'Visit Korea Year 2010 to 2012' for 5 days. The festival had four themes that were related to 'ryu' Korean. \n\nThe second Seoul Lantern Festival drew 2.3 million visitors, including about 370,000 foreign tourists. The festival's paper lanterns were from 24 countries including Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand and Malaysia. The festival was originally planned for 10 days, but public pressure, largely from the foreign tourists, convinced the organisers to extend the festival by seven additional days. \n\nThe main theme of the 2011 festival was 'The History of Seoul by Lanterns' (alternately, '…Told with Light'; literally 'An Old Story of Seoul with Lantern'). Lantern art was used to tell the history of Korea from the Joseon Dynasty through modern times, with special attention to the stories told for Children.\n\n'The Roots of Seoul, the Life of Ancestors'. was the theme for 2012, once again running a total of 17 days with lanterns illuminated from 5:00 PM to 11:00 PM. Highlighting the design, colour and exotic atmosphere created by lanterns, the overall display extended to over and included over 35,000 lights from around Korea (including Suncheon, Namwon, Uiryeong, Inje, Yeongju and Yeongwol, among others) as well as Japan, the Philippines and Singapore. \n\nThis fifth Seoul Lantern Festival opened on 1 November to 11 November with a main theme of 'Millennial dream of Hanseong Baekje'. During this festival, visitors could make hanji lanterns, watch musical performances and enjoy other entertainments and events along Cheonggye Plaza and other Seoul sites. A modern lantern in the form of a falcon symbolized the lionhearted Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, and an opening musical performance and parade was based on the life of Geunchogo of Baekje who oversaw the apex of that kingdom.\n\n\nThe Seoul Lantern Festival changed its Korean name in 2014 to the Seoul Bitcholong Festival, but there was no change to the name in English. According to the organizing committee, it has changed the Korean name because the festival has expanded to be a combination of traditional lanterns and modern lights like LEDs. It has opened from Cheonggye Plaza to Supyogyo(Bridge) about 1.2 km and displayed about 30,000 light bulbs and about 300 lanterns of 58 lantern light arts. Moreover, the wish tree that is displayed at Kwangtong Bridge was 8 m high and it contained the wishes of Seoul citizens and foreign visitors. As a result, about 3.14 million visitors enjoyed the Seoul Lantern Festival 2014. The total visitors rate has increased 25% from the year before. The largest number of visitors enjoyed the Seoul Lantern Festival 2014.\n\nTotal foreign visitors are about 630,000 and this rate has increased 16% from the year before.\n\n\n\nThe Seoul Lantern Festival was organized just in time to celebrate the 'Visit Korea Year 2010 to 2012'. It was decided to hold the Seoul Lantern Festival annually, and in response the city of Jinju criticized the festival severely. They said that the Seoul Lantern Festival was a copy of their Jinju Namgang Yudeng Festival, which itself is annual and had begun earlier, in 2000. It had been started in that year as a public requiem, and also as an occasion for a Korean prayer rite in honour of about 70,000 soldiers and civilians who had died in the historic second battle at Jinju Castle in 1593. More than 20 Jinju associations asked for the Seoul Lantern Festival to be discontinued. There was a one-man protest in front of the Seoul city hall and an assembly at the Seoul station. As a result, the city of Seoul and the city of Jinju agreed to change the Korean name of the Seoul Lantern Festival, and thus differentiated the Seoul Lantern Festival from the Jinju Namgang Yudeng Festival.\n\n"}

He was also a prolific singer-songwriter who could play as many as 100 musical instruments, some simultaneously. His career, beginning in 1934, spanned four decades, including a regular role on CBS-TV's \"Petticoat Junction\" in the 1960s.\n\nLester A. Burnett (he added the final \"e\" later in life) was born in Summum, Illinois, on March 18, 1911, and grew up in Ravenwood, Missouri. He began singing as a child and learned to play a wide variety of instruments by ear, yet never learned to read or write music. In his teens, he worked in vaudeville, and starting in 1929, at the state's first commercial radio station, WDZ-AM in Tuscola, Illinois.\n\nBurnette came by his nickname while creating a character for a WDZ children's program. He was reading Mark Twain's \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\" at the time, which included a character named Jim Smiley. He named the radio character Mr. Smiley and soon adopted the moniker as his own, dropping the title.\n\nHis break came in December 1933, when he was hired by Gene Autry to play accordion on \"National Barn Dance\" on Chicago's WLS-AM, on which Autry was the major star. As sound films became popular, Hollywood sought musical talent for Western films; and in 1934, producer Nat Levine cast Autry and Burnette in their film debut (unbilled) as part of a bluegrass band in Mascot Pictures' \"In Old Santa Fe\" starring Ken Maynard. Burnette sang and played accordion, and the film included two of his compositions.\n\nHe had other small parts until a secondary, but more prominent role in the 1935 serial \"The Adventures of Rex and Rinty\". That same year, Levine gave Autry his first starring role in the 12-part serial \"The Phantom Empire\", with Burnette playing Oscar, a comic-relief role. Mascot was soon absorbed by Republic Pictures, and Republic enjoyed enormous success with its musical Western features starring Autry. In each of the films, Burnette played Autry's comic sidekick, Frog Millhouse, with his trademark floppy black hat and trick voice (imitating a deep, froglike croak). Their association produced 62 feature-length musical Westerns.\n\nBy 1940, Smiley Burnette ranked second only to Autry in a \"Boxoffice\" magazine popularity poll of Western stars, the lone sidekick among the top 10 (though offscreen he earned a reputation as being moody and temperamental), and when Autry left for World War II service, Burnette provided a sidekick to Eddie Dew, Sunset Carson, and Bob Livingston and appeared in nine other films with Roy Rogers. Burnette's movie horse, white with a black-ringed left eye, also became famous, first as Black-eyed Nellie, then as Ring-eyed Nellie, and finally as just Ring Eye.\n\nAfter leaving Republic in June 1944, he became the sidekick to Charles Starrett at Columbia Pictures in the new \"Durango Kid\" series. Starrett and Burnette were paired in 56 films, from 1945 to 1952. When Starrett retired, Burnette was still under contract, so Columbia teamed him with Jock Mahoney for a new series of Westerns. A pilot film with Mahoney and Burnette was completed, but never released; Columbia then reassigned Burnette to its Gene Autry series, reuniting Burnette with his former partner.\n\nSmiley Burnette wrote more than 400 songs and sang a significant number of them on screen. His Western classic, \"Ridin' Down the Canyon (To Watch the Sun Go Down)\", was later recorded by Willie Nelson, Riders in the Sky, and Johnnie Lee Wills. Other compositions included \"On the Strings of My Lonesome Guitar\" (Jimmy Wakely's theme song in the 1940s), \"Fetch Me Down My Trusty .45\", \"Ridin' All Day\", and \"It's Indian Summer\" as well as \"The Wind Sings a Cowboy Song,\" \"The Old Covered Wagon,\" and \"Western Lullaby.\" He also composed musical scores for such films as \"The Painted Stallion\" and \"Waterfront Lady\". His songs were recorded by a wide range of singers, including Bing Crosby, Ferlin Husky, and Leon Russell. His performance of \"Steamboat Bill\" appeared on \"Billboard's\" country chart in 1939.\n\nBurnette devised and built some of his unusual musical instruments in his home workshop. His \"Jassackaphone\", for example, which he played in the film \"The Singing Cowboy\", resembled an organ with pipes, levers, and pull mechanisms.\n\nIn the 1940s, he invented and patented an early home audiovisual system called Cinevision Talkies. Each package contained a 78 rpm record with four of his songs and 15 35 mm slides. The slides were to be projected in order and advanced each time a short tone played on the record during the songs. An inside cover of the record album was white so those with no projector and screen could simply shine a flashlight through the slides and view them on the cover. He also devised more than a dozen clever uses for a common wire clothes hanger and demonstrated several of them during a TV show guest appearance.\n\nHollywood stars usually left their publicity and promotion to the studios that employed them, but Smiley Burnette took charge of his promotion personally. He was highly aware of his box-office value and shrewdly merchandised his name and likeness. He organized a national Smiley Burnette Fan Club, aimed mostly at the juvenile audience, and sold autographed photos and souvenirs to club members. He made additional money by making personal appearances at theaters showing his films. Burnette's base of operations was Springfield, Missouri, where he produced and hosted a nationally syndicated 15-minute radio program, \"The Smiley Burnette Show\", through RadiOzark Enterprises. He also made regular appearances on ABC-TV's \"Ozark Jubilee\" from Springfield. \n\nIn early 1957, when quiz shows were popular, he filmed a pilot for a proposed ABC-TV series to originate from Springfield called \"Pig 'N Poke,\" a quiz show with a country theme, although ABC did not buy the show.\n\nBurnette enjoyed cooking, and in the 1950s, he opened a restaurant chain called The Checkered Shirt, the first of the A-frame drive-ins. The first location was in Orlando, Florida, and two locations still exist in California (Redding and Escondido), though they are no longer owned by the Burnette family.\n\nAs the 1960s began, Burnette continued to make personal appearances at drive-ins, fairs, hospitals, town squares, and rodeos. Among other venues, he once appeared with Dewey Brown and the Oklahoma Playboys at a Friday-night dance at Jump's Roller Rink in Fairfax, Oklahoma.\n\nIn the mid 1960s, he portrayed railway engineer Charley Pratt on the CBS-TV programs \"Petticoat Junction\" (106 episodes) and \"Green Acres\" (seven episodes).\n\nJust after filming wrapped for the fourth season of \"Petticoat Junction\", Burnette became ill. On February 16, 1967, a month before his 56th birthday, he died in Encino, California, from leukemia and was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California.\n\nBurnette donated his original hat and shirt to the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1962. In 1971, he was inducted posthumously into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Burnette was inducted posthumously into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1986 with a motion pictures star located at 6125 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1998, he was inducted into the Western Music Association. On May 5, 2012 he was inducted into the Cowtown Society of Western Music Hall of Fame as a Hero.\n\nBurnette is mentioned in the Statler Brothers' 1973 country music hit \"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?\" (later the title of a 1994 Scott biography), which reached number 22 on the country chart.\n\n\n"}

The degree of structural pluralism is used to examine how societies are structured, and specifically is a way to explain coverage differences in media markets. Structural pluralism is studied in philosophical, sociological and communication literature.\n\nStructural pluralism is what makes civic community a unique form of civil society (Morton, 2000). Structural pluralism represents the extent to which the community has an open and inclusive structure that permits minority voices and opinions to be heard when citizens and citizen groups are addressing community problems (Young, 1999).\n\nCommunities are discussed in terms of having common institutions, such as governing or other political bodies, religious, educational and economic institutions. These bodies or institutions help to maintain the social order within the community.\n\nThis concept comes from the field of sociology, but prior to that, stems from writings by Hegel (1821) on civic society. This comes also from the functionalist writings of Émile Durkheim and Herbert Spencer (Hindman, 1999).\n\nDurkheim writes that there are two organizating principle types of societies, that most like the premodern communities, called mechanical solidarity in which ethnic and extended families were central; and that called organic solidarity which examines the relationships of interdependence based on other components, such as work, and social organizations (Durkheim, 1933). These are equated to today's rural and urban societies respectively.\n\nOlien, Donohue and Tichenor (1978; Tichenor, Olien, & Donohue, 1980) helped to fold this concept into the communication discipline when they noted that structural pluralism has an effect on the way in which news is presented. Through several studies and publications, they built a model of structural pluralism, and later showed how power relationships work through a systems approach (Donohue, Olien, & Tichenor, 1985; Tichenor, Olien, & Donohue, 1980).\n\nAs media are typically supportive of the social system and institutions, as well as dependent upon them for gaining access to and gathering material that will be useful to the public, they often reflect the power structure of the community. Movements, groups or discussions that are critical of the social structure are often excluded from newspapers in communities where there is a strongly centralized power structure. An example of such a community would be a town in which a significant portion of adults are employed by one business or industry. Criticism of this business or industry may erode the faith of community members in it and lead to social unrest.\n\nInitially the work of the Olien, Tichenor and Donohue camp allowed us to see how diversity in communities is reflected in the reporting style of news organizations. Conflict within communities is more often reported in larger and less homogeneous areas.\n\nHowever, prior to the Olien, Tichenor, Donohue writings came those of Breed (1958) and Paletz, Reichert and McIntyre (1971). In their original pieces, the lack of criticism by the press on central powerholders was discussed.\n\nOther studies of the impact of structural pluralism on journalism have looked shown that women are more often represented in areas that are more ethnically diverse (Armstrong, 2002); that newspapers in more diverse communities will be less likely to ignore protest stories or report them in an abbreviated fashion (Stein, et al., 2003); and others.\n\nStructural pluralism has been discussed in law journals as a paradigmatic shift regarding the privatization of government entities (Roberts, 2001).\n\n\n"}

In ancient Greek drama, the tritagonist was the third member of the acting troupe.\n\nAs a character, a tritagonist may act as the instigator or cause of the sufferings of the protagonist. Despite being the least sympathetic character of the drama, he or she occasions the situations by which pity and sympathy for the protagonist are excited.\n\nThe part of the tritagonist emerged from earlier forms of two-actor drama. Where two actors only allowed for a principal character and their adversary, moving the part of adversary to a third actor (the tritagonist) allowed for the second actor (the deuteragonist) to play roles as a confidant or aide to the principal character, and thereby elicit greater character depth from the principal character by having the protagonist explain their feelings and motivations to an on-stage listener. As Ancient Greek theater recitations were partly melodic, the role of the tritagonist would typically go to a performer with a voice in the bass range (as compared to the protagonist as tenor and the deuteragonist as baritone). Cicero, in his \"Divinatio in Caecilium\", reported that the tritagonist (being a role of lesser importance than the protagonist) would often have to subdue his voice if he was naturally stronger than the protagonist.\n\nNotable Ancient Greek actors who worked in this role include the orator Aeschines, who was held by Demosthenes to have been untalented as a tritagonist, and Myniscus, who was tritagonist under the playwright Aeschylus.\n\nIn some forms of Greek theater, it was traditional for the tritagonist to enter the stage from the left.\n"}
{"id": "5218457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5218457", "title": "Writing style", "text": "Writing style\n\nIn literature, writing style is the manner of expressing thought in language characteristic of an individual, period, school, or nation. Thus, style is a term that may refer, at one and the same time, to both conventions that go beyond the individual writer and to singular aspects of individual writing. Beyond the essential elements of spelling, grammar, and punctuation, writing style is the choice of words, sentence structure, and paragraph structure, used to convey the meaning effectively. The former are referred to as \"rules\", \"elements\", \"essentials\", \"mechanics\", or \"handbook\"; the latter are referred to as \"style\", or \"rhetoric\". The rules are about \"what\" a writer does; style is about \"how\" the writer does it. While following the rules drawn from established English usage, a writer has great flexibility in how to express a concept. The point of good writing style is to\nnot to\nalthough these are usually evident and are what experts consider the writer’s individual style.\n\nDiction, or the choice of \"words\", is obviously a central element in every writer’s style. Although good diction is partly a matter of trial and error, of tinkering with sentences until they sound right, it is also a matter of following certain general preferences that careful readers and writers tend to share.\n\nSome methods for using diction effectively in writing:\n\nSooner or later, a writer will have the essential elements of formal \"sentence\" correctness under control and will want to find the best ways of making sentences convey meaning effectively: how to phrase statements definitely, place coordinate thoughts in coordinate structures, subordinate to sharpen the relation between main assertions and modifying elements, eliminate unnecessary words, vary sentence structure, maintain consistency of tone, and smooth the general flow of words. Seemingly minor improvements—the moving of a clause from one position to another, a shift from the passive to the active voice, even a slight change in rhythm—can make the difference between drab sentences and pointed ones.\n\nSome methods for writing effective sentences:\n\nThe most important unit of meaning in every literary work is the \"paragraph\". Although each sentence conveys a thought, a literary work is not just a sequence of, say, eighty thoughts; it is rather a development of one central thesis through certain steps. Those steps are paragraphs. Within an effective paragraph the sentences support and extend one another in various ways, making a single, usually complex, unfolding idea.\n\nApart from outright incoherence, choppiness, or long-windedness, perhaps the most common flaw in paragraph construction is rigidity of presentation. Having something to say, the writer merely says it—and goes on to do just the same in the following paragraph. As a result, the reader feels, not like a participant in the writer’s thought, but like someone receiving instructions or being shown a rapid succession of images.\n\nSome methods for writing effective paragraphs:\n\nNote how rewriting the familiar sentence, \"These are the times that try men’s souls.\" by Thomas Paine, changes the overall impact of the message.\n\nCompare the following passages, and note how the authors convey their messages in different manners, as a result of their choices.\n\n\"Hamlet\", Act II, Scene 2 (1599–1602) by William Shakespeare:\n\n\"A Tale of Two Cities\" (1859) by Charles Dickens:\n\n\"Memories of Christmas\" (1945) by Dylan Thomas:\n\n\"The Strawberry Window\" (1955) by Ray Bradbury:\n\n\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" (1963) by Martin Luther King, Jr.:\n\nThe writer's voice is a rather vague metaphorical term by which some critics refer to distinctive features of a written work in terms of spoken utterance. The voice of a literary work is then the specific group of characteristics displayed by the narrator or poetic \"speaker\" (or, in some uses, the actual author behind them), assessed in terms of \"tone\", \"style\", or \"personality\". Distinctions between various kinds of narrative voice tend to be distinctions between kinds of \"narrator\" in terms of how they address the reader (rather than in terms of their perception of events, as in the distinct concept of \"point of view\"). Likewise in non-narrative poems, distinctions can be made between the personal voice of a private lyric and the assumed voice (the persona) of a dramatic monologue.\n\nAn author uses sentence patterns not only to make a point or tell a story, but to do it in a certain manner that amounts to a personal signature, a characteristic way of presenting reality. It is perfectly understandable that an aspiring writer could fall in love with the work of a brilliant literary figure (for example, William Faulkner or William S. Burroughs) and then try to emulate that literary voice, but when an amateur aims deliberately for the sort of mature voice found in seasoned professionals, the result is likely to be literarily pretentious and largely unreadable. In fact, this sort of literary pretentiousness is a clear mark of an amateur. A strong, distinctive, authoritative writing voice is something most fiction writers want and is something any writer can bring out in himself or herself, but oddly enough, it can’t be produced by concentrating on it, nor can it be imparted by an editor or teacher. Such an effect is achieved simply by writing often and carefully. Spending creative energy in the service of the way sentences read as prose is likely to be at the expense of the characters or story. Writers should concentrate on characters and story and let their voice take care of itself.\n\nWriting coaches, teachers, and authors of creative writing books often speak of the writer's voice as distinguished from other literary elements. However, as voice is often described vaguely, their distinction may be only superficial. In some instances, voice is defined nearly the same as style; in others, as genre, literary mode, point of view, mood, or tone.\n\n"}
