Episodes last several minutes, in which the interviewer (Galifianakis) and guests trade barbs and insults. In addition to the online series, an episode was filmed for Comedy Central as a television special. The series' theme music is Dave Blume's arrangement of Bernard Herrmann's theme from \"Taxi Driver,\" which is on the original \"Taxi Driver\" soundtrack album but was not included in the film.\n\nAs the show's title suggests, host Zach Galifianakis interviews celebrities while sitting between two potted ferns. The set intentionally resembles a low-budget amateur production for public-access television, with on-screen graphics containing deliberate comedic errors. For example, in a 2014 episode, Brad Pitt's name is spelled \"Bart Pit\" and his film \"12 Years a Slave\" — the winner of the 2013 Academy Award for Best Picture — entitled \"12 Years a Salve.\"\n\nGalifianakis maintains a very awkward and often antagonistic demeanor with his guests, asking them bizarre, inappropriate or insulting questions mixed with offhand \"non-sequiturs\". The guests' responses are mostly improvised, despite pre-interviews. Episodes often include a segment in which Galifianakis awkwardly interrupts his guests to promote a sponsor's product. Examples include bananas, the video game \"\", and (most frequently) Speed Stick deodorant. Some advertisements, like the graphics, are based around aspects of or events related to the interviewee. For example, the episode featuring Hillary Clinton included one of Donald Trump's campaign commercials.\n\nThe show originated as a short film on Scott Aukerman and B. J. Porter's Fox sketch pilot \"The Right Now! Show\", a spin-off of their \"Comedy Death-Ray\" live show. After the network declined to pick up the show, the duo put the short up on the website Funny Or Die, where it made a successful transition to an internet series.\n\nDiscussing the show on \"ABC News Now\", Galifianakis said, \"The ic way that Hollywood machine runs – it's fun to make fun of it. That's how \"Between Two Ferns\" started.\" Guests aren't told what will happen in advance, according to Galifianakis, \"They agree to come. There is no discussion beforehand...It just happens, no real prep, no organization whatsoever.\" He continues, \"Inappropriateness is really fun to me...That is kind of the take on \"Between Two Ferns\" – inappropriate humor.\"\n\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\" described it as \"surreal improv...a talk show that's more of a charming critique of the faked intimacy of celebrity interviews than a talk show.\"\n\nA 30-minute television special, \"Between Two Ferns: A Fairytale of New York\", aired on Comedy Central on May 6, 2012. The show featured interviews with Tina Fey, Jon Stewart, and Richard Branson.\n\nThe episode featuring President Barack Obama was timed to encourage Americans to sign up for health insurance at Healthcare.gov. Funnyordie.com became the top referrer to the government site during this time. The September 2013 episode featuring Justin Bieber also received significant media attention. The show opened with Galifianakis telling him, \"It's really exciting to talk to you. Especially right in the middle of your public meltdown.\"\n\nThe 2014 episode featuring Brad Pitt, in which he was referred to as both \"Bradley Pitts\" and \"Bart Pit,\" was called one of the funniest episodes by media. Galifianakis referred to Pitt's latest film, \"Fury\" as \"Furry,\" and asked Pitt, \"Is it hard for you to maintain a suntan...because you live in your wife's shadow?\" Galifianakis also asked Pitt if his relationship with wife, Angelina Jolie, was anything like \"Ross and Rachel\" from \"Friends\", the show that made a star of Pitt's ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston.\n\nIn a January 2016 interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\", while promoting \"Baskets\", Galifianakis discussed the status of \"Between Two Ferns\", stating: \"I don't know what else to do ... [Between Two Ferns'] kind of run its course a bit.\" Galifianakis also expressed his desire to interview the Pope on the show. \"Between Two Ferns\"' first new episode in almost two years aired in September 2016. It featured then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and received over 30 million views in its first 24 hours, the highest viewership in FunnyorDie.com's history.\n\nA special episode aired on television on Comedy Central on May 6, 2012.\n\n"}

There are several systems in use and letter G is assigned for the European UHF system which is also used in the majority of Asian and African countries. (However some countries in Europe use different systems.)\n\nSome of the important specs are listed below.\nA frame is the total picture. The frame rate is the number of pictures displayed in one second. But each frame is actually scanned twice interleaving odd and even lines. Each scan is known as a field (odd and even fields.) So field rate is twice the frame rate. In each frame there are 625 lines (or 312.5 lines in a field.) So line rate (line frequency) is 625 times the frame frequency or 625•25=15625 Hz.\n\nThe RF parameters of the transmitted signal are exactly the same as those for System B which is used on the 7.0 MHz wide channels of the VHF bands. The only difference is the width of the guard band between the channels, which on System G is 1.0 MHz wider than for System B: in other words 1.15 MHz (assuming the worst case which is when NICAM sound is in use).\n\nA few countries (Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands) use a variant of system G which is known as System H. System H is similar to system G but the lower (vestigial) side band is 500 kHz wider. This makes much better use of the 8.0 MHz channels of the UHF bands by reducing the width of the guard-band by 500 kHz to the still perfectly generous value of 650 kHz.\n\n\n"}

The frequency range allocated to this channel is important for radio astronomy, so broadcasting is not licensed.\n\nChannel 37 in System M and N countries occupies a band of UHF frequencies from 608 to 614 MHz. This band is particularly important to radio astronomy because it allows observation in a region of the spectrum in between the dedicated frequency allocations near 410 MHz and 1.4 GHz. The area reserved or unused differs from nation to nation and region to region (as for example the EU and British Isles have slightly different reserved frequency areas).\n\nOne radio astronomy application in this band is for very-long-baseline interferometry.\n\nWhen UHF channels were being allocated in the United States in 1952, channel 37 was assigned to 18 communities across the country. One of them, Valdosta, Georgia, featured the only construction permit ever issued for channel 37: WGOV-TV, owned by Eurith Dickenson \"Dee\" Rivers Jr., son of the former governor of Georgia (hence the call letters). Rivers received the CP on February 26, 1953, but WGOV-TV never made it to the air; on October 28, 1955 they requested an allocation on channel 8, but the petition was denied.\n\nIn 1963, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted a 10-year moratorium on any allocation of stations to Channel 37. A new ban on such stations took effect at the beginning of 1974, and was made permanent by a number of later FCC actions. As a result of this, and similar actions by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, Channel 37 has never been used by any over-the-air television station in Canada or the United States.\n\nReservations and use outside the US have a non-exclusive legal status\n\nSince July 2000, Channel 37 may be used in the US for medical telemetry equipment on a co-primary basis.

Additional channels from 38 to 51 (600 MHz band) are being taken away from TV broadcasters after FCC auction 1000 ended in early 2017, which will leave channel 37 as a guard band between repacked TV stations and more mobile networks, for which T-Mobile USA won most of the licenses.\n\nCertain channels, 14 through 20, are used for land mobile communications in some large metropolitan areas in the U.S. However, facilities using this decades-old co-allocation are just treated as another station to avoid interference to in their local area.\n\nThe channels displayed by cable converter boxes under these numbers are not on the same frequencies as their over-the-air counterparts; there are also virtual channel numbering schemes in use in digital television which do not map directly to fixed frequency channel assignments. As such, a \"cable 37\" channel may (and most often does) exist, but on a much lower frequency.\n\nChannel 37 is sometimes seen in fiction, the same way telephone numbers with the \"555\" telephone exchange prefix are used.\n\nChannel 37 has been used as a hypothetical example in instruction manuals, where it serves a role analogous to the fictitious example.org and example.net Internet domains and the IP address.\n\nOutside North America, channel 37 is actively used in these countries where NTSC-M is used:\n\nIn these other countries, the frequency allocation for these TV channels is different:\n\nChannel 37 is not the same frequency as it is in the countries using the System-M/N standard.

The UK-named 34-37 channel range is no longer reserved in this manner.\n\nIn Japan, UHF television channel frequencies are offset by one channel compared to North American channel naming convention.

{"id": "3138422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3138422", "title": "Charles Hicks", "text": "Charles Hicks\n\nCharles Barney Hicks (? – 1902) was an African-American advance man, manager, performer, and owner of blackface minstrel troupes composed of African-American performers. Hicks himself was a talented minstrel performer who could sing and play challenging roles such as the minstrel-show interlocutor or endmen. However, he was most interested in the business side of minstrelsy. Over the course of his career, he worked with most successful black minstrel troupes as manager, owner or both. The white-dominated minstrel market proved hostile to a black owner, and Hicks (like his contemporary, Lew Johnson) had to travel abroad or manage for white owners in order to make a reliable living. Nevertheless, both white and black rivals came to respect him. One observer in 1891 wrote, \"This man Hicks was a dangerous man to all outside managers and they all were afraid of him.\" In 1912, Hicks was the sole African American listed on M. B. Leavitt's list of \"best known advance agents during the last fifty years\".\n\nHicks's first major accomplishment was the key role he played in 1865 to form Brooker and Clayton's Georgia Minstrels. He served as the manager and probably performed with them during a tour through the Northeastern United States in 1865-6. Hicks and company became the first black minstrel troupe to have a successful season.\n\nHicks left Brooker and Clayton's in 1866 to try his hand at owning and managing a company of his own, becoming the first black man to do both simultaneously. Over the next four years, Hicks started and disbanded a number of unsuccessful groups. He played up his black minstrels' connection to legitimate black culture with names like the Slave Troupe or the Georgia Slave Brothers, and evidence suggests that Hicks's companies did draw significant numbers of black viewers. In early 1869, a Pittsburgh newspaper reported that the \"colored element of the city turned out en masse\" to see Hicks's Georgia Slave Troupe. In 1870, Hicks and his partner Bob Height led Hicks and Height's Georgia Minstrels on tour in Germany, the first black minstrel troupe to perform in that country. \n\nHicks left mid-tour to star with Sam Hague's Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels. He also became a correspondent for the New York entertainment journal, \"The Clipper\", a position he used to tout his accomplishments abroad. Upon their return to the United States in 1872, the troupe was bought by Charles Callender, and Hicks stayed on until 1873 as business manager. He next managed two more ill-fated troupes, Charles Hick's African Minstrels and Charles Hick's Georgia Minstrels. His next job was as manager of Sprague and Blodgett's Georgia Minstrels in 1876.\n\nIn 1877, Hicks lured a company away from promoter J. H. Haverly and Tom Maguire and called them Hick's [sic] Georgia Minstrels. Within a few months, Hicks led them to a tour in Australia. They played there for three years, during which Hicks wrote again for \"The Clipper\". Hicks also perfected his flair for promotion in Australia. Ads raved, \"PIRATES BEWARE! WE ARE STILL ON THE WAR PATH\" and \"THE HEROES OF MONTREAL, SARATOGA, CHICAGO, SAN FRANCISCO AND NOW AUSTRALIA STILL LIVE!\" He advertised his return to U.S. soil in July 1880 with an ad that read, \"MISSING MAN TURNS UP HOME AGAIN.\" Over the next few years, he managed and performed with a number of troupes owned by others.\n\nIn late 1881 or early 1882, Hicks persuaded Callender's current black troupe to join him in western New York. On Callender's orders, Gustave and Charles Frohman won them back, possibly by threatening to blacklist the wayward performers. Hicks's later stint as business manager for A. D. Sawyer and Tom McIntosh failed, possibly indicating that Hicks had himself been blacklisted.\n\nIn 1885, Hicks managed Billy Kersands's troupe but left after less than a year. He again formed his own company, this time with A. D. Sawyer. They bickered, and within a year, they were managing rival troupes, both under the name Hicks and Sawyer's Consolidated Colored Minstrels. Hicks's portion failed to make money, so he moved to playing dime shows, museums, and other lower-paying venues. Eventually, Hicks formed another troupe and took them to Australia, New Zealand, and other Pacific countries. He died in 1902 in Suraboya, Java.\n\n"}

It was created by Kate Hackett and stars Kate Hackett, Tony Noto, Elise Cantu, and Chris O'Brien. It premiered on YouTube on March 4, 2014 and concluded on January 12, 2016. and was picked up by Amazon on May 19, 2017.\n\nClassic Alice is divided into narrative arcs that correspond with the books main character Alice is reading, with overarching storylines and character development running throughout. The book arcs to date have centered on \"Crime and Punishment\", \"Pygmalion\", \"The Butterfly,\" \"Macbeth\", \"Rip van Winkle\", \"The Wind in the Willows\", \"A Christmas Carol\", \"Walden\", \"North and South\", \"The Odyssey\", \"Dracula\", \"Silas Marner\", and finally \"Persuasion\".\n\nThe show began with weekly vlog-style episodes shot in Alice's bedroom; the first six episodes \"...[act] as a sort of pilot for the series when watched all at once\". Beginning with the second book arc, \"Pygmalion\", vlog-style episodes on Tuesdays were followed by short reality TV-style confessional videos featuring various characters on Thursdays. In the eighth book arc, \"Walden\", the show expanded beyond the vlog format and incorporated a larger variety of styles and settings.\n\nClassic Alice begins when college student Alice Rackham gets a bad grade because her professor doesn't think she's connecting emotionally with the books she's reading. She decides to start living her life according to the actions of characters in classic novels, and her film student friend Andrew makes a vlog-style documentary about it. In \"Crime and Punishment\", Alice steals a test, but before she can turn herself in and deal with the consequences, Andrew takes responsibility for her actions and uses his father's money and influence to avoid punishment. This causes a rift between Andrew and Alice, who only lets him continue with the project when he promises to stop interfering with her actions.\n\nIn \"Pygmalion\", Alice makes over nerdy student Ewan McBay and dates him briefly, but he quickly abandons her in his quest for power and popularity. She reacts, in \"The Butterfly,\" by enlisting her cousin Reagan to help her date more and trying to meet men at events like a football game and speed dating. Ewan returns in \"Macbeth\", when he uses his new social capital to oust the student government president and try to seize power himself. Alice runs against him and wins, but not before Ewan's dirty campaign tactics hurt the people she cares about. Meanwhile, Andrew's girlfriend, jealous of the time he's spending with Alice, gives him an ultimatum, and he breaks up with her rather than leave the project. Alice recovers from the stress of the election in \"Rip van Winkle\", when she and Andrew ignore school for a week in favor of drinking and bowling. Alice has a crisis of confidence about her writing, and Andrew secretly submits one of her stories to literary magazines.\n\nIn \"The Wind in the Willows\", Alice tries to act impetuously by briefly getting a belly button ring. She and Andrew join Reagan for a disastrous family Thanksgiving, after which Alice is injured in a car accident while out with Reagan. This makes her question the project and, after they almost kiss and she pulls away, her friendship with Andrew. She tries to continue the project on her own with \"A Christmas Carol\", but the book causes her to reflect on her life and admit to herself that she loves Andrew. She finds out that the story Andrew submitted is being published, finally making her feel like a real writer, and at the end of the arc she tells Andrew about her feelings for him and they begin dating.\n\nAfter a small hiatus during which the crew raised funds for \"Books 8+\", Alice and Andrew returned in \"Walden\". Alice and the unseen cameraman, Nathan, pressure Andrew into starting the project again and they do so on a camping trip. There, they run into Marcus who explains the merits of 'living off the land'. Alice and Andrew then pack up and head to Andrew's parents' house, where they will stay while Alice interns at Crestview Publishing. She begins living \"North and South\" while struggling to accept Andrew's father's business models for his publishing firm. She also has trouble finding another magazine to publish more of her work. By the end, Alice is disheartened with her boyfriend's family, her writing, the publishing industry, and Andrew. During the same time, Cara and Lily are documenting their internship and experiences in Los Angeles on \"Musica Mundana\", a Classic Alice spinoff. They too have relationship issues, but they work their problems out by communicating. They head home to Valeton with their characteristically strong camaraderie.\n\nWith the summer ending, Alice and Andrew head back to Valeton and Alice begins to relive \"The Odyssey\". The relationship, however, is very strained; the events of North and South have created a clear rift. They manage to get back to school, but it is unclear whether or not they have weathered the storm. Once back at school, Alice learns that the subletters who took over the apartment for the summer refuse to leave. She and Cara devise a very Odysseus-like plan to trick them out of the house: they're going to throw a huge party. At the party, Andrew lets it slip that he submitted Alice's stories to magazines using his father's name. Alice is visibly angry and uses her sexuality to coerce a fellow student, Brad, to help displace the subletters.\n\nThe girls are back in their home and Alice decides to pick up \"Dracula\"—but this time, she's not going to be the hero. She decides to play Dracula. The consequences are fairly dire: Alice loses her reputation and, to some extent, her friends. She works to repair the damage in her next book, \"Silas Marner\" and finds that forgiveness does come - but it's a difficult road. As Alice picks up her next book, \"Persuasion\" by Jane Austen, she has even more to untangle—is this project working? is it even worth it?\n\n\n\nClassic Alice \"...is truly a transmedia experience\"; it expands its world beyond its videos by using transmedia to provide an immersive experience for fans. Characters use Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook accounts, as well as less common social media sites that fit their individual interests, such as Goodreads and Instagram. Classic Alice also uses other innovative forms of transmedia to flesh out its world, including university newspaper The Ocelot Call, podcasts recorded in-world by characters about books, movies, and music, and an interactive fan literary magazine.\n\nFurthermore, in 2015, Kate Hackett in association with The Horizon Factory announced an upcoming app for the entire show and all of its transmedia elements. The app is coming in winter 2015/early 2016 and will include not only the video episodes from the show, but also all of the digital content ever released - and bonus footage/material. It promises to help further the legacies of these transmedia shows by ensuring that they live on in a format that behooves them. Classic Alice is not the first app the Horizon Factory has developed, but it is the first transmedia show in its entirety and of this depth.\n\nClassic Alice has received many positive reviews from publications including GeekyNews, The Daily Dot, .Mic, WPCC, and more. Reading Rainbow called the show \"smart, funny, and absolutely addictive,\" while Tubefilter pointed out that \"the decision to spread a narrative across multiple books keeps Classic Alice fresh while still allowing it to develop its characters in the way its fans want.\" Hello Giggles included the show on their list of \"Literary-Inspired Web Series You Should Be Watching,\" and it appeared on New Media Rockstars' Weekend Web Series Watch List. Hypable has commended the series' writing and calls it both \"entertaining\" and \"original\"; they \"...commend the writers’ decision to use a less pop culture-saturated book to start out with; it’d have been all too easy to go with a Jane Austen or a Charles Dickens.\". Mic highlighted the show as one of the shows that users should be watching.\n\nAfterEllen has also kept an eye on the show for its positive portrayal of lesbian characters; calling the show \"a charming web series\" and directing its followers to both the main show and the Musica Mundana spinoff, which centered around Alice's roommate Cara.\n\n"}

A special section of a record store devoted to such items was known as the cut-out bin or bargain bin.\n\nAs tapes and CDs supplanted LPs, the mechanisms for indicating a cut-out changed. On cassettes, a hole tended to be punched or burned through the case and through its printed insert. On CDs (a practice that continues today), a section of varying size is taken out of the spine of the jewel case and its paper track listing. Other methods of cutting CDs include punching a hole through the UPC and clipping a corner off of the front insert.\n\nCut-outs are typically wholesaled to retailers as non-returnable items, meaning that the store cannot send them back to the distributor for a refund; the reason for the cut or hole in the packaging is to mark the item as non-returnable. The marking also serves to prevent the retailer from selling the discounted item at full price. Recording artists also typically do not get full royalties from cut-outs, since they're sold at a \"promotional\" cost, far less than the retail price. Except for the physical damage to the liner notes and outer case, the inner disc (LP or CD) is generally unharmed by the cut-out process, and sounds exactly the same as the originally sold recording.\n\nBesides the use by means of a discounted item, the cut-out method is also commonly used by record companies to mark copies that were sent out for promotional use to third parties like radio stations and DJs. This prevents them from being returned via the retail channel for a refund.\n\nA similar cut-out procedure was practiced with the laserdisc home video format as well as the 8-track tape cartridge. The practice has also been extended to DVDs, Blu-ray discs, and other home video physical formats.\n\nCut-out () cassettes and CDs played an important role in the development of rock music in China. Dakou was the major and often the only source of foreign rock and pop music in China.\n\n"}

She met her husband Peter while both were attending Syracuse.\n\nAfter working at Foote, Cone & Belding, Nelson served as Director of National Promotions for Walt Disney Records and moved to Warner Bros. in 1996, where she oversaw the cross-company brand management of the \"Harry Potter\" property. She became the Executive Vice President, Global Brand Management in May 2004.\n\nIn September 2009, Warner Bros. announced that DC Comics would become a subsidiary of DC Entertainment, Inc. and Nelson would serve as President of the new division. Nelson reported to Jeff Robinov, president of Warner Bros. Pictures Group. She appointed Jim Lee and Dan DiDio as Co-Publishers of DC Comics and Geoff Johns as Chief Creative Officer on February 18, 2010.\n\nAfter Kevin Tsujihara became chairman and CEO of Warner Bros.

In 2013, Nelson detailed some of the future film plans for DC properties and stated that a \"Sandman\" film will be \"as rich as the \"Harry Potter\" universe.\" Later that year, Nelson announced the decision to relocate DC's offices from New York City to Burbank, California. She explained that \"it was never optimal to run any business, but certainly not a creative business, on two coasts.\"\n\nAt a 2014 Time Warner shareholders meeting, Nelson addressed the need for greater visibility of female characters and creators in DC's comics and film and television projects. Earlier in the year, Nelson had described Wonder Woman as her favorite character, stating \"I would be lying if I didn’t admit that Wonder Woman has an affinity for me...She’s an incredibly strong representative woman. So when I think about women in business and that balance between compassion and being a warrior, there’s just a lot in the character that really resonates for me.\"\n\nIn August 2015, Nelson was given oversight over Warner Bros Consumer Products. Warner Bros CEO Kevin Tsujihara stated \"Diane's background, which includes a great balance of business, creative and marketing, will help us bring fans exciting news ways to enjoy all of Warner Bros.’ great entertainment properties through wide-reaching, innovative consumer products experiences.\"\n\nAfter a leave of absence starting in March 2018, Nelson resigned as DC Entertainment president.\n\nNelson oversees the \"We Can Be Heroes\" campaign which has raised more than $2.3 million as of 2013 for hunger and drought relief in the Horn of Africa. She serves on the board of directors for \"There With Care\", a nonprofit organization that supports families with children affected by critical illness.\n\nNelson, \"Wonder Woman\" actresses Gal Gadot and Lynda Carter, \"Wonder Woman\" director Patty Jenkins and U.N. Under-Secretary General Cristina Gallach appeared at the United Nations in October 2016, the 75th anniversary of the first appearance of Wonder Woman, to mark the character's designation by the United Nations as its \"Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls\". The gesture was intended to raise awareness of UN Sustainable Development Goal No. 5, which seeks to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls by 2030.\n\nIn December 2013, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" ranked Nelson as #39 on its \"2013 Women in Entertainment Power 100\" list. In July 2017, Nelson was awarded the Arents Award which is Syracuse University's highest alumni honor.\n\n"}

The lyrics are simple, and heard only at the beginning and the end. The track was recorded at Ultrasonic Studios in Hempstead, Long Island, New York.\n\nIn 2009, it was named the 24th-greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1. It is also often regarded as an influence on heavy metal music and one of the firsts of the genre. The song was featured in the \"Seinfeld\" episode \"The Slicer\", \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Bart Sells His Soul\" and the \"Home Improvement\" episode \"Flying Sauces\".\n\nThough it was not recorded until their second album, \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" was written during Iron Butterfly's early days. According to drummer Ron Bushy, organist/vocalist Doug Ingle wrote the song one evening while drinking an entire gallon of Red Mountain wine. When the inebriated Ingle then played the song for Bushy, who wrote down the lyrics for him, he was slurring his words so badly that what was supposed to be \"in the Garden of Eden\" was interpreted by Bushy as \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\".\n\nEven though nearly all of Iron Butterfly's songs were quite structured, the idea of turning the minute-and-a-half long ballad into an extended jam emerged very early; Jeff Beck claims that when he saw Iron Butterfly perform at the Galaxy Club in April 1967, half a year before the band recorded their first album, their entire second set consisted of a 35-minute long version of \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\".\n\n\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" was released as a 45 rpm single in the US and other territories. The 17-minute original version was edited down to 2:53. This version contains the intro, two complete verses, the repeat of the main theme very near the end, a short break, and the closing segment. All of the solos are edited out. The single reached #30 on the U.S. Billboard chart.\n\nIn the Netherlands (and perhaps other territories, too), a different, longer 4-minute, 14-second edit was released first on a 45 with catalogue number 2019 021 and later on an EP with catalogue number 2091 213. This edit features only one verse, a large portion of the drum solo, the final verse, and the closing segment.\n\nAnother edit, supplied to some radio stations, runs at 5:04. It includes the first verse, about 20 seconds each of the organ and guitar solos, part of the drum solo segueing into the drum/bass solo, the final verse, and the closing of the song.\n\nA European compilation album on the EVA label (EMI, Virgin, BMG, Ariola) entitled \"Pop Classics 2\", features a 10:26 edit of \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\". The original soundtrack CD of the movie \"Manhunter\" features an 8:20 edit of the song. In these edits, mostly the guitar solos were edited out.\n\nA live version over 19 minutes long was released as part of their 1969 live album, simply titled \"Live\". This version lengthens the drum solo by roughly four minutes and the organ solo by about one minute. It also omits the bass and drum solo jam (heard from 13:04–15:19 on the studio recording).\n\nWhen Doug Ingle wrote the song, he had not intended for it to run 17 minutes long. However, Ingle said that he \"knew there would be slots for solos\". During live renditions, Erik Brann's (guitar) and Ron Bushy's (drum) solos varied from performance to performance, while Ingle's organ solo remained the same.\n\n\"Children of Paradise\" / \"Gadda-Da-Vida\" is a 1980 single by disco band Boney M. Intended to be the first single off the group's fifth album \"Boonoonoonoos\" (scheduled for a November 1980 release), the single was ultimately never included because the album release was delayed for one year. \"Children of Paradise\" peaked at number 11 in the German charts, whereas it became the group's lowest-placing single in the UK at number 66. Boney M. used the double A-side format in this period, typically with the A1 being the song intended for radio and A2 being more squarely aimed at discos. The sides usually were switched on the accompanying 12\" single.\n\n\"Gadda-Da-Vida\" became a controversial Boney M. record since none of the original members sang on it. Because of a fall-out between producer Frank Farian and the group, he had session singers La Mama (Cathy Bartney, Patricia Shockley, and Madeleine Davis) sing the female vocals while he did the deep male vocals, as usual. The group only promoted it once on TV. Two different single edits were done of the full 9-minute version that appeared on the 12-inch single. \"Gadda-Da-Vida\" was the A-side in Japan. Only the French release correctly stated the song title as \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\".\n\n7-inch singles\n\n12-inch single\n\nMichael Viner's Incredible Bongo Band covered the song in 1973. Samples from this version are used in the Nas songs \"Thief's Theme\" and \"Hip Hop Is Dead\".\n\nThe power metal band Blind Guardian released a remastered version of \"Gada-Da-Vida\" as a single. The Thrash metal band Slayer recorded a short and fast version of this song for the movie soundtrack of \"Less Than Zero\".\n\nThe composer and percussionist David Van Tieghem released a version and two remixes in 1986.\n\nPortions of the song are featured in an episode of \"The Simpsons\", \"Bart Sells His Soul\", in which Bart Simpson tricks Reverend Lovejoy's church into singing the song as an opening hymn by handing out sheet music titled \"In the Garden of Eden\" by \"I. Ron Butterfly\". Lovejoy describes the hymn as \"sound[ing] like rock and/or roll\".\n\nMojo Nixon and Skid Roper recorded the song on their album \"Frenzy\".\n\nNash the Slash recorded an 8:55 version of the song on his 2008 album \"In-a-Gadda-Da-Nash\".\n\nAvant-garde group The Residents included this song in a medley of other 1960s pop covers on their 1976 album \"The Third Reich 'n Roll\".\n\nNew Jersey psychedelic band 6 Feet Under recorded a version in the late 1960s.\n"}

The series, described by Waid as a \"dramedy\", follows an estranged superhero team; the dedicated hero Nocturnus, and his arrogant, egotistical former sidekick Galahad, who are forced to reunite to tackle a new case. \"Insufferable\" reunited Waid with his \"Irredeemable\" creative team, artist Peter Krause and colorist Nolan Woodward. The series began publication on May 1, 2012, as Thrillbent's launch title.\n\n\"Insufferable\" was first announced on April 14, 2012, at the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo as the first series to be released on Waid's new online digital comic publishing platform \"Thrillbent\".\n\nThe first issue of \"Insufferable\" was released on May 1, 2012 on Thrillbent. The comic reunites Waid with his creative team from the finished comic series \"Irredeemable\"; artist Peter Krause, colorist Nolan Woodward, and letterer Troy Petrie. Waid designed the comic specifically for digital release as opposed to comics which are designed for print and also released digitally. Remarking on the flexibility of digital comics allowing long, short, and one-off series, Waid stated \"I can see [\"Insufferable\"] ending at some point, but I also see how we can do sequels\".\n\nUnlike traditional print comics, \"Insufferable\" is intended to be released in a 4 x 3 landscape format to allow pages to fit comfortably on standard horizontal monitors and similar viewing devices. Speaking about the format decision, Waid said \"I hate, with a white hot passion, digital comics where I only get to see a little bit of the screen as I go and I have to scroll around to get the sense of what the whole page [is]\". Waid claimed that releasing the comic digitally was the only option available, as he was not able to afford the cost of releasing it in print, and was selling off his collection of print comics to raise funds for the venture. Additionally he financially partnered with comic writer and television producer John Rogers, and provides his collaborators, like Krause, with co-ownership, trading initially lower rates of payment for potential larger future gains if the series is a success. Waid claimed that if the series was successful and profitable, future releases in print would be possible. In October 2013, issues 1-8 were collected in print.\n\nVolume 2 finished on November 30, 2013, and the first issue of volume 3 was released on November 12, 2014 after a one-year absence. Releases have not followed the weekly schedule as was planned, with the 16th issue being released on April 22, 2015.\n\nIn April, Waid described the setting as what happens when a hero has a kid sidekick who grows up to be a \"completely ungrateful, self-aggrandizing,\" \"douchebag\" who \"will not shut up about how much of a genius he is and how the world is a better place now that [the hero team] are broken up because now he can do it all the way he wanted to do it.\" The series follows the events that force the hero and the former sidekick to reunite in spite of their mutual hatred for one another.\n\n"}

{"id": "36954443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36954443", "title": "James Bond filmography", "text": "James Bond filmography\n\nCommander James Bond RN—code number 007—is a fictional character created by the British journalist and novelist Ian Fleming in 1952. The character appeared in a series of twelve novels and two short story collections written by Fleming and a number of continuation novels and spin-off works after Fleming's death in 1964. There have been twenty-six films in total, produced between 1962 and 2015.\n\nFleming portrayed Bond as a tall, athletic, handsome secret agent in his thirties or forties; he has several vices including drinking, smoking, gambling, automobiles and womanising. He is an exceptional marksman, and skilled in unarmed combat, skiing, swimming and golf. While Bond kills without hesitation or regret, he usually kills only when carrying out orders, while acting in self-defence and occasionally as revenge.\n\nAmerican actor Barry Nelson was the first to portray Bond on screen, in a 1954 television adaptation, \"Casino Royale\". In 1961 Eon Productions began work on \"Dr. No\", an adaptation of the novel of the same name. The result was a film that spawned a series of twenty-four films produced by Eon Productions and two independent films. After considering the likes of \"refined\" English actors such as Cary Grant and David Niven, the producers cast Sean Connery as Bond in the film. Fleming was appalled at the selection of the uncouth, 31-year-old Scottish actor, considering him to be the antithesis of his character. However, Connery's physical prowess and sexual magnetism in the role came to be closely identified with the character, with Fleming ultimately changing his view on Connery and incorporating aspects of his portrayal into the books.\n\nSeven actors in total have portrayed Bond on film. Following Connery's portrayal, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig have assumed the role. These screen versions have retained many traits from Fleming's depiction, although some of Bond's less fashionable attitudes have been dropped, such as racism, homophobia, retaining the services of a maid, and in the more recent films, smoking. Despite playing the same character, there have been notable differences among the portrayals. Daniel Craig is the incumbent Bond in the long-running Eon series, and played the part for a fourth time in the latest film, \"Spectre\", released in October 2015.\n\nA Secret Service agent, James Bond was a composite based on a number of commandos whom author Ian Fleming had known during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, to whom he added his own style and a number of his own tastes. Fleming appropriated his character's name from the eponymous American ornithologist. Bond's code number 007 comes from one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I: the breaking of the German diplomatic code. One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which was coded 0075, and which was one of the factors that led the US entering the war. Subsequently, if material was graded 00 it meant it was highly classified. Fleming later told a journalist: \"When I was at the Admiralty ... all the top-secret signals had the double-0 prefix ... and I decided to borrow it for Bond.\"\n\nAlthough James Bond is in his mid-to-late thirties, he does not age in Fleming's stories. Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett noted that, \"within the first few pages [of \"Casino Royale\"] Ian had introduced most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks\", which included his looks, his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits: Bond's penchant for alcohol runs throughout the series of books and he smokes up to 70 cigarettes a day.\n\nFleming decided to underplay Bond's character, observing: \"Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure.\" On another occasion, he reinforced his point: \"When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument.\"\n\nSean Connery was the first actor to portray Bond on film in \"Dr. No\" (1962). An amateur bodybuilder, he had come to the attention of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s. At a muscular 6'2\", Connery was initially met with disapproval from Fleming, who believed him to be an overgrown stuntman who lacked the finesse and elegance to play James Bond; he envisaged a suave actor, such as David Niven playing the role. Producer Albert R. Broccoli—known to all as Cubby—disagreed with Fleming's view, later commenting that \"I wanted a ballsy guy ... put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job\". Eon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal, an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said, after appearing with Connery in \"Goldfinger\", \"He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy and that really was the tenor of what the script was always trying to display\". After Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor \"in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool\".\n\nConnery's interpretation of the character differed considerably from Fleming's, being more promiscuous and cold blooded than the literary version. Connery described Bond as \"a complete sensualist—senses highly tuned, awake to everything, quite amoral. I particularly like him because he thrives on conflict\". Academic James Chapman observed that for \"Dr. No\", Connery's interpretation of the character, although not complete, showed the actor \"should be credited with having established a new style of performance: a British screen hero in the manner of an American leading man\". In his second film, \"From Russia with Love\", Connery looked less nervous and edgy; he gave \"a relaxed, wry performance of subtle wit and style\". Pfeiffer and Worrall noted that Connery \"personified James Bond with such perfection that even Ian Fleming ... admitted that it was difficult imagining anyone else in the part\"; academic Jeremy Black agreed and declared that \"Connery made the role his own and created the Bond audience for the cinema\". Black also observed that Connery gave the character a \"spare, pared-down character ... [with] inner bleakness along with the style\". Connery played Bond with \"the right mix of cool charisma, violence and arrogance ... against which all others are judged\". Raymond Benson perceived that Connery \"embodies a ruggedness and an intense screen presence this transcends any preconceived notions about the character\". Benson also noted that Bond was witty, but contains \"an assured toughness that epitomises the machismo male\". Roger Moore agreed with Black and Benson, commenting that \"Sean \"was\" Bond. He created Bond. He embodied Bond and because of Sean, Bond became an instantly recognisable character the world over—he was rough, tough, mean and witty ... he was a bloody good 007\". However, despite his charm and virility, Connery was characteristically laconic in his delivery. Christopher Bray says of him that \"in his single-minded, laconic, mocking, self-sufficient vanity, Connery's Bond was the epitome of sixties consumer culture\".\nInterviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery identified where he had altered the character for the films, saying \"I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd have to let me play him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh. They agreed, and there you are: today Bond is accepted to such an extent that even philosophers take the trouble to analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him. And even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously\". Connery went on to add that \"Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival. And then one can't help liking him\". After the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film \"You Only Live Twice\" saying, \"It became a terrible pressure, like living in a goldfish bowl ... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond. Also I had become completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring\".\n\nAfter a hiatus of one film—\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", in which George Lazenby played Bond—Connery returned to the role for \"Diamonds Are Forever\" after David Picker, the head of United Artists, made it clear that Connery was to be enticed back to the role and that money was no object. When approached about resuming the role of Bond, Connery demanded—and received—a fee of £1.25 million (£ million in pounds), 12.5% of the gross profits and, as a further enticement, United Artists offered to back two films of his choice. His performance received mixed reviews, with Raymond Benson considering that Connery \"looks weary and bored ... he is overweight, slow-moving, and doesn't seem to be trying to create a credible character\". Despite that, Benson considers that Connery \"still radiates more screen presence than Roger Moore or George Lazenby\". On the other hand, Pauline Kael said \"Connery's James Bond is less lecherous than before and less foppish—and he's better this way\".\n\nIn the early 1980s producer Jack Schwartzman moved ahead with a non-Eon Bond film, following the controversy over the 1961 novel \"Thunderball\" and the subsequent long legal battle; the result was \"Never Say Never Again\". Connery accepted an offer to play Bond once more, asking for (and receiving) a fee of $3 million ($ million in dollars), a percentage of the profits, as well as casting, director and script approval. The script has several references to Bond's advancing years—playing on Connery being 52 at the time of filming. David Robinson, reviewing the film for \"The Times\" considered that, \"Connery ... is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way\". In 2003 Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute.\n\nWhen Sean Connery had been cast in November 1961, David Niven had been Fleming's choice for the role as the actor reflected his image of the character. In 1965 producer Charles Feldman signed Niven to play Sir James Bond for \"Casino Royale\", a film not made by Eon Productions. Connery and Peter Sellers had both turned down the role. Niven was 56 when he played Bond and his characterisation was that of an elderly man who had won the Victoria Cross at the Siege of Mafeking, had a daughter by his lover, the spy Mata Hari, played Claude Debussy on the piano, ate royal jelly and cultivated black roses. The concept of Bond is that once Niven's Bond retired, his name and 007 designation was passed to another agent to keep the legend alive; James Chapman notes that the implication was that the \"other Bond\" was that played by Connery.\n\nChapman considered the concept of an elderly Bond to be an interesting one, with Bond referring to Connery's Bond as a \"sexual acrobat who leaves a trail of beautiful dead women behind like blown roses\". In line with the literary Bond, Niven's character drives a vintage Bentley, rather than the Aston Martin favoured by Connery. Bond scholar Steven Jay Rubin thought Niven perfectly cast as the retired Bond, and saw him as \"a throw-back to the hell-for-leather adventure heroes\" of the character, which paralleled Niven's own life and career. Barnes and Hearn describe this as a \"perfectly fair interpretation\", given the way Niven approached the role, while Raymond Benson thinks casting Niven was \"intelligent\". Jeremy Black questioned the use of Niven in the role, observing that he did not seem to be a killer, and did not have the \"disconcerting edge\" that Connery had.\n\nWith the departure of Connery after \"You Only Live Twice\", Broccoli and director Peter R. Hunt chose Australian George Lazenby to play the role of Bond. He first came to their attention after seeing him in a Fry's Chocolate Cream advertisement. Lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit (ordered, but uncollected, by Connery), and going to Connery's barber at the Dorchester Hotel. Lazenby consolidated his claim during a screen test, when he accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression. Lazenby never signed a contract, with negotiations dragging on during production, and he was subsequently convinced by his agent Ronan O'Rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s; as a result he left the role before the release of \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" in 1969. For his performance as Bond, Lazenby was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor at the 27th Golden Globe Awards.\n\nCritical opinion was split about Lazenby; he has been considered to have been the worst Bond, and has variously been described as \"laconic and humourless\", \"a little stiff\" and \"annoying and smug\". Derek Malcolm of \"The Guardian\" was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he \"is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache\". \"The New York Times\" critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that \"Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement\". Pauline Kael called Lazenby \"quite a dull fellow\" in her otherwise positive review in \"The New Yorker\". However, Peter R. Hunt, director of \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role, saying \"he would have made a very credible Bond and been very good indeed\".\n\nSmith and Lavington consider that Lazenby \"had chosen to play Bond the same way as Sean Connery had, with perhaps more humility and humanity\"; they went on to say that \"Lazenby's inexperience rarely shows\" in the film, and that \"he invariably rises to the occasion\". Alexander Walker in the \"London Evening Standard\" said that, \"The truth is that George Lazenby is almost as good a James Bond as the man referred to in his film as 'the other fellow'. Lazenby's voice is more suave than sexy-sinister and he could pass for the other fellow's twin on the shady side of the casino. Bond is now definitely all set for the Seventies\". Judith Crist of \"New York Magazine\" commented that, \"This time around there's less suavity and a no-nonsense muscularity and maleness to the role via the handsome Mr. Lazenby\". Feminist film critic Molly Haskell wrote an approving review in the \"Village Voice\": \"Lazenby ... seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) \"Playboy\", and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates\".\n\nJames Chapman considers that Lazenby looks the part of Bond, identifying his athleticism and \"arrogant swagger\", which \"convey the snobbery of the character\". Chapman also distinguished a more vulnerable and human characterisation in Bond—feeling exhausted and falling in love—as opposed to the \"heroic superman\" of Connery. Brian Fairbanks noted that \"\"OHMSS\" gives us a James Bond capable of vulnerability, a man who can show fear and is not immune to heartbreak. Lazenby is that man, and his performance is superb\". Ben Macintyre also observed that of all the Bonds, Lazenby's characterisation was closest to that of Fleming's original character.\n\nAfter \"Diamonds Are Forever\", Broccoli and Saltzman tried to convince Sean Connery to return as Bond, but he declined. After considering Jeremy Brett, Michael Billington and Julian Glover, the two producers finally turned to Roger Moore, who they had previously discussed for \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", but who had been unavailable, and he was ultimately cast to play Bond in \"Live and Let Die\". At the time Moore was an established television actor, known for his performances as Simon Templar in \"The Saint\" and Lord Brett Sinclair in \"The Persuaders!\": in both of which he played a \"charming, debonair, international playboy\". When playing Bond, Moore tried not to imitate either Connery or his previous roles, and screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay around Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted feel to Bond, an approach that led Raymond Benson to describe Moore's Bond as \"a rather smarmy, eyebrow-raising international playboy who never seemed to get hurt\".\n\nFilm writer Andrew Spicer considered Roger Moore to be the most elegant and mannerly of the Bonds, with the voice and style of an English debonair country gentleman. Benson agreed, stating that Moore was, \"too nice and well-mannered to be a James Bond of any real substance\", while Doug Pratt said that \"the writers worked out an amenable personality for Roger Moore and found a breezy balance between comedy and action\". To make Moore's character appear tougher, a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum — which at the time was associated with the macho image of the Clint Eastwood character, Dirty Harry — was chosen for Moore to use in \"Live and Let Die\" rather than Bond's usual choice of Walther PPK.\n\nSpicer says \"Roger Moore re-created Bond as an old-style debonair hero, more polished and sophisticated than Connery's incarnation, using the mocking insouciance he had perfected in his role as Simon Templar ... Moore's humour was a throwaway, and certainly in the later films, verged on self-parody. It was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue-in-cheek direction of the series which became more light-hearted, knowing and playfully intertextual\". Chapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds, with a more light-hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo. Additionally, Moore's one-liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke, as opposed to Connery's, which was used to mitigate the violence. Moore explained his approach to the humour by saying \"to me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous ... I mean, this man is supposed to be a spy, and yet everybody knows he's a spy ... it's outrageous. So you have to treat the humour outrageously as well\".\n\nPauline Kael was a fairly vocal critic of Moore's, dismissing him as an \"iceberg\" in \"The Man with the Golden Gun\". In reviewing \"For Your Eyes Only\", she wrote \"Roger Moore is Bond again, and his idea of Bond's imperturbable cool is the same as playing dead\". Reviewing \"Moonraker\", she wrote \"Roger Moore is dutiful and passive as Bond; his clothes are neatly pressed and he shows up for work, like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension\". Only in \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", one of Kael's favourite Bond films, did she praise him describing him as self-effacing: \"Moore gets the chance to look scaredan emotion that suits him and makes him more likable\".\nA number of Moore's personal preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits were assigned to the character. Moore's use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, \"For Your Eyes Only\", released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1985 Moore appeared in his seventh and final film, \"A View to a Kill\"; he was 57 (he appeared alongside co-star Tanya Roberts, who was 30). Critics focused on Moore's age: \"The Washington Post\" said \"Moore isn't just long in the tooth – he's got tusks, and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie-eyed blankness of a zombie. He's not believable anymore in the action sequences, even less so in the romantic scenes\". When he was cast for the film, Moore recalled that he felt \"a bit long in the tooth\", and in December 2007 admitted that he \"was only about four hundred years too old for the part\". Like Connery, Moore appeared as Bond in seven films; by the time he retired in 1985, he was the oldest actor to play 007 in the Eon series, and his Bond films had earned over at the box office.\n\nWith the retirement of Roger Moore in 1985, a search for a new actor to play Bond took place that saw a number of actors, including Sam Neill, Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton, audition for the role in 1986. Bond co-producer Michael G. Wilson, director John Glen, Dana and Barbara Broccoli \"were impressed with Sam Neill and very much wanted to use him\", although Bond producer Albert R. Broccoli was not sold on the actor. Dalton and Brosnan were both considered by Eon, but after Brosnan was eventually ruled out by his Remington Steele contract, Dalton was appointed in August 1986 on a salary of $5.2 million. When he was either 24 or 25 years old Dalton had discussed playing Bond with Broccoli, but decided he was too young to accept the role, thinking Bond should be played between 35 and 40 years old. In preparing for the role, Dalton, a green-eyed, dark haired, slender, 6'2\" (1 m 88 cm) classically trained Shakespearean actor, was keen to portray the character as accurately as possible, reading up extensively on the books before his role in \"The Living Daylights\" (1987). \n\nDalton's Bond was a serious one: dark, cold, emotional, stern, ruthless, showing little humour, and focused as a killer with little time for fun and indulgence. Dalton's interpretation of the character came from his \"desire to see a darker Bond\", one that was \"less of a womaniser, tougher and closer to the darker character Ian Fleming wrote about\". James Chapman also considered Dalton to be closer to Fleming's Bond than the previous actors, writing that Dalton was \"clearly less comfortable ... with the witty asides and one-liners ... so he becomes something closer to the Bond of the books, who rarely develops a sense of humour\". When reviewing \"Licence to Kill\", Iain Johnstone of \"The Sunday Times\" disagreed, declaring that \"any vestiges of the gentleman spy ... by Ian Fleming\" have now gone; he went on to say that \"this character is remarkably close both in deed and action to the eponymous hero of the new \"Batman\" film\".\n\nNot all viewers were taken with Dalton. Jay Scott of \"The Globe and Mail\" was entirely dismissive. \"The new Bond has been widely described in feature stories as a throwback to the Ian Fleming original (studying the Fleming novels, Dalton was pleased to discover that Bond was a human being, he says), and that may be true, if the Fleming original lacked charm, sex appeal and wit. Timothy Dalton's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity, and eschews promiscuity – Dirtless Harry. You get the feeling that on his off nights, he might curl up with the Reader's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting – he'd try to memorize the jokes – before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine. The British reviews of \"The Living Daylights\" have been laudatory, perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all, if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved\".\n\nRaymond Benson noted that Dalton \"purposely played Bond as a ruthless and serious man with very little of the wit displayed by Connery, Lazenby or Moore\", and considered him to be \"the most accurate and literal interpretation of the role ... ever seen on screen\". His character also reflected a degree of moral ambiguity; in \"Licence to Kill\", for instance, he becomes a rogue agent, while Dalton himself saw the character as a \"man, not a superhuman; a man who is beset with moral confusions and apathies and uncertainties, and who is often very frightened and nervous and tense\". Smith and Lavington observed that during Dalton's portrayal in \"Licence to Kill\", Bond appeared \"self-absorbed ... reckless, brutal, prone to nervous laughter and ... probably insane, or at least seriously disturbed. In the light of \"Licence to Kill\", one academic, Martin Willis, referred to Dalton's Bond as a \"muscular vigilante\". Steven Jay Rubin noted that Dalton's films had \"a hard-edged reality and some unflinching violent episodes that were better suited to Dalton's more realistic approach to the character\". Rubin considered Dalton's portrayal to be \"Fleming's Bond ... the suffering Bond\". In contrast to the previous incarnations of the character, Smith and Lavington identified Dalton's humour as \"brooding rather than flippant\"; combined with his heavy smoking, they considered him \"an effective leading man\". Eoghan Lyng, writing for The James Bond Dossier, favourably compared him to Daniel Craig, stating that \"Despite chronological placement, it was Dalton, not Brosnan, who proved to be the prototype for the 21st century Bond.\". Although Bond screenwriter Richard Maibaum called Sean Connery the best Bond, he considered Dalton the best actor of the four he worked with. His predecessor, Roger Moore also felt that Dalton was the best actor to play Bond. Director John Glen also felt that Dalton was the best actor that portrayed Bond, and that he was ahead of his time, noting the comparisons between Daniel Craig's incarnation to that of Dalton's.\n\nDalton's films did not perform as well at the box office as most of the previous films. Commentators such as \"Screen International\" considered the Bond series had run its course in the age of series such as Indiana Jones and \"Lethal Weapon\". Edward P. Comentale observed that \"Dalton, for all his occasional flat northern vowels, was probably too much the stage actor to be convincing as an action hero in the age of Willis, Schwarzenegger and Stallone\". After just two films—\"The Living Daylights\" and \"Licence to Kill\"—litigation ensued over the licensing of the Bond catalogue, delaying what would have been Dalton's third film by several years. His six-year contract expired in 1993 and he left the series in 1994.\n\nAfter Timothy Dalton retired from the Bond role in 1994, Eon turned to the actor they had considered after \"A View to a Kill\": Pierce Brosnan. He was offered a three-film contract, with an option on a fourth; his salary for his first film, \"GoldenEye\", was $4 million, which rose to $16.5 million for his fourth and final outing, \"Die Another Day\". Brosnan had first met Broccoli on the set of \"For Your Eyes Only\", when Brosnan's wife, Cassandra Harris, was appearing in the film as Countess Lisl von Schlaf, and the couple lunched with Broccoli during filming. Brosnan went on to play a criminal-turned-private investigator in \"Remington Steele\" in the 1980s, where he captured some of the traits of previous Bonds in playing the role: like Moore, he exemplified a high degree of suavity, elegance, charm and wit, but displayed a masculinity and grittiness on occasion reminiscent of Connery's Bond, both successfully \"combine the character's Englishness with a classless internationalism that is highly knowing\". Andrew Spicer says that \"Brosnan's frame carries the 'Armani look' with its refined understated Englishness, to perfection. His lithe, sinuous athleticism is well suited to the fast-paced action and state-of-the-art gadgetry that retains the series' core appeal\". James Chapman also considered Brosnan's appearance striking, saying the actor had \"old-fashioned, darkly handsome matinee idol looks\".\n\nWith Brosnan, the Bond writers knew that because of the changes in public attitudes, he could not be as overtly sexual and dominant over women as Connery's Bond, and was denounced by M in \"GoldenEye\" to be a \"sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War\". Brosnan was seen by many as the quintessential James Bond in appearance and manner; displaying an air of coolness, elegance and a grace which made him believable as an international playboy, if not purely as an assassin. John G. Stackhouse for instance argues that it is preposterous that any man as strikingly handsome as Brosnan and Connery could be a secret agent, saying, \"When Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan enters a room, everyone notices. Thus it is ridiculous to suppose that James Bond, looking like that, could be a secret agent for longer than about two seconds\".\n\nBrosnan's Bond was introduced in \"GoldenEye\"; James Chapman argues that the film works his portrayal of Bond into the history of the others in the series through the post-credits sequence use of the , previously seen in \"Goldfinger\" and \"Thunderball\", \"thus immediately evoking the memory of [Sean] Connery\". Brosnan's characterisation of Bond was seen by Jeremy Black as being \"closer to the Fleming novels than Moore ... yet he is also lighter and less intense than Dalton\". Black also commented that the shift in character in the first three films reflected changing social opinions, with Bond not smoking. Brosnan was clear he wanted to change Bond's smoking habit, saying \"I don't give a damn about everyone's perception of the character: I think smoking causes cancer therefore he doesn't smoke\", although he did smoke a Cuban cigar in \"Die Another Day\". Brosnan continued with the use of humour prevalent with other portrayals, and provided a \"mix of action and danger threaded through with the right amount of wit and humour\"; Smith and Lavington saw the humour largely as puns that were \"flippant, but not crass\".\n\nAfter four films in the role, Brosnan stated he wished to do one final Bond film. Although plans were made for a film to be released in 2004, negotiations stalled and Brosnan announced his intention to leave in July 2004.\n\nOn 14 October 2005 Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment announced at a press conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series. A tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat. Craig had based his acceptance of the role on the strength of the script for the first film, \"Casino Royale\"; he later recalled that \"once I sat down and read the story, I just thought that I wanted to tell [it] ... I'm a big Bond fan, and I love what he represents\". Significant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest. Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed. Many disparagingly called him \"James Blonde\", believing the blond-haired blue-eyed rugged Craig to be far fitting from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him. The \"Daily Mirror\" ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, \"The Name's Bland – James Bland\".\n\nCraig first played Bond in the 2006 film \"Casino Royale\", an adaptation of Fleming's novel of the same name and a reboot of the Eon series, which saw Bond earn his 00 status. Despite the negative press on his appointment, Craig was widely praised by critics and former Bonds after the release of \"Casino Royale\", believing him to have been the first actor to truly nail Fleming's character in the book: Todd McCarthy, reviewing the film for \"Variety\", considered that \"Craig comes closer to the author's original conception of this exceptionally long-lived male fantasy figure than anyone since early Sean Connery\", and he went on to say that \"Craig once and for all claims the character as his own\", while Steven Spielberg called Craig \"the perfect 21st-century Bond\".\nPaul Arendt, writing for the BBC, agreed, observing that \"Daniel Craig is not a good Bond. He's a \"great\" Bond. Specifically, he is 007 as conceived by Ian Fleming—a professional killing machine, a charming, cold-hearted patriot with a taste for luxury. Craig is the first actor to really nail 007's defining characteristic: he's an absolute swine\". James Chapman commented on the realism and violence in the film noting that Bond is seen to seriously bleed for the first time in the series; Chapman also identified a number of violent scenes which make \"Casino Royale\" notable in the series. In 2012 \"Skyfall\" was released: it was Craig's third outing as 007. Reviewing the film, Philip French, writing in \"The Observer\", considered that Craig managed to \"get out of the shadow of Connery\", while the \"New Statesman\" thought that he had \"relaxed into Bond without losing any steeliness\".\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n\n"}

The character was co-developed by members of the Barbelith online community. \n\nJenny Everywhere was specifically created when her creators could not find any other truly open-source or public domain characters. She is described both as existing in every reality and being able to shift between realities. This gives the character the ability to be inserted into the continuity of any existing or new work, such as various comics and webcomics. The concept may be extended to other media as well.\n\nOn creating the character, Steven Wintle described her by saying:\n\n\"She has short, dark hair. She usually wears aviation goggles on top of her head and a scarf around her neck. Otherwise, she dresses in comfortable clothes. She is average size and has a good body image. She has loads of confidence and charisma. She appears to be Asian or Native American. She has a ready smile.\"\n\nHe went on to describe her as \"if Tintin listened to Le Tigre and joined the Fantastic Four. She's excitable, passionate, attentive, curious, and caring. Like Captain Marvel, she's just a really powerful kid.\" Jenny's creation was in part inspired by Octobriana.\n\nThe creators of the character insist that any work involving her must include the following text: \"The character of Jenny Everywhere is available for use by anyone, with only one condition: This paragraph must be included in any publication involving Jenny Everywhere, that others might use this property as they wish. All rights reversed.\" This does not mean everything with Jenny Everywhere is free-use and uncopyrighted, and people may still maintain copyrights on their own unique characters and character styling, story, artwork, and title. The \"All Rights Reversed\" portion refers to the character's name, her characteristics, and the idea of the character is uncopyrightable, as Jenny Everywhere \"belongs to everyone\".\n\nBeing that Jenny Everywhere is a free-culture character with no official site or publication, it has been up to the creators of any story involving The Shifter to decide if they want to link to the continuity of other peoples' work or not. For example; in Alex Hernandez's story \"Soulless Mate\", a prominent character is one of Jenny's boyfriends from the \"My Bloody Valentine\" story. In another writer's story, this connection may not have happened.\n\nMost of the stories for Jenny Everywhere exist strictly as webcomics, and many had a science fiction or superhero theme. In 2003, Nelson Evergreen and Joe Macaré had made a limited 50-unit self-publication of their stories, \"Name's Not Down\" and \"Damn Fine Hostile Takeover\". The character of Jenny Everywhere has not been limited to independent stories, and she has appeared in a number of existing webcomics as cameos and crossovers.\n\nJenny appeared as a presenter for the 2008 Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards, presenting the category for Outstanding Character Rendering.\n\nThere have been several one-time, single strips as well that have appeared as entries to \"Strip Fight\" contests. \"Strip Fight\" is a website that hosts bi-monthly contests in which people are invited to create a single comic strip, based on a given theme. Jenny Everywhere has been the subject of two different \"Strip Fight\" contests in 2004 and 2007.\n\nIn 2008, The Shifter Archive and WAGON Webcomic Battle ran a drawing contest on the subject of Jenny Everywhere. Entrants were to compete for one of three official Jenny Everywhere game cards to be used in the WAGON Webcomic Battle Trading Card Game. Third Place was awarded to Zack Holmes, whose card was placed within the Beta Deck. Second Place was awarded to Jacob Burrows, whose card was placed in the Alpha Deck. First place was awarded to Benj Christensen, whose card was deemed a Rare and Promotional Card.

Most juggling conventions include friendly games such as endurance and gladiators. Since 1969, the International Jugglers' Association (IJA) has held annual stage championships, judged both on technique and presentation. The stage championships have three categories: Individuals, Teams and Juniors (individuals under 17 years old). First, second and third-place winners in the Stage Championships are awarded medals and money prizes. In addition the Numbers Championships awards Gold medals to those who demonstrate that they can juggle the most balls, clubs or rings for the most catches.\n\nIn recent times there has been a move to more competitive and technical juggling events. The most notable example of this is the annual World Juggling Federation (WJF) Championships. Other competitions include those produced by the International Sport Juggling Federation, and the Atlanta Jugglers Association Groundhog Day competition.\n\nOne type of competition is called combat, often known as Gladiators in Europe, is a \"last man standing\" competition, with the participating jugglers agree to maintain a base level of juggling, normally a three club cascade, within a certain area. Participants who drop a club, or go out of bounds, have lost the round and are expected to remove themselves (and their clubs if necessary) from the competition area. Although participants are not allowed to deliberately come into body to body contact with each other unless previously specified, they are allowed to use their clubs to interfere with other participants' cascades through juggling tricks. Stealing a club out of another participant's cascade, in order to replace one's own dropped or discarded club, is a common tactic. Multiple rounds may be played, with the winner being the first to win a set number of rounds, or the person with the most wins by a set end time.\n\n"}
{"id": "41716528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41716528", "title": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance", "text": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance is an action role-playing video game developed by Warhorse Studios and published by Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is set in the medieval Kingdom of Bohemia, an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire, with a focus on historically accurate content. It was released worldwide on 13 February 2018.\n\nThe story takes place during a war in Bohemia in 1403. On the orders of Hungarian king Sigismund, Cuman mercenaries raid the mining village of Skalitz, a major source of silver. One of the survivors of that massacre is Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Destitute and vengeful, Henry joins the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, who leads a resistance movement against Sigismund's invasion. As Henry pursues justice for his murdered family, he becomes involved in an effort to restore Bohemia's rightful king and Sigismund's half-brother, Wenceslaus IV, to the throne. The game features branching quest lines and an open world environment which encourages immersive gameplay, and includes early 15th century period-accurate weapons, clothing, combat techniques, and architecture recreated with the assistance of architects and historians.\n\n\"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" is an action role-playing game set in an open world environment and played from a first-person perspective which utilizes a classless RPG system, allowing the player to customize their skills to take on roles such as a warrior, bard, thief or their hybrids. Abilities and stats grow depending on what the player does and says through branched dialogue trees. During conversations, the time a player takes to make a decision is limited and will have an effect on their relationships with others. Reputation is based on player choices and therefore can bring consequences.\n\nCharacter bodies and faces are created through the combination of multiple, individual pieces with finishing touches. The clothing system features 16 item slots and items on many areas of the body that can be layered. For example, a heavily armored knight may on his upper body wear a gambeson, followed by mail and plate armour, with a tabard or surcoat over top, for a total of four clothing items in the chest slots. Each clothing type provides different levels of protection against different types of weapons. Clothing also gets progressively more worn, dirty, or bloody through use, affecting the character's appearance. The player is able to use a variety of weapons including swords, knives, axes, hammers or bows. Horses are featured heavily in the game, and are designed to act with their own AI while under the player's control, moving or jumping to avoid small obstacles or dangers. The player can also fight from horseback and use their steed to carry items if they need additional inventory space, but warhorses are also competent combatants with their own AI. Steeds come with five slots for armor and attachments.\n\n\"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" also features a needs system which requires the player to sleep and eat in order to stay healthy. Equipment and clothing also degrade and require repair. Foodstuffs and other perishable items will spoil over time. The game uses skill/stat-based mini-games for many of these tasks including weapon and armor repair, as well as for gathering new items by picking locks or pockets, distilling alcohol or creating medicines. The game uses long- and short-ranged weapons in combat which is based on a physics system using inverse kinematics to determine the reactions of both combatants based on the speed and weight of a blow. This system aims to add greater variety and realism to the combat, coupled with a variety of basic combat moves and combination moves, some of which can be unlocked by skill points. Different weapons have different characteristics making them useful for different purposes. For example, a sword is a quick weapon for striking and parrying, but is not very effective against heavy armor.\n\nQuests are intended to be nonlinear, with multiple ways to complete objectives to allow multiple character types to be viable. The storyline features some large-scale events such as castle sieges and large battles. Every non-player character (NPC) has their daily routine, and every routine can be affected by the player. Characters are able to react to all player actions and adjust their routines to them. NPCs will report crimes to authorities, who will punish the player accordingly, either with a fine or time in jail. Crime will affect economics and people will get suspicious or aggressive after unresolved crimes.\n\n\"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" takes place in the early 15th century, in the Kingdom of Bohemia, part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown and the Holy Roman Empire in what is now the Czech Republic. The accessible area of the game is located in the region between Sasau and Rattay. Other real-world settlements and towns in the game include Stříbrná Skalice, Světlá nad Sázavou, Ledečko, Sázava Monastery, Talmberk Castle, Samopše, Úžice and Nový Dvůr.\n\nBefore the events of the game, the Kingdom of Bohemia was ruled by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and it experienced a golden age under his reign. After Charles' death however, his son, Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, took up the throne instead of his half-brother, Sigismund, King of Hungary and Croatia. Wenceslaus would prove himself to be an idle, useless ruler and nuisance to the Bohemian nobility who couldn't control him. In a daring move, with the help of the Bohemian nobles, Sigismund kidnaps and dethrones Wenceslaus and begins a brutal campaign to capture the Bohemian lands.\n\nIn the silver mining town of Skalitz, young Henry is a simple peasant, living under his mother and his blacksmith father, Martin. After finishing some errands for his father, Henry joins him in completing a magnificent commissioned sword for King Wenceslaus' hetman, Sir Radzig Kobyla. While Henry wishes to explore and see life outside of the village, Martin insists that a quieter life is much safer than an adventurer's. Immediately after, an army of Cuman soldiers under Sigismund of Luxembourg's control attack and raid Skalitz, killing all who do not flee. Henry holds on to the sword and runs but later comes back for his mother and father, and witnesses their murder under Sigismund's crony, Sir Markvart von Aulitz. Henry flees to the safety of the castle, but is too late, and is forced to ride out to the nearest castle of Talmberg.\n\nBarely escaping with his life, Henry reaches Talmberg and warns its lord, Sir Divish, of the attack on Skalitz. Sir Divish takes pity on Henry after his ordeal, and later are greeted by the Skalitz survivors, led by Sir Radzig, who have snuck out during a storm. Henry is devastated by the fact his parents have not been properly buried, and sneaks out of Talmberg against Sir Divish's orders back to Skalitz. Henry swears revenge on the man who murdered his parents, but is immediately outnumbered and defeated by a group of bandits and their leader, who also takes with him the commissioned sword. Henry is rescued by another Skalitz girl, Theresa, and Talmberg's Captain Robard, who finishes burying Henry's parents and safely transports him to the town of Rattay.\n\nSeeking to get back his father's sword and avenge his parents' death, Henry meets Sir Hanush of Leipa, acting Lord of Rattay as his young nephew Lord Hans Capon's guardian, and then looks to joining Sir Radzig's envoy in aiding the battle against Sigismund's army. Although the tradition of serfdom initially keeps Henry as merely a peasant, he proves to be a courageous and dutiful soldier for Radzig. After saving and befriending Sir Hanush's bratty nephew, Lord Hans Capon, from a group of bandits, Henry is accepted into Sir Radzig's envoy. He investigates the bandits and their raids on the local farms, before eventually discovering a concealed camp that has been set up within a forested and abandoned hamlet. After warning Sir Radzig of the camp, they prepare a raid to destroy the bandit and Cuman hive. After fighting their way in, Henry confronts the sword thief and leader of the bandits, Runt. After being defeated however, Runt resigns himself to his fate and neither reveals his true leader nor the location of the sword before dying.\n\nThe hybrid group of Cumans and bandits leads the Lords to believe that someone has been secretly attempting to raise an insurgency from inside the kingdom, and Henry investigates further to discover the culprit. A lead is supplied by a clue found at the bandits' hideout; a chest of counterfeit groschen that has been made within the kingdom somewhere. Henry finds and captures the manufacturer of the counterfeits and later finds a lead on the mysterious group. Henry attempts to insert himself into their ranks, but is asked by the bandits to murder a former member of the group who has betrayed them. In order to find the target, Henry covertly joins a monastery of Christian monks where the man is hiding, and lures him out over time. Henry eventually uncovers and infiltrates the bandits' stronghold, finding a massive hidden army composed of Czech mercenary soldiers.\n\nIn the stronghold, Henry runs into Istvan Toth, a Hungarian nobleman who had been visiting the Lords prior in the game. Toth remembers Henry and reveals he also holds his father's sword. Before he can react, Henry is knocked unconscious and captured. After being beaten for hours, Henry is visited again by Toth who reveals his plan; use counterfeit groschen to assemble an army of local mercenaries under the Lords' radar, then pillage and capture the land without much resistance. With his alliance to Sigismund's cause, Toth would be granted the captured Bohemian lands once Sigismund reigns king. He goes on to also reveal that Henry is in fact the bastard son of Sir Radzig himself, and he will keep Henry alive in order to bargain for a ransom.\n\nWith the help of a former Skalitz villager Zbyshek, Henry escapes the stronghold and warns the Lords of Toth's treachery. Radzig also acknowledges Henry as his son, but keeps focus on the burgeoning situation. After recruiting Sir Divish, the Lords descend on the stronghold at night and slaughter the mass of bandits. Though they are successful, they realize Toth has fled the encampment, and that he plans to infiltrate Talmberg's castle while it is unguarded. Although they return to Talmberg as quick as possible, Toth overtakes the castle and has both Sir Divish's wife Stephanie and a captured Sir Radzig as hostages. With no other options left, the Lords prepare for a siege on Talmberg.\n\nSir Divish commands the building of a trebuchet in order to break away at the castle's walls, and Henry aids in the process by recruiting the help of eccentric military engineer Konrad Kyeser. Freeing him from his former duties at the monastery, Kyeser conducts the building of the trebuchet, allowing for the beginning of the siege. Eventually destroying the portcullis of the castle allows the gate to be opened, and the Lords begin to retake Talmberg and kill the rest of Istvan's soldiers. Though they have him cornered, Sir Hanush conducts an agreement to secure Istvan's safe departure and exile from Bohemia in exchange for Lady Stephanie. Istvan departs though with Radzig along just in case, agreeing to drop him off in Skalitz.\n\nHenry and Lord Capon ride off to pick up Radzig. Meeting him at the edges of burnt Skalitz, Henry and Radzig ponder the outcome of the situation. Henry is disheartened by the loss of his father's sword and Istvan and von Aulitz's escape from justice, though Radzig weighs that the lives saved at the end were due to the honoring of their nobility and moral principles. They return to Talmberg, to assume their next duties in restoring the kingdom.\n\nIn a dream, Henry is visited by his father Martin, who commends Henry for his courage and endurance. He sees both his father and mother disappear into the light and he awakes, in noble clothes with his new status as a lord's son.\n\nThe Lords are paid a visit by Jobst, the Margrave of Moravia, and King Wenceslaus' cousin. Together they discuss the state of Bohemia; Wenceslaus lies captive in Vienna, while Sigismund continues to plunder the kingdom. However, his homeland of Hungary has gone on to revolt against him, and he is vulnerable in choosing between staying to capture the Bohemian Crown, or return home to ensure his rule in his own domain. Jobst proposes a plan to set a strategic alliance with Sigismund's supporters, who are put off by the uprising and fear his defeat, to end the war at once. Although the Lords are uncertain of the plan, they agree to rescue and restore Wenceslaus to the throne and end Sigismund's raid peacefully.\n\nIn a final scene, Henry and Lord Capon depart on a journey to visit one of Sigismund's allies, Otto von Bergow, at his estate in Trosky Castle. With a letter stating their will to end the war at hand peacefully, Henry remarks that his personal quest remains to hunt von Aulitz and recapture his father's sword.\n\nThe project that was to become \"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" began with a pitch by Daniel Vávra, who had left 2K Czech in 2009. With a small team he began seeking investors for the project. Vávra's pitch brought on board Martin Klíma, founder of Altar Games, but pitches to major investors in the Czech Republic were not successful. The team was preparing to abandon the project when a successful pitch to a private investor, the Czech billionaire Zdeněk Bakala, secured funding to develop a prototype of the game. Warhorse Studios was founded on 21 July 2011.\n\nWarhorse Studios first announced that they were working on an \"unannounced role-playing game\" on 9 February 2012, having successfully licensed CryEngine 3 on this date. After seventeen months working on the prototype, Warhorse began a tour pitching the prototype to various international investors. The project did not generate the hype they had hoped for and with dwindling resources, little progress had been made towards an investment.\n\nOn 22 January 2014, Warhorse Studios launched a crowdfunding campaign via Kickstarter with the goal of generating , ten percent of the budget, in order to prove to the investor that there exists an audience and desire for their game. On 20 February 2014, the fund was completed, raising a total of . Even after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, the crowd funding was continued through the studios' website. On 1 October 2014, Daniel Vávra had announced through a YouTube video that the game had raised from a total of 38,784 backers. The date of the public alpha access launch was on 22 October 2014. The beta was released for backers on 3 March 2015. On 29 September 2016, it was announced that Warhorse Studios had signed a deal with Koch Media's game publishing division Deep Silver to publish the console versions, as well as the retail PC version. The game's Adaptive Music soundtrack was composed by Jan Valta and Adam Sporka, and its parts were recorded with a symphonic orchestra in Rudolfinum.\n\nThe game was released worldwide on 13 February 2018. A day-one patch was released with an extensive update of the game code and gameplay.\n\nIn the Forbes Magazine in the Czech Republic, Daniel Vávra interview stated the game cost them 750 million crowns, approximately $36.5 million USD, including marketing costs.\n\nOn 27 May 2018 developers revealed DLC roadmap. From the Ashes is the first one, and it'll grant the player control over an abandoned village that needs to be rebuilt. Two more story DLCs—The Amorous Adventures of Bold Sir Hans Capon and Band of Bastards—are due before the end of 2018. Another new content includes combat tournaments, \"making of\" documentary and \"Combat Academy\" videos. The fourth story DLC, A Woman's Lot, will arrive early 2019, as will modding support. A Woman's Lot will be free expansion for early crowdfunding supporters.\n\n\"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics for the PC version, while the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\n\"EGM\" criticized the game's difficult to use save system, long loading times, and frequency of software bugs in the game, complaining that they had logged 30 hours of real-time play, but had only advanced the game around 19 hours because of this, concluding that \"What could have been an intriguing, unique, if somewhat underwhelming RPG is completely crippled by a terrible save system and game-breaking bugs.\" \"Game Informer\" similarly criticized the save system and software bugs, concluding that \"If the historical setting and focus on realism appeal to you, then the deep gameplay systems and methodical pace are worth learning. ...however, the countless technical issues \"Kingdom Come\" requires you to suffer...until the developer brews up a comprehensive salve of patches and polish, you should avoid Henry's adventure like the plague.\"\n\n\"Game Revolution\" was more positive of the experience, describing the game as \"if you stripped \"Skyrim\" of the fantastical creatures and magic\", and concluding that \"it made for good enough of an experience to warrant enduring the game's bugs and shortfalls.\" \"GameSpot\" identified the game's attention to small detail as both a positive and negative point in the game, praising the \"Incredible attention to historical detail\" and \"Extensive, lifelike quests\", but criticizing \"Overly rigorous core mechanics can get in the way of your enjoyment\". Digitally Downloaded appreciated the game's attention to detail, but criticized the game's \"juvenile\" tone the game took in some of its traits, such as \"manly odor\" being a stat booster, receiving an alpha male stat boost by visiting a brothel,\nor needing to consume alcoholic drinks in order to save progress.\n\nOutlets such as \"Kotaku\" noted that there seemed to be more glitches and software bugs on the Xbox version of the game, and that the update patches were solving less of the errors than they were on other platforms.\n\nThe game reached a peak concurrent player count on Steam of 95,863 players at once, surpassing and which recorded 92,268 and 90,780 all-time peak players respectively.\n\nSome publications and websites accused the developers of whitewashing for not portraying people of color in the game and for its portrayal of Cumans and Hungarians as cruel invaders. The developers responded by claiming that the game is historically accurate and that people of color did not inhabit early 15th-century Bohemia in significant numbers.\n\nEuropean media responded to some aspects of the criticism. A commentator at the Czech newspaper Lidové noviny called the accusations \"out of place\" and claimed that most Europeans would respond that there were very few, if any, black people in early 15th-century central Bohemia. To evaluate if non-white people lived in 15th-century Bohemia, the German magazine M! Games asked the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. According to them, there were at most Turkic peoples, like Cumans (who appear in the game as enemies), but otherwise the presence of non-whites is \"questionable\". \n\nSome of these publications also reproached the views held by the game's director Daniel Vávra, who has been a vocal critic of what he believes is a progressive bias in video games journalism. Vávra associates his views on video game journalism with Gamergate. Daniel Vávra and Martin Klima responded to the accusations in an interview, stating that Vávra might be a little \"quick with words\", apologizing for anyone who felt offended. \"Heavy.com\" called the timing of Vávra's response \"a little...suspect\", as it was posted about a month before the game's release.\n\nOn release day, the game topped the Steam top-sellers list. Game director Daniel Vávra stated that the game sold 500,000 copies during its first two days, of which 300,000 were on Steam. Within two weeks of release, the game sold over a million copies in total across all platforms.\n\nBefore release, the game was nominated at the 2017 Game Critics Awards and Gamescom events for \"Best RPG\", winning the award for \"Best PC Game\" at the latter. In 2018, the game was also nominated for \"PC Game of the Year\" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards. The authors of the soundtrack received \"Special Achievement in Multimedia Award\" at the 2nd International Festival of Film Music and Multimedia Soundtrack Poděbrady. The game was nominated at the 1st Central & Eastern European Game Awards for \"Best Game\" and \"Technology\", winning the award for \"Narrative\".\n"}

{"id": "53653272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53653272", "title": "Russian puppet theater", "text": "Russian puppet theater\n\nRussian puppet theater appears to have originated either in migrations from the Byzantine Empire in the sixth century or possibly by Mongols travelling from China. Itinerant Slavic minstrels were presenting puppet shows in western Russia by the thirteenth century, arriving in Moscow in the mid-sixteenth century. Although Russian traditions were increasingly influenced by puppeteers from western Europe in the eighteenth century, Petrushka continued to be one of the principal figures. In addition to glove puppets and marionettes, rod puppets and flat puppets were introduced for a time but disappeared in the late nineteenth century.\n\nToday's puppet theaters owe much of their popularity to Nina Simonovich-Efimova and her husband who received support from the Russian authorities shortly after the October Revolution to set up a puppet theater in Moscow. They introduced a number of innovative designs and presented a range of performances for both children and adults. Sergey Obraztsov, who performed classical folk tales with glove puppets and marionettes, established his own theater in 1938. Puppet performances became increasingly widespread during the Soviet era and have remained popular ever since.\n\nThe origin of Russian puppetry is far from clear. It is often attributed to Italy, because of similarities between Petrushka and Pulcinella. Other theorists believe that their puppet theaters might have migrated from Byzantium into the East Slavic regions known as Kievan Rus' or that the Mongols could have brought the approach from China. Puppet theater had been popular in the west by the twelfth century and evidence indicates that it had begun to flourish as early as the sixth century in the Byzantine Empire. Because of the nature of itinerant performers, many cultural traditions may well have been influenced by foreign interaction. Ancient Slavic customs to celebrate solstice cycles show that there was a tradition of using masks and manikins in ceremonies to mark the end of one season and the beginning of another. In one such ceremony for Kupala Night, male dolls, called \"Kupalo\", and female dolls, called \"Marena\", are made of straw. The female dolls are repeatedly kidnapped forcing the women to renew their supply, until in the back and forth tug-of-war, the dolls are torn asunder and scattered.\nBetween the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, the word used for theater in Russia was \"pozorishche\", which was a distinct term from \"igrishche\", a dramatic performance including live actors. \"Kukla\", the modern Russian term for puppet theater, was first used in 1699. Itinerant minsrels known as skomorokhs were the original puppeteers in Russia and by the thirteenth century had relocated from Kievan Rus' to Novgorod. By the mid-sixteenth century, they shifted their activity to Moscow when Ivan IV ordered them to be taken there with their performing bears. By the 1630s, puppets had become an integral part of the performances of the minstrels, including an innovative means of creating a stage with blankets tied at the waist and lifted over their heads with poles so that their hands were free to move their puppets. In 1648, the \"skomorokhi\" were barred from further performances by a law that sought to wipe out superstition in the interests of Russian morality. From then on, puppets and traditions were increasingly imported from Germany and Denmark. By the mid-eighteenth century, regular performances by French, German, and Italian puppetry companies were also common in Russia.\n\nSurviving playbills from the period show that by the 1730s, Petrushka had largely been replaced by Western heroes, though the twenty-three plays in which he was still featured show that he had certainly not been forgotten and had been largely unaffected by foreign influences. By the eighteenth century, rod puppets were regularly seen performing in booths. The tradition arose in Russia and in surrounding countries including Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine when Nativity performances were banned from being held in churches. As the portable mangers were set up in more secular settings, the performances themselves also became less religious.\nIvan Finogenovich Zaitsev was one of the nineteenth-century Russian puppeteers who worked with flat puppets cut from metal. These appeared on the stage through slots cut into the table and performed scenes of the Turko-Russian wars or comedies. One of his contemporaries, Jocovlevich Siezova, made similar puppets of wood, but performances with such puppets died out in the late nineteenth century. A 1908 parody of \"The Blue Bird\" which had been produced at the Moscow Art Theater was performed with puppets by Stanislavsky at the cabaret \"The Bat\"; Andrei Belyi and Nikolai Evreinov both failed in their attempts to stage puppet theaters; and two women, and Liubov Shaporina, created dolls but were unable to achieve success with their marionette theater in the pre-revolutionary period.\n\nIn 1916, when Nina Simonovich-Efimova performed for the Moscow Fellowship of Artists, there were few practicing the art. That same year, Yulia Slonimskaya Sazonova created a marionette performance called \"The Forces of Love and Magic\" with opulent costuming, orchestration and staging, which garnered note. Shaporina began sketching scenes and costumes for a puppet theater which she successfully launched in 1918 in Petrograd.\n\nBoth Slonimskaia and Efimova worked not only to elevate the art of puppetry but wrote theatrical theories about puppets, their application, design and development. By 1918, Efimova and her husband, Ivan Efimov, a sculptor, had been asked to set up a children’s theater in line with the government's socialist restructuring policy, becoming the first professional puppetmasters in Russia, earning themselves the title of the Adam and Eve of Russian puppetry. Taking their hand puppet show on the road, the Efimovs sole means of support for six years was earned from their theater. Through the course of her career, Efimova, who was the driving force behind the puppets, patented innovative designs for shadow plays using silhouettes, rod puppets as well as life-sized manikins, in her attempts \"to establish puppetry’s validity as a unique discipline\". Slonimskaia's work focused mainly on marionettes, which she later took to France, Portugal and the United States.\nBy 1924, politically-motivated theaters had spring up in several locations, such as the Petrushka Theater, founded by in Saint Petersburg. That theater merged with the Petrograd Marionette Theatre and was later renamed the Leningrad Puppet Theatre. In 1929, the Children’s Theatre Book opened and in 1931, the Bolshoi Puppet Theatre opened in Leningrad. By the 1930s, state regulations required that all performances, i.e. circuses, variety shows, music performances and puppet theaters be controlled by GOMETs, the State Department created specifically for their regulation. One of the measures GOMETs put in place was that performances must be held in established theater venues and could no longer be itinerant street performances. Sergey Obraztsov gave his first solo performance as a puppeteer in 1923, but worked mainly as a stage actor until 1931, when he was approached by the managers of the Central Children’s Art Studio to form a puppet theater. Becoming the art director of the Central State Puppet Theatre, Obraztsov staged parody-plays with themes geared toward both adults and children. He performed with both glove puppets and marionettes, traveling in and around Moscow until 1938, when he established his own theater. After his theater was bombed during the war, he relocated to Novosibirsk until the war ended. Obraztsov characters evoked a realistic expression and performed both classic folk tales and sophisticated literary works.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, theaters spread throughout the USSR to provincial towns like Arkhangelsk, Ivanovo, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov, Rybinsk, Samara and Yaroslavl, as well as to other Soviet states. The Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic developed a strong marionette tradition and in the Khakassian Republic, a puppet theater in Abakan gained note. There was an effort made to veer toward making puppets more humanistic and away from their folk art roots, which led away from use of marionettes and focus almost exclusively on glove or rod puppets. In 1959, the Leningrad Institute for Music, Film, and Theater created a puppet department, formalizing state training for puppetmasters. During the policy reforms in the Gorbachev era, experimentation began with puppeteers appearing on-stage with their manikins and even with actors portraying puppet characters. Revaz Gabriadze was one of the most widely known puppeteers from the end of the Soviet era.\n\nIn 2000 the Museum of Architecture in Moscow held an exhibition of puppets made by prominent performers to show variations in design and artistry associated with manikins. Puppet theater without the constraint of realism, has returned to its earlier roots. Marionettes have seen a re-emergence and a range of performance approaches, once again including shadow plays, and traditional puppet movement, are employed. Theater has moved away from both a venue solely for children and often features texts written, rather than adapted from other works, specifically for puppet performances.\n\nSome of the most noted theaters include: The puppet Theater of Ekaterinburg is renowned for employing some of the best known puppet designers in Russia. The Khakassian Puppet Theater Fairy Tale in Abakan is noted for its wooden manikins which perform typically biblical themes. The Arkhangelsk Puppet Theater tends to focus on cultural tradition, while the Theater Potudan in Saint Petersburg and the Theater Ten' are known as innovative venues. When Theater Potudan opened, in 2002 its repertoire centered around the Andrei Platonov novella, \"The River Potudan\". It was expanded later that year to include an adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's story \"Nevsky Prospekt\". The performances are for an adult audience and explore universal life themes. Theater Ten' recreates intricate shadow plays parodying performances at the Bolshoi Theater. It also hosts events where performers introduce children to theatrical performance, explaining the nuances of various genres.\n\n\n"}

The soft count rooms are usually among the most secure places due to the large amounts of cash that can be on hand at any one time.\n\nTraditionally, a count room would be operated by at least three people. The first two people independently counted stacks of currency and recorded the results on a count card. The third person examined the two count cards to ensure that the first two people recorded the same amount. If there was a difference between the amounts recorded on the two count cards, the currency would be recounted. Some smaller volume cash businesses still operate a count room in this fashion.\n\nThe counting is currently done by accounting professionals called soft counters, usually using computer spreadsheets. \n\nTypically, a soft count room contains a large table upon which the currency to be counted is placed, known as the \"count table\". Count room personnel manually organize the currency so that it can be easily counted by hand or by a counting machine.\n\nMost modern count rooms are equipped with high-speed computerized machines that perform the counting process. Typically, these machines are capable of counting between ten and twenty banknotes per second. After currency is prepared on the count table, it is transferred to the machine's operator, who inserts the prepared stacks into the machine. The machine authenticates each banknote, separates the counted banknotes according to denomination, and provides a printed or electronic report of the results.\n\nThe opposite of soft count is hard count in which coins and chips are counted.\n"}

She is the younger sister of central character Blanche DuBois and wife of Stanley Kowalski.\n\nThe play begins when Blanche comes to visit Stella and Stanley in New Orleans after having lost their family home, Belle Reve, and her job as a teacher in Laurel, Mississippi. We gather that Stella was a Southern belle who left her home town to find work after her family fell on hard times. In New Orleans, she met her soon-to-be husband, Stanley Kowalski, who has just returned from World War II, complete with decorations. Stella is portrayed as sensual and declining to the will of her husband. \n\nStanley is prone to fits of rage in which he throws things and hits Stella. She often finds herself taking refuge at her neighbor Eunice’s home, only to return to Stanley when he cries for her to take him back. It is clear in the play that Stella is attracted to Stanley's passionate, animal nature, and that is why she stays with him. Williams neither condemns nor condones this sort of love; it is the way Stella yields to her marriage. Blanche, who has arrived for a \"visit,\" is horrified by her sister's situation and tries to convince Stella to divorce Stanley. Stella refuses, however, bound to Stanley by sexual attraction and her pregnancy with his child.\n\nStanley, who prides himself on luring Stella away from her privileged background, dislikes the influence Blanche has over his young wife. When Stanley discovers that Blanche has lost the family estate and been forced out of her home town for promiscuity, he gleefully tells Stella, who initially refuses to believe him.\n\nThe night Stella goes into labor, Stanley drunkenly happens upon Blanche and rapes her. This sends Blanche completely over the edge into a nervous breakdown. From what she says in the final scene, it is clear that Stella has chosen to believe that Blanche is lying about the rape. She acquiesces to his plan to send Blanche off to a mental institution. However, in the film adaptation, it is shown that Stella leaves him and takes their child (though it is ambiguous if she goes back to him).\n\nStella was portrayed by Kim Hunter in the Broadway production as well as the 1951 film adaptation. Hunter won an Academy Award for her performance.\n\nIn the 1984 TV movie she was portrayed by Beverly D'Angelo and in the 1995 TV movie she was portrayed by Diane Lane.\n\nIn the 1951 film adaptation of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", there is a suggestion that Stella may leave Stanley after she finds out about the rape.\n"}
{"id": "8737153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8737153", "title": "Tamasha", "text": "Tamasha\n\nTamasha () is a traditional form of Marathi theatre, often with singing and dancing, widely performed by local or travelling theatre groups within the state of Maharashtra, India. It has also been the subject of several Marathi films. Some Hindi movies have also included Tamasha-themed songs, known as Lavanis, in the past.\n\nTraditional Tamasha is influenced by many Indian art forms and draws from such diverse traditions as kaveli, ghazals, Kathak dance, dashavatara, lalit and kirtan. There are two types of Tamasha: \"dholki bhaari\" and the older form, \"sangeet baari\" which contains more dance and music than drama. In Maharashtra, the Kolhati groups are traditionally associated with the performance of Tamasha.\n\nThe word \"Tamasha\" is originally from Persian, meaning a show or theatrical entertainment of some kind. The word has spread to Armenian, Hindi, Urdu and Marathi, to mean \"fun\" or \"play\". In Armenian language \"To do Tamasha\" means \"To follow an interesting process or entertainment\". Colloquially the word has come to represent commotion, or any activity or display with bustle and excitement, sometimes in the sense of \"a tempest in a teacup\".\n\nThe region of Maharashtra, has had a long theatrical tradition, one of the early references was found in the cave inscriptions at Nashik by Gautami Balashri, the mother of the 1st-century Satavahana ruler, Gautamiputra Satakarni. The inscription mentions him organizing Utsava and Samaja, forms of theatrical entertainment for his subjects.\n\nTamasha acquired a distinct form in late Peshwa period of Maratha Empire, in the 18th century, and incorporated elements of older traditional forms like Dasavatar, Gondhal, Kirtan, and Waghya-murali, part of Khandoba Bhakti Geet, amongst worshippers of the local god Khandoba.\n\nIn Maharashtra, there are two types of Tamasha, first is \"dholaki fadcha\" Tamasha and the other is \"sangeet baaricha\" Tamasha. Dholaki Fadcha tamasha is complete art, which includes song, dance, and theater. Now in Maharashtra there are only 18 to 20 full-time tamasha parties. Each tamasha mandal performs approximately 210 days in all over Maharashtra and also some border villages of Karnataka and Gujarat.\n\nTraditional Tamasha format consisted of dancing-boys known as \"Nachya\", who also played women's roles, a poet-composer known as \"Shahir\", who played the traditional role of \"Sutradhar\" or a jester known as \"Songadya\", who compered the show. However, with time, women started taking part in Tamasha. Marathi theatre made its beginning in 1843, and in the following years, Tamasha which was primarily constituted of singing and dancing expanded its thematic repertoire and added small dramatic and humorous skits, known as \"vag\", to it. These were either in prose or comprised long narrative poems performed by the Shahir along with his chorus, with actors improvising their lines. Popular Vag composers of the time were Patthe Bapurao and Dattoba Sali, and one of their noted vag, \"Gadhavache Lagna\" (Marriage of Donkey) was popularized by Tamasha artist, Dadu Idurikar. Soon, noted Marathi writers started written Vags for Tamasha troupes.\n\nAs the textile industry started developing in Mumbai (then Bombay) in the 19th century, workers migrated here from the rural areas in large numbers. Soon their theatre did too, initially rural tamasha companies were invited to the city for performances. Though later numerous local tamasha companies flourished, patronized by mill workers living in Girgaum.\n\nTraditional tamasha practitioners were from castes like Kolhati, Mahar, Mang and Bhatu from rural regions of Maharashtra, labelled low castes within the Indian caste system. Thus, in the late 19th century, religious reformers employed tamasha to castigate the caste system of the region. During the same period, Satyashodhak Samaj founded by Jyotirao Phule started organizing \"Satyashodhaki jalsa\", which used the tamasha tradition in its political and reformist theatre, which was an amalgamation of proscenium tamasha and street theatre.\n\nThe rise of modern Marathi theatre movement in the post-independence era, which was largely \"literary drama\" from with a Westernized idiom, tamasha like other prevalent indigenous theatre forms, like \"jatra\" in Bengal and \"bhavai\" in Gujarat, was also deemed \"debased\", even \"corrupt\", while being relegated to being only \"folk\" form. The turning away of urban middle class audience from traditional forms, cause a disruption in the theatrical traditions besides creating a divide between urban and rural theatre, as tamasha continued to flourish out the urban pockets.\n\nIn 2002, the state had 450 tamasha troupes with approximately 10,000 artistes.\n\nMain elements of tamasha, like loud humour, suggestive lyrics and dance numbers, proved influential in the development the Bollywood idiom, which is based in Mumbai. Even today, the mainstream cinema or Masala films, complete with their suggestive dance numbers, now known as item number, and humour sequences remain largely entertainment oriented.\n\nOver the years, some modern theatre practitioners have incorporated the traditional forms like tamasha and dashavatar into their plays. In the 1970s, during the rise of modernMarathi theatre, the tamasha form was employed as narrative device and style in several notable plays like \"Ghashiram Kotwal\" by Vijay Tendulkar, Vijaya Mehta's Marathi adaptations of Bertolt Brecht's \"The Good Woman of Setzuan\" as \"Devajine Karuna Keli\" (1972) and \"Caucasian Chalk Circle\" as \"Ajab Nyaya Vartulacha\" (1974), P. L. Deshpande's \"Teen paishacha Tamasha\" (1978), an adaptation of Brecht's \"The Threepenny Opera\".\n\nThe 1972, Marathi hit film, \"Pinjra\" directed by V. Shantaram, starring Shriram Lagoo and Sandhya in lead roles was set in the Tamasha musical theatre. Besides this other Marathi films made of Tamasha include, \"Sangte Aika\" (1959) directed by Anand Mane and starring Jayshree Gadkar, \"Sawaal Majha Aika!\" (1964) by Anant Mane and starring Jayshree Gadkar, \"Ek Hota Vidushak\" (1992) by Jabbar Patel, \"Natarang\" (2010) by Ravi Jadhav and \"Tamasha - Hach Khel Udya Punha\" (2011) by Milind Pednekar.\n\nA 2006 multilingual documentary film, \"Silent Ghungroos\", traces the origins of Tamasha in the Peshwa period to its contemporary form, where the form competes with modern entertainment mediums.\n\nThe word \"tamasha\" has been used in book and plays titles, including, Jaipur Tamasha, and theatre company, Tamasha Theatre Company.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its German title is \"Maria Schweidler, die Bernsteinhexe\". The novel was originally published as a literary hoax which purported to be an actual 17th-century chronicle. Meinhold later admitted to the hoax but had some difficulty in proving that he was its author. In 1844, it was published in Britain as \"The Amber Witch\" in two English translations: one by E. A. Friedlander and another, more enduring, translation by Lucie, Lady Duff-Gordon.\n\nLady Duff Gordon's translation was very popular with the Victorians and went through numerous editions, including a luxurious one in 1895 illustrated by Philip Burne-Jones. The novel was a favourite of Oscar Wilde's when he was a boy, and in 1861 it was made into an opera, \"The Amber Witch\", composed by William Vincent Wallace. Wallace's opera has faded into obscurity, but the novel on which it was based has continued to be republished, both on its own and in anthologies.\n\nMeinhold claimed to have discovered a manuscript written by a 17th-century minister, Abraham Schweidler (purportedly a pastor of Coserow and known for his fire and brimstone sermons) amongst rubbish in the choir of the old Coserow church. The manuscript contained the story of the pastor's daughter Maria, the \"Amber Witch\".\n\nThe tale was described by Meinhold, in the subtitle of the novel, as \"the most interesting trial for witchcraft ever known\". When it first appeared, almost all of the German critics believed it was an authentic historical document. \nThe work attracted critical notice, not only for the dramatic nature of its narrative but also for disputes about which parts of it were original and which were Meinhold's reconstructions, written in imitation of the 17th-century style.\n\nMeinhold's intention was to set a trap for the disciples of David Strauss and his school, who pronounced the Bible to be a collection of legends from historical research assisted by internal evidence. In a direct challenge to these \"modern documentary critics\", Meinhold wrote in his preface to \"The Amber Witch\":\n\nOnly in a later edition did the author admit that the tale was entirely imaginary. His admission that it was a hoax was at first rejected but was soon accepted as the truth. As \"The Times\" wrote in the late 1840s:\n\nThe hoax was done with great skill and attention to detail, using language that would have been used in 17th-century Germany.\nWriter Seabury Quinn wrote an article in the August 1925 issue of \"Weird Tales\" in which, unaware of the hoax, he recounted the plot of \"The Amber Witch\" as if it were an actual historical event.\n\nThe story is set during the Thirty Years' War. The purported author, Reverend Abraham Schweidler, almost loses his only child, Maria, to a plot by a rejected suitor, Sheriff Appelmann, who has accused Maria of practicing witchcraft. In this he was aided by an evil and jealous woman of the neighborhood.\n\nAfter a trial and under threat of the most dire torture, Maria, wholly innocent of the crime, confesses. While on her way to the stake, she is rescued by a courageous young nobleman who loves her and who exposes the evil plot against her.\n\n\n"}

Buffy goes to check on Spike, who's chained in the basement. They chat about the girls being gone and Spike's decision to stay chained up until they know the First Evil is through with him. Suddenly, Spike begins to writhe in pain as his chip fires without provocation.\n\nBuffy talks with Willow in the kitchen about Spike's chip and what little they actually know about it. Willow then goes upstairs to bring Kennedy some tea. When Willow walks into the room, she finds that Kennedy is not actually sick, and is instead dressed for a \"mission\" which she says requires Willow's assistance. The mission turns out to be drinks at The Bronze. Back in the basement, Buffy checks on Spike again and they talk about the potential causes of the chip's glitches. Buffy realizes that she is going to have to contact the people who implanted the chip in the first place: The Initiative. Buffy tries, but fails, to reach Riley Finn on the telephone; Spike's chip continues to fire at random intervals.\n\nWillow and Kennedy finish their drinks and then return to Revello Drive. Back in their room, Kennedy gives Willow an end-of-date kiss, with a surprising effect: Willow takes on the appearance of Warren Mears. Panicking, Willow rushes downstairs; on seeing her, the others recoil, partly because they know that the First Evil has appeared to Andrew as Warren. Buffy hits \"Warren\", showing that \"he\" cannot be the First (who is incorporeal). When Willow threatens to tell some embarrassing old stories about Xander, the gang provisionally accept her claim.\n\nWillow goes off to try to break the spell; Kennedy tags along. Spike's chip fires again. Buffy and Spike go to the Initiative's abandoned base to look for the painkilling drugs that were used on Spike during his captivity there three years before, when the chip was implanted, and for documentation on the chip.\n\nRobson, a Watcher, telephones Buffy's house from England and reports that Giles may have been killed by a Bringer (as seen in the ending of \"Sleeper\"). The Scoobies become alarmed when none of them can remember seeing Giles touch anything since his return; no one has hugged him, nor seen him carry anything, and he is not driving the car to the desert. Xander, Anya, Dawn, and Andrew all go to the desert to find Giles and, in the case of danger, stop him from hurting the Potentials.\n\nWillow and Kennedy go to meet with the Wiccan group at the University of California-Sunnydale, which now includes Amy. Willow tries to run away as she realizes she's not just looking like Warren, she's becoming him. Kennedy tries to follow, but Willow puts up a magical barrier to keep her away. Buffy and Spike wander through the remains of the Initiative, finding many dead soldiers and demons (\"Primeval\").\n\nInside the Initiative, Buffy and Spike are attacked by a demon. During the fray, Buffy is wounded by the demon and when Spike tries to help, his chip fires and renders him ineffectual. The demon grabs Spike and drags him off into the darkness. Kennedy returns to the lecture hall to find Amy packing up supplies; the rest of the group is gone. Amy comments on Kennedy's concern for Willow, and draws Kennedy's suspicion when she mentions that Kennedy is a Potential, a fact that neither Kennedy or Willow had mentioned.\n\nWillow, increasingly dominated by the Warren persona, goes to buy a gun, of the same model that killed Tara and wounded Buffy (\"Seeing Red\"). Out in the desert, Giles is tackled to the ground by Xander and the others. They are all pleased to find that he has a solid form and thus is not the First Evil – nor dead.\n\nBack at the abandoned Initiative facility, Buffy battles with and finally kills the demon that attacked her and Spike. As she crouches down by Spike to see if he is okay, lights turn on, revealing a group of soldiers. Their leader explains that Riley received Buffy's message, and they are there to help Spike. An examination confirms that Spike's chip is killing him. It is up to Buffy to decide whether to repair the chip or remove it.\n\nKennedy confronts Amy, accusing her of causing the \"Warren\" problem. Amy reveals that she put a hex on Willow, whose effect is determined by the victim's subconscious. She did it because Willow murdered a man and remained beloved – crowning Amy's envy of Willow's relatively easy successes in magic. Amy then teleports Kennedy to the backyard of Buffy's house, where Willow/Warren starts to reenact his attack on Buffy that resulted in Tara's death, but Kennedy talks Willow down. Willow tearfully explains that when Kennedy kissed her she let go of Tara's memory for a moment, making her truly dead. When Kennedy kisses Willow again, and the spell ends. The two go into the house together.\n\nEach scene with Willow/Warren was filmed twice - once with Alyson Hannigan playing Willow and again with Adam Busch as Warren. Which actor performed the scene first depended upon how \"Willow\" Warren was supposed to be. That is, when Willow first changes into Warren she acts more or less like Willow; in these early scenes Hannigan would act first so that Busch could somewhat mimic her performance. In later scenes when Warren's personality is more prominent Busch would act first. Because of this decision to use both actors, filming the Willow scenes took much longer than usual.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Elizabeth Anne Allen says, \"everything had to be so exact.\" She explains that if Alyson or Adam \"gestured or moved their head differently from the other person, they had to do the take over again. So that one scene took us a day and a half to shoot.\"\nAnthony Stewart Head was not allowed to touch anything while onscreen for several episodes prior to this one, in order to set up the suspicion that Giles might actually be the First. According to the DVD commentary for this episode, this was apparently quite a pain for all involved. When asked why he set up this misdirection, Joss Whedon says it was \"to make people wonder. Just to have a little fun in the sense of pulling a mystery... an exercise, something to spice things up.\" Whedon wanted to play off the \"creepy\" idea that \"we don't know where the bad guy is, we don't know where he's coming from. Our trusted mentor could be the bad guy.\"\nIn the DVD commentary, director David Solomon notes that Iyari Limon had to do a lot of kissing in this episode. He says she joked that her lips hurt after having to do long kisses with both Alyson Hannigan and Adam Busch.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "97275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97275", "title": "Victoria and Albert Museum", "text": "Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum (often abbreviated as the V&A) in London is the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design, housing a permanent collection of over 2.27 million objects. It was founded in 1852 and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.\n\nThe V&A is located in the Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area that has become known as \"Albertopolis\" because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial and the major cultural institutions with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Royal Albert Hall and Imperial College London. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Like other national British museums, entrance to the museum has been free since 2001.\n\nThe V&A covers and 145 galleries. Its collection spans 5,000 years of art, from ancient times to the present day, from the cultures of Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa. The holdings of ceramics, glass, textiles, costumes, silver, ironwork, jewellery, furniture, medieval objects, sculpture, prints and printmaking, drawings and photographs are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world. \n\nThe museum owns the world's largest collection of post-classical sculpture, with the holdings of Italian Renaissance items being the largest outside Italy. The departments of Asia include art from South Asia, China, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The East Asian collections are among the best in Europe, with particular strengths in ceramics and metalwork, while the Islamic collection is amongst the largest in the Western world. Overall, it is one of the largest museums in the world.\n\nSince 2001, the museum has embarked on a major £150m renovation programme, which has seen a major overhaul of the departments, including the introduction of newer galleries, gardens, shops and visitor facilities.\n\nNew 17th- and 18th-century European galleries were opened on 9 December 2015. These restored the original Aston Webb interiors and host the European collections 1600–1815.\n\nThe V&A has its origins in the Great Exhibition of 1851, with which Henry Cole, the museum's first director, was involved in planning; initially it was known as the Museum of Manufactures, first opening in May 1852 at Marlborough House, but by September had been transferred to Somerset House. At this stage the collections covered both applied art and science. Several of the exhibits from the Exhibition were purchased to form the nucleus of the collection. By February 1854 discussions were underway to transfer the museum to the current site and it was renamed South Kensington Museum. In 1855 the German architect Gottfried Semper, at the request of Cole, produced a design for the museum, but it was rejected by the Board of Trade as too expensive. The site was occupied by Brompton Park House; this was extended including the first refreshment rooms opened in 1857, the museum being the first in the world to provide such a facility.\n\nThe official opening by Queen Victoria was on 20 June 1857. In the following year, late night openings were introduced, made possible by the use of gas lighting. This was to enable in the words of Cole \"to ascertain practically what hours are most convenient to the working classes\"—this was linked to the use of the collections of both applied art and science as educational resources to help boost productive industry. In these early years the practical use of the collection was very much emphasised as opposed to that of \"High Art\" at the National Gallery and scholarship at the British Museum. George Wallis (1811–1891), the first Keeper of Fine Art Collection, passionately promoted the idea of wide art education through the museum collections. This led to the transfer to the museum of the School of Design that had been founded in 1837 at Somerset House; after the transfer it was referred to as the Art School or Art Training School, later to become the Royal College of Art which finally achieved full independence in 1949. From the 1860s to the 1880s the scientific collections had been moved from the main museum site to various improvised galleries to the west of Exhibition Road. In 1893 the \"Science Museum\" had effectively come into existence when a separate director was appointed.\n\nThe laying of the foundation stone of the Aston Webb building (to the left of the main entrance) on 17 May 1899 was the last official public appearance by Queen Victoria. It was during this ceremony that the change of name from the South Kensington Museum to the Victoria and Albert Museum was made public. Queen Victoria's address during the ceremony, as recorded in the London Gazette, ended: \"I trust that it will remain for ages a Monument of discerning Liberality and a Source of Refinement and Progress.\"\n\nThe exhibition which the museum organised to celebrate the centennial of the 1899 renaming, \"A Grand Design\", first toured in North America from 1997 (Baltimore Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco), returning to London in 1999. To accompany and support the exhibition, the museum published a book, \"Grand Design,\" which it has made available for reading online on its website.\n\nThe opening ceremony for the Aston Webb building by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra took place on 26 June 1909. In 1914 the construction commenced of the Science Museum, signalling the final split of the science and art collections.\n\nIn 1939 on the outbreak of World War II, most of the collection was sent to a quarry in Wiltshire, to Montacute House in Somerset, or to a tunnel near Aldwych tube station, with larger items remaining in situ, sand-bagged and bricked in. Between 1941 and 1944 some galleries were used as a school for children evacuated from Gibraltar. The South Court became a canteen, first for the Royal Air Force and later for Bomb Damage Repair Squads.\n\nBefore the return of the collections after the war, the \"Britain Can Make It\" exhibition was held between September and November 1946, attracting nearly a million and a half visitors. This was organised by the Council of Industrial Design established by the British government in 1944 \"to promote by all practicable means the improvement of design in the products of British industry\". The success of this exhibition led to the planning of the Festival of Britain (1951). By 1948 most of the collections had been returned to the museum.\n\nIn July 1973, as part of its outreach programme to young people, the V&A became the first museum in Britain to present a rock concert. The V&A presented a combined concert/lecture by British progressive folk-rock band Gryphon, who explored the lineage of mediaeval music and instrumentation and related how those contributed to contemporary music 500 years later. This innovative approach to bringing young people to museums was a hallmark of the directorship of Roy Strong and was subsequently emulated by some other British museums.\n\nIn the 1980s, Sir Roy Strong renamed the museum as \"The Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Museum of Art and Design\". Strong's successor Elizabeth Esteve-Coll oversaw a turbulent period for the institution in which the museum's curatorial departments were re-structured, leading to public criticism from some staff. Esteve-Coll's attempts to make the V&A more accessible included a criticised marketing campaign emphasising the café over the collection.\n\nIn 2001, \"FuturePlan\" was launched, which involves redesigning all the galleries and public facilities in the museum that have yet to be remodelled. This is to ensure that the exhibits are better displayed, more information is available and the museum meets modern expectations for museum facilities; it should take about ten years to complete the work. A new entrance, courtyard and gallery designed by Amanda Levete's AL A was scheduled for opening in 2017.\n\nThe museum also runs the Museum of Childhood at Bethnal Green and used to run the Theatre Museum in Covent Garden and Apsley House. The Theatre Museum is now closed and the V&A Theatre Collections are now displayed within the South Kensington building.\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced that the Duchess of Cambridge would become the first royal patron of the museum.\n\nThe V&A has no museums or galleries of its own outside London. Instead it works with a small number of partner organisations in Sheffield, Dundee and Blackpool to provide a regional presence.\n\nV&A Dundee opened on 15 September 2018. \n\nThe V&A was in discussion with the University of Dundee, University of Abertay, Dundee City Council and the Scottish Government with a view to opening a new £43 million gallery in Dundee that would use the V&A brand although it would be funded through and operated independently. As of 2015, with costs estimated at £76 million, it is the most expensive gallery project ever undertaken in Scotland. The V&A Dundee will be on the city's waterfront and is intended to focus on fashion, architecture, product design, graphic arts and photography. It is scheduled to open on 15 September 2018. Dundee City Council was expected to pay a major part of the running costs. The V&A was not contributing financially, but would be providing expertise, loans and exhibitions.\n\nPlans for a new gallery in Blackpool are also under consideration. This follows earlier plans to move the theatre collection to a new £60m museum in Blackpool, which failed due to lack of funding. The V&A exhibits twice a year at the Millennium Galleries in partnership with Museums Sheffield.\n\nThe V&A is one of 17 museums across Europe and the Mediterranean participating in a project called \"Discover Islamic Art\". Developed by the Brussels-based consortium Museum With No Frontiers, this online \"virtual museum\" brings together more than 1200 works of Islamic art and architecture into a single database.\n\nVictorian parts of the building have a complex history, with piecemeal additions by different architects. Founded in May 1852, it was not until 1857 that the museum moved to its present site. This area of London was known as Brompton but had been renamed South Kensington. The land was occupied by Brompton Park House, which was extended, most notably by the \"Brompton Boilers\", which were starkly utilitarian iron galleries with a temporary look and were later dismantled and used to build the V&A Museum of Childhood. The first building to be erected that still forms part of the museum was the Sheepshanks Gallery in 1857 on the eastern side of the garden. Its architect was civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers, who was appointed by Cole. The next major expansions were designed by the same architect, the Turner and Vernon galleries built in 1858–59 to house the eponymous collections (later transferred to the Tate Gallery) and now used as the picture galleries and tapestry gallery respectively. The North and South Courts were then built, both of which opened by June 1862. They now form the galleries for temporary exhibitions and are directly behind the Sheepshanks Gallery. On the very northern edge of the site is situated the Secretariat Wing; also built in 1862, this houses the offices and board room etc. and is not open to the public.\nAn ambitious scheme of decoration was developed for these new areas: a series of mosaic figures depicting famous European artists of the Medieval and Renaissance period. These have now been removed to other areas of the museum. Also started were a series of frescoes by Lord Leighton: \"Industrial Arts as Applied to War\" 1878–1880 and \"Industrial Arts Applied to Peace\", which was started but never finished. To the east of this were additional galleries, the decoration of which was the work of another designer Owen Jones; these were the Oriental Courts (covering India, China and Japan), completed in 1863. None of this decoration survives. Part of these galleries became the new galleries covering the 19th century, opened in December 2006. The last work by Fowke was the design for the range of buildings on the north and west sides of the garden. This includes the refreshment rooms, reinstated as the Museum Café in 2006, with the silver gallery above (at the time the ceramics gallery); the top floor has a splendid lecture theatre, although this is seldom open to the general public. The ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings was designed by F. W. Moody and has architectural details of moulded and coloured pottery. All the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864–69. The style adopted for this part of the museum was Italian Renaissance; much use was made of terracotta, brick and mosaic. This north façade was intended as the main entrance to the museum, with its bronze doors, designed by James Gamble and Reuben Townroe, having six panels, depicting Humphry Davy (chemistry); Isaac Newton (astronomy); James Watt (mechanics); Bramante (architecture); Michelangelo (sculpture); and Titian (painting); The panels thus represent the range of the museum's collections. Godfrey Sykes also designed the terracotta embellishments and the mosaic in the pediment of the North Façade commemorating the Great Exhibition, the profits from which helped to fund the museum. This is flanked by terracotta statue groups by Percival Ball. This building replaced Brompton Park House, which could then be demolished to make way for the south range.\nThe interiors of the three refreshment rooms were assigned to different designers. The Green Dining Room (1866–68) was the work of Philip Webb and William Morris, and displays Elizabethan influences. The lower part of the walls are panelled in wood with a band of paintings depicting fruit and the occasional figure, with moulded plaster foliage on the main part of the wall and a plaster frieze around the decorated ceiling and stained-glass windows by Edward Burne-Jones. The Centre Refreshment Room (1865–77) was designed in a Renaissance style by James Gamble. The walls and even the Ionic columns in this room are covered in decorative and moulded ceramic tile, the ceiling consists of elaborate designs on enamelled metal sheets and matching stained-glass windows, and the marble fireplace was designed and sculpted by Alfred Stevens and was removed from Dorchester House prior to that building's demolition in 1929. The Grill Room (1876–81) was designed by Sir Edward Poynter; the lower part of its walls consist of blue and white tiles with various figures and foliage enclosed by wood panelling, while above there are large tiled scenes with figures depicting the four seasons and the twelve months, painted by ladies from the Art School then based in the museum. The windows are also stained glass; there is an elaborate cast-iron grill still in place.\n\nWith the death of Captain Francis Fowke of the Royal Engineers, the next architect to work at the museum was Colonel (later Major General) Henry Young Darracott Scott, also of the Royal Engineers. He designed to the north west of the garden the five-storey School for Naval Architects (also known as the science schools), now the Henry Cole Wing, in 1867–72. Scott's assistant J. W. Wild designed the impressive staircase that rises the full height of the building. Made from Cadeby stone, the steps are in length, while the balustrades and columns are Portland stone. It is now used to jointly house the prints and architectural drawings of the V&A (prints, drawings, paintings and photographs) and Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA Drawings and Archives Collections), and the Sackler Centre for arts education, which opened in 2008.\n\nContinuing the style of the earlier buildings, various designers were responsible for the decoration. The terracotta embellishments were again the work of Godfrey Sykes, although sgraffito was used to decorate the east side of the building designed by F. W. Moody. A final embellishment was the wrought iron gates made as late as 1885 designed by Starkie Gardner. These lead to a passage through the building. Scott also designed the two Cast Courts (1870–73) to the southeast of the garden (the site of the \"Brompton Boilers\"); these vast spaces have ceilings in height to accommodate the plaster casts of parts of famous buildings, including Trajan's Column (in two separate pieces). The final part of the museum designed by Scott was the Art Library and what is now the sculpture gallery on the south side of the garden, built in 1877–83. The exterior mosaic panels in the parapet were designed by Reuben Townroe, who also designed the plaster work in the library. Sir John Taylor designed the book shelves and cases. This was the first part of the museum to have electric lighting. This completed the northern half of the site, creating a quadrangle with the garden at its centre, but left the museum without a proper façade. In 1890 the government launched a competition to design new buildings for the museum, with architect Alfred Waterhouse as one of the judges; this would give the museum a new imposing front entrance.\n\nThe main façade, built from red brick and Portland stone, stretches along Cromwell Gardens and was designed by Aston Webb after winning a competition in 1891 to extend the museum. Construction took place between 1899 and 1909. Stylistically it is a strange hybrid: although much of the detail belongs to the Renaissance, there are medieval influences at work. The main entrance, consisting of a series of shallow arches supported by slender columns and niches with twin doors separated by pier, is Romanesque in form but Classical in detail. Likewise the tower above the main entrance has an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame, a feature of late Gothic architecture and a feature common in Scotland, but the detail is Classical. The main windows to the galleries are also mullioned and transomed, again a Gothic feature; the top row of windows are interspersed with statues of many of the British artists whose work is displayed in the museum.\n\nPrince Albert appears within the main arch above the twin entrances, and Queen Victoria above the frame around the arches and entrance, sculpted by Alfred Drury. These façades surround four levels of galleries. Other areas designed by Webb include the Entrance Hall and Rotunda, the East and West Halls, the areas occupied by the shop and Asian Galleries, and the Costume Gallery. The interior makes much use of marble in the entrance hall and flanking staircases, although the galleries as originally designed were white with restrained classical detail and mouldings, very much in contrast to the elaborate decoration of the Victorian galleries, although much of this decoration was removed in the early 20th century.\n\nThe Museum survived the Second World War with only minor bomb damage. The worst loss was the Victorian stained glass on the Ceramics Staircase, which was blown in when bombs fell nearby; pockmarks still visible on the façade of the museum were caused by fragments from the bombs.\n\nIn the immediate post-war years there was little money available for other than essential repairs. The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600–1800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. To adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the façade.\n\nA few galleries were redesigned in the 1990s including the Indian, Japanese, Chinese, iron work, the main glass galleries, and the main silverware gallery, which was further enhanced in 2002 when some of the Victorian decoration was recreated. This included two of the ten columns having their ceramic decoration replaced and the elaborate painted designs restored on the ceiling. As part of the 2006 renovation the mosaic floors in the sculpture gallery were restored—most of the Victorian floors were covered in linoleum after the Second World War. After the success of the British Galleries, opened in 2001, it was decided to embark on a major redesign of all the galleries in the museum; this is known as \"FuturePlan\", and was created in consultation with the exhibition designers and masterplanners Metaphor. The plan is expected to take about ten years and was started in 2002. To date several galleries have been redesigned, notably, in 2002: the main Silver Gallery, Contemporary; in 2003: Photography, the main entrance, The Painting Galleries; in 2004: the tunnel to the subway leading to South Kensington tube station, new signage throughout the museum, architecture, V&A and RIBA reading rooms and stores, metalware, Members' Room, contemporary glass, and the Gilbert Bayes sculpture gallery; in 2005: portrait miniatures, prints and drawings, displays in Room 117, the garden, sacred silver and stained glass; in 2006: Central Hall Shop, Islamic Middle East, the new café, and sculpture galleries. Several designers and architects have been involved in this work. Eva Jiřičná designed the enhancements to the main entrance and rotunda, the new shop, the tunnel and the sculpture galleries. Gareth Hoskins was responsible for contemporary and architecture, Softroom, Islamic Middle East and the Members' Room, McInnes Usher McKnight Architects (MUMA) were responsible for the new Cafe and designed the new Medieval and Renaissance galleries which opened in 2009.\n\nIn September 2004, the museum's board of trustees voted to abandon a proposed extension, designed by Daniel Libeskind with Cecil Balmond, after failing to receive funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.\n\nIn 2011 the V&A announced that London-based practice AL A had won an international competition to construct a gallery beneath a new entrance courtyard on Exhibition Road. Planning for the scheme was granted in 2012.\n\nThe central garden was redesigned by Kim Wilkie and opened as the John Madejski Garden on 5 July 2005. The design is a subtle blend of the traditional and modern: the layout is formal; there is an elliptical water feature lined in stone with steps around the edge which may be drained to use the area for receptions, gatherings or exhibition purposes. This is in front of the bronze doors leading to the refreshment rooms. A central path flanked by lawns leads to the sculpture gallery. The north, east and west sides have herbaceous borders along the museum walls with paths in front which continues along the south façade. In the two corners by the north façade there is planted an American Sweetgum tree. The southern, eastern and western edges of the lawns have glass planters which contain orange and lemon trees in summer, which are replaced by bay trees in winter.\n\nAt night both the planters and water feature may be illuminated, and the surrounding façades lit to reveal details normally in shadow. Especially noticeable are the mosaics in the loggia of the north façade. In summer a café is set up in the south west corner. The garden is also used for temporary exhibits of sculpture; for example, a sculpture by Jeff Koons was shown in 2006. It has also played host to the museum's annual contemporary design showcase, the V&A Village Fete, since 2005.\n\nThe Victoria & Albert Museum is split into four Collections departments: 1) Asia; 2) Furniture, Textiles and Fashion; 3) Sculpture, Metalwork, Ceramics & Glass; and, 4) Word & Image. The museum curators care for the objects in the collection and provide access to objects that are not currently on display to the public and scholars.\n\nThe collection departments are further divided into sixteen display areas, whose combined collection numbers over 6.5 million objects, not all items are displayed or stored at the V&A. There is a repository at Blythe House, West Kensington, as well as annexe institutions managed by the V&A, also the Museum lends exhibits to other institutions. The following lists each of the collections on display and the number of objects within the collection.\n\nThe museum has 145 galleries, but given the vast extent of the collections only a small percentage is ever on display. Many acquisitions have been made possible only with the assistance of the National Art Collections Fund.\n\nIn 2004, the V&A alongside Royal Institute of British Architects opened the first permanent gallery in the UK covering the history of architecture with displays using models, photographs, elements from buildings and original drawings. With the opening of the new gallery, the RIBA Drawings and Archives Collection has been transferred to the museum, joining the already extensive collection held by the V&A. With over 600,000 drawings, over 750,000 papers and paraphernalia, and over 700,000 photographs from around the world, together they form the world's most comprehensive architectural resource.\n\nNot only are all the major British architects of the last four hundred years represented, but many European (especially Italian) and American architects' drawings are held in the collection. The RIBA's holdings of over 330 drawings by Andrea Palladio are the largest in the world, other Europeans well represented are Jacques Gentilhatre and Antonio Visentini. British architects whose drawings, and in some cases models of their buildings, in the collection, include: Inigo Jones, Sir Christopher Wren, Sir John Vanbrugh, Nicholas Hawksmoor, William Kent, James Gibbs, Robert Adam, Sir William Chambers, James Wyatt, Henry Holland, John Nash, Sir John Soane, Sir Charles Barry, Charles Robert Cockerell, Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, Sir George Gilbert Scott, John Loughborough Pearson, George Edmund Street, Richard Norman Shaw, Alfred Waterhouse, Sir Edwin Lutyens, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Charles Holden, Frank Hoar, Lord Richard Rogers, Lord Norman Foster, Sir Nicholas Grimshaw, Zaha Hadid and Alick Horsnell.\n\nAs well as period rooms, the collection includes parts of buildings, for example the two top stories of the facade of Sir Paul Pindar's house dated c1600 from Bishopsgate with elaborately carved wood work and leaded windows, a rare survivor of the Great Fire of London, there is a brick portal from a London house of the English Restoration period and a fireplace from the gallery of Northumberland house. European examples include a dormer window dated 1523–35 from the chateau of Montal. There are several examples from Italian Renaissance buildings including, portals, fireplaces, balconies and a stone buffet that used to have a built in fountain. The main architecture gallery has a series of pillars from various buildings and different periods, for example a column from the Alhambra. Examples covering Asia are in those galleries concerned with those countries, as well as models and photographs in the main architecture gallery.\n\nThe V&As collection of Art from Asia numbers more than 160,000 objects, one of the largest in existence. It has one of the world's most comprehensive and important collections of Chinese art whilst the collection of South Asian Art is the most important in the West. The museums coverage includes items from South and South East Asia, Himalayan Kingdoms, China, the Far East and the Islamic world.\n\nThe V&A holds over 19,000 items from the Islamic world, ranging from the early Islamic period (the 7th century) to the early 20th century. The Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art, opened in 2006, houses a representative display of 400 objects with the highlight being the Ardabil Carpet, the centrepiece of the gallery. The displays in this gallery cover objects from Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Afghanistan. A masterpiece of Islamic art is a 10th-century Rock crystal ewer. Many examples of Qur'āns with exquisite calligraphy dating from various periods are on display. A 15th-century minbar from a Cairo mosque with ivory forming complex geometrical patterns inlaid in wood is one of the larger objects on display. Extensive examples of ceramics especially Iznik pottery, glasswork including 14th-century lamps from mosques and metalwork are on display. The collection of Middle Eastern and Persian rugs and carpets is amongst the finest in the world, many were part of the Salting Bequest of 1909. Examples of tile work from various buildings including a fireplace dated 1731 from Istanbul made of intricately decorated blue and white tiles and turquoise tiles from the exterior of buildings from Samarkand are also displayed.\n\nThe Museum's collections of South and South-East Asian art are the most comprehensive and important in the West comprising nearly 60,000 objects, including about 10,000 textiles and 6000 paintings, the range of the collection is immense. The Jawaharlal Nehru gallery of Indian art, opened in 1991, contains art from about 500 BC to the 19th century. There is an extensive collection of sculpture, mainly of a religious nature, Hindu, Buddhist and Jain. The gallery is richly endowed with art of the Mughal Empire and the Marathas, including fine portraits of the emperors and other paintings and drawings, jade wine cups and gold spoons inset with emeralds, diamonds and rubies, also from this period are parts of buildings such as a jaali and pillars. India was a large producer of textiles, from dyed cotton chintz, muslin to rich embroidery work using gold and silver thread, coloured sequins and beads is displayed, as are carpets from Agra and Lahore. Examples of clothing are also displayed.\n\nIn 1879–80 the collections of the British East India Company's India Museum were given to the V&A and the British Museum. Most of the items were plundered during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 by the British forces and taken from India. Some of the examples are 'Tipu's Tiger', an automaton and mechanical organ made in Mysore around 1795. It represents a tiger mauling a soldier or officer of the British East India Company. It is named after the ruler of Mysore who commissioned it, Tipu Sultan.\n\nThe wine cup of Shah Jahan was an item that was plundered during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the fall of the Mughal empire to the invading British forces. It was originally a Mughal property and kept at the Red Fort in Delhi. So far there have been no moves by the museum to catalogue and restitute all the stolen items back to India.\n\nThe Far Eastern collections include more than 70,000 works of art from the countries of East Asia: China, Japan and Korea. The T. T. Tsui Gallery of Chinese art opened in 1991, displaying a representative collection of the V&As approximately 16,000 objects from China, dating from the 4th millennium BC to the present day. Though the majority of art works on display date from the Ming and Qing dynasties, there are exquisite examples of objects dating from the Tang dynasty and earlier periods. Notably, a metre-high bronze head of the Buddha dated to c. 750 AD and one of the oldest items a 2,000-year-old jade horse head from a burial, other sculptures include life-size tomb guardians. Classic examples of Chinese manufacturing are displayed that include lacquer, silk, porcelain, jade and cloisonné enamel. Two large ancestor portraits of a husband and wife painted in watercolour on silk date from the 18th century. There is a unique Chinese lacquerware table, made in the imperial workshops during the reign of the Xuande Emperor in the Ming dynasty. Examples of clothing are also displayed. One of the largest objects is a bed from the mid-17th century. The work of contemporary Chinese designers is also displayed.\n\nThe Toshiba gallery of Japanese art opened in December 1986. The majority of exhibits date from 1550 to 1900, but one of the oldest pieces displayed is the 13th-century sculpture of Amida Nyorai. Examples of classic Japanese armour from the mid-19th century, steel sword blades (Katana), Inrō, lacquerware including the Mazarin Chest dated c1640 is one of the finest surviving pieces from Kyoto, porcelain including Imari, Netsuke, woodblock prints including the work of Andō Hiroshige, graphic works include printed books, as well as a few paintings, scrolls and screens, textiles and dress including kimonos are some of the objects on display. One of the finest objects displayed is Suzuki Chokichi's bronze incense burner (koro) dated 1875, standing at over 2.25 metres high and 1.25 metres in diameter it is also one of the largest examples made. The museum also holds some cloisonné pieces from the Japanese art production company, Ando Cloisonné.\n\nThe smaller galleries cover Korea, the Himalayan kingdoms and South East Asia. Korean displays include green-glazed ceramics, silk embroideries from officials' robes and gleaming boxes inlaid with mother-of-pearl made between 500 AD and 2000. Himalayan items include important early Nepalese bronze sculptures, repoussé work and embroidery. Tibetan art from the 14th to the 19th century is represented by notable 14th- and 15th-century religious images in wood and bronze, scroll paintings and ritual objects. Art from Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka in gold, silver, bronze, stone, terracotta and ivory represents these rich and complex cultures, the displays span the 6th to 19th centuries. Refined Hindu and Buddhist sculptures reflect the influence of India; items on show include betel-nut cutters, ivory combs and bronze palanquin hooks.\n\nThe museum houses the National Art Library, a public library containing over 750,000 books, photographs, drawings, paintings, and prints. It is one of the world's largest libraries dedicated to the study of fine and decorative arts. The library covers all areas and periods of the museum's collections with special collections covering illuminated manuscripts, rare books and artists' letters and archives.\n\nThe Library consists of three large public rooms, with around a hundred individual study desks. These are the West Room, Centre Room and Reading Room. The centre room contains 'special collection material'.\n\nOne of the great treasures in the library is the Codex Forster, some of Leonardo da Vinci's note books. The Codex consists of three parchment-bound manuscripts, Forster I, Forster II, and Forster III, quite small in size, dated between 1490 and 1505. Their contents include a large collection of sketches and references to the equestrian sculpture commissioned by the Duke of Milan Ludovico Sforza to commemorate his father Francesco Sforza. These were bequeathed with over 18,000 books to the museum in 1876 by John Forster. The Reverend Alexander Dyce was another benefactor of the library, leaving over 14,000 books to the museum in 1869. Amongst the books he collected are early editions in Greek and Latin of the poets and playwrights Aeschylus, Aristotle, Homer, Livy, Ovid, Pindar, Sophocles and Virgil. More recent authors include Giovanni Boccaccio, Dante, Racine, Rabelais and Molière.\n\nWriters whose papers are in the library are as diverse as Charles Dickens and Beatrix Potter. Illuminated manuscripts in the library dating from the 12th to 16th centuries include: the Eadwine Psalter, Canterbury; Pocket Book of Hours, Reims; Missal from the Royal Abbey of Saint Denis, Paris; the Simon Marmion Book of Hours, Bruges; 1524 Charter illuminated by Lucas Horenbout, London; the Armagnac manuscript of the trial and rehabilitation of Joan of Arc, Rouen. also the Victorian period is represented by William Morris.\n\nThe National Art Library (also called Word and Image Department) at the Victoria and Albert Museum collection catalogue used to be kept in different formats including printed exhibit catalogues, and card catalogues. A computer system called MODES cataloguing system was used from the 1980s to the 1990s, but those electronic files were not available to the library users. All of the archival material at the National Art Library is using Encoded Archival Description (EAD). The Victoria and Albert Museum has a computer system but most of the items in the collection, unless those were newly accessioned into the collection, probably do not show up in the computer system. There is a feature on the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site called \"Search the Collections,\" but not everything is listed there.\n\nThe National Art Library also includes a collection of comics and comic art. Notable parts of the collection include the Krazy Kat Arkive, comprising 4,200 comics, and the Rakoff Collection, comprising 17,000 items collected by writer and editor Ian Rakoff.\n\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum's Word and Image Department was under the same pressure being felt in archives around the world, to digitise their collection. A large scale digitisation project began in 2007 in that department. That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol and to create a factory to completely digitise the collection. The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs using digital cameras. The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. 15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. The second step of the Factory Project is to catalogue everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. All of those items which were photographed and catalogued, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project. The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. There is a \"Search the Collections\" feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. The main impetus behind the large-scale digitisation project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.\nThese fifteen galleries—which opened in November 2001—contain around 4,000 items. The displays in these galleries are based around three major themes: \"Style\", \"Who Led Taste\" and \"What Was New\". The period covered is 1500 to 1900, with the galleries divided into three major subdivisions:\n\n\nNot only the work of British artists and craftspeople is on display, but also work produced by European artists that was purchased or commissioned by British patrons, as well as imports from Asia, including porcelain, cloth and wallpaper. Designers and artists whose work is on display in the galleries include Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Grinling Gibbons, Daniel Marot, Louis Laguerre, Antonio Verrio, Sir James Thornhill, William Kent, Robert Adam, Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton, Canova, Thomas Chippendale, Pugin, William Morris. Patrons who have influenced taste are also represented by works of art from their collections, these include: Horace Walpole (a major influence on the Gothic Revival), William Thomas Beckford and Thomas Hope.\n\nThe galleries showcase a number of complete and partial reconstructions of period rooms, from demolished buildings, including:\n\n\nSome of the more notable works displayed in the galleries include:\n\nThe galleries also link design to wider trends in British culture. For instance, design in the Tudor period was influenced by the spread of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain. In the Stuart period, increasing trade, especially with Asia, enabled wider access to luxuries like carpets, lacquered furniture, silks and porcelain. In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. European styles seen on the Grand Tour also influenced taste. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the growth of mass production produced entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade. In the Victorian era new technology and machinery had a significant effect on manufacturing, and for the first time since the reformation, the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches had a major effect on art and design such as the Gothic Revival. There is a large display on the Great Exhibition which, among other things, led to the founding of the V&A. In the later 19th century, the increasing backlash against industrialisation, led by John Ruskin, contributed to the Arts and Crafts movement.\n\nOne of the most dramatic parts of the museum is the Cast Courts in the sculpture wing, comprising two large, skylighted rooms two storeys high housing hundreds of plaster casts of sculptures, friezes and tombs. One of these is dominated by a full-scale replica of Trajan's Column, cut in half to fit under the ceiling. The other includes reproductions of various works of Italian Renaissance sculpture and architecture, including a full-size replica of Michelangelo's \"David\". Replicas of two earlier Davids by Donatello and Verrocchio, are also included, although for conservation reasons the Verrocchio replica is displayed in a glass case.\n\nThe two courts are divided by corridors on both storeys, and the partitions that used to line the upper corridor (the Gilbert Bayes sculpture gallery) were removed in 2004 to allow the courts to be viewed from above.\n\nThis is the largest and most comprehensive ceramics and glass collection in the world, with over 80,000 objects from around the world. Every populated continent is represented. Apart from the many pieces in the Primary Galleries on the ground floor, much of the top floor is devoted to galleries of ceramics of all periods covered, which include display cases with a representative selection, but also massed \"visible storage\" displays of the reserve collection.\n\nWell represented in the collection is Meissen porcelain, from the first factory in Europe to discover the Chinese method of making porcelain. Among the finest examples are the Meissen Vulture from 1731 and the Möllendorff Dinner Service, designed in 1762 by Frederick II the Great. Ceramics from the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres are extensive, especially from the 18th and 19th centuries. The collection of 18th-century British porcelain is the largest and finest in the world. Examples from every factory are represented, the collections of Chelsea porcelain and Worcester porcelain being especially fine. All the major 19th-century British factories are also represented. A major boost to the collections was the Salting Bequest made in 1909, which enriched the museum's stock of Chinese and Japanese ceramics. This bequest forms part of the finest collection of East Asian pottery and porcelain in the world, including Kakiemon ware.\nMany famous potters, such as Josiah Wedgwood, William De Morgan and Bernard Leach as well as Mintons & Royal Doulton are represented in the collection. There is an extensive collection of Delftware produced in both Britain and Holland, which includes a circa 1695 flower pyramid over a metre in height. Bernard Palissy has several examples of his work in the collection including dishes, jugs and candlesticks. The largest objects in the collection are a series of elaborately ornamented ceramic stoves from the 16th and 17th centuries, made in Germany and Switzerland. There is an unrivalled collection of Italian maiolica and lustreware from Spain. The collection of Iznik pottery from Turkey is the largest in the world.\n\nThe glass collection covers 4000 years of glass making, and has over 6000 items from Africa, Britain, Europe, America and Asia. The earliest glassware on display comes from Ancient Egypt and continues through the Ancient Roman, Medieval, Renaissance covering areas such as Venetian glass and Bohemian glass and more recent periods, including Art Nouveau glass by Louis Comfort Tiffany and Émile Gallé, the Art Deco style is represented by several examples by René Lalique. There are many examples of crystal chandeliers both English, displayed in the British galleries and foreign for example Venetian (attributed to Giuseppe Briati) dated c1750 are in the collection. The stained glass collection is possibly the finest in the world, covering the medieval to modern periods, and covering Europe as well as Britain. Several examples of English 16th-century heraldic glass is displayed in the British Galleries. Many well-known designers of stained glass are represented in the collection including, from the 19th century: Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. There is also an example of Frank Lloyd Wright's work in the collection. 20th-century designers include Harry Clarke, John Piper, Patrick Reyntiens, Veronica Whall and Brian Clarke.\n\nThe main gallery was redesigned in 1994, the glass balustrade on the staircase and mezzanine are the work of Danny Lane, the gallery covering contemporary glass opened in 2004 and the sacred silver and stained-glass gallery in 2005. In this latter gallery stained glass is displayed alongside silverware starting in the 12th century and continuing to the present. Some of the most outstanding stained glass, dated 1243–48 comes from the Sainte-Chapelle, is displayed along with other examples in the new Medieval & Renaissance galleries. The important 13th-century glass beaker known as the Luck of Edenhall is also displayed in these galleries. Examples of British stained glass are displayed in the British Galleries. One of the most spectacular items in the collection is the chandelier by Dale Chihuly in the rotunda at the Museum's main entrance.\n\nThese galleries are dedicated to temporary exhibits showcasing both trends from recent decades and the latest in design and fashion.\n\nPrints and drawings from the over 750,000 items in the collection can be seen on request at the print room, the \"Prints and Drawings study Room\"; booking an appointment is necessary. The collection of drawings includes over 10,000 British and 2,000 old master works, including works by: Dürer, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, Bernardo Buontalenti, Rembrandt, Antonio Verrio, Paul Sandby, John Russell, Angelica Kauffman, John Flaxman, Hugh Douglas Hamilton, Thomas Rowlandson, William Kilburn, Thomas Girtin, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, David Wilkie, John Martin, Samuel Palmer, Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, Lord Frederic Leighton, Sir Samuel Luke Fildes and Aubrey Beardsley. Modern British artists represented in the collection include: Paul Nash, Percy Wyndham Lewis, Eric Gill, Stanley Spencer, John Piper, Robert Priseman, Graham Sutherland, Lucian Freud and David Hockney.\n\nThe print collection has more than 500,000 items, covering: posters, greetings cards, book plates, as well as a comprehensive collection of old master prints from the Renaissance to the present, including works by Rembrandt, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Canaletto, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Henri Matisse and Sir William Nicholson.\n\nThe costume collection is the most comprehensive in Britain, containing over 14,000 outfits plus accessories, mainly dating from 1600 to the present. Costume sketches, design notebooks, and other works on paper are typically held by the Word and Image department. Because everyday clothing from previous eras has not generally survived, the collection is dominated by fashionable clothes made for special occasions. One of the first significant gifts of costume came in 1913 when the V&A received the Talbot Hughes collection containing 1,442 costumes and items as a gift from Harrods following its display at the nearby department store.\n\nSome of the oldest items in the collection are medieval vestments, especially Opus Anglicanum. One of the most important items in the collection is the wedding suit of James II of England, which is displayed in the British Galleries.\n\nIn 1971, Cecil Beaton curated an exhibition of 1,200 20th-century high-fashion garments and accessories, including gowns worn by leading socialites such as Patricia Lopez-Willshaw, Gloria Guinness and Lee Radziwill, and actresses such as Audrey Hepburn and Ruth Ford. After the exhibition, Beaton donated most of the exhibits to the Museum in the names of their former owners.\n\nIn 1999, V&A began a series of live catwalk events at the museum titled \"Fashion in Motion\" featuring items from historically significant fashion collections. The first show featured Alexander McQueen in June 1999. Since then, the museum has hosted recreations of various designer shows every year including Anna Sui, Tristan Webber, Elspeth Gibson, Chunghie Lee, Jean Paul Gaultier, Missoni, Gianfranco Ferré, Christian Lacroix, Kenzo and Kansai Yamamoto amongst others.\n\nIn 2002, the Museum acquired the Costiff collection of 178 Vivienne Westwood costumes. Other famous designers with work in the collection include Coco Chanel, Hubert de Givenchy, Christian Dior, Cristóbal Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent, Guy Laroche, Irene Galitzine, Mila Schön, Valentino Garavani, Norman Norell, Norman Hartnell, Zandra Rhodes, Hardy Amies, Mary Quant, Christian Lacroix, Jean Muir and Pierre Cardin. The museum continues to acquire examples of modern fashion to add to the collection.\n\nThe V&A runs an ongoing textile and dress conservation programme. For example, in 2008 an important but heavily soiled, distorted and water-damaged 1954 Dior outfit called \"Zemire\" was restored to displayable condition for the \"Golden Age of Couture\" exhibition.\nV&A Museum has a large collection of shoes around 2.000 pairs from different cultures around the world. The collection shows the chronological progression of shoe height, heel shape and materials, exposing just how many styles we consider to be modern have been in and out of fashion across the centuries. \n\nIn November 2012, the Museum opened its first gallery to be exclusively dedicated to furniture. Prior to this date furniture had been exhibited as part of a greater period context, rather than in isolation to showcase its design and construction merits. Among the designers showcased in the new gallery are Ron Arad, John Henry Belter, Joe Colombo, Eileen Gray, Verner Panton, Thonet, and Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nThe furniture collection, while covering Europe and America from the Middle Ages to the present, is predominantly British, dating between 1700 and 1900. Many of the finest examples are displayed in the British Galleries, including pieces by Chippendale, Adam, Morris, and Mackintosh. One of the oldest items is a chair leg from Middle Egypt dated to 200-395AD.\n\nThe Furniture and Woodwork collection also includes complete rooms, musical instruments, and clocks. Among the rooms owned by the Museum are the Boudoir of Madame de Sévilly (Paris, 1781–82) by Claude Nicolas Ledoux, with painted panelling by Jean Simeon Rousseau de la Rottière; and Frank Lloyd Wright's Kaufmann Office, designed and constructed between 1934 and 1937 for the owner of a Pittsburgh department store.\n\nThe collection includes pieces by William Kent, Henry Flitcroft, Matthias Lock, James Stuart, William Chambers, John Gillow, James Wyatt, Thomas Hopper, Charles Heathcote Tatham, Pugin, William Burges, Charles Voysey, Charles Robert Ashbee, Baillie Scott, Edwin Lutyens, Edward Maufe, Wells Coates and Robin Day. The museum also hosts the national collection of wallpaper, which is looked after by the Prints, Drawings and Paintings department.\n\nThe Soulages collection of Italian and French Renaissance objects was acquired between 1859 and 1865, and includes several cassone. The John Jones Collection of French 18th-century art and furnishings was left to the museum in 1882, then valued at £250,000. One of the most important pieces in this collection is a marquetry commode by the \"ébéniste\" Jean Henri Riesener dated c1780. Other signed pieces of furniture in the collection include a bureau by Jean-François Oeben, a pair of pedestals with inlaid brass work by André Charles Boulle, a commode by Bernard Vanrisamburgh and a work-table by Martin Carlin. Other 18th-century ébénistes represented in the Museum collection include Adam Weisweiler, David Roentgen, Gilles Joubert and Pierre Langlois. In 1901, Sir George Donaldson donated several pieces of art Nouveau furniture to the museum, which he had acquired the previous year at the Paris Exposition Universelle. This was criticised at the time, with the result that the museum ceased to collect contemporary items and did not do so again until the 1960s. In 1986 the Lady Abingdon collection of French Empire furniture was bequeathed by Mrs T. R. P. Hole.\n\nThere are a set of beautiful inlaid doors, dated 1580 from Antwerp City Hall, attributed to Hans Vredeman de Vries. One of the finest pieces of continental furniture in the collection is the Rococo Augustus Rex Bureau Cabinet dated c1750 from Germany, with especially fine marquetry and ormolu mounts. One of the grandest pieces of 19th-century furniture is the highly elaborate French Cabinet dated 1861–1867 made by M. Fourdinois, made from ebony inlaid with box, lime, holly, pear, walnut and mahogany woods as well as marble with gilded carvings. Furniture designed by Ernest Gimson, Edward William Godwin, Charles Voysey, Adolf Loos and Otto Wagner are among the late 19th-century and early 20th-century examples in the collection. The work of modernists in the collection include Le Corbusier, Marcel Breuer, Charles and Ray Eames, and Giò Ponti.\n\nOne of the oldest clocks in the collection is an astronomical clock of 1588 by Francis Nowe. One of the largest is James Markwick the younger's longcase clock of 1725, nearly 3 metres in height and japanned. Other clock makers with work in the collection include: Thomas Tompion, Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy, John Ellicott and William Carpenter.\n\nThe jewellery collection, containing over 6000 items is one of the finest and most comprehensive collections of jewellery in the world and includes works dating from Ancient Egypt to the present day, as well as jewellery designs on paper. The museum owns pieces by renowned jewellers Cartier, Jean Schlumberger, Peter Carl Fabergé, Andrew Grima, Hemmerle and Lalique. Other items in the collection include diamond dress ornaments made for Catherine the Great, bracelet clasps once belonging to Marie Antoinette, and the Beauharnais emerald necklace presented by Napoleon to his adopted daughter Hortense de Beauharnais in 1806. The museum also collects international modern jewellery by designers such as Gijs Bakker, Onno Boekhoudt, Peter Chang, Gerda Flockinger, Lucy Sarneel, Dorothea Prühl and Wendy Ramshaw, and African and Asian traditional jewellery. Major bequests include Reverend Chauncy Hare Townshend's collection of 154 gems bequeathed in 1869, Lady Cory's 1951 gift of major diamond jewellery from the 18th and 19th centuries, and jewellery scholar Dame Joan Evans' 1977 gift of more than 800 jewels dating from the Middle Ages to the early 19th century. A new jewellery gallery, funded by William and Judith Bollinger, opened on 24 May 2008.\n\nThis collection of more than 45,000 items covers decorative ironwork, both wrought and cast, bronze, silverware, arms and armour, pewter, brassware and enamels (including many examples Limoges enamel). The main iron work gallery was redesigned in 1995.\n\nThere are over 10,000 objects made from silver or gold in the collection, the display (about 15% of the collection) is divided into secular and sacred covering both Christian (Roman Catholic, Anglican and Greek Orthodox) and Jewish liturgical vessels and items. The main silver gallery is divided into these areas: British silver pre-1800; British silver 1800 to 1900; modernist to contemporary silver; European silver. The collection includes the earliest known piece of English silver with a dated hallmark, a silver gilt beaker dated 1496–97.\nSilversmiths' whose work is represented in the collection include Paul de Lamerie and Paul Storr whose Castlereagh Inkstand dated 1817–19 is one of his finest works.\nThe main iron work gallery covers European wrought and cast iron from the mediaeval period to the early 20th century. The master of wrought ironwork Jean Tijou is represented by both examples of his work and designs on paper. One of the largest items is the Hereford Screen, weighing nearly 8 tonnes, 10.5 metres high and 11 metres wide, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1862 for the chancel in Hereford Cathedral, from which it was removed in 1967. It was made by Skidmore & Company. Its structure of timber and cast iron is embellished with wrought iron, burnished brass and copper. Much of the copper and ironwork is painted in a wide range of colours. The arches and columns are decorated with polished quartz and panels of mosaic.\n\nOne of the rarest items in the collection is the 58 cm high Gloucester Candlestick, dated to c1110, made from gilt bronze; with highly elaborate and intricate intertwining branches containing small figures and inscriptions, it is a tour de force of bronze casting. Also of importance is the Becket Casket dated c1180 to contain relics of St Thomas Becket, made from gilt copper, with enamelled scenes of the saint's martyrdom. Another highlight is the 1351 Reichenau Crozier. The Burghley Nef, a salt-cellar, French, dated 1527–28, uses a nautilus shell to form the hull of a vessel, which rests on the tail of a parcelgilt mermaid, who rests on a hexagonal gilt plinth on six claw-and-ball feet. Both masts have main and top-sails, and battlemented fighting-tops are made from gold. These items are displayed in the new Medieval & Renaissance galleries.\n\nMusical instruments are classified as furniture by the museum, although Asian instruments are held by their relevant departments.\n\nAmong the more important instruments owned by the museum are a violin by Antonio Stradivari dated 1699, an oboe that belonged to Gioachino Rossini, and a jewelled spinet dated 1571 made by Annibale Rossi. The collection also includes a c. 1570 virginal said to have belonged to Elizabeth I, and late 19th-century pianos designed by Edward Burne-Jones, and Baillie Scott.\n\nThe Musical Instruments gallery closed 25 February 2010, a decision which was highly controversial. An online petition of over 5,100 names on the Parliamentary website led to Chris Smith asking Parliament about the future of the collection. The answer, from Bryan Davies was that the museum intended to preserve and care for the collection and keep it available to the public, with items being redistributed to the British Galleries, the Medieval & Renaissance Galleries, and the planned new galleries for Furniture and Europe 1600–1800, and that the Horniman Museum and other institutions were possible candidates for loans of material to ensure that the instruments remained publicly viewable. The Horniman went on to host a joint exhibition with the V&A of musical instruments, and has the loan of 35 instruments from the museum.\nThe collection includes about 1130 British and 650 European oil paintings, 6800 British watercolours, pastels and 2000 miniatures, for which the museum holds the national collection. Also on loan to the museum, from Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth II, are the Raphael Cartoons: the seven surviving (there were ten) full scale designs for tapestries in the Sistine Chapel, of the lives of Peter and Paul from the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. There is also on display a fresco by Pietro Perugino dated 1522 from the church of Castello at Fontignano (Perugia) and is amongst the painter's last works. One of the largest objects in the collection is the Spanish tempera on wood, 670 x 486 cm, retable of St George, c. 1400, consisting of numerous scenes and painted by Andrés Marzal De Sax in Valencia.\n\n19th-century British artists are well represented. John Constable and J. M. W. Turner are represented by oil paintings, water colours and drawings. One of the most unusual objects on display is Thomas Gainsborough's experimental showbox with its back-lit landscapes, which he painted on glass, which allowed them to be changed like slides. Other landscape painters with works on display include Philip James de Loutherbourg, Peter De Wint and John Ward.\n\nIn 1857 John Sheepshanks donated 233 paintings, mainly by contemporary British artists, and a similar number of drawings to the museum with the intention of forming a 'A National Gallery of British Art', a role since taken on by Tate Britain; artists represented are William Blake, James Barry, Henry Fuseli, Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, Sir David Wilkie, William Mulready, William Powell Frith, Millais and Hippolyte Delaroche. Although some of Constable's works came to the museum with the Sheepshanks bequest, the majority of the artist's works were donated by his daughter Isabel in 1888, including the large number of sketches in oil, the most significant being the 1821 full size oil sketch for \"The Hay Wain\". Other artists with works in the collection include: Bernardino Fungai, Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, Domenico di Pace Beccafumi, Fioravante Ferramola, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Anthony van Dyck, Ludovico Carracci, Antonio Verrio, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Domenico Tiepolo, Canaletto, Francis Hayman, Pompeo Batoni, Benjamin West, Paul Sandby, Richard Wilson, William Etty, Henry Fuseli, Sir Thomas Lawrence, James Barry, Francis Danby, Richard Parkes Bonington and Alphonse Legros.\n\nRichard Ellison's collection of 100 British watercolours was given by his widow in 1860 and 1873 'to promote the foundation of the National Collection of Water Colour Paintings'. Over 500 British and European oil paintings, watercolours and miniatures and 3000 drawings and prints were bequeathed in 1868-9 by the clergymen Chauncey Hare Townshend and Alexander Dyce.\n\nSeveral French paintings entered the collection as part of the 260 paintings and miniatures (not all the works were French, for example Carlo Crivelli's \"Virgin and Child\") that formed part of the Jones bequest of 1882 and as such are displayed in the galleries of continental art 1600–1800, including the portrait of François, Duc d'Alençon by François Clouet, Gaspard Dughet and works by François Boucher including his portrait of Madame de Pompadour dated 1758, Jean François de Troy, Jean-Baptiste Pater and their contemporaries.\n\nAnother major Victorian benefactor was Constantine Alexander Ionides, who left 82 oil paintings to the museum in 1901, including works by Botticelli, Tintoretto, Adriaen Brouwer, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet, Eugène Delacroix, Théodore Rousseau, Edgar Degas, Jean-François Millet, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, plus watercolours and over a thousand drawings and prints\n\nThe Salting Bequest of 1909 included, among other works, watercolours by J. M. W. Turner. Other watercolourists include: William Gilpin, Thomas Rowlandson, William Blake, John Sell Cotman, Paul Sandby, William Mulready, Edward Lear, James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Paul Cézanne.\n\nThere is a copy of Raphael's \"The School of Athens\" over 4 metres by 8 metres in size, dated 1755 by Anton Raphael Mengs on display in the eastern Cast Court.\n\nMiniaturists represented in the collection include Jean Bourdichon, Hans Holbein the Younger, Nicholas Hilliard, Isaac Oliver, Peter Oliver, Jean Petitot, Alexander Cooper, Samuel Cooper, Thomas Flatman, Rosalba Carriera, Christian Friedrich Zincke, George Engleheart, John Smart, Richard Cosway and William Charles Ross.\n\nThe collection contains more than 500,000 images dating from the advent of photography, the oldest image dating from 1839. The gallery displays a series of changing exhibits and closes between exhibitions to allow full re-display to take place. Already in 1858, when the museum was called the South Kensington Museum, it had the world's first international photographic exhibition.\n\nThe collection includes the work of many photographers from Fox Talbot, Julia Margaret Cameron, Viscountess Clementina Hawarden, Gustave Le Gray, Benjamin Brecknell Turner, Frederick Hollyer, Samuel Bourne, Roger Fenton, Man Ray, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Ilse Bing, Bill Brandt, Cecil Beaton (there are more than 8000 of his negatives), Don McCullin, David Bailey, Jim Lee and Helen Chadwick to the present day.\n\nOne of the more unusual collections is that of Eadweard Muybridge's photographs of Animal Locomotion of 1887, this consists of 781 plates. These sequences of photographs taken a fraction of a second apart capture images of different animals and humans performing various actions. There are several of John Thomson's 1876-7 images of Street Life in London in the collection. The museum also holds James Lafayette's society portraits, a collection of more than 600 photographs dating from the late 19th to early 20th centuries and portraying a wide range of society figures of the period, including bishops, generals, society ladies, Indian maharajas, Ethiopian rulers and other foreign leaders, actresses, people posing in their motor cars and a sequence of photographs recording the guests at the famous fancy-dress ball held at Devonshire House in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee.\n\nIn 2003 and 2007 Penelope Smail and Kathleen Moffat generously donated Curtis Moffat's extensive archive to the museum. He created dynamic abstract photographs, innovative colour still-lives and glamorous society portraits during the 1920s and 1930s. He was also a pivotal figure in Modernist interior design. In Paris during the 1920s, Moffat collaborated with Man Ray, producing portraits and abstract photograms or \"rayographs\".\n\nThe sculpture collection at the V&A is the most comprehensive holding of post-classical European sculpture in the world. There are approximately 22,000 objects in the collection that cover the period from about 400 AD to 1914. This covers among other periods Byzantine and Anglo Saxon ivory sculptures, British, French and Spanish medieval statues and carvings, the Renaissance, Baroque, Neo-Classical, Victorian and Art Nouveau periods. All uses of sculpture are represented, from tomb and memorial, to portrait, allegorical, religious, mythical, statues for gardens including fountains, as well as architectural decorations. Materials used include, marble, alabaster, stone, terracotta, wood (history of wood carving), ivory, gesso, plaster, bronze, lead and ceramics.\n\nThe collection of Italian, Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical sculpture (both original and in cast form) is unequalled outside of Italy. It includes Canova's \"The Three Graces\", which the museum jointly owns with National Galleries of Scotland. Italian sculptors whose work is held by the museum include: Bartolomeo Bon, Bartolomeo Bellano, Luca della Robbia, Giovanni Pisano, Donatello, Agostino di Duccio, Andrea Riccio, Antonio Rossellino, Andrea del Verrocchio, Antonio Lombardo, Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi, Andrea della Robbia, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo, Michelangelo (represented by a freehand wax model and casts of his most famous sculptures), Jacopo Sansovino, Alessandro Algardi, Antonio Calcagni, Benvenuto Cellini (Medusa's head dated c. 1547), Agostino Busti, Bartolomeo Ammannati, Giacomo della Porta, Giambologna (Samson Slaying a Philistine c. 1562, his finest work outside Italy), Bernini (Neptune and Triton c. 1622–3), Giovanni Battista Foggini, Vincenzo Foggini (Samson and the Philistines), Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, Antonio Corradini, Andrea Brustolon, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Innocenzo Spinazzi, Canova, Carlo Marochetti and Raffaelle Monti. An unusual sculpture is the ancient Roman statue of Narcissus restored by Valerio Cioli c1564 with plaster. There are several small scale bronzes by Donatello, Alessandro Vittoria, Tiziano Aspetti and Francesco Fanelli in the collection. The largest item from Italy is the Chancel Chapel from Santa Chiara Florence dated 1493–1500, designed by Giuliano da Sangallo it is 11.1 metres in height by 5.4 metres square, it includes a grand sculpted tabernacle by Antonio Rossellino and coloured terracotta decoration.\n\nRodin is represented by more than 20 works in the museum collection, making it one of the largest collections of the sculptor's work outside France; these were given to the museum by the sculptor in 1914, as acknowledgement of Britain's support of France in World War I, although the statue of St John the Baptist had been purchased in 1902 by public subscription. Other French sculptors with work in the collection are Hubert Le Sueur, François Girardon, Michel Clodion, Jean-Antoine Houdon, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and Jules Dalou.\n\nThere are also several Renaissance works by Northern European sculptors in the collection including work by: Veit Stoss, Tilman Riemenschneider, Hendrick de Keyser, Jan van Schayck, Hans Daucher and Peter Flötner. Baroque works from the same area include the work of, Adriaen de Vries and Sébastien Slodtz. The Spanish sculptors with work in the collection include Alonso Berruguete and Luisa Roldán represented by her \"Virgin and Child with St Diego of Alcala\" c. 1695.\n\nSculptors both British and Europeans who were based in Britain and whose work is in the collection include Nicholas Stone, Caius Gabriel Cibber, Grinling Gibbons, John Michael Rysbrack, Louis-François Roubiliac, Peter Scheemakers, Sir Henry Cheere, Agostino Carlini, Thomas Banks, Joseph Nollekens, Joseph Wilton, John Flaxman, Sir Francis Chantrey, John Gibson, Edward Hodges Baily, Lord Leighton, Alfred Stevens, Thomas Brock, Alfred Gilbert, George Frampton, and Eric Gill. A sample of some of these sculptors' work is on display in the British Galleries.\n\nWith the opening of the Dorothy and Michael Hintze sculpture galleries in 2006 it was decided to extend the chronology of the works on display up to 1950; this has involved loans by other museums, including Tate Britain, so works by Henry Moore and Jacob Epstein along with other of their contemporaries are now on view. These galleries concentrate on works dated 1600 to 1950 by British sculptors, works by continental sculptors who worked in Britain, and works bought by British patrons from the continental sculptors, such as Canova's \"Theseus and the Minotaur\". The galleries overlooking the garden are arranged by theme, tomb sculpture, portraiture, garden sculpture and mythology. Then there is a section that covers late 19th-century and early 20th-century sculpture, this includes work by Rodin and other French sculptors such as Dalou who spent several years in Britain where he taught sculpture.\n\nSmaller-scale works are displayed in the Gilbert Bayes gallery, covering medieval especially English alabaster sculpture, bronzes, wooden sculptures and has demonstrations of various techniques such as bronze casting using lost-wax casting.\n\nThe majority of the Medieval and Renaissance sculpture is displayed in the new Medieval and Renaissance galleries (opened December 2009).\n\nOne of the largest objects in the collection is the 's-Hertogenbosch rood loft, from the Netherlands, dated 1610–13 this is as much a work of architecture as sculpture, 10.4 metres wide, 7.8 metres high, the architectural framework is of various coloured marbles including columns, arches and balustrade, against which are statues and bas-reliefs and other carvings in alabaster, the work of sculptor Conrad van Norenberch.\n\nThe collection of textiles consists of more than 53,000 examples, mainly western European though all populated continents are represented, dating from the 1st century AD to the present, this is the largest such collection in the world. Techniques represented include weaving, printing, quilting embroidery, lace, tapestry and carpets. These are classified by technique, countries of origin and date of production. The collections are well represented in these areas: early silks from the Near East, lace, European tapestries and English medieval church embroidery.\n\nThe tapestry collection includes a fragment of the Cloth of St Gereon, the oldest known surviving European tapestry. A highlight of the collection is the four Devonshire Hunting Tapestries, very rare 15th-century tapestries, woven in the Netherlands, depicting the hunting of various animals; not just their age but their size make these unique. Both of the major English centres of tapestry weaving of the 16th and 17th centuries respectively, Sheldon & Mortlake are represented in the collection by several examples. Also included are tapestries from John Vanderbank's workshop which was the leading English tapestry manufactory in the late 17th century and early 18th century. Some of the finest tapestries are examples from the Gobelins workshop, including a set of 'Jason and the Argonauts' dating from the 1750s. Other continental centres of tapestry weaving with work in the collection include Brussels, Tournai, Beauvais, Strasbourg and Florence.\n\nOne of the earliest surviving examples of European quilting, the late 14th-century Sicilian Tristan Quilt, is also held by the collection. The collection has numerous examples of various types of textiles designed by William Morris, including, embroidery, woven fabrics, tapestries (Including 'The Forest' tapestry of 1887), rugs and carpets, as well as pattern books and paper designs. The art deco period is covered by rugs and fabrics designed by Marion Dorn. From the same period there is a rug designed by Serge Chermayeff.\n\nThe collection also includes the Oxburgh Hangings, which were made by Mary, Queen of Scots and Bess of Hardwick. However, the Oxburgh Hangings are on permanent long-term loan at Oxburgh Hall.\n\nThe V&A holds the national collection of performing arts in the UK, including drama, dance, opera, circus, puppetry, comedy, musical theatre, costume, set design, pantomime, popular music and other forms of live entertainment.\n\nThe Theatre & Performance collections were founded in the 1920s when private collector, Gabrielle Enthoven, donated her collection of theatrical memorabilia to the V&A. In 1974 two further independent collections were compiled to form a comprehensive performing arts collection at the V&A. The collections were displayed at the Theatre Museum, which operated from Covent Garden until closing in 2007. Theatre & Performance galleries opened at South Kensington in March 2009 tracing the production process of performance and include a temporary exhibition space. Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.\n\nThe department holds significant archives documenting current practice and the history of performing arts. These include the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre, D'Oyly Carte and the design collection of the Arts Council. Notable personal archives include Vivien Leigh, Peter Brook, Henry Irving and Ivor Novello.\n\nRock and pop are well represented with the Glastonbury Festival archive, Harry Hammond photographic collection and Jamie Reid archive documenting punk. Costumes include those worn by John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Elton John, Adam Ant, Chris Martin, Iggy Pop, Prince, Shirley Bassey and the stage outfit worn by Roger Daltrey at Woodstock.\n\nThe education department has wide-ranging responsibilities. It provides information for the casual visitor as well as for school groups, including integrating learning in the museum with the National Curriculum; it provides research facilities for students at degree level and beyond, with information and access to the collections. It also oversees the content of the museum's web site in addition to publishing books and papers on the collections, research and other aspects of the museum.\n\nSeveral areas of the collection have dedicated study rooms, these allow access to items in the collection that are not currently on display, but in some cases require an appointment to be made.\n\nThe new Sackler education suite, occupying the two lower floors of the Henry Cole Wing opened in September 2008. This includes lecture rooms and areas for use by schools, which will be available during school holidays for use by families, and will enable direct handling of items from the collection.\n\nV&A Publishing within the education department work to raise funds for the museum by publishing around 30 books and digital items each year. The company have around 180 books in print.\n\nActivity backpacks are available for children. These are free to borrow and include hands-on activities such as puzzles, construction games and stories related to themes of the museum.\n\nThe Learning Academy offers adult courses as well as training for professionals in the culture and heritage sector, both nationally and internationally. We also have great facilities in which to teach, study and get closer to our collections. Learning Activity\n\nResearch is a very important area of the museum's work, and includes: identification and interpretation of individual objects; other studies contribute to systematic research, this develops the public understanding of the art and artefacts of many of the great cultures of the world; visitor research and evaluation to discover the needs of visitors and their experiences of the museum. Since 1990 the museum has published research reports these focus on all areas of the collections.\n\nConservation is responsible for the long-term preservation of the collections, and covers all the collections held by the V&A and the V&A Museum of Childhood. The conservators specialise in particular areas of conservation. Areas covered by conservator's work include \"preventive\" conservation this includes: performing surveys, assessments and providing advice on the handling of items, correct packaging, mounting and handling procedures during movement and display to reduce risk of damaging objects. Activities include controlling the museum environment (for example, temperature and light) and preventing pests (primarily insects) from damaging artefacts. The other major category is \"interventive\" conservation, this includes: cleaning and reintegration to strengthen fragile objects, reveal original surface decoration, and restore shape. Interventive treatment makes an object more stable, but also more attractive and comprehensible to the viewer. It is usually undertaken on items that are to go on public display.\n\nThe V&A has large galleries devoted to temporary exhibitions. A typical year will see more than a dozen different exhibitions being staged, covering all areas of the collections. Notable exhibitions of recent years have been:\n\n\nThe V&A came second in London's top paid exhibitions in 2015 with the record-breaking Alexander McQueen show (3,472 a day).\n\n\n\"English paintings\"\n\"French paintings\"\n\"Italian paintings\"\n\"Sculptures\"\n\n\"gothic Art\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "147952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147952", "title": "Videotape", "text": "Videotape\n\nVideotape is magnetic tape used for storing video and usually sound in addition. Information stored can be in the form of either an analog signal or digital signal. Videotape is used in both video tape recorders (VTRs) or, more commonly, videocassette recorders (VCRs) and camcorders. Videotapes are also used for storing scientific or medical data, such as the data produced by an electrocardiogram. \n\nBecause video signals have a very high bandwidth, and stationary heads would require extremely high tape speeds, in most cases, a helical-scan video head rotates against the moving tape to record the data in two dimensions. \n\nTape is a linear method of storing information and thus imposes delays to access a portion of the tape that is not already under the heads. The early 2000s saw the introduction and rise to prominence of high quality random-access video recording media such as hard disks and flash memory. Since then, videotape has been increasingly relegated to archival and similar uses.\n\nThe electronics division of entertainer Bing Crosby's production company, Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE), gave the world's first demonstration of a videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by John T. Mullin and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device gave what were described as \"blurred and indistinct\" images using a modified Ampex 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (0.6 cm) audio tape moving at 360 inches (9.1 m) per second. A year later, an improved version using one-inch (2.54 cm) magnetic tape was shown to the press, who reportedly expressed amazement at the quality of the images although they had a \"persistent grainy quality that looked like a worn motion picture\". Overall the picture quality was still considered inferior to the best kinescope recordings on film. Bing Crosby Enterprises hoped to have a commercial version available in 1954 but none came forth.\n\nThe BBC experimented from 1952 to 1958 with a high-speed linear videotape system called VERA, but this was ultimately unfeasible. It used half-inch (1.27 cm) tape on 20-inch reels traveling at 200 inches (5.08 m) per second.\n\nRCA demonstrated the magnetic tape recording of both black-and-white and color television programs at its Princeton laboratories on December 1, 1953. The high-speed longitudinal tape system, called Simplex, in development since 1951, could record and play back only a few minutes of a television program. The color system used half-inch (1.3 cm) tape on 10-1/2 inch reels to record five tracks, one each for red, blue, green, synchronization, and audio. The black-and-white system used quarter-inch (0.6 cm) tape also on 10-1/2 inch reels with two tracks, one for video and one for audio. Both systems ran at 360 inches (9.1 m/30 feet) per second with 2,500 feet on a reel. RCA-owned NBC first used it on \"The Jonathan Winters Show\" on October 23, 1956 when a prerecorded song sequence by Dorothy Collins in color was included in the otherwise live television program.\n\nIn 1953, Dr. Norikazu Sawazaki developed a prototype helical scan video tape recorder.\n\nBCE demonstrated a color system in February 1955 using a longitudinal recording on half-inch (1.3 cm) tape. CBS, RCA's competitor, was about to order BCE machines when Ampex introduced the superior Quadruplex system. BCE was acquired by 3M Company in 1956.\n\nIn 1959, Toshiba released the first commercial helical scan video tape recorder.\n\nThe first commercial professional broadcast quality videotape machines capable of replacing kinescopes were the two-inch quadruplex videotape (Quad) machines introduced by Ampex on April 14, 1956 at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Chicago. Quad employed a transverse (scanning the tape across its width) four-head system on a two-inch (5.08 cm) tape, and stationary heads for the sound track.\n\nCBS Television first used the Ampex VRX-1000 Mark IV at its Television City studios in Hollywood on November 30, 1956 to play a delayed broadcast of \"Douglas Edwards and the News\" from New York City to the Pacific Time Zone. On January 22, 1957, the NBC Television game show \"Truth or Consequences\", produced in Hollywood, became the first program to be broadcast in all time zones from a prerecorded videotape. Ampex introduced a color videotape recorder in 1958 in a cross-licensing agreement with RCA, whose engineers had developed it from an Ampex black-and-white recorder. NBC's special, \"An Evening With Fred Astaire\" (1958), is the oldest surviving television network color videotape, and has been restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.\n\nOn December 7, 1963, instant replay was used for the first time during the live transmission of the Army–Navy Game by its inventor, director Tony Verna. \n\nAlthough Quad became the industry standard for approximately thirty years, it has drawbacks such as an inability to freeze pictures, and no picture search. Also, in early machines, a tape could reliably be played back using only the same set of hand-made tape heads, which wore out very quickly. Despite these problems, Quad is capable of producing excellent images. Subsequent videotape systems have used helical scan, where the video heads record diagonal tracks (of complete fields) onto the tape.\n\nMany early videotape recordings were not preserved. While much less expensive (if repeatedly recycled) and more convenient than kinescope, the high cost of 3M Scotch 179 and other early videotapes ($300 per one-hour reel) meant that most broadcasters erased and reused them, and (in the United States) regarded videotape as simply a better and more cost-effective means of time-delaying broadcasts than kinescopes. It was the four time zones of the continental United States which had made the system very desirable in the first place.\n\nHowever, some classic television programs originally recorded on studio videotape still exist, and are available on DVD - among them NBC's \"Peter Pan\" (first telecast in 1960) with Mary Martin as Peter, several episodes of the Dinah Shore Chevy Show (late 1950s/early 60s), the final Howdy Doody Show (1960), the television version of Hal Holbrook's one-man show \"Mark Twain Tonight\" (first telecast in 1967), and Mikhail Baryshnikov's classic production of the ballet \"The Nutcracker\" (first telecast in 1977). Recently, a historic videotape emerged: a west-coast, delayed broadcast videotape made of a live telecast of \"The Edsel Show\" (1957) was found in the CBS archives and has been digitally transferred.\n\nThe next format to gain widespread usage was the 1\" (2.54 cm) Type C format, introduced in 1976 (although some sources say 1978). This format introduced features such as shuttling, various-speed playback (including slow-motion), and still framing, but the sound and picture reproduction attainable on the format were of slightly lower quality than Quad (although 1\" Type C's quality was still quite high). However, compared to Quad, 1\" Type C machines required much less maintenance, took up less space, and consumed much less electrical power.\n\nIn Europe a similar tape format was developed, called Type B. Type B machines (also known as BCN) use the same 1\" tape as Type C but they lacked C's shuttle and slow-motion options. The picture quality is slightly better, though. Type B was the broadcast norm in continental Europe for most of the 1980s.\n\nA videocassette is a cartridge containing videotape. In 1969, Sony introduced a prototype for the first widespread video cassette, the 3/4\" (1.905 cm) composite U-matic system, which Sony introduced commercially in September 1971 after working out industry standards with other manufacturers. Sony later refined it to \"Broadcast Video U-matic\" or BVU. Sony continued its hold on the professional market with its ever-expanding 1/2\" (1.27 cm) component video Betacam family (introduced in 1982), which, in its digital variants, is still among the professional market leaders. Panasonic had some limited success with its MII system, but never could compare to Betacam in terms of market share.\n\nThe next step was the digital revolution. Among the first digital video formats was Sony's D-1, which featured uncompressed digital component recording. Because D-1 was extremely expensive, the composite D-2 and D-3 (by Sony and Panasonic, respectively) were introduced soon after. Ampex introduced the first compressed component recording with its DCT series in 1992. Panasonic trumped D-1 with its D-5 format, which is uncompressed as well, but much more affordable.\n\nThe DV standard, which debuted in 1996, has become widely used both in its native form and in more robust forms such as Sony's DVCAM and Panasonic's DVCPRO as an acquisition and editing format. \n\nFor camcorders, Sony adapted the Betacam system with its Digital Betacam format, later following it up with the cheaper Betacam SX and MPEG IMX formats, and the semiprofessional DV-based DVCAM system. Panasonic used its DV variant DVCPRO for all professional cameras, with the higher-end format DVCPRO50 being a direct descendant. JVC developed the competing D9/Digital-S format, which compresses video data in a way similar to DVCPRO but uses a cassette similar to S-VHS media.\n\nThe introduction of HDTV video production necessitated a medium for storing high-definition video information. In 1997, Sony bumped its Betacam series up to HD with the HDCAM standard and its higher-end cousin HDCAM SR. Panasonic's competing format for cameras is based on DVCPRO and called DVCPRO HD. For VTR and archive use, Panasonic expanded the D-5 specification to store compressed HD streams and called it D-5 HD.\n\nThe first consumer videocassette recorders (VCR) were launched in 1971 (based around Sony U-matic technology). Philips entered the domestic market the following year with the N1500. Sony's Betamax (1975) and JVC's VHS (1976) created a mass-market for VCRs and the two competing systems battled the \"videotape format war\", which VHS ultimately won. In Europe Philips had developed the V2000 format, which did not find favour with the TV rental companies in the UK and lost out to VHS. At first VCRs were very expensive, but by the late 1980s the price had come down enough to make them affordable to a mainstream audience. Videocassettes finally made it possible for consumers to buy or rent a complete film and watch it at home whenever they wished, rather than simply catching it at a movie theater or having to wait until it was telecast. It also made it possible for a VCR owner to begin time-shifting the recording of films and other television programs straight from the transmission. This caused an enormous change in viewing practices, as one no longer had to wait for a repeat of a program that had been missed. The shift to home viewing also changed the movie industry's revenue streams, because home renting created an additional window of time in which a film could make money. In some cases, films that did only modestly in their theater releases went on to have strong performance in the rental market (e.g., cult films).\n\nVHS became the leading consumer tape format for home movies after the \"videotape format war\", though its follow-ups S-VHS, W-VHS and D-VHS never caught up in popularity. In early 2000's in the prerecorded video market, VHS began to be displaced by DVD. The DVD format has several advantages over VHS tape. A DVD is much better able to take repeated viewings than VHS tape, which can crack or break, which makes DVDs a better format from a rental store's perspective. As well, whereas a VHS tape can be erased if it is exposed to a rapidly changing magnetic field of sufficient strength, DVDs and other optical discs are not affected by magnetic fields. Even though DVDs do not have the problems of tapes, such as breakage of the tape or the cassette mechanism, DVDs can still be damaged by scratches. Another factor for movie rental stores is that DVDs are smaller and take less space to store. DVDs offer a number of advantages for the viewer: DVDs can support both standard 4x3 and widescreen 16x9 screen aspect ratios and DVDs can provide twice the video resolution of VHS. As well, a viewer who wants to skip ahead to the end of a movie can do so much faster with a DVD than with a VHS tape (which has to be rewound). DVDs can have interactive menus, multiple language tracks, audio commentaries, Closed Captioning and subtitling (with the option of turning the subtitles on or off, or selecting subtitles in several languages). Moreover, a DVD can be played on a computer.\n\nDue to these advantages, by the mid-2000s, DVDs were the dominant form of prerecorded video movies in both the rental film and new movie markets. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, though, consumers continued to use VCRs to record over-the-air TV shows, because consumers could not make home recordings onto DVDs. This last barrier to DVD domination was broken in the late 2000s, with the advent of inexpensive DVD recorders and other digital video recorders (DVRs). DVR devices, which record shows onto a hard disk or flash storage, can be purchased from electronics stores or rented from cable or satellite TV providers. Despite the mainstream dominance of DVD, VHS continues to have a role. The conversion to DVD has led to the marketplace being flooded with used VHS films, which are available at pawnshops and second-hand stores, typically for a lower price than the equivalent film on a used DVD. As well, due to the large number of VHS players in schools and libraries, VHS tapes are still produced for the educational market. , at least one Public Library in the Detroit, Michigan area has discontinued lending out VHS prerecorded movies. In July 2016, the last known manufacturer of VCRs, Funai, announced that it was ceasing VCR production.\n\nEarly consumer camcorders used full-size VHS or Betamax cassettes. Later models switched to more compact formats, designed explicitly for smaller camcorder use, like VHS-C and Video8. VHS-C is a downsized version of VHS, using the same recording method and the same tape, but in a smaller cassette. It is possible to play VHS-C tapes in a regular VHS tape recorder by using an adapter. After Super VHS had appeared, a corresponding compact version, Super VHS-C, was released as well. Video8 is an indirect descendant of Betamax, using narrower tape and a smaller cassette. Because of its narrower tape and technical differences, it is not possible to develop an adapter from Video8 to Betamax. Video8 was later developed into Hi8, which provides better resolution similar to Super VHS.\n\nThe first consumer-level and lower-end professional (\"prosumer\") digital video recording format, introduced in 1995, used a smaller Digital Video Cassette (DVC). The format was later renamed MiniDV to reflect the DV encoding scheme, but the tapes still carry \"DVC\" mark. Some later formats like DVC Pro from Panasonic reflect the original name. The DVC/MiniDV format provides broadcast-quality video and sophisticated nonlinear editing capability on consumer and some professional equipment and has been used on many films, like Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later (2001, shot on a Canon XL1) and David Lynch's Inland Empire (2006, shot on a Sony PD170)\n\nIn 1999 Sony backported the DV recording scheme to 8-mm systems, creating Digital8. By using the same cassettes as Hi8, many Digital8 camcorders were able to play analog Video8/Hi8 recordings, preserving compatibility with already recorded analog video tapes. , Digital8 camcorders have been removed from the equipment offered by Sony.\n\nSony introduced another camcorder cassette format called MicroMV, but consumer interest was low due to the proprietary nature of the format and limited support for anything but low-end Windows video editors, and Sony shipped the last MicroMV unit in 2005. \nIn the late 2000s, MiniDV and its high-definition cousin, HDV, were the two most popular consumer/pro-sumer tape-based formats. The formats use different encoding methods, but the same cassette type. Since 2001, when MicroMV was presented, no new tape form factors have been introduced - with HDV (High Definition Video) offering consumers a bridge on HD video on MiniDV tape.\n\nWith advances in technology, videotape has moved past its original uses (original recording, editing, and broadcast playback) and is now primarily an archival medium. \nThe death of tape for video recording was predicted as early as 1995, when the Avid nonlinear editing system was demonstrated storing video clips on hard disks. Yet videotape was still used extensively, especially by consumers, up until about 2004, when DVD-based camcorders became affordable at consumer level and domestic computers had large enough hard drives to store an acceptable amount of video.\n\nConsumer camcorders have switched from being tape-based to tapeless machines that record video as computer files. Small hard disks and writable optical discs have been used, with solid-state memory such as SD cards being the current market leader. There are two primary advantages: First, copying a tape recording onto a computer or other video machine occurs in real time (e.g. a ten-minute video would take ten minutes to copy); since tapeless camcorders record video as computer-ready data files, the files can simply be copied onto a computer. Second, tapeless camcorders, and those using solid-state memory in particular, are far simpler mechanically and so are more reliable.\n\nDespite these conveniences, tape is still used extensively with filmmakers and television networks because of its longevity, low cost, and reliability. Master copies of visual content are often stored on tape for these reasons, particularly by users who cannot afford to move to tapeless machines. Professional users such as broadcast television were still using tape heavily in the mid- to late 2000s, but tapeless formats like DVCPRO P2, XDCAM and AVCHD, are gaining broader acceptance.\n\nWhile live recording has migrated to solid state (Panasonic P2, Sony SR MASTER or XDCAM-EX), optical disc (Sony's XDCAM) and hard disks, the high cost of solid state and the limited shelf life of hard-disk drives make them less desirable for archival use, for which tape is still used. , some news and production camera crews still have cameras that use tape formats, even in HD.\n\n"}

The station played a significant role in beaming taped Yoruba traveling theatre productions to households. \n\nIn 1975, the Federal Government of Nigeria established Nigerian Television Authority network service and acquired all T.V. stations in Nigeria to form the network. WNTS then became NTA Ibadan. \n\nWNTS was created as a partnership between the Western regional government and a foreign firm. It was designed to be an educational tool for the masses and also a medium to beam local culture, foreign news and aims of the government to the homes of people in the region. Establishment of the station was enhanced by the a constitutional change which removed broadcasting from an exclusive item to a concurrent item and political resolution of the regional premier, Obafemi Awolowo and the regional minister of Information, Anthony Enahoro. WNTV was a partnership between Overseas Rediffusion and the Western regional government. \n\nThe first television broadcast was on October 31, 1959. In 1962, the government parted ways with its foreign partner, WNTV solely came under the control of the regional government. The change in ownership structure from a mixture of social and commercial interest to solely social and political interest made WNTV an organ of government information and tool of the party in power. News programs such as WNTV News, \"Highlight\" were the ratings powerhouse of the station. Between 1959 and 1964, imported dramas dominated programming and reruns of children shows such as \"Adventures of Robin Hood\", \"Cisco Kid\", \"Hop Along Cassidy\" were popular among children. \n\nBeginning in 1962, the station increased audience through outreach programs in rural areas and schools starting with Omi-Adio Lalupon TV viewing project where tv sets powered by generators where purchased for joint viewing at rural community centers. The station had two educative programs that were well received \"News and You\", a current affairs discussion program produced by Christopher Kolade and the Ministry of Education and \"Careers\", a show that featured people in their various occupations. During this period there was little measurable statistics but the station played a pivotal role of promoting Yoruba traveling theatre. It taped and beamedDuro Ladipo's play including Ọba kò so for television viewing and a popular series \"Bode Waasimi\". In the 1970s, it broadcast popular shows like \"Alawada\" by the Alawada Group that included Moses Olaiya also known as Baba Sala. In 1976, \"Kootu Asipa\" by Duro Ladipo was a popular drama.\n"}

His works address the themes of the invisible world and spirituality, religions and pagan (notably Celtic) beliefs, fables and legends, and the fantastic.\n\nHis first investigative essay, published in 1987 by Ramsay, was dedicated to the literary journalist Bernard Pivot. Favourably received, it was qualified by Philippe Schuwer in \"Communication et Langages\" as « a study that approaches hagiography without having the faults ». Édouard Brasey thereupon interested himself in the esoteric with l’\"Enquête sur l'existence des Anges Rebelles\" in 1995 and the \"Enquête sur l'Existence des Fées et des Esprits de la Nature\" in 1996, published by Filipacchi and J’ai Lu.\n\nIn 1995, the writer specialised in the domain of legends, notably following an apprenticeship with the story-teller Henri Gougaud.

He authored numerous publications in this domain.\n\nHe has also published twelve novels since 1994, in the fields of thriller, crime novel, historical novel or story inspired by legend.\n\nIn \"Le Dernier Pape\" (\"The Last Pope\", Éditions Télémaque 2013, Amazon Kindle e-book 2012 and 2014), the pope is dead. While the pretenders to his succession intrigue in the corridors of the Vatican, gruesomely bloody ritual murders profane places of worship, an atrocious homage to the martyrdom of Saint Peter. Two thousand years ago, the apostle cast on Rome, the place of his torture, a curse that seems ready to accomplish its purpose: a cosmic menace is about to eliminate the seat of Christianity.\n\nThis esoteric thriller is inspired notably by the prophecy of Malachie, and the prophecy of the third secret of Fátima. \nÉdouard Brasey published Le Dernier Pape in March 2012 in electronic format at Amazon under the title \"La Prophétie de Pierre\", generating 3000 downloads in three months.

The book is regularly classified among the best-sellers in electronic format on the platforms Amazon.com and Amazon.fr., the new edition generated more than 2000 downloads in two months.\n\nFor Israel Hayom, Edouard Brasey, “a science-fiction writer known for penning thrillers”, this novel is eerily similar to the real-life events unfolding in the Vatican. The book’s protagonist is a pope who finds himself in the middle of numerous scandals, yet even a sci-fi guru like Brasey couldn’t stretch his imagination to the point where he envisioned the pontiff resigning from his post [...] I wrote this book in 2011 amidst all of the scandals that were being discussed at the time, and which were vividly manifest this past summer with the Vatileaks affair\". The newspaper insists of the fact that “Brasey, a former journalist, was the most sought-after pundit in France this week. Everyone wondered how he managed to sniff out such a significant scoop and present his readers with the story of a troubled pope, so similar to real life. (…)”\n\nCorine Pirozzi, \"The Huffington Post\", tells that \"Édouard Brasey entices us into an adventure totally captivating, fascinating in its occult accents and gives birth to an esoteric thriller of high quality\". \"Édouard Brasey has just published a book that presents strange coincidences with actual events at the Vatican. Ex-journalist converted to writing fantastic novels, Édouard Brasey has not given up getting scoops.\" Philippe Vallet, on the radio France Info, February 3, 2013, think that \"The Vatican will always light up the imagination of novelists. Witness Edouard Brasey who has published (…) a thriller which mixes the illness of a Pope, the intrigues for his succession, senseless murders and a cosmic menace. A novel researched and fascinating.\"\nFor Julie Malaure, « Quand le pape se meurt », Le Point, January 31, 2013 \"those who (…) thrill with excitement at each revelation made about the Vatican, who twitch at the evocation of secrets that deliberately obscure the Church, will find a great pleasure of reading in this esoteric thriller. Because the prolix Brasey (…) here shows all his generosity.\" Franck Ferrand of Europe 1 sees this novel as \"written exactly in the line of Anges et Démons by Dan Brown\". He salutes the action scenes and the numerous references, the \"Renaissance décor of Saint Peter and the Vatican\" alternating with \"ultra-modernity\", adding only the overall impression and inspiration « \"conspirator\", but only \"that which is proper to all these big novels. We are squarely in a conspiracy theory\".\n\nLes Lavandières de Brocéliande (Editions Calmann-Lévy, 2012, Le Livre de Poche, 2014). With Les Lavandières de Brocéliande, Edouard Brasey inaugurates a new genre, that of historic and legendary novels of the earth, inspired by popular beliefs, in which the action takes place in Brittany: during All-Saints Day, 1943, Gwenn, a young orphan, discovers one of her fellows, a washerwoman, drowned in the washing basin of Concoret, a small village on the edge of the forest of Brocéliande. Dahud, the oldest inhabitant, and mother of the victim, incriminates the washerwomen of the night, these supernatural creatures that, according to Breton legends, wash the bloody clothes of their still-born infants. The malediction continues to haunt the washerwomen of Brocéliande. This novel has been favourably received by Le Courrier Indépendant. it's followed with \"Les Pardons de Locronan\" and \"La Sirène d'Ouessant\" His next novel, due to appear with Calmann-Lévy in 2015, is a crime novel in which the action takes place in Haute Provence at the beginning of the 1960s, \"L’Affaire de la Cabre d’Or\".\n\nOn June 20, 2009, Édouard Brasey received the Prix Merlin in the novels category for \"Les Chants de la Walkyrie\", the first volume of the cycle \"La Malédiction de l’Anneau\" (Belfond editions, 2008 - 2010). He received a bursary for creation from the Centre National du Livre for his writing. Valeurs Actuelles writes that \"Édouard Brasey makes the ancient Nordic sagas sing, the legend of the powerful Ases and the magnificent Vanes. A remarkable work that holds together a fantastic narrative and lyric poetry\". For Nicolas L., SciFi-Universe, November 24, 2008 \"eminent French specialist in the universe of fairies, folklore, myths and legends, Édouard Brasey offers us, with La Malédiction de l'Anneau, the fruit of a colossal work of compilation carried out from diverse sources, such as l'Edda, La Saga des Völsung or l'Anneau du Nibelung.\" Plume-libre.com insists on the \"titanic work where we sense the love of Édouard Brasey for all that touches from near or from far the imaginary and the fantastic, to take on such a monster might seem a little reckless but the author knew how to respond to the challenge with brio and brings us a new insight into a myth that has not finished making us dream.\"\n\n\"L’Encyclopédie du Merveilleux\" (Editions Le Pré aux Clercs, 2005, 2006, 2007 et 2012) collects more than creatures of surnatural world: fairies, elves, imps, mermaids, dwarfs, dragons, unicorns, griffons, gargoyles, werewolves, vampires trolls, Cyclopes, giants, ogres, titans… with their description, their geographic and mythological origin, their habits and their history.

The first volume has been translated into English by Five Mile Press, under the title The Encyclopedia of Fantasy – People of Light. More than 100 000 copies of this work were sold, all editions included. These works, accessible to all, have improved the knowledge of the marvellous in France. Jacques Baudou, Le Monde, October 21, 2005, writes \"Re-enchant the world\": this slogan, borrowed from the preface of this encyclopaedia, entitled \"Once upon a time it was marvellous\", could well define better than a long discussion the task engaged here and which must be followed to its conclusion in several volumes.\" For Le Figaro, \"Édouard Brasey is a major specialist of the genre. \"\n\n\"Démons et Merveilles\" (Éditions Le Chêne 2002, 2006 and 2010), \"Faeries and Demons\" (Barnes & Noble, New-York, 2003), \"Dragons, Little People, Witches, Fairies, Trolls and Elves\" (Hachette UK Illustrated, London, 2003).
