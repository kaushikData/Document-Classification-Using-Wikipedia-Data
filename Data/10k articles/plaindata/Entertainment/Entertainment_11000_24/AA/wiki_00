{"id": "6447554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6447554", "title": "After Dark (magazine)", "text": "After Dark (magazine)\n\nAfter Dark was an entertainment magazine that covered theatre, cinema, stage plays, ballet, performance art, and various artists, including singers, actors and actresses, and dancers, among others. First published in May 1968, the magazine succeeded \"Ballroom Dance Magazine\". In the late 1970s Patrick Pacheco took over the editorship from William Como and strived for a time to make the magazine a more serious critical monthly with a greater emphasis on quality writing, abandoning color printing inside and reducing photos to a few inches square. This was a reaction to Como's \"eye-candy\" thrust, but sales were low and in 1981 Louis Miele replaced him at the helm and returned to the full-color format with plenty of skin on show. It seemed however that the day was done for \"After Dark\", perhaps because several newer magazines were now doing a better (and more explicitly targeted) job of appealing to the magazine's original readership, for Miele's incarnation of \"After Dark\" folded after only a couple of years, this time permanently.\n\nThe first issue does not say \"Volume 1, no. 1\", it says \"Volume 10, no. 1\". This numbering continues through volume 13, no. 8, Dec. 1970, which is followed by volume 3, no. 9, Jan. 1971. (Volume 3 is thus actually the fourth volume.)\n\n\"After Dark\", founded by its first editor, William Como, and Rudolph Orthwine (both of \"Dance Magazine\"), covered a wide range of entertainment- or lifestyle-related topics. In addition to numerous articles on dance, topics ranged from a review of the stage production of the musical \"Hair\" in the December 1968 issue and an article on Shirley Bassey in the January 1972 issue, to a cover photograph and feature article on Donna Summer in the April 1977 issue.\n\nOther cover photos included Bette Midler (January 1973), Robert Redford (December 1973), Barbra Streisand (April 1975), Lauren Hutton (December 1976), Mae West (May 1977), Peter Allen (February 1978), Dolly Parton (April 1978), Jon Voight (April 1979), Christopher Reeve (October 1980), Lily Tomlin (February 1981), and Diana Ross (May 1981). Best sold issue was the February 1976 Issue with Zarko Halmic, Bonita George and Bo van den Assum on the cover.\n\nThe May 1979 issue contained a profile of actor Philip Anglim, who originated the role on Broadway of John Merrick in \"The Elephant Man\", a play by Bernard Pomerance. Two other profiles in that issue were of James Mason, the actor who was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as the husband of Judy Garland in the film \"A Star Is Born\" and Marilyn Hassett, who portrayed Jill Kinmont in \"The Other Side of the Mountain\", a film about skier Kinmont's accident that left her paralyzed.\n\nIssues regularly contained features on fashion; at times articles were about men's fashion exclusively. The \"Cityscapes\" section contained brief articles about then-current items of note in various cities or other geographical areas worldwide, for example, London; Toronto; San Francisco; Los Angeles; Las Vegas; Birmingham, Alabama; Kansas; New Jersey; Washington, D.C.; and Miami.\n\nFor its advertising space promotion in the February 1977 issue of the magazine, \"After Dark\" touted,\n\nTheir profile of their readers stated that 85.2% of their readers were single, were a median age of 33.7, and had a median income of . They were \"upscale\", with 75.8% holding managerial or professional positions, well-groomed—76.4% used cologne—and spent a year on clothing. Their readers were \"Travel Minded\": taking a median 3.5 vacations per year with 56.6% owning valid passports; and \"Bon Vivant\": 81.6% regularly drinking vodka, 81.3% scotch, 70.3% gin, 63.5% champagne.\n\nThe magazine contained substantial advertising for gay restaurants, accommodations, nightclubs, bathhouses, guides, books, pornographic movies, and other products. Some of the advertising was not overtly gay; however, much of the advertising was for establishments or products that were well-known to gay men, or contained symbols often used to identify gay-oriented material, such as the Greek letter \"lambda\". There was also an abundance of advertising for men's boutiques and clothing companies, especially those—such as International Male, for example—that offered skimpy men's underwear or swimwear.\n\nAdvertising for other products or services for gay men was explicit; for example, the ads for Hand in Hand Video, a gay pornography studio; \"The David Kopay Story\", regarding former professional football player David Kopay's homosexuality; and an ad for books by noted gay author Paul Monette, \"The Gold Diggers\" (containing the tag line, \"Glittering, Glamorous, Gay\"), and \"Lovers: The Story of Two Men\", by Michael Denneny, described in the ad as \"A poignantly true love story, with photographs\".\n\nThe May 1979 issue included an ad for an organization simply identified as \"GSF\" titled, \"No Man Should Be Without A Man!\", which stated, \"If you would like to meet warm, sincere gay men (and women) who are interesting in forming...relationships then it's time you find out about GSF.\" The issue also included an ad in its \"After Dark Classified\" ads for a \"Gay Astrologer\".\n\nOther advertising was obviously intended for adult readers as well, presumably those with open minds. The February 1977 issue contained a half-page ad for the Harry Reems Legal Defense Fund. The ad appealed for funds for Reems' defense in two separate lawsuits for his participation in the pornographic films \"Deep Throat\" and \"The Devil in Miss Jones.\n\nDaniel Harris describes the founding of \"After Dark\" as\n\nAlthough not described as a \"gay magazine\", \"After Dark\" regularly covered topics of interest to the gay community. Cal Culver, better known as the gay porn star Casey Donovan, appeared on the cover of the December 1972 issue. The February 1975 issue included a photographic portfolio of the gay porn star Peter Berlin. At its height, the magazine had more than 300,000 readers, \"composed almost exclusively of gay men,\" according to Daniel Harris.\n\nThe May 1979 issue included a feature article on the G.G. Barnum's Room, a New York City alternative nightclub catering to a gay and transvestite clientele. The feature article included information about the evolution / genesis of the club and the makeup of its then-current customers. The feature also contained a tandem piece on rollerskating disco, \"Boogie on Wheels\".\n\nThe magazine publishers acknowledged the magazine's appeal to the gay community, noting that the magazine \"had gotten a following in the homosexual community seven or eight years before any of the current homosexual magazines came on the market.\"\n\nDonald Embinder, a former advertising salesman for \"After Dark\", went on to found \"Blueboy\", an upscale adult magazine which has been called the gay answer to such straight titles as \"Playboy\" and \"Penthouse\".\n\nThe magazine, intentionally or not, provided a level of homoeroticism by regularly using images of nude or partially nude men for its cover and article illustrations. Although some illustrations of partially clad or nude women were included at times, males comprised the majority of the subjects. Some of the illustrations related directly to the subject of the article, but others seemed to be used just for their nudity or partial nudity.\n\nA feature article in the February 1977 issue, \"Musclebound for Glory\", contained photos of bodybuilders, thus relating the illustrations directly to the topic of the article. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the cover model for that issue and several photographs of him were used as illustrations in the article. In two photographs, he appears in the nude; one photograph shows part of his penis. The feature is an in-depth look at bodybuilding as \"one of the most fascinating (and least explored) subcultures in America.\" Illustrated with pictures of barely clothed bodybuilders, the article, intentionally or not, evokes homoeroticism.\n\nOne photograph in that issue that seems to use gratuitous nudity is one of actor Paul Charles, performing the role of \"Mark\" on Broadway in the musical \"A Chorus Line\". The illustration is one of several for an article about current events on Broadway, and consists of a narrative text as well as photographs of performers with brief summaries of their productions in the captions of the photos. Charles is photographed nude with a fur coat strategically draped over one shoulder that just covers his groin.\n\n\n Burrell, Devine, and Ralph appeared on the January 1982 cover together\n"}

The park covers 46.7 hectares and is located in the southwestern Fengtai District of Beijing. It is about 17 km from Tiananmen, the City center, and 40 km from the Capital International Airport. The park opened in 1993 and is estimated to receive 1.5 million visitors annually.\n\nThe entrance to the park is made up of a Gothic castle, Roman corridor, and granite relief sculptures. Immediately inside the gate is an Italian-style terrace garden with grand staircases, fountains, and sculptures inspired by originals from the European Renaissance. More lawns and gardens are scattered throughout the park. On these lawns are miniature models of around 100 of the world’s most famous statues including the American Statue of Liberty, Copenhagen’s Little Mermaid, Michelangelo’s David, and the Venus de Milo. Once inside the gates, Beijing World Park consists of two main parts: the scenic portion and the shopping, dining, and entertainment area.\n\nThe scenic area of the park models itself after the naturalistic layout of the globe, representing the four major oceans, and focusing on five continents: Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and South America. The park contains about a hundred (109) scaled-down replicas of famous landmarks from nearly 40 countries and regions around the world, including the Tower Bridge in London, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and the Great Pyramids in Egypt. There is even a miniature Manhattan, complete with twin towers of the World Trade Center. Each landmark represents its country or region of origin and is situated in the park according to its location on the map.\n\nClose attention to detail was paid in modeling these landmarks after their originals. For example, detailed carvings and ornamentations are included. Even the materials used are modeled after their originals to create the most authentic look possible. For example, the replica of the Great Pyramids was constructed of 200,000 white marble bricks, each as large as a bar of soap. Red Square in Russia, is replicated by paving the smaller model in World Park with over 5 million red bricks smaller than mahjong tiles.\n\n\nMany of the locale-specific areas focused on the five continents also include live entertainment or some kind of an immersive cultural experience such as a dance performance or parade based on customs from their culture of origin. There is a special garden area in the scenic portion of the park that consists of China's Qingyingjing Park, Japan's Katsura Imperial Villa, and an American-style garden villa. This allows visitors to see global styles of gardening. To get around the park, visitors can travel the four “oceans” by speedboat tour. They can also take a monorail that circumvents the five continents to give tourists a glimpse of the whole “world”. Or they can take a tour of the park in battery-operated cars.\n\nThe other portion of the park includes the shopping and dining area. This area is modeled after Euro-American architecture. The various establishments allow visitors to purchase souvenirs and sample cuisine from the countries and regions represented in the scenic portion of the park. This second part of the park also includes the entertainment area where grand spectacles and cinema features take place in large theatres to showcase global cultural costume, movement, and customs. Some of these cultural activities include the daily opening ceremonies, which consist of a parade of large-scale floats. There are also culture-specific folklore dances that take place indoors or in open-air arenas. These dances may be performed by Beijing World Park dancers, or they may be performed by troupes representing their local cultures. In 2005 the Park even hosted a Thai elephant that performed four times a day from May to October.\n\nDuring the 2008 Summer Olympics, it was selected as one of the three protest zones.\n\n\"The World\" is a 2004 film directed by Jia Zhangke, which was made at Beijing World Park and focused on the lives of some fictional park employees.\n\nThe Beijing Dabaotai Western Han Dynasty Mausoleum is located southeast from the south entrance of the World Park. The mausoleum hosts the 2,000-year-old tombs of a Western Han dynasty prince and his wife.\n\n\n"}

According to American National Public Radio, the theater features a \"shiny\" lobby with a snack bar.\n\nFormer theater manager Farouk Masri told journalists that his family had decided that the political situation had calmed sufficiently to make building a modern movie house profitable in a city that had lacked one for many years. \"It's been missing from Nablus, the cinema houses, been missing since the first intifada, over 20 years.\" He said that the new cinema was, \"The talk of the street, I keep hearing ... Everybody is just excited, they're very positive about it, and they're very supportive\". Among the excited children in the audience were many who had never seen a movie shown in real theater, only on the small screens of televisions and video players.\n\nRelaxed checkpoint rules mean that Arabs from many towns can come to Nablus for shopping, dining and movies.

{"id": "494165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=494165", "title": "Closing credits", "text": "Closing credits\n\nClosing credits or end credits are a list of the cast and crew of a particular motion picture, television program, or video game. Where opening credits appear at the beginning of a work, closing credits appear close to, or at the very end of a work. A full set of credits can include the cast and crew, but also production sponsors, distribution companies, works of music licensed or written for the work, various legal disclaimers, such as copyright and more. Some long-running productions list \"production babies\".\n\nTypically, the closing credits are typed and appear in white lettering on a solid black background, featuring no sound effects or dialogue, only a musical background, sometimes the works' theme music. Credits are either static and flip from page to page, or scroll as a single list from the bottom of the screen to the top. Occasionally closing credits will divert from this standard form to scroll in another direction, include illustrations, extra scenes, bloopers, joke credits, or post-credits scenes.\n\nThe use of closing credits in film to list complete production crew and cast was not firmly established in American film until the 1970s. Before this decade, most movies were released with no closing credits at all. Films generally had opening credits only, which consisted of just major cast and crew, although sometimes the names of the cast and the characters they played would be shown at the end, as in \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Mary Poppins\", \"Oliver!\" and the 1964 \"Fail Safe\". Two of the first major films to contain extensive closing credits – but almost no opening credits – were the blockbusters \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956) and \"West Side Story\" (1961). \"West Side Story\" showed only the title at the beginning of the film, and \"Around the World in 80 Days\" had no opening credits at all.\n\n\"Around the World in 80 Days\" had one of the longest and most elaborate closing credit sequences of any film. The credits took around seven minutes to finish. It provided an animated recap of the movie's three-hour storyline, identifying the actors in the order in which they appeared. \"Superman\" (1978) also had a very long closing credits sequence, which took nearly eight minutes to end, and was the longest end credits sequence ever recorded at the time of the film's release. \n\nSome live action/animated films' end credits later ran from seven to eight minutes in length, such as \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988) \"Space Jam\" (1996), \"Scooby-Doo\" (2002) and \"The Lego Movie\" (2014). \nThe 2016 movie \"Assassin's Creed\" end credits extends for almost 15 minutes.\n\nThe British television series \"Spooks\" does not feature any credits, as a result of a decision made by the producers to add to the anonymity of the show's content (about the British Security Service). Instead, the credits appear as a special feature on the series DVDs, and also on the official website. Similarly, the British series \"Jam\" (2000) features a single title at the end of each episode reading only \"jamcredits.com\".\n\nSome closing credits include out-takes. Sometimes a parting scene is edited in after the credits conclude as a final joke. For example, in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", Ferris appears and breaks the fourth wall to say \"You're still here? ... It's over! Go home!\" The Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker films have included spoof production members, credits unrelated to the movie (\"Author of \"A Tale of Two Cities\" – Charles Dickens\"), cooking recipes and song lyrics in their closing credits, while Monty Python films have included credits for ridiculous and non-existent production staff. On some occasions, the filmmakers will have a character come back and pop in during the credits to see the goings-on (a noted example is \"Finding Nemo\", in which several characters interact with the credits as if they were physical objects). In certain special episodes of the motoring show \"Top Gear\", the credits are comedically altered in ways appropriate to the episode: for example, in the American special, the first names of all the cast and crew were listed as \"Billy Bob\". The \"South Park\" episode \"Trapped in the Closet\" featured altered credits after the episode, critical of Scientology, ends with Stan Marsh yelling \"Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!\" The credits then list every member of every position as either \"John\" or \"Jane Smith\". Another noteworthy example is Daffy Duck appearing in the credits of \"\" complaining about how long they run. On other occasions additional scenes to advance the storyline (such as in \"Wild Things\" and \"\"), influence or guide the viewers to a possible outcome of the film's conclusion (such as in \"WALL-E\" or The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie) or set up sequels (such as in \"Transformers\" and \"Iron Man\") may occur after the credits roll. In the case of \"Rebuild of Evangelion\", additional scenes are included that serve all three purposes, including ones in the style of the whimsically narrated \"previews\" from the television series that the films were based on. The closing credits for the extended edition of \"\" have sketches of the characters and the actors who portrayed them.\n\nSometimes the closing credits of comedic films include footage of bloopers that occurred during production. Most Jackie Chan movies include these. The practice was parodied in the Pixar films \"A Bug's Life\", \"Toy Story 2\", and \"Monsters, Inc.\" which feature specially-animated bloopers that portray the films' animated characters as actors who make mistakes.\n\nOn Father's Day, \"Big Brother UK\" credits everyone using their father's name. For example, Steve Jones would be billed as \"Adam Jones' son\". The 2006 film \"Clerks 2\" by Kevin Smith features an extended closing credits that included a list of anyone who joined Smith's \"friends network\" on MySpace in the months building up to the film's release. The very long list of credits (in multi-column format) has forced some theaters to either stop the projector early or to cut out sections of the film reel so that the theater could be cleaned in time for the following showing. Upon the film's release, Smith announced that he would continue the MySpace friends credit list through 2006 and would include any new names on the DVD credits when the film is released on DVD, which he did. On the 1969–1974 version of \"Beat the Clock\", the closing credits were known as a \"boss list\": the executive producer, for example, was the \"Super Boss\", the producer, \"Boss\", the stunt coordinator \"Stunt Boss\" and the host's assistant \"Pretty Girl Boss\".\n\nOn American television, the time the viewers spent watching the closing credit roll was often considered an opportunity to promote other shows on the network. Typically, this was accomplished by lowering the volume of or muting the closing music while a continuity announcer on voice-over pitched another program – each continuity announcer would often remind the viewer to \"stay tuned\" for the following show. Examples included Ernie Anderson on ABC, Alan Kalter on USA Network until 1996, Phil Tonken on WOR-TV (now WWOR-TV) in New York City, and various Cartoon Network voiceovers on Cartoon Network until 2008. To help avoid cacophony with the theme song, most American television series produced since 1970 had few, if any, vocals in the closing music. As technology advanced, however, networks decided to replace the voice-overs with full-blown visual promos. Before the 1970s, there are many sponsor logos/tags that were featured in their end credits on their original network broadcast runs.\n\nIn the U.S., networks now run a split-screened version of the show's credits to allow for running a promo (known in some circles as \"generic credits\", \"split-screen credits\", \"squeezed credits\" or \"credit crunch\"). NBC started this practice in the fall of 1994 with a strategy called \"NBC 2000,\" which was designed to keep viewers from channel-surfing. All NBC shows used this practice, except for \"Days of Our Lives\", which would switch in 2001. At that time, the credits were displayed on the right side of the screen, using a typeface on all shows that differs from the one used in the actual closing credits of each individual program (hence the common nickname \"generic credits\"), with \"promo-tainment\" (vintage scenes, trivia questions, etc.) on the left side or, for shows like \"Friends\", \"Mad About You\", \"Seinfeld\", \"Frasier\", or \"Will & Grace\" (starting sometime around the third season), a tag sequence. Shortly after its adoption, the network shifted from \"promo-tainment\" to just airing promos for other NBC programming. All five major commercial broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW) use this format; in mid-2004, Fox was the first major network to shift its credits to the lower one-quarter of the screen, and by the end of that year, ABC and NBC followed suit. In 2005, CBS, The WB, UPN (and, when it launched the following year, The CW) began shifting credits to the lower quarter of the screen. By the early 2000s, the use of \"generic credits\" began to spread to cable; most channels owned by the MTV Networks unit of Viacom (including MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central), Lifetime and Lifetime Movie Network (though in June 2011, it was abandoned on their movies and scripted drama series, in favor of showing the original studio credits on the lower half of the screen), BBC America and (on certain syndicated programs and films) ABC Family began using this type of format. Since 2009, premium television service Showtime also uses generic closing credits on its original series, and is the only premium channel to use this format. Some of the aforementioned cable channels, particularly the Nickelodeon channels (except Nick Jr.) and until recently ABC Family have removed tag scenes or blooper reels originally featured during the show's end credits, replacing them with marginalized credits to air promos for other network programming.\nCBS later adapted this practice, replacing tag sequences (for its sitcoms) with promos beginning the January of 1995. When ABC adapted this practice in the fall of 1995, they first use the promo on top and the show's logo with the roll on the bottom, except for sitcoms (barring \"Coach\" and \"The Jeff Foxworthy Show\", which used split-screen credits), but starting in the fall of 1996, all ABC sitcoms started using the trend. In the case of \"Seinfeld\" on NBC, they used the West-Shapiro and Castle Rock cards after the credits, as opposite to other NBC shows, which used the studio logo cards before the credits.\n\nOn some shows, the credits are reduced to either a rapid-fire crawl, or quick-flashing cards; in some cases, each credit would appear on-screen for less than one second (a prime example is at the end of each episode of \"Survivor\", in which there is a rapid credit-crawl to fit in all of the contestant's closing speech). Sometimes a promo would run shorter of the normal time it would take to run the credits at normal speed. Thus, the credits even \"sped-up\" near the end in order to show all the credits before the promo ended (a prime example of this is NBC's showing of \"Titanic\", in which there were so many credits to be shown in so little time that credits switched almost every frame, making it impossible for anyone to read, even with a slow motion capability – and \"The Biggest Loser\", particularly during the season finale episodes). Starting with the 2004 season, ABC air their closing credits of its sitcoms at the bottom of the screen, during the closing scene in a format that keeps in-line with the network's generic credits look. These credits, however, air without the dark-colored bar that airs during their other prime-time programs, except for promotional consideration tags that appear near the end of the credits. In other words, the credits are superimposed over the closing scene's action in the same manner as the original studio credits.\n\nMost daytime soap operas used closing credits for many years. Most of the shows aired during the week (e.g., Monday through Thursday) would list just the main people involved with the production and a few of the principal actors and actresses. However, given the large number of people involved with the production of each serial, a full cast and crew credit crawl could last three minutes or longer. Because of this, an expanded credit roll would often air at least once a week, such as on the Friday show, with the closing theme often an expanded version of the show's opening music. Starting in 1999, soap operas began eliminating the full-screen crawl in favor of the one-third screen credits/promo combination. While NBC, ABC and CBS soaps all use the upper portion of the screen to show advertisements for primetime programming, ABC soaps showed previews for the next episode until 2008 and intermittently since then (the network's lone remaining soap, \"General Hospital\", currently runs an episode preview during the end credits). In comparison, daytime soaps rerun on SOAPnet until the channel shut down in 2013 continued to use full-screen credits. Around Christmas time, ABC soaps formerly aired holiday-themed credits, which do not feature network promotions; \"One Life to Live\", in particular, scrolled the credits over a shot of a lighted Christmas tree (this practice ended around 2011). CBS soaps also air holiday-themed credits that also do not feature network promotions; most of their airings are \"classic\" airings from previous years, and the credits usually include a fully decorated Christmas tree, a fire burning in the fireplace in the background, etc., complete with random Christmas music and ending with the cast breaking the fourth wall with a holiday greeting (since the late 2000s, the latter element has been typically played as a separate epilogue before the credit sequence, while all of the other mentioned elements have been dropped).\n\nDaytime game shows worked in much the same vein as soap operas. A shorter version might list one or two people involved with the production, along with such plugs as for prizes and wardrobe providers. At least once a week, a full-length credit roll would air over the extended main theme (along with camera shots of such things as the contestant talking with the host and/or celebrities). By the mid-1990s, \"The Price Is Right\" was the lone daytime game show remaining, and it would eventually switch to marginalized credits, starting in the fall of 1999. Game shows that have the full closing credits that do not scroll up include \"Go\", \"The New $25,000 Pyramid\", both the Dick Clark and John Davidson versions of \"The $100,000 Pyramid\", the original versions of \"Beat the Clock\", \"To Tell the Truth\", \"Password\", \"What's My Line?\", the Bill Cullen version of \"The Price is Right\" and the original Mike Adamle version of \"American Gladiators\" from the second half of the first season to the end of the series run. The original \"Match Game\" had the credits scrolling up at the bottom of the screen; the 1970s version of \"Match Game\" had the credits scrolling up bottom-to-top during \"Match Game '73\" and right-to-left starting with \"Match Game '74\" and including \"Match Game PM\" and the syndicated version from 1979 to 1982. Goodson-Todman's \"Double Dare\" placed the credits on the main game board to show off the then state-of-the-art electronic display board. Sometimes on that show, the camera zoomed into the game board before the credits began. On the original daytime \"Wheel of Fortune\" in the 1970s and 1980s as well as the first few seasons of the nighttime Wheel, the credits always began with a list of sponsors over a shot of the Wheel.\n\nSome cable channels have used credits to blur the lines between the end of one show and the beginning of the following program. TNT and TBS had formerly run the program's end credits in small (sometimes illegible) type at the bottom of the screen while another episode of the same program began at about three-quarters height. Similarly on networks like E! and formerly Style Network, the program-to-program transition is seamless; to do this, the networks have moved the closing credits for their programs to air within the first minute of a show, usually on the bottom 1/3 of the screen in small, translucent type. For E!, the closing credits for the program being seen at that moment is seen at the start of that program; for other networks that use this practice, whether they use a double-box or generic credit format, the closing credits for the preceding program is seen during the opening of the next program. A few networks such as Nick at Nite, Comedy Central, Logo and TV Land have even moved the production company cards (displayed in a small box) in their network-generated credits (in the case of Nick at Nite from 2010 to 2011, this was done only when the generic closing credits are shown at the beginning of an episode of a show during back-to-back airings of most series, while a promo/generic credit combo followed by the production company credits are shown at the end of the last episode of a show's back-to-back block; this is now the common parlance since 2012 as the credits are now superimposed over the final scene of the episode for certain programs).\n\nOften, the network-to-local transition between the end of the network primetime schedule and late local news on broadcast networks will feature the network show credits on the bottom of the screen, while the local news teaser sequence, station identification, news opening, and then the top story will take place. Once the credits end, the local news broadcast zooms in to fill the screen, creating a seamless hand-off. Despite some objections by television production unions, some programs, such as those that air on Discovery Networks and the U.S. version of the National Geographic Channel only air the credits during a program's premiere broadcast, referring viewers to a website to view the credits in subsequent broadcasts.\n\nSome networks, such as GSN, have even begun cutting off the credits before they finish, most likely to allow more time for commercials, though GSN has begun to squeeze the production company closing credits to the bottom third of the screen and show the entire credits during that time; Spike (only on its original programming and certain syndicated shows), Oxygen and Hallmark Channel also squeeze the production company credits to the lower third of the screen. Some cable channels mix use of generic and the actual production company credits depending on the show, ABC Family currently airs generic credits on most acquired programs where most episodes have no tag scene, while acquired programs where most episodes do feature one, the tag scene and/or production company credits are aired full-screen, and since June 2010, the channel's original series have the closing credits overlaid on the final scene of the episode (though these were separated in airings of their original programs via its website and VOD service until 2012).\n\nUntil CBS opted not to continue maintaining rights to the Hallmark Hall of Fame series in 2011, the original credits were aired; the ending promo would be shown first, then the original closing credits. When the Hallmark Hall of Fame moved to ABC in 2011 starting with the telecast of \"Have a Little Faith\", with the advent of ABC using generic credits on some television specials, the network began using marginalized closing credits being played concurrently with the ending promo; as a result, original closing credits are no longer seen on original airings, and must be first seen on the DVD release or the Hallmark Channel rebroadcast.\n\nAlso, UPN used the announcer overlapping studio's logo music and sounds over that logos before split-screen credits of UPN programming, except some programs which carried vanilla studio logos without voiceover.\n\nThe WB Television Network used the studio's logo music and sounds with no voiceover up until 2004. Fox Broadcasting Company did the same thing also up until at least 2001, with programming from 20th Century Fox Television using the studio's well-known opening drumroll over the Fox logo from 1997 to 2001. American Broadcasting Company did the same until 1998 when they adapted the iconic 4-note jingle.\n\nSteven Bochco's shows aired on their major networks featured Steven Bochco's own logo theme instead of generic music theme. The same can't be said for if a show is made by either David E. Kelley or Chris Carter, but at least Kelley used the \"You stinkah!\" logo card and its own music at all on split-screen credits of Kelley productions.\n\nFull closing credits are still created by the production company and are used in syndicated reruns of a program, and are always seen if the program is released as a DVD box set, is broadcast via video on demand or is streamed online via the network's website or websites such as Hulu or Netflix that specialize in airing television programs. For the latter, newer versions of each streaming provider's interfaces may encourage the continuous binge-watching of series, thus the credits (which are often extended with foreign dub localizations and subtitle providers also being acknowledged) are shrunk down to a smaller window locally, presenting the choice to watch credits in full, or go on to the next episode of a series or a new recommended film.\n\nMany animated shows still maintain and air the full version of the credits.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1994, CBS and from 1993 to 1996, ABC displayed the show's closing credits produced by the production company in a two-panel format, with the actual production credits chroma-keyed to shove to one side of the screen with a video promo for other network programming on the other side (CBS displayed the show's closing credits at the left and promo on the right of the screen in a two-panel format, while ABC displayed them in the reverse order with the promo taking up only one-quarter of the screen); since the late 2000s, there has been a trend of cable channels using this credit display format, usually shown in a vertical or (usually) horizontal double-box format similar to that used in television news to toss to and from field reports. Ion Television is the only commercial broadcast network using a double-box format; all others using this format are cable networks including Disney XD, Syfy, USA Network, WGN America, most of the Turner networks, such as TBS, TNT and at times Cartoon Network (Cartoon Network uses generic credits on some programs), during syndicated programming only on G4 and TruTV, and occasionally Viacom-owned Paramount Network (Paramount Network uses generic credits that are superimposed over the last scene of most programs and movies). In some cases, the show credits return to full-screen in time for the production company logos at the end of the credit sequence; though a few channels such as TNT and Cartoon Network do not shrink or expand the original closing credits from full-screen and back at any point during the credit sequence and a promo is shown along with the production company credits throughout.\n\nSpanish-language networks typically do not use generic credits or marginalize the credits for network promotion; however, during movies aired in prime time, Telemundo and UniMás do air promos while the closing credits as produced by the film's production company are scrolling, usually shown in the speed scroll commonly used for basic cable or broadcast syndication runs of films due to time constraints. Similar to the aforementioned program-to-program hand-off during the credits, TBS and TNT, as well as some A&E programs, presently show one program's original production credits, in a double-box style side-by-side with the next program's cold open; TBS does this only from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. and TNT from 6 a.m. to midnight Eastern Time, and a promo may be shown if the next program's episode starts with the opening credits immediately followed by a commercial break and the double-box credit format is done with movies airing outside of late night).\n\nChiller, Adult Swim, Up, TV One, Boomerang (excluding Primetime), and Viacom-owned Nick Jr. and Tr3́s do show the original program credits full-screen; TV One in particular often uses voice-overs to promote other programs. TeenNick (dating back to its existence as The N) also showed the closing credits full-screen on most shows that have a tag scene, though those that did not have a tag and a small few that did used the double-box format, though since July 2010, a generic credit sequence has been used on most programs, causing the elimination of tag scenes on a few programs.\n\nSince 2006, Disney Channel runs tag scenes during the closing credits on all of its original scripted programs including preschool and animated series; the channel also overlays the credits over the final scene in special airings of Disney XD's original live-action series, which are normally kept separate when aired on Disney XD; since the 2009 original movie \"\", the channel's original made-for-cable films also feature outtakes during the closing credits. Premium channels Showtime and Starz, as well as most basic cable channels, such as AMC and FX, have also squeezed down the standard production credits of some or all of their movies to the bottom half of the screen (usually starting about 15–25 seconds into the credits and ending anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes before the end of the credits) with the film credits running at normal speed in order to show behind-the-scenes features or network promos; HBO, Cinemax, Encore (since September 2009), Epix and The Movie Channel do not do this with any of their films. Starz and Encore are the only premium channels that promote original series and upcoming films with an info box that appears during the ending credits on their programming.\n\n\"American Idol\", \"America's Got Talent\", \"Dancing with the Stars\", \"So You Think You Can Dance\", \"The Voice\", and \"The X Factor\" are also exceptions, showing the full credits in a rapid-fire card format as the shows close (along with voting disclaimers).\n\nBetween 1995 and 1996, and again from 2008 and 2009, both ABC and Fox aired their sitcoms' closing credits in the shows' respective credit fonts, instead of the network generic font (excepting ABC's telecasts of \"Coach\" and \"The Jeff Foxworthy Show\"). Fox's airings of \"The Simpsons\" and \"Bob's Burgers\" also currently air full-screen (from 1996 to 2008, the network usually aired the voice credits for the actors and special guest voices full-screen before switching to generic credits for the rest of the roll).\n\nIn the United Kingdom all channels have their own variations in which way closing credits are presented. The five main networks rarely promote other shows and show the full original credits supplied with the show. In the early 2000s ITV adopted a practice similar to that of NBC 2000, generic credits to the right hand side of the screen with a promo running on the left. This then changed in 2007 when generic credits where flashed in a letterbox format using 1/4 of the lower half of the screen whilst promos ran across the top. Again similar to NBC. When the channel revamped years later they dropped this and have now gone back to a more 'old fashioned' presentation. Only some specific cable and satellite channels use a more American style credits/promo presentation but this varies greatly even on the same channel. This leads to viewers switching channels as the networks waste time airing full closing credits with no incentive to stay tuned. Some networks like the BBC also use a double-box format for the closing credits; the BBC has even laid out guidelines as to how the credits must be shown on its networks; closing credits must be shown at the center of the screen and be either separate cards or scroll vertically (percentage reduction testing in an editing suite is required in post-production to ensure readability), the BBC networks and other unrelated broadcast, cable and satellite channels in the United Kingdom such as Nickelodeon UK will squeeze and reduce the credits to 60% of their original size and crop them, returning them to full screen in time for the production company credits, in a manner similar to many of the aforementioned American cable channels.In Spain closing credits are never aired on any channel instead going straight to commercial break,straight into the next show or if airing the next episode of the same show there is a seamless transfer to this. Ens credits are also never aired at the end of movies. \n\nAfter the credits, it would just have the closing variant of the movie company which is a still version of it or a silent version or a short version. Sometimes, the MPAA screen would appear in the end. A black FBI Warning screen could appear in the end. In Universal Studios and 20th Century Fox films (up to 2010), and formerly New Line Cinema, Metro Goldwyn Mayer, and Lionsgate (formerly Artisan), the Deluxe Digital Studios or DVCC logo or any digital service logo would be shown. Many Universal films produced at Universal Studios in Hollywood or Orlando would have a plug for the studios, inviting moviegoers to visit; in the film \"Animal House\", this plug included a brief reminder to \"ask for Babs\", in reference to Delta House foe Babs Jansen, who, after the events in the film, was hired as a tour guide for Universal Studios in Hollywood.\n\nIf the credits are part of a television program, after the credits, the production company's and distributor's/channel's logo (and in some cases, their copyright notices and year of production) are played or displayed. Sometimes, there will be a service or trademark symbol at the right side of their logos, parent company byline, an animation of displaying the logo on some logos, FX/SFX which is an additional element/s that appears over the logo, and the music will play when these logos appear.\n\nOn all Disney animated movies starting with \"Finding Dory\", its logo plays at its fullest with the Disney fanfare after the credits.\n\nAfter the movie ends, it shows photos of the events during the aftermath of films like, \"Lilo & Stitch\", \"Rugrats Go Wild\", \"\", \"Up (2009 film)\", \"\", \"Rio (2011 film)\", \"The Smurfs\", \"\"The Croods\", \"Home (2015 film)\", \"\", \"Cars 3\", \"The Star (2017 film)\", \"Ferdinand (film)\".\n\n\n"}

The ethnic theme parks are advertised as a way to glimpse into different areas around the world in one easy visit.\n\nThe layout allocates a separate “village” to each ethnic group, allowing tourists and other visitors to absorb the individuality they portray. Heritage and history are simulated through elaborate costumes and roles. Visitors also have an opportunity to participate in some of the cultural practices of various ethnic groups and to engage in a question and answer based discussion.\nThe precise infrastructure of each park is different, but each aims to provide a display case for as many cultural identities as possible. At \"Windows Around the World\", for example, national heritage is classified into three categories: primitive song and dance, professional modifications, and further creative modifications.\n\nA debate over authenticity has been sparked in light of the fact that several employees represent nationalities separate from their own individual heritages.

The story describes Dalia's love for a Christian soldier Michael, kept secret from her Muslim father due to conflict in religion. Her father eventually finds out and stabs Dalia to death in a so-called honor killing. A year after publication, it was discovered that Khouri had fabricated the tale and that the story was fictional.\n\nThe novel centers on the life of Dalia, a young Muslim woman living in Amman, Jordan. When she falls in love with Michael, a young Catholic major in the British Army, she is forced to keep the relationship a secret and rely on her friend Norma to act as an intermediary. Although the lovers are only able to be alone together on a handful of occasions and Dalia's virginity remains intact, her father is so enraged when he hears of the affair from her older brother that he kills her two months after her twenty-sixth birthday. Khouri claimed that as a result, she had been forced to seek asylum in Queensland, Australia.\n\nQuestions about Khouri's story surfaced almost immediately , as several readers wrote on message boards that much of the book didn't ring true, and located 73 factual errors (some of them basic), anachronisms, and exaggerations (e.g. claiming that Jordan borders Kuwait, \"fanciful\" depictions of Amman, incorrect statements about Jordanian law, and banknotes that were not printed at the time the book supposedly took place). \n\nKhouri also aroused suspicions because she spoke perfect American English despite claiming to have never lived in the United States. \n\nFurther, Khouri had promised to donate most of the proceeds to the Jordanian National Association for Women, but had only sent $100, while the group was suspicious of her claims from the start, contending that it would have known about such a crime given Jordan's size. \n\nAfter conducting an investigation, it wrote to Random House Australia in September 2003, but Random House stood by Khouri.\n\nIn July 2004 — a year after the book's release — \"Sydney Morning Herald\" literary editor Malcolm Knox wrote a series of articles which exposed Khouri as a complete fraud: based on an 18-month investigation, he concluded Khouri had fabricated the story and sold it untruthfully as a memoir. \n\nKhouri had not lived in Jordan since 1973, but had lived in Chicago for most of her life, and was married with two children. Her family had not heard from her since 2000, when she abruptly left Chicago to write the book. \n\nKhouri continued to insist she'd told the truth, even when confronted with public records which proved beyond all doubt she had spent most of her life in the United States. Knox also unearthed evidence that suggested Khouri had left Chicago when legal problems arose with several real-estate transactions.\n\nAs a result, Random House pulled the book from the shelves in Australia and the UK indefinitely. Knox and fellow Australian journalist Caroline Overington won the 2004 Walkley Award for investigative journalism for the exposé.\n\nIn September 2007, a documentary entitled \"Forbidden Lie$\" was released. Director Anna Broinowski tells the story of how Khouri's book became a best-seller, and then follows Khouri to Jordan. Since Khouri still insists that the story is true, Broinowski gives her the opportunity to prove that it is fully or at least partly truthful; however, the evidence Broinowski uncovers indicates not only that Khouri's book is fiction (in spite of her father's claim that it was true) but that Khouri had committed a number of scams even before the book.\n\nRelated articles:\n"}

Formed in 1973 as a more camp-oriented response to San Francisco's Imperial Court System by H.L. Perry, who reigned as the Court's Grand Duchess I, the Grand Ducal Council raises money for a wide array of charity organizations through large annual costume balls and various other, smaller fund raisers throughout the year. Both the Imperial Court System and the Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco are built using roughly the same power structure. \"Monarchs\" are elected and the nonprofit, 501(c)(3) portion is run by a Board of Directors or Trustees.\n\nThe Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco, in turn, inspired similar such organizations to be founded around the country. In 1998, the Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco was joined by a sister Court located in Alameda County, on the opposite side of the San Francisco Bay. A third such sovereign Ducal Court exists in London, Ontario, Canada.\n\nCalled \"one of the city's unsung gay heroes,\" in 2006 HL Perry, her work establishing the San Francisco Ducal Council and more were commemorated with a month-long exhibit at the San Francisco Public Library.\n\nEach individual court chapter (or \"realm\") is a separate, legally incorporated charitable non-profit organization that raises funds and awareness for various charities and people in need within its realm. Each chapter has its own board of directors and is financially responsible for its own management. In addition to local non-profit status, many courts in the United States have Federal 501(c) status.\n\nEach court holds an annual \"coronation,\" which is usually the chapter's largest fundraiser and is attended by both local members and members of other Ducal chapters as well Imperial Courts from across North America. The evening culminates in the ceremony in which the new monarch or monarchs—the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess—are crowned. In San Francisco, the new monarchs are determined by popular elections held in the community.\n\nWithin a set number of weeks, the newly elected monarchs must hold an \"investiture,\" at which time they name the members of their Court. The titles given to members vary from one chapter to another and are primarily left to the discretion of the reigning monarchs.\n\nEach Court consists of a Royal Crown Prince and Royal Crown Princess, Prince/Princess Royale, Baron/Baroness, etc. Additionally, each year the Court holds fund raising competitions to crown such titles as Royal Baby Girl & Baby Boy, King & Queen of Hearts, Mr. & Miss Royal Bunny, Royal Daddy & Royal Daddy's Boy and White Knight and Debutante. In 2009, the Court added an annual fund raising pageant to crown Miss San Francisco Gold Rush.\n\nEach court conducts numerous fundraisers throughout the year. Drag shows, ranging in size from performances at local bars to events in hotel ballrooms and other large venues, are the main way in which revenue is raised for charity. Especially in recent years, court chapters have diversified their fundraising strategies so as to include yard sales, gift raffles, etc. Court members also solicit donations at LGBT events, gay pride parades and other public events at which they appear.\n\nThe Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco donates the funds raised to a variety of causes including those related to AIDS, breast cancer, domestic abuse, and homelessness.\n\nWhile composed primarily of gay and transgender as well as lesbian, bisexual and transwomen, each court is open to all. Gay, bisexual, transgender and straight people have all served as monarchs and court members in the system's history. Drag queens collectively comprise about half of the membership.\n\n"}

The damage to Japan's infrastructure prompted delays in software and hardware releases, and also caused outright cancellations when the subject matter of the software was considered too similar to real-life events. At the same time, the Japanese gaming industry took on relief efforts to assist those most directly affected by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.\n\nMembers of the gaming industry contributed donations to support foundations including several large donations from video game-oriented companies such as Nintendo, Sony Computer Entertainment, Namco Bandai, Sega Sammy, Capcom, and Tecmo Koei, and have also encouraged donations from individuals. Several online games helped donate money to the relief effort, including \"EVE Online\" and Zynga's Facebook games. Thirty-six hours after the initial tremor, Zynga has gathered donations adding up to $1.35 million.\n\nA 9.0-magnitude megathrust earthquake occurred off the coast of Japan on 11 March 2011. The epicenter was off the east coast of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku near Sendai, with the hypocenter at a depth of . The earthquake triggered extremely destructive tsunami waves of up to that struck Japan minutes after the quake, in some cases traveling up to inland, with smaller waves reaching many other countries after several hours. Tsunami warnings were issued and evacuations ordered along Japan's Pacific coast and at least 20 other countries, including the entire Pacific coast of North America and South America.\n\nThe Japanese National Police Agency officially confirmed a large number of casualties across seventeen prefectures. The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive and severe damage in Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse. Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without water. Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least three nuclear reactors suffered explosions due to hydrogen buildup within their outer containment buildings.\n\nEstimates of the Tōhoku earthquake's magnitude make it the most powerful known earthquake to hit Japan, and one of the five most powerful earthquakes in the world overall since modern record-keeping began in 1900. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said that the crisis was the country's \"toughest and most difficult\" since World War II. The earthquake moved Honshu east and shifted the Earth on its axis by almost . Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. The Bank of Japan offered ¥15 trillion (US$183 billion) to the banking system on 14 March 2011 in an effort to normalize market conditions.\n\nThe disaster resulted in a drop in stocks at the Tokyo Stock Exchange for many video game companies at the Monday close following. Eurogamer's Gamesindustry.biz website reported that Sega Sammy's dropped 13.5 percent, ending up at ¥1530; Tecmo Koei's fell 10.7 percent to ¥626; Konami's fell 9.9 percent to ¥1610; Sony's fell 9.1 percent to ¥2550; Nintendo's fell 7.6 percent to ¥21,280; Namco Bandai's fell 6.4 percent to ¥905; and Square Enix's fell 6.2 percent to ¥1370. \"Edge\" also reported drops, but lower amounts for Sega Sammy, Nintendo, and Square Enix: 1.3 percent, 1.1 percent, and 4.5 percent, respectively. Capcom's shares fell 14.4 percent, and the company announced closures of ten amusement arcades in the Tōhoku and Kantō regions due to damage. The top 20 titles sold around 568,000 units between 6 and 12 March. In the same time period, the top 10 video game systems sold close to 195,000 units. Anoop Gantayat writing for IGN, however, speculated that most video game sales in Japan stopped when the earthquake occurred. Gamasutra's Tom Cutris noted that most titles on Japan's charts dropped in sales the following week; the top 20 titles sold approximately 275,000 units. He further noted that the top seller, \"Dynasty Warriors 7\", sold 75 percent fewer copies compared to the previous week, when it debuted at number one.\n\nNo employees of Japan's gaming community have been reported as casualties of the quake or the subsequent tsunami. IGN writers noted that most video game companies are a \"significant distance\" from the earthquake's epicenter. Soon after the disaster struck, rumors began circulating that \"Pokémon\" series creator Satoshi Tajiri, among other Japanese celebrities, had died in the tsunami; however, this turned out to be false when he tweeted that he was, in fact, alive. Several artists and designers used their online presences on social networking sites to provide information not only on their own situations, but to inform others of the disaster's impact. Hideo Kojima, Masahiro Sakurai, Goichi Suda and Fumito Ueda used their Twitter accounts to pass on information, with Suda encouraging his colleagues to seek shelter. Kojima announced that he would be leaving his offices for power saving reasons. \"Ace Attorney\" series art director Tatsuro Iwamoto illustrated an image of characters from the series saying \"Let's work hard and not be defeated by the earthquake!!\". Nintendo's American subsidiary in Redmond, Washington provided updates on the status of the company headquarters and its employees.\n\nWhen asked if the Nintendo 3DS' launch in Europe and North America would be affected by the situation, Nintendo gave indication that the former will be unaffected. It elaborated that business operations and future product shipments would be unaffected. Video games analyst Michael Pachter commented that it was difficult to assess how much impact the disaster will have, commenting that a company like Nintendo will not suffer as many set backs in the release of software as other companies have, such as Sony. He noted that if the threat of a nuclear plant meltdown grows stronger, the industry could be placed in much more dire straits. Pachter also noted that while Japanese software delays would not impact the United States market, hardware shortages could. Related hardware manufacturing industries have also indirectly affected video gaming. For example, Japan's manufacturers make up 70% of world's supply of anisotropic conductive films for LCD production, and can, among other devices, affect Nintendo DS panel production. The iPad, which companies began developing games for soon after its release, was expected to be available in short supply due to components that are manufactured in Japan. Apple indefinitely delayed the Japanese release of the iPad 2. Due to production disruptions, Sony announced that it may decide to limit the initial release of PlayStation Vita to one region by the end of 2011. Investment research company Zachs described the situation as uncertain, adding that if there is a radiation leak at Fukushima's nuclear plants, it could shut down operations all over Japan.\n\nThe disaster's effects on Japan has affected a number of planned releases. Jesse Divnich, an analyst for EEDAR, expected video game delays to be the biggest impact of the disaster on the video game industry, asserting this as being due to the inflexibility of development schedules. Kevin Gifford of 1UP.com noted that the country's \"strained\" distribution networks and the number of consumers focused on the events of the disaster would result in losses should a video game be released. Some games, due to their subject matter being perceived as too similar to the real-life events, have had their releases delayed indefinitely, including Sony Computer Entertainment's \"\". While it has entered distribution channels in the United Kingdom, Sony announced that they will cease any further shipments and remove marketing material for it. Sega similarly delayed their video game, \"\", indefinitely. Early in \"Ryū ga Gotoku Of the End\"s unveiling, it was mistakenly thought to depict an \"earthquake or other natural disaster.\" Irem's upcoming release of \"\" and \"Poncotsu Roman Daikatsugeki Bumpy Trot 2\" has been cancelled altogether (with the former being re-announced in 2015 with a different title, developer and platform), with the publisher issuing an apology; the game would have been the fourth in a series of survival action games where players would need to escape a city after the onset of a major disaster, specifically a large earthquake in \"Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4\". Pre-release orders reportedly rose after the disaster.\n\nThere have been delays of video games that are not related to earthquakes or disasters; Nintendo delayed the release of their Nintendo 3DS video game \"Steel Diver\" in Japan from its original release date of 17 March, \"Major League Baseball 2K11\" and \"Top Spin 4\" were both delayed from their intended release date of April, and \"Toaru Kagaku no Railgun\" for the PlayStation Portable. The delay of \"Steel Diver\" is in spite of a statement by Nintendo that it would not postpone the release of any games. Konami delayed their Nintendo DS video game \"Powerful Golf\", Microsoft delayed the release of \"\" due to \"distribution disruption\", Capcom delayed the first download content pack for \"\" in Japan and Ubisoft similarly delayed download content for \"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\" in Japan.\n\nSome companies took steps to conserve energy by shutting down servers used for Internet gaming. Square Enix shut down its servers for \"Final Fantasy XI\" and \"Final Fantasy XIV\", while Konami suspended the servers for \"Metal Gear Online\" indefinitely. The two \"Final Fantasy\" games along with the PlayOnline service accounted for 11 percent of Square Enix's energy consumption the previous month. After implementing other energy consumption efforts to reduce energy usage by over 10 percent, including lighting reduction and ceasing office climate control, the company planned to restart the services on 25 March. Nintendo shut down service for Pokémon Global Link, a feature that was part of the newest additions to the franchise. Due to this shutdown, the release date of the feature for other countries has been delayed. Hitachi, one of Nintendo's suppliers for the manufacture of its Nintendo DS handheld system, has indicated that deliveries of its materials may be delayed, depending on whether its factories are shut down for a period of time. Sony announced that while PlayStation Network services for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable would not be interrupted, users may experience connection problems, and some content updates will be delayed. Sony later urged PSN users to back up their data. Microsoft delayed the launch of some of their Xbox 360's Xbox Live features that they had planned to release in the week following the disaster. In Japan, Sony temporarily closed their call centers, while it and Microsoft both closed their repair centers.\n\nA number of gaming-related events were canceled in the wake of the disaster. These include a number of demos for video games such as \"\", \"Dragon Ball Zenkai Battle Royal\", and others. An event planned to be held for the release of \"Ryū ga Gotoku Of the End\" to allow fans to have their copies signed in Hiroshima and Osaka was also canceled. A \"Monster Hunter\" themed event called \"\"Monster Hunter\" Festa\" was also cancelled. Microsoft delayed a tour to advertise its Kinect controller. The video game tournament Evolution vs Godsgarden was canceled over logistic concerns related to the disaster's impact.\n\nSeveral Japanese video game publishers donated relief to Japan; this includes Nintendo, which donated 300 million yen; Sony, which donated 300 million yen and 30,000 radios; Sega Sammy, which donated 200 million yen, and Namco Bandai, Capcom, and Tecmo Koei, which donated 100 million each. CyberConnect2 opened its offices and offered aid to 30 people from the general public. Sega promised to donate all proceeds earned from \"Football Manager 2011\" and its \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" titles available for iOS platforms for a week, beginning on 15 March 2011. Capcom lowered the price of the iOS version of \"Street Fighter IV\" from $4.99 to $0.99, donating the proceeds of its sales from that point on to tsunami relief. iOS developer 5pb. slashed the prices of its games from ¥2200 to ¥350 and donating all proceeds to the Red Cross until 31 March. Arc System Works employee Toshimichi Mori commented that he was in talks with his company on making download content to donate some of the proceeds. Nippon Ichi announced that the earnings from the download content release of a character in \"Disgaea 4\" for ¥100 under the name \"Fans of \"Disgaea 4\"\". Square Enix pledged to donate ¥100 million, as well as giving gamers with Square Enix accounts to use points called \"Square Enix Crysta\" to donate. They also set up a \"worldwide employee charity fund\". Level-5 donated 10 million yen, as well as pledging to release charity items through its video game \"Inazuma Eleven Mobile\".\n\nOnline gaming publications have launched relief drives of their own. IGN started up a fundraiser, wherein its staff plays 24 Japanese-made games in 24 hours in an attempt to garner donations of $24,000, while Brian Crecente of Kotaku will host the Japan Earthquake Relief Fundraiser on 24 March 2011 in Denver, Colorado, in which proceeds will go to the Japanese Red Cross Society. \"Game Informer\"s Meagan Marie put up for auction her \"Mario\"-themed Nintendo DS autographed by several people with links to Nintendo, including Shigeru Miyamoto, Koji Kondo, Eiji Aonuma, Charles Martinet, and Martin Leung, with the proceeds to go to Japanese relief. Siliconera put up for auction an action figure of the fictional character Cecil from \"\", signed by \"Final Fantasy IV\" designer Takashi Tokita. The industry's online auction efforts organized into Play For Japan, which acts as an online hub for auctions of collectible video game paraphernalia.\n\nNon-Japanese video game companies also provided assistance. Mastiff, in addition to a sum of money already donated, pledged to donate $100 for every 100 Facebook likes their page receives, up to $25,000 worth. Shawnimals discounted two video games, \"Wee Ninja\" and \"Wee Devil\", to $10, pledging to donate all profits made to the relief fund. \"EVE Online\" players are able to donate the game's in-game currency, which will be converted into real-world money and given to the Red Cross, and players of select Facebook games by Zynga, such as \"FarmVille\" and \"CityVille\", can purchase special in-game items, whose profits would go to helping support the Japanese relief effort. 36 hours in, Zynga has collected approximately $1.35 million. ScrewAttack announced that all profits made from their game, \"Texting of the Bread\", would go to the American Red Cross. NEXON Corporation announced that all profits made from specific in-game items for sale in their games, such as \"MapleStory\", will go to the relief effort. American developer and publisher PopCap Games, in partnership with the Red Cross, discounted its entire line of iOS games and pledged to donate all proceeds to relief efforts. Valve Software announced that they will be donating all proceeds from the purchase of certain items purchased in their game \"Team Fortress 2\". Publisher Aksys Games initiated a charity sales drive where all gross proceeds from sales from their website would be donated to Red Cross, raising $34,162.33. NCsoft pledged to donate ¥500 million (approx €4.5 million/£3.9 million/$6.3 million), which they describe as \"one month's earnings\". They also pledged to provide \"payment support\" to quake victims who cannot log in for \"extended periods\". Riot Games created charity skins for their League of Legends games that people could purchase, with all proceeds being donated to the Red Cross for Earthquake relief.\n\n"}
{"id": "32580430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32580430", "title": "International Colonial and Export Exhibition", "text": "International Colonial and Export Exhibition\n\nThe International Colonial and Export Exhibition (Dutch: \"Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling\"; French: \"Exposition Universelle Coloniale et d'Exportation Générale\") was a colonial exhibition (a type of World's Fair) that was held in Amsterdam from May 1 to October 1, 1883. The event drew at least a million visitors and was the first international colonial exhibition, with 28 different nations presenting their colonial trade and wealth. \n\nThe event was the brainchild of Edouard Agostini, a French entrepreneur. Agostini, who had previously been involved in organizing the 1878 Exposition Universelle in Paris, presented his plans to the city of Amsterdam and King William III of the Netherlands in 1880. The Dutch government was initially hesitant, but Agostini managed to secure funding from Belgian and French investors.\n\nThe location chosen for the exhibition was an unused area of land behind the Rijksmuseum, which at that time was still under construction. This area is now Museumplein square. The main building was designed by the French architect Paul Fouquiau in \"Moorish\" style. It was constructed of wood covered with plaster and painted cloth, in order to give the impression of marble. Between the building's two large towers, a large cloth in \"Indian\" style was hung, with plaster heads of elephants and other animals. The building contained pavilions representing 28 different nations, including France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Japan, the United States, China, Canada, the Ottoman Empire, Siam (Thailand), Transvaal, and the host country, the Netherlands. \n\nItems on show in the main building included a telephone, wood- and metalworking machines, and a safe large enough to fit eight people. The building's colonial section presented products such as tobacco and rubber, as well as a reconstructed Javanese-style settlement (\"kampung\") with \"natives\". At that time, it was not considered degrading or racist to put humans on display; in fact, it became a regularly featured spectacle at such exhibitions (see further: Human zoo).\n\nOther structures included a music pavilion; the pavilion of the city of Amsterdam; the Dutch colonial pavilion; a Japanese bazar; various shops; and Dutch, English and German restaurants. In front of the Dutch colonial pavilion was a statue of Jan Pieterszoon Coen who, as governor-general of the Dutch East Indies, played a large part in the Dutch conquest of the Indonesian archipelago. A canal with a bamboo bridge and a Chinese junk intersected the exhibition grounds.\n\nThe exhibition, bringing more than a million visitors from around the world to Amsterdam, provided the city with a huge economic boost. A number of hotels were expanded or newly built in order to profit from the large number of visitors, including the Hotel Americain, the , and Hotel Krasnapolsky. The expansion of the Krasnapolsky included the glass-roofed \"Wintertuin\" lounge, with electric lighting, which at that time was considered a real novelty.\n\nIn Amsterdam, modern-day remains of the exhibition are the front gate of the Vondelpark and a collection of items in the Tropenmuseum which were on show in the Dutch colonial pavilion. Some items from the Dutch colonial pavilion were also donated to the ethnological museum of Artis zoo and, after this museum was closed, ended up in the Tropenmuseum as well. However, the lion's share of the thousands of items from this pavilion was donated to the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. Some parts of the German restaurant are now in the Veenkoloniaal Museum in Veendam.\n\nHeineken still uses the label \"Diplôme d'Honneur\" on its beer bottles, an honour that was bestowed on the brewer at the 1883 colonial exhibition.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922352", "title": "Intertitle", "text": "Intertitle\n\nIn films, an intertitle (also known as a title card) is a piece of filmed, printed text edited into the midst of (i.e. \"inter-\") the photographed action at various points. Intertitles used to convey character dialogue are referred to as \"dialogue intertitles\", and those used to provide related descriptive/narrative material are referred to as \"expository intertitles\". In modern usage, the terms refer to similar text and logo material inserted at or near the start of films and television shows.\n\nIn this era intertitles were always called \"subtitles\" and often had Art Deco motifs. They were a mainstay of silent films once the films became of sufficient length and detail to necessitate dialogue and/or narration to make sense of the enacted or documented events. \"The British Film Catalogue\" credits the 1898 film \"Our New General Servant\" by Robert W. Paul as the first British film to use intertitles. Film scholar Kamilla Elliott identifies another early use of intertitles in the 1901 British film \"Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost\". The first Academy Awards presentation in 1929 included an award for \"Best Title Writing\" that went to Joseph W. Farnham for no specific film. The award was never given again, as intertitles went out of common use due to the introduction of \"talkies\".\n\nIn modern use, intertitles are used to supply an epigraph, such as a poem, or to distinguish various \"acts\" of a film or multimedia production by use as a title card. However, they are most commonly used as part of a historical drama's epilogue to explain what happened to the depicted characters and events after the conclusion of the story proper.\n\nThe development of the soundtrack slowly eliminated their utility as a narrative device (they were common for providing narration, but not dialogue, well into the 1930s), but they are occasionally still used as an artistic device. For instance, intertitles were used as a gimmick in \"Frasier\". The BBC's drama \"Threads\" uses them to give location, date and information on distant events beyond Sheffield. \"Law & Order\" and its related spinoffs used them to give not only the location, but also the date of the upcoming scene. Guy Maddin is a modern filmmaker known for recreating the style of older films, and uses intertitles appropriately. Some locally produced shows, such as quiz bowl game shows, use animated variations of intertitles to introduce the next round.\n\nIntertitles have had a long history in the area of amateur film as well. The efforts of home movie aficionados to intertitle their works post-production have led to the development of a number of innovative approaches to the challenge. Frequently lacking access to high quality film dubbing and splicing equipment, amateur film makers must plan ahead when making a film to allow space for filming an intertitle over the existing film. Intertitles may be printed neatly on a piece of paper, a card, or a piece of cardboard and filmed, or they may be formed from adhesive strips and affixed to glass. In the early 1980s, digital recording technology improved to the point where intertitles could be created in born-digital format and recorded directly onto the film. Several specialty accessories from this period such as Sony's HVT-2100 Titler and cameras such as Matsushita's Quasar VK-743 and Zenith VC-1800 could be used to generate intertitles for home movies. Early 1980s video game consoles and applications catering to the demo scene were also adapted for the generation and recording of intertitles for home films. Among these were included the ColecoVision, the Magnavox Odyssey² (using programs such as the \"Type & Talk\" cartridge and the \"Voice\" module), the Bally Astrocade (using the built-in \"Scribbling\" program or the more advanced \"Creative Crayon\" cartridge), and the intertitle-specialized Famicom Titler.\n\n"}

Jovian sometimes shared the title role with his father.\n\nJovian was born on April 10, 1994, at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina, to Nigel and Flavia, Coquerel's sifaka lemurs. \n\nWhen Martin Kratt and his younger brother Chris wanted a lemur co-host for their TV show \"Zoboomafoo\", Martin returned to the Duke Lemur Center, where he had previously volunteered while a student at Duke University. In 1997, the Kratts prepared for the show by filming Jovian and his parents jumping around an outdoor cage modelled on the stage set. Jovian appeared on the program from January 1999 to November 2001. Jovian would appear mostly in the opening segments, before transforming into a talking lemur puppet after eating his meals.\n\nZoboomafoo's voice was provided by veteran Canadian puppeteer Gord Robertson.\n\nAfter appearing on the show, Jovian was credited with attracting 15,000 visitors to the Duke Lemur Center each year. As part of the center's breeding program, Jovian mated with a lemur named Pia. One of their offspring, Charlemagne, was taken to a different habitat after Jovian rejected him from the family group. Jovian became ill in the late winter of 2013. He lost a large amount of weight in June 2014 and would only eat in his cage. Pia became pregnant shortly before his death.\n\nOn November 10, 2014, Jovian died in his home at the Duke Lemur Center at the age of 20. News of his death spread quickly worldwide, with an outpouring of grief from the public and media industry. The first relative of Jovian to be born after his death was his granddaughter Isabella, born on January 25, 2015.\n\n"}

{"id": "17216155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17216155", "title": "Love in This Club Part II", "text": "Love in This Club Part II\n\n\"Love in This Club Part II\" is a song recorded by American R&B singer Usher, and features fellow rapper Lil Wayne and singer Beyoncé. \"Love in This Club Part II\" was released by LaFace Records on April 28, 2008, as the second single from Usher's fifth studio album, \"Here I Stand\" (2008). It is a sequel to the album's lead single \"Love in This Club\" which features Young Jeezy. Originally, vocalist Mariah Carey and rapper Plies were intended to feature on the record. Usher acclaimed the additions of Beyoncé and Wayne, and called it \"a really special record\". Produced by Soundz, the track samples the 1971 song \"You Are Everything\" by The Stylistics.\n\nThe song appeared on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the Canadian Hot 100 and the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. \"Love in This Club Part II\" also reached the top ten on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and its master tone received a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nThe original song, \"Love in This Club\", was sung by Usher, with guest vocals from rapper Young Jeezy also present. It was written by Usher, Polow da Don, Lamar Taylor, Young Jeezy, Ryon Lovett, Keith Thomas and Darnell Dalton, with da Don producing the track. The remix features additional writing from Lil Wayne, with Soundz producing the track. Usher said in an interview with MTV of the song, \"I wanted it to be something that would be a surprise, be a shock. Have shock value. That's what the remix is all about.\" On working with Beyoncé, he said, \"It's a treat for me. I've been wanting for years to do a record with Beyoncé. Even though it's a remix, it's a really special record for me\". He also spoke highly of Wayne, dubbing him \"one of the illest in the game\". The song was originally intended to be sung by Usher with Mariah Carey and rapper Plies. While Plies had recorded two verses for the song, he and Carey did not appear on the final cut, with Beyoncé and Wayne featuring instead. Rumours also surfaced that R&B singer Keri Hilson would make an appearance on the tune. The song, one of the last additions to \"Here I Stand\", was recorded at Hitland Studios in Alpharetta and The Record Plant in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Love in This Club Part II\" was added for urban contemporary radio airplay in the United States on the week of April 28, 2008. A version without Wayne's verse appeared as a B-side to the CD single of \"Moving Mountains\", released on July 22, 2008.\n\nThe tempo of \"Love in This Club Part II\" is much slower than that of the original song. Idolator compared the slowing-down to the remixing of R. Kelly's \"Ignition\" (2002). Usher has said that he likes Part II more than the original. The tune samples The Stylistics' 1971 number \"You Are Everything\", written by Thom Bell and Linda Creed. The lyrics and theme of the song are similar to those of Part I, with Serena Kim of \"The Washington Post\" describing it as \"mighty pressure coming from...male voices to persuade one woman to succumb to spontaneous sex\", while Beyoncé portrays herself as a \"hesitant but willing\" voice of reason. Wayne's lyrics, modified through the use of a vocoder to make him sound intoxicated, are wily seductions to have his love interest have intercourse with him in the club's bathroom. During Wayne's verse, Usher sings breathy ad-libs. In the song, Usher refers to Beyoncé as \"Queen B\".\n\nShaheem Reid of MTV News praised Wayne's vocals as a repeat of his melodic success on \"Lollipop\". YoRapper.com also appreciated Wayne's effort, saying \"aside from sounding like he's dying, he delivers an entertaining verse.\" Stuff liked the way that his presence offered relief from the ballads on \"Here I Stand\".\nAbout.com's Mark Nero lauded the song as being \"much better than the original version\", noting Beyoncé's appearance as \"regal\", while Idolator also praised the collaboration with Beyoncé and Wayne as \"much better\" than that with Young Jeezy, who recorded on the original track. Steve Jones of \"USA Today\" picked \"Love in This Club Part II\" as a standout track of \"Here I Stand\".\n\nHowever, Josh Eells of \"Blender\" was not impressed, writing that the song \"manages to make two of the most desirable people on the planet [Usher and Beyoncé] sound chaste\", while IGN's Chad Grischow called the record \"bland\" and \"lacking at best\". Simon Vozick-Levinson from \"Entertainment Weekly\" criticized Usher's pick-up lines, describing them as more ridiculous than in the original song, as well as Wayne's reusing of lyrics from both \"Lollipop\" and his remix of \"Crying Out for Me\" (2007) by Mario. On the other hand, Vozick-Levinson commended Beyoncé's vocal performance on the track. Joey Guerra of the \"Houston Chronicle\" said that Beyoncé's vocal was the clear standout on the song. The song was listed as 36 in the \"Rolling Stone\"'s The 100 Best Song of 2008.\n\n\"Love in This Club Part II\" debuted on the United States \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number seventy-nine on the issue dated May 10, 2008, due to high radio airplay and digital sales. It climbed the chart, reaching its peak position of number eighteen three weeks later. \"Love in This Club Part II\" slipped off the chart after twenty-two weeks. On the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, the song debuted at number fourteen the same week. It peaked on the chart at number seven on June 21, 2008, gaining the 'Digital Gainer' honor the same week. It gave Usher his thirteenth top ten song on the component chart and lasted thirty-four weeks on the chart. The song was among the Pop 100, where it peaked at number thirty-five. \"Love in This Club Part II\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 8, 2008, for sales of over 500,000 master tones. As of October 3, 2010, it has sold 366,000 digital music downloads in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\nOn May 31, 2008, the song debuted and peaked on the Canadian Hot 100 at number sixty-nine, and fell off the chart four weeks later. In Australia, \"Love in This Club Part II\" debuted and peaked on the ARIA Singles Chart at number ninety-six on the chart dated June 9, 2008.\n\n\n"}

The term generally refers to board games or wargames which were packaged and sold with instructions and maps or playing surfaces printed in a booklet format, or as one large sheet folded until it became \"pocket sized\" (approximately 4×7 inches). Game pieces (also known as chits or counters) were printed on one or more sheets of thick paper which the player sometimes had to cut for themselves.

The pageant is organised by companies MISS DEAF s.r.o. and MISS – MISTER DEAF s.r.o., and their president is Josef Uhlir. The official language in the contest is International Sign Language, and the crystal crowns for all the finalists are made by Astera-glass.\n\nBy the rules of the contest, a winner is disallowed to participate in another beauty contest. In July 9, 2010 there was a MDW contest in Tbilisi, Georgia, and Miss Julie Abbou from France contested. She won three titles of the first Vicemiss Deaf World 2010, the second Vicemiss Deaf World 2010 and of the Miss Sympathy Deaf World 2010. Afterwards, Abbou contested Miss Deaf International in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 31, 2010, and was crowned as Miss Deaf International. As a result, Uhlir published an announcement at MDW website about disqualifying Abbou from the titles of 1st Vicemiss Deaf World 2010 and of Miss Sympathy Deaf World 2010, which Abbou won during the final ceremony of Miss Deaf World 2010 and Miss Deaf Europe 2010 competitions in Tbilisi. Uhlir stated that during the MDW competitions, Abbou was personally informed, as well as the other competing girls, that in the case of receiving one of the official titles of the MDW competitions, the winner was prohibited from participation in any other Miss competition. Uhlir explained the reason for keeping the high status of the both competitions, keeping the high reputation of the gained titles and preventing any hurt of Miss Deaf World and Miss Deaf Europe competitions prestige. Uhlir added that every girl could participate these competitions, even two times, if she was not awarded any of the titles during her first participation. He wrote that with validity from August 1st, 2010, the title of first Vicemiss Deaf World 2010, which was taken from Abbou, went to Zhihuang Wang from China, and her title of second Vicemiss Deaf World 2010 went to Stella Falawo Kunjan from Ghana, which took originally the fourth place. The title of Miss Sympathy Deaf World 2010, which also was taken from Abbou by Uhlir, would be won by Portia Oliver from South Africa, which took originally the second place in this category.\n\nIn 2018, Assia Uhanany from Israel won Miss Deaf World. Xu Jinghui, a contestant from China, took a photo with her, and wrote her impression of the contest. She told about the foreign environment in Prague, wishing to contact foreign Deaf friends from different countries, hopefully communicating with them. She wrote her dailiy activity: The second day was a free day, and they visited close attractions, starting to make Deaf friends by chatting each other with the international sign language. The third day to the sixth day went at class, practicing the show together, and sharing international sign language and Deaf culture among different countries. The show started on September 29, 2018, left her a little sad and discouraged, but it was a rare experience for her. She was happy to be able to go abroad and acquire a lot of foreign friends, and thanked the China Association of the Deaf for giving her such a chance to go abroad, and for teaching her international sign language as well.\n\n"}
{"id": "3859329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3859329", "title": "Music store", "text": "Music store\n\nA music store or musical instrument store is a retail business that sells musical instruments and related equipment and accessories. In United States and Canada, most music stores in the 2010s sell a range of electric instruments (e.g., electric guitars), instrument amplifiers (e.g., guitar amplifiers); electronic instruments (e.g., synthesizers); drum kits (including drums, cymbals and percussion instruments) and acoustic classical, concert band and jazz musical instruments such as saxophones, trumpets and violins. In addition, stores typically sell (and sometimes rent) the sound reinforcement system and PA system gear used in live concert performances and the sound recording equipment used to record music, such as microphones and digital recorders.\n\nIn the 2010s, music stores can be \"bricks and mortar\" stores (either individual small businesses or chain stores, which may be a regional or national chain); online musical instrument stores, which consist of a website describing the merchandise, various online payment systems, and shipping or delivery systems; or hybrid stores that have both \"bricks and mortar\" stores and an online store. Some \"bricks and mortar\" music stores also provide services for a fee, such as music lessons, musical instrument repair and guitar amplifier repair.\n\nIn the 2010s, general music stores typically carry a range of instruments used in popular music and traditional music such as the electric guitar, acoustic guitar, electric bass, guitar strings, instrument amplifiers (guitar amplifier, bass amplifier and keyboard amplifier), electronic effects (e.g., distortion pedals), electronic keyboards (including digital pianos, stage pianos, clonewheel organs and synthesizers), drum kit components, which include drums, cymbals, drum and cymbal stands and drum accessories (drum sticks, drum heads, etc.) and percussion instruments (e.g., tambourine, shakers, etc.). Some stores carry other types of stringed instruments, such as mandolins and ukuleles.\n\nGeneral music stores also typically carry sound reinforcement system gear such as microphones, small-to mid-sized mixing consoles designed for live sound, speaker enclosures, PA systems, power amplifiers and mic stands and sound recording equipment such as studio microphones, recording-oriented mixing consoles, digital recording systems, digital audio workstations and digital audio software (e.g., softsynths, virtual instruments, ProTools, etc.).\n\nGeneral music stores often carry a range of music accessories used during rehearsals and performances, such as metronomes, electronic tuners, music stands, stand lights and conducting batons.\n\nGeneral music stores may also sell brass instruments (e.g., trombone, trumpet, etc.), woodwind instruments (flute, clarinet, saxophone, etc.) and instruments from the violin family (violin, viola, cello and bass), but there is usually a smaller selection of these instruments, as compared with the guitar, bass and drum sections.\n\nSome music stores also sell sheet music, including popular music, traditional music and Broadway songs, movie soundtrack scores, classical music pieces and instrument methods and studies (\"etudes\"). In the 2010s, some stores also sell instructional music DVDs and play-along CDs, which typically contain sheet music with the written melodies, which the performer can play or sing while a recording of each song or piece's accompaniment plays on a CD player.\n\nSome music stores also provide services to customers for a fee, such as instrument maintenance and repair, amplifier and sound gear repairs, and/or music lessons. Some music stores rent guitars, basses, amplifiers, stage pianos and PA system equipment.\n\nLarger cities may have a large enough population to support both general music stores and specialized music stores. Music stores in smaller towns tend to be general music stores, because there is not enough of a customer base to support specialized music stores. In the 2010s, general music stores have had to face competition from online music stores, which offer a huge selection of instruments and equipment.\n\nElectric guitars started appearing in the 1930s and are one of the most popular musical instruments to buy from a music store. Electric guitars can be heard in all types of music from pop, rock, blues, jazz, heavy metal, funk, hip hop. Mainstream electric guitars stores sell well-known brands like Gibson, Fender and Ibanez. Most guitar stores sell six-string models, bass guitars, left handed guitars and electric guitar packages for beginners, which typically include a budget-priced electric guitar, a small practice amplifier, a strap and picks.\n\n\"Guitar World\" magazine states that since guitar stores require patrons to try out guitars and amplifiers in the premises, some guitar players are nervous about playing in front of the store staff and other patrons. The columnist, Tyler Larson, states that apart from playing too loud, which is avoided, patrons should feel confident to test out the guitars and amplifiers in the guitar stores, because \"...real musicians never look down on anybody for being at a different skill level\". A University Press of Kentucky book on women in music states that customers did not treat a woman who worked at a guitar store like she knew anything about guitars until she would use special guitar terms. Indie folk singer-songwriter/guitarist Ani di Franco states that for women, in the past, even entering a guitar store was an \"act of courage\" because it felt like a \"boys' club\".\n\nOne common specialty store is the piano store, which typically sells a range of upright pianos and grand pianos. In the 2010s, some piano shops also sell grand pianos equipped with a digital player piano mechanism that can play back a recorded performance by activating the hammers. In the 2010s, some piano stores sell high-end digital pianos.\n\nIn 2015, \"The Guardian\" reported that in the US, piano stores have been closing, \"...as kids snub lessons for other activities\" such as amateur sports, as people taking piano lessons opt for much less costly \"electronic keyboards or used pianos\" and as children in the 2010s shift their interests away from traditional activities like piano lessons and towards newer computer-oriented activities.\n\nAnother challenge for piano stores selling new instruments is that there are piano technicians who repair good-quality used pianos and sell them at much less than the cost of a new instrument. Some piano stores offer rental of new pianos; as well, some piano stores sell used pianos. In 2015, it was reported that historic Detroit piano stores were closing. As well, in 2015, it was reported that \"...US piano stores [are being] forced to close as recession, new technology [such as electronic keyboards] and cultural change take their toll.\" Another factor in the declining sales of pianos in the US is that pianos last a long time; high-quality, properly-maintained pianos can remain playable for 60 to 80 years after their original purchase. The high price of pianos is one factor that is causing the closing of piano stores: \"A good grand piano from a respected name costs about as much as a luxury automobile\", and as such, children (and their parents) are choosing less expensive instruments, such as electronic keyboards or stringed instruments.\n\nHowever, in China, \"piano sales are booming\", with most of these piano sales being intended for home use; this rise in sales is in part because the costly instruments are viewed as a status symbol in China.\n\nIn the basement below the Steinway piano showroom in New York City, a selection of professional grand pianos are available, so that visiting piano performers playing a recital or doing a sound recording can select the instrument with their preferred sound.\n\nAnother specialty shop is the \"violin shop\", which, despite its name, often sells various violin family instruments (violin, viola, cello and often double bass, and the bows, strings, rosin, chinrests, and other accessories used with these instruments). Violin shops are often operated by luthiers (violinmakers) who make violin family instruments and bows for sale. Luthiers also do maintenance and repairs on violin family instruments and bows.\n\nAccording to \"PBS Newshour\", one US violinmaker who sells his instruments is combining his extensive knowledge of centuries-old violin-building techniques with 2010s-era technology such as \"CT scans\" and \"3D lasers\", which are giving him new insights into his violin design and construction approaches.\n\nSheet music stores sell printed classical music for songs, instrumental solo pieces, chamber music, and scores for major symphonies and choral works, along with instrumental method books, \"etudes\" (studies) and graded musical exercises. Many sheet music stores also carry printed music songs for popular music genres such as rock, pop and musical theatre including individual songs and collections of songs grouped by artist, musical, or genre. Music for guitarists or electric bass players may be in tabulature notation, which depicts where on the instrument the performer should play a line. In the 2010s, sheet music stores often sell legal, copyright-compliant jazz fake books. Sheet music stores often carry some practice accessories, such as metronomes, music stands and tuning forks.\n\nSpecialized music stores that sell only guitars, only basses or only drums are more likely to be found in major cities. Guitar and bass-focused stores typically sell instruments and the amplifiers and effects pedals used with these instruments.\n\nPro audio stores sell and in many cases, rent sound reinforcement system components, PA systems, microphones and other audio gear. Some stores also rent \"backline\" musical gear, such as stage pianos and bass amps.\n\nPrior to the widespread availability of lightweight electronic clonewheel organs in the 1980s and 1990s that emulate the sound of a heavy, electromechanical Hammond organ, many cities had organ stores which sold large electric and electronic theatre organs and spinet organs made by Hammond, Lowrey and other manufacturers. These organs were sold for use in private homes and in churches; electric and electronic organs were popular for churches, because they cost significantly less than a pipe organ.\n\nSome music stores sell used, vintage or collectible instruments and sound gear, often using a consignment model, in which the store only pays the seller for her instrument when it is sold. Even though there has been a major shift towards the use of electronic and digital instruments and sound gear in the 2000s, there is still a strong interest in vintage instruments amongst musicians who play blues, roots rock, Americana and indie rock. Vintage instruments that are sought out include 1950s and 1960s Hammond organs, Fender Bassman amps and electric guitars, 1970s Fender Rhodes electric pianos and old analog effects, such as 1970s and 1980s stompbox pedals. Stores that mostly sell used equipment may also sell some new merchandise, such as new guitar strings, patch cords and mic cables. Conversely, some stores that mostly sell new equipment may also sell some vintage, used equipment (typically a small number of high-priced collectible instruments).\n\nIn the 2000s, some music stores sell their instruments and sound gear through a website that contains digital photos of the equipment, which are grouped into categories (e.g., electric guitars, amplifiers, PA gear). Each photo of a product is accompanied by the name and model number of each item, a description of each product's features and the price. The sophistication of online music stores varies. Some online music stores have a single photo of the item, the product name and price, and a few bullets about the features. On the other hand, some online music stores have interactive Web 2.0 features, such as 360-degree virtual reality-style images of the products, in which the viewer can \"turn\" the product around to see the back and sides, online comments sections where customers can review their purchases and additional music-related content, such as articles on musical instruments or sound gear written by store staff. Patrons pay electronically at online music stores using a credit card, PayPal or other electronic payment systems. The goods are shipped through the mail or by express delivery companies such as FedEx. Some music stores sell their products solely online. In other cases, some stores operate both a \"bricks and mortar\" store (or chain) and an online store.\n\n"}

{"id": "310022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=310022", "title": "Phil Silvers", "text": "Phil Silvers\n\nPhil Silvers (May 11, 1911 – November 1, 1985) was an American entertainer and comedic actor, known as \"The King of Chutzpah\". He starred in \"The Phil Silvers Show\", a 1950s sitcom set on a U.S. Army post in which he played Master Sergeant Ernest (Ernie) Bilko.\n\nBorn Philip Silver or Philip Silversmith on May 11, 1911, in Brooklyn, New York, in the working-class Brownsville section, he was the eighth and youngest child of Russian Jewish immigrants, Saul and Sarah (née Handler) Silver. His siblings were Lillian, Harry, Jack, Saul, Pearl, Michael, and Reuben Silver. His father, a sheet metal worker, helped build the early New York skyscrapers.\n\nSilvers began entertaining aged 11, when he would sing in theaters when the film projector broke down (a common occurrence in those days), to the point where he was allowed to keep attending the same movie theater free of charge, to sing through any future breakdowns. By age 13, he was working as a singer in the Gus Edwards Revue, and then worked in vaudeville and as a burlesque comic.\n\nSilvers next worked in short films for the Vitaphone studio, such as \"Ups and Downs\" (1937), and on Broadway, where he made his début in the short-lived show \"Yokel Boy\" in 1939. Critics raved about Silvers, who was hailed as the bright spot in the mediocre play. The Broadway revue \"High Kickers\" (1941) was based on his concept.\n\nHe made his feature film début in \"Hit Parade of 1941\" in 1940 (his previous appearance as a 'pitch man' in \"Strike Up the Band\" was cut). Over the next two decades, he worked as a character actor for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Columbia, and 20th Century Fox, in such films as \"All Through the Night\" (1942) with Humphrey Bogart. Around the same time, he played a scene with W. C. Fields in \"Tales of Manhattan\" (also 1942) which was cut from the original release, but restored decades later in home video issues. Silvers also appeared in \"Lady Be Good\" (1941), \"Coney Island\" (1943), \"Cover Girl\" (1944), with Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth, and \"Summer Stock\" (1950). When the studio system began to decline, he returned to the stage.\n\nSilvers wrote the lyrics for Frank Sinatra's \"Nancy (With the Laughing Face)\". Although he was not a songwriter, he wrote the lyrics while visiting composer Jimmy Van Heusen. The two composed the song for Van Heusen's writing partner Johnny Burke, for his wife Bessie's birthday. Substituting Sinatra's little daughter's name Nancy at her birthday party, the trio pressed the singer to record it himself. The song became a popular hit in 1945 and was a staple in Sinatra's live performances. Towards the end of the Second World War, Silvers entertained the troops during several successful overseas USO tours with Sinatra.\n\nSilvers scored a major triumph in \"Top Banana\", a Broadway show of 1952. Silvers played Jerry Biffle, the egocentric, always-busy star of a major television show. (The character is said to have been based on Milton Berle.) Silvers dominated the show and won a Tony Award for his performance. He repeated the role in the 1954 film version which was initially released in 3-D.\n\nAccording to the documentary on the DVD of \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\", Silvers was not a traditional comedian: he was a comic actor. Silvers never did stand-up, and, out of character, he was not known for cracking jokes.\n\nSilvers became a household name in 1955 when he starred as Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko in \"You'll Never Get Rich\", later retitled \"The Phil Silvers Show\". The military comedy became a television hit, with the opportunistic Bilko fast-talking his way through one obstacle after another. In 1958, CBS switched the show to be telecast on Friday nights and moved the setting to Camp Fremont in California. A year later, the show was off the schedule.\n\nSilvers returned to Broadway in the musical \"Do Re Mi\" in December 1960, receiving a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. Stanley Green wrote, \"It was particularly blessed by offering two outstanding clowns in Phil Silvers as the pushiest of patsies and Nancy Walker.\" Throughout the 1960s, he appeared in films such as \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963) and \"40 Pounds of Trouble\" (1963). He was featured in Marilyn Monroe's last film, the unfinished \"Something's Got to Give\" (1962). In the 1963–1964 television season, he appeared as Harry Grafton, a factory foreman interested in get-rich-quick schemes, much like the previous Bilko character, in CBS's 30-episode \"The New Phil Silvers Show\", with co-stars Stafford Repp, Herbie Faye, Buddy Lester, Elena Verdugo as his sister, Audrey, and her children, played by Ronnie Dapo and Sandy Descher. In 1967, he starred as a guest in one of the British Carry On films, \"Follow That Camel\", a Foreign Legion parody in which he played a variation of the Sergeant Bilko character, Sergeant Nocker.\nProducer Peter Rogers employed him to ensure the Carry On films' success in America, though Silvers' presence did not ensure the film's success on either side of the Atlantic. His salary was £30,000, the largest Carry On salary ever, only later met by the appearance of Elke Sommer in \"Carry On Behind\".\nSilvers was offered the leading role of conniving Roman slave Pseudolus in the Broadway musical comedy \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\". Silvers declined, and the role went instead to Zero Mostel, who was so successful in the role that he repeated the role in the 1966 film version. By this time, Silvers realized his error, and agreed to appear in the film as a secondary character, flesh merchant Marcus Lycus. When actor-producer Larry Blyden mounted a Broadway revival of \"Forum\" in 1972, he wanted Phil Silvers to play the lead, and this time Silvers agreed. The revival was a hit and Silvers became the first leading actor ever to win a Tony Award in a revival of a musical.\n\nSilvers also guested on \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", and various TV variety shows such as \"The Carol Burnett Show\", \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\" and \"The Dean Martin Show\". He appeared as curmudgeonly Hollywood producer Harold Hecuba in the classic 1966 episode \"The Producer\" on \"Gilligan's Island\", where he and the castaways performed a musical version of \"Hamlet\". (Silvers' production company Gladasya – named after his catchphrase \"Gladdaseeya!\" – financed the show.)\nPhil Silvers was married twice, to Jo-Carroll Dennison, and to Evelyn Patrick. Both of his marriages ended in divorce. He had five daughters — Candace, Cathy, Laurie, Nancey, and Tracey Edythe — all by his second wife, Evelyn Patrick.\n\nLike his alter-ego Ernie Bilko, Silvers was a compulsive gambler, and also suffered from chronic depression. He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1962 while performing in Spain. While staying in Reno, Nevada, in the 1950s, he would often gamble all night. On one occasion, at the tiny Cal-Neva Lodge in nearby Lake Tahoe, Nevada, Silvers spent an entire night playing craps until he lost all his money and then went through $1,000 in credit. A taxi was called to return him to Reno. It was \"[o]ne of the worst nights of my life', Silvers told the driver, adding, \"Don't wait for any lights and don't wait for any tip . . . I left it at the Cal-Neva!\"\n\nHis memoir is titled \"This Laugh Is On Me\".\n\nSilvers suffered a stroke during the run of \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" in August 1972. He was left with slurred speech. Despite his poor health, he continued working, playing Harry Starman in the 1974 \"Horror in the Heights\" episode of \"\" starring Darren McGavin. His guest appearances continued into the early 1980s, including co-starring in \"The Chicken Chronicles\" (1977), an appearance on \"Fantasy Island\" as an old comic trying to reunite with his old partner, and on \"Happy Days\" as the father of Jenny Piccolo (played by his real daughter Cathy). Silvers played the cab driver Hoppy in Neil Simon's send-up of hard-boiled detective films, \"The Cheap Detective\" (1978), which starred Peter Falk. In his cab, Silvers can be heard (three words) and seen turning his head towards the camera and breaking into a smile (1/4 fps) at the movie's ending immediately prior to Falk entering \"Hoppy's\" cab. His final appearance was in an episode of \"CHiPs\" (entitled \"Hot Date\") in 1983.\n\nOn November 1, 1985, Silvers died in his sleep in Century City, California. According to his family, Silvers died of natural causes. He was interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1996, TV Guide ranked him number 31 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.\n\nIn 2003, \"The Phil Silvers Show\" was voted Best Sitcom in the \"Radio Times\" Guide to TV Comedy. In a 2005 poll to find \"The Comedian's Comedian\", Silvers was voted #42 on the list of the top 50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. Dick Van Dyke, who made his TV debut on \"Bilko\", says he \"was always fascinated with Phil's sense of timing. Incredible.\"\n\nVoice actor Daws Butler employed an impression of Silvers as the voice of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Hokey Wolf and also used the same voice in numerous cartoons for Jay Ward. The premise of \"The Phil Silvers Show\" was the basis for the Hanna-Barbera cartoon \"Top Cat\", for which Arnold Stang moderately imitated Silvers' voice for the title character. The 1993 cartoon series \"The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog\" featured a character called Wes Weasley, who had a very similar appearance and voice to Silvers.\n\n\"Sgt Bilko's Vintage Emporium and The Phil Silvers Archival Museum\" houses personal and commercial memorabilia collected by Silvers' correspondent Steve Everitt is located in Fargo Village, Coventry, United Kingdom.\n\nSource: Internet Broadway Database\n\n\nSource: Turner Classic Movies\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30854972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30854972", "title": "Red Sonja (film)", "text": "Red Sonja (film)\n\nRed Sonja is a 1985 Dutch-American sword and sorcery action film directed by Richard Fleischer. The film introduces Brigitte Nielsen as the title character with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sandahl Bergman, Ronald Lacey, Ernie Reyes, Jr., Paul L. Smith and Pat Roach in supporting roles. The film features the sword-wielding Marvel Comics character Red Sonja, created by Roy Thomas, who first appeared in Marvel's \"Conan the Barbarian\" series (#23) in 1973. The film's character of Red Sonja was based on Red Sonya of Rogatino, a character created by Robert E. Howard appearing in his short story \"The Shadow of the Vulture\" (1934). The film acknowledges that it was \"based on the character created by Robert E. Howard\" in the introductory credits.\n\nAs in Howard's stories of Conan, the film takes place in the Hyborian Age, a fictional prehistoric time that had been depicted previously in the films \"Conan the Barbarian\" and \"Conan the Destroyer\".\n\nSonja, a young, red-haired woman, is raped and left for dead by the soldiers of Queen Gedren, a despot who murdered Sonja's parents and brother after she scarred the queen's face in rejection of her sexual advances. Answering her cry for revenge, the red goddess Scáthach appears to her and gives her heightened strength, stamina, agility and fighting skills on the condition that she never lie with a man unless he defeats her in fair combat. She trains under a sword master called \"The Grand Master\" and is distrustful of all men besides him. At a nearby temple, Varna, Sonja's sister, is a member of an order of priestesses who are preparing to banish a mystical light-powered relic, the Talisman, that created the world and all living things. The Talisman can only be used and touched by women – men vanish if they touch it – and has become too powerful to control. However, Gedren's army and her aide-de-camp Ikol intervene and slaughter the priestesses and shield maidens before they can imprison it to permanent darkness. \n\nVarna watches Gedren steal the Talisman before escaping, but is mortally wounded. She is discovered by Kalidor, the Lord of Hyrkania, who goes to find Sonya and bring her back to Varna. Before dying, Varna tells Sonja to find the Talisman and send it into darkness before it ravages the world with storms and earthquakes. Kalidor asks to accompany her, but she rejects the offer. After witnessing the Talisman in use, Sonja arrives to the now-ruined kingdom of Hablock. She meets the young Prince Tarn and his servant Falkon, who say that Gedren used the Talisman to completely decimate Hablock when Tarn refused to surrender. Tarn, demanding vengeance, announces that he will crush Gedren and invites Sonja to work for him as a cook. She politely declines before being told that Gedren is based in Berkubane, the land of Perpetual Night.\n\nArriving at the mountain gate, Sonja fights Lord Brytag after he refuses her passage for not paying him a 'tender tribute'. When she kills him and takes his key, his troops surround her; Kalidor, who has secretly been following her, attacks their rear, allowing Sonja to escape. Sonja comes across Tarn again, being tortured by bandits. She frees Tarn and kills the bandits with Falkon. They decide to stay together and travel onward toward Berkubane. Gedren's wizard uses a large magic dish to show the approaching party; Gedren recognizes Sonja and orders that she be brought to the fortress unharmed. Using the Talisman to conjure up a storm, she forces Sonja's group to take shelter in a watery cavern where an \"Icthyan Killing Machine\" is unleashed upon them. Kalidor appears and helps Sonja blind the beast so they can escape.\n\nSonja accepts Kalidor's company after learning he is a descendant of the lords who entrusted the Talisman to the priestess temple. He flirts with her, so she warns him that \"no man can have her\" unless he can defeat her in a sword fight. Kalidor challenges her and they fight to a draw. The party arrives at Castle Berkubane and, to protect Tarn, they convince him to stay behind and guard the front entrance. Ikol, realizing Gedren is insane when she refuses his pleas to stop utilizing the unstable relic, plans to escape the castle with bags of Hablock's gold. Sonja confronts Gedren in her council chamber while Kalidor and Falkon deal with her guards in the castle's dining hall. Ikol is stopped by Tarn at the entrance and meets an unpleasant end.\n\nNo match for Sonja, Gedren flees to the Chamber of Lights where the Talisman is stored. Now powerful beyond control, the Talisman causes the floor to split open and reveal a chasm of molten lava beneath the castle. Sonja and Gedren duel in the Chamber; Sonja runs Gedren through with her sword, sending the evil ruler plunging into the lava below. Sonja throws the Talisman in after her, destroying it and starting a chain reaction that tears Castle Berkubane apart. The heroes manage to escape as the castle is consumed by the rising volcano. Prince Tarn and Falkon eventually depart to rebuild Hablock while Sonja and Kalidor halfheartedly spar again before kissing.\n\n\nIn \"Conan the Barbarian\", Sandahl Bergman played Valeria, a thief and the love of Conan's life. Bergman was offered the role of Red Sonja, but turned it down, choosing instead to play the villainous Queen Gedren. De Laurentiis met with actress Laurene Landon and was set to offer her the role of Red Sonja until he discovered she was in an earlier film called \"Hundra\"; fearing that it was too similar, de Laurentiis decided not to give her the part. On a 2015 episode of \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\", soap opera actress Eileen Davidson revealed that she auditioned for the role and was actually runner-up to Brigitte Nielsen. It took Laurentiis almost a year to find an actress \"Amazonian\" enough to play the title character; he was still looking, eight weeks before the scheduled production, when he saw Brigitte Nielsen on the cover of a fashion magazine. The 21-year-old native of Helsingør, Denmark, in Milan for a modeling job, soon found herself on a plane heading for Rome and a successful screen test.\n\nGeorge MacDonald Fraser, who had recently adapted \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\" for De Laurentiis, was hired to work on the script during filming.\n\nSeveral scenes were shot in Italy, around the Gran Sasso massif (Celano, Campo Felice and Campo Imperatore), and in studios in Rome.\n\nThe musical score of \"Red Sonja\" was composed and conducted by Ennio Morricone.\n\nTrack listing for the first release on LP\n\nTrack listing for the CD release\n\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 15% based on 27 reviews, with the site's critical consensus stating, \"Dull, poorly directed, and badly miscast, \"Red Sonja\" is an uninspired conclusion to Schwarzenegger's barbarian trilogy.\" Schwarzenegger commented, \"It's the worst film I have ever made.\" He joked, \"Now, when my kids get out of line, they're sent to their room and forced to watch \"Red Sonja\" ten times. I never have too much trouble with them.\"\n\nJohn Grant, who authored the film's entry in \"The Encyclopedia of Fantasy\" (1997), gave \"Red Sonja\" a negative review, commenting \"Morally dubious (Gedren's lesbianism is depicted as one of her evil attributes) and worse-acted than words can explain, \"Red Sonja\" is a great embarrassment.\"\n\n\"Siskel and Ebert\" gave the film negative reviews. Both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert agreed the film was poorly made, but Ebert thought the film contained enough campy humor that he briefly contemplated that \"Red Sonja\" may have been intended as a spoof, with \"dialogue that sounds like the actors have already read the \"Mad\" magazine parody of this film.\"\n\nLeonard Maltin gave the movie 1.5 out of 4 stars and calling it \"Spectacularly silly...It might amuse juvenile viewers, but the only real point of interest for adults is deciding who gives the worse performance, Nielsen or Bergman.\"\n\n\"Phantom of the Movies\" Joe Kane wrote, \"An unwise return by Schwarzenegger to his first hit property. Only, instead of sword-and-sorcery, this is 'grunt-and-groan'...he grunts while we groan. Yet it should be noted, in Arn's defense, that he manages to stay off-screen for more than half the movie. Though the fur and heads fly in a few scattered battle scenes, the title character is wooden...and the film itself is clankier than a knight's shining armor.\"\n\nMarvel Comics published a comic book adaptation of the film by writer Louise Simonson and artists Mary Wilshire and Vince Colletta in \"Marvel Super Special\" #38. The adaptation was also available as a two-issue limited series.\n\nA second \"Red Sonja\" film has been in development for some years. In 2008, Robert Rodriguez and his production company Troublemaker Studios were working on a version that would have starred Rose McGowan as the titular character. By 2009 however, the Rodriguez project had been scrapped, and as of February 2010, rights holders Nu Image are moving forward with another projected new film, to be directed by Simon West. Producer Avi Lerner has said he would like to see Amber Heard take the role of Sonja, after having worked with her on \"Drive Angry\". Lerner says the film will shoot before the sequel to \"Conan the Barbarian\". In August 2012 at the premiere of \"The Expendables 2\" West said that the film was stuck in production. Christopher Cosmos has been hired as a screenwriter for the new film. \n\nIn November 2017, Deadline reported that Millennium Films will finance and produce a new Red Sonja movie with Avi Lerner and Joe Gatta producing alongside with Cinelou Films’ Mark Canton and Courtney Solomon and writing by Ashley Miller.. In September 2018, The Hollywood Reporter has reported that the studio are eyeing Bryan Singer to direct the film. The next month in October 2018, Singer is confirmed to direct the film.\n\n\n"}

Michael Fielding, Rich Fulcher and Dave Brown also performed in the show, along with the Boosh Band.\n\nThe show toured the UK and Ireland from September 2008 through to January 2009.\n\nThe show begins with Vince Noir (Fielding) and Howard Moon (Barratt) performing \"Future Sailors\" – Noir entering the stage in a large pirate ship, Moon following in a rubber dinghy. The first act of the show features a series of sketches starring a number of different characters. Bob Fossil (Fulcher) is introduced, and guides the audience through a series of moves from his Dance Academy. Naboo (M. Fielding) and Bollo (Brown) follow this, Naboo now a gangsta rapper in Los Angeles, and Bollo shows off his latest invention – the frisbee clock.\n\nAfter this, The Moon makes his first appearance; Tony Harrison introduces his own chat-show themed 'nugget' of the show, including a set from a Lithuanian taxi-driver turned stand up comic Kraków (Fulcher), and The Crack Fox tells a cautionary tale about a party lifestyle and subsequent drug use. When he leaves, The Hitcher is introduced, leading the Boosh Band on a performance of Eels.\n\nThe second act of the show revolves around a play written by Howard Moon about the end of the world, entitled \"No Future?\" Moon has enlisted the help of Naboo, Fossil, Bollo and Vince to perform the play, but Noir is quick to point out its ridiculous content, and hijacks the play by blackmailing Howard about a jazz-porn photo shoot he mistakenly got roped into.\n\nAt Vince's insistence, the cast (now with Brown out of the Bollo costume again) perform his play about aliens from the planet Camden. Vince plays \"Sunflash\" (who speaks with a Chinese/Chav accent, which Vince believes people will speak in the future) and Fossil as \"Booblay\" (a future pleasure-robot). Sunflash transforms the mutants from Moon's play into beautiful versions of themselves, thanks to his sponsor Jean-Claude Jacquetti. The increasingly humiliated Howard is made to wear a silver corset and blonde pigtails, and together with Dave Brown's Mutant character, performs the \"Mutants\" song from the first series.\n\nMoon tries to halt the play and leave the theatre, but is lured back in with a crimp. The Boosh Band reappears and together with Vince, Howard, Naboo, Bollo and Bob Fossil, they perform a medley of crimps from the series. During this, the Honey Monster appears, and the gang use Vince's giant Jean-Claude Jacquetti hairdryer to decapitate him and stick his head on a spike: a reference to a Sugar Puffs advertisement which they believed had plagiarised their 'crimping' style earlier that year. The band perform the song \"Nanageddon\" to end the show, sometimes followed by performances of \"I Did A Shit On Your Mum\" and \"Charlie\".\n\nThe previews and early performances were introduced by stage manager Bob Fossil, who would run through a series of safety features with the audience, before the \"Future Sailors\" number, but this was soon dropped. Over time, many sections become elongated – during the November shows, Bollo's frisbee clock joke was built upon greatly, for example.\n\nSome parts of the show were dropped altogether – previews included prototype versions of The Crack Fox sketches, but were replaced on the early tour dates by a sequence involving Rudi, who would then join The Hitcher during the performance of Eels. Also, early performances featured the Bingo Caller from Nanageddon instead of Eleanor.\n\nFor the DVD recording nights at Manchester Apollo on 3 and 4 December, The Moon's reworking of the Jay-Z track, \"99 Problems\", was removed due to copyright clearance, but it has been performed on almost every other night of the tour (apart from one of the early Glasgow shows where the Moon did not appear due to technical issues), including the other shows that week. Eleanor also switched from throwing her usual ballpit-style balls into the audience during the bingo section, instead throwing and kicking giant, numbered, inflatable balls into the crowds – on the DVD filming nights, these were also signed by the cast.\n\nSome sections change simply because of either audience participation, or due to mistakes on the night. Bollo tripping over the globe, for example, was added after Dave Brown slipped several times in early October, and by the end of the month it was a regular part of the performance. Similarly, Tony Harrison slipping in his chair, and the following dialogue, was added after Noel Fielding found it increasingly difficult to stay upright in such an enclosed space.\n\nThere have been rare performances of \"Love Games\" from The Legend of Old Gregg during the final band set.\n\n\"Boosh Live: Future Sailors Tour\" was released on DVD on 16 November 2009 with special and limited edition copies of the DVD being made available at the same time. Recorded at the Manchester Apollo on 3rd and 4th December, the DVD features the full show with commentary. The Special and Limited Editions also contain a bonus disc with backstage clips and scenes from \"Journey of the Childmen\", a documentary about the Future Sailors Tour. \"Journey of the Childmen\" was shown at film festivals and received a full DVD release in 2010.\n\nThe 'Normal Edition' includes the 2008/9 Live Show.\nThe 'Special Edition' includes the 2008/9 Live Show, the 2006 Live Show, and a set of Boosh \"Outrage\" playing cards in the style of Top Trumps.\n\nThe 'Limited Edition' includes the 2008/9 Live Show, the 2006 Live Show, a set of Boosh playing cards, and a Boosh belt buckle.\n"}

The episodes collected in the release form the middle of the series' mythology, and are centered on alien colonization efforts, the fall of the Syndicate, and Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) abduction.\n\nThe collection contains three episodes from the fifth season, five from the sixth, six from the seventh, and two from the eighth. The episodes follow the investigations of paranormal-related cases, or X-Files, by FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. Events covered in the episodes include the discovery of alien-human hybrid Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), the destruction of the Syndicate; the discovery of the remains of a spaceship in Africa; the fate of Mulder's sister, Samantha; and the abduction of the former, as well as the subsequent hunt for him under the direction of John Doggett (Robert Patrick).\n\nThe collection features the closure of several long-running arcs, as well as new introductions to the series' mythology. Series creator Chris Carter felt that the series' ongoing storylines were becoming too confusing, so he scrapped them and started over. Released on September 27, 2005, the collection generally received mixed to positive reviews from critics. William B. Davis, Mitch Pileggi, Nicholas Lea and Laurie Holden all play supporting roles in the collection.\n\nThe show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a former believer in the paranormal—having lost his belief in the fifth season opener \"Redux\", while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. As a rebel alien race secretly attacks several groups of former alien abductees, the agents meet Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), a woman who claims to be a multiple abductee and wants to deliver a positive message about aliens. Eventually, Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth about her abduction after Cassandra goes missing and her son, Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), angrily attempts to push his way up in the FBI. The Syndicate, meanwhile, quicken their tests for the black oil vaccine, sacrificing their own to do so. Later, the assassination of a chess grandmaster leads Mulder and Scully into an investigation that they soon discover strikes at the heart of the X-Files; they learn that the real target was a telepathic boy named Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka).\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Mulder appears before an FBI panel regarding his experiences in Antarctica, but is later denied reassignment to the X-Files division: Mulder and Scully have been replaced by Spender and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers). Later, Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection. The culprit is revealed to be Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system in order to achieve his goals. Mulder and Scully later learn of reports of rebel aliens burning doctors who were working on Cassandra. After finding her, she informs Mulder and Scully that the aliens are here to destroy all life on Earth and that she is a successful alien-human hybrid. The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder. Fowley forcibly takes Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to a Centers for Disease Control facility at Fort Marlene. Meanwhile, the Syndicate rendezvous at a check point, preparing to be taken away by the Colonists, who are prepping for invasion. However, they are met by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandra—save The Smoking Man and Fowley, who escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by The Smoking Man.\n\nSeveral months later, a metallic artifact with inscriptions is discovered on the beach of Côte d'Ivoire in Africa. After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he falls into a dangerous coma. Hoping to find a cure for her partner, Scully rushes to Africa and discovers a massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the ocean. Skinner and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) desperately attempt to find the truth behind the alien object. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder, but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. The Smoking Man has taken Mulder away to transplant the telepathic part of Mulder's brain into his own cranium, but the surgery is a failure.\n\nWhile investigating a bizarre disappearance of a young girl from her home, Mulder soon discovers the truth about his sister's disappearance. It is revealed that his sister was taken by \"walk-ins\", benevolent spirit who save the souls of children doomed to live unhappy lives. Together, Mulder and Scully locate evidence that proves that Samantha was abducted by The Smoking Man, and was forced to live in a now-abandoned US Army base. Mulder eventually is reunited with the spirit of his sister, allowing him to finally let go. Mulder and Scully investigate a case of alien abduction which leads them back to Oregon, the site of their first case together. While investigating, Mulder is taken by a UFO. Scully soon meets Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick), the leader of an FBI taskforce organized to conduct a search for Fox Mulder. Although the search ultimately proves unsuccessful, Doggett is assigned to the X-Files and works with Scully to look for explanations to several cases.\n\nFrom the third season to the sixth season, the mysterious Syndicate was explored in detail. In the two part episode \"Two Fathers\"/\"One Son\", the Syndicate was destroyed. The plan to eliminate the Syndicate and relaunch the series' mythology in a new direction was originally conceived in September 1998. Director Kim Manners stated \"I've said for years that the show really resolved itself, if you will, by accident. The whole storyline of the Syndicate and the bees and the aliens and the chips in the neck, they all seemed to just accidentally fall into place and create an intriguing, mysterious storyline that eventually got so mysterious and so intriguing that Chris had to blow it up, because he couldn't deal with it anymore.\"\n\nThe \"Biogenesis\"/\"The Sixth Extinction\"/\"\" trio of episodes started a new mythology for the series, questioning the origin of human life. Series creator Chris Carter claimed to be interested in the subject for a while, citing the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement in great extinctions that had happened millions of years ago. Carter claimed that early in the show he had met with a man who was one of the people responsible for leading the project of mapping the human genome and that he was interested enough in the subject to tie it into the show's alien mythology. The scientific basis for extraterrestrials pursued the writers to help Mulder an Scully's beliefs come together, which was furthered in the later seasons of the show. Frank Spotnitz claimed that the ideas used in this episode had been discussed between him and Carter for a few years, and had become easier to bring up after clearing away elements of the conspiracy in the episodes \"Two Fathers\" and \"One Son\".\n\n\"Closure\" was written to create an end to Mulder's quest for his sister, Samantha, who had been abducted when he was a child. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Spotnitz explained that, \"I think [series star, David Duchovny] grew tired of playing the man who is missing his sister. [...] I told him, 'This is going to be the last time you're going to have to play [that part].'\" Paul Rabwin noted that, \"It's been seven years. I don't think any of us are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away.\"\n\n\"Requiem\" was written as a way to potentially end the series. While filming was underway for the seventh season, many members of the crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, \"There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show that it was time to call it a day.\" Eventually, it was decided that Mulder would be abducted at the end of the seventh season, leaving things open for the actor's return in 11 episodes the following year. They eventually replaced Duchovny's Mulder with Robert Patrick's John Doggett.\n\nCritical reception to the release ranged from mixed to positive. Monica S. Kuebler from \"Exclaim\" magazine noted that, while the set was \"only for diehards, completists\", the compilation was \"the strongest of the mythology boxes thus far [released]\". She went on to name the \"Biogenesis\"/\"The Sixth Extinction\"/\"Amor Fati\" arc the \"best\" of the set. Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk, was more critical, however. He wrote that, although the story was \"interesting, intriguing, and entertaining\", the selection of episodes \"does not offer the same level of excitement\" when compared to the previous two volumes. He concluded by commenting that there is \"enough entertainment value for you to enjoy\". Keith Uhlich from \"Slant Magazine\" awarded the box set three-and-a-half stars out of five. He commented on the conclusion of many of the show's long-running arcs, and noted that Mulder was often only a witness to these events, such as the destruction of the Syndicate and the death of his sister. Of the latter, Uhlich wrote that he \"waver[s] back and forth on how emotionally effective it is\". He did, however, award the image quality of the DVDs four stars out of five and refer to their presentation as \"excellent\".\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\n\n"}

In recent history, the term has been used by critics of supply-side economic policies, such as \"Reaganomics.\" Whereas general supply-side theory favors lowering taxes overall, trickle-down theory more specifically targets taxes on the upper end of the economic spectrum.\n\nThe term \"trickle-down\" originated as a joke by humorist Will Rogers and today is often used to criticize economic policies which favor the wealthy or privileged while being framed as good for the average citizen. David Stockman, who as Ronald Reagan's budget director championed Reagan's tax cuts at first, later became critical of them and told journalist William Greider that \"supply-side economics\" is the trickle-down idea: \n\nPolitical opponents of the Reagan administration soon seized on this language in an effort to brand the administration as caring only about the wealthy. Multiple studies have found a correlation between trickle-down economics and reduced growth. Trickle-down economics has been widely criticised particularly by left-wing (socialist and social liberal) and moderate politicians and economists, but also some right-wing (conservative) politicians.\n\nIn 1896, Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan described the concept using the metaphor of a \"leak\" in his \n\nHumorist Will Rogers jokingly advised in a column in 1932: This election was lost four and six years ago, not this year. They [Republicans] didn’t start thinking of the old common fellow till just as they started out on the election tour. The money was all appropriated for the top in the hopes that it would trickle down to the needy. Mr. Hoover was an engineer. He knew that water trickles down. Put it uphill and let it go and it will reach the driest little spot. But he didn’t know that money trickled up. Give it to the people at the bottom and the people at the top will have it before night, anyhow. But it will at least have passed through the poor fellows hands. They saved the big banks, but the little ones went up the flue.\n\nWilliam J. Bennett wrote:Humorist Will Rogers referred to the theory that cutting taxes for higher earners and businesses was a \"trickle down\" policy, a term that has stuck over the years.\n\nPresidential speech writer Samuel Rosenman wrote:The philosophy that had prevailed in Washington since 1921, that the object of government was to provide prosperity for those who lived and worked at the top of the economic pyramid, in the belief that prosperity would trickle down to the bottom of the heap and benefit all.\n\nThe \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary\" notes that the first known use of \"trickle-down\" as an adjective meaning \"relating to or working on the principle of trickle-down theory\" was in 1944 while the first known use of \"trickle-down theory\" was in 1954.\n\nAfter leaving the presidency, Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson alleged \"Republicans [...] simply don't know how to manage the economy. They're so busy operating the trickle-down theory, giving the richest corporations the biggest break, that the whole thing goes to hell in a handbasket\".\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor in 1992, Senator Hank Brown (R-Colorado) said: \"Mr. President, the trickle-down theory attributed to the Republican Party has never been articulated by President Reagan and has never been articulated by President Bush and has never been advocated by either one of them. One might argue whether trickle down makes any sense or not. To attribute to people who have advocated the opposite in policies is not only inaccurate but poisons the debate on public issues\".\n\nEconomist Thomas Sowell has written extensively on trickle-down economics and loathes its characterization, citing that supply-side economics has never claimed to work in a \"trickle-down\" fashion. Rather, the economic theory of reducing marginal tax rates works in precisely the opposite direction: \"Workers are always paid first and then profits flow upward later – if at all\".\n\nThe economist John Kenneth Galbraith noted that \"trickle-down economics\" had been tried before in the United States in the 1890s under the name \"horse and sparrow theory\", writing: Galbraith claimed that the horse and sparrow theory was partly to blame for the Panic of 1896.\n\nIn the 1992 presidential election, independent candidate Ross Perot called trickle-down economics \"political voodoo\". In the same election during a presidential town hall debate, Bill Clinton said: \n\nIn New Zealand, Labour Party Member of Parliament Damien O'Connor has called trickle-down economics \"the rich pissing on the poor\" in the Labour Party campaign launch video for the 2011 general election.\n\nA 2012 study by the Tax Justice Network indicates that wealth of the super-rich does not trickle down to improve the economy, but it instead tends to be amassed and sheltered in tax havens with a negative effect on the tax bases of the home economy.\n\nIn 2013, Pope Francis referred to \"trickle-down theories\" in his apostolic exhortation \"Evangelii Gaudium\" with the following statement (No. 54): \n\nA 2015 paper by researchers for the International Monetary Fund argues that there is no trickle-down effect as the rich get richer: [I]f the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth.\n\nA 2015 report on policy by economist Pavlina R. Tcherneva described the failings of increasing economic gains of the rich without commensurate participation by the working and middle classes, referring to the problematic policies as \"Reagan-style trickle-down economics,\" and \"a trickle-down, financial-sector-driven policy regime\".\n\nIn the 2016 presidential candidates debate, Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of supporting the \"most extreme\" version of trickle-down economics with his tax plan, calling it \"trumped-up trickle-down\" as a pun on his name.\n\n\n\n"}

An excerpt from Capote's infamous unfinished roman à clef, \"\", recently has been published in \"Esquire\". Having recognized thinly veiled versions of themselves, Manhattan socialites such as Babe Paley and Slim Keith turn their backs on the man they once considered a close confidant. Alone and lonely, Capote — soothing himself with pills, vodka, cocaine, and chocolate truffles — muses about his checkered life and career in what is essentially a two-act monodrama.\n\nThere is one anachronism in the script. At one point Capote, talking about suicide, states he has stashed enough pills to stage his own Jonestown Massacre. The Jonestown Massacre did not occur until 1978, three years after the period portrayed in \"Tru\".\n\nAfter 11 previews, the Broadway production of \"Tru\", directed by Allen, opened on December 14, 1989 at the Booth Theatre, where it ran for 297 performances. Robert Morse starred as Truman Capote.\n\nIn his review in \"The New York Times\", Frank Rich said, \"Intentionally or not, \"Tru\" is a creep show: a hybrid of necrophilia and tame fan-magazine journalism that doesn't so much rekindle fascination with a troubled writer as reawaken the willies prompted by those disoriented talk-show appearances … that were the desperate final act of his career.\"\n\nIn place of a life portrait with depth, \"Tru\" settles for its wind-up Mme. Tussaud's caricature of the wrecked 1975 model Capote. This Tru is sporadically funny — if one shares Mrs. Allen's taste for the campiest of anecdotes and one-liners — and rarely boring. But since the soul of the younger Capote doesn't shine through as Mr. Morse's youthful spirit does, the potentially touching drama of decay is lost. The complex, possibly tragic figure of a wasted artist is replaced by a maudlin, some might say antediluvian, stereotype of \"Boys in the Band\" vintage.\n\nIn 1992, Morse recreated his performance for the PBS series \"American Playhouse\".\n\nMorse also directed a production of the play in Toronto in 1996, starring Canadian actor Louis Negin.\n\nRobert Morse won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show.\n\nFor his performance in the 1992 \"American Playhouse\" presentation of \"Tru\", Morse won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.\n\nBrian Griffin is seen portraying Capote in a production of Tru in the \"Family Guy\" episode, \"Da Boom\".\n\nGreg Kinnear is also shown portraying Capote in a production of Tru in the Farrelly brothers film, \"Stuck on You\".\n\n"}

Ganassa's real name was probably Alberto Naseli (also spelled Naselli).\n\nHe was known for playing \"zanni\", comic servant roles, hence his stage name, and is one of the first actors believed to have played the \"zanni\" subtype known as Harlequin (\"Arlecchino\" in Italian), which subsequently became one of the most important leading roles in Commedia dell'arte plays.\n\nGanassa is first mentioned in 1568 as the leader of a troupe in Mantua. After his troupe had performed in Paris in 1571, they were invited by Charles IX of France to take part of the festivities surrounding the marriage of the King of Navarre (later Henry IV) to Charles's sister Marguerite de Valois in August 1572.\n\nFrom 1574 to 1584 Ganassa performed in Spain during the reign of Philip II, where he exerted considerable influence on early Spanish professional theatre. He was so popular that the authorities in Seville withdrew the troupe's license: workers were neglecting their jobs in order to see the plays. Ganassa is mentioned numerous times by Lope de Vega, who may have based his comic servant \"gracioso\" on Commedia dell'arte types. The \"gracioso\" later became a stock character of Spanish comedia.\n\nDuring this time period, it was common for theatre companies to setup their stages right before a performance and take down everything immediately after. Ganassa recognized what a burden this would be and donated to the city of Madrid to create a theatre known as \"Corral de la Pacheca\", which is the first ever permanent theatre in the city of Madrid. Ganassa guaranteed himself tenancy in this theatre by a 9-10 year lease from its owner, Isabel Pacheco, by persuading the \"Cofrades.\" Ganassa also donated again to the Cofrades in 1582 to help build the second permanent theatre space of Madrid, the \"Corral de Principe.\"\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}
