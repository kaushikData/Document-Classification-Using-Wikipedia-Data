{"id": "157548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=157548", "title": "Allan Sherman", "text": "Allan Sherman\n\nAllan Sherman (born Allan Copelon; November 30, 1924 – November 20, 1973) was an American comedy writer, television producer, singer and actor who became famous as a song parodist in the early 1960s. His first album, \"My Son, the Folk Singer\" (1962), became the fastest-selling record album up to that time. His biggest hit single was \"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\", a comic novelty in which a boy describes his summer camp experiences to the tune of Ponchielli's \"Dance of the Hours\". He is not to be confused with the songwriter Al Sherman, who, coincidentally, also died in the fall of 1973.\n\nSherman was born in Chicago, to Percy Copelon and Rose Sherman. Percy was an auto mechanic and race car driver who, like his son, suffered from obesity (he weighed over 350 pounds), and died while attempting a 100-day diet. His family was Jewish. Sherman's parents divorced when he was in grade school, and the son adopted his mother's maiden name. Due to his parents constantly moving to new residences, he attended over a dozen public schools in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. He attended the University of Illinois, where he earned mostly \"C\" grades and contributed a humor column to \"The Daily Illini\", the college newspaper, but never received a degree because he was expelled for breaking into a campus sorority house with his then-girlfriend.\n\nSherman devised a game show he intended to call \"I Know a Secret\". Television producer Mark Goodson used Sherman's idea and turned it into \"I've Got a Secret\", which ran on CBS from 1952 to 1967. Rather than paying him for the concept, Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions made Sherman the show's producer. Sherman was reported to be warm and kindhearted to all who worked for him. However, differences occurred between Sherman and anyone who was in a position to try to restrain his creativity. As producer of \"I've Got a Secret\", which was broadcast live, he showed a fondness for large-scale stunts that had the potential to teeter on the brink of disaster. He once released 100 rabbits onstage as an Easter surprise for the Madison Square Boys Club, whose members were seated in the studio. The boys were invited to come up onstage to collect their prize. Although the resultant melee made a good story, it did not necessarily make for good TV.\n\nThe relationship between Goodson, Todman and Sherman became strained when he proposed that Tony Curtis teach the panel how to play some games he had played as a child growing up in New York City. However, Curtis had never actually played any of the games that Sherman had brought the props for. The props for Sherman's concept failed and the spot, which aired June 11, 1958, was a disaster and Sherman was removed as producer. Despite this, Goodson and Todman invited Sherman back several times as a guest on their shows in later years after he achieved celebrity status following the release of his albums.\n\nSherman also produced a short-lived 1954 game show, \"What's Going On?\", which was technologically ambitious, with studio guests interacting with multiple live cameras in remote locations. In 1961, he produced a daytime game show for Al Singer Productions called \"Your Surprise Package\", which aired on CBS with host George Fenneman.\n\nIn 1951, Sherman recorded a 78-rpm single with veteran singer Sylvia Froos which contained \"A Satchel and a Seck\", parodying \"A Bushel and a Peck\" from \"Guys and Dolls\", coupled with \"Jake's Song\", parodying \"Sam's Song\", a contemporary hit for Bing Crosby and his son Gary. The single sold poorly and when Sherman wrote his autobiography, he did not make reference to it. Later, he found that the song parodies he performed to amuse his friends and family were taking on a life of their own. Sherman lived in the Brentwood section of West Los Angeles next door to Harpo Marx, who invited him to perform his song parodies at parties attended by Marx's show-biz friends. After one party, George Burns phoned an executive at Warner Bros. Records and persuaded him to sign Sherman to a contract. The result was an LP of these parodies, \"My Son, the Folk Singer\", which was released in 1962. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The album was so successful that it was quickly followed by \"My Son, the Celebrity\", which ended with \"Shticks of One and Half a Dozen of the Other\", fragments of song parodies including Robert Burns' \"Comin' Thro' the Rye\": \"Do not make a stingy sandwich, pile the cold cuts high;/Customers should see salami comin' thru the rye\" and \"All day, all night, 'Cary Grant,'\" a takeoff on \"Marianne\".\n\nIn 1962, capitalizing on his success, Jubilee Records re-released Sherman's 1951 single on the album \"More Folk Songs by Allan Sherman and His Friends\", which was a compilation of material by various Borscht Belt comedians, such as Sylvia Froos, Fyvush Finkel and Lee Tully, along with the Sherman material.\n\nAs suggested by the albums' titles, Sherman's first two LPs were mainly reworkings of old folk songs to infuse them with Jewish humor. His first minor hit was \"Sarah Jackman\" (pronounced \"Jockman\"), a takeoff of \"Frère Jacques\" in which he and a woman (Christine Nelson) exchange family gossip (\"Sarah Jackman, Sarah Jackman,/How's by you? How's by you?/How's by you the family?/How's your sister Emily?\" etc.). The popularity of \"Sarah Jackman\" (as well as the album \"My Son, the Folk Singer\") was enhanced after President John F. Kennedy was spotted in a hotel lobby singing the song. By his peak with \"My Son, the Nut\" in 1963, however, Sherman had broadened both his subject matter and his choice of parody material and begun to appeal to a larger audience.\n\nSherman wrote his parody lyrics in collaboration with Lou Busch. A few of the Sherman/Busch songs are completely original creations, featuring original music as well as lyrics, rather than new lyrics applied to an existing melody. The Sherman/Busch originals – notably \"Go to Sleep, Paul Revere\" and \"Peyton Place\" – are novelty songs, showing genuine melodic originality as well as deft lyrics.\n\nHowever, Sherman had trouble in getting permission to record for profit from some well-known composers and lyricists, who did not tolerate parodies or satires of their melodies and lyrics, including Irving Berlin, Richard Rodgers, George and Ira Gershwin, Meredith Willson, Alan Jay Lerner, and Frederick Loewe, as well as the estates of Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein, Kurt Weill, and Bertolt Brecht, which prevented him from releasing parodies or satires of their songs. In the late 1950s, Sherman was inspired by a recording of a nightclub musical show called \"My Fairfax Lady\", a parody of \"My Fair Lady\" set in the Jewish section of Los Angeles that was performed at Billy Gray's Band Box. Sherman then wrote his own song parodies of \"My Fair Lady\", which appeared as a bootleg recording in 1964, and were only officially released in 2005 on \"My Son, the Box\". Alan Jay Lerner did not approve of having the parody being performed; however, he reluctantly settled to allow the performances of \"Fairfax Lady\", on the strict conditions that the show could only be allowed to be performed inside the Fairfax Theater, without any touring company, and that the musical could not be videotaped or recorded for any album.\n\nAlthough Sherman believed that all the songs parodied on \"My Son, the Folk Singer\" were in the public domain, two of them, \"Matilda\" and \"Water Boy\" – parodied as \"My Zelda\" and \"Seltzer Boy\", respectively – were actually under copyright, and Sherman was sued for copyright infringement.\n\nIn 1963's \"My Son, the Nut\", Sherman's pointed parodies of classical and popular tunes dealt with automation in the workplace (\"Automation\", to the tune of \"Fascination\"), space travel (\"Eight Foot Two, Solid Blue\", to \"Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue\"), the exodus from the city to the suburbs (\"Here's to the Crabgrass\", to the tune of \"English Country Garden\"), and his own bulky contours (\"Hail to Thee, Fat Person\", which claims his obesity was a public service similar to the Marshall Plan). Six cartoon bears were printed on back of every album.\n\nOne track from \"My Son, the Nut\", a spoof of summer camp entitled \"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\", became a surprise novelty hit, reaching No. 2 on the national \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart for three weeks in late summer 1963. The lyrics were sung to the tune of one segment of Ponchielli's \"Dance of the Hours\", familiar to the public because of its use in the Walt Disney film \"Fantasia\". That December, Sherman's \"The Twelve Gifts of Christmas\" single appeared on \"Billboard\"s separate Christmas chart. Sherman had one other Top 40 hit, a 1965 take-off on the Petula Clark hit \"Downtown\" called \"Crazy Downtown\", which spent one week at #40. Two other Sherman singles charted in the lower regions of the \"Billboard\" 100: an updated \"Hello Mudduh, Hello Fadduh\" (#59 in 1964), and \"The Drinking Man's Diet\" (#98 in 1965). Sherman's \"The End of a Symphony\", spotlighting Arthur Fiedler's Boston Pops Orchestra, reached #113 on the \"Bubbling Under\" chart in 1964, but did not make the Hot 100.\n\nThe songs on Sherman's next album \"My Name Is Allan\" (1965) were thematically connected: except for a couple of original novelty songs with music by Sherman and Busch, all the songs on the album are parodies of songs that had won, or were nominated for, the Academy Award for Best Song. They included \"That Old Black Magic\", \"Secret Love\", \"The Continental\", \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" and \"Call Me Irresponsible\". The cover of the album bore a childhood photograph of Sherman. That, and the album's title, were references to Barbra Streisand's album \"My Name Is Barbra\", released earlier that year, which featured a cover photograph of the singer as a young girl.\n\nDuring his brief heyday, Sherman's parodies were so popular that he had at least one contemporary imitator: \"My Son the Copycat\" was an album of song parodies performed by Stanley Ralph Ross, co-written by Ross and Bob Arbogast. Lest there be any doubt of whom Ross is copying, his album's cover bears a crossed-out photo of Sherman. One of the songs on this album is a fat man's lament, \"I'm Called Little Butterball\", parodying \"I'm Called Little Buttercup\" from Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta \"HMS Pinafore\". Sherman would later parody this same song as \"Little Butterball\" – with the same subject matter – on his album \"Allan in Wonderland\". The song may have had more poignancy for Sherman, as he, unlike Stanley Ross, was genuinely overweight. Sherman also parodied Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Titwillow\" from \"The Mikado\", in the song \"The Bronx Bird-Watcher\" (on \"My Son, the Celebrity\"), as well as several other Gilbert and Sullivan songs.\n\nIn 1965, Sherman published an autobiography, \"A Gift of Laughter\", and, for a short period at least, he was culturally ubiquitous. He sang on and guest-hosted \"The Tonight Show\", was involved in the production of Bill Cosby's first three albums, appeared in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and sang \"The Dropouts' March\" on the March 6, 1964, edition of the NBC satirical program \"That Was The Week That Was\".\n\nAlso in 1964, Sherman narrated his own version of Prokofiev's \"Peter and the Wolf\" in a live concert at Tanglewood with the Boston Pops under Arthur Fiedler. The concert, which was released as the album \"Peter and the Commissar\", also included \"Variations on 'How Dry I Am'\", with Sherman as conductor, and \"The End of a Symphony\". In \"Variations\", Fiedler was the guest soloist, providing solo hiccups. In 2004, Collector's Choice reissued the complete RCA Victor album on CD.\n\nSherman's later albums grew more pointedly satirical and less light-hearted, skewering protesting students (\"The Rebel\"), consumer debt (\"A Waste of Money\", based on \"A Taste of Honey\"), and the generation gap (\"Crazy Downtown\" and \"Pop Hates the Beatles\").\n\nSherman was often tapped to produce specialty song parodies for corporations. An album of six paper-cup and vending machine related songs, titled \"Music to Dispense With\", was created for the Container Division of the Scott Paper Company for distribution to its vendors and customers. It consisted of the tracks \"Makin' Coffee\" (a parody of \"Makin' Whoopee\"), \"Vending Machines\", \"There Are Cups\", \"That's How the Change Is Made\", \"The Wonderful Tree in the Forest\" and \"Scott Cups\".\n\nSherman also created a group of eight \"public education\" radio spots for Encron carpet fibers, singing their praises to the tunes of old public-domain songs. Entitled \"Allan Sherman Pours It On for Carpets Made with Encron Polyester\", it featured an introduction by Sherman and comprised the tracks \"Encron Is a Brand New Fiber\" (to the tune of \"Shine On, Harvest Moon\"), \"Put Them All Together, They Spell Encron\" (to the tune of Eddy Arnold's \"M-O-T-H-E-R\"), \"There's a Fiber Called Encron\" (to the tune of William H. Hill's \"There is a Tavern in the Town\"), \"Encron Alive, Alive-O\" (to the tune of \"Molly Malone\"), \"Encron's the Name\", \"Why They Call It Encron\" (to the tune of \"Let Me Call You Sweetheart\"), \"Encron, Encron\" (to the tune of \"Daisy Bell\") and \"Encron Is a Great New Fiber\" (to the tune of \"Take Me to the Fair\").\n\nSherman's career success was short-lived: after peaking in 1963, his popularity declined rather quickly. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, impersonator Vaughn Meader vowed to never again do a Kennedy impression, and perhaps because of this ominous shadow – Meader was a very popular parody impressionist of the day – and the resulting reluctance to book such acts, the public saw less of Sherman's type of comedy. Beginning in 1964, Sherman was among many American acts whose sales were affected badly by the British Invasion (which, in fair measure, Sherman skewered in the song \"Pop Hates the Beatles\", a spoof of \"Pop! Goes the Weasel\").\n\nBy 1965, he had released two albums that did not make the Top 50 and in 1966 Warner Bros. dropped him from the label. His last album for the company, \"Togetherness\", was released in 1967 to poor reviews and poorer sales. All of his previous releases had been recorded in front of a live studio audience – or in the case of \"Live, Hoping You Are the Same\", recorded during a Las Vegas performance – but \"Togetherness\" was not, and the lack of an audience and their response affected the result, as did the nondescript backup singers and studio orchestra.\n\nOn November 13, 1965 Sherman made a rare prime time television acting appearance in \"The Sheriff of Fetterman's Crossing,\" an episode of Rod Serling's short-lived Western series \"The Loner\" (1965–66). Sherman played Walton Peterson Tetley, a local schnook who went off to war and rose to regiment cook before returning home a hero thanks to tall tales and yarn-spinning. The town hails its conquering hero and Tetley is appointed sheriff. Series star Lloyd Bridges as William Colton, a wandering Union veteran, comes to town and signs on to be Tetley's deputy, discovering quickly his boss' utter incompetence in the office. Tetley receives a threatening note from a gunslinger challenging this purported hero to a gunfight when he arrives on the noon stage, at which point the story becomes a parody of iconic Western movie \"High Noon\" (1952). Colton sets to teaching the shivering-in-his-boots sheriff courage and gunmanship. Sherman's semi-serious and sympathetic performance was strong and his presence an affable one.\n\nIn 1966, Sherman visited Australia. He did a television series in Melbourne, Victoria, for a live audience. During the performance, he sang a parody of \"Molly Malone.\" It included a play on the word \"but\" (butt) which did not elicit a laugh. What Sherman did not know is that Australians use the word \"bum\" where Americans would say \"butt\" (although usage of the word \"butt\" has since become widespread in Australia). Otherwise, Sherman was well received by the audience. Afterward, he met with some of his fans and signed at least one autograph.\n\nIn 1969, Sherman wrote the book and lyrics – with music by Albert Hague – for \"The Fig Leaves Are Falling\", a flop Broadway musical that ran only four performances, despite direction by George Abbott and a cast that included Barry Nelson, Dorothy Loudon, and David Cassidy. Still creative, in 1973, Sherman published the controversial \"The Rape of the A*P*E*\", which detailed his point of view on American Puritanism and the sexual revolution.\n\nIn 1971, Sherman was the voice of Dr. Seuss's \"The Cat in the Hat\" for the animated television special. He reprised the role for \"Dr. Seuss on the Loose\", his last project before his death.\n\nIn his final years, Sherman's alcoholism and weight gain caused severe deterioration of his health; he later developed diabetes and struggled with lung disease. In 1966, his wife Dee filed for divorce and received full custody of their son and daughter.\n\nSherman lived on unemployment benefits for a time and moved into the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital for a short time to lose weight. He died of emphysema at his home in West Hollywood at age 48. He is entombed in Culver City, California's Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\nSherman was the inspiration for a new generation of developing parodists such as \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who pays homage to Sherman on the cover of his first LP. Sherman's hit song \"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\" has been translated into other languages. In one notable example, the Dutch-Swedish poet Cornelis Vreeswijk translated the song loosely into Swedish as \"Brev från kolonien\" (Letter from Summer Camp), which reached fourth on the Swedish popular music chart Svensktoppen in the summer of 1965 and is still popular in Sweden today.\n\nA \"Best of Allan Sherman\" CD was released in 1990, and a boxed set of most of his songs was released in 2005 under the title \"My Son, the Box\". In 1992 a musical revue of his songs titled \"Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah\" ran for over a year off-off-Broadway; other productions ran Off-Broadway for four months in 2001 and toured in 2003. A children's book based on the song \"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\", with illustrations by Syd Hoff, was published in 2004.\n\nOn March 14, 2006, National Public Radio profiled Sherman on \"All Things Considered\".\n\nIn 2010, eight of Allan Sherman's Warner Bros. albums were individually released on CD:\n\nSherman's son, Robert, later became a game show producer, producing for Mark Goodson during the 1970s and 1980s, including \"Password Plus\", \"Blockbusters\", \"Body Language\" and \"Super Password\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It evidently derived from the game of Brelan and later evolved into Bouillotte, which flourished during the French Revolution. Most experts believe that all these earlier card games played an important part in the formation of modern Poker, the most famous representative of a very ancient and always very popular family of games, all of which can be traced even further back to the old French game of Gilet (\"Gillet\", \"Gile\" or \"Trionfetti\"), which may be considered the most ancient European ancestor of Poker.\n\nBrelan is played by three, four or five players, with a 32-card pack, each receiving 3 cards and a fourth turned from the stock.

It includes, for example, rhymes and games played in the school playground. The best known researchers of the field were Peter and Iona Opie.\n\nThe subject matter of childlore includes the traditions of children between the ages of about 6 and 15 such as games, riddles, rhymes, jokes, pranks, superstitions, magical practices, wit, lyrics, , epithets, nicknames, torments, parody, oral legislation, seasonal customs, tortures, obscenities, codes, etc. as well as individual activities such as solitary play, daydreaming, fantasies, imaginary companions and heroes, collections, scrapbooks, model worlds, comic reading, mass media interests, dramatizations, stories, art, etc. \n\nAs a branch of folklore, childlore is concerned with those activities which are learned and passed on by children to other children. The stories and games taught by adults to children are not considered childlore except insofar as the children adapt and make them their own. In western culture most folklorists are concerned with children after they join their peers in elementary school or kindergarten. The traditions of childhood generally stop after the child enters intermediate school, which coincides with puberty and adolescence.\n\nOpie and Opie demonstrate that the culture of children is quite distinctive and is as unnoticed by the sophisticated world, and quite as little affected by it.\n\nOpie stated that the words of one game (Buck buck) had survived from the time of Nero. The conservatism of childlore contrasts with the way adult folklore is rapidly modified to fit changing circumstances.\n\n\n\n"}

The role of the costume designer is to create the characters' outfits/costumes and balance the scenes with texture and colour, etc. The costume designer works alongside the director, scenic, lighting designer, sound designer, and other creative personnel. The costume designer may also collaborate with hair stylist, wig master, or makeup artist. In European theatre, the role is different, as the theatre designer usually designs both costume and scenic elements.\n\nDesigners typically seek to enhance a character's personality, and to create an evolving plot of colour, changing social status, or period through the visual design of garments and accessories. They may distort or enhance the body—within the boundaries of the director's vision. The designer must ensure that the designs let the actor move as the role requires. The actor must execute the director's blocking of the production without damaging the garments. Garments must be durable and washable, especially for plays with extended runs or films with near-real time pacing (meaning that most costumes will not change between scenes) but whose principal photography phase may stretch across several weeks. The designer must consult not only with the director, but the set and lighting designers to ensure that all elements of the overall production design work together. The designer must possess strong artistic capabilities and a thorough knowledge of pattern development, draping, drafting, textiles and fashion history. The designer must understand historical costuming, and the movement style and poise that period dress may require. \n\nDuring the late-19th century, company managers in the US usually selected costumes for a show. Many were pulled from a rental house; few were designed. Though designers in other theatrical disciplines were recognized, few who specialized in costumes were. The few that were included Caroline Siedle, C. Wilhelm, Percy Anderson, and Mrs. John Alexander. They sometimes even received credit on the title page of a playbill rather than in the back.\n\nIn the 20th century, film costume designers like Edith Head and Adrian became well known. Later, those working in television like Nolan Miller (\"Dynasty\"), Janie Bryant (\"Mad Men\"), and Patricia Field (\"Sex and the City\") became more prominent, some becoming authors and having their own clothing and jewelry lines.\n\nProfessional costume designers generally fall into three types: freelance, residential, and academic.\n\n\nBoth residential and academic designers are generally also required to act as Shop Master or Mistress of an onsite costume shop, in addition to designing productions. In a resident theatre, there is almost always a shop staff of stitchers, drapers, cutters and craft artisans. In an academic environment the shop \"staff\" is generally students, who are learning about costume design and construction. Most universities require costume design students to work a specified number of hours in the shop as part of their course work.\n\nThere are two unions that costume designers can belong to:\n\nCostume Designers Guild, Local 892 is one union that represents Costume Designers, as well as International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and United Scenic Artists.\n\nMany costumers belong to the Motion Picture Costumers Union, Local 705 and represent every position within the costume department (except the costume designer). Local 705 represents Costume Supervisors, Key Costumers, Costumers, Tailor/Seamstress, Ager/Dyer, Cutter/Fitters, Costume House Employees and Commercial Costumers.\n\n\n"}

He is more commonly known as E. P. Christy, and was the founder of the blackface minstrel group Christy's Minstrels.\n\nHe was born on November 28, 1815 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Robert F. Christy and Ruth Wheaton.\n\nChristy began his career as a minstrel in Buffalo, New York. By 1836 he was a member of the Company managed by Edwin Dean at the Eagle Street Theater in Buffalo. He toured upstate New York from 1843 to 1845. The group took the name of its founder and became known as the Christy's Minstrels. In April 1846 Christy and his band of six performers began performing in New York City at Polmer's Opera House. The group performed at Mechanics Hall from February 15, 1847 to July 15, 1854. After performing at a benefit performance for Stephen Foster in Cincinnati, Ohio, on August 25, 1847, the group specialized in performances of Foster's works. Foster sold his song, \"Old Folks at Home\", to Christy for his exclusive use.\n\nChristy retired as a performer in 1855.\n\nHe operated a chain of theaters called Christy's Opera Houses in several cities. The name of the original group, Christy's Minstrels, was licensed for use by a new organization and became synonymous with the performance tradition of blackface minstrelsy.\n\nFearful of financial reverses due to the upheaval of the American Civil War, Christy committed suicide by throwing himself from a window in his home at 78 East Eighteenth-street in Manhattan, New York City on May 20, 1862. He died on May 21, 1862 of his injuries. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. His oral last will and testament that was made while hospitalized was declared void by the surrogate court when it ruled that there were no witnesses, other than the person providing the testimony. In 1881 his widow died and her will was contested.\n\nChristy is played by Al Jolson in the Foster bio-pic \"Swanee River\" in 1939. He also wrote the lyrics to \"The Yellow Rose of Texas\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1610168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1610168", "title": "Harold (improvisation)", "text": "Harold (improvisation)\n\nHarold is a structure used in longform improvisational theatre. Developed by Del Close and brought to fruition through Close's collaboration with Charna Halpern, the Harold has become the signature form of Chicago's iO Theater and the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City and Los Angeles. It is now performed by improv troupes and teams across the world.\nThe Committee, a San Francisco improv group, performed the first Harold in Concord, California, in 1967. They were invited to a high school and decided to do their improvisations on the war in Vietnam. On the way home in a Volkswagen bus, they were discussing the performance, when one of them asked what they should call it. Allaudin (Bill) Mathieu called out \"Harold\", which was a joking reference to a line from \"A Hard Day's Night\" where a reporter asks George Harrison what he calls his haircut and he answers \"Arthur\". Close later remarked that he wished he had chosen a better name.\n\nWhen The Committee disbanded in 1972, improv company Improvisation, Inc. was the only company in America continuing to perform Close's \"original\" Harold: a 45-minute free-form piece that would seamlessly move from one \"Harold technique\" to another. In 1976, two former I-Inc performers, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam, performing in San Francisco's The Old Spaghetti Factory through 1983. Spaghetti Jam performed Harolds while also turning Spolin games and Harold techniques into stand-alone performance pieces (i.e., shortform improv).\n\nClose and Halpern's 1994 book \"Truth in Comedy\" is the definitive text on the form. It describes a \"training wheels Harold\" as three acts (or \"beats\"), each with three scenes and a group segment. With each beat, the three scenes return. By the end of the piece, the three scenes have converged.\n\nA typical Harold is 25 to 40 minutes. Given three unrelated scenes A, B, and C, the structure follows:\n\n\nClose called this a 3x3 structure, using it to give improvisers a sense of organization to help them through their first Harolds. He was clear that the format was theirs to use. Departures were not only allowed but were considered important steps in developing a group's ability to Harold. He expressed this in \"Truth in Comedy\", noting that \"the first rule is: there are no rules.\" In performing Harolds, content and the need to develop an organic commentary on the suggestion trump predetermined structures.\n\nVarious Harold structures use different sets of guidelines such as the 3x3 format. Another guideline might be whether players stay as the first character they create or can play multiple characters, or that the ending is a group scene. Yet another guideline could be that everyone knows each other and scene partnerships may change from the first to second and second to third layers.\n\nThe loose structure allows for the creative bursts necessary for the Harold. Using an audience suggestion, players explore their relationship to the topic as a starting point. The scenes progressively evolve as the exploration continues to an ending point.\n\nThe basic form starts with an \"opening\". After eliciting the audience's suggestion, the ensemble explores it for a few minutes in either an unplanned or a predetermined structure. Textbook structures include:\n\n\nRarely is the opening just about the literal suggestion. The suggestion serves a starting point to discover greater underlying themes. Close stated that a suggestion should be elevated from the commonplace to the extraordinary.\n\nFollowing the opening are three completely unrelated two-person scenes. Each may use such information from the opening as:\n\n\nAs the suggestion inspires the opening, the opening is a launching point for the first set of scenes.\n\nFollowing the third scene, multiple members of the cast return to stage, for a group game based on the opening. A group game is a palate cleanser and should not relate to the established sets of scenes.\n\nIn a scenic group game, the focus jumps between all the characters participating. A textbook structure is the Advertising Meeting, where the entire cast must come up with an ad campaign for a new product.\n\nMore abstract group games are called presentational, which focus less on individual characters and more on a concept; for example, in \"slide show\", one improviser presents slides that are recreated by the rest of the troupe. Some other examples of presentational group games are\n\n\nThe second set of scenes heightens what was established in the first set. What it is heightening will differ from school to school. At the iO, the characters and relationships are heightened. At the Upright Citizens Brigade, the \"game\" of the scene is heightened.\n\nA tool for this is a \"Time Dash\", where the scene picks up at a different point in time than last left (for example, a scene between a newly married couple with problems can take the second beat to show them on their tenth wedding anniversary).\n\nAfter the second beat is another group game.\n\nThe final set of three scenes (the third beat) connects themes, characters, situations, and games from the whole piece. Often, scenes merge into each other, avoiding the need to return to all three. The third beat is usually the shortest.\n\nClose allowed for and encouraged much variation within the structure of the Harold, and he saw it as a malleable and organic form with which to explore themes and ideas. The beats and games need not appear in the order or number described.\n\nMost modern forms are derived from the Harold. These include: \n\n"}

The performance is noted for its split narrative with scenes branching to play simultaneously in an expanded performance space. The audience is mobile, able to follow actors and watch scenes as each individual chooses.\n\nAccording to Astrid Ensslin in her book \"Canonizing Hypertext\"(Continuum, London, 2007), the term hyperdrama \"was coined by hyperdramatist and theorist Charles Deemer, who understands 'traditional drama as a special case of hyperdrama' (p27).\" Ensslin places Deemer's one-act hyperdrama \"The Last Song of Violeta Parra\" in the canon of \"first generation hypertext.\" Deemer also has written a hyperdrama expansion of Chekhov's \"The Seagull\". In 2009, Harvard’s The American Repertory Theater and Punchdrunk performed \"Sleep No More,\" \"a hyperdrama rendition of \"Macbeth\" with a creepy, Hitchcock feel.\"\n\nDr Hannah Rudman, who wrote \"The Benefactor: a Hyperdrama\" in 1998 with Dr Billy Smart, describes the form this way: \"A hyperdrama is a play that is written in hypertext, that is performed as a promenade and that is realised on multiple levels. Scenes happen simultaneously throughout a performance space. In this hyperdrama, there are five different locations where the action takes place. The scripts for the different locations are divided into levels which represent the time span of the piece (about 45 minutes real time). All the characters and locations in this hyperdrama are of equal importance. As a reader, you could follow the path of one character through the play by clicking on their hypertext links; read all the separate scripts in a linear fashion; or explore the hyperdrama more randomly by swapping between rooms via the hotlinks.\"\n\nRussell Anderson, author of \"Woyzeck: a Hyperdrama,\" calls his play \"a performance in the ‘hyperdrama’ format: that is, where multiple elements of performance occur in multiple locations simultaneously.\"\n\nTegan Zimmerman uses the presentation software Prezi to explore \"Hypertext and Hyperdrama\" and their relationship online.\n\nOther hyperdrama works of note are \"Tamara\" by John Krizanc, which had a long run in Los Angeles in the 1980s, and \"Tony and Tina's Wedding\", perhaps the most widely produced and popular hyperdrama.\n\nA number of universities have added the study of Hyperdrama to their hypertext and electronic media studies: the University of Virginia, Tunxis Community College, New York University, among them.\n\nDiscussion of hyperdrama is included in the book \"Theatre In Cyberspace\" (Peter Lang, 1999): \"theatre practitioners are increasing their potential audiences with online technology while attempting to discover how to present theatre in an interactive yet non-corporeal way. Also fascinating is how educators and practitioners can collaborate, creating online performance spaces that can be adapted for teaching, and creating online teaching techniques that can be adapted for performance. This volume of essays presents information from some of the pioneers in the field of cyberspace theatre who write of their work in both theoretical and practical terms, thus creating a kind of \"Theatre and Its Double\" for computers and theatre.\"\n\n\n\npart of an MA Thesis on Hyperdrama\n"}

It was started by Keremane Shivarama Hegde in the year 1934. He is an exponent of this art form and is the first Yakshagana artist to win the Rashtrapati Award (President's Award), an award handed out by the President of India to people who excel in various fields. The troupe has survived three generations, with his children Shambu Hegde, Mahabala Hegde and Gajanana Hegde and his grand son Shivananda Hegde also being exponents of Yakshagana. Keremane Shivananda Hegde is the current director of the troupe and the institution.\n\nYakshagana is a folk art mostly performed in the coastal districts of the state of Karnataka (Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada districts), western parts of Shimoga district and the Kasaragod district of Kerala. This folk art is usually performed in the night and involves dances and dialogues with the accompaniment of music using traditional musical instruments like \"chande\",\n\n\"maddale\" and \"tala\". The unique aspect of the art is the use of elaborate headgear and dresses by the performers. The incidents portrayed in this art form are based on mythology and the epics. The performing troupe is called \"'Mela\"' or \"'Mandali\"' which is a traditional repertory and travels from place to place. A Mela or Mandali typically consists of 11-18 performing artists.\n\nIdagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali was started in the year 1934 by Keremane Shivarama Hegde, one of the exponents of the \"badagathittu\" style of Yakshagana.\n\nKeremane Shivarama Hegde was born in a Havyaka Brahmin family in Keremane in the Honnavar taluk of the Uttara Kannada district on 21 June 1908. He could not complete his primary education because of poverty and to earn a living he had to do odd jobs like driving a bus and booking tickets. He started performing Yakshagana from a young age of 14 and in the year 1934, he started his own troupe called as \"Idagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali\". The name of the troupe was chosen in honour of the Hindu God Ganapati. A famous temple of the God is located in the village of Idagunji in the Uttara Kannada district. He toured around the state of Karnataka with his troupe and started earning various awards for his efforts. He won the state award in 1965, Central Sangeet Natak Academy Award in 1970 and a Rajyotsava Award in 1985. The highest award won by him was the Rashtrapati Award. His autobiography called as \"Nenapina Rangasthala\" was recorded on cassette by G S Bhat in 1981 and published as a book by the Akshara Prakashana, Heggodu in the year 1996.\n\nKermane Shambhu Hegde is the son of Shivarama Hegde. He also entered the field of Yakshagana like his father and also earned various awards including the Sangeet Natak Akademi award. He brought in changes to the Yakshagana tradition by introducing truncated versions of the art form to make it more acceptable to people outside its traditional base. He established a school in his native village of Gunavante, Honnavar Taluk, to systematize Yakshagana learning. This (Srimaya Yakshagana Kalakendra, Gunavante), even to this day, is serving as a Gurukula and nurturing upcoming yakshagana artists. He went on to become the chairman of the Karnataka Janapada (folk) and Yakshagana Academy. Some of the characters portrayed by Shambhu Hegde are that of Balarama, Jarasandha and Duryodhana. He has also acted in films and won the Karnataka State Film award for his supporting role in the Kannada film, \"Parva\" in the year 2001-2002. He was a member of the Governing body of the South Zone Cultural Centre and also was a member of \"Rangasamaja\" which looks after the working of the repertory Rangayana.\n\nKeremane Shivananda Hegde is the son of Shambhu Hegde and is another exponent of Yakshagana. He has toured abroad with the troupe and was also invited to participate in the Asia-Pacific Performance Exchange (APPEX) workshop held in the University of California, Los Angeles. He has also learnt Kathak and choreography under the guidance of Kathak artist Maya Rao. He is the current director of the institution and guru at mandali's training centre- 'Srimaya Yakshagana Kalakendra, Gunavante'.\n\nThe troupe has given some of the most famous Yakshagana artists like Keremane Gajanana Hegde, Nebburu Narayana Bhagwath, Chittani Ramachandra Hegde, Gode Narayana Hegde, Keppekere Mahadeva Hegde and others. And also Idagunji Mela's impact made big difference to professional career of today's star artists like Balkur Krishna Yaji, Kondadakuli Ramachandra Hegde , Govind Naik Konalli, Uppunda Nagendra Rao,Ganapati Hegde totimane, and others. Sri Idagunji Mela and Srimaya Yakshagana Kalakendra, Gunavante served as a gurukula, nurtured and inspired many great artists in the field of Yakshgana.\n\nIdagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali has given performances all over India and overseas as well.

Today, it is prime real estate area surrounded by Mayapuri and Naraina.\n\nUprooted Lives: Delhi's Kathputli Colony Residents Watched Their Homes Razed to the Ground\n\nIn 2010, Government of Delhi initiated the redevelopment project of the colony on a public-private partnership basis. The contract was granted to Raheja Developers. As per the plan, 2800 flats will be built in 10-story buildings on the 5.2 hectares, apart from that a portion of the land will be given to the developer to construct its own commercial and residential buildings.\n\nAmid protests by residents and controversy, in early 2014, ahead of the 1 April 2014 deadline, some of the 2,754 families started shifting to transit camps built at Anand Parbat area 2 km away by the developer Rahejas. They are expected to stay here for the next two years, while the site undergoes construction.\n\n"}
{"id": "1494515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1494515", "title": "Les Luthiers", "text": "Les Luthiers\n\nLes Luthiers is an Argentine comedy-musical group, very popular also in several other Spanish-speaking countries including Paraguay, Guatemala, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Spain, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia, Cuba, Costa Rica and Venezuela. They were formed in 1967 by Gerardo Masana, during the height of a period of very intense choral music activity in Argentina's state universities. Their outstanding characteristic is the home-made musical instruments (hence the name \"luthiers\", French for \"musical instrument maker\"), some of them extremely sophisticated, which they skillfully employ in their recitals to produce music and texts full of high class and refined humor. From 1977 until his death in 2007, they worked with Roberto Fontanarrosa, a renowned Argentine cartoonist and writer.\n\nLes Luthiers began writing humorous pieces primarily in a Baroque style, especially imitating vocal genres such as cantatas, madrigals and serenatas. Later, they diversified into humorous renditions of music in other genres, from romantic lieder and opera to pop, mariachi and even rap. Their stage show is often intermingled with humorous skits, frequently involving absurd situations, the music and biography of fictional composer Johann Sebastian Mastropiero and a heavy reliance on fairly sophisticated word play. Much of the humor derives from the basic contradictions between the formality and highly developed vocal and instrumental technique of classical musicians and the sheer silliness of their show. All members of the group provided their voices for the pigeons in the Latin American and Spanish dubbings of the 2008 Disney film, \"Bolt\".\n\nLes Luthiers have acknowledged the influence of Gerard Hoffnung and Peter Schikele in their work. \"Professor\" Schikele invented in 1965 the fictional character of P.D.Q. Bach, son of Johann Sebastian Bach. He also invented many unusual instruments based in real ones, in the same style of the group. He also used the fictional biography of his imaginary composer as a running gag in his musical act.\n\nMr. Hoffnung predated both acts, starting in 1956 the Hoffnung Music Festival and publishing many cartoons with imaginary instruments for a classical orchestra. Malcolm Arnold probably was the first person to write a parody of classical music using odd instruments when he wrote for a Hoffnung Concert the score of \"A Grand, Grand Overture\", a piece for orchestra and vacuum cleaners dedicated to US President Herbert Hoover.\n\nLes Luthiers are known in particular for employing a diverse ensemble of invented instruments created from common, everyday materials. The group's first home-made musical instrument, the \"bass-pipe a vara\" (a sort of trombone), was created by Gerardo Masana, the founder of the group, by joining paperboard tubes found in the garbage and miscellaneous items. Forty years later, this instrument is still being used on stage.\n\nThe first informal instruments were relatively simple, like the \"Gum-Horn\", made with a hose, a funnel and a trumpet's mouthpiece, and some of them were born as a parody of musical instruments, which is the case of the \"latín\" (referred to in English as fiddlecan) and the \"violata\", bowed instruments whose resonating chambers are made out of a large tin for processed ham and a paint can respectively, the \"marimba de cocos\", a marimba made out of coconuts, and others.\n\nInventor and instrument-maker Carlos Iraldi (1920–1995), as \"Les Luthiers' luthier\", was responsible for inventing several more sophisticated instruments, including the \"mandocleta\", a bicycle whose rear wheel moves the strings of a mandolin, the \"bajo barríltono\", a Double bass whose body is a giant barrel, and others.\n\nAfter Iraldi's death in 1995 Hugo Domínguez took his place, and made instruments such as the \"desafinaducha\", the \"nomeolbídet\" etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1943, he co-founded the Grade Organisation (also known as Lew and Leslie Grade Ltd) with his elder brother, the impresario and producer Lew Grade (1906–98). During the 1940s, the company became the UK's most successful light entertainment talent agency.\n\nGrade, the youngest of three brothers, was born in London in 1916, four years after his Jewish family had emigrated from Tokmak, Ukraine—then Imperial Russian territory—in response to pogroms. Leslie and his siblings, Lew and Bernard (1909–94), were raised in Stepney. While their parents, Isaac and Olga, worked in the textile industry, the brothers left school at the age of 14 to establish themselves in showbusiness.\n\nWith Lew, Grade became one of the UK's best-known and most respected media executives. During the late 1940s, his clients included Jack Benny, Bob Hope and Danny Kaye. In the 1950s and 1960s, many artists represented by Grade appeared in the variety show \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\", broadcast by Lew's ITV franchisee Associated Television (ATV).\n\nGrade's son Michael Grade is a former television executive who has held top-ranking posts within the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. Leslie Grade's first wife Lynn Smith left him for the wrestling commentator Kent Walton (whom she married in 1949). Grade had two additional children by his second marriage, to Audrey Smith: theatrical agent Anita Grade (now Land) and Antony Grade, formerly Vice-President of Exterior Design for Renault and currently Head of Design for Avtovaz. With his friend Harry Zussman, Grade served, for many years, as a Director of Leyton Orient F.C.\n\nGrade's career was curtailed by a series of strokes in the mid-1960s, and the ownership of the Grade Organisation passed to Michael in 1966. It was part sold the following year, and renamed London Management under Michael's direction. Grade died in France in 1979. Unlike his brothers, he was not awarded a peerage or a knighthood.\n"}

{"id": "2697757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2697757", "title": "Minipops", "text": "Minipops\n\nMinipops was a television series broadcast in 1983 on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. Designed primarily for younger viewers, it consisted of music performances on a brightly coloured set featuring preteen children singing then-contemporary pop music hits and older classics. The children were usually made to look like the original performers, including clothing and make-up. Controversy over children singing songs that often contained a subtext of adult content (in adult costumes and make-up) led to the show's cancellation after one series.\n\n\"Minipops\" was the brainchild of Martin Wyatt, who created a new kid group from London called the MiniPops and released an album in 1982 which reached the top 30 in the UK and Europe. This resulted in a French record label releasing a single from the album, \"Stupid Cupid\", which was sung by Martin Wyatt's young daughter Jo. The song reached number 1 in France, knocking \"Ebony and Ivory\" off the top spot.\n\nHead of Entertainment Cecil Korer at Channel 4 and record producer Mike Mansfield embraced the idea of producing a TV show around the MiniPops; Korer believed it would boost and broaden the group's audience appeal. On 4 July 1982, thousands of amateur child performers from across Britain descended on a London theatre for the audition in a search to find additional children to sing and star in the television show with the original five members of the group.\n\nThough the series was a success for Channel 4 (gaining 2,000,000 viewers), little thought was given to the ethics of child performers singing songs originally written for older artists and dressing and dancing in a provocative style (often influenced by the original performance).\nWhilst embraced by children who loved the idea of ordinary children singing and dancing (as they did) along with their favourite songs, the show sat uneasily with some adults; this was capped by a performance from Joanna Fisher, who covered the Sheena Easton song \"9 to 5\" (known as \"Morning Train\" in the U.S.) in nightclothes and included the lyrics \"night time is the right time, we make love\".\n\nIn response, the programme began attracting criticism from commentators in the British media who suggested that portraying children in this manner (singing songs which often contained a subtext of adult content, often in unsuitable costumes and heavy make-up) was somewhat sinister (one caller on Channel 4's \"Right to Reply\" programme fumed, \"\"Minipops\" should be called \"MiniWhores\". Are you people out of your mind?\"). Also, the \"Daily Mail\" charged \"Minipops\" with partial responsibility for \"the slaying of childhood\". \nThe following is an excerpt from \"The Observer\" article of 27 February 1983:\n\n\"Is it merely priggish to feel queasy at the sight of primary school minxes with rouged cheeks, eye make-up and full-gloss lipstick belting out songs like torch singers and waggling those places where they will eventually have places? The final act of last week's show featured a chubby blonde totlette, thigh-high to a paedophile, in a ra-ra skirt and high heels; her black knickers were extensively flashed as she bounced around singing the words 'See that guy all dressed in green/He's not a man, he's a loving machine.' Kiddie porn, a shop-window full of junior jailbait? And does the show thrust premature sexual awareness onto its wide-eyed performers?\"\n\nThe child cast and the show's creators were somewhat shocked at the response and their misinterpretation, despite the ratings success. When Cecil Korer was replaced by Mike Bolland as head of entertainment for Channel 4, he cancelled plans for a second series.\n\nSeven albums were produced and released in the UK, Europe and Canada.\n\nBefore the television show:\n\nAfter the television show:\n\nIn Canada \"We're the Mini Pops\" was successful, becoming the third-highest-selling album in Canada at the time. This prompted the Minipops to hold a three-week tour in 1983, enjoying controversy-free success.\n\nA number of singles were released across Europe.\n\nOn 11 October 2005, Channel 4 screened a follow-up programme called \"Whatever Happened to the Minipops?\". This featured a history of the show, interviews with the former Minipops and crew and a reunion at the original theatre where the programme was filmed.\n\nIn 1994 the BBC comedy \"The Day Today\" parodied the Minipops. The satirical news programme advertised a fictional \"Attitudes Night\" on BBC2, which looked back at past television shows to illustrate how attitudes had changed. One such example was the programme \"Kiddystare, Channel Four, 1983\" in which nude toddlers romped for the pleasure of adults.\n\n\n"}

Her primary on-stage puppets are a white-haired Scottish grandmother named Granny and a deadpan monkey named Monk.\n\nConti was born and raised in Hampstead, London, the daughter of actors Tom Conti and Kara Wilson. She was educated at King Alfred School, London, and graduated with a first class honours degree in Philosophy from the University of East Anglia in 1995.

Her radio performances include characters in Radio 4 comedy \"Clare in the Community\".\n\nConti and Monk portrayed a morning weather team on the fictional \"Wake Up L.A.\" in Christopher Guest's 2006 film, \"For Your Consideration\".\n\nConti was awarded joint \"Best Performance\" in the Maverick Movie Awards for \"Her Master's Voice\", a 2012 film.\n\nIn 2013, she portrayed the part of Bea Chadwick in Christopher Guest's HBO mockumentary \"Family Tree\".\n\nIn 2002, Conti won the BBC New Comedy Awards, came second in the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year and came third in \"Laughing Horse New Act of the Year\" competitions.\n\nConti regularly headlines at London comedy venues and has appeared at The Comedy Store.\n\nShe took her first solo full-length show, \"Complete and Utter Conti\", to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2007, where she introduced some new characters as well as performing familiar routines. In 2008 she won the Barry Award for this show at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, tying with Kristen Schaal.\n\nAt the Melbourne Comedy Festival 2010 she debuted a new puppet, an elderly woman who is her \"Granny\".\n\nConti and Granny appeared in episode six of the I series of the BBC comedy quiz show \"QI\" in 2011. On that episode, Conti noted that she inherited the Granny puppet from Ken Campbell on Campbell's death.\n\nIn 2012, Conti appeared in \"Russell Howard's Good News\" with Granny. She also used a mask on an audience member to persuade him to dance. On the series 8 premiere of \"Live at the Apollo\", Conti expanded the act to provide voices for two audience members in masks.\n\nIn March 2013, Conti appeared on \"Let's Dance for Comic Relief\" with Monk. She danced to \"I Like to Move It\" by Reel 2 Real.\n\nIn June 2013, Conti appeared on Channel 4's Comedy Gala.\n\nConti appeared as a guest host on the final episode of the ninth series of the BBC stand-up comedy programme, \"Live at the Apollo\", performing her act with Monkey and an additional dummy-mask routine.\n\nIn October 2014, Conti appeared on Channel 4's \"The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night\" raising awareness of testicular cancer.\n\nIn 2015, Nina appeared on BBC Four's \"Clowning Around\", where she trained to be a giggle doctor and clown, and performed to children in hospitals.\n\nIn May 2015, Nina appeared on \"8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown\" in Dictionary Corner and used Fabio, the show's regular prop guy, as a dummy.\n\nConti's radio work includes \"Clare in the Community\", \"Sneakiepeeks\" and guesting on \"Parsons and Naylor’s Pull-Out Sections\".\n\nConti's television work began in 2002 with parts in \"Black Books\" and \"Holby City\".\n\nIn 2003 she starred as Mary in a series called \"Single\", then in 2005 voiced characters in another series entitled \"Bromwell High\". In 2006, 2007 and 2008 she played a part in \"Blunder\", \"The Golf War\" and featured in \"Comedy Cuts\" respectively.\n\nIn 2013 Conti, along with her puppet Monk, played a feature role in \"Family Tree\" as Bea Chadwick.\n\nConti has appeared in a number of diverse forms of media including films, television shows, and shorts, listed below.\n\nMonk is a cynical monkey who is continually insulting Conti and swearing when he does not have his demands fulfilled. He often deliberately shows irritation towards performing on stage and makes Conti laugh at his words.He now appears in a new cartoon on TV series Pop\n\nGranny is an elderly Scotswoman to whom Conti refers as someone who is a lot like her own grandmother. Granny often chides Conti for the simplest things Conti has done; for instance, when Conti reveals she has two legs, Granny responds by saying \"Oh, two legs? You're spoiling me!\" Her main act is to telepathically guess numbers or words, which she always guesses correctly. She also talks about her dead husband, Frank. Granny refers to people with words like \"dear\", \"child\" or \"my daughter\". The original prop was donated to Vent Haven Museum in July 2009, in memory of Ken Campbell, from whom Conti received her, but Conti had a replica made which she continues to use in her acts.\n\nThe face mask, rather than an actual puppet with a personality, is a mask that covers the lower half of an audience participant's face and can be manipulated by a hand-piece held by Conti to make it look like the participant is talking. Conti often uses this to put the participant in awkward and funny situations, such as making them say that they want nothing more than to dance in front of the audience, while their body language suggests the opposite.\n\nConti was in a relationship with the comedian and actor Ken Campbell; from him she inherited his collection of ventriloquist dummies. She was married to Andrew \"Stan\" Stanley with whom she has had two children.\n\nOn 24 July 2015, Nina received an honorary degree from the University of East Anglia and was made a doctor of letters.\n\n"}

It is a company dedicated to the development and encouragement of new and existing talent in the arenas of film, design and music. October Eleven Pictures was set up by The Figgis Brothers, Jonathan Figgis and Jason Figgis. It was born out of their desire to write and produce feature films using the digital format in order to challenge the tried and tested formula of 35mm film. They believe that the future of film-making lies in this area as the restrictions of the spiralling cost of 35mm film (all too often the cause of the increasing number of Hollywood flops) has been one of the reasons for the unfortunate dampening of creativity in movie-making circles. \n\nThey asked themselves the question: How many times has a brilliant idea been levelled by the restrictions of a budget? Digital technology answers the question of how to make an excellent quality film on tight finances. With the advent of 3chip DV, original ideas were finally beginning to be realized.\n\nIt was the Figgis Brothers childhood dreams of making movies and the advent of digital technology lead them to set up the company in February 2001. Jason directs while his younger brother Jonathan produces.

It is the third instalment in the \"Once Upon a Time in China\" film series.\n\nThe film is set in China in the late 19th century during the Qing dynasty when Chinese sovereignty is being eroded by foreign imperialism. Empress Dowager Cixi and Li Hongzhang decide to stage a lion dance competition to showcase Chinese martial arts and restore national pride. Interested parties from all over China are invited to participate and compete for the title of \"Lion Dance King\".\n\nWong Fei-hung travels from Foshan to Beijing with his romantic interest 13th Aunt and apprentice Leung Foon to meet his father, Wong Kei-ying, at the Cantonese Ten Tigers Association. At the train station, 13th Aunt meets Tomanovsky, a Russian diplomat, who was her classmate when she was studying in Britain. He starts vying for her attention and annoys Wong, who is disgusted by the Western custom of kissing a woman's hand. When Wong reaches the Cantonese Ten Tigers Association, he learns that his father has been attacked by a wealthy rival martial artist, Chiu Tin-bak, and Chiu's henchman, Kwai Geuk-chat, a.k.a Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat (due to his disability and deformation, clubfoot, as he is the 7th member of Chiu Tin-bak's apprentices, disciples and henchmen, which is how he was nicknamed), but sustained only minor injuries. Wong Kei-ying decides to give his blessings to his son and 13th Aunt when he sees they are becoming closer to each other.\n\nBefore the competition officially begins, all the lion dance troupes that have gathered in Beijing are already fighting among themselves and holding another competition of their own. Wong does not participate and spectates instead. Unknown to him, Leung and his friends have secretly joined the competition out of mischief. A short chase takes place between Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat and Leung when the latter annoys the former during the contest and flees. Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat's legs are crushed when Leung accidentally releases a stampede of horses from a stable. Chiu abandons Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat when he sees that he is now a useless cripple. Wong takes pity on Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat, brings him in, and heals his legs. Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat is initially hostile towards Wong, but he feels so touched and grateful to Wong that he starts bawling emotionally, and becomes Wong's new apprentice.\n\nWith the aid of a camera given to her by Tomanovsky, 13th Aunt inadvertently uncovers a plot to assassinate Li Hongzhang during the competition and learns that Tomanovsky is one of the conspirators. She warns Wong, who joins the contest to stop the assassins. In the final round of the competition, Wong, Leung and Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat fight with dozens of rival lion dancers as they battle their way to the top of a scaffold. Chiu also joins the competition and carries a large and deadly lion mask. Wong ultimately defeats Chiu and wins the competition.\n\nIn the meantime, Tomanovsky fails to assassinate Li Hongzhang and is shot dead by his fellow Russians, who confirm their suspicions that he is a spy working for the Japanese embassy. Wong refuses to accept the prize, a gold medal, and says that his victory is a Pyrrhic victory because the competition only led to greater conflict among the Chinese people. He throws the medal back to Li Hongzhang, turns his back on Li and walks away.\n\n\n\nThe film was released in Hong Kong on VHS by Paragon Films in 1996. The opening is in Mandarin while the rest of the film is in Cantonese. It was converted from a LaserDisc and some chapters are incorrectly arranged. The film was released again in Hong Kong on DVD by Hong Kong Legends on 21 January 2002.\n\nThe Taiwanese release of the film is in Mandarin and has 15 minutes more footage than the Hong Kong version. It was distributed by Long Shong Pictures and features a 4:3 cropped image with embedded Chinese and English subtitles, and the distributor's logo on the upper left corner of the screen.\n\nBoth the Hong Kong and Taiwanese versions were released on DVD in North America by Columbia TriStar. There is also an English export version of the film called \"The Invincible Shaolin\". In comparison with the original version, the end credits of \"The Invincible Shaolin\" are in English and some footage is cut out.\n\n"}

The SCG was formed in the aftermath of protests at Van Beuren Studios and Fleischer Studios, and represented workers and resolved issues at major American animation studios such as Walt Disney Productions.\n\nThe onset of the Great Depression in 1929 as well as bank holidays enacted by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 made it impossible for Wall Street investors to supply the major Hollywood film studios with the cash flow they needed. Studio executives cut salaries for their employees but took no cuts for themselves, leading to a mass spree of unionization in Hollywood. The executives retaliated by firing union members and picketers at a steady rate.\n\nIn Hollywood, animators were originally unionized under the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees in 1914. Noticing that there was not a union to solely represent animators, Bill Nolan unsuccessfully tried to form such a union in 1925, and a group formed by Grim Natwick, Shamus Culhane, and Al Eugster in 1932 was disbanded after executives began to threaten its employees and many members lost their jobs.\n\nIn New York City, where studio unions were generally better off, Bill Littlejohn, along with Hicks Lokey, John McManus, and Jim Tyer, formed the Unemployed Artists Association, which became the Commercial Artists and Designers Union (CADU) due to Roosevelt's policies, and later the Animated Motion Picture Worker's Union (AMPWU). These two unions were the most immediately approached in New York when employees were mistreated.\n\nIn 1935, Van Beuren Studios fired Sadie Bodin, an inker and scene planner, for pro-union sentiment, though she argued the Wagner Act prevented them from doing so. Van Beuren ordered employees to take unpaid overtime or risk being fired, and supervisor Burt Gillett treated them very poorly, having fired Bodin to replace her with someone \"whose attitude was better\". Bodin and her husband responded by protesting, becoming the first people to picket an animation studio.\n\nInspired by Bodin's protest, the AMPWU brought legal action against Van Beuren, but lost. Gillett subsequently fired union members and had them blacklisted so that they could never regain work.\n\nBodin's strike led key Van Beuren employees to leave for Fleischer Studios. The studio gave poor wages but generous bonuses and threw extravagant parties, though Max Fleischer's controlling behavior offended immigrant workers who had escaped dictatorships. When artist Dan Glass died due to poor working conditions, the CADU blamed his death on Fleischer and began protesting outside the studio. Fleischer retaliated by firing union sympathizers and quoting sentiment from anti-union employees in print.\n\nAt Fleischer, the first coordinated strike at an animation studio began in 1937 after the company fired thirteen pro-union employees. The strike lasted several months before Fleischer's partner Paramount Pictures intervened and demanded they sign a contract with the CADU. This led to better working conditions and a paid week of vacation, as well as holidays and screen credits, and previously fired employees were re-hired.\n\nThe events at Van Beuren and Fleischer led to the formation of the SCG in 1938, with Littlejohn as president. Herbert Sorrell later became president in 1941. The SCG became a chapter of the Conference of Studio Unions and was awarded jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to animation studios by the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe SCG was joined throughout its life by animators from Van Beuren and Fleischer, as well as Leon Schlesinger Productions (later Warner Bros. Cartoons), the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio, and the Screen Gems cartoon studio, all of whom it secured contracts with.\n\nThe SCG was instrumental in the strike at Walt Disney Productions in 1941. Studio head Walt Disney fired Art Babbitt for being a member of the SCG, prompting more than 200 employees to go on strike. The strike resulted in half the studio's employees leaving for other studios, such as David Hilberman and John Hubley, who formed United Productions of America. Disney himself was left with a permanent distrust of pro-union employees, and blamed Babbitt among others for the strike. \n\nThe SCG was succeeded by The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839, which still exists today.\n"}

Performers are paid either by the spectators or by the organisers of the show. A performance would involve an actual or simulated autoerotic performance or sexual activity with another performer. The performance can be on a theater style, or it can be in a peep show style. An increasingly popular form of sex show is a webcam performance in which the viewer is able to view and interact with webcam models in real time.\n\nSex shows are distinguished from entertainment such as striptease, pole dancing or lap dance, which do not involve sexual activity other than undressing and dancing nude or semi-nude. Sexual activity at sex shows is also distinguished from regular prostitution in that the performers usually engage in sex acts only with other performers and not with spectators or paying customers. Sex shows can overlap with other sectors of the sex industry. For example, a strip club may also offer live sex performances, and a prostitute may offer to perform sex acts with another prostitute for the gratification of a patron.\n\nIn Havana, Cuba in the 1950s there were sex shows and live pornographic theaters such as the Shanghai Theater and the Tokyo Cabaret. The English novelist Graham Greene, writing in his autobiography \"Ways of Escape\", described: \"the Shanghai Theatre where for one dollar and twenty-five cents one could see a nude cabaret of extreme obscenity with the bluest of blue films in the intervals\".\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s the Laotian capital Vientiane was famous for sex shows at ping pong show bars during the Vietnam War. Travel writer Paul Theroux described a bar in 1973 Vientiane thus: “Your eyes get accustomed to the dark and you see the waitress is naked. Without warning she jumps on the chair, pokes a cigarette into her vagina and lights it, puffing it by contracting her uterine lungs.\" British journalist Christopher Robbins wrote that \"The White Rose\", a famous Vientiane bar during the war, featured floor shows in which women used their vaginas to smoke cigarettes and fling ping pong balls.\n\nIn the Reeperbahn, the red-light district of Hamburg, several sex theatres (\"Salambo\", \"Regina\", \"Colibri\", \"Safari\") were once located in the \"\" (\"Great Freedom\") street. They showed live sex acts on stage, but by 2007 the \"Safari\" was the only live sex theatre left in Germany, and that closed in 2013.\n\nIn the red light district of De Wallen in Amsterdam there are three main venues for sex shows: a hostess bar called the \"Bananen Bar\", and the \"Moulin Rouge\" and \"Casa Rosso\" theatres which feature on-stage sex acts and variations on the ping pong show. In Thailand, locations like Patpong in Bangkok, Walking Street, Pattaya, Bangla Road in Phuket and Ta Pae Gate in Chiang Mai have numerous venues hosting ping-pong shows.\n\nSex shows are subject to varying laws such as licensing requirements and locations are subject to local zoning regulations. Some jurisdictions regard a sex show as prostitution. The content of a sex show may also be subject to national and local obscenity and other laws. Some areas allow striptease, but no sexual activity, others may allow only simulated sexual activity or autoerotic activity, while others allow anything that is legal in recorded pornography to be performed live. Generally, as of 2010, autoerotic activity is the most common legally-available kind of live sexual activity. In some cities and countries throughout the world, live sexual activity between multiple performers are legal. Webcam performances are largely unregulated.\n\n"}

{"id": "2886821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2886821", "title": "Sukisho", "text": "Sukisho\n\n, also known as Sukisho! or \"Sukisyo!\" is a light novel that has since expanded into a Boys' Love game (a type of Visual Novel), an anime series and OVA. The title translates into English as \"I like what I like, so it can't be helped\", or \"I like what I like, so there!\" The best known of the versions is the BL game, which features mild BL, and, in the original PC release, hardcore BL. The story is owned by SOFTPAL and Platinum Label, and the illustrations to the novels and games is by Tsutae Yuzu.\n\nHigh-school student Sora Hashiba was hospitalized after falling from the fourth floor of the school building. On his first night back in the dormitory, he wakes to find a strange boy addressing him by the name \"Yoru\". The stranger identifies himself as \"Ran\" and says he's Sora's new roommate. The next day, Sora's childhood friend and dorm manager, Matsuri Honjou, informs Sora that the other boy, whom Matsuri identifies as Sunao Fujimori or \"Nao-kun,\" is actually another childhood friend of Sora. Sora doesn't remember meeting Sunao before. In fact, Sora can't remember much of anything regarding his past, and the series follows his quest to regain his memory.\n\nSora soon learns why Sunao identified himself as \"Ran\" that first night: he and Sora have alternate personalities. Sora's is Yoru, a powerful protector and the lover of the more dependent, feminized Ran. The existence of these alternate personalities, and the relationship between them, has some mysterious connection with Sora's fall from the window and his forgotten past. The alternate personalities' passionate relationship is a far cry from the hostility and distrust between Sora and Sunao. Because Yoru and Ran possess them arbitrarily, Sora and Sunao frequently find themselves in embarrassing situations when they regain control of their minds.\n\nOther comical situations arise from Matsuri's efforts to draw Sora and Sunao into his moneymaking schemes, known as the group \"The School Do-It-Alls\" and from such minor characters as a bishōnen ghost and three younger boys who resemble the trio. No parents are ever mentioned, and the only authority figures are school nurse Kai Nanami and math teacher Shin-ichirou Minato, but it is known that Sora and Sunao are both orphans. Both have some connection with Sora and Sunao's dark past, which also involves one of the older students at the school, Kai Nagase, and a mysterious doctor named Aizawa.\n\nThe main character of \"Sukisho\". Sora can't remember his past and at first doesn't know he has an alternate personality named Yoru. Sora has spiky blue hair, blue eyes, and is usually easy going, and also loves to eat. As a dominant male, he has a complicated and occasionally hostile relationship with his roommate and former childhood friend Sunao Fujimori. Normally, he refers to Sunao by his last name, Fujimori. Sora also seems to be the character most often harmed in the anime. \nSora's alternate personality. Unlike Sora, Yoru is both shrewd and flirtatious. He is considered the seme of the couple. Yoru loves Ran, but he isn't above flirting with anyone. He loves Ran and will often show it when in bed with him (which embarrasses Sunao in the aftermath). However, Yoru will protect Sora when he feels a need. In the game, he also likes to joke around with Sora by placing images of Sora's friends in odd positions (including Sunao and Ran, Hiromu, Nanami, and oddly enough, Yoru himself). Yoru can be distinguished from Sora by his slightly darker hair, increased height, deeper voice and a glowing amber left eye. He is also usually seen with a long white piece of cloth tied to his right arm. In one of the drama CDs it is said that he tried to kill himself because he left Ran in the lab, and wears the white cloth as a memento. \nSunao is Sora's childhood friend and current roommate. Sunao has long pink hair usually tied with a long piece of red ribbon and pink eyes, and an alternate personality named Ran. Easily angered, he isn't above punching anyone who makes him lose his temper, especially Sora, who he punches a few times in the beginning of the anime series. At first, he claims he hates Sora, but he becomes closer to Sora with each game/episode, eventually consummating his relationship with Sora. Just as Sora calls Sunao by his last name, Sunao refers to Sora as Hashiba; in some episodes, Sunao calls Sora by the childhood nickname of \"Kuu-chan\" instead. \nJust as Sora has Yoru, Sunao also has an alternate personality, named Ran (蘭), which is Japanese for orchid. Ran is dependent, demanding and in some cases more feminine than Sunao. Ran is the uke of the pairing, and loves Yoru to the point of an obsession. He will occasionally flirt with Sora only to bring out Yoru. Ran can be distinguished from Sunao by his slightly brighter pink hair color (in the game), higher voice, and red eyes; in the anime, the red eyes are the only feature the two personalities don't share. Unlike Yoru, Ran never harasses Sunao, though he will attempt to seduce anyone else. Note that Kappei Yamaguchi is the voice actor for Ran in the Drama CD and games, but the same voice actor (Hoshi Souichirou) plays both Sunao and Ran the anime. \nA close childhood friend of both Sora and Sunao, Matsuri has long blond hair and green eyes. The dorm manager and head of the Do-It-All Club (in the anime), Matsuri always carries a camera, frequently taking fun (if embarrassing for Sora) snapshots. He's an upbeat person who likes to tease his friends, often inventing elaborate plans usually revolving around getting Sora and Sunao together, or making money. Sora and Sunao rarely like any of Matsuri's ideas, but the pair tends to go along with Matsuri despite that. Note that the Jack-of-All-Trades club that Matsuri establishes in the anime does not exist in the games. Also, he resembles Saotome Haruna from \"Mahou Sensei Negima\" in both image (Long hair with antennae) and \"Paru sama\" personality + Kazumi paparazzi.\nThe school nurse. Nanami is possibly the most feminine character in Sukisho (second most feminine would probably be Ran). The perfect housewife, Nanami cooks and cleans with a smile on his face. He lives with Shin-ichirou, whom he is in love with (they are seen sharing the same bed in the anime and the dramas show them to be married). He is very nice and easy to talk to, although he is constantly haunted with guilt because of his past where he worked with Aizawa conducting immoral experiments on humans in an effort to help Shin-ichiro with his own mental condition. There is hardly any difference between the games and the anime when concerning Nanami, but in the games he tends to be slightly more high strung (he can and WILL punch Shin-ichirou when he feels the need for it). Nanami has brown shoulder length hair (may be slightly longer) and blue eyes. \nThe school math teacher. He loves Nanami and cares very much for Sora and Sunao (who often refer to him as 'nii-chan'or \"brother\" though they are not blood related). Usually, Shin-ichirou is very easy going and somewhat immature, though caring. He will often flirt with Nanami, but most of the time in a playful way. He is, however, very prone to jealousy and he also has another side of him often referred to as 'Minato' or 'Minato-sensei'. As Minato, he is very flirtatious and will attempt to force people into sex (often Sora or Nanami). Usually, Nanami just has to mess up Minato's hair or punch him to bring back Shin-ichirou. In White Flower, Minato acts more evil and becomes Aizawa's slave after being brainwashed. Shin-ichirou has black spiky hair and blue eyes. As Minato, his hair is a lot more tidy and sometimes his eyes are pitch black. \nSora's friend, he is a year younger than Sora. He has a crush on Nagase Kai, manager of the Chemistry labs. He seems to be always happy, and he tries to help his friend any way he can. A sincere boy of pure feelings, Sora says that \"He expresses four times more his feelings than the majority of the people\". In the game \"Mou Matte\", Gaku is given the position of main character and must choose to either continue his relationship with Nagase (as the uke, or bottom) or start a new one with Shiina (as the seme, or top). \nHe is the chemistry lab manager. A quiet, serious and mysterious man, yet he is very intelligent and has gotten his thesis printed in numerous science magazines. Gaku is in love with him, admires him and is always praising him whenever he can. Nagase knows this, and takes advantage of this when needed. But finally, he changed because of Gaku's true love. He is the son of Professor Aizawa, the main antagonist. \n\nThree children who have become attached to Sora, Sunao, and the rest. It is unknown if Sei and Shiina have parents, but Kitamura has become Hano Yoshihiro's stepbrother (which he resents in the anime). Sei resembles Sora while Shiina resembles a young Nanami. Kitamura does not really resemble anyone, but fans have said he somewhat resembles Sunao due to his hot pink hair. After episode 3, they are never seen apart and seem to act identical for most of the series (except in episode 13, the OVA). In the games, their personalities are a lot more diverse and they are very similar Sora, Sunao, and Matsuri when they were in school. Sei acts the most immature of three (Sora), Kitamura comes up with various plans and likes to joke around (Matsuri), and Shiina tends to be the more effeminate tsundere (Sunao). They also live together in the same dorms. In the games and their teacher is Sora. Although not exactly related, Sei is sometimes seen as Sora and Sunao's child. In the games, Shiina also has a crush on Gaku and whether or not he ends up with Gaku depends on the player's choice (in both White Flower and Mou Matte). Kitamura can also end up with Gaku, but only in Mou Matte. In the game Sei is Sora's clone. He cannot speak first, but starts to trust Sunao and Sora after a while. After White Flower, the three of them are like a family. Ren (蓮) or (恋) means 'lotus' or 'romance, love' in Japanese. \n\nThe adopted child of Ayano. He is really shy and unexpressive, seems to be a chibi-Gaku as Sei-kun to Sora (chibi-Sora). The first time he smiled was when Ayano used his favourite plushie (a pink rabbit) to talk to him. Since then, Ayano always brings it with him. In the games and novels, Aizawa made Kano out of DNA from Gaku Ichikawa as he admired Gaku's cheerfulness. \n\nOccasionally appears in the game and makes brief appearances in the anime. Soushi is a lawyer who loves to flirt with Nanami. Most of the time, he playfully flirts with Nanami just to anger Shin-ichirou. Compared to most of the character, he acts a lot more refined, but he will occasionally get mad (especially if children are making too much noise). In the games, there are scenes where he and Sora have sex (depending on the choices the player makes). The PS2 game and the Drama CDs show that Soushi and Matsuri could become a couple. He is also the middle brother of Shin-ichirou Minato and Ryouya Kozuki. \n\nShin-ichirou's and Soushi's older brother. He has a psychiatric clinic and he does double-personalities-analysis to Sora and to Sunao (with Soushi's and Nanami's approval, though the same can not be said for Sora and Sunao). He brings always with him a pink rabbit and does ventriloquism with it to his adopted child, Kano-kun (seemingly a bit unexpressive and shy enough). Smiles often and loves children. In the games, he originally worked for Aizawa. \n\nA young boy who loves Sora (later on he loves Sunao in the game). He gets into an accident that puts him into the hospital. He then becomes a wandering spirit, but what he does differs between the anime and the games. In the anime, Hiromu haunts the halls of the school to find Sora. In the games, he possesses Sunao and tries to spend time with Sora (this is indicated by Sunao's sudden hair color change to white and the playful tune in the background). Hiromu acts very innocent and playful. Eventually, his spirit returns to his body. In First Limit, Sora can end up with Hiromu if the players makes the right choices. \n\nGaku Ichikawa's classmate, and is also close to Fuuta Kitamura. He is cheerful and enjoys chemistry, just like Gaku, and is the step brother of Fuuta Kitamura. In the games and novels, he has an obsession with putting pink bows in his hair. \n\nA character appearing only in the games and the OVA, he is a young boy who works at a nearby church and has a very close relationship with Sora Hashiba. In Target Nights, he became friends with Sora, but ended almost killing Sora and Sunao because he said that Sora was possessed. Later, it is revealed that Aizawa manipulated his feelings to get revenge on Nanami (who was Chris real target) to which Chris apologies. Chris also has a love interest in Nanami, the two where close friends when Nanami worked for Aizawa in the laboratory. On the next games, he became a recurring character and a real friend of Sora and his friends. \n\nAizawa is the main antagonist in Sukisho. He is a professor at the university which Sunao attends after the games, and the chemistry department advisor. Aizawa is obsessed with studying medicine and cloning and even invented medicine that can control the mind and emotions of human beings. Aizawa grew up with and became friends with Shin-ichirou Minato and Kai Nanami. Aizawa struggled with psychological issues, unable to function properly in public, and had issues handling his emotions. Aizawa had begun falling in love with Shin-ichirou Minato but failed to cope with such emotions. As he entered high school, he switched schools and Kai Nanami wound up working and studying under him by college so he can help Shin-ichirou with his schizophrenia but left after Aizawa attacked him. Aizawa became obsessed with causing Nanami pain and shortly after, kidnapped Sora Hashiba and Sunao Fujimori and had performed grotesque experiments on them when they were children. Aizawa has three \"sons\" whom are all clones by the names Nagase Kai, Cano, and Ren Shiina. Aizawa cannot also feel pain physically. Despite Aizawa being cold and collective, he is usually hyper and fun around Gaku Ichikawa and Nagase Kai. Aizawa deeply cares about the people around him, but due to his emotional disability, has issues showing so. Shin-ichirou's brother Ayano winds up working for him, claiming Aizawa was very depressed and lonely. Most of Aizawa's hate towards Nanami is mostly due to jealousy. By the end of the games, Aizawa redeems himself and happily works as a professor again, leaving the main characters alone. It's implied him and Ayano become a couple. \n\nOpening Theme: \"Just A Survivor\", performed by Tatsuhisa Suzuki. <BR>\nEnding Theme: \"Daydreamin'\", performed by Kishō Taniyama.\n\n\nCurrently, there are four games and one spin-off in the \"Sukisho\" series. The games were originally point-and-click visual novels released for PC, containing sexual content, though certain body parts are censored (as is all pornographic material in Japan).\n\nThree of the games have been released on the Sony PlayStation 2. The PS2 versions have been heavily edited and many new CG scenes have been added. In addition, they feature the voice acting from the Drama CD cast, which were absent in the PC release. These games do not yet have an official English translation.\n\nThe first game in the series. Sora Hashiba was put into the hospital for quite some time after falling from one of the school buildings. He didn't receive any major injuries, but he has lost some of his memories in the process. However, he continually sees a vision of him being carried through several dark corridors and the voice of someone calling out to him. After being released from the hospital, Sora heads back to the dorms to find that a new boy by the name of Sunao Fujimori, who will now be his roommate. He is told that Sunao is his childhood friend, but he cannot recall spending his childhood with Sunao. As he spends time with Sunao, he notices some strange things about him, including his transformation into his alternate personality Ran. On top of that, the spirit of a hospitalized schoolmate possesses Sunao and confesses his love for him. Depending on the player's decisions, Sora can either end up with Sunao, Hiromu, Ran, or Minato.\n\nAfter spending some time in Shin-ichirou and Nanami's place, Sora and Sunao come across a mysterious cosplaying bandit known only by the number 416. He claims that he has come to take away something precious from Sora. Meanwhile, Sora and Sunao meet Chris, who works at the nearby church. While he seems harmless, he begins to spend more time with Sora. To top it all off, Sora begins to realize that there are times when he and Sunao are mysteriously in bed together. He already knows about Sunao's connection with his alternate personality Ran, but could that mean he has his own alternate personality as well? Depending on the choices of the player, Sora will either end up with Sunao, Chris, Ran, Matsuri, or Minato. Also, obtaining all the CGs rewards the player with a special ending involving bandits 416, 773, and most recently 848.\n\nPossibly the turning point in the series. Sora and Sunao continue their life in school. All seems normal until Sora notices a child that looks very similar to himself. Also, some of his schoolmates are beginning to act a little strange. Even Sora begins to notice that something odd about his connection to Sunao and the relationship between their alternate personalities Yoru and Ran. Depending on the choices of the player, Sora may end up with Sunao, Matsuri, Soushi, or Minato. Collecting all the CGs allows the player to access secret endings that involve Sora, Sunao, Matsuri, Shin-ichirou, and Nanami banding together as cosplaying bandits 848, 370, 332, 416, and 773.\n\n\"Sukisho\" cast's status prior to \"White Flower\":\n\n\nThe final game in the series. Taking place a couple of years after \"Rain\", many changes have been made to the school. Not only is it no longer an all-boys school, several of the former students are now working as teachers while others move onto other jobs. Sora, as one of the teachers, has been living a fairly normal life as he takes Minato's place as teacher. However, he realizes that it won't stay normal for long when he sees that Sunao, who he has not seen since the events in \"Rain\", reappears in one of the halls. This game finally wraps up the story between Sora and Sunao and ends their conflict with Professor Aizawa. Depending on the player's choices, Sora can either end up with Sunao, Nanami, Hiromu, Matsuri, Soushi, or Minato. There are two hidden endings in this game. The Yoru/Ran ending is received when achieving the true ending, while the Kaito ending is obtained when all the CGs are collected.\n\nA spin off of the \"Sukisho\" games. Takes place some time in between \"Rain\" and \"White Flower\". The player now controls Gaku Ichikawa, one of Sora's friends who worked in the Chemistry Lab. Gaku must now choose whether to continue his relationship with Kai Nagase or start a new one with Ren Shiina. Depending on the player's choice, Gaku may end up with Shiina, Nagase, or Kitamura. Most of the main cast from the previous \"Sukisho\" games are visibly absent, including Sora and Sunao.

{"id": "676791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=676791", "title": "Termagant", "text": "Termagant\n\nTermagant or Tervagant was the name given to a god which Christians believed Muslims worshipped.\n\nThe word is also used in modern English to mean a violent, overbearing, turbulent, brawling, quarrelsome woman; a virago, shrew, vixen. In the past, the word could be applied to any person or thing personified, not just a woman.\n\nEuropean literature from the Middle Ages often referred to Muslims as pagans, with sobriquets such as \"the paynim foe\". These depictions represent Muslims worshipping Muhammad as a god along with various deities in the form of idols (cult images), ranging from Apollyon to Lucifer, but their chief deity was typically named Termagant. In some writings, such as the eleventh-century \"Song of Roland\", this was combined to create an \"unholy Trinity\" of sorts composed of Muhammad, Apollyon, and Termagant.\n\nThe origin of the name Termagant is unknown, and does not seem to derive from any actual aspect of Muslim belief or practice, however wildly distorted. In the 19th century, W. W. Skeat speculated that the name was originally \"Trivagante\", meaning \"thrice wandering\", a reference to the moon, because of the Islamic use of crescent moon imagery. An Old English origin has also been suggested, from \"tiw mihtig r\" (\"very mighty\"), referring to the Germanic god Tiw. Another possibility is that it derives from a confusion between Muslims and the Zoroastrian Magi of ancient Iran: thus \"tyr-magian\", or \"Magian god\". Joseph T. Shipley argues that it evolved from the Italian \"Trivigante\" and became confused with \"\", meaning boaster, derived from Hermes Trismegistus.\n\nIt has been speculated that Tervagant may be a corruption of the Gaulish god Taruos Tricaranos.\n\nWhatever its origins, \"Termagant\" became established in the West as the name of the principal Muslim god, being regularly mentioned in metrical romances and \"chansons de geste\". In the 15th-century Middle English romance \"Syr Guy of Warwick\", a Sultan swears an oath:\n\nIn the \"Chanson de Roland\", the Muslims, having lost the battle of Roncesvalles, desecrate their \"pagan idols\" (lines 2589–90):\n\nTervagant is also a god/statue of the \"king of Africa\" in the Jean Bodel play in Old French (c.1200) \"Le jeu de saint Nicolas\".\n\nIn the \"Sowdone of Babylone\", the sultan makes a vow to Termagaunte rather than Mahound (Muhammad) (lines 135–40):\n\nIn Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", the \"Tale of Sir Thopas\" (supposed to be told by Chaucer himself on the pilgrimage) is a parody of these chivalric romances. In the tale, a giant knight named \"Sir Oliphaunt\" is made to swear an oath by Termagant.\n\nIn Occitan literature the name Muhammed was corrupted as \"Bafomet\", forming the basis for the legendary Baphomet, at different times an idol, a \"sabbatic goat\", and key link in conspiracy theories. The troubadour Austorc d'Aorlhac refers to Bafomet and Termagant (\"Tervagan\") side-by-side in one \"sirventes\", referring also to the latter's \"companions\".\n\nIt has been claimed that Termagant became a stock character in a number of medieval mystery plays but another source denies this completely. On the stage, Termagant was usually depicted as a turbanned creature who wore a long, Eastern style gown. As a stage-villain, he would rant at and threaten the lesser villains who were his servants and worshippers.\n\nAs a result of the theatrical tradition, by Shakespeare's day the term had come to refer to a bullying person. \"Henry IV, part 1\" contains a reference to \"that hot termagant Scot\". In \"Hamlet\", the hero says of ham actors that \"I would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant, it out-Herods Herod\". Herod, like Termagant, was also a character from medieval drama who was famous for ranting. In similar vein Beaumont and Fletcher's play \"A King and No King\" contains the line \"This would make a saint swear like a soldier, and a soldier like Termagant.\"\n\nMainly because of Termagant's depiction in long gowns, and given that female roles were routinely played by male actors in Shakespearean times, English audiences got the mistaken notion that the character was female, or at least that he resembled a mannish woman. As a result, the name \"termagant\" came increasingly to be applied to a woman with a quarrelsome, scolding quality, a sense that it retains today. This was a well established usage by the late 17th century. Thomas Shadwell's play \"The Squire of Alsatia\" (1688) contains a character called Mrs Termagant who is out for revenge on one of the other characters, and is described as a \"furious, malicious, and revengeful woman; perpetually plaguing him, and crossing him in all his designs; pursuing him continually with her malice, even to the attempting of his life.\" Arthur Murphy's play \"The Upholsterer\" (1758) also contains a female character called \"Termagant\". In Washington Irving's \"Rip Van Winkle\", Dame Van Winkle is described as a \"termagant wife\". \"Virago\", \"fishwife\" and \"shrew\" are near synonyms for \"termagant\" in this sense.\n\nThe term is still sometimes used of men. In 2008, the Australian politician Kim Beazley labelled opponent Tony Abbott a termagant.\n\n is a longstanding ship's name in the British Royal Navy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45568", "title": "The Abyss", "text": "The Abyss\n\nThe Abyss is a 1989 American science fiction film written and directed by James Cameron, starring Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Michael Biehn. When an American submarine sinks in the Caribbean, the U.S. search and recovery team works with an oil platform crew, racing against Russian vessels to recover the boat. Deep in the ocean, they encounter something unexpected. The film was released on August 9, 1989, and grossed $90 million. It won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for three more Academy awards.\n\nIn 1988, the U.S. \"Ohio\"-class submarine USS \"Montana\" has an encounter with an unidentified submerged object and sinks near the Cayman Trough. With Soviet ships moving in to try to salvage the sub and a hurricane moving over the area, the U.S. government sends a SEAL team to \"Deep Core\", a privately owned experimental underwater drilling platform near the Cayman Trough to use as a base of operations. The platform's designer, Dr. Lindsey Brigman, insists on going along with the SEAL team, despite her estranged husband Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman being the current foreman.\n\nDuring initial investigation of the \"Montana\", a power outage in the team's submersibles leads to Lindsey seeing a strange light circling the sub, which she later calls a \"non-terrestrial intelligence\" or \"NTI\". Lt. Coffey, the SEAL team leader, is ordered to accelerate their mission and takes one of the mini-subs without \"Deep Core\"s permission to recover a Trident missile warhead from the \"Montana\" just as the storm hits above. The \"Benthic Explorer\", to which \"Deep Core\" is tethered, is rocked by the storm, and the cable crane is torn from the ship. The crane falls into the trench and, without the mini-sub to disconnect the cable, \"Deep Core\" is dragged toward the trench, stopping just short of it. The rig is partially flooded, killing several crew members and damaging its power systems. Coffey shows little remorse when he and his SEALs return to the damaged base.\n\nThe crew wait out the storm so they can restore communications and be rescued. As they struggle against the cold, they find the NTIs have formed an animated column of water that is exploring the rig. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated by it and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. Realizing that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome, the crew spies on him through a remote operated vehicle, finding him and another SEAL arming the warhead to attack the NTIs. To try and stop him, Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead; Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub, damaging both. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub drifts over the edge, crushing him when it implodes. Bud's mini-sub is inoperable and taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her. Bud swims back to the platform with her body; there, he and the crew administer CPR and revive her, and Bud and Lindsey reaffirm their lost love.\n\nOne SEAL, unaware of Coffey's plan at the time, helps to locate the warhead, stopped on a ledge several thousand feet down the trench. Bud volunteers to use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only be able to communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice to keep him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. The SEAL guides him in successfully disarming it. With little oxygen left in the system, Bud explains he knew it was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud, takes his hand, and guides him to an alien ship deep in the trench. Inside the ship, the NTIs create an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTIs then play back Bud's message to his wife and they look at each other with understanding.\n\nOn \"Deep Core\" the crew is waiting for rescue when they see a message from Bud that he met some friends and warns them to hold on. The base shakes and lights from the trench bring the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with \"Deep Core\" and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull. The crew of \"Deep Core\" exit the platform, surprised they are not suffering from decompression sickness. They see Bud walking out of the alien ship and Lindsey races to hug him.\n\nIn the extended version, the events in the film are played against a backdrop of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the potential for all-out war; the sinking of the \"Montana\" additionally fuels the aggression. There is more conflict between Bud and Lindsey in regards to their former relationship. The primary addition is the ending: when Bud is taken to the alien ship, they start by showing him images of war and aggression from news sources around the globe. The aliens then create massive megatsunamis that threaten the world's coasts, but stop them short before they hit. They then show Bud his message to Lindsey, and let the megatsunamis disperse without damage, as a warning to humanity.\n\n\nH. G. Wells was the first to introduce the notion of a sea alien in his 1897 short story \"In the Abyss\". The idea for \"The Abyss\" came to James Cameron when, at age 17 and in high school, he attended a science lecture about deep sea diving by a man, Francis J. Falejczyk, who was the first human to breathe fluid through his lungs in experiments conducted by Johannes A. Kylstra. He subsequently wrote a short story that focused on a group of scientists in a laboratory at the bottom of the ocean. The basic idea did not change, but many of the details evolved over the years. Once Cameron arrived in Hollywood, he quickly realized that a group of scientists was not that commercial and changed it to a group of blue-collar workers. While making \"Aliens\", Cameron saw a \"National Geographic\" film about remote operated vehicles operating deep in the North Atlantic Ocean. These images reminded him of his short story. He and producer Gale Anne Hurd decided that \"The Abyss\" would be their next film. Cameron wrote a treatment combined with elements of a shooting script, which generated a lot of interest in Hollywood. He then wrote the script, basing the character of Lindsey on Hurd and finished it by the end of 1987. Cameron and Hurd were married before \"The Abyss\", separated during pre-production, and divorced in February 1989, two months after principal photography.\n\nThe cast and crew trained for underwater diving for one week in the Cayman Islands. This was necessary because 40% of all live-action principal photography took place underwater. Furthermore, Cameron's production company had to design and build experimental equipment and develop a state-of-the-art communications system that allowed the director to talk underwater to the actors and dialogue to be recorded directly onto tape for the first time.\n\nCameron had originally planned to shoot on location in the Bahamas where the story was set but quickly realized that he needed to have a completely controlled environment because of the stunts and special visual effects involved. He considered shooting the film in Malta, which had the largest unfiltered tank of water, but it was not adequate for Cameron's needs. Underwater sequences for the film were shot at a unit of the Gaffney Studios, situated south of Cherokee Falls, outside Gaffney, South Carolina, which had been abandoned by Duke Power officials after previously spending $700 million constructing the Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant, along Owensby Street, Gaffney, South Carolina.\n\nTwo specially constructed tanks were used. The first one, based on the abandoned plant's primary reactor containment vessel, held of water, was 55 feet (18 m) deep and 209 feet (70 m) across. At the time, it was the largest fresh-water filtered tank in the world. Additional scenes were shot in the second tank, an unused turbine pit, which held of water. As the production crew rushed to finish painting the main tank, millions of gallons of water poured in and took five days to fill. The Deepcore rig was anchored to a 90-ton concrete column at the bottom of the large tank. It consisted of six partial and complete modules that took over half a year to plan and build from scratch.\n\nCan-Dive Services Ltd., a Canadian commercial diving company that specialized in saturation diving systems and underwater technology, specially manufactured the two working craft (Flatbed and Cab One) for the film. Two million dollars was spent on set construction.\n\nFilming was also done at the largest underground lake in the world—a mine in Bonne Terre, Missouri, which was the background for several underwater shots.\n\nThe main tank was not ready in time for the first day of principal photography. Cameron delayed filming for a week and pushed the smaller tank's schedule forward, demanding that it be ready weeks ahead of schedule. Filming eventually began on August 15, 1988, but there were still problems. On the first day of shooting in the main water tank, it sprang a leak and of water a minute rushed out. The studio brought in dam-repair experts to seal it. In addition, enormous pipes with elbow fittings had been improperly installed. There was so much water pressure in them that the elbows blew off.\n\nCameron's choice of cinematographer on the movie was Mikael Salomon—a US-based Danish national who would go on to work on other blockbusters such as \"Backdraft\" and \"Arachnophobia\" before moving into the director's slot on a myriad of films and TV shows including two editions of the acclaimed HBO WW2 series \"Band of Brothers\". Salomon used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed. Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had to figure out how to keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous tarpaulin. Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.\n\nThe breathing fluid used in the film actually exists but has only been thoroughly investigated in animals. Over the previous 20 years it had been tested on several animals, who survived. The rat shown in the film was actually breathing fluid and survived unharmed.\n\nEd Harris did not actually breathe the fluid. He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) below the surface of the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up. Actors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.\n\nThe cast and crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an isolated set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into spontaneous sobbing while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, \"I knew this was going to be a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just how hard. I don't \"ever\" want to go through this again\". For example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially did not know how to minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely. Actor Leo Burmester said, \"Shooting \"The Abyss\" has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself.\" A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank. Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night. In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.\n\nAs production went on, the slow pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, \"We never started and finished any one scene in any one day\". At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes. While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene—in which she was soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest—the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, \"We are not animals!\" For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks. He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and \"suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there.\" Harris recalled: \"One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out.\" Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, \"For every hour they spent trying to figure out what magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air.\" After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988. Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film. But after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly disowned the film, saying \"I'm never talking about it and never will.\" Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also disowned the film, saying, \"\"The Abyss\" was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them.\"\n\nTo create the alien water tentacle, Cameron initially considered cel animation or a tentacle sculpted in clay and then animated via stop-motion techniques with water reflections projected onto it. Phil Tippett suggested Cameron contact Industrial Light & Magic. The special visual effects work was divided up among seven FX divisions with motion control work by Dream Quest Images and computer graphics and opticals by ILM. ILM designed a program to produce surface waves of differing sizes and kinetic properties for the pseudopod. For the moment where it mimics Bud and Lindsey's faces, Ed Harris had eight of his facial expressions scanned while twelve of Mastrantonio's were scanned via software used to create computer-generated sculptures. The set was photographed from every angle and digitally recreated so that the pseudopod could be accurately composited into the live-action footage. The company spent six months to create 75 seconds of computer graphics needed for the creature. The film was to have opened on July 4, 1989, but its release was delayed for more than a month by production and special effects problems. The animated sequences were supervised by ILM animation director Wes Takahashi.\n\nStudio executives were nervous about the film's commercial prospects when preview audiences laughed at scenes of serious intent. Industry insiders said that the release delay was because nervous executives ordered the film's ending completely re-shot. There was also the question of the size of the film's budget: 20th Century Fox stated that the budget was $43 million, a figure Cameron himself has reiterated. However, estimates put the figure higher with \"The New York Times\" estimating the cost at $45 million and one executive claiming it cost $47 million, while box office revenue tracker website \"The Numbers\" lists the production budget at $70 million.\n\n\"The Abyss\" was released on August 9, 1989, in 1,533 theaters, where it grossed $9.3 million on its opening weekend and ranked #2 at the box office. It went on to make $54.5 million in North America and $35.5 million throughout the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $90 million.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, \"The Abyss\" has an 89% approval rating based on 44 reviews and an average rating of 7.2/10. The critical consensus states: \"The utterly gorgeous special effects frequently overshadow the fact that \"The Abyss\" is also a totally gripping, claustrophobic thriller, complete with an interesting crew of characters.\" On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 14 critics indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The reviews tallied therein are for both the theatrical release and the Special Edition.\n\n\"Newsweek\" magazine's David Ansen, summarizing the theatrical release, wrote, \"The payoff to \"The Abyss\" is pretty damn silly — a portentous \"deus ex machina\" that leaves too many questions unanswered and evokes too many other films.\" In her review for \"The New York Times\", Caryn James claimed that the film had \"at least four endings,\" and \"by the time the last ending of this two-and-a-quarter-hour film comes along, the effect is like getting off a demon roller coaster that has kept racing several laps after you were ready to get off.\" Chris Dafoe, in his review for \"The Globe and Mail\", wrote, \"At its best, \"The Abyss\" offers a harrowing, thrilling journey through inky waters and high tension. In the end, however, this torpedo turns out to be a dud—it swerves at the last minute, missing its target and exploding ineffectually in a flash of fantasy and fairy-tale schtick.\"\n\nWhile praising the film's first two hours as \"compelling\", the \"Toronto Star\" remarked, \"But when Cameron takes the adventure to the next step, deep into the heart of fantasy, it all becomes one great big deja boo. If we are to believe what Cameron finds way down there, E.T. didn't really phone home, he went surfing and fell off his board.\" \"USA Today\" gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"Most of this underwater blockbuster is 'good,' and at least two action set pieces are great. But the dopey wrap-up sinks the rest 20,000 leagues.\" In her review for \"The Washington Post\", Rita Kempley wrote that the film \"asks us to believe that the drowned return to life, that the comatose come to the rescue, that driven women become doting wives, that Neptune cares about landlubbers. I'd sooner believe that Moby Dick could swim up the drainpipe.\" \"Halliwell's Film Guide\" claimed the film was \"despite some clever special effects, a tedious, overlong fantasy that is more excited by machinery than people.\" Conversely, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's Peter Travers enthused, \"[\"The Abyss\" is] the greatest underwater adventure ever filmed, the most consistently enthralling of the summer blockbusters…one of the best pictures of the year.\"\n\nThe release of the Special Edition in 1993 garnered much praise. Each giving it thumbs up, Siskel remarked, \"\"The Abyss\" has been improved,\" and Ebert added, \"It makes the film seem more well rounded.\" In the book \"Reel Views 2\", James Berardinelli comments, \"James Cameron's \"The Abyss\" may be the most extreme example of an available movie that demonstrates how the vision of a director, once fully realized on screen, can transform a good motion picture into a great one.\"\n\n\"The Abyss\" won the 1990 Oscar for Best Visual Effects (John Bruno, Dennis Muren, Hoyt Yeatman, and Dennis Skotak). It was also nominated for:\n\nThe studio unsuccessfully lobbied hard to get Michael Biehn nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nMany other film organizations, such as the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, and the American Society of Cinematographers, also nominated \"The Abyss\". The film ended up winning a total of three other awards from these organizations.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"The Abyss\" was released on August 22, 1989.\n\nVarèse Sarabande, which released the original album, issued a limited-edition (3,000 copies), two-disc album in 2014 featuring the complete score minus the end credits medley, which is absent from both releases.\n\n\"Disc One\":\n\n\"Disc Two\": Tracks 10-19 are bonus tracks.\n\nEven as the film was in the first weeks of its 1989 theatrical release, rumors were circulating of a wave sequence missing from the film's end. As chronicled in the 1993 LaserDisc Special Edition release and later in the 2000 DVD, the pressure to cut the film's running time stemmed from both distribution concerns and Industrial Light & Magic's then-inability to complete the required sequences. From the distributor's perspective, the looming three-hour length limited the number of times the film could be shown each day, assuming that audiences would be willing to sit through the entire film, though 1990's \"Dances with Wolves\" would shatter both industry-held notions. Further, test audience screenings revealed a surprisingly mixed reaction to the sequences as they appeared in their unfinished form; in post-screening surveys, they dominated both the \"Scenes I liked most\" and \"Scenes I liked least\" fields. Contrary to speculation, studio meddling was not the cause of the shortened length; Cameron held final cut as long as the film met a running time of roughly two hours and 15 minutes. He later noted, \"Ironically, the studio brass were horrified when I said I was cutting the wave.\"\n\nWhat emerges in the winnowing process is only the best stuff. And I think the overall caliber of the film is improved by that. I cut only two minutes of \"Terminator\". On \"Aliens\", we took out much more. I even reconstituted some of that in a special (TV) release version.\n\nThe sense of something being missing on \"Aliens\" was greater for me than on \"The Abyss\", where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.\nCameron elected to remove the sequences along with other, shorter scenes elsewhere in the film, reducing the running time from roughly two hours and 50 minutes to two hours and 20 minutes and diminishing his signature themes of nuclear peril and disarmament. Subsequent test audience screenings drew substantially better reactions.\n\nStar Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio publicly expressed regret about some of the scenes selected for removal from the film's theatrical cut: \"There were some beautiful scenes that were taken out. I just wish we hadn't shot so much that isn't in the film.\"\n\nShortly after the film's premiere, Cameron and video editor Ed Marsh created a longer video cut of \"The Abyss\" for their own use that incorporated dailies. With the tremendous success of Cameron's \"\" in 1991, Lightstorm Entertainment secured a five-year, $500 million financing deal with 20th Century Fox for films produced, directed or written by Cameron. The contract allocated roughly $500,000 of the amount to complete \"The Abyss\". ILM was commissioned to finish the work they had started three years earlier, with many of the same people who had worked on it originally.\n\nThe CGI tools developed for \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" allowed ILM to complete the rumored tidal wave sequence, as well as correcting flaws in rendering for all their other work done for the film.\n\nThe tidal wave sequence had originally been designed by ILM as a physical effect, using a plastic wave, but Cameron was dissatisfied with the end result, and the sequence was scrapped. By the time Cameron was ready to revisit \"The Abyss\", ILM's CGI prowess had finally progressed to an appropriate level, and the wave was rendered as a CGI effect. \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" screenwriter and frequent Cameron collaborator William Wisher had a cameo in the scene as a reporter in Santa Monica who catches the first tidal wave on camera.\n\nWhen it was discovered that original production sound recordings had been lost, new dialogue and foley were recorded, but since Kidd Brewer had died of a self-inflicted gunshot before he could return to re-loop his dialog, producers and editors had to lift his original dialogue tracks from the remaining optical-sound prints of the dailies. The Special Edition was therefore dedicated to his memory as a result.\n\nAs Alan Silvestri was not available to compose new music for the restored scenes, Robert Garrett, who had composed temporary music for the film's initial cutting in 1989, was chosen to create new music. The Special Edition was completed in December 1992, with 28 minutes added to the film, and saw a limited theatrical release in New York City and Los Angeles on February 26, 1993 (the 1993 World Trade Center bombing occurred on that day), and expanded to key cities nationwide in the following weeks.\n\nThe first THX-certified LaserDisc title of the Special Edition Box Set was released in May 1993 and was a best-seller for the rest of the year. The Special Edition was released on VHS in 1996 as a part of Fox Video's Widescreen Series with a seven minute behind-the-scenes featurette with footage that did not appear in the \"Under Pressure: The Making of The Abyss\" documentary that was included on the Laserdisc and DVD releases. The Special Edition's first DVD release in 2000 was on two discs and featured animated menus, both the theatrical and Special Edition versions of the film along with the Laserdisc's extensive text, artwork and photographic documentation of the film's production, a ten minute featurette and the sixty minute documentary \"Under Pressure: The Making of The Abyss.\" All available DVDs are non-anamorphic with the exception of the Chinese DVD produced for Region 6 by Excel Media.\n\nIn 2014 the pay cable channels Cinemax and HBO began broadcasting both versions of the film in 1080p. Both broadcasts began circulating amongst online piracy communities shortly thereafter. Netflix's UK service began offering the theatrical version in 1080p in 2017. At an October, 2014 event James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd were asked about a future blu-ray release for the film. Cameron gestured to the head of Fox Home Entertainment, implying the decision lay with the studio. Five months later another article suggested a spat between Cameron and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment was responsible for the delay. While promoting the upcoming 30th-anniversary Blu-ray release of Aliens at Comic-Con in San Diego July 2016 James Cameron confirmed that he was working on a remastered 4K transfer of \"The Abyss\" and that it would be released on Blu-ray for the first time in early 2017. Cameron added, \"We've done a wet-gate 4K scan of the original negative, and it's going to look insanely good. We're going to do an authoring pass in the DI for Blu-ray and HDR at the same time.\" It is unclear if this new scan is the one used to create the 1080p broadcasts.\n\nIt is unknown whether both the theatrical and special-edition versions will be included. As of 2018, the Blu-ray is yet to be released.\n\nScience-fiction author Orson Scott Card was hired to write a novelization of the film based on the screenplay and discussions with Cameron. He wrote back-stories for Bud, Lindsey, and Coffey as a means not only of helping the actors define their roles, but also to justify some of their behavior and mannerisms in the film. Card also wrote the aliens as a colonizing species which preferentially sought high-pressure deep-water worlds to build their ships as they traveled further into the galaxy (their mothership was in orbit on the far side of the moon). The NTIs' knowledge of neuroanatomy and nanoscale manipulation of biochemistry was responsible for many of the \"deus ex machina\" aspects of the film.\n\nA licensed interactive fiction video game based on the script was being developed for Infocom by Bob Bates, but was cancelled when Infocom was shut down by its then-parent company Activision. Sound Source Interactive later created an action video game entitled \"The Abyss: Incident at Europa\". The game takes place a few years after the film, where the player must find a cure for a deadly virus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "187861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187861", "title": "V.", "text": "V.\n\nV. is the debut novel of Thomas Pynchon, published in 1963. It describes the exploits of a discharged U.S. Navy sailor named Benny Profane, his reconnection in New York with a group of pseudo-bohemian artists and hangers-on known as the Whole Sick Crew, and the quest of an aging traveler named Herbert Stencil to identify and locate the mysterious entity he knows only as \"V.\" It was nominated for a National Book Award.\n\nThe novel alternates between episodes featuring Benny, Stencil and other members of the Whole Sick Crew (including Profane's sidekick Pig Bodine) in 1956 (with a few minor flashbacks), and a generation-spanning plot that comprises Stencil's attempts to unravel the clues he believes will lead him to \"V.\" (or to the various incarnations thereof). Each of these \"Stencilised\" chapters is set at a different moment of historical crisis; the framing narrative involving Stencil, \"V.\", and the journals of Stencil's British spy/diplomat father threads the sequences together. The novel's two storylines increasingly converge in the last chapters (the intersecting lines forming a V-shape, as it were), as Stencil hires Benny to travel with him to Malta.\n\nThe opening chapter is set in Norfolk, Virginia Christmas Eve, 1955. Benny Profane, a recently discharged seaman, is at a local sailor bar called the \"Sailor's Grave\" in which every waitress is named Beatrice and the beer taps are rubber model breasts that the sailors suck on. Here Profane meets Ploy, a short violent sailor, his musician friend Dewey Gland, and the Maltese barmaid Paola Hod. Bar owner Mrs. Buffo begins to play a rendition of It Came Upon the Midnight Clear to celebrate Christmas only to be immediately assaulted by Ploy and the rest of the intoxicated sailors. The disorder triggers a raid by the military police. Pig Bodine, Paola, Dewey Gland and Profane escape the chaos to Pig's apartment.\n\nThe chapter opens with Rachel Owlglass confronting the plastic surgeon Shale Schoenmaker who she accuses of manipulating her friend and roommate Esther Havitz into debt through repeated rhinoplasty. Schoenmaker responds by entering into a monologue on the nature of Jewish women and the nature of appearance.\n\nSection II is set during a party at Rachel's apartment attended by the \"Sick Crew\", Paola, Esther, and Debb. This section introduces the character Herbert Stencil, a troubled man who is obsessed with his father's mysterious death in Malta and the identity of \"V\", a woman mentioned in his father's journal.\n\nThis chapter, set among the British community in Egypt toward the end of the 19th century, consists of an introduction and a series of eight relatively short sections, each of them from the point of view of a different person. The eight sections come together to tell a story of murder and intrigue, intersecting the life of a young woman, Victoria Wren, the first incarnation of V. The title is a hint as to how this chapter is to be understood: Stencil imagines each of the eight viewpoints as he reconstructs—we do not know on how much knowledge and how much conjecture—this episode. This chapter is a reworking of Pynchon's short story \"Under the Rose\", which was first published in 1961 and is collected in \"Slow Learner\" (1984). In the \"Slow Learner\" introduction, Pynchon admits he took the details of the setting (\"right down to the names of the diplomatic corps\") from Karl Baedeker's 1899 travel guide for Egypt. Stencil's reconstruction follows the same basic conflict as \"Under the Rose\", but it gives the non-European characters much more personality.\n\nSection I details the history of Shale Schoenmaker, M.D. and how he began his career as a plastic surgeon. During World War One he eagerly enlists in the A.E.F. hoping to become a pilot but, is instead given a position as an engineer. While serving he witnesses Evan Godolphin, a handsome pilot whom he idealized, become horribly disfigured during an air raid. A month later Schoenmaker visits Godolphin in the hospital while he is recovering from reconstructive surgery, discovering that an incompetent surgeon, Halidom, treated him using the archaic method that would inevitably lead to further disfigurement by infection. This event traumatizes Schoenmaker, causing him to now see it as his mission to help people like Godolphin, a conviction that slowly decays over time.\n\nOnly marginally part of the Stencil/V. material, this chapter follows Benny and others, as Benny has a job hunting alligators in the sewers under Manhattan. It figures in the Stencil/V. story in that there is a rat named \"Veronica\" who figures in a subplot about a mad priest — Father Linus Fairing, S.J. — some decades back, living in the sewers and preaching to the rats; we hear from him in the form of his diary. Stencil himself makes a brief appearance toward the end of the chapter.\n\nThe chapter follows Profane, Geronimo, Angel, and his sister Josephine \"Fina\" into the city over several nights of drinking. Fina and Profane's relationship develops amid concerns over her status within a local mercenary street gang known as the Playboys, who see her as a spiritual figurehead. The chapter ends amid a massive brawl, nearby which Fina is found lying naked and smiling.\n\nIn Florence in 1899, Victoria appears again, briefly, but so does the place name \"Vheissu\", which may or may not stand for Vesuvius, Venezuela, a crude interpretation of \"wie heißt du\", translating into \"who are you\" in the German language, or even (one character jokes) Venus. The chapter also revolves around an attempted burglary of Botticelli's \"The Birth of Venus\" by Hugh Godolphin through the Venezuelan consulate.\n\nThe chapter begins with Benny Profane, freshly unemployed after being laid-off from sewer-alligator hunting, in search of a job in Manhattan. After briefly contemplating the nature of money on a park bench, he, by chance, looks at an advertisement issued by The Time/Space Employment Agency. Once arriving at the agency he finds, much to his annoyance, that the secretary is his former lover Rachel Owlglass. In section IV Stencil continues his investigation of the perplexing \"V.\" (whom he now believes is either Victoria or the rat Veronica) meeting up with a Yoyodyne engineer Kurt Mondaugen.\n\nKurt Mondaugen, who will appear again in \"Gravity's Rainbow\", is the central character in a story set in South-West Africa (now Namibia) partly during a siege in 1922 at which one Vera Meroving is present, but most notably in 1904, during the Herero Wars, when South-West Africa was a German colony.\n\nMcClintic Sphere, an alto sax player in a jazz band, returns home to his boarding house in Harlem. The previous week, spent playing primarily for condescending, snobby Ivy League students, has left him exhausted, and he relaxes in his room with a prostitute named Ruby. Benny, meanwhile, finally gets a job at Anthroresearch Associates, where he's introduced to SHROUD, a synthetic humanoid with whom he holds imaginary conversations. Pig Bodine and Roony Winsome get into a fight, based on Roony's suspicion that Pig is involved with his (Roony's) wife, Mafia. Meanwhile, Mafia aggressively pursues sex with Benny, who declines. Schoenmaker and Esther get into a few arguments because he says he wants to bring out her inner beauty by performing more plastic surgery on her. The chapter finishes out with the Whole Sick Crew hanging out in various places: Sheridan Square, the Rusty Spoon, Slab in front of his Cheese Danish No. 35 canvas. Stencil, looking for Rachel at her apartment, comes upon Paola who gives him the Confessions of Fausto Maijstral.\n\nFausto Maijstral, Maltese civilian suffering under the German bombardment and working to clear the rubble during World War II writes a long letter to his daughter Paola, who figures in the Benny Profane story; the letter comes into Stencil's hands. The letter includes copious quotations from Fausto's diary. Besides the place name Valletta, V. figures in the story as an old — or possibly not-so-old — woman crushed by a beam of a fallen building.\n\nRoony and Mafia continue fighting, so Roony meets up with McClintic at the V-Note, and they travel to Lenox, Massachusetts. Returning to Matilda's boardinghouse, they meet up with Ruby, who Roony recognizes as being a member of the Crew in disguise. Esther tells Slab she is pregnant. He wants to send her to Cuba to get an abortion, and raises the money by announcing his intentions and asking for money at a party the Crew is throwing in an abandoned warehouse. Roony's attempts to deal with his wife then take a dark turn, but he is saved by Pig. At an airport, Esther and Slab attempt to catch Esther a flight to Cuba, but meet some resistance. Paola, traveling with McClintic, reveals her true identity to him. He delivers the line, \"Keep cool, but care,\" considered the novel's central theme, as they drive off into the Berkshires.\n\nBenny loses his job at Anthroresearch Associates by sleeping in and not being at work to notify the attendant technician that several calamities have occurred in the lab. Rachel nudges him to get a new job, and says that she will find one for him herself. An amusing story unfolds about Benny and Pig during their \"Scaffold\" days. Benny, unable and unwilling to get work, instead takes a self-described vacation and chooses to spend his spare time at the Rusty Spoon. He gets drunk with Stencil, who relates the entirety his knowledge of V. as it stands to this point in the novel. Valletta being the last place on Stencil's journey to find information about V., he asks Benny to accompany him and Paola to the island. Benny and Stencil commit a robbery in perilous circumstances, and then, in late September, they embark for Malta with Paola on board the \"Susanna Squaducci\".\n\nIn this chapter V. is entranced by a young ballerina, Mélanie l'Heuremaudit. The story centers on a riotous ballet performance, almost certainly modeled in part on the premiere of Igor Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\". The performance centers on a virgin sacrifice by impalement. The young ballerina fails to wear her protective equipment and actually dies by impalement in the course of the performance; everyone assumes her death throes simply to be an uncharacteristically emotional performance.\n\nBenny and Pig Bodine have one last adventure with two girls, Flip and Flop, as they all get drunk and wander around Washington D.C.. There are two going away parties for Benny, and the chapter ends with Benny, Stencil, and Paola leaving for Malta aboard the \"Susanna Squaducci\" as the Crew looks on and says goodbye.\n\nAs the Royal Navy mass on Malta in the early stages of the Suez Crisis, Stencil arrives with Benny in tow, searching for Fausto Maijstral. (As always, Kilroy was here first, and Pynchon proposes a novel origin for the face: that Kilroy was originally a schematic for part of a band-pass filter.)\n\nThe last chapter is a flashback to Valletta when Stencil, Sr. was still alive. After World War I he is sent to Malta to observe the various crises going on involving the natives and their desire for independence. He is implored by Maijstral's wife (who is pregnant with Fausto) to relieve him of his duties as a double agent because she fears for his life. Stencil, Sr. meets Veronica Manganese or V and implicitly has sex with her (she is now largely made up of artificial limbs). It is revealed they had trysted in Florence after the riots. He finds out that Maijstral is having an affair with her as well.\n\nLinus Fairing is also working as a double agent for Stencil, and when he leaves for America, having tired of the life of a spy, Stencil's purpose for being in Malta is null.\n\nV releases Stencil from her auspices and Maijstral as well.\n\nStencil sails off into the Mediterranean and a waterspout blows the ship up into the air, then down into the depths, not too dissimilar from the conclusion of another American masterpiece, Moby-Dick, also a sailor's story.\n\n\n\n\"Time\" wrote \"In this sort of book, there is no total to arrive at. Nothing makes any waking sense. But it makes a powerful, deeply disturbing dream sense. Nothing in the book seems to have been thrown in arbitrarily, merely to confuse, as is the case when inept authors work at illusion. Pynchon appears to be indulging in the fine, pre-Freudian luxury of dreams dreamt for the dreaming. The book sails with majesty through caverns measureless to man. What does it mean? Who, finally, is V.? Few books haunt the waking or the sleeping mind, but this is one. Who, indeed?\"\n\nTony Tanner considered the novel an exploration of the plots individuals ascribe onto the ambivalent universe they have no choice but to confront, during a 20th century period in which genuine communication between individuals has been eroded and in which ambiguous societal forces are at work (intentionally or inadvertently) towards a state of entropy; \"SHROUD asks, \"\"Has it occurred to you there may be no more standards for crazy or sane, now that it's started?\" And Benny answers, \"What, for Christ's sake?\"\" What the 'it' is that has started (if there is an 'it'), what common process links remote imperialist incidents with contemporary automation, tourism, Hitler, and the Whole Sick Crew (if there is any linking common process) - this is what the whole book is about.\"\n\nWriting in \"The New York Times\", George Plimpton called Pynchon \"a young writer of staggering promise\", lauding his \"vigorous and imaginative style\", \"robust humor\" and \"tremendous reservoir of information\".\n\nIn 1964, the novel was awarded a William Faulkner Foundation Award for best debut novel.\n\nIn 2012 it emerged that there were multiple versions of \"V.\" in circulation. This was due to the fact that Pynchon's final modifications were made after the first edition was printed and thus were only implemented in the British, or Jonathan Cape, edition and the Bantam paperback. The fact was forgotten soon after in the U.S., so most US editions, including the newly released eBook, follow the first printing and are therefore unauthorized versions of the text, while the British editions, which follow the first edition printed by Jonathan Cape, contain Pynchon's final revisions.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6004711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6004711", "title": "Window Seat (song)", "text": "Window Seat (song)\n\n\"Window Seat\" is a song by Erykah Badu. It is the lead single from her album \"New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh)\" (2010). It was produced by Badu and James Poyser. The song is low-tempo ballad with lyrics that concern escapism and longing for a lover. The music video for \"Window Seat\" features Badu walking the streets around Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, slowly stripping to the nude, before being shot by an unseen assassin. Badu's public nudity, guerrilla filming, and the video's allusions to the assassination of John F. Kennedy were met with controversy among fans and critics.\n\n\"Jump up in the Air (Stay There)\", featuring Lil Wayne and Bilal, was released as an internet-only promotional single on Badu's official website in January 2010. RC Williams, Badu's musical director, said that a music video for the track was shot in Dallas. A censored \"clean\" version of the video was released on February 12, 2010 on Badu's official website. It has been made available as a free, legal download by Giant Step, the marketing and promotion company for the album.\n\"Window Seat\" was released as the album's official lead single, Badu released a downloadable link to the song on her Twitter account. \"Window Seat\" was released to the iTunes Store on February 9, 2010. In its promotion, Delta Air Lines has signed on to use the song as boarding music for its flights.\n\nThe song debuted at number 95 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. It also entered at number 47 on \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, ultimately peaking at number 16 in its five weeks on the chart.\n\n\"Window Seat\" received generally positive reviews from most music critics. PopMatters writer Quentin B. Huff found Badu's vulnerability on the song comparable to her work on \"Mama's Gun\" (2000). Allmusic's Andy Kellman wrote that it \"should appeal to those who have wanted Badu to revisit that lissome sound of \"Baduizm\" songs like 'On & On' and 'Otherside of the Game,' and it packs stunning stomp-and-clap breakdowns that sync up with Badu's most halting lines\". Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes called it \"as amniotic a slow jam as Badu has ever recorded\". BBC Online writer Stevie Chick praised Badu's performance on the song, writing that she sings \"with such earnest, desperate yearning you’ll be struck dumb\". \"The Washington Post\"s Chris Richards described the song as \"vintage Badu: gentle melodies, a twinkling harp, rim-shots click-clacking at an easy, Sunday morning tempo\". \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Margaret Wappler praised co-producer and keyboardist James Poyser's contribution, writing that he \"elevates\" the song \"into a juicy slice of escapism but with the security of someone missing you back home\". \"The Village Voice\"s Pazz & Jop annual year-end critics' poll ranked \"Window Seat\" at number 11 to find the best music of 2010, tied with Arcade Fires \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\" and LCD Soundsystems \"I Can Change\".\n\nOn March 13, 2010, Badu filmed an impromptu music video for \"Window Seat\" in the Dealey Plaza historic district of Dallas, Texas. In the video, Badu is seen walking the streets of Dealey Plaza in Dallas, slowly stripping to the nude, before being shot by an unseen assassin. On her Twitter feed, she stated that the music video \"was shot guerrilla style, no crew, 1 take, no closed set, no warning, 2 min., Downtown Dallas, then ran like hell\". Badu was inspired by indie rock duo Matt & Kim's video for the song \"Lessons Learned\", viewing it as \"the bravest, most liberating thing I’ve ever seen two people do... I wanted to dedicate this contagious act of liberation and freedom to them. I hoped it would become something contagious that people would want to do in some way or another\". Badu has expressed that her video is a criticism of the psychological concept groupthink. On the video's location, Badu expressed that Matt & Kim's video and its \"monumental\" Times Square setting influenced her to film in Dealey Plaza, which is known as the site of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. She viewed the historic district's grassy knoll as a monumental place in Dallas and that she \"tied it in a way that compared that assassination to the character assassination one would go through after showing his or her self completely. That’s exactly the action that I wanted to display\". After she collapses to the ground in the video, blue blood spills out to form the word \"groupthink\", after which Badu's voiceover says:\n\nBadu intended for the assassination scene to represent character assassination by groupthink. Prior to the filming of the official music video, a video teaser of \"Window Seat\" was featured on Badu's official website around early March, which begins with a shot of Badu's boarding pass of the flight she had booked on the fictional Amerykah Airlines, and mainly features her putting on make-up at a make-up table. A second version of the video, entitled \"Window Seat (Reexamined)\", was posted on her website and features the original video in reverse; the ending monologue with Badu's voiceover was repositioned to the start of the footage. A music video for the song's official remix, featuring rapper Rick Ross, was shot during May 2010.\n\n\"Window Seat\"'s official music video was premiered on March 27, 2010 at 3:33 a.m. on Badu's website. Circulating throughout several Internet blogs, the music video was received with controversy and a divided reaction from fans, Internet critics, and media outlets. On March 30, 2010, it became the ninth most popular search on Google. The music video also prompted attention from Dallas city officials for Badu's public nudity and filming without city permits. Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway expressed concern for stricter laws to prevent similar incidents, stating \"None of this would have occurred had she stayed clothed. But since she didn't, it elevated the need for making sure that we have policies in place that will protect folks and the integrity of the city as best we possibly can ... What if there is another take to her bizarre activity? What if there is a part two and we don't take some type of action or put it up for discussion and she comes out and really gets with it and does a Michael Jackson-type video and have 15, 20 people and all of them take their clothes off?\"\n\nOn April 2, 2010, Badu was charged with disorderly conduct for her public nudity, a class C misdemeanor indicating a $500 fine, when a witness came forward. According to Dallas Deputy Police Chief Mike Genovesi, the witness \"had two small children with her and was offended\". In an interview for the \"Dallas Morning News\", Badu said that her part in the video foreshadowed the controversy and reaction to the video, stating \"I knew that would happen, so as soon as the thought came to my mind, I decided to assassinate myself as a gesture. Because it was going to happen anyway. The video is a prediction of what is happening now\". In an April 3, 2010 interview on \"The Wanda Sykes Show\", she explained in response to critics of the video that she did not intend to disrespect the memory of John F. Kennedy with its allusion to his assassination, stating \"My point was grossly misunderstood all over America. JFK is one of my heroes, one of the nation's heroes. John F. Kennedy was a revolutionary; he was not afraid to butt heads with America, and I was not afraid to show America my butt-naked truth.\" On April 28, 2010, Badu challenged the disorderly conduct charge by pleading not guilty rather than paying the fee by mail. On August 13, she paid the $500 fine and agreed to serve six months probation through February 11, 2011.\n\n"}
