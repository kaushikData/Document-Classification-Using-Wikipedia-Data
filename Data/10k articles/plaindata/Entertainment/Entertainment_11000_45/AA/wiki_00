Northup was put to work on plantations in the state of Louisiana for 12 years before being released. The first scholarly edition of Northup's memoir, co-edited in 1968 by Sue Eakin and Joseph Logsdon, carefully retraced and validated the account and concluded it to be accurate. Other characters in the film were also real people, including Edwin and Mary Epps, and Patsey.\n\nThe film was directed by Steve McQueen. The screenplay was written by John Ridley. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Solomon Northup. Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Brad Pitt, and Alfre Woodard are all featured in supporting roles. Principal photography took place in New Orleans, Louisiana, from June 27 to August 13, 2012. The locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: Felicity, Bocage, Destrehan, and Magnolia. Of the four, Magnolia is nearest to the actual plantation where Northup was held.\n\n\"12 Years a Slave\" was named the best film of 2013 by several media outlets. The film holds a rating of 96% on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\". It earned over $187 million on a production budget of $22 million. The film won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress for Nyong'o, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Ridley. The Best Picture win made McQueen the first black British producer to ever receive the award and the first black British director of a Best Picture winner. The film was awarded the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama, and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts recognized it with the Best Film and the Best Actor award for Ejiofor. \"12 Years a Slave\" was later named the 44th greatest film since 2000 in a BBC poll of 177 critics.\n\nIn 1841, Solomon Northup is a free African-American man working as a violinist, living with his wife and two children in Saratoga Springs, New York. Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive they drug Northup and deliver him to a slave pen run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather belt. Northup is later shipped to New Orleans along with other captive African Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the South, he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man. A slave trader named Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \"Platt\", a runaway slave from Georgia, and sells him to plantation owner William Ford. Ford takes a liking to Northup and gives him a violin. However, tension grows between Northup and plantation overseer John Tibeats which ends with Northup savagely beating and whipping Tibeats. Tibeats and his group try to hang Northup. Although they are not successful, Northup is left on the noose for hours before he is finally cut down. To save Northup's life, Ford sells him to another slave owner named Edwin Epps. In the process, Northup attempts to explain that he is actually a free man, but Ford tells him he is too afraid and that he cannot help him now.\n\nEdwin Epps, unlike Ford, is ruthless and unforgiving. Northup meets Patsey, a favored slave who can pick over 500 pounds of cotton a day, twice the usual quota, whom Epps regularly rapes and abuses. Sometime later, cotton worms destroy Epps's cotton. Unable to work his fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he uses the money to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail a letter to his friends in New York. Armsby agrees and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In the middle of the night, a drunken Epps wakes Northup and questions him menacingly about the letter. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents. Northup in a rage destroys his violin.\n\nNorthup begins working on the construction of a gazebo with a Canadian laborer named Samuel Bass. Bass is unsettled by the brutal way that Epps treats his slaves and expresses his opposition to American slavery, earning Epps's enmity. Northup overhears the conversation and decides to reveal his kidnapping to Bass. Once again, Northup asks for help in getting a letter to Saratoga Springs. Although Bass is hesitant at first because of the risks, he agrees to send it. One day, the local sheriff arrives in a carriage with another man. The sheriff asks Northup a series of questions to confirm that his answers match the facts of his life in New York. Northup recognizes the sheriff's companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in Saratoga. Parker has come to free him, and the two embrace, though an enraged Epps furiously protests the circumstances and tries to prevent Northup from leaving. Northup gives an emotional farewell to Patsey and rides off to his freedom.\n\nAfter being enslaved for 12 years, Northup is restored to freedom and returned to his family, leaving behind the other slaves. As he walks into his home, he sees his wife with their son and daughter (fully grown) and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. Northup apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics recounting Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton, and Burch, along with the 1853 publication of Northup's slave narrative memoir, \"Twelve Years a Slave\". The memoir describes his role in the abolitionist movement and the mystery surrounding details of his death and burial. Patsey and Northup never met again.\n\n\n\nQuvenzhané Wallis and Dwight Henry have small roles as Margaret Northup and Uncle Abram, respectively.\n\nAfter meeting screenwriter John Ridley at a Creative Artists Agency screening of \"Hunger\" in 2008, director Steve McQueen got in touch with Ridley about his interest in making a film about \"the slave era in America\" with \"a character that was not obvious in terms of their trade in slavery.\" Developing the idea back and forth, the two did not strike a chord until McQueen's partner, Bianca Stigter, found Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir \"Twelve Years a Slave\". McQueen later told an interviewer:\n\nI read this book, and I was totally stunned. At the same time, I was pretty upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a national hero, and for me, this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before – a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.\n\nAfter a lengthy development process, during which Brad Pitt's production company Plan B Entertainment backed the project, which eventually helped get some financing from various film studios, the film was officially announced in August 2011 with McQueen to direct and Chiwetel Ejiofor to star as Solomon Northup, a free African-American who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South. McQueen compared Ejiofor's conduct \"of class and dignity\" to that of Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte. In October 2011, Michael Fassbender (who starred in McQueen's previous films \"Hunger\" and \"Shame\") joined the cast. In early 2012, the rest of the roles were cast, and filming was scheduled to begin at the end of June 2012.\n\nTo capture the language and dialects of the era and regions in which the film takes place, dialect coach Michael Buster assisted the cast in altering their speech. The language has a literary quality related to the style of writing of the day and the strong influence of the King James Bible. Buster explained:\nWe don't know what slaves sounded like in the 1840s, so I just used rural samples from Mississippi and Louisiana [for actors Ejiofor and Fassbender]. Then for Benedict [Cumberbatch], I found some real upper-class New Orleanians from the '30s. And then I also worked with Lupita Nyong'o, who is Kenyan but she did her training at Yale. So she really shifted her speech so she could do American speech.\n\nAfter both won Oscars at the 86th Academy Awards, it was reported that McQueen and Ridley had been in an ongoing feud over screenplay credit. McQueen reportedly had asked Ridley for shared credit, which he declined. McQueen appealed to Fox Searchlight, which sided with Ridley. Neither thanked the other during their respective acceptance speeches at the event. Since the event, Ridley has noted his regret for not mentioning McQueen and denied the feud. He spoke favorably of working with McQueen, and explained that his sole screenplay credit was due to the rules of the Writers Guild of America. McQueen has not commented on the alleged feud.\n\nWith a production budget of , principal photography began in New Orleans, Louisiana, on , 2012. After seven weeks, filming concluded on , 2012. As a way to keep down production costs, a bulk of the filming took place around the greater New Orleans area – mostly south of the Red River country in the north of the state, where the historic Northup was enslaved. Among locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: Felicity, Bocage, Destrehan, and Magnolia. Magnolia, a plantation in Schriever, Louisiana, is just a few miles from one of the historic sites where Northup was held. \"To know that we were right there in the place where these things occurred was so powerful and emotional,\" said actor Chiwetel Ejiofor. \"That feeling of dancing with ghosts – it's palpable.\" Filming also took place at the Columns Hotel and Madame John's Legacy in the French Quarter of New Orleans.\n\nCinematographer Sean Bobbitt, the film's primary camera operator, shot \"12 Years a Slave\" on 35 mm film with a 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio using both an Arricam LT and ST. \"Particularly for a period piece, film gives the audience a definite sense of period and quality,\" said Bobbitt. \"And because of the story's epic nature, widescreen clearly made the most sense. Widescreen means a big film, an epic tale – in this case an epic tale of human endurance.\"\n\nThe filmmakers avoided the desaturated visual style that is typical of a more gritty documentary aesthetic. Deliberately drawing visual comparisons in the filming to the works of Spanish painter Francisco Goya, McQueen explained:\nWhen you think about Goya, who painted the most horrendous pictures of violence and torture and so forth, and they're amazing, exquisite paintings, one of the reasons they're such wonderful paintings is because what he's saying is, 'Look – look at this.' So if you paint it badly or put it in the sort of wrong perspective, you draw more attention to what's wrong with the image rather than looking at the image.\n\nTo accurately depict the time period of the film, the filmmakers conducted extensive research that included studying artwork from the era. With eight weeks to create the wardrobe, costume designer Patricia Norris collaborated with Western Costume to compile costumes that would illustrate the passage of time while also being historically accurate. Using an earth tone color palette, Norris created nearly 1,000 costumes for the film. \"She [Norris] took earth samples from all three of the plantations to match the clothes,\" McQueen said, \"and she had the conversation with Sean [Bobbitt] to deal with the character temperature on each plantation, there was a lot of that minute detail.\" The filmmakers also used some pieces of clothing discovered on set that were worn by slaves.\n\nThe musical score to \"12 Years a Slave\" was composed by Hans Zimmer, with original on-screen violin music written and arranged by Nicholas Britell and performed by Tim Fain. The film also features a few pieces of western classical and American folk music such as Franz Schubert's \"Trio in B-flat, D471\" and John and Alan Lomax's arrangement of \"Run, Nigger, Run\". A soundtrack album, \"Music from and Inspired by 12 Years a Slave\", was released digitally on November 5 and received a physical format release on November 11, 2013, by Columbia Records. In addition to Zimmer's score, the album features music inspired by the film by artists such as John Legend, Laura Mvula, Alicia Keys, Chris Cornell, and Alabama Shakes. Legend's cover of \"Roll, Jordan, Roll\" debuted online three weeks prior to the soundtrack's release.\n\nAfrican-American history and culture scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was a consultant on the film, and researcher David Fiske, co-author of \"Solomon Northup: The Complete Story of the Author of Twelve Years a Slave,\" provided some material used to market the film. Nevertheless, news and magazine articles around the time of the film's release described a scholar alleging some license that Northup could have taken with his book, and liberties that McQueen definitely took with Northup's original, for dramatic, modernizing, or other reasons.\n\nScott Feinberg wrote in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" about a September 22 article in \"The New York Times\" that \"dredged up and highlighted a 1985 essay by another scholar, James Olney, that questioned the 'literal truth' of specific incidents in Northup's account and suggested that David Wilson, the white amanuensis to whom Northup had dictated his story, had taken the liberty of sprucing it up to make it even more effective at rallying public opinion against slavery.\" According to Olney, when abolitionists invited an ex-slave to share his experience in slavery at an antislavery convention, and when they subsequently funded the appearance of that story in print, \"they had certain clear expectations, well understood by themselves and well understood by the ex-slave, too.\"\n\nNoah Berlatsky wrote in \"The Atlantic\" about a scene in McQueen's adaptation. Shortly after Northup's kidnapping, he is sent on a slave ship. One of the sailors attempts to rape a female slave, but is stopped by a male slave. \"The sailor unhesitatingly stabs and kills [the male slave],\" he wrote, stating that \"this seems unlikely on its face—slaves are valuable, and the sailor is not the owner. And, sure enough, the scene is not in the book.\"\n\nForrest Wickman of \"Slate\" wrote of Northup's book giving a more favorable account of the author's onetime master, William Ford, than the McQueen film. In Northup's own words, \"There never was a more kind, noble, candid, Christian man than William Ford,\" adding that Ford's circumstances \"blinded [Ford] to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery.\" The movie, however, according to Wickham, \"frequently undermines Ford.\" McQueen undercuts Christianity itself as well, in an effort to update the ethical lessons from Northup's story for the 21st century, by holding the institutions of Christianity up to the light for their ability to justify slavery at the time. Northup was a Christian of his time, writing of his former master being \"blinded\" by \"circumstances\" that in retrospect meant a racist acceptance of slavery despite being a Christian, a position untenable to Christians now and to Christian abolitionists of the 19th century but not contradictory to Northup himself. Valerie Elverton Dixon in \"The Washington Post\" characterized the Christianity depicted in the movie as \"broken\".\n\nEmily West, an associate professor of history at the University of Reading who specializes in the history of slavery in the U.S., said she had \"never seen a film represent slavery so accurately\". Reviewing the film for \"History Extra\", the website of \"BBC History Magazine\", she said: \"The film starkly and powerfully unveiled the sights and sounds of enslavement – from slaves picking cotton as they sang in the fields, to the crack of the lash down people's backs. We also heard a lot about the ideology behind enslavement. Masters such as William Ford and Edwin Epps, although very different characters, both used an interpretation of Christianity to justify their ownership of slaves. They believed the Bible sanctioned slavery, and that it was their 'Christian duty' to preach the scriptures to their slaves.\"\n\n\"12 Years a Slave\" premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on August 30, 2013; it was later screened at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, the New York Film Festival on October 8, the New Orleans Film Festival on October 10, and the Philadelphia Film Festival on October 19. On November 15, 2011, Summit Entertainment announced it had secured a deal to distribute \"12 Years a Slave\" to international markets. In April 2012, a few weeks before principal photography, New Regency Productions agreed to co-finance the film. Because of a distribution pact between 20th Century Fox and New Regency, Fox Searchlight Pictures acquired the film's United States distribution rights. However, instead of paying for the distribution rights, Fox Searchlight made a deal in which it would share box-office proceeds with the financiers of the independently financed film. \"12 Years a Slave\" was commercially released on , 2013 in the United States for a limited release of 19 theaters, with a wide release in subsequent weeks. The film was initially scheduled to be released in late December 2013, but \"some exuberant test screenings\" led to the decision to move up the release date. The film was distributed by Entertainment One in the United Kingdom.\n\nDue to both the film's explicit nature and award contender status, \"12 Years a Slave\"'s financial success was being watched closely. Many analysts compared the film's content to other drama films of a similar vein such as \"Schindler's List\" (1993) and \"The Passion of the Christ\" (2004), which became box office successes despite their respective subject matters. \"It may be a tough subject matter, but when handled well ... films that are tough to sit through can still be commercially successful,\" said Phil Contrino of \"Boxoffice Magazine\". Despite its content, the film's critical success has assisted its domestic distribution by Fox Searchlight that began with a limited released aimed primarily towards art house and African-American patrons. The film's release was gradually widened in subsequent weeks, similarly to how the studio had successfully done in years prior with films such as \"Black Swan\" and \"The Descendants\". International release dates for \"12 Years a Slave\" were largely delayed to early 2014 in order to take advantage of the attention created by awards seasons.\n\nDuring its marketing campaign, \"12 Years a Slave\" received unpaid endorsements by celebrities such as Kanye West and P. Diddy. In a video posted by Revolt, Combs urged viewers to see \"12 Years a Slave\" by stating: \"This movie is very painful but very honest, and is a part of the healing process. I beg all of you to take your kids, everybody to see it. ... You have to see this so you can understand, so you can just start to understand.\"\n\nFollowing its cinematic release in theaters, the Region 1 Code widescreen edition of the film was released on DVD in the United States on March 4, 2014. Special features for the DVD include; a Closed Caption option, The Team – Meet the Creative Minds Assembled by Director Steve McQueen and Bring Solomon Northup's Journey to Life bonus selection, and The Score – Follow Film Composer Hans Zimmer Creating His Dramatic Score feature. In supplemental fashion, a widescreen hi-definition Blu-ray Disc version of the film was also released on the same day. Special features include; a historical portrait from Director Steve McQueen's documentary feature, cast and crew interviews, The Team special feature, and The Score selection. An additional viewing option for the film in the media format of Video on demand has been made available as well.\n\n\"12 Years a Slave\" earned $187.7 million, including $56.7 million in the United States. During its opening limited release in the United States, \"12 Years a Slave\" debuted with a weekend total of $923,715 on 19 screens for a $48,617 per-screen average. The following weekend, the film entered the top ten after expanding to 123 theatres and grossing an additional $2.1 million. It continued to improve into its third weekend, grossing $4.6 million at 410 locations. The film release was expanded to over 1,100 locations on November 8, 2013. In 2014, \"12 Years a Slave\" was the 10th most-illegally downloaded movie, with 23.653 million such downloads, according to \"Variety\".\n\nFilm review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 96% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 338 reviews with an average score of 8.9/10, with the site's consensus stating, \"It's far from comfortable viewing, but \"12 Years a Slave\"s unflinchingly brutal look at American slavery is also brilliant -- and quite possibly essential -- cinema.\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 96 out of 100 based on 56 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be \"universal acclaim\". It is currently one of the site's highest-rated films, as well as the best-reviewed film of 2013. CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film an \"A\" grade.\n\nRichard Corliss of \"TIME\" wrote: \"McQueen's film is closer in its storytelling particulars to such 1970s exploitation-exposés of slavery as \"Mandingo\" and \"Goodbye, Uncle Tom\". Except that McQueen is not a schlockmeister sensationalist but a remorseless artist\". Corliss draws parallels with Nazi Germany, saying, \"McQueen shows that racism, aside from its barbarous inhumanity, is insanely inefficient. It can be argued that Nazi Germany lost the war both because it diverted so much manpower to the killing of Jews and because it did not exploit the brilliance of Jewish scientists in building smarter weapons. So the slave owners dilute the energy of their slaves by whipping them for sadistic sport and, as Epps does, waking them at night to dance for his wife's cruel pleasure.\" Gregory Ellwood of HitFix gave the film an \"A-\" rating, stating, \"\"12 Years\" is a powerful drama driven by McQueen's bold direction and the finest performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor's career.\" He continued by praising the performances of Fassbender and Nyong'o, citing Nyong'o as \"the film's breakthrough performance [that] may find Nyong'o making her way to the Dolby Theater next March\". He also admired the film's \"gorgeous\" cinematography and the musical score, as \"one of Hans Zimmer's more moving scores in some time\". Paul MacInnes of \"The Guardian\" scored the film five out of five stars, writing, \"Stark, visceral and unrelenting, \"12 Years a Slave\" is not just a great film but a necessary one.\"\n\nOwen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised it as \"a new movie landmark of cruelty and transcendence\" and as \"a movie about a life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is\". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, \"\"12 Years a Slave\" lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments it is hard to watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\", gave the film a four-star rating and said: \"you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What we have here is a blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic.\" He later named the film the best movie of 2013.\n\nManohla Dargis wrote, in her review for \"The New York Times\", \"the genius of \"12 Years a Slave\" is its insistence on banal evil, and on terror, that seeped into souls, bound bodies and reaped an enduring, terrible price\". \"The Daily Telegraph's\" Tim Robey granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that \"it's the nobility of this remarkable film that pierces the soul\", while praising Ejiofor and Nyong'o's performances. Tina Hassannia of \"Slant Magazine\" said that \"using his signature visual composition and deafening sound design, Steve McQueen portrays the harrowing realism of Northup's experience and the complicated relationships between master and slave, master and master, slave and slave, and so on\". David Simon, the creator of the TV series \"The Wire\", highly praised the movie, commenting that \"it marks the first time in history that our entertainment industry, albeit with international creative input, has managed to stare directly at slavery and maintain that gaze\".\n\nThe film, however, was not without its criticisms. Stephanie Zacharek of \"The Village Voice\" was more critical of the film. While praising Ejiofor's work, she stated: \"It's a picture that stays more than a few safe steps away from anything so dangerous as raw feeling. Even when it depicts inhuman cruelty, as it often does, it never compromises its aesthetic purity.\" Peter Malamud Smith of \"Slate\" criticized the story, saying, \"\"12 Years a Slave\" is constructed as a story of a man trying to return to his family, offering every viewer a way into empathizing with its protagonist. Maybe we need a story framed on that individual scale in order to understand it. But it has a distorting effect all the same. We're more invested in one hero than in millions of victims; if we're forced to imagine ourselves enslaved, we want to imagine ourselves as Northup, a special person who miraculously escaped the system that attempted to crush him.\" Describing this as \"the hero problem\", Malamud Smith concluded his review explaining, \"We can handle \"12 Years a Slave\". But don't expect \"60 Years a Slave\" any time soon. And \"200 Years, Millions of Slaves\"? Forget about it.\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of \"The A.V. Club\" opined that McQueen is \"essentially tone-deaf when it comes to performance, and skirts by on casting\". The film \"lacks a necessary emotional continuity. I don't think it's something the movie is denying in the way it intentionally denies so many other conventions; it's still structured around an ending that's supposed to function as a release, but because it can’t organize that sense of catharsis it so badly needs, it just feels as though McQueen is scurrying for an exit. Also: The cast is wildly uneven.\" At \"The Guardian\", black Canadian author Orville Lloyd Douglas said he would not be seeing \"12 Years a Slave\", explaining: \"I'm convinced these black race films are created for a white, liberal film audience to engender white guilt and make them feel bad about themselves. Regardless of your race, these films are unlikely to teach you anything you don't already know.\"\n\nTimothy Sneed said in \"U.S. News & World Report\" the year after the film was released, \"Doubts still lingered about its ability to truly bring about a newfound racial consciousness among a national, mainstream audience ... The film also was a period piece that featured a happy ending ushered in by a 'white savior' in the form of Brad Pitt's character.\"\n\n\"12 Years a Slave\" has received numerous awards and nominations. It earned three Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama. The film also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film, while Ejiofor received the Best Actor award. In addition, the motion picture has been named as one of the best films of 2013 by various ongoing critics, appearing on 100 critics' top-ten lists in which 25 had the film in their number-one spot. This is both the most of any film released in its production year.\n\n"}

His mother, Marjorie \"Margi\" (\"née\" Marrow), is an elementary school teacher, and his father, Joe, is a photographer. He has two sisters, Johanna and Darrow. He is Jewish, although he describes himself as \"not particularly religious.\" His grandfather was industrial psychologist and philanthropist Alfred J. Marrow, and his third cousin is U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, of Wisconsin.\n\nSamberg attended elementary school with his \"Brooklyn Nine Nine\" co-star Chelsea Peretti. Samberg discovered \"Saturday Night Live\" as a child, while sneaking past his parents to watch professional wrestling on television. He was obsessed with the show and his devotion to comedy was frustrating to teachers who felt he was distracted from his schoolwork. Samberg graduated from Berkeley High School in 1996, where he became interested in creative writing and has stated that \"[writing classes] were the ones that I put all my effort into... that's what I cared about and that's what I ended up doing.\" He attended college at University of California, Santa Cruz for two years before transferring to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he graduated in 2000. Writer Murray Miller was his roommate.\n\nSamberg majored in experimental film. He became a YouTube and Internet star and made his own comedy videos with his two friends Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. When YouTube was created in 2005, the streaming of their videos became much more widespread over the Internet. Samberg became a featured player on \"SNL\" in part because of the work he had done on their sketch comedy website TheLonelyIsland.com, which helped them land an agent and eventually get hired at \"SNL\".

Because the role has roots in the United Kingdom, they are most common in the English-speaking world.\n\nWhile an animateur is likely to have some skill in performance (with voice or instrument), conducting, teaching and possibly composition or arrangement, their principal role is to assist the communication of the performers and the audience. If working with a symphony orchestra, for instance, they might accomplish this through running participatory workshops to introduce audience members to aspects of the music to be performed, or by facilitating dialogue between performers and audience members.\n\nThere are animateurs in a wide number of musical styles. While they are probably most common in classical music, they also work in jazz, gamelan and some forms of African traditional music. Often they are employed by an orchestra, concert hall or music education service, though some also work freelance accepting commissions from groups or organisations for a specific occasion. Animateurs also work with children (where the discipline can approach a form of musical youth work) as well as adults. Possibly the best known animateur in the United Kingdom is Gareth Malone, who for some years ran the youth and community choirs at the London Symphony Orchestra's music education center, LSO St Luke's prior to applying the same skills in a series of television programmes.\n"}

In 2018, Faith Erin Hicks took over as writer with Peter Wartman as artist for the next graphic novel trilogy, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender – Imbalance\". \n\n and Sokka return to their home village in the Southern Water Tribe, discovering that it has been transformed into a bustling and thriving city reminiscent of the Northern Water Tribe, and that their father Hakoda has been elected leader of the entire south. Though Sokka is enthusiastic at the changes, Katara fears that their tribe is losing its cultural identity. While dining out with Malina and her brother Maliq, the northerners in charge of the redevelopment process, thieves steal a briefcase containing important documents from Maliq, with Malina getting injured in the struggle.\n\nKatara and Sokka follow the thieves to a secret hideout occupied by a group of southern nationalists, who resent the northern tribe's imposition of their values onto the southern tribe, as well as Hakoda's complicity in the matter. Their leader, Gilak, expresses his belief that Malina and Maliq have a hidden agenda, before Katara and Sokka escape the group and return to the city. During their escape, the pair run into Thod, Gilak's second in command, who tells them of a story of a snow rat with the ability to talk and walk on two feet who endeared himself to a human tribe, only to be driven away by them when he asked to be treated as an equal. The siblings and Maliq enter the tent where Malina is recovering with Hakoda by her side, only to discover the pair of them kissing.\n\nHakoda investigates the nationalists' hideout, only to discover it abandoned with a note informing him that he will soon see the truth. Elsewhere, Katara and Sokka learn from Malina and Maliq that, as part of the redevelopment process, they will be extracting from a massive oil reservoir recently discovered in the Southern Water Tribe, in order to enable a new age of machinery in which machines become part of everyday life. Katara continues to have issues with Malina and her relationship with Hakoda, owing to her plans and unintentionally offensive remarks towards the South. Further conversation reveals that Malina and Maliq are business partners of Toph's father, with Toph herself later arriving as a representative of her father.\n\nAt a festival thrown by Malina and Maliq, Katara and Sokka meet up with Aang, who has returned from helping to solve . As Malina makes a speech about her plans, the festival is attacked by Gilak's nationalists, with Gilak accusing her and Maliq of attempting to seize the oil for the Northern Water Tribe, in order to make the Southern Tribe a puppet state of the North. As proof, he cites the documents that were stolen from Maliq. Malina admits that she had originally planned to give the oil to the North, out of fear the South would be unable to handle it properly, but changed her mind upon meeting Hakoda and seeing that the South was capable of doing so. Maliq however insists that they carry on with the original plan, decrying the South as culturally backwards and incapable of governing itself, let alone managing the oil.\n\nMalina agrees to step down from the redevelopment project and leave the South Pole with all her people in an attempt to defuse the situation, but Gilak and the nationalists attack. In the ensuing battle, Thod reminds Katara of the story he told her, comparing the humans' treatment of the snow rat to the North's low opinion of the South, to convince her to join Gilak, but she refuses. Later on, Hakoda attempts to persuade Gilak to give up his crusade, but Gilak stabs Hakoda in the chest before he and his men are captured. The night following the battle, Sokka and Katara briefly argue over the South's future, Sokka pointing out that Malina and Maliq's plan of using the oil has merits, Katara unwilling to allow the South to lose its cultural identity. Elsewhere, as Gilak sits in his prison cell, one of Hakoda's officers smuggles him the key to his cell door, having been convinced of his opinions.\n\nTo continue the redevelopment of the South, Toph brings her metalbending students over to help with construction, while Hakoda invites Fire Lord Zuko and Earth King Kuei over to discuss a collaborative reconstruction effort between the three nations. The meeting is interrupted when Gilak and his nationalists escape their imprisonment and force their way into the meeting room, kidnapping Kuei during the subsequent fight. Gilak, who by now considers Hakoda a traitor to the South due to his willingness to collaborate with foreigners, demands that Hakoda turn himself over in exchange for Kuei's return.\n\nThe two groups meet at the Bridge of No Return, a rope bridge once used to exile Southern Water Tribe criminals. As part of the exchange agreement, Aang, Katara, Toph and Zuko agree to be chi-blocked by the nationalists, before Hakoda and Kuei are sent across the bridge. Once the two men are in the middle of the bridge, Gilak attempts to collapse it and kill them both, but he is foiled by Malina and Toph's metalbending students, who had sneaked over to the other side of the bridge prior to the exchange. Aang, Katara and Toph then subdue the nationalists on their side of the bridge, having used chainmail armor designed by Sokka and the metalbending students to avoid being chi-blocked.\n\nHis forces beaten, Gilak destroys the bridge in order to kill Hakoda, while Malina tries to stop him. Aang barely manages to carry the three of them whilst flying his glider, but Gilak's attempts to kill Hakoda cause him to lose his grip and fall to his death. Fearing that Aang will not be able to carry both her and Hakoda, Malina attempts to sacrifice herself for the other two by letting go of Hakoda's hand, professing her love for him as she does so, but she is saved by Katara.\n\nThe next day, Katara and Sokka visits their mother Kya's grave, and Katara admits that her ideal Southern Water Tribe would be one where her beloved mother was still alive. She then states that she has felt her mother's spirit support her last night, and on her previous adventures, and with this belief that her mother has been with her all along, she is subsequently able to accept the changes happening in the South more easily. The characters then meet up in Gran-Gran's hut for a feast that includes cuisine from all of their cultures.\n"}

Its original name was Théâtre de Complicite. The company is based in London and uses extreme movement to represent their work. \"The Company's inimitable style of visual and devised theatre [has] an emphasis on strong, corporeal, poetic and surrealist image supporting text\" (Stephen Knapper, 2010, Contemporary European Theatre Directors). Its work has been influenced by Jacques Lecoq. The company produced their first work in 1983. In 1985 they won the Perrier Comedy Award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Their productions often involve dazzling use of technology, such as projection and cameras, as well as lyrical and philosophical contemplation of serious themes.\n\nThe company's lineup changes frequently, though McBurney continues to be the artistic director. Complicite is currently more active as an international touring company than within the UK. The Company is currently led from their base in London by producer, Judith Dimant. \n\nMajor productions include \"The Master and Margarita\" (2011/12), \"A Dog's Heart\" (2010) with De Nederlandse Opera and English National Opera, \"Endgame\" (2009), \"Shun-kin\" (2008), \"A Disappearing Number\" (2007), \"Measure for Measure\" (2004), \"The Elephant Vanishes\" (2003, 2004) (performed in Japanese, adapted from the work of the writer Haruki Murakami), \"The Noise of Time\" (2000) (about the Russian composer Dimitri Shostakovich, title from the 1925 memoir and collected essays by the poet Osip Mandelstam, published in English in 1993); \"Mnemonic\" (1999); and \"The Street of Crocodiles\" (1992) (inspired by the life and works of Bruno Schulz).\n\n\"The Master and Margarita\", an adaptation of Mikhail Bulgakov’s novel, sold out its run at The Barbican, London in March/April 2012 and tours Europe in 2012.

{"id": "53586358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53586358", "title": "Conservation and restoration of film", "text": "Conservation and restoration of film\n\nThe conservation and restoration of film is the physical care and treatment of film-based materials (plastic supports). These include photographic materials and motion picture.\n\nCellulose nitrate (circa 1889 - circa 1950) is the first of film supports. It can be found as roll film, motion picture film, and sheet film. It is difficult to determine the dates when all nitrate film was discontinued, however, Eastman Kodak last manufactured nitrate film in 1951. Cellulose nitrate is cellulose fibers modified with nitric acid to create a nitrocellulose solid. Cellulose nitrate is extremely flammable and capable of burning even in the absence of oxygen and underwater. It has been the cause of many fires and losses of motion picture films, photographic materials, and archival records. \n\nCellulose acetate is also known as \"safety\" film and started to replace nitrate film in the 1920s. There are several types of acetate that were produced after 1925, which include diacetate (circa 1923-circa 1955), acetate propionate (1927-circa 1949), acetate butyrate (1936-present), and triacetate (circa 1950-present). The earliest, diacetate, was found to be inferior to nitrate because it had high shrinkage rates. Eastman Kodak then worked with mixed esters of cellulose to create acetate butyrate and acetate propionate, which were used for sheet film, X-rays, amateur roll film, and aerial maps, but they were still found to be inferior to nitrate by the motion picture industry. Triacetate was then produced and is still in production for roll film today.\n\nPolyester (1955 - present) started to replace acetate as a film support for many types of sheet film; however, due to its rigidity, it cannot be used as roll film. Polyester can also be identified as \"safety\" film. It is inherently more stable than both cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate, because it is a synthetic polymer that is inert (chemically inactive). It shows exceptional chemical stability and physical performance. A polarization test can be used to identify polyester from cellulose acetate or nitrate. When viewed between cross-polarized filters, polyester will exhibit red and green interference colors, similar to a rainbow moiré pattern. Nitrate and acetate films will not show these interference colors.\n\nPerforated roll films create for sale or theatrical distribution typically found in 35 mm, but also 65 mm, 70 mm, and other gauges. Seen on reels, rolls, strips or frames. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester.\n\nFound in short rolls and may be cut after processing into strips or single images. Includes 35 mm, still-camera negatives, 120 and 220 size roll films and slide (transparency) films. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester.\n\nFound in short rolls and may be cut after processing into strips or single images. Includes 35 mm, still-camera negatives, 120 and 220 size roll films and slide (transparency) films. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester.\n\nRoll film with a ferromagnetic coating. Seen on rolls or reels and a variety of gauges. Can be acetate or polyester.\n\nSheets or roll film in sizes of 4x5, 8x10, and 10x10; can splice together single sheets into larger rolls. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester.\n\nRoll film in 35mm and 16mm widths, and 105mm microfiche. Can be reels, rolls, cards, or sheets. Can be acetate or polyester.\n\nSingle-sheets of film commonly found in sizes of 4x5, 5x7, and 8x10 inches. Also known as flat film. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester.\n\nLarge format sheet film, 8x10 or larger. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester.\n\nThe deterioration of both cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate negatives is highly dependent on temperature and relative humidity. Storing materials at room temperature or warmer, and with high humidity, will inevitably cause deterioration. Extreme fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity will rapidly increase the rate of deterioration.\n\nPermanent display of photographs is not recommended; most photographic materials are vulnerable in varying degrees to deterioration caused by light. Damage caused by light is cumulative and depends on the intensity, length of exposure, and the wavelength of the radiation. Visible light in blue part of the spectrum (400 to 500 nanometers), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (300-to 400 nanometer region) are especially damaging. Sunlight and standard fluorescent light are both strong sources of UV. Color slides are particularly susceptible to fading when exposed to both visible and UV light.\n\nAir pollution attacks photographs in the form of oxidant gases, particulate matter, acidic and sulfiding gases, and environmental fumes. Oxidant gases are composed primarily of pollution created by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This can cause photographic images to fade. Particulate matter, such as soot and ash particles from manufacturing processes, exists in abundance outdoors and can enter the library or archives through heating and cooling ducts, doors, and windows. Particulates, which may be greasy, abrasive, and chemically or biologically active, settle on shelves and on collection materials and create dust that is spread to other materials when they are handled. The by-products of combustion combined with moisture in the atmosphere pose another risk to photographic materials. These acids attack all components of photographs and cause silver images to fade and paper and board supports to discolor and become brittle. Environmental fumes can be especially damaging to photographic images even in small quantities.\n\nPoor storage, such as lack of enclosures, can lead to deterioration through exposure to light and pollution. Additionally, materials that are not carefully and safely stored can rub against each other, causing scratching and abrasions. Storing film materials in basements, attics, or garages can cause rapid deterioration through extreme temperature and humidity fluctuations, but also through exposure to insects and rodents. Storing materials on the floor can also increase the risk of damage by water leaks, insects and rodents.\n\nFilm can be mishandled causing physical damage. Working at dirty workstations or using bad rollers for motion picture film can cause dirt, scratches, and abrasions. Tears can occur when the film is stressed during winding or projection, in addition to improper threading. Repeated use, including the repeated insertion and removal of film from sleeves can also cause scratches and abrasions. Ignorance, neglect, and carelessness account for a significant percentage of damage to photographs.\n\nMajor silver deterioration occurs when photographs are not correctly processed and washed. Over time, residual fixer left in the photograph causes the image, binder, and support to turn yellow or brown and the silver image to fade. High temperature and humidity speed this process. Photographs that were not well fixed remain light sensitive and may darken when exposed to light.\n\nCellulose nitrate is chemically unstable; decay is irreversible and autocatalytic. When the film deteriorates, it turns yellow, brittle and sticky. The off-gassing of nitrate produces hazardous and corrosive products (nitrogen oxides form nitric acid) along with an acrid smell that cause fading of the silver image, decomposition of the gelatin binder, and the eventual destruction of the plastic support and image material. These products (nitric acid, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) are destructive to other film-based negatives, and especially to photographic prints. Other artifacts, metals for instance, will be harmed by proximity to deteriorated nitrate material. Such gasses can cause skin, eye, and respiratory irritations. Allergic sensitivity has also been noted, as has dizziness and lightheadedness. \n\nCaused by the loss of elasticity in the plastic film base over time. The film can snap or break under strain, and will no longer have flexibility. \n\nThe loss of the original dimensionality of the film and is irreversible.\n\nDistortion is caused by uneven shrinkage across a film's dimension and starts to warp or curl. This can be due to the difference in shrinkage between the film and emulsion layers, or areas of the film that start to shrink more than other areas. Temporary distortion can be reversed, but permanent distortion cannot.\n\nAs the film is exposed to moisture, heat, and acids, nitrogen oxides are produced, which creates nitric acid. These promote silver corrosion and decompose the gelatin emulsion layer. The chemical reactions that occur cause further nitrate decay. Softness and stickiness occur and the image starts to fade away. This is irreversible.\n\nWhen exposed to moisture in the environment and various pollutants, the image silver will corrode, creating a reflective metallic sheen on the emulsion side. Typically starts at the edges of the film. Poor quality enclosures and storage can hasten the process.\n\nThese small pink, orange or yellow spots can found in the image area and are often found in microfilm. These are created by local oxidation of metallic silver due to moisture and pollutants in the environment.\nDeterioration of nitrate film is often categorized in six stages, or levels: \n\n\nWhile considered \"safety film\" as it produces less hazards than nitrate, cellulose acetate still faces stability issues. The deterioration of acetate is autocatalytic just like nitrate: once the deterioration process starts, the degradation products induce further deterioration. If not properly cared for and preserved, cellulose acetate will become acidic, and face many of the same issues that nitrate faces. Deteriorated acetate can also emit a noticeable odor, and can cause the same skin, eye, and respiratory irritations as nitrate does, in addition to dizziness and lightheadedness. \n\nVinegar Syndrome is the release of acetic acid which produces a strong vinegary odor. AD strips are dye-coated paper strips that can detect and measure the severity of vinegar syndrome in film collections. The strips change color, shifting from a blue to green to level, based on the level of acidity found. If the AD strip level remains at blue, the film is in good condition and no deterioration is present. If the AD strip level turns yellow, the film condition is in critical condition, creating a possible handling hazard, and should be frozen immediately.\n\nCaused by the loss of elasticity in the plastic film base over time. The film can snap or break under strain, and will no longer have flexibility.\n\nThe acetic acid that is released in cellulose acetate negatives can trigger the retrieval of the color dyes in the backing layer, known as the anti-halation layer, giving the negative a blue or pink appearance. This is irreversible. \n\nPlasticizer additives that move to the surface of the film and form crystals or bubbles as the acetate film deteriorates. This is irreversible.\n\nThe loss of the original dimensionality of the film and is irreversible.\n\nDistortion is caused by uneven shrinkage across a film's dimension and starts to warp or curl. This can be due to the difference in shrinkage between the film and emulsion layers, or areas of the film that start to shrink more than other areas. Temporary distortion can be reversed, but permanent distortion cannot.\n\nAs the film decays, acetic acid is released from the film support, which causes the gelatin layer to separate from the film support. This is a form of advanced acetate decay and can be accompanied by embrittlement and the exudation of plasticizers. While delamination is irreversible, skilled professionals can perform conservation treatments to save the image.\n\nFound in color films, dye fading reduces the overall density of the image resulting in loss of contrast and shifts in color balance. This is irreversible, however, digital restoration techniques can be used to approximate the original color balance and information.\n\nWhen exposed to moisture in the environment and various pollutants, the image silver will corrode, creating a reflective metallic sheen on the emulsion side. Typically starts at the edges of the film. Poor quality enclosures and storage can hasten the process.\n\nThese small pink, orange or yellow spots can found in the image area and are often found in microfilm. These are created by local oxidation of metallic silver due to moisture and pollutants in the environment.\n\nDeterioration of cellulose acetate is often categorized into the following levels, or stages:\n\n\nBecause polyester is an inert and stable plastic, it does not possess the same deterioration concerns as celluloid films. Polyester can be stored at room temperature and does not need cold storage for preservation. Polyester is also used as an archival enclosure option for materials, such as Mylar and Melinex brand products. \n\nWhile polyester film is stable, the chromogenic dyes found in color negatives on polyester supports are not permanent and may fade rapidly at room temperature.\n\nPreventive conservation actions such as environmental monitoring, good storage, and promoting proper handling through staff and user education, will have a lasting, positive impact on the preservation of a collection.\nKeeping film cold and dry is ideal; however, a cool environment (40 to 60 degrees) is better than room temperature or higher as it will slow down the deterioration process. The best storage conditions for both black & white and color cellulose acetate film are cold (-15° to 4° C/ 5° to 39° F) and dry (30% to 40% relative humidity) environments for cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate films in both color and black and white, and color on polyester supports. Black and white film on polyester supports may be stored at a temperature of 18º C (65º F) or lower and a relative humidity of 30% to 40%.\n\nFreezing film is the ideal temperature to preserve film for the long-term. At freezing temperatures, the natural decomposition of cellulose nitrate and acetate is slowed down. Cold storage is predicted to extend the life of acetate negatives by a factor of ten or more.\n\nThree layers of protection are recommended for the storage of film base photographic materials. Negatives and positives should be placed in sleeves or envelopes, which are then placed in a box or drawer, and these boxes or drawers on shelves or in a cabinet. Motion picture film and microfilm should be stored in unsealed containers in cabinets or on shelves. Labels such as acid-free, lignin-free, or buffered do not guarantee that a material is safe to use with photographic materials. Chemically inert papers may be harmful to the photographic image; the only way to be certain of the stability of the paper is to purchase materials that have passed the Photographic Activity Test (PAT). There are also considerations to be made regarding paper or plastic enclosures. Factors such as use, handling, and cost should be considered when selecting archival storage materials. There are several resources provided in the external links section below that can assist with the selection of proper storage materials for photographic materials. \n\nFilm materials should be stored in interior rooms away from exterior walls and places that do not have extreme temperature fluctuations. Furthermore, film materials should not be stored near sources of heat (sunlight, radiators, heaters), water (bathrooms, sprinklers), or near chemical or exhaust fumes. Storage environments should be regularly monitored to check temperature and humidity controls, HVAC systems, and pest-free. Quantities of nitrate film in excess of 25 pounds are subject to storage and handling standards prescribed by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). \n\nSeriously deteriorated negatives of any type should be isolated from those in good condition.\n\nPhotographic materials should always be covered when not in use. Storing film-based materials in containers and boxes will keep light away from the materials. When exhibiting or using these materials, a low light level should be used. The installation of low-UV-emitting bulbs or UV-absorbing fluorescent bulb sleeves can help eliminate this problem. UV filtering window glazing or the installation of window shades may also help. Low- UV-emitting bulbs and sleeves are available from several manufacturers. Light levels in storage areas can also be controlled by the use of timed shut-off switches. Dark cloths or sheets of folder stock (heavyweight paper) or mat board should be available in reading rooms for covering objects when not in use by readers.\n\nAir entering the storage area should be filtered and purified to remove particulate and gaseous matter. A well-designed filtration system includes cellulose or fiberglass filters that remove particulate matter, and chemical absorption system that filters out gaseous pollutants. Air filters must be changed regularly to be effective. Air circulation should also be checked periodically.\n\nWhen handling film, the user should always have clean hands and wear gloves (cotton or nitrile) to avoid fingerprints or scratches. Always handle the film by the edge to avoid touching the image surface. Users must be careful when removing film from enclosures to avoid scratches or abrasions. Never force rolled film flat if it is brittle, as it can snap or break. Always work in an uncluttered and clean environment that is well-lit and ventilated. It's also beneficial to avoid wearing jewelry, such as long necklaces, that can accidentally scratch the film when being examined. Food and drinks should be kept in a separate room or a safe distance from the film materials. It is also advisable to limit exposure times to celluloid film, wear googles and a respirator. \n\nAny negatives that show signs of deterioration should be digitized as soon as possible. Without immediate restoration followed by a change to proper long-term storage, the environmental factors that caused the early signs of damage will continue, leading eventually to irreparable damage and permanent loss of the film’s content. Nitrate and safety negatives that need to be handled but are in good condition should still generally be digitized. The digital image can then be used as an access copy while the original remains in cold storage. A wide array of digital systems are available for capturing and storing photographic images, and an institution should have a digital preservation policy in place. Digitization requires active management to ensure the digitized copies are not corrupted or lost. There are many factors to consider when digitizing photographic materials. The Northeast Document Conservation Center provides information and resources on Digital Preservation.\n\nTransferring negatives to a more stable support such as polyester is the best way to preserve the longevity of the images.\n\nDeteriorated film that requires conservation work should be conducted by a photograph conservator. There are several resources available to aid in finding a conservator for your needs, including the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), the Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC), and the Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts (CCAHA).\n\nIt is not recommended to perform conservation treatments on nitrate. The best options are cold storage to prevent further deterioration (especially if the film is found to be in the lower levels of deterioration), digitize the nitrate film, or duplicate the nitrate film onto a more stable support like polyester. If the nitrate is found to be at the higher levels of deterioration, it is recommended that the original nitrate film be destroyed due to the health and safety hazards. \n\nCold storage is the best option for preventive conservation of cellulose acetate film as it slows down the deterioration process. As with nitrate, it is also suggested that digitization and duplication efforts are useful in providing access copies. However, it is possible to perform some conservation treatments on acetate film. \n\n\"Stripping\" is a technique that is used by trained conservators on channeled acetate film. This process allows the conservator to separate the gelatin emulsion layer from the deteriorating acetate film base in a bath and then reattach or duplicate the gelatin emulsion layer onto another sheet of film. This process is quite tedious and expensive, and not always successful, therefore it is not always a viable option for everyone.\n\nAs described above, celluloid materials are chemically unstable and will naturally deteriorate over time. Once the materials have reached high levels of deterioration, the film often faces irreversible damage, including image loss. It's important to digitize or duplicate these materials before they face irreversible damage.\n\nCold storage (freezers) can be costly and prohibitive for many institutions. Digitization can also be costly; factors that need to be considered are size and use of collection, space available for storage, and financial resources. \n\nDeteriorated photographs may require specialized conservation treatment by a professional photograph conservator, often a costly, skill-demanding, and time-consuming procedure. For the majority of photographs in research collections, single-item conservation of deteriorated photographs is probably not a feasible or a cost-effective preservation solution.\n\nCold storage can be prohibitive for access due to the acclimation periods required to use the film.\n\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has several standards regarding photography, photographic paper, films, and plates, as well as the safe housing and storage environments of photographic materials including the Photographic Activity Test (PAT). \n\nA sample of some of the ISO standards that relate to film preservation and storage:\nThe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) also has a list of technical standards pertaining to the care and handling of photographic materials. \n\nA sample of some of the ANSI standards include:\n\nThere are several Codes of Ethics for professionals working in conservation and preservation-related fields. The main conservation Code of Ethics is the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) \"Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice\". However, many of the professional organizations have their own codes, such as the Society of American Archivists \"Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics\". \n\n\n\n"}

The game also features an all-new soundtrack featuring licensed music from the past four decades as well as new Konami Originals. Hottest Party 2 was released on September 16, 2008 in North America. A teaser site for the Japanese release was launched on December 9, 2008 featuring new gameplay footage from the game.\n\n\"Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2\" was announced on May 15, 2008 alongside \"Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3\" and \"Dance Dance Revolution X\" by Konami on the DDR Online Community website as part of Game Day 2008. A sequel to the 2007 \"Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party\", Hottest Party 2 features many improvements. Konami promises an entirely new soundtrack featuring music from the \"last four decades\", more innovative Wii Remote and Nunchuk support, four-player multiplayer and brand new gameplay modes. Hottest Party 2 features a difficulty range that allows both new players and seasoned dancers to enjoy the game. Mii support will be added to the game, allowing players to incorporate their Mii avatars onto the dance floor. Courses, a mode featured in the mainstream \"Dance Dance Revolution\" series, will be introduced on the Wii for the first time. Dance gimmicks such as Triple Stomp and Dance N' Defend Battle Mode will add new dynamics to the standard gameplay. New dancing characters will be introduced and the dancers will show off realistic dance moves that players can watch and practice in special mode. New dancing stages with greater detail will be added to the game, more than 50 total environments for the characters to dance in. Konami also announced a sample of the music to be included in Hottest Party 2, including covers of \"Black or White\" by Michael Jackson, Umbrella\" by Rihanna, \"We Got the Beat\" by The Go-Go's, and the inclusion of Justice's D.A.N.C.E. A teaser trailer and a series of gameplay screenshots were released by Konami alongside the announcement.\n\nOn August 1, 2008 The \"Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2\" teaser website was updated with a new trailer revealing additional information about the upcoming game, alongside the new song \"Into Your Heart\", by series producer Naoki Maeda. The updated dancers with new dance moves are featured, along with the detailed stages featuring club style lighting, video walls and live crowds, new gimmicks that shrink the size of the on-screen arrows to varying degrees, the first appearance of Training Mode on the Wii, Dance N' Defend Battle Mode in action and the 360 degree dancing character viewer.\n\nGameplay remains relatively unchanged from the original game, as players must step on the marked arrows on a dance pad controller, or wave their Wii Remote or Nunchuck when the corresponding arrow or hand marker passes through a set of static arrows on-screen to the beat of a song. When played with the Wii Remote, a separate \"hand combo\" attached to the lifebar increases if the player can keep the beat of the song with the controller while in play. These hand combos can add a bonus to the player's score when a hand marker is eventually reached.\n\nNew modes on Hottest Party 2 include a battle mode and the \"Groove Arena\", an updated version of Groove Circuit from the previous version. As with the previous game, songs can also contain special \"gimmick\" arrows with unique behaviors. New arrow gimmicks on \"Hottest Party 2\" include arrows that rebound when hit and must be hit three times in order for them to fully disappear, and arrows that only appear suddenly.\n\nThe songs in yellow are licenses, the songs in white are Konami Originals, the songs in red are \"boss songs\", and the songs in green are featured in existing games. The songs with padlocks next to them are locked until certain conditions are met in the game, and songs with a clapperboard next to them have music videos featured.\n\nThe original soundtrack for FuruFuru Party was bundled with the original soundtrack for \"Dance Dance Revolution X\", and was released on January 29, 2009. It was part of the pre-order bundles for the PlayStation 2 version of DDR X in Japan, which was released the same day.\n\nIt has been discovered that DDR Hottest Party 2 is not compatible with some 3rd party dance mats made for \"Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix\" and 3rd party mats made for \"Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party\". Cable converters, such as those made by DDR Game, exist to get around this issue. It is compatible with most Gamecube pads, even when used as 2nd/3rd/4th player.\n\nDuring its presentation at E3 2008, critics praised \"Hottest Party 2\" for its ease of play. Chris Watters of GameSpot felt the training modes would be useful for newer players to learn the game's fundamentals, and while IGN's Lucas M. Thomas noted that \"Hottest Party 2\" was not \"drastically different\" from the previous version (continuing a model of releasing yearly installments with greater emphasis on new content rather than making larger changes to the game), he still felt the game remained just as accessible to new players as earlier entries in the franchise, and sarcastically commented that the ability to have Mii heads on realistic bodies as dancers \"doesn't look disturbing at all.\"\n\n1UP.com gave \"Hottest Party 2\" a \"B\" rating, concluding that the game \"succeeds in several areas where last year's version fell short.\" Specific praise went to its use of full choreography for the on-screen characters rather than randomized moves, and to its soundtrack contained fewer \"generic\" songs than the previous game. The game's Battle mode was considered to be a \"positively nightmarish\" experience, and the \"Groove Arena\" mode was singled out for providing a \"rewarding sense of progress\" through its pace of providing new content.\n\nWorthPlaying.com's Jesse Littlefield gave the game a 6.6/10, complimenting some of the additions to gameplay and Wii Remote support. However, the stages and characters were dubbed \"poorly detailed\" and the covered songs were declared to be \"sub-standard\", although the Konami Originals were considered the \"better half\" of the soundtrack. The lack of online play was also criticized.\n\n"}
{"id": "32163038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32163038", "title": "DarkOrbit", "text": "DarkOrbit\n\nDarkOrbit, later renamed to DarkOrbit: Reloaded is a massively multiplayer online game developed by Bigpoint Games. The game is set in outer space, where players control a spaceship to battle against non-player characters and other players. It is a three-dimensional isometric Flash game with over 100 million registered accounts.\n\nDarkOrbit was released on December 11, 2006, based on deleted WildTangent's game with the same name.\n\nOriginally this game was created for German players.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player chooses between three companies : Venus Resources Unlimited (VRU), Earth Industries Corporation (EIC) and Mars Mining Operations (MMO). In the story, one more company exists (Saturn Autonomous Technology) but not for the players. Players are teleported to the home map to begin quests from Mission Control.\n\nThe object of the game is to gain wealth and power both individually and for the company.\n\nThis is a formula that will divide your Experience by 100,000 and Honor by 100, which will equal your top user points. Top user points show up in the hall of fame.\n\nRank points are also based on a mathematical formula that is figured by a variety of factors, such as experience, level, honor, quests finished, Ships Points destroyed, Alien Points destroyed, and your ship type. There are also factors that will reduce your rank points such as times destroyed, own company kills, radiation zone destructions, and phoenix (starter) ships destroyed. Rank Points do not show up in the hall of fame.\n\nDarkOrbit uses two types of currencies: credits and uridium. Uridium, common abbreviated \"Uri\", is more valuable and harder to obtain. Some types of equipment and ammunition can be purchased using credits, however the most valuable or \"elite\" items can only be bought with uridium. However, for some of those elite items, there is an option to bid using credits. This auction system is used to control inflation of credits.\nMany new items are not offered in trade. The P.E.T. 10 is a highly priced drone that increases with costs as the player levels it up. Ship designs are also available in the auction.However, certain valuable equipment such as Drone designs or Elite laser ammo are not available in the auction.\nUridium can be purchased in exchange for real money via PayPal, credit card, or another method of payment. Uridium can't be traded.\n\nDarkOrbit utilizes a real-time combat system. In combat, a variety of weapons can be used to destroy aliens and other players. These include laser cannons, laser ammunition, rockets, rocket launchers, and mines. Players need to click on their target to lock on before they can begin shooting. Successfully destroying an enemy will result in a \"cargo box\" containing ore being dropped that the player can take. \"If the destroyed ship is a player, it will cost 500 Uridium to repair the ship, although the ship started with in the game is free to repair.\" This was available only before Darkorbit Reloaded. At the moment, you can choose to repair your ship for free, spawning at your home base, paying 700 Uridium (or one repair credit + 200 Uridium) to spawn at the nearest portal on the map (note that on 4-x maps there are not demilitarized zones, so be careful), or you can pay 800 Uridium (or one repair credit + 300 Uridium) to spawn at the same spot your ship got destroyed.\n\nPlayers start of the game with a Phoenix, a free but easily destroyed ship. As the player advances in the game, he/she can buy better ships. There are a total of 53 different ships that can be bought, with the Goliath, the Aegis, the Citadel, and the Vengeance typically being regarded as the best ships. Some ships can only be purchased with real money during special events. Ships can be equipped with a variety of items, including shield generators, speed engines, laser cannons, rocket launchers, ammunition, and many other accessories.\n\nPlayers can join a clan if they pay 1,500 credits. Benefits of joining a clan include help from clan mates and clan payouts in the form of credits. However, most clans have a clan tax (between 0% and 5%) that is collected into the clans treasury daily. Clans can help players level up, gain credits and compete against other rivals. In addition, a player can found a clan for 300,000 credits. There is also a page in the game that allows you to see which clan players are online, if they are ready for action on your map or if they are offline. The menu also allows you to invite them into group without having to write their name.\nalso if you are part of a clan member you can have wars with others and fight against.\n\nThe Skylab is a system used to produce and refine ores, such as Prometium, Endurium, and Terbium. These basic ores can be refined to Prometid and Duranium, which when combined with Xenomit can make Promerium. There is also a crystal named Seprom that can only be produced in the Skylab by further refining Promerium. Seprom cannot be sold however the ore can give weapons and shields a great power boost. These ores can then be sent to the player's ship and either sold for credits or equipped to enhance the ship. The highest level is 20 for upgrading your Skylab.\n\nThe Pilot Bio is a very powerful skill tree designed to give players extra advantages in-game. Pilot points are needed to work the Pilot Bio. Pilot Points can be obtained by buying log disks from the shop, shooting down boss or uber NPC's for a small chance, or even by completing Galaxy Gates. Each pilot point can be used to acquire certain abilities that help the player in battle or other game functions. A player can have up to fifty pilot points in their bio. When certain skills are maxed out, they generate special effects, such as brighter lasers, rocket trails, etc.\nMost pilot points a player can spend is 50.\n\nFor 100 Uridium or from Palladium, a resource which is converted into extra energy, players can \"spin\" a galaxy Gate Generator, which gives ammunition, free repairs, or parts for a \"galaxy gate\". Once you collect enough parts to build one of the many galaxy gates, you are sent through a portal into a map where enemies cannot reach you, only NPCs. Once in, the only way out is to be shot down, or to destroy the entire \"wave\" of aliens. These waves get progressively harder throughout the duration of the gate; they also become more difficult depending on the gate you have active. The reward for completing a gate without being shot down more than twice is quite substantial.\n\nAlso called the Outfit Gate, the Lord of War map is found on every x-3 map. To enter this gate, one must be in an outfit. Once in the gate, players find there is no way out - they must \"finish\" the gate. The goal is to energize four probes at the corners of the map; once this is accomplished, the station at the center of the map gains the ability to heal any player that goes within range. In addition, a considerable horde of aliens spawns, along with the Century Falcon. Killing this extremely tough NPC awards the player the achievement \"Falconer\" and ejects them from the map. All destructions inside the map result in free repairs.\n\nDarkOrbit has special events from time to time that can give players special rewards.\n\nJackpot Arena is a monthly event on the second Sunday of every month, in which all players who sign up fight each other in 1 vs 1 until only one ship is left surviving. The winning player will receive real cash up to €10,000. from DarkOrbit, based on how many \"Jackpot euros\" they had. Jackpot dollars can be found in bonus boxes that are scattered across space.\n\nThe Jackpot Arena has been suspended permanently. There are plans on re-introducing the Jackpot Arena, however it will not contain real-life prices.\nThe Team Death Match is an event that in which five ships from one company work together to kill five ships from an enemy company. The winning team receives rewards at the end and is taken to the next level. This keeps on continuing until you die (or your team loses).\n\nSpaceball is an event that takes place in the map 4-4, with the objective of scoring goals by shooting an NPC ball to your x-5 portal. After a goal has been scored cargo boxes are released around the portal containing assorted prizes such as uridium, ammunition, and jackpot dollars. The winning company wins prizes for 24 hours the next day such as x%EP, honor, bonus box rewards, and cargo selling price.\n\nA event that is taken place in different maps, depending on your level. This event is made up of waves, each wave harder to pass than the one before. This event lets you rack up millions of credits and thousands of uridium. Repairs are free as long as you die in the invasion map.\n\nFor levels 5-9 an invasion gate appears in the middle of x-1, in x-3 a gate appears for all those between levels 10-14 and in x-5 all players at levels 15 and above have to enter invasion here. The gate in x-1 typically contains NPCs that are easier to kill and they get harder as you move to the higher gates. You are unable to log out when in the invasion gate, the only way out is if your ship is destroyed, or you level beyond the parameters of the gate.\n\nCapture The Beacon, like the traditional game capture the flag, is an event where all 3 companies have beacons in their x-2 maps which must be protected by the defending company, and captured by the attacking company, and taken back to their own x-2 map.\nGames are 1 hour long, company with most points gets a 1-hour prize such as x% more experience, honor, bonus box rewards, etc.\n\nPlayers fight in PvP battles to gain points. You gain more points based on your combo, which rises as you kill other enemy players. The top 50 in points at the end will win various prizes such as UCB-100, PLD-8, Special Mines, and even Uridium. You lose a life every time you die from an original total of 5. Once all of your lives are depleted you are eliminated and can no longer earn more points (you are also not worth any for enemy players that destroy you)\n\nNPCs will spawn every 10 minutes. The objective is to destroy all NPCs to earn a point for your company. The NPCs have camouflage and are marked as yellow on the minimap. Every map, except x-1, have varying amounts of NPCs, and once they are all destroyed there will be a message to all players on the map saying all the Infiltrators have been destroyed.\n\nTo commemorate the date that DarkOrbit went online, every year on December 11, a gate appears on the home map, given free to all players. Weakened aliens, usually at half-strength, are found in the gate. The rewards are not as large as other gates, since the enemies are weaker.\nThey also give you 35.000 uridium.\n\nThe official DarkOrbit forums are powered by vBulletin. The forums provide a place for DarkOrbit to announce updates and events as well as a place for players to ask questions, discuss the game, and give suggestions. In addition, DarkOrbit's support can be contacted via email by players wishing to report a bug or make a complaint.\n\nJoystiq called it an \"insane shooter\" with a mix of Asteroids and EVE Online.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2881735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2881735", "title": "Dark cabaret", "text": "Dark cabaret\n\nDark cabaret may be a simple description of the theme and mood of a cabaret performance, but more recently has come to define a particular musical genre which draws on the aesthetics of the decadent, risqué German Weimar-era cabarets, burlesque and vaudeville shows with the stylings of post-1970s goth and punk music.\n\nCabaret proper had long associations with counter-culture and dealt with disturbing themes, as exemplified by \"The Threepenny Opera\" by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, with one of its best known songs \"Mack the Knife\" (\"Moritat von Mackie Messer\") which tells the story of a murderous anti-hero, or the 1933 song \"Gloomy Sunday\" (\"Szomorú Vasárnap\") by Hungarian composer Rezső Seress with the more recent urban legends which have grown up around it. It was therefore natural that later artists drew upon it for inspiration: Nico's 1974 album \"The End...\" is an early example of such influence, especially in songs such as \"You Forgot to Answer\" and \"Secret Side\", while influenced artists associated with goth and punk music specifically include Nina Hagen, Sex Gang Children and The Virgin Prunes.\n\nOne of the earliest bands to play mainly or exclusively in a style which might now be described as dark cabaret were the Tiger Lillies, formed in London in 1989. In the 1980s satirical cabaret had been revived and popularised by London-based bands such as Fascinating Aïda and Kit and The Widow but the Tiger Lillies incorporated themes of blasphemy, prostitution and bestiality in their songs, sung by Martyn Jacques in a menacing style with a falsetto voice. A collaboration between Rozz Williams and Gitane Demone - both former members of Christian Death - entitled \"Dream Home Heartache\" after a song by Roxy Music, was recorded in the Netherlands and released in the United States in 1995 and was described by reviewers as \"cabaret \"noir\"\" or \"glam cabaret\". Following her 1996 debut solo album \"Quintessentially Unreal\", San Francisco-based singer/pianist Jill Tracy released her second CD, \"Diabolical Streak\", in 1999. Canada's \"Shift\" magazine called the album one of the \"Top 10 Neo-Cabaret albums of all time.\"\n\nThe term \"dark cabaret\" appears to have become popularized with the release of a 2005 compilation album entitled \"Projekt Presents: A Dark Cabaret\" by Projekt Records, a label chiefly associated with the dark wave genre. The album included \"Flowers\" from \"Dream Home Heartache\" sung by Rozz Williams together with, among others, \"Evil Night Together\" by Jill Tracy, \"Sometimes, Sunshine\" by Revue Noir, and \"Coin-Operated Boy\" by The Dresden Dolls. Formed by Amanda Palmer and Brian Viglione in 2000, The Dresden Dolls described their music as \"Brechtian punk cabaret\", a term coined by Amanda Palmer in early 2003 in part to preclude being labelled by the media as goths. Nevertheless, with their musical style and appearance in white face makeup and reduced period clothing, The Dresden Dolls and their fans quickly became the most readily identified with the newly evident dark cabaret genre, garnering the most mainstream attention. Subsequently, bands began categorising themselves and their performance as dark cabaret, such as San Diego's The Tragic Tantrum in the US, Katzenjammer Kabarett in France, or Ray Childish in Graz, Austria.\n\nNew sects of dark cabaret have emerged from the previous theatrical dark cabaret. With a more aggressive side and a punk or metal background, with some bands also closely associated with the punk cabaret subgenre, for example: Stolen Babies or Harlequin Jones.\n\nThe appearance of an identifiable dark cabaret scene coincided with the rise of Neo-Burlesque starting in the 1990s. The two have become linked following the appearance of performers such as the Chicago burlesque orchestra \"Apartment\" (1997–2005) and the emergence of gothic bellydance. Collaboration with burlesque performers was given by Brian Viglione as the inspiration for The Dresden Dolls' look.\n\n\n"}

Three years later he starred as the female parrot \"Rosalinda\" in the popular movie \"Pippi in the South Seas\". Douglas is capable of singing and of speaking a few dozen words. In 2002, 32 years after the movie, Douglas garnered a lot of attention in the Swedish press, when the authorities were considering to put him to death due to its owner at the time not having the proper paperwork. A petition pleading for Douglas' life comprised over 50,000 signatures including one by the actress Inger Nilsson, who played Pippi in the 1970 movie. Ultimately Douglas was spared after its first owner in Sweden produced the proper paper work, showing that he was legally imported from Brazil in 1967.\n\nIn 2005 Douglas moved to a small zoo in Malmö, where he lived together with a female blue-and-yellow macaw called \"Gojan\" until 2016. Early in 2016 Douglas once more attracted the attention of the Swedish media and later of the German one as well. Swedish authorities had again plans to put Douglas to death due to its cage of 3 m being too small and not allowing him to fly. The authorities requested an aviary of at least 30 m, which the zoo couldn't provide. The zoo's director Frank Madsen tried to get an exception arguing that due to its very old age Douglas was incapable of flying anyhow and that it made no sense to cut short his remaining final years. As the authorities were unwilling to grant an exception, Madsen turned to the press and received soon over 100 offers for a new home for Douglas and Gojan. Ultimately the Karlsruhe Zoo in Germany was selected and in April Madsen himself delivered Douglas and Gojan to Karlsruhe, where they were greeted with a public welcome party.\n\nFive months later in September 2016 Gojan died at an age of 45 and the zoo is planning to pair Douglas with another macaw.\n\n"}

His multicultural group of friends consisted of Nestor Best (Ardon Bess), Max (John J. Dee), and Tony \"Duke\" Zarro (Bob Vinci), who hung around regularly to the perennial disapproval of King's mother Gladys (Helene Winston).\n\nFor the first three seasons, Fiona Reid played his wife Cathy. At the end of the third season, Reid decided to leave the series, so Larry and Cathy divorced. Larry then pursued other relationships, most notably with Gwen Twining (Jayne Eastwood) in the final season.\n\nThe show was created by Perry Rosemond, who also produced the first season. Other producers included Jack Humphrey (1976–1980) and Joe Partington (1978–1980). The series featured many Canadian actors as guest stars, including Mike Myers, John Candy, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas, Jeff Wincott and Mark Humphrey. The show was popular with viewers; prior to the start of the fourth season, one of the producers noted the show drew 1.5 to 1.8 million viewers weekly.\n\nThe show's gentle but politically conscious humour is seen by some critics as a Canadian version of the topical Norman Lear sitcoms of the 1970s, such as \"All in the Family\" and \"Maude\". The series was syndicated to some American stations during the height of its popularity, including WTTG in Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter \"King of Kensington\" ended in 1980, many of the producers went on to create the new CBC sitcom \"Hangin' In\", while head writer Louis Del Grande went on to create and star in \"Seeing Things\", and Waxman was cast in the American series \"Cagney & Lacey\".\n\n\nIn the \"SCTV\" episode \"CCCP1-Russian television\", one of the fake TV programs infiltrating the network is \"Hey Giorgiy\", about \"everyone's favorite Cossack\", intended as a Russian knockoff of \"King of Kensington\".\n\nIn the first episode of the 1990s television series \"Twitch City\", also set in Kensington, the character Nathan (played by Daniel MacIvor) was sent to prison for killing a homeless man with a can of cat food. The producers of \"Twitch City\" cast Al Waxman in the role of the murder victim, as a symbolic wink to \"King of Kensington\", although they claimed that they did not intend for the character to be seen as Larry King himself.\n\nIn the late 1990s, \"This Hour Has 22 Minutes\" featured a sketch detailing the making of a film version of \"King of Kensington.\" In the sketch, director Atom Egoyan (played by Greg Thomey), re-imagines the series as a surreal crime thriller, with Larry King as a serial killer instead of a convenience store owner. \n\nFollowing Waxman's death on January 18, 2001, a memorial to him was erected in Kensington Market.\n\nIn one episode of the Canadian comedy program \"Puppets Who Kill\", the character Bill steals Al Waxman's preserved brain from CBC headquarters.\n\nOn November 13, 2007, Morningstar Entertainment released \"King of Kensington – Season One\" on DVD in Region 1.\n\n"}

This was the final episode to be written by series co-creator Jeri Taylor.\n\n\"Voyager\" encounters an energy wave that turns out to be a distress call from a nearby ship. Arriving to help, they find the ship contains only one non-humanoid life form on the verge of dying. They transport the scorpion-like creature to Sickbay, and The Doctor begins to try to treat it. B'Elanna Torres, having learned of how the creature interacts with its ship, arrives to provide advice, but suddenly the creature leaps at her. It wraps itself around her, piercing her neck and other vital organs, creating a physical and biochemical bond between them. The Doctor finds that attempting to pull the creature off will likely kill Torres, and seeks another solution. When he exhausts his own knowledge, he searches through the \"Voyager\" databanks and discovers information on the brilliant Cardassian exobiologist Crell Moset. The Doctor programs the holodeck to recreate Moset as to work out the solution for separating the creature from Torres together, and they develop a rapport with each other. Moset finds a method that they could separate the creature, likely killing it while leaving Torres alive, but the Doctor would rather save both patients.\n\nWord of the Doctor's simulation spreads about the ship. Tabor, a Bajoran ensign, accosts the Doctor, telling him that the real Moset had indiscriminately experimented on hundreds of Bajoran lives during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor, even though these ended up with beneficial treatments, and threatens to resign if Moset's program is allowed to continue. Torres, barely alive, also learns of Moset, and as a former Maquis member that was sympathetic to Bajor's cause, refuses to accept any procedure developed by the simulation. Moset does come across a procedure that should safely separate the creature from Torres without harming either, and after much deliberation with the senior staff, Captain Janeway orders the Doctor to proceed, overriding Torres' refusal.\n\nThe Doctor and Moset start the operation in the holodeck, which involves applying a high frequency pulse to the creature's primary neo-cortex to weaken its motor controls. Initially this appears to work but as the operation continues, the effect of the pulse weakens, and Moset insists on increasing the frequency to make it more potent but potentially damaging the creature's synapses, but the Doctor orders him to stop, and instead applies the pulse to the secondary neo-cortex.\n\nDuring the operation, a ship similar in design to the creature arrives, and it attempts to communicate with \"Voyager\", but this only comes out as a series of high-pitched shrieks. \"Voyager\" is unable to provide a comprehensible reply, and the new ship grabs \"Voyager\" in a power-draining tractor beam. Though her senior staff suggest using weapons to disable the new ship, Janeway holds firm onto arriving at a peaceful solution. First Officer Chakotay reroutes power to the holodeck to assure the Doctor can complete the operation with Moset. Eventually, the Doctor's treatment works, and they are able to stabilize both Torres and the creature. Janeway has the creature transported back aboard the new ship. It disengages the tractor beam and flies off.\n\nJaneway poses the question to the Doctor of whether they should retain the Moset program, as though his xenobiology knowledge would be of tremendous help, his presence has upset part of the crew; Torres herself is furious at Janeway for overriding her refusal even though it saved her life. The Doctor talks to Moset privately, and comes to learn Moset considers his Machiavellian methods necessary for \"Voyager\"s survival, and that itself requires them to experiment on \"lower\" animals for the greater good. The Doctor wavers, and Moset tries to plead with him, pointing out that the Doctor himself has not lived up to the Hippocratic Oath by utilizing all available resources to save a life. The Doctor is not moved by Moset's argument and orders the program terminated and deleted from the computer, explaining he cannot in good conscience use Moset's knowledge knowing how it was obtained.\n\n\n"}

The first production by Star Film, it was produced by Jo Eng Sek and featured camerawork by Cho' Chin Hsin. Starring L. V. Wijnhamer, Jr., Elly Joenara, and Mohamad Arief, it followed the social worker Pah Wongso as he investigated a murder to clear his protégé's name.\n\nThe first film of its genre to be produced in the Indies, \"Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman\" was made to capitalize on the popularity of Wijnhamer and Hollywood characters such as Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto. Released in April 1941 to popular acclaim, it had a mixed critical reception; the reviewer Saeroen suggested that its success was entirely because of its star's renown. A sequel to this film, which is possibly lost, \"Pah Wongso Tersangka\", was released later that year.\n\nPah Wongso is a nut seller, social worker, and schoolmaster who lives in Batavia and takes care of the local poor. One day, his young protégé Wisnoe saves the life of a young woman named Siti when she is almost hit by a carriage. In thanks, her father Haji Abdullah gives Wisnoe a job at his rice mill. Wisnoe's zeal and diligence quickly make him stand out from his fellow employees, and he begins to woo Siti, who returns his affections.\n\nHowever, Wisnoe's cousin Bardja is envious of his newfound success. A gambler who frequents prostitutes, Bardja is smitten with Siti, who does not love him. Hoping to eliminate his competition, Bardja hires some thugs to kill Wisnoe; this attempt fails, and Bardja's financial situation becomes increasingly desperate. He decides to steal from his rich uncle, but is caught in the act. In the ensuing struggle, he kills the older man, then frames Wisnoe for the murder.\n\nWisnoe is arrested, and soon Pah Wongso – warned by Siti of Bardja's previous treachery – begins to investigate the case. Ultimately he discovers that Bardja is the true murderer and confronts him, resulting in a battle to the death. Wongso emerges victorious, and Wisnoe's name is cleared.\n\n\"Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman\" was produced by Jo Eng Sek, a businessman who had produced the film \"Si Tjonat\" in 1929. Cinematography on this black-and-white film was handled by Cho' Chin Hsin, who had recently immigrated from Shanghai. The film was the first production of Star Film, a studio which Jo and Cho' had established in Prinsenland, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, Jakarta).\n\nAt the time, the Hollywood characters Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto were popular in the Indies, as were imported detective films in general; however, no films in that genre had yet been produced domestically. This led Jo to make a detective film which he thought would be successful with ethnic Chinese audiences. For this, he approached L. V. Wijnhamer, Jr., an Indo man who was popular within the ethnic Chinese community for his social work; Wijnhamer, better known as Pah Wongso, helped educate abandoned children, ran an employment office, and raised funds for Red Cross aid in war-torn China. Wijnhamer accepted the role.\n\nTo support Wongso, stage actress Elly Joenara was cast as Siti, making her film debut, while Mohamad Arief appeared as Wisnu. Other cast members included Djoenaedi, R. Sukran, and Miss Satijem. To ensure that fight scenes went smoothly, Jo hired members of Primo Oesman's \"silat\" and boxing group to perform as criminals; Oesman, a professional boxer, also appeared in the film.\n\n\"Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman\" was rated for audiences over the age of 17. It premiered at the Rex Theatre in Batavia on 1 April 1941, following a short speech by Wijnhamer. It had reached Surabaya by June, where it was advertised as a film of intrigue, life, and death. Although intended predominantly for domestic consumption, it was also screened in China, Singapore and British Malaya. When the film reached Singapore in July 1941, it was touted as a \"thrilling Malay detective story ... full of thrills and excitement from beginning to end\".\n\nThe Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran records \"Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman\" as a commercial success. Critical reviews, however, were mixed. An anonymous reviewer in the \"Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad\" praised the quality of the film, particularly its cinematography, acting, and story. In the Malayan magazine \"Film Melayu\", a reviewer considered the film of similar quality to Hollywood productions and praised its casting of a South East Asian as the titular detective. The critic and filmwriter Saeroen expressed concern that the film's success was not because of its quality, and opined that it was only popular because of Wijnhamer's fame.\n\nBy September 1941, Jo had begun production of a second – and final – film starring Wongso, titled \"Pah Wongso Tersangka\" (\"Pah Wongso Becomes a Suspect\"). Directed by Wu Tsun, this late 1941 release featured Pah Wongso in four roles and showed him attempting to clear his name after being framed for a crime. Arief, Primo, and Sukran were also recast in this film, which was billed as the colony's first comedy film. Although Joenara did not return for \"Pah Wongso Tersangka\", she acted in three further films for Star; her acting career continued into the 1950s, and she became a producer in the early 1970s.\n\n\"Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman\" may be lost. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. Thus, the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider wrote that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" (\"Indonesian Film Catalogue\") records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.\n"}
{"id": "21517214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21517214", "title": "Pet psychic", "text": "Pet psychic\n\nA pet psychic is a person who claims to communicate by psychic means with animals, either living or dead. The term psychic refers to the claimed ability to perceive information unavailable to the normal senses by what is claimed to be extrasensory perception. It is the opinion of scientific skeptics that people believe in such abilities due to cognitive biases and the use of various techniques by the practitioners, including intentional deception.\n\nPet psychics rely on different techniques when doing an animal \"reading\". These psychics allegedly communicate with animals and connect with an animal's spirit. Some claim that the readings are done by communicating with their electromagnetic energy, similar to reiki and/or therapeutic touch healing. Others claim the animal does not need to be alive or physically close to the psychic, as phone readings are sometimes done.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the Association for Research and Enlightenment began researching paranormal and psychic abilities in humans. The first animal communicators claimed they could communicate telepathically with animals living or dead.\n\nA pet psychic is different from \"pet whisperers\", such as Cesar Millan or Monty Roberts, who use body language and a claimed understanding of animal psychology to \"communicate\" with animals.\n\nSkeptical investigator Joe Nickell reported on this topic in the Skeptical Inquirer in 2002. He reported that cold reading can explain why so many pet psychics appear to communicate with animals. Pet psychics like Gerri Leigh and Animal Planet's Sonya Fitzpatrick work in front of audiences with the pets and owners present at the same time. Although appearing to be impressive, the conclusions and pronouncements are \"validated\" by the pet owners and not the pets themselves. Furthermore, linguistic professor Karen Stollznow tested a pet psychic with a cat named Jed. Not only was the psychic \"completely inaccurate in her reading of Jed's age, place of birth, background, behavior, health, and my health ...\", she was unable to tell that Jed was not her cat. Stollznow concluded that \"language is human-species specific. We don't and can't 'know' what animals think.\"\n\nSkeptic Robert Todd Carroll has described the claims of pet psychics as quackery. According to Carroll \"the king of the animal quackers has to be Rupert Sheldrake, who thinks he's proved that some pets are psychic.\"\n\nSkeptical investigator Benjamin Radford wrote about this topic in 2012 and said:\nRadford also outlined a simple 3-step test that would provide proof of this claimed ability, but predicted that pet psychics would always fail such a test. He also reported that \"The problem of pet psychics taking advantage of grieving pet owners plagues people like Dr. Wally Sife, founder of The Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to providing grief counseling for people who have lost beloved animals.\" \n\nIn 2012, the hosts of the \"Oh No, Ross and Carrie!\" podcast investigated the efficacy of pet psychics and were unimpressed.\n"}

After 2012 the project was reformed as \"Playpower Labs, LLC\" which focuses now on educational games for mobile platforms.\n\nThe games are designed to run on 8-bit systems, using designs and processors that are in the public domain e.g. Famicom clones which patents have expired, which allows the games to be run on very low cost computers. For $12, families can buy a compatible computer with an 8-bit, 6502 processor, a keyboard, a slot for game cartridges, a mouse, and two game controllers. Lacking its own monitor, the computer plugs into a TV screen for display. Part of the software should be acquired as source code of abandoned educational games, like Number Munchers and Lemonade Stand, and ported by the open-source community.\n\nAt least three games were in production as of early 2010, \"Hanuman Typing warrior\", \"Hanuman's Quiz Adventure\" and the \"Mosquito game\". The project opened the source code for these three games, written in assembly. One of them teaches players how to type, which can greatly improve their earning potential in the job market. Another is a multiple choice question game, somewhat similar to that featured in the film \"Slumdog Millionaire\". And finally, a different game was created to raise awareness of malaria (which infects 1.5 million people a year in India) by allowing players to kill mosquitoes and accumulate points toward antimalarial mosquito nets.\n\nThe organization was founded in 2008 by Derek Lomas and Daniel Rehn, who were students at the University of California at San Diego at the time, and Jeremy Douglass, a post doctoral research fellow at the same school at the time.\n\nIn 2012 Daniel Rehn announced on his private homepage the PowerPlay project as \"finished\".\n\nAfter 2012 the Playpower project was transformed to \"Playpower Labs, LLC\" and offers now mobile platform educational games via Apple's Itunes store and Google's play store.\n\nPLAYPOWER won the MacArthur Foundation's Digital Media and Learning Competition in 2009, for which it received $180,000 to help fund its activities. More than 100 volunteer programmers from around the world have signed up to help develop games.\n\nThe project was noted broadly in the academic domain and by the web community like BoingBoing.\n\n\n"}

Network executives may decide to attempt to revive a television program when they feel that a market once again exists for it. It is one of several programming strategies television networks employ to capitalize further on successful programs; among the other methods are spin-offs, reboots, remakes, cast reunions, and television movies.\n\nUnlike spin-offs, in which a television network creates an entirely new series around an existing character, a revival reintroduces most or many of the original program's storylines, characters, and locales. Revivals usually take place at some point after the original series ends. By contrast, reboots and remakes may feature many of the original characters, but are usually played by new cast members and without taking into account events or continuity that occurred during the original series.\n\nLegend: \"—\" = denotes shared name with original work.\n\n"}

Described by John Betjeman as \"this decent man from the suburbs\", Stone is one of Humphries' more enduring characters.\n\nThe inspiration for Sandy came from a neighbour, a Mr Whittle, whom Humphries knew as a boy, and was portrayed in a short story, \"Sandy Stone's Big Week\", written by Humphries (under the pseudonym H. Grahame) in 1956 but not published until 1958 (in a Canberra student magazine \"Prometheus\"). Humphries describes Sandy, originally called Dusty, as an \"elderly, childless man\" living in the suburbs of Melbourne. His vocal mannerisms came from an old codger Humphries met on Bondi Beach.\n\nOne of Sandy's monologues was part of the recording \"A Nice Night's Entertainment\", which was particularly enjoyed by Humphries' friend, Peter Cook. Humphries is still writing monologues for Sandy Stone \"Australia’s most boring man\". He said in 2016 that \"slowly the character has deepened, so I begin to understand and appreciate him, and finally feel myself turning into him\". He no longer requires makeup for the part, and plays Sandy in his own dressing gown. \n\nSandy's monologues were sometimes inspired by stories recounted to Humphries by friends or family, like the tale of Dot Swift who was handed over to the Twilight Home which may be the very same home, or perhaps a subsidiary of the one Dame Edna's mother resides in. Barry Humphries sometimes used the character to balance pathos with humor or satire: in one monologue having the ghost of Sandy Stone recall his four-year-old daughter who died in the 1930s and how his wife then suffered a breakdown. The Australian columnist Peter Craven commented that Humphries in his Sandy Stone persona could \"reduce an audience of young unbelieving cynics to tears with material that might have been written by James Joyce - delivered with wan, uncomprehending wonderment\".\n\nThe character is featured in the track \"Sandy Agonistes\" on Humphries' comedy recording \"Moonee Ponds Muse, Vol. 1\"\n\nThe complete scripts (edited by Colin O'Brien) of all the Stone soliloquies were published in \"The Life and Death of Sandy Stone\" in 1990.\n\nThe artist Sidney Nolan painted a portrait of the character.\n"}

The comic was set in a fictional funny animal setting, depicting attempts by its title character, Squeak the Mouse, to outwit a cat who is chasing him. The comic satirizes cartoon series such as \"Tom and Jerry\", taking the content to extreme levels, which includes gory horror violence and explicit sexual content.\n\nTwo issues of a \"Squeak the Mouse\" comic book were produced in 1986 and 1992, the first written from the perspective of the cat, who murders the title character, and the second, written from the perspective of Squeak, who murders the cat. Each issue features a zombie plotline and a pornographic section depicting one of the main characters in an orgy with several funny animal women.\n\n\"Squeak the Mouse\" is a parody of the cartoon series, \"Tom and Jerry\". Although the style of the drawing is typical of children comics, \"Squeak\" indulges in graphic violent, gore, splatter and pornographic scenes.\n\nThe first issue of the series is written from the perspective of the cat, who is aggravated by Squeak the Mouse, and ultimately murders the title character. The cat goes to a party and unsuccessfully attempts to have sex with his girlfriend, and instead sleeps with another girl he meets at the party, Squeak the Mouse returns from the dead as a zombie and murders every one of the guests at the party, until the cat stops the mouse by murdering it with a blender. When the cat returns home, each of the party guests, revived as zombies, attempt to kill him, leading him to kill each of the undead in self-defense. The next day, the cat engages in an orgy with a number of beautiful women, but Squeak the Mouse returns once more and slaughters each of the women, leading the cat to kill Squeak once more before chasing after another mouse. The end of the issue assures readers that Squeak is really dead and will not return.\n\nThe second issue, \"Squeak the Mouse 2\", begins with a duck who revives Squeak from the pages of the first \"Squeak the Mouse\" comic book. Squeak proceeds to read his own comic, and is horrified by his own murder, and decides to track down the cat and murder him. However, when Squeak confronts the cat at a screening of \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\", the cat tricks Squeak into feeling sympathy for him, which allows the cat to briefly escape before being murdered by the mouse. As Squeak boards a plane heading to a tropical island, the cat returns as a zombie and crashes the plane, killing all of the passengers except Squeak, who escapes, and swims to the nearest island, where a pair of women awaken him by performing oral sex on Squeak, leading to another orgy sequence. The cat turns up on the island and slaughters the women, and Squeak destroys the cat, leaving only its separated bones, which are found by a horror film-loving child, who brings the remains home and reassembles them. The skeleton cat slaughters the child and his family, and once again goes after Squeak, who finally gets rid of the cat for good, but decides to antagonize another cat.\n\nThe comic was first published in the underground comics magazine \"Frigidaire\" starting from 1982. The stories were later collected in an eponymous volume in 1984; initially intended to be an ended series, it had a sequel (\"Squeak the Mouse 2\") published in 1992.\n\nOn August 1, 1985, New York harbor officials confiscated the comic publication on the grounds that it was pornographic, but a court later overturned that decision. According to Bernd Metz of Catalan Communications, the book's USA publisher, \"Squeak the Mouse\" was ruled not obscene \"because it failed the third test of the law... the Miller test as it's called... in that it did not exceed the community standards.\"\n\nThe comics are considered to be an apparent inspiration for Matt Groening's \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\".\n"}

Famous for his gravelly voice, he credited it for his success, saying, \"It's kept meat and potatoes on the table for years for Wolfman and Wolfwoman. A couple of shots of whiskey helps it. I've got that nice raspy sound.\"\n\nSmith was born in Brooklyn on January 21, 1938, the younger of two children of Anson Weston Smith, an Episcopal Sunday school teacher, writer, editor, and executive vice president of the \"Financial World\", and his wife Rosamond Small. They lived on 12th Street and 4th Avenue in the Park Slope section. His parents divorced while he was a child. To help keep him out of trouble, his father bought him a large Trans-Oceanic radio, and Smith became an avid fan of R&B music and the disc jockeys who played it, including \"Jocko\" Henderson of Philadelphia, New York's \"Dr. Jive\" (Tommy Smalls), the \"Moon Dog\" from Cleveland, Alan Freed, and Nashville's \"John R.\" Richbourg, who later became his mentor. After selling encyclopedias and Fuller brushes door-to-door, Smith attended the National Academy of Broadcasting in Washington, D.C. After he graduated in 1960, he began working as \"Daddy Jules\" at WYOU in Newport News, Virginia. When the station format changed to \"beautiful music\", Smith became known as \"Roger Gordon and Music in Good Taste\". In 1962, he moved to country music station KCIJ/1050 in Shreveport, Louisiana, as the station manager and morning disc jockey, \"Big Smith with the Records\". He married Lucy \"Lou\" Lamb in 1961, and they had two children.\n\nDisc jockey Alan Freed had played a role in the transformation of black rhythm and blues into rock and roll music, and originally called himself the \"Moon Dog\" after New York City street musician Moondog. Freed both adopted this name and used a recorded howl to give his early broadcasts a unique character. Smith's adaptation of the Moondog theme was to call himself Wolfman Jack and add his own sound effects. The character was based in part on the manner and style of bluesman Howlin' Wolf. It was at KCIJ in Shreveport, Louisiana that he first began to develop his famous alter ego Wolfman Jack. According to author Philip A. Lieberman, Smith's \"Wolfman\" persona \"derived from Smith's love of horror films and his shenanigans as a 'wolfman' with his two young nephews. The 'Jack' was added as a part of the 'hipster' lingo of the 1950s, as in 'Take a page from my book, Jack,' or the more popular, 'Hit the road, Jack.'\"\n\nIn 1963, Smith took his act to the border when the Inter-American Radio Advertising's Ramon Bosquez hired him and sent him to the studio and transmitter site of XERF-AM at Ciudad Acuña in Mexico, a station whose high-powered border blaster signal could be picked up across much of the United States. In an interview with writer Tom Miller, Smith described the reach of the XERF signal: \"We had the most powerful signal in North America. Birds dropped dead when they flew too close to the tower. A car driving from New York to L.A. would never lose the station.\" Most of the border stations broadcast at 250,000 watts, five times the U.S. limit, meaning that their signals were picked up all over North America, and at night as far away as Europe and the Soviet Union. It was at XERF that Smith developed his signature style (with phrases like \"Who's this on the Wolfman telephone?\") and widespread fame. The border stations made money by renting time to Pentecostal preachers and psychics, and by taking 50 percent of the profit from anything sold by mail order. The Wolfman did pitches for dog food, weight-loss pills, weight-gain pills, rose bushes, and baby chicks. There was even a pill called Florex, which was supposed to enhance one's sex drive. \"Some zing for your ling nuts,\" the Wolfman would say.\n\nThat sales pitch was typical of Wolfman Jack's growling, exuberant on-air style. In the spirit of his character name, he would punctuate his banter with howls, while urging his listeners to \"get naked\" or \"lay your hands on the radio and squeeze my knobs\". Part of the persona was his nocturnal anonymity; listeners from coast to coast had no idea how to recognize the face behind the voice that said things like \"Wolfman plays the best records in the business, and then he eats 'em!\"\n\nXERB was the original call sign for the border blaster station in Rosarito Beach, Mexico, which was branded as The Mighty 1090 in Hollywood, California. The station boasted \"50,000 watts of Boss Soul Power\". That station continues to broadcast today with the call sign XEPRS-AM. XERB also had an office in the rear of a small strip mall on Third Avenue in Chula Vista, California. It was not unlike the small broadcast studio depicted in the film \"American Graffiti\" (which was filmed at KRE in Berkeley). It was located only ten minutes from the Tijuana–San Diego border crossing. It was rumored that the Wolfman actually broadcast from this location during the early-to-mid-1960s. Smith left Mexico after eight months and moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, to run station KUXL. Even though Smith was managing a Minneapolis radio station, he was still broadcasting as Wolfman Jack on XERF via taped shows that he sent to the station. Missing the excitement, however, he returned to border radio to run XERB, and opened an office on Sunset Boulevard in the Los Angeles area in January 1966. The Wolfman recorded his shows in Los Angeles and shipped his tapes across the border into Mexico, where they would then be beamed across the U.S. It was during his time broadcasting on XERB that Smith met Don Kelley, who became his personal manager and business partner for more than 20 years. It was Kelley who saw the potential for Wolfman Jack to become more than a radio personality. Kelley started to work on a strategy to transform Smith from a cult figure to a mainstream entertainer in film, recordings, and television. He promoted Smith to the major media and formed enduring relationships with key journalists.\n\nIn 1971, the Mexican government decided that its overwhelmingly Roman Catholic citizens should not be subjected to proselytizing and banned the Pentecostal preachers from the radio, taking away 80 percent of XERB's revenue. Smith then moved to station KDAY 1580 in Los Angeles, which could only pay him a fraction of his former XERB income. However, Smith capitalized on his fame by editing his old XERB tapes and selling them to radio stations everywhere, becoming one of the first rock and roll syndicated programs (as the tapes began to age, they were eventually also marketed to oldies stations). He also appeared on Armed Forces Radio from 1970 to 1986. At his peak, Wolfman Jack was heard on more than 2,000 radio stations in 53 countries. He was heard as far off as the Wild Coast, Transkei, on a station based there, Capital Radio 604. In a deal promoted by Don Kelley, The Wolfman was paid handsomely to join WNBC in New York in August 1973, the same month that \"American Graffiti\" premiered, and the station did a huge advertising campaign in local newspapers stating that the Wolfman would propel their ratings over those of their main competitor, WABC, which had \"Cousin Brucie\" (Bruce Morrow). The ads proclaimed, \"Cousin Brucie's Days Are Numbered\", and thousands of small tombstone-shaped paperweights were distributed that said, \"Cousin Brucie is going to be buried by Wolfman Jack.\" After less than a year, WNBC hired Cousin Brucie, and Wolfman Jack went back to California to concentrate on his syndicated radio show, which was carried on KRLA-Pasadena (Los Angeles) from 1984-1987. He moved to Belvidere, North Carolina, in 1989, to be closer to his extended family. In the 80s, he did a brief stint at XEROK 80, another border blaster station that was leased by Dallas investors Robert Hanna, Grady Sanders, and John Ryman. Ryman then moved Smith to Scott Ginsburg-owned Y95 in Dallas, Texas.\n\nIn the early days, Wolfman Jack made sporadic public appearances, usually as a Master of Ceremonies for rock bands at local Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance he looked a little different because Smith had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show him with a goatee; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat \"ethnic\". Other times he had a big afro wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. It was not until he appeared in the 1969 film, \"A Session with the Committee\" (a montage of skits by the seminal comedy troupe The Committee), that mainstream America got a good look at Wolfman Jack.\n\nWolfman Jack started his recording career in Minneapolis, Minnesota while working at KUXL Radio in 1965 with George Garrett. Garrett would help record the album \"Boogie With The Wolfman\" by Wolfman Jack & the Wolfpack on the Bread Label. The title tracks \"Wolfman Boogie Pt. 1/Wolfman Boogie Pt. 2\" was released as the first single and was written by Garrett and T.Caire. Garrett was also responsible for engineering, producing and assembling the band. A second single, \"New Orleans\" was also released. \n\nWolfman Jack released two albums on the Wooden Nickel label: \"Wolfman Jack\" (1972) and \"Through the Ages\" (1973). His 1972 single \"I Ain't Never Seen a White Man\" hit #106 on the Billboard Singles Charts.\n\nIn 1973, he appeared in director George Lucas's second feature film, \"American Graffiti\", as himself. His broadcasts tie the film together, and Richard Dreyfuss's character catches a glimpse of the mysterious Wolfman in a pivotal scene. In gratitude for Wolfman Jack's participation, Lucas gave him a fraction of a \"point\" — the division of the profits from a film — and the extreme financial success of \"American Graffiti\" provided him with a regular income for life. He also appeared in the film's 1979 sequel, \"More American Graffiti\", though only through voice-overs. In 1978, Wolfman Jack appeared as Bob \"The Jackal\" Smith in a made-for-TV movie \"Deadman's Curve,\" a film based on the musical careers of Jan Berry and Dean Torrence, aka Jan and Dean.\n\nSubsequently, Smith appeared in several television shows as Wolfman Jack. They included \"The Odd Couple\"; \"What's Happening!!\"; \"Vega$\"; \"Wonder Woman\"; \"Hollywood Squares\"; \"Married... with Children\"; \"Emergency!\"; and \"Galactica 1980\". He was the regular announcer and occasional host for \"The Midnight Special\" on NBC from 1973 to 1981. He was also the host of his self-titled variety series, \"The Wolfman Jack Show\", which was produced in Canada by CBC Television in 1976, and syndicated to stations in the US.\n\nHe promoted Clearasil and Olympia beer in radio and TV commercials in the 1970s. In the 1980s he promoted the \"Rebel\" Honda motorcycle in television commercials.\n\nListening to Wolfman Jack's broadcasting influenced Jim Morrison's lyrics for \"The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)\" song. He is also mentioned in the Grateful Dead song, \"Ramble On Rose\": \"Just like Crazy Otto/Just like Wolfman Jack/Sittin' plush with a royal flush/Aces back to back.\"\n\nHe also furnished his voice in The Guess Who's 1974 tribute, the top 40 hit single, \"Clap for the Wolfman\". A few years earlier, Todd Rundgren recorded a similar tribute, \"Wolfman Jack\", on the album \"Something/Anything?\"; the single version of the track includes a shouted talk-over intro by the Wolfman but on the album version Rundgren performs that part himself. Canadian band The Stampeders also released a cover of \"Hit the Road Jack\" in 1975 featuring Wolfman Jack; the storyline of the song involved a man named \"Cornelius\" calling Jack on the phone, telling him the story of how his girlfriend had thrown him out of the house, and trying to persuade Jack to let him come and stay with him (at this point, Jack ended the call). His voice is also featured in the song \"Did You Boogie (With Your Baby)\" by Flash Cadillac & the Continental Kids (Billboard HOT 100 peak #29 in October 1976) and an imitation of him is featured as a cameo in \"Don't Call Us, We'll Call You\" by Sugarloaf (Billboard HOT 100 peak #9 in March 1975). In September 1975, Wolfman Jack appeared on stage with the Stampeders (singing \"Hit the Road Jack\") as a warm-up act for the Beach Boys at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Canada and that same year he also performed \"Don't Call Us, We'll Call You\" with Sugarloaf on \"The Midnight Special\". He is mentioned in Tammy Wynette's 1978 hit \"I'd Like to See Jesus on \"The Midnight Special\"\".\n\nIn July 1974, Wolfman Jack was the MC for the Ozark Music Festival at the Missouri State Fair grounds, a huge three-day rock festival with an estimated attendance of 350,000 people, making it one of the largest music events in history.\n\nIn 1975-80, Wolfman Jack hosted Halloween Haunt at Knott's Berry Farm, which transforms itself into Knott's Scary Farm each year for Halloween. It is the most successful special event of any theme park in the country, and has often sold out.\n\n1n 1980, he portrayed himself in the 2 part episode of \"Galactica 1980\" \"The Night the Cylons Landed, Part II\" as a Radio station DJ coerced by Cylons to gain access to the station's Transmitter equipment.\n\nIn 1980, he took the small role of Reverend Billy in the cult horror comedy film \"Motel Hell\". From 1980 to 1982, Wolfman Jack voiced the intro to the cartoon \"The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang\" airing Saturday mornings on ABC. In 1984, Wolfman Jack voiced a cartoon version of himself for the short-lived DIC Entertainment cartoon \"Wolf Rock TV\" (aka \"Wolf Rock Power Hour\") airing Saturday mornings on ABC. In 1985, Wolfman Jack's voice is heard several times in the ABC made for TV Halloween movie, \"The Midnight Hour\". Jack recorded several bits for the movie and is seen at the beginning of the movie as an extra. The song \"Clap for the Wolfman\" is heard during the movie as well. In 1986, Wolfman Jack appeared as the \"High Rama Lama\" in the CBS animated special \"Garfield in Paradise\" In 1987, Wolfman Jack appeared as himself in the music video for Joe Walsh's hit single, \"The Radio Song\", which was featured on his eighth studio solo album, \"Got Any Gum?\". \n\nA clip of a 1970s radio advertisement featuring Wolfman Jack urging registration with the United States Selective Service (aka \"the draft\") is incorporated into the Depeche Mode cover of the song \"Route 66\". Those radio advertisements were extracted from half-hour radio programs that were distributed to radio stations across the country. His syndicated music radio series was sponsored by the United States Air Force, designed as a weekly program-length public service infomercial to promote the benefits of joining the Air Force. The series ran from 1971 until 1977.\n\nIn 1988, he was the host of \"Little Darlin's Rock and Roll Palace\", a rock and roll show on The Nashville Network, with two seasons recorded in Kissimee, Florida at little Darlin's Rock and Roll Palace. The third season was recorded in Nashville and Baltimore. The shows featured house band Rockin Robin backing the greatest artists of the '50s and '60s including The Coasters, Shirelles, Lou Christie, Tommy Roe, Del Shannon, and Roger McGuinn.\n\nIn 1989, he provided the narration for the US version of the arcade game \"DJ Boy\". His voice was not used in the home version of the game due to memory limitations. In 1991, \"Little Darlin's Rock and Roll Palace\" in Kissimmee, Florida renamed the club as \"Wolfman Jack's Rock and Roll Palace\". The New Year's Eve grand opening featured, Joe Walsh, Melaine, Lester Chambers, The Impressions and Rockin Robin. Wolfman Jack played himself in an episode of \"Married... with Children\" (\"Ship Happens: Part 1\") that first aired in February 1995.\n\n\"Have Mercy: Confessions of the Original Rock 'n' Roll Animal,\" Wolfman's autobiography, was published in 1995 to stellar reviews in \"The New York Times\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"Kirkus Reviews\", which said it \"Reads like a collaboration between Mark Twain and Sergio Leone...\" His co-author was Byron Laursen.\n\nIn 2012, the Estate of Wolfman Jack released a hip hop single featuring Wolfman Jack clips as the vocals.\n\nIn 2016 clips from the Wolfman Jack Radio Program were used in the \"Rob Zombie\" film \"31\".\n\nWhen the one surviving ship in what had originally been a pirate radio network of Radio Caroline North and Radio Caroline South sank in 1980, a search began to find a replacement. Because of the laws passed in the UK in 1967, it became necessary for the sales operation to be situated in the US. For a time, Don Kelley, Wolfman Jack's business partner and personal manager, acted as the West Coast agent for the planned new Radio Caroline, but the deal eventually fell apart.\n\nAs a part of this process, Wolfman Jack was set to deliver the morning shows on the new station. To that end, Wolfman Jack recorded a number of programs that never aired, because the station didn't come on air according to schedule. (It eventually returned from a new ship in 1983 which remained at sea until 1990.) Today those tapes are traded among collectors of his work.\n\nOn July 1, 1995, Smith died from a heart attack at his house in Belvidere, North Carolina, shortly after finishing a weekly broadcast. He is buried at a family cemetery in Belvidere.\n\n"}
