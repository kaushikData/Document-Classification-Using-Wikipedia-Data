His origins are uncertain, but there is some evidence that he was from Australia. He studied music in London under Julius Benedict, after which he travelled to Australia in 1876. He performed and composed, and from mid-1880 was music critic of two Melbourne papers.\n\nIn 1883 Moul returned to England, where he became managing director of the Alhambra Theatre in London. For Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee in 1897 he commissioned Arthur Sullivan's ballet \"Victoria and Merrie England\". On occasion he would compose additional music for the shows he presented at the Alhambra, and he contributed to productions at other theatres, such as the London versions of Frédéric Toulmouche's \"The Wedding Eve\" (1892) and Charles Lecocq's \"Incognita\" (also 1892). For such compositions he used the pen name \"Yvolde\". For the Alhambra, known for its popular ballets, he wrote the score of one of the most successful, \"Psyche\" (1909).\n\nMoul remained closely connected with the Alhambra for many years, holding at various times the post of managing director or chairman (and both concurrently from 1906 to 1911). He was also prominent in the campaign to secure authors' and composers' intellectual property rights. He was honoured by the French government for his efforts in this respect. During the 1890s Moul was an artists' agent for opera, drama and concerts. Among those whose careers he fostered were Landon Ronald, May Yohé and Agnes Huntington. He was also active in the early British film industry, and in 1896 directed a comedy, \"The Soldier's Courtship\".\n\nMoul died in London, leaving a widow but no children.\n"}

Common gameplay elements within the series center upon educational activities, mostly focusing around American history and culture, though other aspects such as adventure, puzzle or even action elements are occasionally interspersed in some of the games.\n\nThe first two games in the series marked American Girl's (then known as Pleasant Company) expansion into video games. They featured American Girl's historical character roster, which of the time consisted of six characters representing various periods of American history.\n\n\nBesides \"Premiere\" and \"Dress Designer\", Mattel Interactive also published Your Notebook (with help from Amelia), a software toy in the form of an interactive journal based on the \"Amelia's Notebooks\" children's book series by Marissa Moss, under the American Girl banner in 1999.

The unanimous Court found that Courts of Inherent Jurisdiction such as the Quebec Superior Court had concurrent jurisdiction to hear constitutional cases.\n\nA series of companies were involved in the production of several television shows and sold air time to sponsors. The CUPE union brought a claim against the companies to Canada Industrial Relations Board. CUPE applied to have the companies declared a single party for the purposes of a collective bargaining proceedings. The companies argued that it was impossible as some of them were not inter-provincial companies and thus were outside of federal jurisdiction.\n\nThe CLRB found that the companies were a federal undertaking and so granted CUPE's application. The companies, in turn, applied to the Quebec Superior Court for a writ of evocation. The Superior Court denied the application on grounds that they did not have jurisdiction as the Federal Court Act gave the power to hear this sort of case to the Federal Court. On appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal the court held that the Superior Court had jurisdiction and granted the writ of evocation.\n\nThe issue before the Supreme Court was whether the Superior Court had jusidction over constitutional issues.\n\nThe unanimous Court upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal. The opinion was given by Chouinard J.\n\nChouinard acknowledged the fact that the Federal Court Act gave jurisdiction to the Federal Courts on matters of federal agencies. However, the Act \"does not apply to supersede the superintending and reforming power of the Superior Court\". The federal government can create a court \"for the better administration of the laws of Canada\" as per section 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Such a court may be given exclusive power over the application of federal laws. However, s 101 does not grant the federal government authority to remove the power of superior courts to determine the constitutionality of federal laws. The government can only create concurrent jurisdiction rather than exclusive jurisdiction.\n\nIn the end Chouinard held that the companies were not engaged in matters within the federal powers by creating TV programming and so the CLRB did not have jurisdiction over the dispute. Instead the superior courts had jurisdiction. The Court affirmed the Court of Appeal's granting of the writ.\n\nThe case largely established concurrent jurisdiction between statutory courts and courts of inherent jurisdiction. However, in later decisions such the jurisdiction trilogy of \"Cuddy Chicks Ltd. v. Ontario\", Douglas College case, and the Tétreault-Gadoury case, have seemingly reversed the ruling with little mention of the case itself.\n"}

It is still popular in the Channel Islands and Bermuda, but is strictly controlled and may be played legally only on certain occasions, such as the Channel Islands' three annual agricultural shows, or Bermuda's annual Cup Match cricket game.\n\nThree special dice are used in Crown and Anchor. The dice are equal in size and shape to standard dice, but instead of one through six pips, they are marked with six symbols: crown, anchor, diamond, spade, club and heart. (The last four are the same symbols used on playing cards.)\n\nThe game is played between a player and a banker. A canvas or felt mat marked with the six symbols is used for play. The player places bets on one or more symbols. He then throws the three dice. If there is a bet on any symbol which comes up on one or more of the dice, in addition to returning the stake the banker pays the player the amount of his stake for each die showing that symbol: even money if one, 2:1 if two, and 3:1 if three. If the symbol doesn't come up, the player loses his bet.\n\nThe expected return of a $1 wager on a particular symbol is calculated as follows:\nIn total, the expected return of a $1 wager is ((+$3 × 1) + (+$2 × 15) + (+$1 × 75) + (-$1 × 125))/216, or ($3 + $30 + $75 - $125)/216, which is (-$17)/216 ≈ -$0.078704.\n\nPut another way, for every $1.00 wagered, a player can expect to receive back $0.921296.\nThus, the banker has a substantial edge. In a game at a festival or casino, the house will be banker. In a game among friends, each person serves as banker in turn.\n\nA similar version of the game is played in Nepal, called \"Langur Burja\" (). There is a similar Flemish version called \"Anker en Zon\" (\"Anchor and Sun\"), in which a sun symbol replaces the crown. The French version again uses the sun, and is called \"Ancre, Pique, et Soleil\" (\"Anchor, Spade, and Sun\"). A similar game played in China called \"Hoo Hey How\" (, Fish-Prawn-Crab in Hokkien) and Vietnam called or \"Bầu cua cá cọp\".\n\n\n\n"}

In the film, Chan plays Huo An, the commander of the Protection Squad of the Western Regions during the Han Dynasty. \"Dragon Blade\" was released in IMAX 3D on 19 February 2015, the first day of the Chinese New Year holiday period. The film was released in the United States on 4 September 2015 by Lionsgate Premiere.\n\nIn northwest China, 48 BC (50 BC on screen in the English version), a security company under Han China's current government called The Silk Road Protection Squad is committed to stopping battles and promoting the idea of peace. Huo An (Jackie Chan), the captain, successfully averts a battle between the Indians and Han Chinese. The group returns to their unnamed home city, where Huo An's gentle Uyghur wife Xiuqing (Mika Wang) serves as a schoolteacher for orphans. However, the government uncovers evidence that someone in the group is corrupt, causing the entire group to be sentenced to construction work at Wild Geese Gate, a ruined fortress. Once they arrive, the group pays respects at the shrine of a fallen Chinese general. They originally were child-slaves of Han descent, but the general had later rescued them.\n\nNot long after, Wild Geese Gate is threatened by a legion from the Roman Empire in need of water and supplies, among which is a blind boy named Publius (Jozef Waite). After a stale-mated duel between Huo An and Lucius (Cusack), the Roman general, the latter agrees not to assault the city in return for being let inside. The legion uses its superior engineering skills to speed up the construction work, an act which boosts the morale and happiness of the inhabitants, who are divided among several different ethnic groups, such as Chinese, Uyghur, and Turkic. Huo An returns the favor by sending men to assist Lucius's envoys in reaching the Parthian Empire. A celebration is later held and Huo An is made an honorary centurion.\n\nLucius reveals that he and Publius are fleeing from Publius's brother Tiberius (Brody), a corrupt soldier who murdered their father, a Roman consul, and blinded Publius so Tiberius could become consul. As Tiberius approaches with 100,000 soldiers, Huo An insists on helping Lucius, pointing out that Tiberius is a threat to the Silk Road in its entirety. Shortly after Huo An leaves to find reinforcements, the corrupt group member from earlier sends Chinese soldiers to murder Xiuqing and attack Wild Geese Gate. The legion is imprisoned in the non-Chinese trading city of Kroran, where Tiberius has chosen to camp. Tiberius proceeds to murder Publius.\n\nHuo An and the few loyal Chinese soldiers travel to Kroran, pretending to surrender, but once they are inside, they destroy the Roman legion's cages. Huo An breaks into Lucius's special solitary cell, but is unable to free him. A fire breaks out, whereupon Lucius calls out to Huo An to 'take me home', and Huo An shoots an arrow to kill Lucius before the fire gets him. As Huo An's and Lucius's soldiers are surrounded, the armies of several other nations arrive and fight against Tiberius, including the Indians, Han, Uyghurs, and Turkics, all of whom are determined to preserve the Silk Road's safety. However, even their combined forces are unable to gain the upper hand. Finally, the envoys from earlier return with a massive host of Parthians, who had signed a special treaty with Publius's father and who intend to avenge his memory. Tiberius's soldiers lose their will to fight. Huo An challenges Tiberius to a duel and kills him.\n\nUpon hearing about the bravery of Lucius's legion, the Chinese emperor grants them the right to establish their own city, which they choose to name Regum. They accept Huo An as their commander, and Huo An, in turn, honors the deceased Chinese general by relocating the shrine to that city. As the centuries go on, the city fades from collective memory. However, in the modern day, a team of Asian American archaeologists stumble upon the site and uncover the dual Chinese and Latin inscriptions.\n\nFor the role of the Roman general, Lucius, Australian actor Mel Gibson was initially rumored to be taking the role. During a press conference, neither Chan nor Lee confirmed Gibson's participation and Chan only said,\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Dragon Blade\" started on 15 April 2014 in Hengdian, China with some battle scenes. The cast and crew encountered difficult filming conditions due to the heat, their heavy costume and long filming hours. Two days later, a press conference for \"Dragon Blade\" was held at the Beijing International Film Festival where star Jackie Chan and director Daniel Lee attended and announced the film to be released in IMAX 3D on 19 February 2015, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year. Aside from Hengdian, production took place in Dunhuang and the Gobi Desert.\n\nThe film was shot with a budget of US$65 million. The film was financed by Sparkle Roll Media Corporation, Huayi Brothers Media Corporation, Shanghai Film Group, Home Media & Entertainment Fund, Tencent Video and the Beijing Cultural Assets Chinese Film and Television Fund. A signing ceremony for the launching of Beijing Cultural Assets Chinese Film and Television Fund also occurred there as \"Dragon Blade\" is the first film to receive an investment from the fund. International distribution of the film outside of China was handled by Golden Network Asia.\n\n\"Dragon Blade\" was a commercial success in its native country, China. It opened Thursday, February 19 in China and grossed US$18.7 million on the opening day. Through Sunday, February 22, it had a 3-day opening weekend total of US$33 million, topping the Chinese box office (US$54.8 million from Thursday - Sunday) from 132,874 screenings and 8.14 million admissions. Through its opening week it earned US$72 million. The film fell to number three the following weekend, earning US$45.9 million (down 19%). As of March 15, 2015, \"Dragon Blade\" has earned US$120 million in China alone.\n\n\"Dragon Blade\" has received mixed reception, with much of the praise directed towards its large-scale battle sequences, production design, and mixing of styles from both Hollywood and East Asian cinema. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 34% approval rating and rating average score of 4.3/10. The site's consensus reads, \"\"Dragon Blade\" is beautifully staged and choreographed, but between the battles, its talented cast is overwhelmed by a dull story and choppy editing.\"\n\n\"Variety\"s Maggie Lee applauded the film for its overall technical details and concluded it to be \"a colossal entertainment with solid technique and terrific storytelling smarts\". Clarence Tsui of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" complimented \"Dragon Blade\" for its filmmaking quality and screenplay for a primarily mainland Chinese production.\n\nIGN awarded it a score of 6 out of 10, saying \"The story is rubbish, but \"Dragon Blade\" has some cool fight scenes thanks to Jackie Chan's action direction.\" In a negative review, Gabriel Chong from MovieXclusive.com panned \"Dragon Blade\" as being \"utterly awful in every respect\", criticizing the performances of the starring cast and inconsistent changes in tone. He writes: \"Indeed, \"Dragon Blade\" is a hot mess and a spectacular misfire, not just by its star but also by its director, and if anything, further confirms that the once-promising careers of Hollywood stars John Cusack and Adrien Brody are going the way of Nicolas Cage\".\n\nIndian media gave overwhelmingly negative review on the movie. Claiming the movie to be \"a Chinese propagandist film\", \"The Hindu's\" Venky Vembu criticized the film's lack of subtle messages and disapproved of the characterizations, writing: \"I watched this film in 3D, but given the two-dimensional nature of the cardboard characters, I don't think the third D would have vastly enhanced my view experience.\" IANS also labeled the film as \"Chinese torture\", but did commend the film for its action choreography and Jackie Chan's performance as the Chinese General Huo An: \"With ample footage in action and emotional scenes, [Huo An] is one of the best characters Chan has portrayed in recent years.\"\n\n\n"}

C. Tinsdale starting in 1915, a relationship that would last many years, and would benefit him greatly. In May 1917 Brandon-Cremer became second wireless operator aboard the Steamship 'Boonah' as he headed for the UK. In August 1917 he joined the British Garrison Artillery (BGA), part of the UK Royal Horse Artillery as a gunner (serial no. 198613). It seems he never saw active service over his 18 months with the BGA, but did qualify for several medals. In press interviews later in life, Brandon-Cremer said he was \"associated\" with the R.A.F. and consequently saw service with the British North Russian Relief Force in Russia during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and took part in the evacuation of Archangel in northern Russia) in late 1919 He has stated he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, (not verified) and displayed this medal (evidence of his flying ability can be found in the short travelogue \"In and Around MacKay\" (1933), where he is seen in the cockpit flying above MacKay)\n\nUpon his BGA discharge in February 1919, Brandon-Cremer started a 15-month stint with the London YMCA as a cinematographer. Two months later, on 19 April, he married Minnie Henrietta Warren. Minnie, age 22, from London. He listed his occupation as Film Operator. It seems Minnie died the following year .\n\nIn June 1920 Brandon-Cremer went to work in South Africa for a year making short films for the South African Film Trust. On 11 July 1921 he returned to the UK aboard the RMS 'Kinfauns' from South Africa.\n\nIn August 1921, Brandon-Cremer travelled to Spain to join the Spanish Legion fighting the Moors (Rif) in North Africa, and participated in 11 battles. He was repatriated to the UK in November, giving interviews to the British press, representing himself as the only Australian (New Zealander) to join the Spanish Legion. He later claimed to have been under the command of then Capt. Francisco Franco (subsequent dictator of Spain).\n\nHis accounts of the ill treatment of British recruits to the Spanish Legion were widely reported in American, British and Australian newspapers. Upon reading such reports, his former business partner, A. C. Tinsdale started a campaign to return Brandon-Cremer to Australia. It seems that this was accomplished as Brandon-Cremer returned to Albany, Western Australia aboard the MS Euripides on 9 March 1922.\n\nWallal, Western Australia was the chosen location for a visiting US Lick Observatory party of Astronomers, led by W. W. Campbell, to view the upcoming Solar eclipse of 21 September 1922. The purpose of the expedition to view stellar transits of the Sun's disk during the eclipse to measure and verify Albert Einstein's Theory of relativity. Wallal was preferred for its isolation from man-made light sources, its propensity for clear skies and its location to gain the longest eclipse duration.\n\nBrandon-Cremer, along with his business partner C. A. Sharpe were hired to document the expedition in both still photography and moving picture film. Hundreds of images from the team are kept at the archives of the University of California, Santa Cruz (donated by the Lick Observatory), and a second source of photos are kept at the Western Australia archives in Perth. A film made by Brandon-Cremer entitled \"Astronomers and Aborigines\" was distributed globally to showcase the Eclipse of 1922.\n\nA very young Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith was the pilot of the Western Australian Airways Bristol Type 28 Coupe Tourers plane (G-AUDF) that made bi-weekly mail drops to the Astronomers during the expedition. Kingsford-Smith took Brandon-Cremer aloft to shoot aerial footage of the camp, which was later used in the film previously mentioned.\n\nDuring the 1920s Brandon-Cremer was working for Paramount Studios in Australia as a cameraman and filmmaker, he produced such films as 'Java: The Garden of the East' (only the script exists of this movie); Other films included 'Nursery Rhymes' with his father at Bronte Beach, Sydney and 'British Quality Triumphant' in 1925. A film about automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, tractors and aircraft built in Britain and transported for sale in Australia.\n\nOn 15 July 1925, Brandon-Cremer married a second time to Sara Inez Vera Bell in Queensland. Sara lost a newborn son, Anthony Brandon-Cremer on 14 March 1926, also in Queensland. The marriage dissolved shortly after.\n\nBrandon-Cremer was active in covering aviation news and filming scenes in flight. He was instrumental in covering the arrival of the Southern Cross on its journey on the first Trans-Pacific flight to Australia in 1928, piloted by his friend Charles Kingsford-Smith. Later that year while covering the arrival of the 'British Super-marines' of the Royal Air Force from London to Sydney, he and his pilot Sturt Griffith ditched into Sydney Harbour. Both men suffered minor injuries. Six months later Brandon-Cremer was the observer for Gypsy-Moth deliveries between Melbourne and Sydney. Another newspaper article mentions his participation on filming the departure of the aeroplane 'Canberra' (de Havilland Giant Moth), An aerial expedition sent out to find the missing 'Southern Cross', piloted by Kingsford-Smith, on its attempted trip from Sydney to London. Finally, Brandon-Cremer was included in a ride along on the Vellore aeroplane journey from London to Sydney.\nBrandon-Cremer worked for the newsreel producers Cinesound during the 1930s.\n\nCinesound was a competitor to Movietone News. The Cinesound studio was based in Bondi Junction, Sydney.\n\nThe Cinesound cadre of cinematographers included Bill Carty, Joe Stafford, Arthur Smith, Bert Cross, Frank Bagnell, Clive Cross, Frank Coffey, George Heath, Frank Hurley, Stan Murdoch, Bill Shepherd and George Malcolm.\n\nThe gold prospector Lewis Harold Bell Lasseter had become famous by telling the story of his outback survival and discovery of a massive reef of surface gold near Uluru, Northern Territory. Members of the Sydney Stock Exchange organised the 'Central Australian Gold Exploration' Company (CAGE) to venture outback and rediscover this find. Camel trains and aircraft were sent out to scour the surrounds. One night during the expedition, Lasseter on camelback disappeared into the dark. After a futile search the party returned to Sydney.\n\nA second Expedition was organised called CAGE-II. In August 1931, while working for Cinesound, 'Bud' signed-on with the Central Australian Gold Exploration Company (CAGE-II) to produce all the photography and a documentary film for a search party expedition to attempt to find Lasseter and his fabled reef of gold. The party to be led by local Bob Buck, a close friend of Brandon-Cremer.\n\nThe party left Alice Springs on Camel back en route to Uluru and the Western Ranges. A few hundred kilometres west of Uluru they discovered a tree with inscriptions and directions, left by Lasseter, to a river and cave. Upon digging a short while, Buck and Brandon-Cremer discovered the bones of Harold Lasseter, and his diary. A subsequent search did not find the fabled reef of gold. The story has become Australian folklore and some still believe the reef of gold exists.\n\nSome of Brandon-Cremer's photos were later published in the chronicle of Lasseter's Last Ride by Ion L. Idriess. The Mitchell Library in Sydney retains some of the photos taken during the expedition.\n\nPrior to the CAGE-II Expedition as it was called, 'Bud' was credited in the \"Sydney Sunday Guardian\", in August 1931 – \"Mr. Ernest Brandon-Cremer is the photographer. A complete moving picture record of the expedition's activities is to be taken by Mr. Cremer, who comes from Hollywood.\" He was also referenced for this Lasseter connection in the Horden House \"Encyclopedia of Exploration\".\n\n"}

The first sound animated character was created in 1936. The first feature-length animated character appeared in 1967. Dooly the Little Dinosaur revolutionized the character market in 1987. As animation characters specific to Korea appeared, the Korean character market continued to grow. Since then, Korean character franchises have even exported their characters to other countries.\n\n \nHan Chang-Wan, a professor at Sejong University, published the history of animation character design in Korea at the Character Licensing Fair 2016. This study became the first to have rabbit and turtle illustrations as Korean animated characters. This was revealed in 'The Independent' newspaper.\n\nAccording to records, the first sound animated character was 'Gaekkum' (개꿈), who was created in 1936. This first feature-length animated character appeared in 1967, in the namesake movie about a character named Hong Gildong (홍길동).\n\nWith American and Japanese characters dominating the Korean animation industry until the 1970s, it wasn't until 1983 when Dooly the Little Dinosaur (아기 공룡 둘리) appeared in Bomulsum—a monthly magazine for kids—and changed the Korean character market. In 1987, Dooly the Little Dinosaur first aired as a six-part TV show, with another seven parts airing in 1988. In 1995, Kim Soo-jung, its creator, established a company named 'Dooly World' and went into the character design industry. The following year, the animated movie 'Dooly the Little Dinosaur' was released. In the 30 years since Dooly the Little Dinosaur launched, its related market generated 2–3 billion won per year (about 1.7–2.7 million dollars as of July 2018). This paved the way for the character market in Korea.\n\nIn 2003, Pororo the Little Penguin (뽀롱뽀롱 뽀로로) aired on EBS and became the new representation of Korean animation characters. Pororo aired in 127 countries around the world and was the first domestic animation to make a contract with Walt Disney Animation Studios directly. It was estimated that its brand value was worth 850 billion won (about 750 million dollars) and its economic impact amounted to 5.7 trillion won (about 5 billion dollars) in 2013. \n\nCurrently, many other domestic Korean animations have gained popularity, such as Tobot (변신자동차 또봇), Larva (TV series) (라바), and Tayo the Little Bus (꼬마버스 타요).\n\nThe animated Larva (TV series) (라바) recorded 10 billion won (about 9 million dollars) in sales in 2013.

He also praised the choice of pundits, highlighting that even the most recognisable of names, such as Jonathan Ross and Peter Serafinowicz, were included because they had a clear love of games and not for their celebrity appeal. Whitehead concluded that the show was a success, fun and informative, but also hampered by the format - having to cover the entirety of video gaming history in one show to an unfamiliar audience, a symptom of the lack of video games representation on television.\n\nKeith Stuart, who appeared on the show, reflected on its merits in a column for \"The Guardian\". Stuart described how ending the show with Twitter was a clever way of showing how gamification has infiltrated everyday lives, with social networks relying on the same reward systems as video games. Stuart liked how the show featured games like \"Papers, Please\", a game that explores guilt and the nature of evil, which helped to remove misconceptions that video games are incapable of exploring real-world issues. Like Whitehead, Stuart concluded with a lament over the lack of video games coverage on television, criticising broadcasters for \"ceding responsibility to YouTubers and specialist online documentary makers\" and for \"failing their audiences\". Sam Wollaston, also writing for \"The Guardian\", gave a mixed review and was critical of the talking heads format. Wollaston commented that despite containing interesting ideas, the show was overly long. For gamers however, Wollaston wrote that the show \"would have been pretty much heaven\".\n\n"}
{"id": "24199303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24199303", "title": "Jynx", "text": "Jynx\n\nJynx, known in Japan as , is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's \"Pokémon\" franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Jynx first appeared in the video games \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\" and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles, or animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. The character is voiced in Japanese by Mayumi Tanaka and by Rachael Lillis in English.\n\nJynx's design and humanoid appearance has been heavily criticized by the Western media, most notably by cultural critic Carole Boston Weatherford, who described Jynx as representing blackface after seeing the character's depiction in the anime. Due to complaints, Game Freak modified its appearance by changing the original color of its face from black to the current color, purple.\n\nJynx was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of \"Pocket Monsters\" games \"Red\" and \"Green\", which were localized outside Japan as \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\". Originally called \"Rujura\" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species \"clever and descriptive names\" related to their appearance or features, when translating the game for western audiences, as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. As a result, they were renamed \"Jynx\", a play on the word \"jinx\".\n\nAlso known as the \"Human Shape\" Pokémon, Jynx is a female-only species that resembles the Japanese mythical creatures Yamauba and Yuki-onna. Originally portrayed with a black face and hands, Jynx's design was changed to purple coloration after critiques that it perpetuated racism. In addition Jynx have large pink lips, saucer-like eyes, white arms, and long, blond hair. The \"clothes\" they appear to wear are actually part of their body, resembling a circular red bra and skirt. Jynx have no visible feet, and in the games leave no footprints. Jynx has a pre-evolution, Smoochum, which evolves into Jynx when it receives enough experience from battles and reaches level 30.\n\nJynx Pokémon walk in a dance-like fashion, wiggling their hips in a manner described by Nintendo as \"seductive\". It uses dancing to communicate, with the exact rhythm relying on its emotion at the time. The dance affects people, causing them to themselves dance with no regard to their actions. Jynx speak in a language that only other Jynx can understand, though the sound is described as similar to human speech. This trait is carried on to games where Pokémon speak English such as the \"Pokémon Mystery Dungeon\" series, with the text appearing as combinations of \"X\"s, \"O\"s, punctuation marks, and/or musical notes, instead of legible words. Jynx are psychic, and can attack either by kissing an opponent or launching \"strange orbs\" at them, and can protect themselves with a psychically-generated barrier.\n\nIn \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\" and their remakes, \"Pokémon FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\", Jynx is a rare Pokémon that is only available through trading with an in-game NPC. In addition, the Kanto Elite Four member Lorelei uses a Jynx on her team. Jynx appears in the wild in \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\", \"Pokémon Platinum\", \"Pokémon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\", and \"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\". Because of the controversy of Jynx's skin, it was changed from black to purple in \"Pokémon Stadium 2\" and all later games. Jynx is the evolved form of Smoochum. Outside of the main series, Jynx appeared in \"Pokémon Snap\", \"Pokémon Pinball\", , and the \"Pokémon Ranger\" games.\n\nJynx first appeared in the Pokémon anime in \"Holiday Hi-Jynx\" when one of Santa Claus's Jynx was separated from him, Ash and friends helped to return the Jynx to her owner. The episode was not re-aired in USA because of the controversy over her appearance. However, it was placed on On-Demand on 2011, so people who live in USA could have easily viewed it then. Jynx appeared again in the episode \"The Ice Cave\", which was not aired in English-speaking countries for the same reason. Jynx also made a cameo as a doll that Misty wins. Jynx later appears in \"Pokémon Orange Islands\" series, in episodes still present in American rotations.\n\nJynx made an appearance in a contest in \"All Things Bright and Beautifly\". However, because Jynx had been animated with black skin instead of purple, her 13-second appearance was cut from the English dub. Jynx later appears in episodes 116 and 117 of \"\", with the inoffensive purple skin color. Because the main order of these episodes would have been during February which is also Black History Month, KidsWB chose to air these episodes out of order and air them in April after the Hoenn Championship League episodes as it would help build the ratings with the Grand Festival and Hoenn League episodes and it would have avoided offending people during February due to the Jynx controversy. However one exception was in the episode \"Hi Ho Silver Wind!\" where a purple Jynx had a minor cameo which aired in February. These episodes were aired in the normal rotational order in the UK. A trio of Jynx sisters were later depicted in the episode \"Three Jynx and a Baby\". These three Jynx were overly-protective towards their sister, a Smoochum. The Smoochum evolved into a Jynx at the end of the episode.\n\nJynx's most notable role in the Pokémon manga is being under the ownership of Lorelei in Pokémon Adventures. Lorelei's Jynx is noted for having the ability to generate voodoo dolls out of ice using its Ice Beam. When Lorelei draws crosses on any part of the dolls using her lipstick, ice shackles form on the specified body parts of her targets, eventually freezing the victim over completely. Even after the victims are broken free, the freeze induces lasting numbness in the areas where it was applied. Both Red and Sabrina suffered this condition and had to seek a cure atop Mt. Silver by bathing in the hotsprings there. Another ability of Lorelei's Jynx is revealed in the Sevii Islands saga: she can create a wispy band of ice around targets, with which Lorelei can use to track down using her powder case.\n\nJynx has made a number of appearances in the \"Pokémon Trading Card Game\", with the black-skinned design (sometimes US version cards show up purple and edited before the controversy) before the Weatherford controversy, and with the purple-skinned design after Nintendo regained control of the Pokémon TCG. Jynx first appeared in the Base Set with her black-skinned design, but later reprints of this card have the purple-skinned design.\n\nJynx's appearance and design have received criticisms in various publications. Children's book author and cultural critic Carole Boston Weatherford published an article in the \"Greensboro News & Record\" alleging that Jynx's design bore a striking resemblance to blackface actors, an image considered racist against black people, and further described the Pokémon as \"a dead ringer for an obese drag queen.\" She further criticized the Pokémon in the magazine \"Advertising Age\", comparing it to \"Little Black Sambo\" and suggesting its English name as also a possible derogatory remark towards blacks relating to voodoo (with its original Japanese name, Rougela, being unrelated). Since then, the Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University has listed Jynx as an example of racism in modern material. In response, Game Freak modified Jynx's design in localized versions of the games, a change which would several years later be reflected in the Japanese versions of the games and the anime series. In addition, episodes featuring the older Jynx design were censored or completely removed from televised syndication by Warner Bros.\n\nCriticisms still persist, such as 1UP.com which, in an article discussing the \"lamest Pokémon\" of the series, referred to it as the \"infamous blackface Pokémon\". \"Washington Post\" writer Mary C. Morton described Jynx as having \"explicitly, albeit grossly caricatured, womanly features\", and challenged the assertion that the games crossed gender barriers with such. In their podcast, \"Retronauts\", they emphasized it further, noting the design as \"creepy\" and that it maintained the issue of racism still. \"IGN\" also criticized the design, characterizing Jynx as a \"transvestite midget in racially offensive makeup\". GameDaily ranked it first on their list of the \"Top 10 Weirdest Looking Pokémon\", noting its design suggested the presence of breasts, and echoing qualms regarding its resemblance to blackface performers. Games.net ranked it fourth on their \"Top 10 Disturbingly Sexual Game Characters\" list, questioning why the character was clothed in what resembled a \"slinky dress and push-up bra\". On the other hand, the book \"Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific\" defended Jynx's design, suggesting Sugimori developed it to draw upon the humor of heta-uma (a term meaning bad/nice), and described the design as oscillating between the poles of good and bad, as a result offering diversity within the game and inviting scrutiny from players. GamesRadar described Magmar and Jynx as the Romeo and Juliet of Pokémon. GamesRadar's Carolyn Gudmundson compared Jynx to the Gothita line due to both's designs being based on an \"overtly feminine form\", though describing Gothita's line as \"way less creepy\". Author Loredana Lipperini described Jynx as an \"opera singer\". GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson listed \"Humanoid\" as one of the most overused Pokémon designs, listing Jynx and Mr. Mime as one of \"the most infamous\" examples.\n\n\n"}

On July 25, 2017, Jun Fukushima and Takahashi, the voice actors of Kazuma and Megumin respectively, announced plans for a new \"KonoSuba\" anime project.\n\nOn October 6, 2018, it was announced that characters from \"KonoSuba\" would appear in \"Isekai Quartet\", a crossover anime also featuring characters from \"\", \"Overlord\", and \"The Saga of Tanya the Evil\".\n\nA PC video game developed by game creator Tachi, titled , is bundled with the first Blu-ray Disc/DVD volume of the anime series on March 25, 2016. The game is developed using the software RPG Maker VX. Another video game, created by Team Ladybug and Krobon, titled \"KonoSuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! Revival of Beldia\" () is bundled with the limited edition of first Blu-ray Disc/DVD volume of the anime series' second season and was released on April 28, 2017. The game is a side-scroller with gameplay resembling the \"Mega Man\" series.\n\nA visual novel adaptation for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4, \"KonoSuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! Judgment on this Greedy Game!\" (), was developed by 5pb., published by Ubisoft and was released in Japan on September 7, 2017. The game features an original story, in which Kazuma discovers a cursed ring that allows him to steal the underwear of others near him. He learns the only way to undo the curse would be through raising enough money. \"Judgment on this Greedy Game!\" introduces an \"Underwear Judgment\" system, where the player assists Kazuma in returning lost underwear to their rightful owner. Like the anime, Machico performed the opening (\"Million Smile\"), while Amamiya, Takahashi, and Kayano sang the game's ending theme (\"101 Pikime no Hitsuji\").\n\nOn June 25, 2018, a film adaptation titled was announced to be in development at J.C.Staff. The cast and staff are set to reprise their roles from the TV series. The film is titled , and is scheduled to premiere in 2019.\n\nA radio drama CD, featuring a different voice cast to the anime, was released by HobiRecords on March 1, 2015. A second drama CD, along with an original soundtrack by Kouda Masato and a character song album, was released in March 2017.\n\nThe \"KonoSuba\" light novels have been quite popular. As of March 2, 2016, the 11-volume series has a total of 1.5 million copies in print, each volume selling 136,000 copies. As of February 2017, the light novels had three million copies in print. In a review of the first novel, Andy Hanley praised the series' comedy reflected in the \"tired genre\" as well as its cast finding them appealing based on their traits. However, Hanley criticized the short length of the first volume. The series won BookWalker's 2016 Grand Prix Award.\n\nLike its light novel counterpart, the anime has received positive reception for its comedy, parody of the \"trapped in a fantasy world\" subgenre, and faithful adaptation of the light novels. Reviewing the first few episodes, Anime News Network (ANN)'s Theron Martin described the second episode as \"the funniest episode of anime I have seen since \"Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun\" aired\", while also praising the series' musical score. The voice acting has also been a subject of praise; Nick Creamer of ANN commended Sora Amamiya and Rie Takahashi's roles as Aqua and Megumin for the energy provided in their performances, while Martin applauded Jun Fukushima for his work in voicing Kazuma, considering his dry tone an additional factor in the show's humor.\n\nIn contrast, a common criticism of the anime was its inconsistent character animation, one that was described as \"low budget\" as characters appeared off-model. Koichi Kikuta responded by stating such design was intentional, hoping to \"bring out the individuality of each character\" rather than the prettier artwork in the light novels; to do this, Kikuta's animation displayed \"their more human sides, like their unflattering traits and their distressed moments.\" Crunchyroll's Kim Morrissy considered the animation to be humorous, especially fitting in a comedic anime. Kotaku writer Richard Eisenbeis explained much of the series' humor derives from the deconstruction of Kazuma's hopes of becoming the hero of a fantasy world, instead realizing he is forced to struggle his way through the world. Comparing Kazuma's problems in a fantasy world to those in real life, Creamer wrote about a sense of relatability between the series' protagonists and the audience, as the party deals with issues like debt and taking questionable jobs because of high pay. On a critical note, Creamer disapproved of Kazuma's negative attitude, which he felt harmed the comedy in the series.\n\n\"KonoSuba\" characters, especially those in Kazuma's party, have gained favorable thoughts in the anime community. Creamer described the group as possessing a \"strange but endearing chemistry,\" as the members are unfriendly with one another, yet are close. Morrissy added the party's \"emotional bond is also evident in the ways they interact with each other. My favorite thing about the anime is that it takes the time to draw these nuances out onscreen and express them with visual flair.\" Megumin in particular has been considered one of the series' most popular characters, winning Sneaker Bunko's official Favorite \"KonoSuba\" Character poll. She was also the sixth-highest vote in \"Newtype\" 2015–16 Awards for Best Female Character (Kazuma was third in the male category) and received the most \"Other\" votes in the Best Girl category in Crunchyroll's Anime Awards 2016. In an interview with internet personality The Anime Man, Natsume Akatsuki described Megumin as giving off \"a pure and elegant atmosphere\" like one of an anime heroine or waifu, hence her popularity among fans.\n\nIn 2016, the anime was voted the tenth-best TV anime in the \"Newtype\" 2015–16 Awards. \"KonoSuba\" also finished runner-up for Best Comedy in the Anime Awards 2016 to \"Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto\".\n\n\n"}

In fact, the Hegelian dialectic was considered best displayed in film editing through the Kuleshov Experiment and the development of montage.\n\nWhile this structuralist approach to Marxism and filmmaking was used, the more vociferous complaint that the Russian filmmakers had was with the narrative structure of the cinema of the United States.\n\nEisenstein's solution was to shun narrative structure by eliminating the individual protagonist and tell stories where the action is moved by the group and the story is told through a clash of one image against the next (whether in composition, motion, or idea) so that the audience is never lulled into believing that they are watching something that has not been worked over.\n\nEisenstein himself, however, was accused by the Soviet authorities under Joseph Stalin of \"formalist error,\" of highlighting form as a thing of beauty instead of portraying the worker nobly.\n\nFrench Marxist film makers, such as Jean-Luc Godard, would employ radical editing and choice of subject matter, as well as subversive parody, to heighten class consciousness and promote Marxist ideas.\n\nSituationist film maker Guy Debord, author of \"The Society of the Spectacle\", began his film \"In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni\" [Wandering around in the night we are consumed by fire] with a radical critique of the spectator who goes to the cinema to forget about his dispossessed daily life.\n\nSituationist film makers produced a number of important films, where the only contribution by the situationist film cooperative was the sound-track. In \"Can dialectics break bricks?\" (1973) a Chinese Kung Fu film was transformed by redubbing into an epistle on state capitalism and Proletarian revolution. The intellectual technique of using capitalism's own structures against itself is known as détournement. \n\nMarxist film theory has developed from these precise and historical beginnings and is now sometimes viewed in a wider way to refer to any power relationships or structures within a moving image text. \n\n\n"}

The proprietress of the okiya is called \"okā-san\" (the Japanese word for \"mother\"). The okiya normally pays all expenses, including for kimono and training. The okiya plays a large part in the life of a geiko or maiko, as the women in the okiya become her geisha family, and the okā-san manages her career in the \"karyūkai\" (flower and willow world). \n\n\"Geiko\" (Kyoto dialect for geisha) live in an \"okiya\" and work in a teahouse (ochaya), where there are music, dancing, partying, sometimes food, and plenty of alcohol. A geisha pays a percentage of her earnings to maintain the house and support all the people living there who are not working geisha, including \"maiko\" (apprentice geisha), retired geisha and house maids. Kyoto is one of the places where the strict geisha training continues still and the geiko traditions are handed down. \n\nThere may be more than one geisha or maiko living in an okiya at any given point. Inversely, there are houses licensed as okiya but without any geisha. Generally, a geisha who has fulfilled her financial obligations to the house may choose to live independently but will remain affiliated with the okiya for the remainder of her career. Inside the small confines of the geiko communities, it is women who wield power: everyone hopes for girl children, so that they can carry on the line of geisha. If a woman has a boy, she must move out or give him up, as it is forbidden for men to live in an okiya. For all of their focus on men when they are at work, geiko and maiko live in a matriarchal society. Women run the okiya, women teach girls the skills they need to become a full-fledged geisha, and women introduce new maiko into the teahouses that will be their livelihood. Women run the teahouses, too, and they can make or break a geisha's career. If a geisha offends the mistress of the main teahouse where she does business, she may lose her livelihood entirely. \n\nThe okā-san of the okiya may adopt one of the geisha as her daughter (\"musume\") and heiress (\"atotori\"). Henceforth that girl will live in the okiya permanently and all the money she earns will go to that establishment and other people who help to take care of the geisha's outfits, hairstyles and accessories. Under such an arrangement, the geisha's debts are absorbed by the okiya.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

In modern literature it is often accompanied by an ironic twist of fate related to the character's own action.\n\nEnglish drama critic Thomas Rymer coined the phrase in \"The Tragedies of the Last Age Considere'd\" (1678) to describe how a work should inspire proper moral behaviour in its audience by illustrating the triumph of good over evil. The demand for poetic justice is consistent in Classical authorities and shows up in Horace, Plutarch, and Quintillian, so Rymer's phrasing is a reflection of a commonplace. Philip Sidney, in \"Defense of Poetry,\" argued that poetic justice was, in fact, the reason that fiction should be allowed in a civilized nation.\n\nNotably, poetic justice does not merely require that vice be punished and virtue rewarded, but also that logic triumph. If, for example, a character is dominated by greed for most of a romance or drama; he cannot become generous. The action of a play, poem, or fiction must obey the rules of logic as well as morality. During the late 17th century, critics pursuing a neo-classical standard would criticize William Shakespeare in favor of Ben Jonson precisely on the grounds that Shakespeare's characters change during the course of the play. (See Shakespeare's reputation for more on the Shakespeare/Jonson dichotomy.) When Restoration comedy, in particular, flouted poetic justice by rewarding libertines and punishing dull-witted moralists, there was a backlash in favor of drama, in particular, of more strict moral correspondence.\n\n"}

Originally active in theatre, in 1940 she starred in the romance film \"Kartinah\", which her first husband Andjar directed.\n\nAfter appearing in several further films, she made her directorial debut in 1950 with \"Sedap Malam\" (\"Sweetness of the Night\"), which made her the first female film director in Indonesian history. Although her work was generally ignored, later female Indonesian directors have found critical acclaim.\n\nRatna was born in the Minangkabau Highlands of Sumatra 1914. This ethnic Sundanese actress had a sister, Suhara, who was married to the director Bachtiar Effendi.\n\nRatna and her husband Andjar joined the Dardanella touring troupe in the early 1930s; with the troupe she was known for the quality of her voice. In the late 1930s she joined Andjar with his Bollero troupe and became its star. She also acted for the Royal Balinese Dancers.\n\nWhen Andjar was asked by The Teng Chun to direct a film for The's company Java Industrial Film (JIF), Ratna came with him. The couple earned 1,000 gulden each for their role in the resulting film, \"Kartinah\" (1940), Andjar as director and Ratna as its star. The film, a love story between the nurse Kartinah (played by Ratna) and her commander, was also the first war film in the country, taking place within the Air Raid Preparation teams ().\n\nRatna also appeared in Andjar's later directorial work, \"Noesa Penida\" (a love story set in Bali) and in \"Ratna Moetoe Manikam\", a story about a love triangle between two goddesses and a mortal man. During the National Revolution following Indonesia's independence, Ratna appeared in one further film: Andjar's 1948 \"Djaoeh Dimata\" (\"Out of Sight\").\n\nIn 1950, Ratna was commissioned by Djamaluddin Malik to direct the film \"Sedap Malam\" (\"Sweetness of the Night\") for Malik's company Persari; Malik produced. Andjar wrote the screenplay. This made her the first female film director in the country. This was followed by two further films for the ethnic Chinese-owned Djakarta Film, both of which Andjar wrote: \"Musim Bunga di Selabintana\" (\"Spring in Selabintana\") in 1951 and \"Dr Samsi\" in 1952.\n\nIn 1953, Ratna established Ratna Films, which had a single production, \"Nelajan\" (\"The Fishermen\"), before being rebranded Asmara Films. This new company produced \"Dewi dan Pemilihan Umum\" (\"Dewi and the Election\") in 1954, with Ratna as director; this coincided with the first legislative elections in 1955.\n\nRatna left Indonesia for Italy to study film in 1954. She had died by 1981.\n\nAfter Ratna, only three female directors appeared in Indonesian cinema until near the end of the 20th century: Citra Dewi, Sofia W.D., and Ida Farida. These directors rarely, if ever, received the same recognition as their male counterparts; acting remained the only way for a woman in the industry to gain recognition. Indeed, during her directorial career Ratna received little support from male directors.\n\nAfter the fall of Suharto in 1998, the number of women directors has increased dramatically, with several of them receiving national and international recognition. The earliest in this generation are Mira Lesmana and Nan Achnas, who collaborated with several other directors in \"Kuldesak\" (1999). Further examples include Nia Dinata, who has had two of her films, \"Ca-bau-kan\" (2002) and \"Berbagi Suami\" (2006) submitted for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film; Ucu Agustin has been described as \"one of Indonesia’s top documentary filmmakers\" and had her films screened internationally; while Djenar Maesa Ayu's \"Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!\" (2008) was on several lists of the best films of the year.\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n"}

According to Zermelo's theorem, a hypothetically determinable optimal strategy does exist for chess and chess-like games.\n\nIn a weaker sense, \"solving chess\" may refer to proving which one of the three possible outcomes (White wins; Black wins; draw) is the result of two perfect players, without necessarily revealing the optimal strategy itself (see indirect proof).\n\nNo complete solution for chess in either of the two senses is known, nor is it expected that chess will be solved in the near future. There is disagreement on whether the current exponential growth of computing power will continue long enough to someday allow for solving it by \"brute force\", i.e. by checking all possibilities.\n\nEndgame tablebases have solved chess to a limited degree, determining perfect play in a number of endgames, including all non-trivial endgames with no more than seven pieces or pawns (including the two kings).\n\nOne consequence of developing the 7-piece endgame tablebase, is that many interesting theoretical chess endings have been found. One example is a \"mate-in-546\" position, which with perfect play is a forced checkmate in 546 moves.\n\nSuch a position is beyond the ability of any human to solve, and indeed no chess engine plays it correctly (unless the engine itself is designed to have access to the tablebase).\n\nFinding positions such as this can make one speculate what other interesting chess situations will be found, as more chess positions are solved. \n\nInformation theorist Claude Shannon argued in 1951 that it is not feasible for any computer to actually solve chess, since it would either need to compare some 10 possible game variations, or have a \"dictionary\" denoting an optimal move for each of the about 10 possible board positions. It is thus theoretically possible to solve chess, but the time frame required (according to Shannon, 10 years) puts this possibility beyond the limits of any feasible technology.\n\nThe number of mathematical operations required to solve chess, however, may be significantly different than the number of operations required to produce the entire game-tree of chess. In particular, if White has a forced win, only a subset of the game-tree would require evaluation to confirm that a forced-win exists (i.e. with no refutations from Black). Furthermore, Shannon's calculation for the complexity of chess assumes an average game length of 40 moves, but there is no mathematical basis to say that a forced win by either side would have any relation to this game length. Indeed, some expertly played games (grandmaster-level play) have been as short as 16 moves. For these reasons, mathematicians and game theorists have been reluctant to categorically state that solving chess is an intractable problem.\n\nHans-Joachim Bremermann, a professor of mathematics and biophysics at the University of California at Berkeley, further argued in a 1965 paper that the \"speed, memory, and processing capacity of any possible future computer equipment are limited by specific physical barriers: the \"light barrier\", the \"quantum barrier\", and the \"thermodynamical barrier\". These limitations imply, for example, that no computer, however constructed, will ever be able to examine the entire tree of possible move sequences of the game of chess.\" Nonetheless, Bremermann did not foreclose the possibility that a computer would someday be able to solve chess. He wrote, \"In order to have a computer play a perfect or nearly perfect game, it will be necessary either to analyze the game completely ... or to analyze the game in an approximate way and combine this with a limited amount of tree searching. ... A theoretical understanding of such heuristic programming, however, is still very much wanting.\"\n\nRecent scientific advances have not significantly changed these assessments. The game of checkers was (weakly) solved in 2007, but it has roughly the square root of the number of positions in chess. Jonathan Schaeffer, the scientist who led the effort, said a breakthrough such as quantum computing would be needed before solving chess could even be attempted, but he does not rule out the possibility, saying that the one thing he learned from his 16-year effort of solving checkers \"is to never underestimate the advances in technology\".\n\nSome chess variants which are simpler than chess have been solved. A winning strategy for black in Maharajah and the Sepoys can be easily memorised. The 5×5 Gardner's Minichess variant has been weakly solved as a draw. Although Losing chess is played on an 8x8 board, its forced capture rule greatly limits its complexity and a computational analysis managed to weakly solve this variant as a win for white.\n\nThe prospect of solving individual, specific, chess-like games becomes more difficult as the board-size is increased, such as in large chess variants, and infinite chess.\n\n\n"}

She was a sensation and soon became the lead diving girl for Doc's act as they traveled the country and the first diving girl quit.\n\nSonora fell in love with and eventually married Doc's son, Albert (Al) Floyd Carver, in October 1928. Al had taken over the show in 1927, after the death of Dr. Carver. Sonora's sister Arnette Webster French followed in her footsteps, becoming a horse diver and joining the show in 1928.\n\nIn 1931, Sonora was blinded by retinal detachment, due to hitting the water off balance with her eyes open, while diving her horse, Red Lips, on Atlantic City's Steel Pier, the act's permanent home since 1929. After her accident she continued to dive horses until 1942. Arnette left the show in 1935.\n\nArnette explained Sonora’s decision to continue riding after her accident in this way: \"The movie made a big deal about having the courage to go on riding after she lost her sight. But, the truth was riding the horse was the most fun you could have and we just loved it so. We didn't want to give it up. Once you were on the horse, there really wasn't much to do but hold on. The horse was in charge.\"\n\nArnette, who was 15 when she took her first horse dive, remarked in an interview that \"Wherever we went, the S.P.C.A. (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) was always snooping around, trying to find if we were doing anything that was cruel to animals. They never found anything because those horses lived the life of Riley. In all the years of the act, there was never a horse that was injured.\"\n\nSonora's account can be read in her 1961 book, \"A Girl and Five Brave Horses\", and seen in the fictionalized movie version of her life, \"Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken\", starring Gabrielle Anwar. She was disappointed in the way that the movie depicted her life and career. She remarked to Arnette after screening the film that \"the only thing true in it was that I rode diving horses, I went blind, and I continued to ride for another 11 years.\"\n\nSonora died at the age of 99 on September 21, 2003. She lived in Pleasantville, New Jersey at the time of her death.\n\n\n"}

It is the third game in the \"Street Fighter Alpha\" sub-series, which serves as a prequel to \"Street Fighter II\", and ran on the same CP System II hardware as previous \"Alpha\" games. The game was produced after the \"Street Fighter III\" sub-series has started, being released after \"\", but before \"\". \"Alpha 3\" further expanded the playable fighter roster from \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\" and added new features such as selectable fighting styles called \"isms\".\n\n\"Alpha 3\" has also been released on a variety of home platforms starting with the PlayStation port in 1998, which added an exclusive World Tour mode and brought back even more characters, with further versions on the Sega Saturn, Dreamcast, Game Boy Advance and PlayStation Portable. The game was also included in the \"Street Fighter Alpha Anthology\", as well as the \"Street Fighter 30 Anniversary Collection\".\n\n\"Street Fighter Alpha 3\" discards the \"Manual\" and \"Auto\" modes from the previous \"Alpha\" games and instead offers three different playing styles known as \"isms\" for players to choose from. The standard playing style, A-ism (or Z-ism in Japan), is based on the previous \"Alpha\" games, in which the player has a three-level Super Combo gauge with access to several Super Combo moves. X-ism is a simple style based on \"Super Street Fighter II Turbo\", in which the player has a single-level Super Combo gauge and access to a single but powerful Super Combo move. The third style, V-ism (or \"variable\" style), is a unique style that allows the player to perform custom combos similar to the ones in \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\", but cannot use Super Combos. In X-ism, players cannot air-block nor perform Alpha Counters, and can only use 1 Super Combo move in its powerful Level 3 version. X-ism has the highest attack power but least defence, A-ism has more attack power than V-ism and a similar level of defence. All three modes have variations of movesets for each character, adding considerable depth to the gameplay. If 3 modes weren't enough there are hidden modes too that add handicaps to the player as well as benefits (E.g. Classic Mode while you cannot use super combos you cannot be knocked in the air and juggled).\n\n\"Alpha 3\" also introduces a \"Guard Power Gauge\" which depletes each time the player blocks – if the gauge is completely depleted, then the player will remain vulnerable to an attack. When broken the bar shrinks and is refilled to its new maximum, it can be shrunk a number of times. Worth noting, while in X-Ism the character has the least defence of all modes it also has the largest guard bar, vice versa for V-ism with A-Zism being in the middle. Also the guard bar varies between characters, Zangief e.g. has a very large guard bar. The guard bar does not exist in Dramatic Battle matches so no guard crushing is possible there.\n\nThe I-ism style is customizable when selecting which character and super gauge to be used, which is only exclusive to Dreamcast version's Saikyo Dojo Mode, or PSP version's MAX update on World Tour or/and Entry Modes.\n\nThe controls for several actions have been modified from the previous \"Alpha\" games. For example, the level of a Super Combo move in A-ism is now determined by the strength of the attack button pressed (i.e. Medium Punch or Kick for a Lv. 2 Super Combo), rather than the number of buttons pushed; and throwing is now done by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously. \n\nThe game brings back all eighteen of the characters that appeared in \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\". As with the previous \"Alpha\" titles, several characters were added to the game: Cammy, who was previously featured in the console-exclusive \"Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold\", E. Honda, Blanka, Balrog, and Vega. New characters introduced in \"Alpha 3\" include R. Mika, a Japanese female wrestler who idolizes Zangief; Karin, Sakura's rival who was first introduced in the \"Street Fighter\" manga \"Sakura Ganbaru!\" by Masahiko Nakahira; Cody from \"Final Fight\", who has since become an escaped convict; and Juli and Juni, two of Shadaloo's \"Dolls\" who serve as Bison's assassins and guards.\n\nThe PlayStation version added the remaining characters introduced in \"Super Street Fighter II\": Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk, along with Guile from \"Street Fighter II\", Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma from \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\", the latter three being unlockable. The Sega Saturn and Dreamcast versions move Guile and Evil Ryu to the default.\n\nThe Game Boy Advance port contains all of the characters from previous versions, as well as three additional characters: Yun from \"Street Fighter III\", Maki from \"Final Fight 2\", and Eagle from the original \"Street Fighter\", all three based on their incarnations from \"\". The PlayStation Portable version, \"Street Fighter Alpha 3 MAX\", also adds Ingrid from \"Capcom Fighting Evolution\", to bring the total character count to 38 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn release, \"Famitsu\" magazine scored the Sega Saturn version of the game a 32 out of 40; they later scored it 30 out of 40. The PlayStation version also scored 32 out of 40 on release. The Dreamcast version scored slightly better, receiving a 33 out of 40.\n\nThe \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" said that the game would outlast \"Tekken 3\", and stated \"the only thing to tarnish this is the graphics. So if you think gameplay is more important than texture-mapped polygons, consider the score to be a ten.\"\n\nBy 2003, the Game Boy Advance version had sold over 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, the original PlayStation version sold a million units as of June 2016.\n"}

It stars the voices of Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, Clark Duke, and Cloris Leachman. The film is set in a fictional prehistoric Pliocene era known as \"The Croodaceous\" (a prehistoric period which contains fictional prehistoric creatures) when a caveman's position as a \"Leader of the Hunt\" is threatened by the arrival of a prehistoric genius who comes up with revolutionary new inventions as they trek through a dangerous but exotic land in search of a new home.\n\n\"The Croods\" was written and directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders, and produced by Kristine Belson and Jane Hartwell. The film premiered at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival on February 15, 2013, and was released in the United States on March 22, 2013. As part of the distribution deal, this was the first DreamWorks Animation film to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, since the end of their distribution deal with Paramount Pictures.\n\n\"The Croods\" received generally positive reviews, and proved to be a box office success, earning more than $587 million on a budget of $135 million. It was nominated for Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and for Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. The film launched a new franchise, with a television series, \"Dawn of the Croods\", which debuted on December 24, 2015, on Netflix. A sequel was announced for a 2017 release, but was later cancelled. However, it was put back into production in 2017 with a release date scheduled for September 18, 2020.\n\nA cave family called the Croods survives, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn, stern patriarch, father, Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home.\n\nEep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \"different\" and \"new\", they destroy her horn.\n\nA massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a \"Macawnivore\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \"Chunky\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired, but Grug doesn't listen.\n\nWhen Grug finds a bird, he decides to hunt its egg for dinner. Eep also wants to hunt the egg, but as she's grounded, she gets replaced by Thunk, who is too lazy to hunt it. Grug and Thunk fail to capture the bird's egg, so they get a scorpion instead. During a fight between Thunk and Gran, Eep notices Guy moving away and stops him. Guy wants Eep to stop, so he makes her hunt with him. Eep goes with Guy to hunt, while the others fight among themselves.\n\nEep and Guy make a trap in order to capture the bird but fail when the two get tangled up, and the bird doesn’t step in the trap. The bird captures the puppet with Guy in it and throws him up in the sky until he lands on the log. Grug asks Guy where Eep is, and he finds her being chased by the bird. Grug gets angry but doesn’t notice that he was about to step on the trap, so Eep pushes him out to save her father. The bird steps on the trap and is thrown up in the sky until it crash-lands on the ground.\n\nThe Croods cook the bird, and Guy is tied up with a root chain on his right leg. After dinner, Grug tells them a story, which is based on a true story, about a tiger who is similar to Eep and embarrasses Eep. Guy says that his stories never end up like Grug’s stories, so the Croods decide to listen to Guy’s story much to their interest. Guy tells them about a tiger who flew into a place with more suns in the sky called “Tomorrow”. Guy also tells them stories of \"Tomorrow\", a heaven of safety where he is headed and in which curiosity is not deadly as Grug has claimed.\n\nOutrunning the destruction, Guy is trusted enough to be let out of the log, and he gives the Croods rudimentary shoes to walk over the harsh landscape as he leads them to a mountain in which he says will be safe. After the family is split up in a labyrinth of tunnels, all but Grug manage to escape by coming up with ideas of overcoming obstacles in their paths. At his treetop home, Grug sees the impression Guy is leaving on his family, and he becomes jealous, especially when he realizes that Eep has fallen in love with Guy. Attempting to invent things like Guy, Grug only further embarrasses himself and drives his family further away from him.\n\nReaching the mountain, Grug tries to force his family to hide out in a cave, but they resist, telling him that they can't live in caves anymore, that they don't want to survive but to live. This enrages Grug, who attacks Guy and both of them end up in a tar flow where Grug learns that Guy's family had perished in one. Realizing that Guy's method of survival is better for his family, Grug works with him, and they lure Chunky into a trap to free themselves. The family reunites, then flees a massive cataclysm as the land begins to violently rip apart.\n\nThe family is cut off from their destination by a continental split, but Grug, realizing the errors of his ways, decides to throw his family to safety. He shares an invention he calls a \"hug\" with Eep, briefly before sending her across as well. Cut off from his family, Grug finds a cave for safety, where he encounters Chunky, who is truly a frightened and sweet feline, and he comes up with an idea to getting them across the chasm. Using a ribcage and the Piranhakeets to fashion a simple airship, Grug manages to send themselves, and several animals the family had encountered during their journey, across the chasm, reuniting with his family once again. He apologizes to them all and promises to never be so overbearing again. Later, the Croods have settled on a vast beach, where every day they can follow the light to \"Tomorrow\".\n\n\nThe film was announced in May 2005, under the working title \"Crood Awakening\", originally a stop motion film being made by Aardman Animations as a part of a \"five film deal\" with DreamWorks Animation. John Cleese and Kirk DeMicco had been working together on a feature based on Roald Dahl's story \"The Twits\", a project that never went into production.\n\nDreamWorks got a copy of their script and liked it, and invited Cleese and DeMicco over to take a look at the company's ideas to see if they found something they would like to work with. They chose a basic story idea about two cavemen on the run, an inventor and a luddite, and wrote the first few drafts of the script. In January 2007, with the departure of Aardman, the rights for the film reverted to DreamWorks.\n\nIn March 2007, Chris Sanders, the writer of \"Mulan\" and writer/director of \"Lilo & Stitch\", joined DreamWorks to direct the film, with intentions to significantly rewrite the script. In September 2008, it was reported that Sanders took over \"How to Train Your Dragon\" putting \"Crood Awakening\" on hold, and thus postponing its original schedule for a year to a then planned March 2012. The film's final title, \"The Croods\", was revealed in May 2009, along with new co-director, Kirk DeMicco. In March 2011, the film got another delay, being pushed back a year to March 1, 2013, and finally settled at March 22.\n\n\"The Croods\" had its world premiere in the out of competition section at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival on February 15, 2013. It premiered in the United States on March 22, 2013. The film was the first feature film to be shown in the 4DX format, featuring strobe lights, tilting seats, blowing wind and fog and odor effects in Hungary, which is shown at the Cinema City theater in Budapest, Hungary. It was also the first film in China to be distributed by Oriental DreamWorks, a film production and distribution company founded in 2012 by DreamWorks Animation and Chinese investment companies.\n\n\"The Croods\" was released on Blu-ray (2D and 3D) and DVD on October 1, 2013. The DVD and Blu-ray comes with a Belt plush toy.\n\n\"The Croods\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 71% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 140 reviews, with an average score of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"While it may not be as (ahem) evolved as the best modern animated fare, \"The Croods\" will prove solidly entertaining for families seeking a fast-paced, funny cartoon adventure.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, the film was given a score of 55 based on 30 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nClaudia Puig of \"USA Today\" gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, \"A visually dazzling animated adventure with a well chosen voice cast is hampered by lackluster humor and a meandering story.\" Tom Russo of \"The Boston Globe\" gave the film two and a half out of four, saying, \"Had the movie figured out a way to stay the less cliched course, it might have helped the DreamWorks oeuvre take steps toward Pixar's emotional resonance.\"\n\nKeith Staskiewicz of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a C+, and wrote in his review, \"A handful of adrenalizing sequences of animated anarchy can't save this story from feeling overly primitive.\" David Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called the film, \"Further back on the evolutionary chain than the Flintstones, and also lagging in the comedy stakes, this sweet Stone Age clan nonetheless will captivate the youngsters.\" Leslie Felperin of \"Variety\" found that, \"The main problem with the film is that the script simply isn't very funny, and its various subplots never quite mesh satisfyingly together.\"\n\nTirdad Derakhshani of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, \"The movie is well edited and lean, a fast paced, action filled bit of froth that manages to be diverting and surprisingly fun.\" Lisa Kennedy of \"The Denver Post\" gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"It captures the wonder (and more gently, the anxiety) of discovery time and time again. And the filmmakers have a hoot playing with the Croods' encounters with, as well as their misunderstandings of, all things new.\" Laremy Legel of \"Film.com\" gave the film a B, saying \"\"How to Train Your Dragon\" and \"Lilo & Stitch\" are completely indicative of the experience you'll have with \"The Croods\", which is to say a supremely positive one.\"\n\n\"The Croods\" grossed $187,168,425 in North America, and $400,036,243 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $587,204,668. According to \"Deadline Hollywood\" estimation, the film made a profit of $106.5 million. It is the eleventh highest grossing 2013 film, and the fourth highest grossing 2013 animated film (behind \"Frozen\", \"Despicable Me 2\", and \"Monsters University\"). It became the second highest grossing original DreamWorks Animation film, behind \"Kung Fu Panda\". As of January 2014, it is the 89th-highest-grossing film, and the 21st-highest-grossing animated film.\n\nIn North America, the film earned $11.6 million on its opening day. On its opening weekend, the film topped the box office with $43.6 million from 4,046 locations, a vast improvement over the DreamWorks Animation's directly preceding release \"Rise of the Guardians\", yet still below some of the studio's other original films, like \"Megamind\" and \"How to Train Your Dragon\".\n\nOutside North America, the film topped the box office during its first weekend with $62.4 million (including previews from the previous weekend). It opened at number one in 54 countries, with the biggest openings achieved in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($8.08 million), Russia and the CIS ($7.82 million), China ($6.34 million), and Mexico ($4.37 million).\n\nIn total grosses, the film's biggest market was China with $63.3 million, becoming the highest grossing original animated film, surpassing DreamWorks Animation's film \"Kung Fu Panda\". In addition, the film earned $43.1 million in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta, $28.6 million in Russia and the CIS, $27.7 million in Mexico, and $23.8 million in Australia. Earning a total of $400 million, it is the highest grossing 2013 film distributed by 20th Century Fox.\n\nAlan Silvestri composed the original music for the film, which was released digitally on March 15, 2013, by Relativity Music Group, and on CD on March 26, 2013, by Sony Classical. Silvestri had previously worked with Chris Sanders on \"Lilo & Stitch\". The soundtrack also includes \"Shine Your Way\", an original song performed by Owl City & Yuna.\n\nA video game based on the film, titled \"The Croods: Prehistoric Party!\", was released on March 19, 2013. Developed by Torus Games, Bandai Namco, and published by D3 Publisher, it was adapted for Wii U, Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo DS. The game enables players to take the members of the Croods family on an adventure through 30 party style mini games. It received mainly negative reviews.\n\nA mobile game, titled \"The Croods\", which is a village building game, was developed and published by Rovio, the creator of \"Angry Birds\". It was released on March 14, 2013 to the iOS and Android platforms. It received negative reviews from critics with Metacritic giving it a 40 out of 100.\n\nBy April 2013, DreamWorks Animation had started developing a sequel to the film, with Sanders and DeMicco returning to direct it. According to DeMicco, the sequel would focus on Ugga and motherhood, making it \"the first chapter of society,\" expanding on the first film, which is about \"the last chapter of the caveman.\"\n\nIn September 2013, it had been confirmed that Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, and Ryan Reynolds would reprise their roles in the sequel. On June 12, 2014, it was announced that the sequel would be released on November 3, 2017. Two months later, it was pushed back from its original release date of November 3, 2017 to December 22, 2017. By May 21, 2015, Leslie Mann and Kat Dennings had joined the voice cast. Mann would lend her voice to an upscale mother of a rival family, while Dennings would voice her daughter. Catherine Keener and Clark Duke would also reprise their roles. On August 9, 2016, nearing NBCUniversal/Comcast's impending acquisition of DreamWorks Animation, 20th Century Fox removed the film from its planned December 22, 2017 release schedule. The film would be instead released by Universal Pictures sometime in 2018. Two weeks later, it was reported that \"The Lego Movie\" and \"Hotel Transylvania\" co writers Kevin and Dan Hageman had been hired to rewrite the script.\n\nOn November 11, 2016, DreamWorks announced that production for the sequel was cancelled. According to reports, there had been doubts about proceeding with the project before Universal's acquisition of DreamWorks, and it was DreamWorks' decision to cancel the film. However, in September 2017, DreamWorks and Universal revealed that the movie was back in production with a release date scheduled for September 18, 2020. It was also confirmed that the original actors would reprise their roles. However, DeMicco, the co-director of the first film, won't be returning as he is directing \"Vivo\" for Sony Pictures Animation. In October 2017, it was reported that Joel Crawford will serve as director and Mark Swift is set to produce. On October 5, 2018, it was announced that Peter Dinklage had joined the cast to voice Phil Betterman.\n\nA traditionally-animated television series based on the film, titled \"Dawn of the Croods\", debuted on December 24, 2015 on Netflix. As none of the original cast members that voiced the Croods family in the film reprise their roles in the series, the voice cast consists of Dan Milano as Grug, Stephanie Lemelin as Eep, Cree Summer as Ugga, A.J. Locascio as Thunk, Laraine Newman as Gran, and Grey Griffin as Sandy.\n\n"}

The company was based in Houston and was part of privately held TNR Entertainment Corp. TNR was acquired by NCR in 2009. NCR had in 2008 partnered with Blockbuster to establish a channel for kiosk DVD rentals, and TNR's acquisition furthered this aim. NCR's DVD kiosks were purchased by Redbox in 2012 \n\nTNR was backed by an institutional investor group including Celerity Partners, LP of Los Angeles; Chapton Partners, LP, a Houston family partnership; Laminar Direct Capital, L.P., a member of the D. E. Shaw group of companies and MCG Capital, a leading specialized financial services company and financial advisor.\n\nEach of its interactive kiosks held up to 1,000 DVDs, including new releases and classic titles. To rent a movie, consumers swiped their credit card, make their selection and the machine then dispensed the movie(s). The charge per rental was $1 per day; and keeping a DVD more than 14 days was effectively the same as purchasing the DVD.\n\nThe kiosks were located at grocery stores including Albertson's, Dillon’s, Kroger, Publix and others—and promotions included a “Movie Lover’s Survey,” “Movie For a Year” and a “First Movie Free.”\n\nThe company also operated kiosks under the name \"moviecube,\" a California company which it acquired.\n\nFounded in 2002, The New Release focused primarily on the grocery channel. The first kiosks were installed in Houston, HEB locations, with later expansion into Dallas, Kroger locations. Acquired by NCR in 2009, its kiosks eventually became the property of Redbox when Redbox acquired all of NCR's DVD rental kiosks in 2012.\n\nThe New Release periodically created promotions to entice current consumers and attract new ones. The New Release held a “Movie Lover’s Survey,” where they gave away free movies to the first 500 respondents.\n\nThe New Release gave away “Movie For a Year” to 45 customers throughout North America.\n\nIn the past, The New Release produced a “First Movie Free” promotion in many of its locations nationwide.\n\n"}
{"id": "46740416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46740416", "title": "The Oh, Hello Show", "text": "The Oh, Hello Show\n\nThe Oh, Hello Show is a comedy act created by Americans Nick Kroll and John Mulaney that was popularized on Comedy Central's \"Kroll Show\". The show centers on Gil Faizon (Kroll) and George St. Geegland (Mulaney), elderly men from the Upper West Side of Manhattan who are known for their turtlenecks, misinformed beliefs, and tendency to say \"Oh, hello\" in unison. The characters appeared on several shows and in a Broadway play called \"Oh, Hello\" that ran for 138 performances at the Lyceum Theatre from September 2016 to January 2017.\n\nKroll and Mulaney developed Faizon and St. Geegland after watching two men wearing turtlenecks and blazers at The Strand bookstore purchase separate copies of Alan Alda's book \"Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: And Other Things I've Learned\". \n\nIn the early 2000s, Faizon and St. Geegland hosted a weekly show at Rififi, a New York comedy club that closed down in 2008. It was during this time that Kroll and Mulaney were able to hone their characters.\n\nRoommates George and Gil are in their 70s and have strong New York accents, and they frequently mispronounce common words and names. For example, they refer to Ashton Kutcher's show \"Punk'd\" as \"Prank'd\"; Johnny Knoxville as Johnny Nashville, and \"Candid Camera\" as \"Candy Camera\". They also frequently put the stress on the wrong syllables of words, for example, pronouncing Broadway as \"Broad\"way\"\" and junk mail as \"junk \"mail\"\". They both have shaggy gray hair and beards, wear glasses, and wear baggy clothes for an overall unkempt appearance. They met in Toronto while dodging the Vietnam War, but they did their part for the war effort by fighting with Asians they saw in Canada. George is an author and playwright and has written several shows for him and Gil to star in, usually not being well received by their audiences. They have a dog named Pug Giamatti, but he left for an adventure in Saugerties.\n\nGil's birth name is Gil Cosby, but he took his wife's last name of Faizon. Faizon has an ex-wife, son (Adam Brody), and stepson (Joe Mande). He is very proud of being Jewish, especially the Israeli settlements, and members of strict Orthodox sects who look at him disdainfully on the bus. He had a Bar Mitzvah and his Torah portion was an Archie comic. Faizon, who has more of a Brooklyn Jewish accent, often introduces himself as \"Charmed I'm sure, Gil Faizon.\" He is also a stand-in model for mashed potatoes and other creamed foods. Gil's father reportedly \"ratted out other Jews during the Holocaust.\" He suffers from bagel-induced cholesterol and eczema.\n\nGeegland was possibly born in Providence, Rhode Island or Newark, New Jersey, to verbally abusive parents sometime in the mid-1940s. He was responsible for reintroducing the polio virus to his school district. His family is Presbyterian and Dutch from St. Geegland, Van Dutch. In college, he majored in penmanship. Geegland, a former short story professor at the fictitious SUNY Yonkers, is the more aggressive of the two characters. He often yells at others, makes racist comments, and may have raped a student. His behavior indicates that he may be a psychopath. Geegland's unwritten novel, \"Rifkin's Dilemma\", is about the boyhood of a man with a fondness for masturbation. He's been married three times. All of his wives died the same way on the same staircase. His first wife's name was Inertia Bernstein. He was divorced at the age of 46. Spalding Gray personally disliked him, and he has chapped hands.\n\nThe characters of Faizon and St. Geegland were heavily popularized on Kroll's self-titled Comedy Central show, \"Kroll Show\" (2013–15), where they appeared in 11 episodes. They were presented through several different formats, including a variety of sketches, and the prank show Too Much Tuna, as hosts of a public access prank show in which unsuspecting contestants are given tuna fish sandwiches with \"too much tuna\". They usually ruined the prank by telling the contestant that a tuna fish sandwich was coming before the plate of food arrived. \"Too Much Tuna\" also carried over to their stage show.\n\nThe duo has appeared in character as guests on two episodes of \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\", promoting the Off-Broadway and Broadway runs of \"Oh, Hello\". Host Seth Meyers is a friend of both Kroll and Mulaney, having previously worked with Mulaney as a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Documentary Now!\".\n\nFaizon and St. Geegland have also appeared as guests in a season five episode of Scott Aukerman's IFC show \"Comedy Bang! Bang!\", alongside The Lonely Island. During their appearance, they talked about their extensive Broadway background, which includes producing the \"Cats\"-inspired show \"Pugs\" and \"You Snooze, You Lose\", a musical about the Terri Schiavo case. They have also appeared on several episodes of the original \"Comedy Bang! Bang!\" podcast.\n\nKroll and Mulaney have appeared in character on an episode of Conan O'Brien's TBS talk-show \"Conan\". The appearance occurred during O'Brien's week of shows taped from the Apollo Theater in New York City, which coincided with the run of \"Oh, Hello\" on Broadway. George and Gil appeared during the monologue to give O'Brien a \"welcome-back-to-New York-official-basket\", consisting of a pre-broken umbrella, a sun-faded photo of Danny Aiello, a cup of three-week old watermelon, a copy of \"Fagen's New York\", and a gift certificate to St Michael's Cemetery.\n\nTo promote \"Oh, Hello on Broadway\", Kroll and Mulaney appeared in two episodes of the Netflix talk show \"Chelsea\" as Faizon and St. Geegland. Host Chelsea Handler also uses \"Oh, hello\" as her catchphrase to open each show.\n\nFaizon and St. Geegland appear in the sketch comedy series \"Portlandia\" in the episode \"Peter Follows P!nk\" where they meet series mainstays Toni and Candace (Carrie Brownstein and Fred Armisen) and invite them to a surprise assisted suicide party.\n\n\"Oh, Hello\" premiered as an off-Broadway play on December 1, 2015 and played for several weeks at The Cherry Lane Theatre in New York's Greenwich Village. After the success of this production, Kroll and Mulaney took the show on the road, performing in San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Boston.\n\nKroll and Mulaney began a 15-week staging of the show on Broadway at the Lyceum Theater, starting on September 22, 2016, in previews and on October 10 officially. The show closed on January 22, 2017. The show received positive reviews overall. Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" helped launch the show's success by giving it an unexpected rave review during its off-Broadway run. \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it \"full of genuine laughs\", but also \"surprisingly unambitious, with no real story, no attempt to welcome new audiences, no truly great comic moments. It’s a sketch, drawn out\", giving it a \"B\". Marilyn Stasio of \"Variety\" wrote that \"Their pre-established fan base from Comedy Central, alt-comedy clubs and obscure videos should go for this sloppy, silly, occasionally inspired, extended version of their comic shtick as two affected Upper West Side geezers named Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland — but \"Oh, Hello on Broadway\" might not be the show to win over new enthusiasts.\"\n\nA recorded performance of the show featuring Steve Martin as the guest and with an appearance by Matthew Broderick was released by Netflix on June 13, 2017. A bonus clip was also released on Netflix featuring Michael J. Fox as the guest. The recorded performance received a positive review from Erik Adams of \"The A.V. Club\", who gave it a \"B+\" and called it \"a singularly funny testament to Kroll and Mulaney’s creative partnership and personal friendship\". Lea Palmieri of Decider wrote that \"\"Oh, Hello On Broadway\" might be the most ridiculous Broadway show you watch on Netflix this year, but it’s absolutely worth watching.\" She noted, however, that \"trimming about 15 minutes wouldn’t have hurt the show.\"\n"}
{"id": "925736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=925736", "title": "Turner Classic Movies", "text": "Turner Classic Movies\n\nTurner Classic Movies (TCM) is an American movie-oriented pay-TV network operated by Turner Broadcasting System, a subsidiary of AT&T's WarnerMedia. Launched in 1994, TCM is headquartered at Turner's Techwood broadcasting campus in the Midtown business district of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHistorically, the channel's programming consisted mainly of classic theatrically released feature films from the Turner Entertainment film library – which comprises films from Warner Bros. (covering films released before 1950) and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (covering films released before May 1986).\n\nHowever, TCM now has licensing deals with other Hollywood film studios as well as its WarnerMedia sister company, Warner Bros. (which now controls the Turner Entertainment library and its own later films), and occasionally shows more recent films.\n\nThe channel is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, Latin America, France, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, the Nordic countries, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific.\n\nIn 1986, eight years before the launch of Turner Classic Movies, Ted Turner acquired the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio for $1.5 billion. Concerns over Turner Entertainment's corporate debt load resulted in Turner selling the studio that October back to Kirk Kerkorian, from whom Turner had purchased the studio less than a year before.\n\nAs part of the deal, Turner Entertainment retained ownership of MGM's library of films released up to May 9, 1986. Turner Broadcasting System was split into two companies; Turner Broadcasting System and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and reincorporated as MGM/UA Communications Co.\n\nThe film library of Turner Entertainment would serve as the base form of programming for TCM upon the network's launch. Before the creation of Turner Classic Movies, films from Turner's library of movies aired on the Turner Broadcasting System's advertiser-supported cable network TNT – along with colorized versions of black-and-white classics such as \"The Maltese Falcon\".\n\nAfter the library was acquired, MGM/UA signed a deal with Turner to continue distributing the pre-May 1986 MGM and to begin distributing the pre-1950 Warner Bros. film libraries for video release (the rest of the library went to Turner Home Entertainment).\n\nTurner Classic Movies debuted on April 14, 1994, at 6 p.m. Eastern Time, with Ted Turner launching the channel at a ceremony in New York City's Times Square district. The date and time were chosen for their historical significance as \"the exact centennial anniversary of the first public movie showing in New York City\". The first movie broadcast on TCM was the 1939 film \"Gone with the Wind\", the same film that served as the debut broadcast of its sister channel TNT six years earlier in October 1988.\nAt the time of its launch, TCM was available to approximately one million cable television subscribers.\n\nThe network originally served as a competitor to AMC—which at the time was known as \"American Movie Classics\" and maintained a virtually identical format to TCM, as both networks largely focused on films released prior to 1970 and aired them in an uncut, uncolorized, and commercial-free format. AMC had broadened its film content to feature colorized and more recent films by 2002.\n\nIn the early 2000s, AMC abandoned its commercial-free format, which then led to TCM being the only movie-oriented cable channel to devote its programming entirely to classic films without commercial interruption.\n\nIn 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner which, besides placing Turner Classic Movies and Warner Bros. Entertainment under the same corporate umbrella, also gave TCM access to Warner Bros.' library of films released after 1950 (which itself includes other acquired entities such as the Lorimar, Saul Zaentz and National General Pictures libraries); incidentally, TCM had already been running select Warner Bros. film titles through a licensing agreement with the studio that was signed prior to the launch of the channel. In March 1999, MGM paid Warner Bros. and gave up the home video rights to the MGM/UA films owned by Turner to Warner Home Video.\n\nIn 2000, TCM started the annual Young Composers Film Competition, inviting aspiring composers to participate in a judged competition that offers the winner of each year's competition the opportunity to score a restored, feature-length silent film as a grand prize, mentored by a well-known composer, with the new work subsequently premiering on the network. As of 2006, films that have been rescored include the 1921 Rudolph Valentino film \"Camille\", two Lon Chaney films: 1921's \"The Ace of Hearts\" and 1928's \"Laugh, Clown, Laugh\", and Greta Garbo's 1926 film \"The Temptress\".\n\nIn April 2010, Turner Classic Movies held the first TCM Classic Film Festival, an event—now held annually—at the Grauman's Chinese Theater and the Grauman's Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. Initially hosted by Robert Osborne, the four-day long annual festival celebrates Hollywood and its movies, and featured celebrity appearances, special events, and screenings of around 50 classic movies including several newly restored by \"The Film Foundation\", an organization devoted to preserving Hollywood's classic film legacy.\n\nTurner Classic Movies essentially operates as a commercial-free service, with the only advertisements on the network being shown between features – which advertise TCM products, network promotions for upcoming special programs and the original trailers for films that are scheduled to be broadcast on TCM (particularly those that will air during the primetime hours), and featurettes about classic film actors and actresses. In addition to this, extended breaks between features are filled with theatrically released movie trailers and classic short subjects – from series such as \"The Passing Parade\", \"Crime Does Not Pay\", \"Pete Smith Specialties\", and Robert Benchley – under the banner name \"TCM Extras\" (formerly \"One Reel Wonders\"). In 2007, some of the short films featured on TCM were made available for streaming on TCM's website. Partly to allow these interstitials, Turner Classic Movies schedules its feature films either at the top of the hour or at :15, :30 or :45 minutes past the hour, instead of in timeslots of varying five-minute increments.\n\nTCM's film content has remained mostly uncut and uncolorized (with films natively filmed or post-produced in the format being those only ones presented in color), depending upon the original content of movies, particularly movies released after the 1968 implementation of the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings system and the concurrent disestablishment of the Motion Picture Production Code. Because of this, TCM is formatted similarly to a premium channel with certain films – particularly those made from the 1960s onward – sometimes featuring nudity, sexual content, violence and/or strong profanity; the network also features rating bumpers prior to the start of a program (most programs on TCM, especially films, are rated for content using the TV Parental Guidelines, in lieu of the MPAA's rating system).\n\nThe network's programming season runs from February until the following March of each year when a retrospective of Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated movies is shown, called \"31 Days of Oscar\". As a result of its devoted format to classic feature films, viewers who are interested in tracing the career development of actresses such as Barbara Stanwyck or Greta Garbo or actors like Cary Grant or Humphrey Bogart have the unique opportunity to see most of the films that were made during their careers, from beginning to end. Turner Classic Movies presents many of its features in their original aspect ratio (widescreen or full screen) whenever possible – widescreen films broadcast on TCM are letterboxed on the network's standard definition feed. TCM also regularly presents widescreen presentations of films not available in the format on any home video release.\n\nOccasionally, TCM shows restored versions of films, particularly old silent films with newly commissioned musical soundtracks. Turner Classic Movies is also a major backer of the Descriptive Video Service (created by Boston PBS member station WGBH-TV), with many of the films aired on the network offering visual description for the blind and visually impaired, which is accessible through the second audio program option through most television sets, or a cable or satellite receiver.\n\nTCM publishes \"Now Playing\", a monthly guide, originally available through a standalone subscription, which provides daily listings and descriptions for films scheduled to air on Turner Classic Movies in the coming month. The digest-size magazine highlights a featured actor on the cover, and features essays about the \"guest programmer\" as well as a movie-and-actor themed crossword puzzle. The May 2017 issue, following the death in March 2017 of host Robert Osborne, contained \"Remembering Robert Osborne\" by Ben Mankiewicz. TCM ceased print publication of \"Now Playing\" (which had been one of the few channel-specific program guides that remained in print circulation for most of the 2000s and 2010s) with the August 2017 issue, moving it to an electronic format available via email free of charge.\n\nTCM's library of films spans several decades of cinema and includes thousands of film titles. Besides its deals to broadcast film releases from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros. Entertainment, Turner Classic Movies also maintains movie licensing rights agreements with Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox as FX Movie Channel, Walt Disney Studios (primarily film content from Walt Disney Pictures), as well as most of the Selznick International Pictures library, Sony Pictures Entertainment (primarily film content from Columbia Pictures), StudioCanal, and Janus Films.\n\nMost Paramount sound releases made prior to 1950 are owned by EMKA, Ltd./NBCUniversal Television Distribution, while Paramount (currently owned by Viacom) holds on to most of its post-1949 releases, which are distributed for television by Trifecta Entertainment & Media. Columbia's film output is owned by Sony (through Sony Pictures Television); distribution of 20th Century Fox's film library is handled for television by its 21st Century Fox subsidiary 20th Television, and the Walt Disney Studios (owned by The Walt Disney Company) has its library film output handled for television by Disney-ABC Domestic Television. Classic films released by 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, and Columbia Pictures are licensed individually for broadcast on Turner Classic Movies.\n\nAlso TCM has aired movies from the 1900s, 1910s and the 1920s. Although most movies shown on TCM are releases from the 1930s to the 1960s, some are more contemporary – Turner Classic Movies sometimes airs films from the 1970s and 1980s, and occasionally broadcasts movies released during the 1990s and the early 2000s.\n\nMost feature movies shown during the prime time and early overnight hours (8:00 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. Eastern Time) were presented by the late film historian Robert Osborne (who had been with the network since its 1994 launch until 2016, except for a five-month medical leave from July to December 2011, when guest hosts presented each night's films), Ben Mankiewicz presenting only late evening films on Wednesday through Sunday evenings, and the \"Silent Sunday Nights\" and \"TCM Imports\" blocks on Sundays, Tiffany Vasquez presenting the films on Saturday afternoons from 2016-2018, Dave Karger presenting the films on Saturday afternoons and the primetime films on Mondays and Alicia Malone presenting the films on Sunday afternoons and the primetime films on Tuesdays.\n\nTCM regularly airs a \"Star of the Month\" throughout the year on Wednesdays starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, in which most, if not all, feature films from a classic film star are shown during that night's schedule. February and August are the only months to not have a \"Star of the Month\". The network also marks the occurrence of a film actor's birthday (either or posthumously) or recent death with day- or evening-long festivals showcasing several of that artist's best, earliest or least-known pictures; by effect, marathons scheduled in honor of an actor's passing (which are scheduled within a month after their death) pre-empt films originally scheduled to air on that date. TCM also features a monthly program block called the \"TCM Guest Programmer\", in which Osborne is joined by celebrity guests responsible for choosing that evening's films (examples of such programmers during 2012 include Jules Feiffer, Anthony Bourdain, Debra Winger, Ellen Barkin, Spike Lee, Regis Philbin and Jim Lehrer); an offshoot of this block featuring Turner Classic Movies employees aired during February 2011.\n\nTurner Classic Movies also airs regularly scheduled weekly film blocks, which are periodically preempted for special themed month-long or seasonal scheduling events, such as the \"31 Days of Oscar\" film series in the month preceding the Academy Awards and the month-long \"Summer Under the Stars\" in August; all featured programming has their own distinctive feature presentation bumper for the particular scheduled presentation. \"The Essentials\", with various hosts from 2001 through 2015, was a weekly film showcase airing on Saturday evenings (with a replay on the following Sunday at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time), which spotlighted a different movie and contained a special introduction and post-movie discussion.\n\nOne of the weekly blocks is \"Noir Alley\", featuring film noir movies. It broadcasts on Sunday mornings and is hosted by Eddie Muller. The channel also broadcasts two movie blocks during the late evening hours each Sunday: \"Silent Sunday Nights\", which features silent films from the United States and abroad, usually in the latest restored version and often with new musical scores; and \"TCM Imports\" (which previously ran on Saturdays until the early 2000s), a weekly presentation of films originally released in foreign countries. \"TCM Underground\" – which debuted in October 2006 – as Saturday late night block which focuses on cult films, the block was originally hosted by rocker/filmmaker Rob Zombie until December 2006 (though , it is the only regular film presentation block on the channel that does not have a host). \"TCM Underground\" recently changed its timeslot - it now airs Friday mornings at 2AM.\n\nEach August, Turner Classic Movies suspends its regular schedule for a special month of film marathons called \"Summer Under the Stars\", which features entire daily schedules devoted to the work of a particular actor, with movies and specials that pertain to the star of the day. In the summer of 2007, the channel debuted \"Funday Night at the Movies\", a block hosted by actor Tom Kenny (best known as the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants). This summer block featured classic feature films (such as \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Sounder\", \"Bringing Up Baby\", \"Singin' in the Rain\", \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\", and \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\") aimed at introducing these movies to new generations of children, and their families.\n\n\"Funday Night at the Movies\" was replaced in 2008 by \"Essentials Jr.\", a youth-oriented version of its weekly series, \"The Essentials\" (originally hosted by actors Abigail Breslin, and Chris O'Donnell, then by John Lithgow from 2009 to 2011, and then by Bill Hader, starting with the 2011 season), which included such family-themed films as \"National Velvet\", \"Captains Courageous\", and \"Yours, Mine and Ours\", as well as more eclectic selections, such as \"Sherlock, Jr.\", \"The Music Box\", \"Harvey\", \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", and \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\".\n\nIn 2014, the channel debuted \"Treasures from the Disney Vault\", hosted by Leonard Maltin. This block showcases a compilation of vintage Disney feature films, cartoons, documentaries, episodes of the \"Walt Disney anthology television series\", and episodes of \"The Mickey Mouse Club\".\n\nIn addition to films, Turner Classic Movies also airs original content, mostly documentaries about classic movie personalities, the world of filmmaking and particularly notable films. An occasional month-long series, \"Race and Hollywood\", showcases films by and about people of non-white races, featuring discussions of how these pictures influenced white people's image of said races, as well as how people of those races viewed themselves. Previous installments have included \"Asian Images on Film\" in 2008, \"Native American Images on Film\" in 2010, \"Black Images on Film\" in 2006 \"Latino Images on Film\" in 2009 and \"Arab Images on Film\" in 2011. The network aired the film series \"Screened Out\" (which explored the history and depiction of homosexuality in film) in 2007 and \"Religion on Film\" (focusing on the role of religion in cinematic works) in 2005. In 2011, TCM debuted a new series entitled \"\".\n\nMost of the actors appearing in most TCM films are deceased. In December 1994, TCM debuted \"TCM Remembers\", a tribute to recently deceased notable film personalities (including actors, producers, composers, directors, writers and cinematographers) that occasionally airs during promotional breaks between films. The segments appear in two forms: individual tributes and a longer end-of-year compilation. Following the recent death of an especially famous classic film personality (usually an actor, producer, filmmaker or director), the segment will feature a montage of select shots of the deceased's work.\n\nEvery December, a longer, more inclusive \"TCM Remembers\" interstitial is produced that honors all of the noted film personalities who died during the past year, interspersed with scenes from settings such as an abandoned drive-in (2012) or a theatre which is closing down and is being dismantled (2013). Since 2001, the soundtracks for these clipreels have been introspective melodies by indie artists and/or singer-songwriters such as Badly Drawn Boy (2007) or Steve Earle (2009).\n\nTCM received a 2008 Peabody Award for its dedication to film preservation and \"a continuing, powerful commitment to a central concept—the place of film in social and cultural experience\".\n\nTCM received a 2013 Peabody Award for its presentation of Mark Cousins' \"\", a 15-episode documentary about the development and advancement of the medium of motion pictures. Drawing on its exhaustive film library, TCM complemented each episode with short films and feature films from the familiar to the little-seen. The Peabody Award praised TCM's \"The Story of Film\" \"for its inclusive, uniquely annotated survey of world cinema history\".\n\nTurner Classic Movies operates a high definition simulcast feed, with programs broadcast in HD presented in an upconverted 1080i resolution format; the HD feed of the network was launched in June 2009. Initial programming was not available in native high definition and was instead upconverted from standard definition, but benefited from the greater bandwidth allocated to the channel. By November 2014, film masters meant for high definition presentation, along with Osborne and Mankiewicz-hosted continuity had transitioned to the format (though films meant to be presented in the Academy ratio or other anamorphic formats lower than 16:9 are presented as intended by the director or studio with the appropriate black boxing around the frame).\n\nThe TCM Vault Collection consists of several different DVD collections of rare classic films that have been licensed, remastered and released by Turner Classic Movies (through corporate sister Warner Home Video). These boxed set releases are of films by notable actors, directors or studios that were previously unreleased on DVD or VHS. The sets often include bonus discs including documentaries and shorts from the TCM library. The initial batch of DVDs are printed in limited quantities and subsequent batches are made-on-demand (MOD).\n\nIn October 2015, TCM announced the launch of the TCM Wineclub, in which they teamed up with Laithwaite to provide a line of mail-order wines from famous vineyards such as famed writer-director-producer Francis Ford Coppola's winery. Wines are available in 3 month subscriptions, and can be selected as reds, whites, or a mixture of both. From the wines chosen, TCM also includes recommended movies to watch with each, such as a \"True Grit\" wine, to be paired with the John Wayne film of the same name.\n\nTurner Classic Movies is available in many other countries around the world. In Canada, TCM began to be carried on Shaw Cable and satellite provider Shaw Direct in 2005. Rogers Cable started offering TCM in December 2006 as a free preview for subscribers of its digital cable tier, and was added to its analogue tier in February 2007. While the schedule for the Canadian feed is generally the same as that of the U.S. network, some films are replaced for broadcast in Canada due to rights issues and other reasons. Other versions of TCM are available in France, Greece, Middle East, Africa, Spain, Asia, Latin America, Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta. The UK version operates two channels, including a spinoff called TCM 2.\n\n\n"}

Starting in Season 3, each show featured nine competitors (one from each country in the competition). The two competitors with the highest score in the final stage moved onto one of two semi-finals. The top three from each semi-final moved to the final episode to be crowned Ultimate Beastmaster.\n\nIn addition to Sylvester Stallone hosting season 1, each country has its own set of two hosts/commentators for the competition. They are as follows:\nNot only do each pair of hosts provide color commentary for each of the 6-9 localized versions, but the foreign commentators also make appearances in each localized version, with their commentary presented by subtitles. If a contestant completes a course, all hosts' reactions are shown on screen. Furthermore, since all host booths are placed in a row on the \"Ultimate Beastmaster\" set, commentators from one localization can easily walk over into the booth of another localized version.\n\nSeason 1 premiered on Netflix on February 24, 2017. The season was filmed in Santa Clarita, California, over the course of eight nights. Felipe Camargo of Brazil was the Ultimate Beastmaster winner for placing first.\n\nPrior to the release of season 1, Netflix had already ordered and shot season 2. The second season premiered on Netflix on December 15, 2017 with contestants from the United States, Spain, France, Italy, China and India. Haibin Qu of China was crowned the Ultimate Beastmaster for placing first and completing the entire course in the final.\n\nIn February 2018 the show was renewed for a third season, consisting of nine episodes. The third season features the United States, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, South Korea, France, Italy, United Kingdom and Australia. Season 3 was released on August 31, 2018. Season 3 featured a tournament-style bracket, in which two athletes advanced from each episode to a semifinal round, then to a final round where they fought for the title of Ultimate Beastmaster. Corbin Mackin of the United Kingdom was crowned Beastmaster for placing first.\n\nJames Hibberd compares the first season of \"Ultimate Beastmaster\" to \"American Ninja Warrior\" in a mixed review of the shows. Hibberd praises \"Ultimate Beastmaster\"s \"gorgeous superstructure\" of a course, the international rivalry aspect and concise contestant profile clips, but criticizes the show's commentators and the repetitiveness of the course, the latter of which \"American Ninja Warrior\" avoids.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1090403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1090403", "title": "Yo soy Betty, la fea", "text": "Yo soy Betty, la fea\n\nYo soy Betty, la fea (\"I am Betty, the Ugly one\") is a telenovela filmed in Colombia, written by Fernando Gaitán and was produced from 25 October 1999 to 8 May 2001 by the Colombian network RCN (Radio Cadena Nacional). More than a dozen versions of the telenovela have been made in other countries due to the popularity of the plot. In the United States, both the comedy-drama hit \"Ugly Betty\" and Televisa program \"La Fea Más Bella\" are based on the Colombian soap opera.\n\nBetty, la Fea re-aired on Spanish-language U.S. network TeleFutura in January 2009. Eight years after the telenovela's original run, the highly anticipated return of the original version of \"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea\" delivered impressive ratings for the network, attracting over one million viewers, more than half a million of which were adults aged 18–49. In addition, the premiere episode doubled and in some cases nearly tripled its prior audience among all key demographics.\n\nDue to the success of re-runs aired in the United States, in June 2009, \"Yo soy Betty, la fea\" re-aired in México on Canal de las Estrellas.\n\n\"Betty, la fea\" is one of the world's most popular television shows and is considered the most famous Latin telenovela in history. It is the first telenovela to have been remade worldwide and has been regarded as bringing the telenovela to new levels of success.\n\nTaking place principally in Bogotá, Colombia, \"Betty La Fea\" is essentially a Cinderella comedy about the rise of poor, ugly Betty Pinzón and the fall of rich, handsome Armando Mendoza. Armando is a very incompetent playboy with a scheme to turn a huge profit as the new president of Eco Moda, a clothing manufacturing company. But his scheme is doomed for his faulty mathematics. Because Betty, his secretary (and economics wizard), is enamored with him, she helps Armando deceive the board of directors as he loses money and brings the company to ruin. The story has three movements: 1) Armando's foolish destruction of Eco Moda, 2) Betty's flight from the disgrace and her vacation in Cartagena where she is transformed to a beauty, and 3) Betty returned to Eco Moda, installed as new president. The structure is much like a classical symphony in three movements. The first is sonata-allegro, acted out with very fast velocity: the two themes being 1) the irrational idiocy of Armando vs the calm rationality of Betty while she fantasizes romance with Armando in her mind. The second is a slow short movement with much time spent showing parades and the like in Cartagena counterpoised vs. the degradation of disgraced Armando back in Bogotá, while Betty undergoes a transformation from ugly to beautiful. The third is the stabilization of Eco Moda under Betty's presidency ending with the marriage of Betty and Armando with the birth of their baby.\n\nBeatriz Aurora Pinzón Solano, (Betty), is an ugly but brilliant economist working as a secretary at a Colombian fashion empire, EcoModa. Betty constantly faces the scorn of Eco Moda's attractive manager-owners but proves herself indispensable to Eco Moda's new president, Armando Mendoza. She becomes Armando's accomplice in a clandestine scheme to save Eco Moda from financial ruin, part of which scheme is that Armando should seduce Betty while engaged to Marcela, an executive and stock holder of the company. But while Armando proceeds cynically to seduce a woman who is physically repugnant to him (Betty), he becomes enamored of him, and they fornicate.\n\nThough Betty has a master's degree in finance and graduated at the top of her class, she has always been unable to secure a job interview, because, she claims, her ugly photograph ruins her otherwise impressive résumé. After searching unsuccessfully for a job to match her education and experience, she applies for a position as the secretary to the president of Eco Moda, a highly successful, trendy fashion manufacturer/retailer founded by two families, the Mendozas and the Valencias. She sends her résumé to Eco Moda without a photograph, thus securing an interview.\n\nArmando Mendoza, who is Eco Moda's new president, is the handsome and stupid (though supposedly educated) son of the company's retiring co-founder Roberto Mendoza. He is engaged to Marcela Valencia (because he needs her vote to be president). Marcela is an Eco Moda executive and daughter of the deceased co-founder, Señor Valencia. Armando is in search of a new secretary and interviews both Betty and Marcela's best friend, named Patricia Fernández for the same position. He is reluctant to hire Patricia because he knows that Marcela wants her there to spy on him, given his reputation as a womanizer. Armando then interviews Betty. While he notices her \"ugliness\", he likes the idea that she is well-educated in economics. In order to please Marcela, Armando decides to hire as his new secretaries both Betty, the ugly but brilliant economist, and the very attractive but air-headed Patricia.\n\nSince Eco Moda is a fashion company that is primarily concerned with image and beauty, Patricia is seated in the lobby while Betty is seated in a large storage closet located in Armando's office, to not be shown to the public. Nevertheless, Betty continues to prove herself invaluable as she maneuvers effortlessly in the business and finance milieu, earning respect among industry insiders and the secretaries who would become her close friends, lately called \"El cuartel de las feas\" (The club of the ugly women). Betty is almost immediately enamored of love with Armando, but keeps her feelings a secret as she fantasizes about a relationship with him. She is thrilled to hear Armando say something like, \"You are the woman that I need\".\n\nAlong the way, Eco Moda falls from Armando's incompetent schemes that cause the company to lose millions of dollars, therefore putting the company into financial ruin. Out of loyalty, and love, to Armando, she helps him launch a new business in her name, which can lend money to Eco Modo and then put an embargo on the company to prevent it's creditors from foreclosing it and seizing it if Eco Modo fails. The business plan sets up a legal company named Terra Moda, legally owned by Betty. Terra Moda prevents the banks from taking over Eco Moda, because Terra Moda forecloses on Eco Modo before the other creditors. Once the summer fashion line is released, Eco Moda will be secure in their finances, and Terra Moda can be dissolved. However, Armando asks Betty for the second time to cook the books of the company in order to deceive the board by hiding it's ruined status, so he may remain in the presidency. Betty reluctantly agrees to help him with this fraud and asks her best friend, Nicolas Mora, to go along with it. Eco Moda's vice president (and Armando's best friend) Mario Calderon is the only other person at the company who knows about the business plan. However, because of how the plan works, Eco Moda has been taken over by legal process by Terra Moda, setting up Betty as the virtual owner. Mario is concerned that Betty plans to keep the company to herself after they suspect she is involved in a romantic relationship with her best friend (Nicolas Mora). He convinces Armando to make her fall in love with him for security. Armando is sure that Betty could never be so devious, but after hearing rumors about the supposedly relationship between Betty and Nicolas, he begins to worry that they will stay with the company and all its fortune. He takes Mario's advice and starts to seduce Betty, even though he is disgusted by the idea. Once the company is back in Armando's hands, he will break up with Betty and fire her.\n\nAs the weeks pass by, Betty falls more in love with Armando. In turn, Armando starts seeing past the \"ugliness\" and looks at the beautiful person that Betty is inside. He genuinely begins to fall in love with her, but keeps his feelings a secret from Mario, who constantly teases him about having to kiss the ugly girl. A couple of days before the budget meeting, Betty discovers a letter from Mario to Armando in a blue gift bag, describing details about the deception that is all disguised with chocolates and other things included in the bag. When the bag accidentally falls into her hands, the very curious Betty accidentally discovers the plan and learns of the deception. Not knowing all to react, Betty falls into a deep depression and silently cries in agony. A heart broken Betty is then discovered by a Beauty Pageant Cecilia Bolocco(who plays as herself), and tries to care for her. She is refused by Betty's sudden hate and envy for beautiful women. After insisting on helping her, Betty opens up and the two of them have a heart to heart conversation. After Cecilia leaves, Betty begins to have hope that the deception is nothing more than a joke after remembering the wonderful moments that she had with Armando. She then makes photocopies of the letter, and asks the secretaries to return the gift bag as if it was never found.\n\nWhen Armando receives a call from Mario, and he retrieves the gift bag, it is confirmed that the deception is indeed not a joke, and Betty wails silently in agony. She is devastated at how Armando could be so cruel and play with her feelings, but first decides to resign from Eco-Moda, but after a lot of thinking, she decides to play along with Armando's game. Betty first makes Armando believe she is losing feelings for him and falling in love with her childhood friend Nicholas. She begins to torment Armando by spending Eco Moda's money on a luxury car and fancy restaurants and then by spending more time with Nicholas, thus making Armando furiously jealous. After a few days of torment, tears, and fist fights (Nicholas and Armando), Betty realizes she is only making her pain worse by playing along with the game and decides to end it.\n\nShe exposes the truth of the secret business plan to his family at the meeting by presenting the real balance sheet and not the fake one. At that moment, Armando and Mario realize that she has known about their vicious plan the entire time. The families (who are also stockholders) are informed that Eco Moda is in financial ruin and that Betty is its new owner. However, Betty reveals that Terra Moda was only set up to prevent Eco Moda from going bankrupt and that she is handing back full ownership to the stockholders. Roberto Mendoza chastises Betty on her involvement in such a scheme, knowing her to be an honest woman, and she is banned from the building. Before she leaves, Armando confronts her, only to find out how much Betty was humiliated by his deception. He tries to confess his now true feelings for her, but she refuses to listen. As Betty leaves the building, Marcela suspects her as a thief and demands to know what she is hiding inside a black trash bag where she has been keeping all the fake love letters and gifts. Betty has no choice but to reveal the affair between her and Armando. Marcela is devastated and shocked but was told by Betty that their relationship was nothing more than a cruel plan to make sure she doesn't get away with the company. Marcela cancels the wedding and breaks up with Armando. Everyone, including his family, disowns him.\n\nHurt and heartbroken, Betty immediately takes a job as the assistant to a fashion icon who is in charge of the Miss Colombia Pageant. She runs to the airport to catch a flight to Cartagena. She decides to confide the whole truth to her new boss, Catalina Angel, who has also been her guardian angel and close friend throughout her hard times in Eco Moda.\n\nArmando is desperate to find Betty, but cannot. He must also deal with the fallout of the business situation Eco Moda is now in. Armando is fired and his father comes out of retirement to take over the presidential duties. The attorney realizes that Betty did not correctly turn over the business back to the stockholders, therefore Betty and Terra Moda are still the rightful owners of the company, thus preventing the bank from seizing control. Knowing that the only way to save the company is to continue with the \"business plan\" until after the summer fashion line, the stockholders have no choice but to beg Betty to come back and run the company. The only problem is that they can't find her.\n\nMeanwhile, Betty is surrounded by all the beautiful pageant ladies and has become fast friends with a gorgeous French photographer (Michel) who would later find interest in her. Catalina helps Betty come out of her shell and slowly helps Betty shed some of her ugliness. First she convinces Betty to accept an advance on her salary so that she can buy clothes that complement her figure better. The next day she takes Betty to a hair stylist and asks them to give her a more modern cut. A few days later she is taken back to the hair stylist to have her unibrow and stache waxed out and she is fixed with make up. Catalina \"accidentally\" breaks her nerdy glasses and the new pair is much more suited to her face. It seems that Betty has shed her ugliness overnight and looks quite beautiful. But then gets a call from her father saying that she needs to return to finish some business with EcoModa. Reluctantly, she returns home after finishing her work in Cartagena.\n\nWhen she walks into Eco Moda, nobody recognizes her. Everyone is quite shocked at her transformation, for example Patricia passing rumors to Marcela (\"Marcela! I hate her! She spent Eco Moda's money in facial surgery!\"). Thinking that Betty is still spending the company's money after purchasing a Mercedes-Benz (which is the luxury car like the one Patricia had, before it was repossessed and towed away from Patricia), and for the fancy restaurants. Roberto tells Betty about the critical financial situation they are in and asks Betty to help him save the company from going bankrupt. Although hesitant about working at Eco Moda once again, Betty agrees, feeling some unfortunate responsibility as to why they are in that situation. She is to be the new president of Eco Moda until the company can be financially stable again.\n\nMonths later, the new fashion line is a great success thanks to Betty's business savvy and her idea of modeling her friends (the club of the ugly women) instead of the usual, beautiful models. Although Betty appears to be dating Michel, who came to visit her from Cartagena, she is still in love with Armando but does not believe him at all when he confesses his feelings for her. Michel offers Betty to move to Cartagena with her family to work for a chain of restaurants and start a new life once she finishes her job in EcoModa. She is unsure whether to take the offer at first, but later accepts it.\n\nBetty tells her friends she is leaving Bogotá and they are all devastated by the news. In fact, she decides to leave earlier than planned in order to forget Armando forever, and by making the club of ugly women photocopy, then hand out a letter to every member of the Board Of Directors, about her resignation from Eco Moda. This puts the company back in danger because it is not yet stable. In order to prevent this, Armando decides to move far away so that Betty can stay and continue as president, without him (considered a nuisance) around. Betty's friends try convincing her to stay, truly believing that Armando has changed, but she refuses to stay and give him a chance. This means that the presidential role would go to Daniel Valencia, another executive and stockholder, who is also Marcela's brother, and Betty and Armando's rude enemy. He would sell the company and save whatever is left of it, therefore causing hundreds of people to be unemployed. When Marcela hears about this, she decides to swallow her pride and resentment and tells Betty the truth about everything that happened when she left for Cartagena, when she talked to Margarita (Armando's mother), and convinced her to not support Daniel as the new president, for fear of liquidating the company. Because of this, Betty realizes that Armando is truly a changed man, and she stops him from leaving. They both stay and run the company together and after a few months, the two eventually marry. But Armando never recovers his leadership role over Eco Moda. \n\nThe final scene shows everyone staring at Betty and Armando's new-born daughter, who possibly resembles Betty when she was first born.\n\nIn 2001, \"Yo soy Betty, la fea\" won the New York Latin ACE Award for the Best Scenic Program (\"Mejor programa escénico\") and International Female Personality of the Year (\"Figura internacional femenina del año\") to Ana María Orozco, and, also in 2002, the TP de Oro for Best Soap Opera (\"Mejor telenovela\"), and the INTE Award for Best Soap Opera and Actress of the Year (\"Actriz del año\") to Ana María Orozco.\n\n\"Betty la fea\" was created, filmed, and produced in Colombia and originally aired on RCN and was released to air on Telemundo on 2000, and on TeleFutura nine years later, in the United States. Several similar programs were created in other countries, as well as its rebroadcast in other languages around the world. The success of \"Yo soy Betty, la fea\" led to its first sequel in 2002 with Univision's release of \"Ecomoda\". Some scenes from the first episode were filmed in Buenos Aires and some scenes for the opening sequence were filmed in Miami, Florida.\n\nThe phenomenal success of \"Betty la fea\" accounts for numerous adaptations and airings around the world. The story appeals to global audiences because it is centered around the life of an unattractive character rather than that of a typical attractive character.\n\nSpinoffs include an animated series called \"Betty Toons\", featuring Betty as a child with her friends. In the U.S., \"Betty Toons\" previously aired Saturday mornings on most affiliates of the Telefutura network, as part of the \"Toonturama\" block.\n\n\"Ugly Betty\", the U.S. adaptation of Betty La Fea, aired on ABC from 2006 to 2010. The hour-long program was developed by Silvio Horta and co-produced by Salma Hayek and Ben Silverman. America Ferrera played the title role. The show has received a Golden Globe and Peabody Award.\n\n\n\nThe original Colombian version of the show has been dubbed or subbed then broadcast in India, Lithuania, Indonesia, Poland (\"BrzydUla\"), Bulgaria, Romania (\"Betty cea urâtă\"), Malaysia, Hungary (\"Betty, a csúnya lány\"), Czech Republic (\"Ošklivka Betty\"), Italy (\"Betty la cozza\"), Switzerland, Georgia (\"უშნო ბეტი\"), Japan – under the title \"Betty, Ai to uragiri no hishojitsu\" (\"Betty, The Secretarial Office of Love and Betrayal \", ベティ愛と裏切りの秘書室)–, Turkey, Philippines and China. The show was also broadcast in virtually all of Latin America plus Spain, achieving record ratings in every single country, including those where Colombian soaps do not usually achieve high ratings, such as Brazil and Mexico. Later the cast went on tour to meet fans throughout the continent.\n\n(Love is not as it looks) (2000, Azteca 13, Mexico): Vanessa Acosta as Alicia \"Licha\" Ramírez Campos. \"El amor no es como lo pintan\" concluded in 2001.\n\n(There's No One Like Jassi) (2003, SET, India): Mona Singh as Jasmeet Walia. The Indian version is not so much about beauty and ugliness, as about a simple middle class girl with strong family values being catapulted into the amoral world of high fashion upper society, although Jassi was made to appear ugly by having on thick rimmed glasses, braces and an unsightly hairstyle. \"Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin\" concluded in 2006.\n\nTurkey's \"Sensiz Olmuyor\" (Won't Work Without You) told the story of Gönül and Arda on two separate TV networks, with each channel showing thirteen episodes. When the weekly series debuted on Show TV in January 2005, Özlem Conker played Gönül (which means 'heart' in Turkish), the intelligent swan in ugly duckling clothing, and pop star Emre Altuğ appeared as her boss and love interest, Arda. The show did not go on hiatus when it was moved from Show TV to rival network Kanal D, but there was one big change: Yeliz Şar took over the role of Gönül, but the rest of the original cast remained intact.\n\nIn February 2005, the German TV network, SAT 1, began airing a version called \"Verliebt in Berlin\" (The title is a word-play and can mean either \"In Love in Berlin\" or \"In Love with Berlin\"), starring local soap opera star Alexandra Neldel as Lisa Plenske and Swiss actor Mathis Künzler as David. The show had 5 million viewers daily and was extended beyond its initial 250 episode run in early 2006.\n\nA few weeks later it was announced that the show would be renewed for a second season, but without Neldel and Künzler. The focus shifted onto a male lead character named Bruno Plenske (Lisa's half-brother, played by Tim Sander). Without Alexandra Neldel, however, the show lost much of its original appeal and dwindling ratings led to its cancellation in 2007. \"Verliebt in Berlin\" has also been broadcast in dubbed versions in Hungary (as \"Lisa csak egy van\") and France (as \"Le destin de Lisa\"). Although \"Verliebt in Berlin\" continued with new featured characters and original storylines, it is still credited as \"based on \"Yo Soy Betty La Fea\"\".\n\nIn 2005, STS broadcasting in Russia created a version of the show called \"Ne Rodis' Krasivoy\" starring Nelly Uvarova in the title role of Katya. This version was also broadcast throughout the former Soviet Union.\n\n(The Most Beautiful Ugly Woman) (2006–2007, Televisa, Mexico): Angélica Vale as Leticia Padilla Solis.\n\nThe Mexican Televisa television network, produced its version \"La Fea Más Bella\" (\"The Prettiest Ugly\"), which debuted on 23 January 2006 and ended on 25 February 2007. In the United States, the series aired on Univision, and in the Philippines it was broadcast on ABC 5, where it debuted on 24 April 2006 and concluded on 25 June 2007. It was also aired in Lebanon on the Lebanese MTV network from 2009 to 2010. In both these versions, the protagonist's nickname is \"Lety\", which is also the name of the show in Lebanon.\n\n(2006, Talpa, Netherlands): Nyncke Beekhuyzen as Lotte Pronk.\nIn 2006, the Dutch TV network Talpa began airing Lotte, starring Nyncke Beekhuyzen as the main character and Lars Oostveen as Vico Maesland.\n\nDespite the original Colombian production already being in Spanish, Telecinco launched an adaptation in Spain called \"Yo soy Bea\" in July 2006. The Spanish version title (which translates to \"I am Bea\") is a pun, with \"Bea\" sounding like both \"fea\" (\"ugly\") and \"bella\" (\"beautiful\"), and being the short version of the protagonist name, \"Beatriz\". Ruth Núñez played Beatriz Pérez Pinzón and Alejandro Tous was Álvaro Aguilar, the company boss.\n\nThe Spanish adaptation screens weekdays at 6:00 pm and pulls in an average of more than four million viewers (more than +35% share of the audience). The series' record is a 42,1% of share. It has become Spain's top-rated daytime programme. Ruth Núñez, known to Spanish viewers for her portrayal of a Yugoslav student in teen soap, \"Compañeros\", plays the heroine.\n\nIn this version, Beatriz Pérez Pinzón (Núñez) is an unattractive 26-year-old economist whose looks aren't important to her. She's intelligent and kind, and one day, after having cared for her widower father for two years, she decides to look for a job. Although she's very well educated, she gets only a secretary job at the magazine \"Bulevar 21\". She becomes the secretary of Álvaro Aguilar (Alejandro Tous), the company boss. In the company, Bea will be against Cayetana (Mónica Estarreado), Álvaro's fiancée, and her friend Bárbara (Norma Ruiz), who is also Álvaro's secretary.\nThe Spanish Version won a TP de Oro to \"La mejor telenovela\" in 2007.\n\nThe American production was broadcast on ABC in the United States from 28 September 2006 to 14 April 2010.

ABC would acquire the series under the title \"Ugly Betty\", and initially slated the program for broadcasting in summer of 2006 as a daily series, but its success led to ABC slating it as a weekly series. The hour-long program aired Fridays at 9:00 pm (Eastern time); the first episode was broadcast 28 September 2006. Actress America Ferrera portrayed the title character Betty Suarez – an unattractive, but efficient editorial assistant at a fashion magazine.\n\nMega Channel in Greece is airing its own version titled \"Maria, i Aschimi\" (\"Μαρία, Η Άσχημη\" – \"Maria, The Ugly One\")\nstarring Aggeliki Daliani and Anthimos Ananiadis . Maria exudes intelligence, humor, and kindness, but what she is missing is conventional beauty. She considers her appearance to be an obstacle in her search for employment, despite her collection of degrees, which are displayed proudly by her parents, Kaiti and Irakles. Having no luck in her job search, Maria decides to try for a job for which she is overqualified, secretary to Alexis Mantas, the director of a noted fashion house called Ecomoda. Alexis is the most coveted bachelor in Athens, but he has recently gotten engaged to Markella, who tries to get him to choose her best friend, Lilian, to be his secretary and to keep an eye on him. Lilian doesn't have Maria's natural intelligence or fine education, but she has a beautiful appearance, which makes her a better superficial fit at the fashion house.\n\nThis adaptation was originally supposed to start airing on 1 November 2006, but within two weeks of that date the show was removed from Mega Channel's schedule. Finally, it began on 1 January 2007 at 21:00 and although it was scheduled to move at 18:15 two weeks later, due to its high ratings (± 45% according to Agb Hellas and more than 2 million viewers) finally remained in the prime-time slot of the channel.\n\nThe Flemish adaptation is called \"Sara\", starring Veerle Baetens as Sara De Roose.

The show is sponsored by Unilever's Dove brand, which is woven into the plot as Wudi works on a Dove advertising campaign. The show has also been used as a way to launch Dove's Campaign for Real Beauty in China.\n\nFour seasons of Chounu Wudi have been aired in China. The 4th season started on 20 February 2010. It was named as the final season of Chounu Wudi.\n\nPoland's adaptation of the Betty story, \"BrzydUla\" (play on words: Brzydula means ugly girl but Ula is a reference to main character's name), premiered on 6 October 2008 on the TVN network. This version stars Julia Kamińska as Ula Cieplak and Marek Włodarczyk as her father, Józef. Ula works for Marek Dobrzański (played by Filip Bobek) at a prestigious Warsaw fashion house called \"Dom Mody Febo & Dobrzański\".\n\nAfter months of speculation, the Brazilian TV network Record officially announced on 22 May 2009 that Mexican-Brazilian actress Giselle Itié would portray Bela, the protagonist of the Brazilian version of \"Yo soy Betty, la Fea.\" The extensive cast included Ana Roberta Gualda, André Mattos, André Segatti, Angela Leal, Aracy Cardoso, Bemvindo Sequeira, Bia Montez, Bruno Ferrari, Bárbara Borges, Carla Regina, Cláudio Gabriel, Daniel Erthal, Denise Del Vecchio, Esther Góes, Gabriela Moreira, Henri Pagnocelli, Ildi Silva, Iran Malfitano, Jonas Bloch, João Camargo, Laila Zaid, Luiza Thomé, Marcela Barrozo, Natália Guimarães, Pérola Faria, Raul Gazolla, Simone Spoladore, Sérgio Hondjakoff, Sérgio Menezes, Sílvia Pfeifer, and Thierry Figueira, with guest appearances by Babi Xavier, Gracyanne Barbosa, Rogério Fróes, Sérgio Mallandro, and Viviane Araújo. The series was produced by Record in partnership with Mexico's Televisa, which produced \"La Fea más bella\". The story was adapted by scribe Gisele Joras and the series was directed by Edson Spinello. The novela premiered on 4 August 2009, and ended on 2 June 2010.\n\nGeorgia's version of the Betty story began on 24 May 2010, about one month after the U.S.A.'s \"Ugly Betty\" ended. The first episode was a pretty faithful remake of the pilot episode for \"Ugly Betty\", with only minor changes, making this the first series to be adapted directly from the American \"Ugly Betty\" and not the Colombian \"Yo soy Betty, la fea\". The series stars Tina Makharadze as Tamuna and takes place in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital (Tamuna lives in the outskirts, hence the show's title, which translates as \"Girl from the Suburbs\"). The first season consisted of 10 episodes and concluded on 26 July 2010. The second ran from 8 October 2010 through 31 December 2010, and consisted of 13 episodes. The second season diverged even farther from the story lines of \"Ugly Betty\" than the first season had, but many details within various episodes were directly or loosely based on details from second, third, and fourth season episodes of \"Ugly Betty\". The third season began on 11 February 2011 without the show's leading man, Tornike Gogrichiani, who played Tamuna's boss, Nika Kekelidze. Gogrichiani was absent from the season's first four episodes and it was rumored online that he may be leaving the series altogether.\n\nA story of Pet (Thai: เป็ด; meaning 'Duck') (Pratchayanan \"Babymind\" Suwanmani), a young girl who looks ugly but is very capable. She works as a secretary for Danai (Wasin \"Ko\" Atsawanaruenat), who is a young playboy and the son of CEO of POSH Inc., a high-end cosmetics company and Ngamkhae (Nicole Theriault). Danai is the new CEO but things are not as they seem, because Danai has competition from the managing directer Alisa \"Alice\" Phalakon (Sonia Couling) and the Phalakon family who holds shares of his company, Pet also has problems resulting from Danai's previous secretary, a young and beautiful woman.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39382038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39382038", "title": "Ziss Modell", "text": "Ziss Modell\n\nZiss-Modell, originally also called R. W. Modell or Wittek Modell were 'brand' names of the German Mini-Auto firm which made diecast metal classic and contemporary vehicles from the 1960s through the late 1970s. Later, use of the Mini-Auto name largely disappeared and the models were mainly known as Ziss or R. W. Modell. The company was based in Lintorf.\n\nThe company began sometime in the 1960s as the Mini-Auto Company with models called R.W. Modell - possibly for the founder E. (probably Erich) Wittek or another relative of the same family - brand nomenclature in early pamphlets is unclear. The Mini-Auto name appeared occasionally on packaging and the bases of models, but it usually appeared only in brochures (Johnson 1998, p. 254; Wittek No date). Later, about the mid-1970s, use of the name Mini-Auto disappeared in favor of only R. W. Modell or Ziss. This may have been due to confusion with other names of miniature manufacturers like Italy's Dugu Miniautotoys, the Miniauto line produced by Kaden in Czechoslovakia, or Dave Sinclair's Mini-Auto import and sales shop in Erie, Pennsylvania. \n\nFinally, R. W. Modell seems to have been changed to Ziss which may have also been a family name (some web sites say E. Wittek's son continued the operation, thus the gradual name change from R. W. to Ziss; see Robinson 2010). For a time, however, the two names were used simultaneously under the Mini-Auto or Wittek Modell appellation and some company brochures show both 'brands' on their covers. There appears to have been no specific model differentiation between the two lines. The influential U.S. importer David Sinclair, who scoured Europe for new models and got to know many of the individuals behind the companies, called the company a \"comparatively small family operation\" (Sinclair 1979, p. 392).\n\nThe company, whichever name is used, was located in Lintorf, West Germany, a town near Ratingen, north of Düsseldorf and not far from the Rhine River (Wittek No date; Rixon 2005, p. 72). R. W. and Ziss boxes commonly say \"Made in Western-Germany\" on the flaps. The company made both contemporary and veteran vehicles. That a German manufacturer would carry models from two distinct decades seems a rare treat - French companies like Minialuxe, RAMI by J.M.K. or Italian Rio Models and Brumm were ahead of any German firm in making veteran vehicles from before 1930. Except for Cursor Models which were made for the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart, and some Gama veteran cars, Ziss seems to be the only German manufacturer dedicated to making an array of models from the veteran era (Gibson 1971, p. 21).\n\nThe earliest models were a classic line of mostly German vehicles in the spirit of French RAMI by J.M.K. or Italian Rio Models (Gibson 1971, pp. 20-21). Both autos and trucks were produced, usually in three or four different colors for each model. Under the earlier R.W. name, models included the cute little 1920s Hanomag \"Kommisbrot\" (\"bread loaf\" - in top up and top down versions, like Rio and Brumm models), a 1905 Mercedes Kettenwagen, coupe and Grand Prix, a BMW Dixi, and a FIAT 508S Balilla coupe. \n\nUnder the Ziss Modell name, new marques such as Adler, Mercedes-Simplex, Audi Alpensieger, Opel, and N.A.G. appeared. New trucks appeared as well like Henschel, M.A.N. and B.V. tankers. These trucks were heavy with an unusually high metal content (Rixon 2005, p. 73). Some of the models, like selected Henschel trucks, appeared as special promotionals in distinct white boxes. Even a couple of Ford Model Ts, including a utility \"Ranch-wagen\", were made, similar to choices that the French RAMI by J.M.K. had done. It is interesting that none of the R. W. models appear to have leaked over into the Ziss line-up, showing somewhat of a break in development of models between R. W. and Ziss Modell - but about 1970 or so, both were offered simultaneously, and there appears no specific rationale for the two lines, other than a gradual name change. For Ziss at least two significantly different versions from each marque appeared, such as an Opel Stadtcoupe and an Opel Torpedo or the Adler phaeton and the Adler limousine.\n\nThough Ziss-Modell is more known for its classic line, like the French Minialuxe it also offered a few contemporary cars and trucks. From the outset, R. W. Modell made a Ford Transit van, contemporary German Hanomag stake and delivery trucks in both shorter wheelbase and longer articulated forms, a Volkswagen transporter flatbed, a tractor and a Mercedes-Benz 600 Pullman limousine. A simply cast Jeep was also available. \n\nLater Ziss offerings included an Opel Rekord II four door sedan from about 1972 with opening front doors, and a two-door Opel Commodore (Bickford 2009). An Opel Manta is mentioned by some, but the existence of this model has not been confirmed. The rather arbitrary nature of the contemporary offerings makes one wonder if they were offered mainly because of promotional contracts with Opel or Mercedes-Benz. Why not other Porsches, Audis, Volkswagens, BMWs or Mercedes-Benzes? Because Schabak had Audi and Cursor had Volkswagen and other companies covered Mercedes-Benz? Ziss models also appear to have been for special purposes.\n\nBesides the normal liveries appearing on the sides of some trucks, Ziss did some models which were promotionals for specific companies. Ziss made a rather simple diecast Jeep and one version was a marketing promotional for Wicküler beer - complete with '3 Musketeers'-like figures holding up beer steins. The Ford Transit van was offered with Funny Frisch chips logo on the sides. Various liveries appeared on the M.A.N. and Henschel trucks including British Petroleum, Aral Oil, Wicküler beer, and Schenker transport. One M.A.N. omnibus was for the Wiblingen-Ulm-Wiblingen circuit to the famed cathedral. \n\nZiss also made a few construction vehicles which were apparently used for company promotion. One example was a Clark C-500 540D forklift made in a gray-green in 1/24 scale and also a pair of O&K excavator-loaders in both wheeled and tracked versions. Also offered was a yellow P&H excavator loader, which appeared very similar to the O&K machines. A couple of tractors - an orange and gray Fiat 550, and a Deutz Series 06 were also offered in bright card boxes with photos of the tractors on the sides.\nIt seems earlier boxes were blue and labeled with the Mini-Auto name along with Wittek Modell, but this design is rare. Some R.W. Modell vehicles had red boxes with plastic windows with no illustration of the vehicle. These boxes were in German script with brief vehicle specifications. Other R.W. boxes had red and white vertical stripes on two sides with solid red on the alternate sides - with an illustration of the vehicle. Ziss Modell boxes were blue, yet decorated in the same manner as the earlier R.W. boxes. \n\nVehicles sometimes came with railings or other parts in packages with illustrations on how to affix the parts to the model. This is the case with the 1911 Benz Landaulet which came with separate, ornately curved, diecast zamac roof racks. Some of the R.W. Hanomag truck boxes were multicolored, but the striped boxes described above were most common. Some of the last vehicles in the late 1970s or possibly the early 1980s were sold in plastic display boxes.\n\nThe model selection of mainly German marques in the R.W. and Ziss line-up earns kudos, especially some in the R.W. Modell line like the Hanomag \"Kommissbrot\". This model was ultra detailed with fine features like lights, horn, opening rear engine lid, tilting seats and a spare tire behind the seats. Still, the execution and detail of some models lacked confidence. Ziss models often have a cheap looking plastic 'wooden spoke' wheel style that doesn't even look as good as Matchbox Models of Yesteryear's metal wheels. Later models offered a more realistic plastic wire wheel design. \n\nColor choice was sometimes criticized as was the rendition of Ziss lamps, grilles and other finer pieces of the models, which Gibson called \"uncomfortable\" (Gibson 1971, pp. 28-29). Another uncomfortable feature was the raised ribs for door joints on some models like the Audi Alpensieger - a ridge to give the impression of the door line is unfortunate though the same practice is also seen on Spot-On models. Still, no other diecast company before or since has offered such classic German selections. They are done well, some of them very well and are reasonably priced on the normal auction sites.\n\nMost sources say the company stopped producing about 1978 (Sinclair 1979, p. 392). Some models may have been produced into the early 1980s. Previous Ziss models appeared in the early 1980s modeled as Euro-Modell. These often blotted the molded Ziss name from the metal base of the model, but some Euro-Modell's bases still said Ziss. Whether it was Ziss with \"another\" new name or a completely different company is uncertain, but some reported that models such as the Audi Alpenseiger were sold as promotional models in contemporary Audi dealers. It is uncertain if this 'Euro-Modell' (hyphenated) was related to the more contemporary 'Euro Modell' HO (1:87 scale) plastic model producer.\n\n"}
