Toys like this have been popular since \"Pigs in Clover\" was invented by Charles Martin Crandall in the 1880s, with the patent being applied for in 1889.\n\nIn some versions a wooden labyrinth is tilted using two knobs and the ball has to be navigated past a series of holes and obstacles. A magnet is used in other versions where the balls have to be manipulated rather than the maze. Perplexus is an example of a 3D ball-in-a-maze. Recently a large number of virtual versions have become available.\n\nAnother version, usually molded in transparent plastic, uses the ball as a key to opening an internal compartment by manipulating the ball into position, and then operating a sliding mechanism that releases an access door. They are sometimes called \"Money Maze\" banks or puzzle boxes.\n\n"}

The story was based on the Barbie and the Rockers line of dolls, which featured Barbie as the leader of a rock band. The special originally aired in syndication as a two-part television \"miniseries\" with each installment lasting approximately 25 minutes; part two was titled \"\". The miniseries was supposed to have been the pilot for a Monday–Friday Barbie cartoon series. However, negotiations between DIC and Mattel fell through, and the project eventually emerged with a whole new set of characters—and the sponsorship of Mattel rival Hasbro—as Maxie's World in 1988. The story was based on the Barbie and the Rockers doll line in which Barbie is the lead singer of a rock band. The two-part special was later released on video as a single film by Hi-Tops Video.\n\nBarbie's rock band completes a successful world tour and decides to perform one last concert in space to promote world peace.

In Poker they are blanks, bricks or bombs. In the German games of Schafkopf, Doppelkopf, Sixty-six and Skat, the 7s, 8s and 9s in all card suits are \"Luschen\". In the popular Swiss game of Jass the \"Luschen\" are the 6s, 7s, 8s and 9s; unlike Skat, however, the 9 of trumps, \"Nell\", is worth 14 points and is thus an exception; it ranks in the hierarchy immediately below the highest trump card, the Jack or Unter of Trumps (20 points) and above the Ace of Trumps (11 points). In most versions of Schafkopf, the 6s are also blanks. There are no blanks in games like Whist or Bridge, because they are plain-trick games where it is the number of tricks that counts, not the value of the cards won.\n\nSimilar nicknames are given to very low-scoring cards. For example, in Tarock games, tarocks and pip cards score 1/3 of a point and are called \"Glatzen\" or \"Glatz'n\", \"Skartindeln\", \"Skatindeln\" or \"Skartins\"; and suit cards other than court cards are also called \"Ladons\", \"Latons\" or \"Ladonis\".

{"id": "32624790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32624790", "title": "Borderlands 2", "text": "Borderlands 2\n\nBorderlands 2 is an open world action role-playing first-person shooter video game developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. It is the second game in the \"Borderlands\" series and the sequel to 2009's \"Borderlands\". The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and OS X on September 18, 2012. It was ported to the PlayStation Vita on May 13, 2014, and released for Linux on September 30, 2014.\n\n\"Borderlands 2\" allows players to complete a campaign consisting of central quests and optional side-missions as one of four (six including downloadable content) treasure seekers, \"Vault Hunters\", on the planet Pandora. Key gameplay features from its predecessor, such as online collaborative campaign gameplay, randomly generated loot, such as weapons and shields and character-building elements commonly found in role-playing video games are in \"Borderlands 2\".\n\nThe game received critical acclaim and was a commercial success. Downloadable content for the game was released, including new characters and storylines. The Game of the Year Edition of the game was released on October 8, 2013 in the U.S. and October 11 internationally, including all the previous downloadable and upgrade packs except for the new campaign. A PlayStation Vita version was released in May 2014, and was developed by Iron Galaxy Studios in collaboration with Gearbox. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports of \"Borderlands 2\" and its DLC were released as part of \"\" on March 24, 2015. \"Borderlands 2\" had sold over 13 million copies, making it 2K's highest-selling title.\n\n\"Borderlands 2\" is an action role-playing game played from a first-person perspective. The gameplay revolves around the completion of missions and the collection of randomly generated \"loot\" (such as weapons, shields, skins, and other items) with various rarities, statistics, and elemental effects. Four playable character classes are available in the base game, each with their own unique abilities and skill trees: Axton, \"the Commando\", can summon a turret to provide offensive support. Maya, \"the Siren\", can \"phaselock\" enemies by trapping them in a sphere of energy for a few seconds. Zer0, \"the Assassin\", can temporarily become invisible and spawn a hologram decoy to distract enemies; an attack delivered in this state provides bonus damage. Salvador, \"the Gunzerker\", can use his titular ability to temporarily dual-wield weapons.\n\nNew gameplay elements added to \"Borderlands 2\" include a trading system during multiplayer play; slag, a substance that increases damage to targets that are covered in it; new \"E-Tech\" weaponry; Eridium bars, a new currency for purchasing storage upgrades and other premium items; and the \"Secret Stash,\" a small storage area for transferring items between characters. Increased character customization options are also made available, with collectable items unlocking different character head designs, color schemes, and vehicle paint schemes. A major addition to the game is the \"Badass Rank\" system; points are awarded for completing various in-game challenges, which in turn award tokens that can be redeemed to increase the player's base stats. These stat improvements apply to all of a single player's characters.\n\nSimilarly to the original, completing the main story campaign unlocks \"True Vault Hunter Mode\", a New Game Plus which increases the difficulty of the game by making enemies stronger, accordingly improves the probability of finding rare and higher-quality items, and allows the player's character to reach level 50. There is also an \"Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode\" that spawns more difficult enemies and also increases the probability of rare item drops. This mode also raises the level cap to level 61 (72 with an additional DLC pack, The Raid on Digistruct Peak).\n\nLike its predecessor, \"Borderlands 2\" features four playable characters: Axton the Commando, Maya the Siren, Salvador the Gunzerker, and Zer0 the Assassin. New to \"Borderlands 2\" are two additional characters available as downloadable content: Gaige the Mechromancer and Krieg the Psycho.\n\nThe four player characters from the first game, Roland, Lilith, Brick, and Mordecai, return in the form of non-player characters that the new characters will encounter on Pandora, or in various missions. Other characters like the Guardian Angel and Claptrap return to aid the player during quests. Characters from the first game such as Scooter the mechanic, Dr. Zed, Marcus the guns and ammo merchant, Mad Moxxi, and the insane archaeologist Patricia Tannis join new faces such as the cyborg Sir Hammerlock and Scooter's sister Ellie as quest giving characters.\n\nFive years have passed since the events of \"Borderlands\", when the four Vault Hunters, Roland, Mordecai, Lilith, and Brick were guided by a mysterious entity known as \"The Guardian Angel\" on the planet of Pandora to the Vault, a mysterious alien structure that was rumored to hold ancient and exotic technology and riches. Instead, these Vault Hunters were confronted by an alien abomination known as \"The Destroyer\" inside the Vault. After defeating The Destroyer, a valuable mineral called \"Eridium\" started flourishing through Pandora's crust. Handsome Jack, the president of the Hyperion Corporation, secures this new resource and makes use of it to attempt to \"bring peace\" to the planet. Now, Handsome Jack rules over the inhabitants of Pandora with an iron fist from his massive satellite built in the shape of an \"H\", always visible in the sky in front of Pandora's moon. Meanwhile, rumors of an even larger Vault hidden on Pandora spread across the galaxy, drawing a new group of Vault Hunters to the planet in search of it.\n\nThe four Vault Hunters are betrayed by Jack during a job and left for dead in a frozen wasteland. The Vault Hunters are found by the last remaining Hyperion CL4P-TP (\"Claptrap\") unit. The Guardian Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and instructs them to accompany Claptrap to the city of Sanctuary, and to join the Crimson Raiders, an anti-Hyperion resistance movement, in order to defeat Handsome Jack.\n\nUpon arriving at the gates of Sanctuary, the Vault Hunters are asked to rescue Roland, now leader of the Crimson Raiders, who has been captured by a bounty hunter called the Firehawk. The Vault Hunters meet the Firehawk, who turns out to be Lilith (an existing and playable character in \"Borderlands\"), whose powers as a Siren have been significantly enhanced by the new supply of eridium. Lilith informs the Vault Hunters that Roland was actually captured by a group of bandits. After fighting through the bandits' territory, the Vault Hunters rescue Roland and return to Sanctuary.\n\nRoland and Lilith learn that the Vault Key is being transported aboard a Hyperion train, and ask the Vault Hunters to retrieve it. To accomplish the mission, the Vault Hunters enlist the aid of former Vault Hunter Mordecai, and of Tiny Tina, a psychotic explosives-obsessed thirteen-year-old. The Vault Hunters derail the train, but instead of finding the Vault Key, they encounter Wilhelm, a powerful Hyperion cyborg. After Wilhelm's defeat, the Vault Hunters recover his power core, which Roland recommends be used as the power source for Sanctuary's shields. The power core turns out to be a trap; it allows the Guardian Angel, who is actually working for Jack, to lower the city's shields and render it vulnerable to a bombardment from the Hyperion moon satellite. Lilith saves Sanctuary, which was originally a large spacecraft, by activating its engines and teleporting it away; for the rest of the game, Sanctuary exists as a flying city in the sky.\n\nJack's plan is to open Pandora's second Vault and unleash The Warrior, a powerful lava, eridium, and rock creature controlled by whoever releases it; knowing that the key only charges itself once every 200 years, he uses Angel to forcefully charge the Vault Key. Angel communicates with the group in Sanctuary, and despite hostile treatment from Roland, divulges that the Vault Key is kept with her in a Hyperion facility. She also shares information about the formidable defenses of the facility. The Vault Hunters embark upon a series of missions in order to assemble what is needed to overcome these defenses, including obtaining an upgrade for Claptrap, visiting the Hyperion city of Opportunity, and enlisting the aid of Brick, now leader of the Slab clan of bandits. During the process, Mordecai's pet bird Bloodwing is captured and killed by Handsome Jack; an enraged Mordecai vows revenge and joins the other three former Vault Hunters at Sanctuary. Roland and the Vault Hunters assault the Hyperion compound and meet Angel, who is not only a real person, but a siren, and Handsome Jack's daughter. She requests to be killed in order to stop her father from charging the Vault Key and gaining control of The Warrior. Handsome Jack sends in waves of security forces in order to protect his daughter, but ultimately, Roland and the Vault Hunters, with the help of late arrival Lilith, successfully kill Angel. An enraged Handsome Jack teleports in, kills Roland, and captures Lilith, whom he forces to resume charging the Vault Key in Angel's stead. Lilith manages to teleport the Vault Hunters out of the facility and back to Sanctuary.\n\nMordecai and Brick decide to learn the location of the second Vault and confront Handsome Jack and The Warrior. While the Vault Hunters travel to the Hyperion Information Annex and obtains the Vault's location, the two steal a Hyperion ship. The Vault Hunters approach on foot, battling elite Hyperion security forces, while Brick and Mordecai are shot down but left alive. Ultimately, the Vault Hunters confront, battle, and defeat Handsome Jack himself but arrive too late to prevent him from opening the Vault. Handsome Jack summons The Warrior, a gargantuan dragon-like lava creature, and orders it to kill the Vault Hunters. After a long battle, the Vault Hunters defeat the Warrior and either execute Handsome Jack or leave the task to Lilith in the aftermath.\n\nBrick and Mordecai arrive just as Lilith attempts to destroy the Vault Key. However, she accidentally activates a secret information bank containing a huge map of the galaxy with several Vaults marked on it. Lilith remarks that \"there ain't no rest for the wicked\" before the screen cuts to black.\n\nFollowing the unexpected success of the first \"Borderlands\", which sold between three to four-and-a-half million copies since release, creative director Mike Neumann stated that there was a chance of a \"Borderlands 2\" being created, adding that the decision \"seems like a no-brainer.\" On August 2, 2011, the game was confirmed and titled as \"Borderlands 2\", with Anthony Burch announced as the writer the next day. The first look at the game was shown at Gamescom 2011, and an extensive preview was included in the September edition of \"Game Informer\" magazine, with \"Borderlands 2\" being the cover story. Like the first game, \"Borderlands 2\" was developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games, running on a heavily modified version of Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3. The game was released on September 18, 2012 in North America and on September 21, 2012 internationally.\n\nGearbox revealed that they would be honoring a late fan of the game, cancer victim Michael John Mamaril, with the addition of an NPC named after Michael in the sequel. Additionally, Gearbox posted a eulogy to Mamaril in the voice of the game character, Claptrap.\n\nControversy regarding sexism hit a month before the game's scheduled release after Gearbox designer John Hemingway told Eurogamer: \"The design team was looking at the concept art and thought, you know what, this is actually the cutest character we've ever had. I want to make, for the lack of a better term, the girlfriend skill tree. This is, I love \"Borderlands\" and I want to share it with someone, but they suck at first-person shooters. Can we make a skill tree that actually allows them to understand the game and to play the game? That's what our attempt with the Best Friends Forever skill tree is.\" Gearbox Software president Randy Pitchford responded to the controversy on Twitter, saying \"There is no universe where Hemmingway is a sexist - all the women at Gearbox would beat his and anyone else's ass.\" Randy Pitchford also tweeted: \"I'm sure Hemmingway is getting noogied now, but not his fault. A personal anecdote has been twisted and dogpiled on by sensationalists.\"\n\nOn August 20, 2012, it was announced that a four issue \"Borderlands\" comic would be released in November 2012 to tie in with \"Borderlands 2\". The miniseries was written by Mikey Neumann and published by IDW. It tells the story of how the original four Vault Hunters came to be together at the beginning of \"Borderlands\", filling in their backstory and setting up the events of both games.\n\nClaptrap appears as an opponent in the crossover title \"Poker Night 2\", with players able to unlock new \"Borderlands 2\" content upon the completion of certain objectives.\n\nA 4.6 GB portion of \"Borderlands 2\" became available for pre-load through Steam on September 14, 2012, allowing customers to download encrypted game files to their computer before the game was released. When the game was released, customers were able to unlock the files on their hard drives and play the game immediately, without having to wait for the whole game to download. \"Borderlands 2\" was also available for download on the PlayStation Network on its release date for retail price.\n\nOn January 20, 2015, Gearbox announced that it would release \"\"—a port of \"Borderlands 2\" and \"\" for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, on March 24, 2015.\n\nSince its release, several PC patches have been published to address technical issues and improve overall gameplay. On November 13, 2012, patch 1.2.0 was released to fix several game issues such as the infinite golden key glitch. The most significant of these is the overpowered \"The Bee\" shield which was given reduced capabilities and effectiveness. A patch later added a colorblind mode to the game.\n\nAspyr handles porting \"Borderlands 2\" patches for the Mac and has stated there will be a delay on synchronizing new patches from Gearbox Software. When the versions are out of sync, Mac users will be unable to join or host games with PC players until both games are on the same version.\n\nGolden Keys are a part of Gearbox's SHiFT rewards program. Codes are released on various social media sites that can be redeemed in the \"Borderlands 2\" main menu for Golden Keys. These open the special Golden Chest that is located in the travel station in Sanctuary. When opened, the chest randomly produces rare equipment of the redeeming player's level.\n\nOn October 9, 2018, a port of the game was announced for PlayStation VR, to be released December 14, 2018. It is one of few major games from the pre-VR era to have a VR version made.\n\nFour major packs of downloadable content (DLC) and multiple smaller pieces of content have been made available for \"Borderlands 2\". The \"Borderlands 2 Season Pass\" allows users who purchase it to access the first four major DLC packs at a reduced cost compared to purchasing them separately as soon as they become available. Also available are two additional character classes (Gaige the Mechromancer and Krieg the Psycho), an additional area known as the \"Creature Slaughter Dome\", the \"Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack\" which raises the level cap and multiple heads and skins for character customization. A \"Game of the Year Edition\" containing the main game, all four major DLC packs, the two character packs, and the first Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack was released on October 8, 2013.\n\n\"Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty\" is the first post-release downloadable content pack and includes new campaign content. The content was released on October 16, 2012. The storyline takes place in a vast desert that used to be an ocean. Captain Scarlett, a sand pirate captain, works with the player to search for Captain Blade's Lost Treasure of the Sands, whilst repeatedly informing the player that she will eventually betray them. It also introduces new raid bosses like \"Hyperius the Invincible\" and a new hovering vehicle, the Sandskiff, which can only be driven in the DLC areas.\n\nThe pack received mixed reviews. IGN called it \"a good add-on that doesn't quite live up to expectations\", criticising the large number of fetch quests and enemies very similar to the ones found in standard \"Borderlands 2\". However Kotaku called it 'new and exciting', praising the story and the new vehicle.\n\n\"Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage\" is the second downloadable content pack and was released on November 20, 2012. The campaign's plot is centered around a new Vault discovered in Pandora buried in the center of the \"Badass Crater of Badassitude\" that will only open \"once the champion of Pandora feeds it the blood of the ultimate coward\". To find this \"champion\", Mr. Torgue, spokesman of the Torgue weapons manufacturer, sets up a tournament in which the player character can compete. It features appearances by Tiny Tina and Mad Moxxi. The new areas also feature a new weapons vending machine, which sells high-end Torgue weapons exclusively and use a new currency called Torgue Tokens. The characters and storyline of \"Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage\" bear a strong resemblance to those found in World Championship Wrestling, and Mr. Torgue in particular was interpreted as an homage to wrestler \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage.\n\nThe pack received positive to mixed reviews. Joystiq reported the pack's quest to be unexciting and in some cases \"downright weak\". However it praised the character of Mr. Torgue, referring to him as \"interesting and breathtaking\". Kotaku found it less entertaining than the previous DLC, criticising the repetitive side quests, but ultimately stated that it was \"still an entertaining experience that I'm happy to sink more hours into the game for\". However, Vincent Ingenito of IGN stated that \"everything you love about \"Borderlands 2\" is here in abundance\", praising the \"breakneck pace\" of the action and length of the campaign.\n\n\"Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt\" is the third downloadable campaign add-on and was released on January 15, 2013. The title, screenshots, and details were leaked on December 14, 2012. It chronicles side character Sir Hammerlock going on a quest to find rare animals of Pandora and his battle with former Hyperion scientist professor Nakayama, who is attempting to create a clone of Handsome Jack.\n\nThe pack received mixed reviews. IGN found it to be the \"weakest add-on Gearbox has put on the table for \"Borderlands 2\" thus far\", criticising unfunny dialogue and the new enemy the Witch Doctor, noting that it is \"exhausting to the point you're better off saving time and ammunition by running away\". They ultimately gave the pack 6.9/10. David Hinkle of Joystiq found the pack to have \"dashed expectations\", heavily criticising Nakayama and the quest design. However conversely, Hinkle praised the Witch Doctors, noting that \"aren't unfairly tough, making them perfect for those late-game battles\".\n\n\"Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep\" was the fourth piece of downloadable content and final part to be released for free for Season Pass holders. It was released for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users on June 25, 2013.\n\nThe campaign is set within the world of a tabletop role-playing game known as \"Bunkers and Badasses\", with Tiny Tina serving as a game master, sometimes deciding to modify the game world to add in a boss, an enemy or a NPC. The world is fantasy-themed, with skeletons, orcs, treants (similar to J. R. R. Tolkien's Ents) and dragons featuring as enemies, along with appearances by other \"Borderlands\" characters as residents in this world (such as Handsome Jack, who is portrayed as its villain, the Handsome Sorcerer). The campaign's frame story surrounds Tiny Tina's struggle to accept the death of Roland.\n\n\"Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep\" was met with praise and acclaim from multiple gaming websites and journalists such as IGN.com's Vince Ingenito, who gave the expansion a 9.2 out of 10, praising its use of the fantasy elements in its narrative, humorous references to the source material, and sheer amount of content, but stated that there was not a good variety of loot to be had from fighting the endgame bosses. Despite this minor issue with the pack, IGN.com scored it much higher than the previous entry, \"Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt\". Despite the acclaim surrounding the pack, there have been mixed reviews as well, such as the review written by Christian Donlan for Eurogamer.net, giving the expansion a 7 out of 10, one point lower than their review of \"Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt\", stating that \"Without spoiling anything: does it work? Not entirely. But it is, unsurprisingly, just the kind of trick one of those special long-running TV shows might try to pull now and then – a bit of heavy-handed schmaltz to break up the glib anarchy, a lunge at tonal variation to bring depth to some increasingly harshly delineated cast members.\" Despite the mixed feelings towards the narrative and themes of the pack, Donlan's review also praised the humor and entertainment value of the pack, stating that \"New U stations now babble about necromancy, loot chests can hide mimics and often come with many-sided dice stuck on top, there's a really great joke about punching stuff, and you're carried through it all by that endless ebb and flow between shooting things and picking over their corpses. Is Dragon's Keep fun but lacking surprises?\".\n\nGearbox planned to release three \"Headhunter Packs\" by the end of 2013. The first was called \"T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest\", bringing back the character last seen in \"Borderlands\"s \"Zombie Island of Dr. Ned\" DLC. Zombie T.K. Baha sends players to fight Jaques O'Lantern, a giant pumpkin boss who gives new character customizations as a reward for being beaten. It was released on October 22, 2013.\n\nThe second Headhunter Pack was released on November 26, 2013 . It is a parody of \"The Hunger Games\" and Thanksgiving day in which players have to compete in a tournament organised by Mr. Torgue and defeat a giant turkey monster.\n\nThe third additional \"Headhunter Pack\" was released on December 17, 2013. It is about finding Marcus's missing gun shipment train while saving the ex-bandit town of Gingerton from the evil snowman Tinder Snowflake.\n\nThe fourth Headhunter Pack was released on February 11, 2014. It is about Mad Moxxi's plan to have two Goliaths, one from the Zafords and one from the Hodunks, to marry and end the war between their families. A spin on the Shakespearean tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\", it also features new weather effects and some new enemies.\n\nThe fifth, and final Headhunter Pack was released on April 15, 2014. In the DLC, Sir Hammerlock, Brick, Mordecai, and Lilith are on a vacation on Wam Bam Island, large monster kidnaps Hammerlock. The DLC culminates in a battle against Crawmerax Jr., the son of the great crab worm from the original game's \"The Secret Armory of General Knoxx\" add-on, who is seeking vengeance on Roland, Lilith, Brick and Mordecai. The plot introduces Sparky Flynt, son of the boss character Captain Flynt who, along with five other people whose family and friends have been killed by the six new Vault Hunters and seek revenge. Before they can be introduced in person, separate allies of the Vault Hunters kill (or in Salvador's case, arrange the death of) the five would-be assassins, before Sparky is killed by the Vault Hunters themselves.\n\nThe \"Premiere Club\" was a pre-order bonus that comes with golden guns, a relic, a golden key and early access to a fifth playable class, the Mechromancer. The golden key can be redeemed in-game to open a special, golden chest that includes rare guns, shields, or mods. On October 9, 2012, it became publicly available as a downloadable content pack. As of October 17, it was renamed as the \"Mechromancer Pack\".\n\nThe Mechromancer, later revealed to be named Gaige, was first revealed at PAX East 2012 and planned as post-release downloadable content for October 16, 2012, but was released on all platforms a week earlier.\n\nOn March 23, 2013, Gearbox announced two new downloadable content packs for \"Borderlands 2\", only one of which is part of the Season Pass. The first pack is called the \"Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade Pack\". It adds a level cap raise from 50 to 61 and a new game mode called the Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode. This is a third playthrough mode that supersedes playthrough 2.5 and scales all enemies to level 50-61. It became available on April 2, 2013. It comes as a free download for all players who purchased the Season Pass.\n\nThe second pack, the \"Psycho Pack\", contains a sixth playable character for \"Borderlands 2\" - a Psycho named Krieg. Psychos are psychotic enemies fought during the main \"Borderlands 2\" campaign. He is a primarily melee focused character with an action skill called \"Buzz Axe Rampage\", which boosts his melee damage and causes him to regain health whenever he kills an enemy. It was released on May 14, 2013 and is not included in the Season Pass.\n\nReleased on September 3, 2013, the DLC increases the level cap from 61 to 72 and introduces the \"Digistruct Peak Challenge\", a new map where Patricia Tannis will let players fight high-level enemies (which can be over-leveled to \"impossible\") to earn new loot. A free update prior to the DLC's release has added additional backpack, ammo and bank slots, to be purchased from the black market. This is not included in the Season Pass.\n\n\"Borderlands 2\" was met with critical acclaim. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 91/100, the PC version 89/100 and the Xbox 360 version 89/100. IGN awarded the game a 9.0 out of 10, praising the game's sense of humor, world structure, and role-playing systems, while feeling disappointed by the game's lack of meaningful visual customization and the sharing of loot during co-op play. They stated that the game had roughly 30 hours of gameplay, and was worth playing multiple times. IGN also nominated the game as one of its ten finalists for Game of the Year 2012. Game Informer gave the game a score of 9.75 out of 10, claiming that the game is one of \"the most rewarding gaming experiences\" of the current console generation. \"Borderlands 2\" would go on to win X-Play's game of the year.\n\n\"Borderlands 2\" was one of the best-selling games of 2012, and has become the best-selling game in the history of 2K Games, with 8.5 million copies sold by February 2014. The following month, it was announced by Gearbox that the game had sold \"well over\" 12 million copies. As of August 2015, the game has sold over 13 million copies, making it 2K's highest-selling title.\n\n\"Borderlands 2\" was nominated for five awards at the 2012 Spike TV Video Game Awards: \"Best Xbox 360 Game\", \"Best PS3 Game\", \"Best Shooter\", \"Best Multiplayer Game\", and \"Best DLC\" (Psycho Pack). Actor Dameon Clarke was also nominated in the \"Best Performance By a Human Male\" category for his role as Handsome Jack. Finally, Claptrap was included in the viewer's choice \"Character of the Year\" category.\n\"Borderlands 2\" would go on to win \"Best Shooter\", \"Best Multi-Player Game\", \"Best Performance by a Human Male\", and \"Character Of The Year\".\n\"Borderlands 2\" wound up with five D.I.C.E. Awards nominations at the 16th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, including \"Game of the Year\", \"Action Game of the Year\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Online Gameplay\", and \"Outstanding Achievement in Character\" for the characterization of Tiny Tina. At the ceremony, the game won only one award for 2012's \"Action Game of the Year\".\n\nThe PlayStation Vita port received mixed reviews. While complimented for offering the entire game and additional content on a handheld console, the port was generally panned for its decreased graphics and sound quality, lag issues and inconsistent frame rates, and that it only offered two-player multiplayer rather than four. IGN gave the port a 5.4 out of 10, concluding that \"its compromised visuals rob it of much of its bombastic charm, while its erratic performance and unreliable touch controls keep the gameplay from shining like it has in the past.\"\n\nGearbox CEO Randy Pitchford stated in February 2014 that there were no plans for a third, main installment in the franchise; the company believed that a sequel to \"Borderlands 2\" would have to be \"massive\", but that \"when you think of what \"Borderlands 3\" should be... No, we don't know what that is yet. We can imagine what it must achieve, but we don't know what it is yet.\" However, the company still believed that there was an audience for new \"Borderlands\" content; in April 2014, Gearbox announced that 2K Australia was developing a game set in between the events of the first two \"Borderlands\" games, \"\", released October 14, 2014. The game focuses on the rise of Handsome Jack, and features four of his henchmen—Athena (from \"The Secret Armory of General Knoxx\" DLC), Claptrap, Nisha (Lynchwood's sheriff from \"Borderlands 2\"), and Wilhelm (a Hyperion engineer who was a boss in \"Borderlands 2\")—as playable characters.\n\nAt a panel during PAX South in January 2015, Pitchford announced that the studio was preparing to begin work on a new \"Borderlands\" game—which he described as \"the big one\", and began to offer a number of new staff openings related to the game. The game will be developed specifically for eighth-generation consoles such as the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Randy Pitchford confirmed at the April 2016 PAX East convention that a \"Borderlands\" sequel will be Gearbox's next game after \"Battleborn\", though he is not sure if it will be called \"Borderlands 3\". Pitchford and Randy Varnell said they would put Easter eggs to the next \"Borderlands\" in the DLC for \"Battleborn\".\n"}

{"id": "3177392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3177392", "title": "Chequebook journalism", "text": "Chequebook journalism\n\nChequebook journalism () is the controversial practice of news reporters paying sources for their information. In the U.S. it is generally considered unethical, with most mainstream newspapers and news shows having a policy forbidding it. In contrast, tabloid newspapers and tabloid television shows, which rely more on sensationalism, regularly engage in the practice. In Britain and throughout Europe, journalists paying for news is fairly common.\n\nAmong the reasons cited for why it is unethical to pay a source, one is that it can easily affect the credibility of the information the source provides. Since paying a source creates a legal business relationship, it can also affect a journalist’s ability to remain objective. The payments are typically for exclusive rights to publish personal information or obtain an interview, which for some news events, leads to bidding wars among the media for access. It also creates a potential conflict of interest by the publisher, whose neutrality should always be protected. Or it may give the source an incentive to embellish or exaggerate, and even fabricate details, since part of the bargain with the reporter is to provide them interesting and valuable information.\n\nIn the past, checkbook journalism became an issue after certain news events regarding celebrities and politicians, as they earn the publication substantial income. The promise of high profits makes them more willing to pay for information. Examples would include stories about Michael Jackson, Bill Clinton, O. J. Simpson, Princess Diana, and Richard Nixon, where sources were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for interviews. Defenders of the practice consider news information to be a commodity, which a source has a right to sell to a reporter for the highest price, in the same way the publication sells its news to the public. When payments to a source became disclosed to the public, however, it has even undermined court cases, as when witnesses admitted they had been paid for providing confidential information to the press about the case.\n\nSome hazards of checkbook journalism have become more common, as the practice has made celebrities and politicians a lucrative target for tabloids, and a form of public voyeurism which attracts viewers. In situations where a source has been paid for making unproven allegations against a public figure, the mere publication of a story about it has damaged numerous careers, regardless of whether the alleged offense actually took place. A number of well-known journalists, such as Walter Cronkite, have suggested forcing disclosure of any payments to be part of the news story.\n\nCheckbook journalism is the practice of paying money or other consideration to news sources, usually people, by reporters or news agencies, in exchange for the right to publish their story in a newspaper, magazine or on television. The rights purchased are often for exclusive rights, thereby allowing only a single news publisher the right to reproduce, edit, resell, televise, or use the story as they choose. The practice may include having the source grant an interview and provide personal and private information.\n\nThe Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), an organization formed to maintain high ethical standards of behavior in the practice of journalism, states that journalists should not pay for access to news. Their guidelines also suggest being wary of sources offering news information for compensation. By avoiding paying for news, according to the SPJ, journalists will be able to act independently, avoid bidding for news, and will prevent any conflict of interest. Competition for getting a story does not give a journalist license to cross ethical boundaries.\n\nMost news outlets disapprove of paying for news or else ban the practice outright as a policy. Among the reasons for those policies, according to Andy Schotz, chairman of the SPJ's ethics committee, is that paying for an interview immediately puts the credibility of the information they provide in doubt. In addition, paying sources creates a legal business relationship, thereby casting doubt on the reporter's ability to maintain total objectivity, with no bias. As such, it can lead to a conflict of interest when publishing news stories. Journalism should strive to remain neutral and unbiased, according to journalism expert Roy Peter Clark.\n\nThe controversial aspects of checkbook journalism have been debated by those strongly against the practice and those who support it, at least in certain situations. For example, the imprisonment in 2016 of Tara Brown and Stephen Rice, considered two of Australia’s finest reporters, came about during production of a \"60 Minutes\" story concerning the recovering of abducted children. In supporting such payments on occasions, such as that one, an editor with \"The Daily Telegraph\" notes that \"sometimes there are individuals who simply won’t speak without being paid.\"\n\nSchotz suggests full disclosure by news publishers, one that their readers or viewers will understand. He states, \"If there's a conflict of interest, then what should come next is explaining it in detail, letting viewers know you had a separate relationship other than just that of a journalist and a source.\" Schotz's advice for aspiring journalists:\nDon't pay for interviews. Don't give sources gifts of any kind. Don't try to exchange something of value in return for getting a source's comments or information or access to them. Journalists and sources shouldn't have any other relationship other than the one involved in gathering news.\n\nWalter Cronkite likewise suggested that journalists should be forced to disclose the amount of any payment given to sources. That would include incorporating that detail in printed stories and on televised news programs. Some newspapers or TV shows have taken the step of raising the issue of how much money was paid to the source by a competing media, and publishing the amount paid, with the goal of casting doubt on their competitor's version of the story. That methodology was apparent when \"A Current Affair\" announced a new policy of no longer paying for stories, and blowing the whistle on competitor shows that do.\n\nIn at least one court case, the simple refusal by the person alleging an injury to answer whether or not they were paid by a publisher for their story, helped undermine their credibility and contributed to their case being lost.\n\nThere are some journalists and publications which have defended the practice of checkbook journalism. Among their rationales are that information is a commodity, giving the source an ownership or property right to their story; that since the news publication earns money from the story, the source has a right to a share of it; that the source has a right of privacy over their story, which they can sell if they choose; that a source should be rewarded for their time in being interviewed; or that payments received by the source can be used to cover their legal fees or other expenses related to the story. \n\nThe exchange of money or other consideration in return for news information has been practiced in small and big ways, both good and bad. While checkbook journalism has historically been used by tabloid newspapers, it has more recently been used by major news organizations or agencies along with the mainstream media. \n\nCheckbook journalism became a national controversy in 1994 after it became public that the National Enquirer, a tabloid newspaper, had offered to pay $1 million for an interview with O.J. Simpson’s friend Al Cowlings, before Simpson's murder trial. At the trial itself, the judge also had to admonish all attorneys to keep their witnesses away from the press to protect the \"integrity\" of their testimony. When the judge learned that \"Hard Copy\" and \"Star\" tabloids paid a potential witness an estimated $100,000 to be interviewed, she eliminated the potential witness from the trial, potentially affecting the outcome of the case. The hounding of potential witnesses by the media led California Governor Pete Wilson to immediately sign a bill which henceforth made it illegal for witnesses and jurors in criminal trials to sell their stories until the case is finished.\n\nHoward Kurtz is among many journalists who states that paying for news stories, which he says was \"essentially invented by the London tabloids,\" raises questions about their credibility. Writer Andrea Gerlin notes that the circulation wars among British newspapers has over the years led to rounds of \"media witch-hunts, checkbook journalism, and intrusive stories about celebrities.\"\n\nNewspaper columnist Art Buchwald said that \"the days of cheap news are over, and now all the players have agents.\" Consequently, newspapers which engage in checkbook journalism have to put up a lot more money than they used to. The witnesses in the Michael Jackson scandal were charging more to tell their story to the media than he was paid to give a concert. \"Freedom of the press is much more costly than the public realizes.\"\n\nCheckbook journalism has existed in the U.S. for over a hundred years. In 1912 \"The New York Times\" paid a wireless operator on the \"Titanic\" $1,000 for his story; \"Life\" magazine paid the seven \"Mercury\" astronauts for their stories in the 1960s. Such payments were not necessarily in cash, as when Hearst newspapers paid the legal bills for the man who kidnapped Charles Lindbergh's son in 1935 in order to get his exclusive story. More recently, \"ABC\" gave Michael Jackson a series of free ads promoting his new album on the same week they interviewed him; those ads in 1995 on \"Prime Time Live\", were valued at $1 million.\n\nAlthough much of the mainstream media opposes any form of payment to news sources, they often will try to compensate their sources indirectly with non-cash benefits, which allows them to claim they did not pay for a story. Such indirect methods may include referring to sources as \"consultants,\" covering source's travel costs, arranging accommodations and covering meal costs, paying for local transportation, arranging their entertainment; and doing so for the source, their family and even friends.\n\nAccording to David Shribman of the Boston Globe, until recently, reporters treated allegations against individuals, including political officials, in much same way: They sought to verify the allegations before putting them into print. Generally, they were made public only after they had been made part of a court record, usually a lawsuit or criminal complaint. In recent years, however, unsubstantiated or unofficial allegations made to a reporter can gain \"almost immediate coverage,\" says Everette Dennis, formerly executive director of the Media Studies Center at Columbia University. And \"once it appears someplace the traditional media feel perfectly free to pick it up. That’s a lower standard than we used to have,\" he said.\n\nMike Bass, executive vice president at \"CNN\", also noted a future of lowering standards when he wrote that the \"whole notion of checkbook journalism stinks. You start paying a few people for their stories, and everybody will insist on compensation. Where will it stop?\" In Britain, the weekly magazine \"OK!\" not only pays celebrities for interviews, it lets them review and approve all photos and articles before being printed. And in the U.S., news magazines are known to offer similar deals with celebrities in order to get exclusive interviews. Newspaper editor David B. Cooper has acknowledged the dangers of paying for stories:\n\nThe frantic, competitive ratings race in television has spawned a wave of awful stuff passing for journalism. Fairness and substance have been eroded by the tabloid style of what I would call celebrity journalism, in which anything goes so long as it might titillate viewers. If the sources of news are going to be paid by those who report the news, the sources will soon learn to say anything to make a more sensational story.\n\nTV networks in the past have paid for interviews with such prominent figures as Sirhan Sirhan, William Calley, G. Gordon Liddy and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. In general, the networks are united in principle that paying for news stories is a dangerous practice and one that could lead to a competition based on how much a news organization could afford to pay for news.\n\nNonetheless, most American journalists oppose paying sources for stories. In one poll only 17 percent of journalism students said they would ever consider paying for an interview. The general public likewise opposes the practice when they are aware of it, as less than a third considered it ethically acceptable. Many news organizations, such as the \"Los Angeles Times\" and \"The New York Times\" forbid the practice as part of their official code of ethics.\n\nTom Bigler, vice president of WBRE-TV offered his opinion: \"I assure you, checkbook journalism is absolutely something we will never take part in. In fact, our station wouldn't give a nickel for a story. Checkbook journalism is fundamentally wrong. It’s simply not proper to ethical journalism. We would never, never, never stoop that low. I know of networks that have done it time to time and they always come to regret it.\" News directors of other Pennsylvania TV stations echoed the same sentiments.\n\nThe practice of paying news sources has been ongoing in Europe and Britain since about the 1850s. According to journalist Neville Thurlbeck, the British press has been practicing checkbook journalism for over 160 years. Related to this was a British \"phone hacking scandal\" in 2002, when it was learned that for years there had been illegal phone hacking, police bribery, and the exercising of improper influence in the pursuit of news stories. The hacking focused on celebrities, politicians, and members of the British Royal Family.\n\nMany criminal trials were being tainted when such payments were made or even promised. In one case in the UK a tabloid promised a young girl $25,000 if the man accused of sexually molesting her was convicted; her testimony was the key evidence. \n\nAnd checkbook journalism has also prevented the public from reading news about major world events. One such event was the birth of the world's first test-tube baby in 1978, which took place in a London hospital. A frantic bidding war took place among newspapers for the exclusive right to interview the parents, doctors and the hospital staff. The competition was won by the \"London Daily Mail,\" after they agreed to pay the parents $600,000. A similar bidding war took place in London in 1996, with the birth and subsequent death of octuplets. The mother received up to an estimated $1.55 million for giving the tabloid, \"News of the World\", exclusive rights to interviews.\n\nThe difference is attitude in Europe toward checkbook journalism was made apparent in 1999, when \"ABC\" did not pay Monica Lewinsky for an interview with Barbara Walters. That was in accord with its policy of not paying sources. However, for an interview Lewinsky gave to a British TV company at about the same time, she was paid $660,000 and promised additional amounts from foreign sales. \"The Brits apparently don't fret over journalistic purity like the colonists do,\" said TV writer Tom Jicha.\n\nAccording to journalism scholar Ron Smith, about two-thirds of British journalists accept the practice of paying news sources. And throughout Europe, government officials require \"honorariums\" before they will grant interviews. In the realm of European sports, tennis and soccer stars typically receive large payments for discussing their game with reporters. While those who have had affairs with sports stars receive large payoffs to be interviewed, as when \"Sky News\" paid $200,000 to a woman who made that claim regarding soccer player David Beckham. In Eastern Europe and Russia, it's been common practice for government officials to be paid before discussing newsworthy events. When, for example, the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, officials were demanding cash up front for access to news sources and sites.\n\nCritics of checkbook journalism say the danger is prevalent among the famous by turning celebrities and politicians into lucrative targets, a complaint leveled by attorneys representing Bob Barker, who was fighting sexual harassment accusations. Ken Perkins of the \"Calgary Herald\" describes such targeting of politicians and celebrities with sexual allegation stories as the \"new voyeurism.\" While President Trump stated that someone asserting \"a mere allegation\" of such behavior could destroy the lives of those accused, since due process is ignored. \n\nIn some situations, when payments to witnesses or story sources became known, it has undermined actual court cases. For example, when in 1991 a woman alleged that William Kennedy Smith had sexually assaulted her, the story made national news primarily because Smith was the nephew of Senator Edward Kennedy. According to one account, during the trial the \"spectators gasped\" when a friend of the alleged victim testified that television show \"A Current Affair\" had paid her $40,000 for two interviews, that a British tabloid, \"Globe\", offered her $100,000, and that the \"National Enquirer\" offered her $450,000 plus 50% royalties for exclusive rights to her story. Another woman who became a witness, and was also paid by \"A Current Affair\" to be interviewed, admitted later that she really knew almost nothing about the alleged assault as she had only met the claimed victim that evening.\n\nInformation brokers, celebrity attorneys, and third-party news agencies, have become sub-industries for assembling news stories for distribution to the media. Most will accept and try to sell your story to numerous publications and keep a percentage of what they receive as their fee. However, unlike news organizations, they will seldom question the facts you submit and will not independently verify their accuracy or truthfulness.\n\nRegardless of the effect on journalistic standards, payments for stories have reached the highest levels of politics. The \"New York Times\" notes that newsmakers who have received large payments include not just witnesses in court cases like the Casey Anthony and O. J. Simpson trials, but former presidents. It adds: \"Evolving standards or no, checkbook journalism has been a persistent and problematic feature of news coverage at even the most powerful and reputable news organizations, long predating the hyper-competitive 24-hour cable news cycle and the celebrity gossip boom. And the issue is not likely to disappear anytime soon ...\" \n\nCal Thomas, a syndicated columnist, explained that the British press, under both Labour and Tory governments, have been paying for news stories for years. He wrote that \"Fleet Street was built on cash for gossip. [While] American media are slightly more sophisticated in pursuing 'exclusive' stories.\"\n\nThe Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) Ethics Committee condemned the actions of \"ABC, NBC and CNN\" in their use of checkbook journalism, when they were bidding for an interview with Tonya Harding, after a figure skating controversy. Harding was paid about $600,000 for her interview in 1994 with tabloid TV show, \"Inside Edition.\" In reaction, one editor wrote that \"the networks are putting 'For Sale' signs on their ethics, their integrity and their objectivity.\" \n\nThe SPJ committee said news organizations that pay for sources, for whatever reason, develop an \"ownership\" interest in these stories. As a result, the public can legitimately question a news organization’s credibility and doubt whether its reports are fair and accurate. At the very least, claims the SPJ, news organizations should state up front what they’ve paid for access and what agreements they’ve made with a news source. \"It's legitimate to question whether sources are telling the truth or embellishing the story a little to earn their paycheck. . . The fact is, that checkbook journalism isn’t really journalism at all.\"\n\n\"Tabloid shows disturb me. Paying for news stories disturbs me,\" said Bob Edwards, former host of National Public Radio’s \"Morning Edition.\" \"It disturbs me that once you pay a person, you have an investment in them, and you may not treat them the same. You may not have the same scrutiny for truth that you may have had before.\" Similarly, former \"NBC News\" president Larry Grossman discredited the practice, calling it a \"sad reflection of the tabloidization of even network news.\" Years later, Grossman had also commented when it was disclosed, during a murder trial, that \"ABC\" had given $200,000 to the suspect. He felt that such a hidden payment could undermine the network's trustworthiness, integrity, honesty of reporting.\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of Journalism\" states that the problem with paying sources for news stories is that the sources will have a natural temptation to embellish or exaggerate their description of events. Since they are being paid, sources may feel obligated to keep the story interesting. When the public learns that the sources of news were paid, however, they often consider the information as being tainted, a mere commodity which was purchased, and thereby less credible. That change of opinion can easily affect the credibility of the news organization or the entire profession.\n\nWhat started as a legitimate news story in 1993, the sexual molestation allegations against singer Michael Jackson, quickly turned into a media circus after a number of tabloid television shows began buying story rights. \"If you want to turn a carnival side show into a main event,\" said Thomas Lennon, producer of \"Frontline\", \"you take a big name and drag it through the mud. . . The story was bought and changed as people cut deals for information. The tabloids set the pace, and the mainstream media followed. . . Competition drives people toward tabloid journalism,” he said. \"It drives production standards up and editorial standards down.\"\n\nJackson's attorneys said that such \"cash-register journalism\" had \"transformed the culture of reporting into a profit-driven enterprise that leaves traditional news organizations in the dust, and likewise turns celebrities into lucrative targets.\" According to \"Washington Post\" writer Howard Kurtz, \"this thriving tabloid culture has erased the old definitions of news by including tawdry and sensational stories about celebrities, for the sake of profit.\" He notes that immediately after sexual allegations against Jackson were publicized, although no proof was given, it drew heavy coverage from numerous major newspapers, and made the cover of countless magazines.\n\n\"That coverage,\" said Kurtz, brought forth a number of \"Jackson aides and hangers-on with palms outstretched.\" They included his former maid, who sold her story to \"Hard Copy.\" Then two of Jackson's bodyguards were paid $100,000 for interviews with \"Hard Copy.\" Jackson tried to undermine their credibility by pointing out they were \"paid witness.\" Other members of the press, especially in London, tried to pay Jackson's domestics, lawyers and so-called psychology experts, to get exclusive inside personal details. \"Their actions start out as hard nosed journalism and disintegrate into frantic payoffs,\" said David Fanning, the British executive producer of \"Frontline\". He noted that \"the irony here is that the tabloids covered a legitimate news story, but the evidence has been adulterated by money changing hands.\"\n\nDuring Bill Clinton's 1992 Presidential election campaign, Jennifer Flowers, a nightclub singer and former state government worker in Arkansas, was paid an estimated $100,000 for her story in a weekly tabloid, where she claimed to having a 12-year long affair with him, which he denied. She continued to sell her affair story to other print media and television tabloids, earning an estimated $500,000 by 1998. Soon after, other reporters were being contacted by women who said they were \"willing to invent stories\" of having had an affair with Clinton if they were paid enough.\n\nIn the opinion of columnist David S. Broder, \"the press has no obligation to go rummaging in the closets of White House contenders for any past indiscretions that may fall out. It is terribly difficult to resolve the issues of motivation, evidence and conflicting recollection that attend such past relationships – and politicians are easily victimized by people seeking to settle old scores.\" Broder said that after 20 years in politics, details about Clinton's private life and old girlfriends should be less relevant as a news story than the public understanding his political accomplishments.\n\nPolitical journalist John Seigenthaler said he observed that the press was moving more and more into accepting unchecked and unsubstantiated hearsay about sexual allegations against public figures. Molly Ivins, a syndicated columnist, said that \"anyone with a pecuniary or political motive for destroying someone else’s reputation was suspect, especially \"charges made by sources with an ax to grind.\"\n\n\"Star\" tabloid published a story about Dick Morris, who was Bill Clinton's campaign manager, that he had been involved with a prostitute. The story seriously affected the final session of the Democratic National Convention in 1996. It led to his discontinuing work on that campaign just two months before the election. \n\nMorris resigned after the story was subsequently also published by the New York Post. He called the published allegations \"sadistic vitriol\" and \"yellow journalism.\" Some Democrats accused the \"Post\" of engaging in a political ploy, which the paper denied. In any case, the story \"exploded in a town full of reporters who haven’t had anything to write for three weeks,\" said \"CNN\" reporter Bruce Morton, \"so we pounced on it.\" \n\nSpeculations soon followed that the the timing of the release of that story was \"no accident,\" but was carefully planned by the \"Star\" to have \"maximum effect.\" The \"Star\"'s editor, Phil Bunton, acknowledged that they paid the prostitute for her information and cooperation. He later said that \"if it was just ‘Dick Morris slept with a hooker,' I don’t think it would have gone anywhere. It would have been a non-story.\" It was apparent that the tabloid wanted the story out before the convention ended. \"ABC\"-TV’s Brit Hume called the story a \"body blow to the president.\" In 1992, the \"Star\" also broke the story about Clinton's alleged affair with nightclub singer Gennifer Flowers, and had reportedly paid her $150,000 for that story.\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore was cleared of allegations that he groped and assaulted a masseuse in 2006. Among the reasons the court denied the allegations were true were that she and her attorney had refused to answer questions about whether she was paid for making the allegation. And because it was commonly known that the \"National Enquirer\", which first published her allegation, had a practice of paying for such stories, the district attorney assumed that she had been compensated. She also failed a polygraph examination about her allegations.\n\n\"Daily Mirror\" editor Piers Morgan described his bidding war for an account by Princess Diana’s butler, Paul Burrell, about his work for her. Burrell was offered up to $1.6 million by various tabloids, and accepted $500,000 from the \"Mirror\". Its circulation jumped 300,000 copies a day during its series of articles. Ironically, Burrell was subsequently attacked by those same losing tabloids for cashing in by revealing Diana’s most intimate secrets.\n\nPublishers and editors of British newspapers subsequently pledged to abide by a new code, as a result of Princess Diana’s death, which lays down rules about privacy, harassment and buying stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Editor Jack Cole, who would create the classic Plastic Man a year later, revamped the character in the next issue and pitted him against \"Silver Streak\"'s lead character, the villainous Claw, for a five-issue battle that made Daredevil a star. The final installment was written by Don Rico, who would write the character through \"Silver Streak\" #17 (Dec. 1941).\n\nBy this time, publisher Lev Gleason had already launched Daredevil's own comic with \"Daredevil Battles Hitler\" #1 (July 1941), in which Daredevil and other \"Silver Streak\" heroes fought the German chancellor. As with \"Captain America Comics\" #1 (March 1941), in which Hitler also gets an ignominious sock in the jaw, the comic anticipated U.S. involvement in World War II. It was written and partially drawn by Charles Biro, who continued on the book when its title changed to \"Daredevil Comics\" with issue #2, and who in his 16-year run would make the character one of the most acclaimed of the Golden Age. Biro rewrote Daredevil's origin in issue #18 (August 1943), now depicting Daredevil's real identity, Bart Hill, as having been raised by aborigines in the Australian Outback.\n\nBiro introduced popular supporting characters the Little Wise Guys in \"Daredevil\" #13 (Oct. 1942). A \"kid gang\" similar to DC Comics' Newsboy Legion and many others, the group consisted of Curly, Jocko, Peewee, Scarecrow, and Meatball – the last of whom, with remarkable daring, was killed two issues later. By the late 1940's, with superheroes going out of fashion, the Little Wise Guys took center stage, edging out Daredevil altogether with issue #70 (Jan. 1950). The series lasted through #134 (Sept. 1956).\n\nDaredevil is now in the public domain, and as a result many publishers have used him to varying degrees.\n\nIn the late 1980's, AC Comics revived Daredevil as part of that publisher's superhero universe. Renamed Reddevil, he appeared as a guest character in \"Femforce\" #45 and #50 before starring in the one-shot title \"Reddevil\" #1 (1991).\n\nDaredevil was one of the many Golden Age heroes who showed up in Roy Thomas' \"Alter Ego\" mini-series. He is renamed as Doubledare.\n\nDaredevil is one of several public domain Golden Age characters set to appear in \"Image Comics\"' \"Next Issue Project\", spearheaded by Image's publisher Erik Larsen.\n\nDaredevil also appeared in issue #141 of Larsen's \"Savage Dragon\" comic series. That issue served to resurrect a slew of public domain Golden Age characters. \"Savage Dragon\" #148 debuted Daredevil as a regular supporting cast member in the series. That issue also brought back the Little Wise Guys. Daredevil becomes deeply involved in the problems of Dragon's ravaged Chicago; he becomes severely injured battling a murderous version of Dragon.\n\nA variation on Daredevil appeared in the comic-book series \"Project Superpowers\", by writer Jim Krueger and artist Alex Ross. In this series, he is billed and trademarked as The Death-Defying 'Devil. In 2008, Dynamite Entertainment spun off a solo miniseries for the character, written by Joe Casey with art by Edgar Salazar. In this series, someone from 'Devil's past – wearing a green version of 'Devil's costume and calling himself \"Dragon\" – believes that the returned hero is an impostor, and is determined to expose him. The Dragon turns out to be Curly, who reveals that the actual 'Devil died in 1987. Within the main series itself, the 'Devil is eventually revealed to be Bart Hill's costume, which had in fact always been sentient and was placed in the urn along with a single boomerang as part of a pact between Hill and the Fighting Yank. The costume does not explicitly reveal its nature to its allies, but eventually discards its pretense of being human by handing the Black Terror the dentures it had been using to create the illusion of a mouth. It possesses additional powers, such as the ability to grow new spike-like branches and the knowledge of an ancient language needed to banish the Claw, and is implied to have its own, sinister agenda.\n\nDaredevil also appears in \"Legends of the Golden Age\" (), an anthology featuring prose tales of Daredevil and the Black Terror. Barry Reese contributed one of the stories in this anthology, which was released in January 2009 by Wild Cat Books.\n\nAs a child, Bart Hill had been rendered mute by the shock of seeing his father murdered and himself being branded with a hot iron. Orphaned, he grew up to become a boomerang marksman, in homage to the boomerang-shaped scar left on his chest. Like Batman, introduced a year earlier, he took up a costume to wage vigilante vengeance.\n\nUpon his partial revamping in the issue following his debut, only Hill's identity, spiked belt, and the boomerang remained; the mute angle was dropped without explanation, and his original symmetrically-divided bodysuit of pale yellow and dark blue was redesigned to a dark red and blue.\n\nIn homage to the Golden Age Daredevil, Marvel Comics' Daredevil would wear a similar costume in the alternate-reality \"Mutant X\" series in \"Mutant X Annual 2001\". In addition, the 2000 \"Marvels Comics: Daredevil\" special had a group based on the Little Wise Guys. A similar, earlier homage came in DC Comics' \"Kingdom Come\" series, when Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt – a character whose regular costume was inspired by Daredevil's, according to creator Pete Morisi – wore a new costume very similar to that of the Golden Age Daredevil.\n\n"}
{"id": "48692563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48692563", "title": "Elverskud", "text": "Elverskud\n\nElverskud is a ballad for soloist, choir and orchestra by Niels W. Gade from 1854.\n\nGade's oeuvre contains many concert pieces of various lengths for orchestra, choir and soloists. Depending on which one counts, there are up to 16 of them, mostly referred to as \"cantata\". The longest of the pieces can take up to an hour. Some of the pieces are almost semi-operas or concert operas with dramatic development.\n\nThe plot of the song comes from the Danish folk-ballad \"Elveskud\".\n\nIn 1842 Gade wrote \"Agnete og Havfruerne\" for solo, female choir and orchestra with text by Hans Christian Andersen, and the same Andersen had in 1846 premiered the opera \"Liden Kirsten\" with music by Gade's father-in-law J. P. E. Hartmann. Both were inspired by Danish folksongs. This may have encouraged Gade to try his hand at the same set of motifs with a major concert piece.\n\nThe earliest information on \"Elverskud\" is a mention in a letter from Gade in 1849, in which he wrote that he had allowed Hans Christian Andersen to prepare a text. For whatever reason it was never used by Gade, but a draft can be found among Andersen's papers. Some parts of the text were transferred to the final version. The next person who turned his hand to this text was Christian Molbech in whose papers there is a version that is closer to the final one, which by all accounts was developed by Gade's cousin Carl Andersen and the editor Gottlieb Siesby, while the atmospheric choral interlude \"I østen stiger solen op\" was written already in 1837 by B. S. Ingemann and received a tune by C. E. F. Weyse the same year.\n\nThe first sheet of Gade's score is dated December 12, 1851, but in March 1853 the work is mentioned a letter to Gade from his wife, suggesting that he had no time to work on it. In early 1854 the work was published in a piano arrangement by a German publisher as \"Ballade nach dänischen Volkssagen\". On 30 March 1854, it was first performed at a subscription concert at the Musikforeningen, presented as a ballad for soloist, choir and orchestra.\n\nThe ballad is divided into five sections, a prologue, three \"acts\" and an epilogue.\n\nGade was apparently keen to emphasize that the music was not adaptations of folk songs, but rather all his own, but inspired by the ballads. Heard today, \"Elverskud\" fits the Danish romance style, particularly in the section where Oluf, the mother and the choir \"talk\" to each other in opera style.\n\n\"Elverskud\" has been shown to be one of the most popular Gade's works. According to a statement in Inger Sørensen's book, it was performed at least 184 times in Gade's life, a success unparalleled by other Danish composers. The work remains popular today, and two of the songs, \"I østen stiger solen op\" and \"Så tit jeg rider mig under ø\" are often played as single pieces.\n\n"}

{"id": "34610414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34610414", "title": "Here Comes the Moon", "text": "Here Comes the Moon\n\n\"Here Comes the Moon\" is a song by English musician George Harrison from his 1979 album \"George Harrison\". Harrison wrote the song while on holiday on the Hawaiian island of Maui in February 1978. His inspiration for the composition was the appearance of the moon in the evening sky, just as the sun was setting. Although the lyrics focus on this natural occurrence rather than on the symbolism it suggests, in the manner of Harrison's Beatles track \"Here Comes the Sun\", the song is seen as a sequel to that similarly titled piece.\n\nHarrison recorded \"Here Comes the Moon\" at his home studio, FPSHOT, in Oxfordshire. Reflecting the circumstances of the song's creation, the recording features a lush musical arrangement that includes acoustic and slide guitars, layered harmony vocals, orchestral strings, and sitar drone. An edited version of the track appeared on his 1989 compilation \"Best of Dark Horse\". Harrison's solo demo of the song was included as a bonus track on the 2004 reissue of \"George Harrison\".\n\nGeorge Harrison wrote \"Here Comes the Moon\" while in Hana on the Hawaiian island of Maui in February 1978. The purpose of the visit was partly to write material for his first album in two years, titled simply \"George Harrison\", and partly for Harrison and his girlfriend, Olivia Arias, to enjoy a holiday after learning that they were to become parents for the first time. As with several of the songs on the album, Harrison drew inspiration for \"Here Comes the Moon\" from his surroundings on Maui. In his 1980 autobiography, \"I Me Mine\", he recalls seeing \"marvellous\" sunsets there and regularly sighting whales. On this particular occasion, Harrison adds, \"the full moon was coming up as the sun was going down – all this \"and\" here comes the moon! Too much.\" His experience was heightened by the effects of either LSD or magic mushrooms, the last of which provided inspiration for another new song, \"Soft-Hearted Hana\".\n\nHarrison's handwritten lyrics for \"Here Comes the Moon\" are dated 25 February, the day after his 35th birthday. The song's nature-related theme matches that of much of his previous work, including \"All Things Must Pass\", \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Blow Away\". Due to the similarity of its title with \"Here Comes the Sun\", the song has invited interpretation as a sequel to that 1969 Harrison composition. Author Ian Inglis writes that the two songs differ significantly, however, in that while \"Here Comes the Sun\" adopts the arrival of sunshine as a metaphor for hope and an end to a dark emotional mood, \"Here Comes the Moon\" focuses purely on the moment itself, rather than what the moon's appearance might suggest. While also viewing the songs as having little in common aside from their titles, Harrison biographer Simon Leng considers that \"Here Comes the Moon\" shares the earlier composition's theme of escape. According to singer Stevie Nicks, she spent time with Harrison in Hana during this period and helped him write the lyrics for the song.\nAs with all the songs on \"George Harrison\", music journalist John Metzger considers \"Here Comes the Moon\" to be in the folk pop style. The composition includes a series of descending guitar arpeggios before the start of each verse. The time signature is 6/8 over these guitar passages and the similarly descending choruses, and 4/4 over the verses and the middle eight.\n\nIn his lyrics, Harrison conveys a state of wonder at the natural world. He celebrates the arrival of the moon and rues that many people ignore its presence. He describes it as both \"a little brother to the sun\" and \"mother to the stars at night\", and comments on the heightened impulse it stimulates throughout the natural world during the full moon phase. In the middle eight, he terms the moon's arrival \"God's gift\", in that it mirrors light to the world. According to Leng, the song presents a \"mystical never-never land of natural purity\" that recalls the message and imagery first conveyed by Harrison in his 1970 composition \"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp\".\n\nHarrison recorded \"Here Comes the Moon\" during sessions held between March and October 1978 at his FPSHOT studio in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. He produced the album with Russ Titelman, a Warner Bros. staff producer whose previous projects included Ry Cooder's \"Chicken Skin Music\", a 1976 album that reflected Cooder's adoption of Hawaiian musical influences. Aside from Harrison, the musicians on the track were keyboard players Neil Larsen and Steve Winwood, percussionist Ray Cooper and the rhythm section of Willie Weeks (bass) and Andy Newmark (drums). Typical of the mellow sound on \"George Harrison\", Harrison played acoustic guitar on the track and overdubbed lead parts on slide guitar. Orchestral strings for this and other songs on the album were arranged by Del Newman and recorded at AIR Studios in London.\n\nIn the opinion of authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, the completed track's ethereal quality reflects its composer's \"altered sensibilities\" and the circumstances that inspired the song. Leng notes signs of Harrison's \"Beatles heritage\", citing as one example the multi-layered backing vocals that Harrison and Winwood perform, which he says \"invok[e] the majesty of 'Because'\". Author Alan Clayson also comments on the song's 1960s references, including the vocalised \"oh yeah\"s and the subtle use of sitar drone.\n\nHarrison discussed \"Here Comes the Moon\" when he appeared as a guest, along with Michael Jackson, on the BBC Radio 1 show \"Roundtable\" on 9 February 1979. Harrison said it was a track he enjoyed and that while completing the mixing of the album he would get so relaxed when listening to it that he almost fell asleep each time.\n\n\"George Harrison\" was released on the artist's Dark Horse record label on 20 February 1979. \"Here Comes the Moon\" appeared as the third track on the album, sequenced between \"Not Guilty\" and \"Soft-Hearted Hana\". That same year, Harrison furthered his ties to Hawaii when he bought Kuppu Qulua, a property in Nahiku, near Hana.\n\"Here Comes the Moon\" was included on the 1989 compilation album \"Best of Dark Horse\", the content of which partly reflected Harrison's personal preferences by omitting some of his hit singles in favour of album tracks. This release contained an edited version of the song, with the track length reduced to 4:07.\n\nWhen Harrison's Dark Horse albums were remastered for his posthumous \"Dark Horse Years\" reissue campaign in 2004, an acoustic demo of \"Here Comes the Moon\" appeared as the sole bonus track on the \"George Harrison\" CD.<ref name=\"Metzger/MB\">John Metzger, \"George Harrison \"The Dark Horse Years\" (Part Two: \"George Harrison\")\", \"The Music Box\", vol. 11 (5), May 2004 (retrieved 5 November 2016).</ref> This selection was again at Harrison's request, since he had chosen the bonus tracks for the reissues before his death in November 2001. The expanded CD booklet included a photo of Harrison writing the song on acoustic guitar. In his liner-note essay in the \"Dark Horse Years\" box set, music critic David Fricke cited \"Here Comes the Moon\" as his personal best rediscovery among Harrison's long-unavailable Dark Horse catalogue, describing it as a \"gorgeous sequel\" to \"Here Comes the Sun\" \"with milky-waterfall harmonies in the chorus line\".\n\nAmong contemporary reviews of \"George Harrison\", \"Billboard\" described \"Here Comes the Moon\" as a song \"inspired by the sublime atmosphere\" of Hawaii and ranked it as the second of the album's \"best cuts\", after \"Love Comes to Everyone\". In \"Rolling Stone\", Stephen Holden admired Harrison and Titelman for creating the artist's leanest and most buoyant musical arrangements yet. While recognising the album's avoidance of contemporary pop styles, he grouped the song with \"Not Guilty\" and \"Soft-Hearted Hana\" as tracks that \"transport us back into psychedelic lotus land, but their tone is so airy and whimsical that the nostalgia is as seductive as it is anachronistic\". Writing in \"Melody Maker\", E.J. Thribb said it was an album that \"grows in its effect after a few plays\" and concluded that with this and other songs, Harrison had \"brought both sunshine and moonshine into our lives\".<ref name=\"Thribb/MM\"></ref>\n\nGreg Kot's assessment for \"Rolling Stone\" in 2002 read in part: \"'Here Comes the Moon' is a dreamy little wonder, the kind of incantation that underscores the [album's] romantic subtlety …\" Among reviews of the 2004 reissue, PopMatters' Jason Korenkiewicz recognised \"Here Comes the Moon\" as one of the standout tracks, describing it as a \"dreamy psychedelic sing-a-long\" on an album that reflected Harrison's \"new found sense of calm and peace\", while Parke Puterbaugh of \"Rolling Stone\" said it was one of the \"memorably lilting tunes\" that made \"George Harrison\" the artist's \"midcareer peak\". Conversely, Richard Ginell of AllMusic deems \"George Harrison\" to be \"an ordinary album from an extraordinary talent\", and he dismisses the track as \"a lazy retake\" on \"Here Comes the Sun\".<ref name=\"Ginell/AM\">Richard S. Ginell, \"George Harrison \"George Harrison\"\", AllMusic (retrieved 5 November 2016).</ref>\n\nFormer \"Mojo\" editor Mat Snow includes \"Here Comes the Moon\" among the album's best tracks, which he describes as \"romantic and reflective\" and, thanks largely to Titelman's involvement, \"tastefully contemporary\". Writing on his website Elsewhere, \"New Zealand Herald\" critic Graham Reid considers the song to be a \"lovely\" track, yet also, in its drawing on a similar theme to \"Here Comes the Sun\", a sign that Harrison's inspiration was waning.<ref name=\"Reid/Elsewhere\">Graham Reid, \"George Harrison Revisited, Part Two (2014): The dark horse at a canter to the end\" > \"George Harrison\", Elsewhere, 24 October 2014 [22 November 2011] (retrieved 5 November 2016).</ref> Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez states that, as with \"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\" (Harrison's titular sequel to \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"), such comparisons are unfounded and reflective of music critics' overly reverential approach to the Beatles' work. Rodriguez adds: \"Even had the earlier song never been written, 'Moon' would still stand as a lovely, lyrical evocation of the lunar orb and the emotion it stirs.\"\n\nAccording to Simon Leng:\n\n\n"}

Savage is a 40-page, magazine-format comics novel released in 1968 as a precursor to the modern graphic novel. Created by the veteran American comic book artist Gil Kane, who conceived, plotted and illustrated the project, and writer Archie Goodwin, who scripted under the pseudonym Robert Franklin, the black-and-white magazine was published by Kane's Adventure House Press, and distributed to newsstands.\n\n\"His Name Is... Savage\" #1 (June 1968), the sole issue published, was the first full-length comics story in a non-comic book format since 1950, when St. John Publications issued the digest-sized hardboiled detective novellas \"It Rhymes with Lust\" and \"The Case of the Winking Buddha\". Like them, \"Savage\" was also sold on newsstands rather than in book stores. Marvel Comics, shortly after \"Savage\" appeared, published the first of a two-issue comics magazine, \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\", starring that titular superhero. Like the similar, anthological comics magazines of the time, such as \"Creepy\", \"Eerie\" and \"Vampirella\", both \"His Name Is... Savage\" and \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" cost 35¢, whereas a typical comic book cost 12¢ and double-size issues 25¢.\nGil Kane in the 1960s was a well-established comic-book artist who had co-created the modern versions of the DC Comics superheroes Green Lantern and the Atom. He was additionally an early and outspoken advocate of creators' rights in an industry that at the time did not offer character ownership or royalties. Circa 1963, Kane set up a studio on East 63rd Street in Manhattan, New York City, New York, and for five years worked sporadically on both \"His Name Is... Savage\" and a project that would become the paperback comics novel \"Blackmark\". Kane in 1996 said the actual drawing of \"Savage\" \"was done, from beginning to end, in 30 days. That last page was inked at the printer while they were getting the book ready\".\n\nKane conceived the character Savage, an espionage agent and troubleshooter, and developed the story and art. He based his protagonist visually on actor Lee Marvin, whom Kane had seen in the movie \"Point Blank\". The resemblance was much more pointed on Robert Foster's photo-referenced painted cover, which was replaced by a new Kane illustration for the 1982 Fantagraphics reprint. Kane said in 1996, \"We never had any trouble from Lee Marvin — obviously he never saw the goddamn thing. We never had any trouble from anybody\".\n\nDuring this process, he brought in Archie Goodwin, a writer-editor then at the black-and-white horror-magazine publisher Warren Publishing, to script. Goodwin did so under the pseudonym Robert Franklin; in the 1982 reprint, \"Gil Kane's Savage\", Goodwin, under his own name, is credited alongside Kane for \"Story.\" Larry Koster handled production, with artist Robert Foster contributing a painted cover. Manny Stallman, a comic-book artist and Kane colleague, introduced Kane \"to printers and sales representatives, and it was through Manny that I met the people who ultimately allowed me to turn out \"His Name Is... Savage\",\" Kane said.\n\nKane entered into an arrangement with the large newsstand-distribution company Kable News, who jointly published the magazine with Kane under Kane's imprint, Adventure House Press, Inc.. Kane said in 1996 that Kable paid the printing and manufacturing costs but no art or editorial fees.\n\nThe project encountered production difficulties, with Kane having difficulty finding a printer willing to risk alienating the large mainstream comics publishers.\n\nDifficulties continued at the distribution level. Adventure House Press printed 200,000 copies, but only approximately one-tenth reached newsstands, per Kane's private estimate. Local distributors, who took magazines on consignment from national distributor Kable, chose for unknown reasons not to carry the magazine, and returned their copies for credit. \"We started to get all these boxes of comics back\", Kane said. Though planned as a continuing series, with Kane having completed cover art for issues #2-3, only this initial issue was produced.\n\nThat sole story, \"The Return of the Half-Man\", is a science-fiction spy thriller concerning a cyborg renegade retired general, Simon Mace, who kidnaps the U.S. president and impersonates him at a United Nations assembly in an attempt to ignite a world war. The story and art were more graphically violent than comic books and movies of the day, with one panel showing a pulped and bloody crushed hand and another showing a metal gun-barrel smashing through a man's teeth and sending teeth flying.\n\n\"Savage depends on only two things: guts and his .357 magnum, which he has no compunction about using,\" one critic wrote of the 1982 reissue. \"Broken noses, splintering teeth, and splattering brains are all depicted in lurid detail They are part and parcel of Savage's obdurate attempts to stop a madman from instigating World War III. Although this is an old theme, Kane and Goodwin present a tale that is riveting and upsettingly believable.\"\n\nFantagraphics Books reprinted \"His Name Is... Savage\" in 1982 under the title \"Gil Kane's Savage\", rendered as \"Gil Kane's Savage!\" on its cover logo. It had new cover art by Kane to replace the original painted cover which bore perhaps too much resemblance to Lee Marvin.\n\nOther alterations for the 68-page, black-and-white comics magazine, cover-priced $2.50, also included what one critic described as \"a more esthetic typeface (to supplant the older, which was shabby, uneven, and contained many typos);a foreword by comics journalist R. C. Harvey; and two ... interviews with Kane (one dealing specifically with \"Savage\", the other concerned primarily with technique).\" The latter, conducted by Will Eisner, was reprinted from Kitchen Sink Press' \"The Spirit\" #28 (April 1981), originally published as \"Shop Talk: Gil Kane\".\n\nThe character returned in a four-page vignette titled \"Gil Kane's Savage\" in the benefit publication \"Anything Goes\" #1 (1986, Fantagraphics Books). Kane also drew the cover, featuring Savage.\n\n\n"}

Jugglers often refer to the objects they juggle as props. The most common props are balls, clubs, or rings. Some jugglers use more dramatic objects such as knives, fire torches or chainsaws. The term \"juggling\" can also commonly refer to other prop-based manipulation skills, such as diabolo, devil sticks, poi, cigar boxes, contact juggling, hooping, yo-yo, and hat manipulation.\n\nThe words \"juggling\" and \"juggler\" derive from the Middle English \"jogelen\" (\"to entertain by performing tricks\"), which in turn is from the Old French \"jangler\". There is also the Late Latin form \"joculare\" of Latin \"joculari\", meaning \"to jest\". Although the etymology of the terms \"juggler\" and \"juggling\" in the sense of manipulating objects for entertainment originates as far back as the 11th century, the current sense of \"to juggle\", meaning \"to continually toss objects in the air and catch them\", originates from the late 19th century.\n\nFrom the 12th to the 17th century, \"juggling\" and \"juggler\" were the terms most consistently used to describe acts of magic, though some have called the term \"juggling\" a lexicographical nightmare, stating that it is one of the least understood relating to magic. In the 21st century, the term \"juggling\" usually refers to toss juggling, where objects are continuously thrown into the air and caught again, repeating in a rhythmical pattern.\n\nAccording to James Ernest in his book \"Contact Juggling\", most people will describe juggling as \"throwing and catching things\"; however, a juggler might describe the act as \"a visually complex or physically challenging feat using one or more objects\". David Levinson and Karen Christensen describe juggling as \"the sport of tossing and catching or manipulating objects [...] keeping them in constant motion\". \"Juggling, like music, combines abstract patterns and mind-body coordination in a pleasing way.\"\n\nThe earliest record of juggling is suggested in a panel from the 15th (1994 to 1781 B.C.) Beni Hasan tomb of an unknown Egyptian prince, showing female dancers and acrobats throwing balls. Juggling has been recorded in many early cultures including Egyptian, Nabataean, Chinese, Indian, Greek, Roman, Norse, Aztec (Mexico) and Polynesian civilizations.\n\nJuggling in ancient China was an art performed by some warriors. One such warrior was Xiong Yiliao, whose juggling of nine balls in front of troops on a battlefield reportedly caused the opposing troops to flee without fighting, resulting in a complete victory.\n\nIn Europe, juggling was an acceptable diversion until the decline of the Roman Empire, after which the activity fell into disgrace. Throughout the Middle Ages, most histories were written by religious clerics who frowned upon the type of performers who juggled, called gleemen, accusing them of base morals or even practicing witchcraft. Jugglers in this era would only perform in marketplaces, streets, fairs, or drinking houses. They would perform short, humorous and bawdy acts and pass a hat or bag among the audience for tips. Some kings' and noblemen’s bards, fools, or jesters would have been able to juggle or perform acrobatics, though their main skills would have been oral (poetry, music, comedy and storytelling).\n\nIn 1768, Philip Astley opened the first modern circus. A few years later, he employed jugglers to perform acts along with the horse and clown acts. Since then, jugglers have been associated with circuses.\n\nIn the early 19th century, troupes from Asia, such as the famous \"Indian Jugglers\" referred to by William Hazlitt, arrived to tour Britain, Europe and parts of America.\n\nIn the 19th century, variety and music hall theatres became more popular, and jugglers were in demand to fill time between music acts, performing in front of the curtain while sets were changed. Performers started specializing in juggling, separating it from other kinds of performance such as sword swallowing and magic. The Gentleman Juggler style was established by German jugglers such as Salerno and Kara. Rubber processing developed, and jugglers started using rubber balls. Previously, juggling balls were made from balls of twine, stuffed leather bags, wooden spheres, or various metals. Solid or inflatable rubber balls meant that bounce juggling was possible. Inflated rubber balls made ball spinning easier and more readily accessible. Soon in North America, vaudeville theatres employed jugglers, often hiring European performers.\n\nIn the early to mid-20th century, variety and vaudeville shows decreased in popularity due to competition from motion picture theatres, radio and television, and juggling suffered as a result. Music and comedy transferred very easily to radio, but juggling could not. In the early years of TV, when variety-style programming was popular, jugglers were often featured; but developing a new act for each new show, week after week, was more difficult for jugglers than other types of entertainers; comedians and musicians can pay others to write their material, but jugglers cannot get other people to learn new skills on their behalf.\n\nThe International Jugglers' Association, founded in 1947, began as an association for professional vaudeville jugglers, but restrictions for membership were eventually changed, and non-performers were permitted to join and attend the annual conventions. The IJA continues to hold an annual convention each summer and runs a number of other programs dedicated to advance the art of juggling worldwide.\n\nWorld Juggling Day was created as an annual day of recognition for the hobby, with the intent to teach people how to juggle, to promote juggling and to get jugglers together and celebrate. It is held on the Saturday in June closest to the 17th, the founding date of the International Jugglers' Association.\n\nMost cities and large towns now have juggling clubs. These are often based within, or connected to, universities and colleges. There are also community circus groups that teach young people and put on shows. The Juggling Edge maintains a searchable database of most juggling clubs.\n\nSince the 1980s, a juggling culture has developed. The scene revolves around local clubs and organizations, special events, shows, magazines, web sites, internet forums and, possibly most importantly, juggling conventions. In recent years, there has also been a growing focus on juggling competitions. Juggling today has evolved and branched out to the point where it is synonymous with all prop manipulation. The wide variety of the juggling scene can be seen at any juggling convention.\n\nJuggling conventions or festivals form the backbone of the juggling scene. The focus of most of these conventions is the main space used for open juggling. There will also be more formal workshops in which expert jugglers will work with small groups on specific skills and techniques. Most juggling conventions also include a main show (open to the general public), competitions, and juggling games.\n\nJuggling can be categorised by various criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToss juggling and club passing world records are tracked by the Juggling Information Service Committee on Numbers Juggling (JISCON) (now defunct) . The records listed on the JISCON page represent the longest runs with each number and prop that have been authenticated using video evidence.\n\nThe most footballs (soccer balls) juggled simultaneously is five and was achieved by Victor Rubilar (Argentina) at the Gallerian Shopping Centre in Stockholm, Sweden, on 4 November 2006. This was equaled by Marko Vermeer (Netherlands) in Amstelveen, Netherlands, on 11 August 2014 and Isidro Silveira (Spain), in Adeje, Tenerife, Spain, on 4 November 2015.\n\nProfessional jugglers perform in a number of different styles, which are not mutually exclusive. These juggling styles have developed or been introduced over time with some becoming more popular at some times than others.\n\nTraditional circus-style juggling emphasises high levels of skill and sometimes large-scale props to enable the act to \"fill\" the circus ring. The juggling act may involve some comedy or other circus skills such as acrobatics, but the principal focus is the technical skill of the jugglers. Costumes are usually colourful with sequins. Variations within this style include the traditions from Chinese and Russian circus.\n\nComedy juggling acts vary greatly in their skill level, prop use and costuming. However, they all share the fact that the focus of the performance is comedic rather than a demonstration of technical juggling skill. Comedy juggling acts are most commonly seen in street performance, festivals and fairs.\n\nThis style was popular in variety theatres and usually involves juggling some of the elements of a gentleman's attire namely hats, canes, gloves and cigars − and other everyday items such as plates and wine bottles. The style is often sophisticated and visual rather than comedic, though has been interpreted in many different styles. French juggler Gaston Palmer, for example, gained a kind of notoriety for his comedic execution of gentleman juggling tricks.\n\nJugglers perform themed acts, sometimes with specifically themed props and usually in themed costumes. Examples include jesters, pirates, sports, Victorians and chefs.\n\nJugglers commonly feature in circuses, with many performers having enjoyed a star billing. Circus jugglers come from many countries and include those from Russia and other Eastern European countries, China, Latin America and other European countries. Some of the greatest jugglers from the past 50 years are from Eastern Europe, including Sergej Ignatov, Andrii Kolesnikov, Evgenij Biljauer, and Gregory Popovich.\n\nVariety theatres have a long history of including juggling acts on their billing. Vaudeville in the USA and Music halls in the UK regularly featured jugglers during the heyday of variety theatre in the first half of 20th century. Variety theatre has declined in popularity but is still present in many European countries, particularly Germany. Television talent shows have introduced juggling acts to a wider audience with the newest examples being Britain's Got Talent and America's Got Talent.\n\nIn North America jugglers have often performed in casinos, in places like Las Vegas. Germany and the United States have produced some of the greatest jugglers from the past 50 years, most notably Francis Brunn from Germany and Anthony Gatto from the United States.\n\nThere is a wide variety of festivals and fairs where juggling acts are sometimes booked to perform. Music, food and arts festivals have all booked professional performers. The festivals can range from very large scale events such as Glastonbury Festival to small town or village fairs. The acts may differ from year to year or a one-act may become a regular feature at these yearly events.\n\nRenaissance fairs in North America and medieval fairs in Europe often book professional jugglers. Other historically themed events such as Victorian, maritime, and large-scale festivals of history such as the one organised by English Heritage regularly employ juggling acts as part of the event.\n\nIn many countries such as the UK, USA, Australia, Spain, France jugglers perform on the street (busking). Street juggling acts usually perform what is known as a circle show and collect money at the end of the performance in a hat or bottle. Most street jugglers perform comedy juggling acts. Well known locations for this kind of street performance include Covent Garden in London, Faneuil Hall in Boston, Outside the Pump Rooms in Bath, Prince's Street in Edinburgh, outside the Pompidou Centre in Paris, Circular Quay in Sydney, and Pearl Street in Boulder.\n\nJuggling has been performed in space despite the fact that the micro-gravity environment of orbit deprives the juggled objects of the essential ability to fall. This was accomplished initially by Don Williams, as part of a Houston scientist's \"Toys In Space\" project, with apples and oranges.\n\nTwo person juggling passing multiple objects between them was first accomplished in space by Greg Chamitoff and Richard Garriott while Garriott was visiting the International Space Station as a Spaceflight Participant in October 2008. Their juggling of objects while in orbit was featured in \"Apogee of Fear\", the first science fiction movie made in space by Garriott and 'Zero-G Magic', a magic show also recorded in space by Chamitoff and Garriott at that time.\n\nMathematics has been used to understand juggling as juggling has been used to test mathematics. The number of possible patterns \"n\" digits long using \"b\" or fewer balls is \"b\" and the average of the numbers in a siteswap pattern equal the number of balls required for the pattern. For example, the number of three digit three ball patterns is 3 = 27, and the box, (4,2x)(2x,4), requires (4+2+4+2)/4 = 3 balls.\n\n\"The time that a ball spends in flight is proportional to the square root of the height of the throw,\" meaning that the number of balls used greatly increases the amount of speed or height required, which increases the need for accuracy between the direction and synchronization of throws.\n\nCoupled oscillation and synchronization (\"the tendency of two limbs to move at the same frequency\") appear to be easier in all patterns and also required by certain patterns. For example, \"the fountain pattern...can be stably performed in two ways...one can perform the fountain with different frequencies for the two hands, but that coordination is difficult because of the tendency of the limbs to synchronize,\" while \"in the cascade...the crossing of the balls between the hands demands that one hand catches at the same rate that the other hand throws.\"\n\nClaude Shannon, builder of the first juggling robot, developed a juggling theorem, relating the time balls spend in the air and in the hands: \"(F+D)H=(V+D)N\", where \"F\" = time a ball spends in the air, \"D\" = time a ball spends in a hand/time a hand is full, \"V\" = time a hand is vacant, \"N\" = number of balls, and \"H\" = number of hands. For example, a hand's and a ball's perspectives in the two-hand (\"H\") three-ball (\"N\") cascade pattern:\n\nJuggling tricks and patterns can become very complex, and hence can be difficult to communicate to others. Therefore, notation systems have been developed for specifying patterns, as well as for discovering new patterns.\n\nDiagram-based notations are the clearest way to show juggling patterns on paper, but as they are based on images, their use is limited in text-based communication. Ladder diagrams track the path of all the props through time, where the less complicated causal diagrams only track the props that are in the air, and assumes that a juggler has a prop in each hand. Numeric notation systems are more popular and standardized than diagram-based notations. They are used extensively in both a written form and in normal conversations among jugglers.\n\nSiteswap is by far the most common juggling notation. Various heights of throw, considered to take specific \"beats\" of time to complete, are assigned a relative number. From those, a pattern is conveyed as a sequence of numbers, such as \"3\", \"744\", or \"97531\". Those examples are for two hands making alternating or \"asynchronous\" throws, and often called \"vanilla siteswap\". For showing patterns in which both hands throw at the same time, there are other notating conventions for synchronous siteswap. There is also \"multiplex siteswap\" for patterns where one hand holds or throws two or more balls on the same beat. Other extensions to siteswap have been developed, including passing siteswap, Multi-Hand Notation (MHN), and General Siteswap (GS).\n\n\n\nOrganizations\n\nResources\n\nOther\n"}

{"id": "52437784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52437784", "title": "Live from Here", "text": "Live from Here\n\nLive from Here, formerly known as A Prairie Home Companion with Chris Thile, is an American variety radio show known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians, tongue-in-cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor. Hosted by Chris Thile, it airs on Saturday evenings and is usually recorded in front of a live audience at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, although the show frequently goes on tour to New York City and other U.S. cities.\n\nThe show is derived from the historic \"A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor\" (\"APHC\") radio show. The original host, Garrison Keillor, performed his final show in July 2016, and Thile's program began on October 15, 2016. Thile, an American virtuoso mandolinist and singer-songwriter, had a two-decade history with \"APHC\" and is known for his work in the folk and progressive bluegrass groups Nickel Creek and Punch Brothers. After two unprecedented guest host spots in 2015, Keillor decided on his successor, featured Thile as host again in January–February 2016, and fully ceded his hosting role to Thile in the October 2016 performance at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, continuing as the show's Executive Producer. Thile's new program presents expanded musical and comedic elements, retaining the template of the earlier program (e.g., its most recent acting and sound effect cast, and \"sponsorships\" from fictitious companies), but without such features as its earlier signature \"Lives of the Cowboys\" series and \"News from Lake Wobegon\" monologue. Reviews of the new program have been uniformly positive, focusing on the remaining familiar elements and on the new music and expanded musical focus brought by the new host.\n\nOn November 29, 2017, in the wake of allegations of misconduct against Keillor, American Public Media announced it would change the show's name. The new name of the show was announced as Live from Here live on the December 16, 2017, broadcast of the show.\n\nChris Thile, born in 1981, is an American virtuoso mandolinist and singer-songwriter known for his folk and progressive bluegrass work in the trio Nickel Creek and the quintet Punch Brothers. A child prodigy in music—self-described as \"begging [his] parents for a mandolin from the time [he] was 2\" and picking up the mandolin for the first time at the age of 5—Thile was one of a trio, with siblings Sara and Sean Watkins, home-schooled California children in musical families, who formed the group Nickel Creek with Thile's father in 1989. An acoustic group, it continues as a trio to the present day (2016), with Thile's participation alongside his more recent acoustic quintet Punch Brothers, both variously described using terms such as folk, progressive, bluegrass, \"newgrass,\" and roots music. Thile was awarded BBC's Folk Musician of the Year award in 2007, a MacArthur Fellowship \"genius\" award in 2012, and he has been nominated eight time for Grammy Awards, winning four, all Best Album awards, in different categories in 1997, 2002, 2013, and 2015 (Bluegrass, Contemporary Folk, Folk, and Contemporary Instrumental, respectively). Garrison Keillor has made known his personal opinion, that Thile is “the great bluegrass performer of our time.” As well, others have observed that \"[t]hough charming and cheery, Thile is by nature deeply competitive,\" and understands the business side of matters, and that the size of audiences that the show attracts will matter (see below).\n\nThile first performed with Garrison Keillor on \"A Prairie Home Companion\" in 1996, at age 15. Over the next two decades, Thile returned to \"APHC\" eight times (according to the program's website), performing both as a solo artist and as a part of the groups Nickel Creek and the Punch Brothers. These guest appearances included performances at the programs home venue, the Fitzgerald Theater, and at tour venues. Programs in which Thile participated that received press coverage or are otherwise sourced and noteworthy appear below.\n\n\nWhen Keillor announced in November 2014 that he would absent himself from \"APHC\" for \"only the second time in decades,\" he yielded the host's microphone to Thile for these guest host appearances. Thile began these appearances in 2015 and appeared a total of 4 times in the twelve months thereafter, the final two guest host spots being on January 30 and February 6, 2016.\n\nThe guest host appearances gave an indication of the type of crew that Thile would assemble, the kinds of guests he would attract, and the style in which he might host (see Format and Cast, below). The hosted programs were on the following dates, and featured the following guest artists:\n\nIn 2015, Keillor announced that he would step down from hosting the program and designated Chris Thile as the new host. Keillor's final episode of the show was recorded live on July 1, 2016, at the Hollywood Bowl in California for an audience of 18,000 fans and broadcast the next day. Keillor retained artistic rights and trademark to the show's name as well as some distribution rights and rights to retail items connected with \"A Prairie Home Companion\". Thile made his debut as permanent host on October 15, 2016.\n\nIn November 2017 Minnesota Public Radio severed all business ties with former \"APHC\" host Garrison Keillor over unspecified \"inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him.\" The Minnesota Public Radio website listed the show under the working title \"The Show with Chris Thile\", as the trademark for \"A Prairie Home Companion\" is held by Keillor, not MPR. Thile addressed the situation on the December 2 installment of the series, and Thile began using a new theme, \"Radio Boogie\".\n\nThe show aired under the placeholder title of \"The Show with Chris Thile\" for the next two Saturdays. Finally, on December 16, Thile announced the show's new name as \"Live from Here.\"\n\nThile has referred to the program that Keillor created as a \"truly great wor[k] of art\" and so \"immortal,\" so that he would \"keep using the template [Keillor] created to tell each other stories and to escape from our daily cares. Even so, Andrew Leahy of the \"Rolling Stone\" writes that Thile has had added to the mandate of \"preserving the show's appeal\" a further one of \"revising its structure and broadening its reach to younger generations.\" Hence, the program continues to present a variety of program elements, including music, and storytelling, comedic and otherwise (see following), but Thile has indicated some changes in direction, and others are noted in early reviews. Absent from the new program is the \"Lives of the Cowboys\" sketch, and the signature weekly \"News from Lake Wobegon\" monologues from Garrison Keillor; still present as of October 2016 are \"old favorites\" such as the program's faux sponsorship by Powdermilk Biscuits.\n\nAs of the opening month of the program, the planned replacement for the Keillor monologue was a slate of appearances from standup comics, for instance, the Irish comedian Maeve Higgins. New music from the host, and expanded music in general, have been noted as features of the new program. Andrew Leahy of \"Rolling Stone\" offers as perspective, that Thile has indicated that the musical variety of the premiere program (see below) will continue, with listeners to expect \"roots-rockers, folksingers, jazz musicians, soul revivalists and bluegrass bands all taking the stage.\"\n\nIn addition to Chris Thile, who will contribute originally composed music and performances on his various instruments, the musical and acting cast and crew consists of the following artists, as of 1 December 2016 (in credit order from the production page for the shows performers, where deeper autobiographies appear).\n\nThe following regular musicians and roles are reported:\n\nThe following are other regular performers and roles as reported: \nLocal public radio stations carry the weekly production of \"Live from Here with Chris Thile\" at one or more broadcast times, varying by station, and as of March 2018, the NPR Now channel on SiriusXM Satellite Radio carried the program on Saturday at 5 PM and Sundays at 11 AM, both Central Time (UTC – 6). The audio of the program also streams, live online, at \"livefromhere.org\" on Saturdays from 5-7 PM Central, and video streams are likewise available when the program broadcasts from their home venue, The Fitzgerald Theater, or their 'home-away-from-home,\" The Town Hall in New York City. Streaming audio from each show posts following the Saturday broadcast at \"livefromhere.org\", as of March 2018 at 12 PM, Central Time on Sunday.\n\nThe entirety of programs are made available via Live from Here's official website on Sunday at 12 PM Central Time (UTC - 6) following each Saturday broadcast. Highlights from the show, including Chris Thile’s “Song of the Week,” are available via RSS, iHeartRadio, iTunes, Stitcher, and TuneIn.\n\nIn the announcement of the change in host for the program, American Public Media stated: Keillor, who had made various statements regarding retirement in the past, was described in June 2016 as being \"fairly serious this time,\" and he is quoted as saying “Chris is my man, and I’m eager to stay home and read books.” Elaborating further, Keillor wrote to Abe Streep of \"The New York Times Magazine\", indicating that Thile's adventurous nature—alongside his high esteem for “the great bluegrass performer”—were reasons for his consideration as Keillor's replacement, which would be tested via a trial run of guest host appearances in January–February 2016; Keillor wrote, Keillor went on to write about Thile, “He takes big chances… He can be a chameleon, he can swim in every event, and for all his brilliance, nobody sounds better singing old American songs than he. Nobody.”\n\nThile, in discussing the changeover with Minnesota Public Radio, indicated that he would continue to write new musical material, as he has in initial programs since his debut as host: \"I would like to write something new every week... I've written a new song for each show. I want to keep doing that. It's so much fun.\" In addition, he has highlighted comedy as an element for the new show, noting the success of appearances of comedian Maria Bamford in shows he had hosted early in 2016 which gave \"five or six minutes of hilarity.\" With regard to story telling, he noted the success of an appearance by actor Ed Helms, indicating that the new \"APHC\" will \"have that kind of thing going on.\" When asked about future on-air material from show originator and current executive producer Garrison Keillor, Thile replied, \"He's such an amazing writer that if he comes up with an idea that would be good for the show… I imagine we'll get a script here and there.\"\n\nWhile much media focus during the changeover is on the artistry and styles associated with Keillor and Thile, \"APHC\" and American Public Media (APM) are businesses as well; at its peak, the original \"APHC\" radio program had garnered in excess of four million weekly listeners, and Rivertown Trading Company, the purveyor of \"APHC\"-themed products, was sold in 1998 by Minnesota Public Radio for US $120 million. Sensitive to the potential loss of audience with the change at the helm of the show—Thile has said that he knows he will lose some listeners devoted to Keillor, stating that his “goal is to lose one million… and add two.”—the program's distributor, American Public Media, has indicated its intent to ease listeners completely away from experiencing the earlier Keillor format by \"mix[ing] in\" more than a dozen of the new \"APHC\" programs with Thile, alongside a set of reruns where Keillor is at the helm.\n\nWriting for the \"Chicago Tribune,\" Steve Johnson notes that the new program \"still rel[ies] heavily on an air of authenticity derived from its Minnesota locale, [but] now leans a little more toward music,\" and \"away from storytelling.\" Johnson concludes that the program remains \"an easy, graceful listen\" featuring \"a killer musical repertoire in the Americana tradition,\" and \"humor ranging from corny to cutting.\"\n\nThile's first \"A Prairie Home Companion with Chris Thile\" took place on October 15, 2016 at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul. Thile's opening program featured Jack White and Lake Street Dive as musical guests, and a new Song of the Week.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3250976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3250976", "title": "Mankind (play)", "text": "Mankind (play)\n\nMankind is an English medieval morality play, written . The play is a moral allegory about Mankind, a representative of the human race, and follows his fall into sin and his repentance. Its author is unknown; the manuscript is signed by a monk named Hyngham, believed to have transcribed the play. \"Mankind\" is unique among moralities for its surprising juxtaposition of serious theological matters and colloquial (sometimes obscene) dialogue. Along with the morality plays \"Wisdom\" and \"The Castle of Perseverance\", \"Mankind\" belongs to the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. as a part of the Macro Manuscript (so named after 18th century owner Cox Macro).\n\nIn his critical edition of the play published by the Early English Text Society in 1969, Eccles argues for a date between 1465 and 1470. Wickham, in his Dent edition of 1976, agrees, finally settling on 1470. Similarly, Lester, in his New Mermaids edition of 1981, offers between 1464 and 1471. Baker and, following his suggestion, Southern agree on a date of 1466. These arguments are based upon references to coinage in the playtext, specifically the \"royal\" and the \"angel\", which were minted between 1465 – 1470. The poem certainly dates from the reign of Edward IV of England, and likely has an East Anglian provenance; it was likely \"intended to be performed in the area around Cambridge and the environs of Lynn in Norfolk.\" This is evidenced by numerous local place names dispersed throughout the play, including that of Bury St Edmunds, significant for being the home of two former owners of the play: Thomas Hyngman (15th century) and Cox Macro (18th century).\n\nLike \"Wisdom\", \"Mankind\" bears a Latin inscription by the monk Thomas Hyngman and the phrase (translated), “Oh book, if anyone shall perhaps ask to whom you belong, you will say, “I belong above everything to Hyngham, a monk.” Similarities between this hand and the text of the play lead scholars to believe that Hyngman transcribed the play. However, several textual oddities likely derive from Hyngman's miscopying of the text because he was unfamiliar with it, so scholars do not credit Hyngman with authorship.\n\nAlong with \"The Castle of Perseverance\" and \"Wisdom\", Hyngman's \"Mankind\" was acquired by the Reverend Cox Macro in the early 18th century. Macro bound them together somewhat arbitrarily, along with three other non-dramatic manuscripts. Early 19th-century owner Henry Gurney separated \"The Castle\", \"Wisdom\", and \"Mankind\" from the other manuscripts and bound them together as a collection in a separate volume. In 1936, the Folger Shakespeare Library purchased this manuscript at a Sotheby's auction for 440 pounds.\n\nThe play is a moral allegory about Mankind, a representative of the human race, and follows his fall into sin and his repentance. The audience is instructed in the proper Christian life by watching Mankind's fall and redemption.\n\nThe play begins with Mercy, who instructs the audience in how they should behave but is soon interrupted by Mischief (whose name indicates, in fifteenth-century English, something much more serious than the 'prank' it means now). Mischief mocks Mercy's preaching. A page is then missing in the manuscript. When the play resumes, Mischief has departed and New Guise (i.e., 'Fashion), Nowadays (i.e. 'living for today') and Nought (i.e. 'nothingness') are on stage. They continue the mockery of Mercy. After their exit, Mercy again addresses the audience, explaining why the three are evil and urging the audience to not follow their example.\n\nMankind enters, and addresses the audience, introducing himself. He is a farmer, and is resolved to live a virtuous life. Mercy instructs Mankind about how to continue in this goal, warning him specifically about Mischief, New Guise, Nowadays and Nought. But Mankind has to stand against temptation on his own, and so Mercy leaves.\n\nNew Guise, Nowadays and Nought return to tempt Mankind. First, they encourage the audience to join in with a scatological song. Then they turn their attention to Mankind, but he successfully resists their enticements and beats them off with his spade.\n\nMischief returns and conspires with New Guise, Nowadays and Nought to bring in a greater devil, Titivillus. But first, they demand that the audience pay money before they can see Titivillus. When the audience does so, Titivillus enters, and begins immediately making Mankind's life difficult. The audience can see him, but he is invisible to Mankind. He hardens the ground, making it hard to farm. He steals Mankind's seed and spade. He induces a need to urinate. He distracts him from his prayers. Finally Mankind becomes so frustrated that he gives up and goes to sleep, and Titivillus whispers to him that Mercy is dead. Through his scene, Titivillus implores the audience to keep silent and watch him, which makes the audience complicit in his actions.\n\nThus deluded, Mankind rejects Mercy and goes to join New Guise, Nowadays and Nought. But now their full evil is revealed. Mischief has been in jail, and has escaped, robbed the jailer, and raped his wife. New Guise has narrowly escaped hanging. Nowadays has robbed a church. The three have Mankind swear vows to join their gang, vows which also show their depravity—to be a highway robber, to seduce women, to 'rob, steal, and kill as fast as you may go' (708). When they leave, Mercy returns to plead with the audience about the unreliability of Mankind, and to pray for his redemption.\n\nThe three reveal to Mankind that Mercy is not really dead, and tempt him to kill himself rather than face Mercy. But Mercy chases them away.\n\nThe final struggle for Mankind's redemption is with himself. Mercy tells him all that he must do to be forgiven is to ask, but Mankind finds this difficult and raises a series of objections. The theology of the ending focuses on perseverance, on living as a Christian even while continuing to sin, even while trying not to, and having to repeatedly ask for mercy for those offences. Mankind finally accepts Mercy, and then promptly tries to blame the devils for his problems, but Mercy reminds him that he warned Mankind about them. For the play ends with Mercy addressing the audience again, exhorting them to repentance.\n\nLike other moralities, \"Mankind\" dramatizes the struggle over humanity between the forces of good and evil. Within this larger thematic structure, scholars have been fascinated by the comedic and potentially subversive tone of the play. The play is interested in the humor of transgression – five out of seven speaking roles are comic villains, making \"Mankind\" the lightest and most colloquial of the Macro plays. At the same time, the play places a remarkable emphasis on language. Greene argues that Titivillus and the vices under his command reduce Mankind to the level of a dumb beast, lost and on the brink of damnation, by drawing him into their perverse, topsy-turvy distortions of language. In his introduction to Furnivall's edition, Pollard writes that the \"low tone\" of the play is due to its nature as an economic venture, since the tone appealed to the largely uneducated common audiences for whom players performed. Eccles notes that \"Mankind\" is the first English play to \"mention gathering money from an audience\". Indeed, the play calls for a relatively significant amount of audience participation, as in the scene where New Guise, Nowadays and Naught cajole the audience into singing obscene carols with them. Ashley notes that in this way, \"the audience itself is tricked into complicity with the devil’s machinations against Mankind.\"\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1950 by a group of young bibliophiles headed by John Granger, Bent Juel-Jensen and R. John Rickett, and the first meeting was held in Hilary Term of 1951. For fifty years the Society held regular lectures, visits and other events during the University terms, and many of the leading bibliographers, librarians, book collectors, booksellers and other literary figures of the period spoke to the Society or hosted visits. Many of the Society's junior members went on to become prominent figures in the world of books, and some later served as senior members of the Society. One of the most influential members was John Sparrow, Warden of All Souls, who encouraged a love of books and manuscripts in a generation of students, and hosted a termly \"Warden's Meeting\" at which members were encouraged to bring items from their own libraries to pass round and say a few words about; the tradition of the \"Warden's Meeting\" continued after 1986, when the Warden himself was too ill to host the meetings and, indeed, after his death in 1992. Another of the Society's traditions was the quality of the termly programme cards, often produced by the leading printers and private presses of the age, including the Oxford and Cambridge University Presses, the Rampant Lions Press, the Samson Press, the Fantasy Press, the Kit-Cat Press, Big Wheel Press, the Perpetua Press, the Incline Press, the Whittington Press, the Libanus Press, the Rocket Press, the Stanbrook Abbey Press and the Stamperia Valdonega.\n\nAfter a period of difficulties and disrupted activities in the last decade of the twentieth century, the Society closed in 2000, when interest among the students had declined so far that a junior committee could no longer be formed. However, due to the efforts of a new generation of Oxford students led by Geri Della Rocca de Candal, Enrico Emanuele Prodi and Matthew Cheung Salisbury, aided by Cristina Dondi, Richard Ovenden and a few surviving members of the former Society (notably Colin Franklin and Paul W. Nash), the Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles was refounded in Trinity term 2008 and became fully active in Michaelmas term in the same year. The first termcard for the new Society was printed by the Rampant Lions Press (and was among the last jobs printed by Sebastian Carter).\n\nThe Society's device, shown opposite, was designed by Michael Harvey.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Performance surfaces are normally laid on top of, or are part of, a sprung floor to produce a complete dance floor or sports floor.\n\nDance performance surfaces made of sheet vinyl are also called dance floors and marley floors. They are called marley-type floors from a very popular reversible vinyl flooring manufactured for years until about 1978 by Marley Floors Ltd.\n\nTheatres often have a number of roll-out floors with different characteristics to satisfy the requirements of different forms of dance.\n\nThis article deals mainly with the customization of a floor for different activities by the use of different surfaces. The sprung floor article deals with the basic requirements and construction of floors to make them suitable for dance and indoor sports.\n\nThe sprung floor article outlines some of the different standards with regards to the performance surface of a sports floor. Below are some of the key factors that can influence the performance surface required within a sports facility.\n\nA sprung floor with a hard surface provides protection from serious injuries rather than minor injuries. A fall can still cause bruises. A soft performance surface on the other hand can provide protection from minor injuries but not serious injuries. Providing sufficient protection from serious injury for adults using a thick performance surface alone would render it unsuitable for most dance or sport. This is because a performance surface is point elastic whereas area elasticity as provided by a sprung floor is mainly preferred.\n\nIn general, dance requires less traction than gym. However a floor should not of itself be very slippery or sticky. DIN 18032 defines a range of traction which should suit most activities. These type of floors should also be smooth, and a slide should not cause carpet burn. This means it is difficult to stop them from becoming slippery when wet.\n\nMost of the differences between the different disciplines can and should be catered for by the use of appropriate shoes. On the same surface, a dance shoe with a leather or suede sole will give much less traction than a gym shoe with a composite rubber sole. A sticky floor used for gym is very likely to cause twisted ankles, and a slippery floor used for dancing is liable to cause bad falls.\n\nEveryday footwear nowadays tends to have a higher traction. For occasions like weddings, where the dancers may not have proper footwear, a slightly slippier floor could compensate somewhat, but a highly polished floor can be very dangerous with leather soles. Both gyms and dance clubs are better off providing good safe floors and encouraging the use of proper footwear.\n\nThe performance surface is normally of vinyl or hardwood, engineered wood or laminate. For dance the surface may be replaceable so for instance a theatre can adapt easily to either ballet or tap dance, these are normally made of vinyl sheeting. Hardwood is however preferred for tap dance. Some sports have extra requirements like spike resistance or a standard ball bounce.\n\nRoll-up vinyl sheeting normally consists of:\n\n\nWhen rolled up the vinyl should not be bent sharply - it should be on rolls. When there are a number of different surfaces for a hall these can be kept on special storage carts which keep them separate rather than lying on each other.\n\nA wood surface is ideal for social dancing if maintained properly and is also standard for many indoor sports. Engineered wood is normally used nowadays for wood flooring as it is less liable to warp or shrink and is more economic. Tap dance is especially punishing and a tough hardwood surface like oak or maple is preferred for any regular use.\n\nVinyl is a better choice for other types of dance or more general community use. The requirements for different types of dance are different, but the differences can mostly be accommodated by changes in the dance surface. For instance Riverdance requires a harder surface that makes a sound, Ballet requires a softer surface because of the high jumps and possibility of falls. Ballroom dancing requires less traction than Scottish country dancing.\n\nIt used to be difficult to maintain a wood floor properly. However, if the directions of the floor manufacturer are followed properly modern treatments will maintain a good surface. It is important not to just trust a commercial office cleaner to know how to do a good job, they should be instructed to follow the directions. There are no cheap and foolproof machines around for measuring traction which would enable cleaners to see their work conforms to dance or sports requirements. Thus there is a very strong inclination for managers or cleaners to go for other requirements e.g. a shiny surface or one that resists dirt better.\n\nIf a floor is occasionally used for public events, e.g. a gym hall used for a graduation ceremony, then a gym floor cover can be used to protect the floor and ease the normal requirements.\n\nTo maintain good traction it is important to stop the floor getting dirty or even slightly wet. A good floor cleaning regime and insisting on sports or dance shoes will help with this. The main protection though is to ensure the hall has industrial grade barrier matting at the entrance. The building should also have a floor grate at the entrance.\n"}

The film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Shannon, Dania Ramirez and Jamie Chung. It follows a bicycle messenger chased around New York City by a corrupt police officer who wants an envelope the messenger has. It was released on August 24, 2012 by Columbia Pictures.\n\nThe film has a nonlinear narrative. It contains numerous flash-forward and flashback cuts, indicated with an overlaid digital clock showing the time advancing rapidly forward/backward to the next scene. In chronological order:\n\nWilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a disenchanted Columbia Law School graduate who has put off taking the bar exam because he could not bear to enter the humdrum life of the legal profession. He finds meaning and purpose in being employed as a thrill-seeking New York City bicycle messenger despite arguments with his girlfriend and fellow bike messenger, Vanessa (Dania Ramirez), who insists that he should make something of himself.\n\nVanessa's roommate, Nima (Jamie Chung), has asked Vanessa to move out for a personal reason she doesn't disclose. Vanessa is in the process of packing her few belongings. Nima delivers $50,000 that she has saved for two years to Mr. Leung (Henry O), a Chinese hawaladar, in exchange for a ticket that she must deliver to Sister Chen, buying a place for Nima's son and mother in one of Sister Chen's ships on which gangs smuggle people from China to the United States.\n\nMr. Lin, a local loan shark, has learned of the ticket and that whoever returns it to Mr. Leung can collect Nima's money. He approaches Robert \"Bobby\" Monday (Michael Shannon), a gambling-addicted NYPD detective who owes him money, offering to clear Monday's debt if Monday gets him the ticket. Monday begins searching for Nima, who decides to hire Wilee to deliver the envelope with the ticket to Sister Chen by 7 pm after Nima is told by Leung that anyone who knew she was visiting him is a loose end which could cause her to be in possible danger if she tries to deliver the ticket herself. Wilee and Nima conduct their transaction at the college where Nima is a student. After Wilee leaves, Nima is confronted by Monday, who sees the courier receipt Wilee gave her. He is able to steal the receipt from Nima. After Monday leaves, Vanessa finds Nima, and learns the contents of the envelope.\n\nMonday catches up with Wilee before he leaves the college campus, stating that he is a college official, that Nima had no authority to handle the contents of the envelope on the college's behalf, and that he would like the envelope back, with the receipt Wilee gave to Nima in his hands. Wilee refuses. He is able to escape, with Monday in pursuit. Wilee heads to the police station to report Monday, only to find out he's a police detective. Wilee hides in the bathroom, where he opens the envelope and finds the ticket.\n\nAfter he escapes the station, Wilee angrily tells his dispatcher, Raj (Aasif Mandvi), that he is returning the package so that someone else can drop it off. Returning to Nima's college, Wilee leaves the envelope, which is picked up by his rival, Manny (Wolé Parks). Before Manny picks it up, however, Monday calls the dispatch to redirect the delivery to a different address.\n\nAs he is about to leave the college after returning the envelope, Wilee runs into Nima. He confronts her about the ticket, and she reveals the truth. Guilt-ridden, Wilee tries to catch up to Manny, who refuses to give Wilee his drop. They race each other and in the process, are chased by a bike cop who had earlier tried to arrest Wilee. As they approach Monday's location, the bike cop tackles Manny off his bike and arrests him. Vanessa, who learns of Monday's trickery and races over to warn Manny, appears, grabs Manny's bag and gives it to Wilee.\n\nAs they are about to escape, Wilee is hit by an oncoming taxi. He falls to the ground fracturing some ribs in the process. He is put in an ambulance with Monday, while his damaged bike is taken to an impound lot, with the envelope hidden in the handlebars. Monday tortures Wilee by pressing on his injured ribs, and Wilee offers to give Monday the envelope in exchange for his bike.\n\nWilee tells Monday that the envelope is in Manny's bag, and Monday leaves to search it, while Wilee meets with Vanessa in the impound lot. She gives him the envelope, which she had retrieved, and he escapes on a stolen bike. Monday, realizing Wilee has tricked him, pursues Wilee to Sister Chen's place. Meanwhile, Nima calls Mr. Leung for help. He deploys his enforcer, the Sudoku Man, to help her.\n\nAs Wilee reaches Chinatown, he is confronted by Monday, who is threatening to kill him. However, Vanessa arrives with a flash mob of messengers, dispatched by Raj, who delay Monday by hitting him numerous times, giving Wilee time to deliver the ticket to Sister Chen just before the stroke of 7 pm. She calls the captain of her ship and tells him to allow Nima's family aboard. Outside, Monday is confronted by the Sudoku Man, who shoots Monday in the back of his head with a silenced pistol. Dying and feeling faint, Monday tries to get in his car saying that he just wants to think for a second, but dies before he can do so. Nima's mother calls her and confirms that she and Nima's son have gotten on the ship. Nima meets with Wilee and Vanessa while they are finally reunited again.\n\nPrincipal photography began in mid-July 2010 and ended by early September 2010 in New York City. Gordon-Levitt was injured during filming on August 1, 2010, when he rode into the back of a taxi. The impact sent Gordon-Levitt flying into the rear windshield of the taxi, slashing his arm which required 31 stitches. A shot of the aftermath of that accident is included as a scene during the credits of the film. Locations included Columbia University, Central Park and Canal Street.\n\nIn 2011, a lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California by author Joe Quirk, claiming \"Premium Rush\" was based on his 1998 novel \"The Ultimate Rush\". The suit claimed many plot, character name, and scene similarities to Quirk's original novel. In July 2012, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg declined to dismiss Quirk's claim that Sony Pictures, parent company of Columbia Pictures, had breached an implied contract. The production company Pariah, director David Koepp and co-screenwriter John Kamps are also named in the suit. On April 2, 2013, Judge Seeborg dismissed this case, finding that the two works were not substantially similar.\n\nIn its opening weekend, \"Premium Rush\" opened at #8, grossing $6 million. The film grossed $20.3 million in North America while grossing $10.8 million in foreign markets, totaling a worldwide income of $31.1 million, against a production budget of $35 million.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 158 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"It's built out of familiar parts, but no matter how formulaic \"Premium Rush\"'s storyline might seem, it's elevated by high-octane action and enjoyable performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 66 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 stars out of 4, calling it a \"breakneck chase movie\".\n\n"}

It began on Friday, March 2, 2007, because Saint Patrick's Day fell during spring break, which would have left students unable to celebrate the holiday while at school and with friends. The first annual State Patty's Day (so named because the students replaced Saint with State in the name of the holiday) took place on March 2, 2007. Students began flocking the streets of downtown State College, and bars and restaurants in the area opened early to take advantage of the holiday.\n\nIn subsequent years State Patty's Day has been scheduled for the weekend after THON, giving the event a standardized date. As of 2014, it has persisted as an annual event, attracting more tourism to downtown State College than Saint Patrick's Day itself.\n\nState Patty's Day made its debut in early 2007 after a handful of students realized that the school's spring break would conflict with St. Patrick's Day. Utilizing Facebook, they created a group entitled \"The Official Group to Move St. Patrick's Day.\" Their hope was to unify the student body in early celebration. With an excess of over 4,600 members in 2008, along with an effort to get bars in downtown State College involved, the group was successful in moving the holiday to Friday March 2, a day that has been dubbed as State Patty's Day. Currently, the State Patty's Day Event Page has grown to nearly 12,000 followers.\n\nThe holiday has grown to such an extent that it attracts a significant number of out-of-town visitors; in 2011, nearly 60% of day's 234 arrests were for visitors. In 2012, the number reported was just under 20%.\n\nMagisterial District Judge Carmine Prestia, who serves as president of the Centre County magisterial district judges, has instituted a policy whereby alternative adjudications, resulting in dismissal of summary offense charges, are not available for offenses occurring during State Patty's Day weekend. The effort was made in an attempt to discourage illegal activities and to try to make the event seem less appealing to out-of-town attendees.\n\nIn 2013, after seeing the event continue to grow in size and popularity, the Borough of State College and Penn State University attempted to squash the notorious holiday by offering a $5,000 subsidy to all alcohol-serving establishments in the downtown area, in exchange for closing their doors or ceasing alcohol sales on the day of the event. In total, $170,000 of revenue from parking fees earned from previous State Patty's days was spent to keep establishments from selling alcohol on the day of the event.\n\nThe previous two years, State College Borough had issued a \"State Patty's Day After Action Report\" outlining the financial impact of the event. Both reports showed that the weekend was extremely busy but, over-all wasn't all that different from weekends when Penn State Football held home games. The reports also showed that the net result from the event for both years yielded an excess revenue of $15,144 & $14,479.25 after all expenses. The After Action Report for the year in which the $170,000 was spent was either not conducted or not released.\n\nInitially, bars in downtown State College opened early and welcomed revelers; however, each year has seen a decrease in the number of bars willing to stay open, as local governance has asked them to cut back due to the nuisance it creates on town resources and local law enforcement.\n\nThe holiday sees a significant spike in law-enforcement incidents, a trend that has slightly abated. Starting in 2012, the holiday was banned among campus fraternities and sororities.\n\nIn February 2013, just weeks before the event, a committee of university, community, and student leaders created an agreement with three dozen restaurant and beer shops in the area to halt alcohol sales during the drinking holiday. In exchange each business was to receive a $5,000 subsidy to account for lost revenue. Many bar owners had voiced criticism that they had felt \"extreme pressure\" to close their doors and accept the terms of the deal. Although the subsidy was intended to off-set the financial loss as a result of the closures, the loss of revenue for the employees of the establishments went unaddressed, leaving upwards of 200 bar & restaurant employees without work on what would otherwise be a busy and lucrative Saturday night.\n\nIn an apparent lack of support, the State College Tavern Owners Association preemptively elected to reject any proposals made from the University or Borough of State College for the 2014 incarnation of State Patty's Day that would close their businesses. Accordingly, at the UPUA meeting on Jan. 22nd, the motions that were proposed to adopt the University's stance on State Patty's day were amended to reflect the lack of unity on the subject.\n\n"}
{"id": "1341539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1341539", "title": "Tahtib", "text": "Tahtib\n\nTahtib (Egyptian Arabic: تحطيب \"taḥṭīb\") is the term for a traditional stick-fighting martial art originally named \"fan a'nazaha wa-tahtib\" (\"the art of being straight and honest through the use of stick\"). The original martial version of tahtib later evolved into an Egyptian folk dance with a wooden stick. It is commonly described in English as a \"stick dance\", \"cane dance\", \"stick-dancing game\", or as ritual mock combat accompanied by music. Nowadays, the word \"tahtib\" encompasses both martial practice and performance art. It is mainly practiced today in Upper Egypt. A Nubian form of tahtib is regularly performed for tourists in Aswan.\n\nThe stick used in tahtib is about four feet in length and is called an \"asa\", \"asaya\", \"assaya\", or \"nabboot\". It is often flailed in large figure-eight patterns across the body with such speed that the displacement of air is loudly discernible.\n\nThe oldest traces of tahtib were found on engravings from the archaeological site of Abusir, an extensive necropolis of the Old Kingdom period, located in the south-western suburbs of Cairo. On some of the reliefs of the Pyramid of Sahure (V dynasty, c. 2500 BC); the images and explanatory captions are particularly precise and accurate in their depiction of what seems to be military training using sticks. Tahtib, with archery and wrestling, was then among the three disciplines of warfare taught to soldiers.\n\nThree of the 35 tombs of the Beni Hassan necropolis (XI-XII Dynasties, 1900 – 1700 BC) near the town of Minya, contain engravings showing scenes of tahtib. Similar engravings can be seen in the archaeological site of Tell el Amarna (XVIII Dynasty, 1350 BC), some 60 km south of Minya. In addition to its role as military training, tahtib matches were also popular among peasants and farmers. The first evidence of the festive representation of tahtib can only be seen in the New Empire (1500 – 1000 BC), as shown by the engravings on the walls of Luxor and Saqqâra Early Christian writings mention tahtib as a leisure activity and a popular art performed by men during weddings and celebrations. It is believed that tahtib developed as a game or performance art in this civilian context.\n\nAs with its combative counterpart, the dance form of tahtib was originally performed by men, but female versions were later developed. In one form, the women dress as men and imitate the males. Another female variant is performed flirtatiously and with less aggression. The latter, called \"ra's el assaya\" (dance of the stick) is incorporated into cabaret or Raqs sharqi performances. The stick used for this dance is generally more lightweight and hooked at one end like a cane. It is often embellished with metallic-coloured foil or sequins. The costume is a simple baladi dress. Performances include balancing the cane on the head, hip or shoulder.\n\nMusic in tahtib features the \"tahvol\" (bass drum) and mizmar (folk oboe). The right hand uses a heavier stick with a hooked head to beat out the \"dum\" (the deep sound from striking the center of the drum) which drive the heartbeat of the rhythm, while the left hand uses a light twig as a switch to produce rapid-fire staccato \"taks\" (the higher sound from striking the edge of the drum).\n\nModern tahtib is an attempt to re-explore the sources of tahtib as a fighting art, and to enrich them as a martial practice by codifying the techniques and teaching them structurally. As in traditional tahtib, the main target is the opponent's head, as it is considered the most fragile and vulnerable part of the body. Consequently, techniques revolve around protecting one's own head while reaching the head of the opponent. Victory can be attained either by a single clean touch to the head, or three touches to the body. Unlike its traditional counterpart, modern tahtib allows both women and men to practice in mixed groups.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1247171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1247171", "title": "The Christian Harmony", "text": "The Christian Harmony\n\nThe Christian Harmony is a shape note hymn and tune book compiled by William Walker. The book was released in 1866 (1867 according to some sources). It is part of the larger tradition of shape note singing.\n\nWilliam Walker was born in 1809 in South Carolina, and grew up near Spartanburg. He became a Baptist song leader and shape note \"singing master.\" Walker and Benjamin Franklin White, publisher of \"The Sacred Harp\", married sisters. In 1835, Walker published a tunebook entitled \"The Southern Harmony\" in four-shape (fasola) notation. He incorporated over half of the contents of this \"Southern Harmony\" into his \"Christian Harmony\" in 1866. For \"The Christian Harmony\", Walker changed from the four-shape system to a seven-shape (doremi) system. Retaining the original four shapes of the Southern Harmony, he devised three other shapes of his own. In defending his change from the four-shape system which he had previously championed, Walker explained that parents wouldn't name seven children with only four names. A second edition was released in 1873. William Walker died on September 24, 1875.\n\nBefore the publication of a combined new edition of \"The Christian Harmony\" in 2010, two editions were in use - the \"Carolina book\" or \"Walker book,\" and the \"Alabama book\" or \"Deason book.\"\n\nThe books used in western North Carolina and adjacent areas were 1979, 1994, and 2002 reprints of Walker's 1873 edition of the Christian Harmony. None of the old songs were changed in the new reprint; four songs and some commentary were added.\n\nThe \"Alabama\" edition was a revision carried out under the leadership of O. A. Parris and John H. Deason and published in 1958. This edition utilized Jesse B. Aikin's seven-shape system; this change was made because Aikin's system was the most common among gospel singers in the South. In addition to changing to the Aikin notation, the 1958 revision deleted some songs and added new ones:\nWe have removed from the old book 179 songs. These will found to be the songs very rarely if ever used. We have changed numbers on but 34 songs and in all cases this was not easily avoidable. On 37 of these songs we have given them more room in order that they may be more easily read. We have included 102 songs both old and new that we feel will help very much to make a better and more useful book. (Preface to 1958 edition)\nIt was used mainly in Alabama and Mississippi. Revisions of the \"Alabama\" book were released in 1994, with a few song changes and corrections, and again in 2002.\n\nThe 2010 edition contains 672 songs. The book is newly typeset and uses the Aikin seven-shape system.\n\nPages 1–381 largely reproduce the contents and pagination of the 1958 Alabama book. Pages 397–541t contain songs present in the Carolina book but omitted by the 1958 revisers, in order (approximately 200 songs). (Pages 388, 393b, and 545b also contain music from the Carolina book, out of order.) Pages 382, 384–385, 543–545t, 546–548, and 549b (the final song in the book) contain new music not included in the Carolina book or in the 1958 Alabama book. The remaining twelve and a half pages consist of songs from the 1958 Alabama book that have been moved for a more spacious layout.\n\nIn 1933, George Pullen Jackson reported on \"Christian Harmony\" singings in four states: South Carolina (in and around Spartanburg and in York, Union, and Greenville counties), North Carolina (Rutherford and Buncombe counties), southern Missouri (a tradition of singings stretching back to 1889), and Alabama (56 singings in 1932 in \"nine mid-state counties\"). The publisher, the E.W. Miller Company of Philadelphia, reported sales largely limited to the Spartanburg area at that time.\n\nOnline minutes record 43 singings from \"The Christian Harmony\" in 2010 (12 in North Carolina, nine in Alabama, six in Georgia, six in Virginia, five in South Carolina, three in Tennessee, one in Mississippi, and one in Texas) and 23 singings in 2011 (11 in North Carolina, three in South Carolina, three in Tennessee, three in Georgia, two in Alabama, and one in Arkansas). Camp DoReMi, a summer singing school in Little Switzerland, North Carolina, is held annually and uses both \"The Christian Harmony\" and the \"New Harp of Columbia\".\n\nThe Newton County, Mississippi, Christian Harmony Convention was organized in 1875 and is believed to be the oldest continuing Christian Harmony convention. This singing has evolved or preserved some distinctive traditional features, such as a sustained ringing style of singing, and the use of \"The Drone\" as a closing song.\n\nA singing tradition with deep roots continues in Haywood and Transylvania counties, North Carolina. Old Folks Day in Canton has featured singing from the \"Christian Harmony\" since the nineteenth century, at the Morning Star Methodist Church, and before that at the Locust Field Church (now the First Baptist Church). The twice-yearly Etowah singing, now held in Horseshoe, N.C., has been held since 1909.\n\nOn Sunday 27 October 2013 the first Christian Harmony All-Day Singing in Europe took place at St Mary's Church in Primrose Hill, hosted by the Sacred Harp Singers of London, who now regularly sing from the 2010 edition of Walker's Christian Harmony. In attendance were Sacred Harp singers from the UK & Ireland, Europe, and the US. The event is scheduled to take place that same Sunday in October 2014 at the same venue.\n\n\n"}

It was one of the longest-running scripted television programs in Latvia, airing nearly every weekday from March 15, 2009. It last aired on 19 May 2017. UgunsGrēks was the sequel to the LTV1 show \"The Cost of Frenzy\" (Latvian: \"Neprāta cena\").\n\nThe show was created by Inta Gorodecka and Baiba Saleniece. The show’s storylines were written by Inta Bernova and Gunta Kalniņa. The program featured an ensemble cast, headed by its longest-serving actors Ģirts Ķesteris as Leons Timmermanis, Jakovs Rafalsons as Vadims Felzenbahers, Zane Daudziņa as Helēna Felzenbahere, Ilze Vzdika as Milda Upīte, Egīls Melnbārdis as Gunārs Liepiņš, Uldis Dumpis as Aivars Pētersons and Regīna Devīte as Zenta Upīte. In 2014, the show was the most-watched soap opera in Latvia, with an audience of an estimated 1 762 000 viewers. The series ended in May 2017 and was replaced by \"Svešā seja\", which was produced by the same creative team.\n\nThe storyline of \"UgunsGrēks\" began in 2006 with the TV series called \"The Cost of Frenzy\" (Latvian: Neprāta cena). In the March of 2009 only ten days before the expected series premiere, TV3 Latvia came out with disclaimer that \"The Cost of Frenzy\" would no longer be broadcast on the LTV1 network and would now be shown on TV3 Latvia and that its new name would be \"UgunsGrēks\". The new concept brought new characters and original storylines.\n\n\"UgunsGrēks\" ended on May 19, 2017. After 17 seasons, the show's creators decided that it was time for the most popular show in Latvia to end. \"UgunsGrēks\" final episode was 2 hours long and after that TV3 Latvia showed special live broadcast from the casts after party with actors from all the seasons. The creative team then began work on a new daily soap opera called \"Svešā seja\", which premiered on September 18, 2017 in the same time slot that \"Ugunsgrēks\" had aired. \"Svešā seja\" did not find the same success that \"Ugunsgrēks\" had enjoyed, and was cancelled less than a year later on May 17, 2018.\n\nWhen the Ugunsgrēks premiered in 2009, the TV series revolved around the tragedies and triumphs of the Pētersons family, their friends and enemies in little city near the sea where the Pētersons family-owned a hotel. Storylines in the show followed the lives of residents of the Peterson hotel with the usual threads of love, marriage, divorce, family life, and the intrigue of the resort's ownership.\n\nOver time, new families with their own hotels were brought to the show to interact with the Peterson family and serve as competitors for more dramatic storylines. One of the longest-running storylines involved a doctor named Leon, his love life and happiness. From the beginning until the 9th season of the series Leon was the main leading male character in Ugunsgrēks. This plot-line was made even more complex when the love of his life Marta Peterson played by Dita Lūriņa was killed in the bomb explosion. After this accident, Leon was left blind and alone. The 9th Season he finally found his true love and married his love interest for 4 seasons – Elizabete Ziemele played by Maija Doveika. After this, Leon went to Germany and his storyline ended.\n\nWith Leon’s storyline ending, the viewers were introduced with Leons daughter Ieva Timmermane played by Inga Tropa. Ieva became even more involved in the storyline as the series showed the audience Āboltiņi family who had built a new hotel Mare SPA near the Peterson resort. A love triangle between Ieva and two sons from Aboltiņi family lasted for 3 seasons. The story-line culminated when in the 12th Season Ieva went back to England and choose none of the brothers.\n\nWhen \"Ugunsgrēks\" debuted, the cast consisted of six main characters (Leons Timmermanis, Marta Pētersone, Aivars Pētersons, Oto Pētersons, Elza Timmermane, Rihards Baumanis). As the show continued, the cast increased to 12 actors, and more in the next years. Throughout the show's run, there were over 200 actors that had a role in the TV series. From the all actors in the most episodes viewers can see Ģirts Ķesteris, because he has been in the most episodes from the beginning of the show.\n\nOriginal cast member Mārtiņs Freimanis who played Oto Pētersons remained on contract with Ugunsgrēks until his sudden death on 27 January 2011. In the series, Martiņš Freimanis' character, Oto moved to England and was never heard from again.\n\nCast member Ģirts Ķesteris holds the record for appearing in the most episodes since the beginning of the series. The actor played two roles: Leons Timmernanis, the hotel doctor, and the role of his long lost twin brother Fēlikss Seņkovs from Russia.\n\nIn last years of the Ugunsgrēks casting director hired many new cast member to appeal to younger viewers. The new cast members were Vanda Saulīte (Dārta Daneviča), Signe Kļaviņa (Anta Aizupe), Sandija (Marija Linarte) Olafs Birznieks, (Gints Andžāns).\n\n\nAccording to MTG TV LATVIA, \"UgunsGrēks\" was the most widely distributed soap opera and TV show in Latvia with episodes not just broadcast via TV3 Latvia, but also via Kanals2 and as of June 2012, episodes were offered via TV3play.\n\nThis series aired only four days of the week and consisted of 5 main characters (Aurēlija Anužīte as Anna Pētersone, Juris Žagarsas Roberts, Ģirts Ķesteris as Leons Timmermanis, Kristīne Nevarauska as Līga, Jakovs Rafalsons as Vadims Felzenbahers.\n\nThis mini-series was shown on channel TV3 from 2013 August to October 2013.

In all other variants of Watten, the 7 of Bells is the \"Weli\".\n\nThe \"Weli\" is also often called the \"Welli\" or \"Belli\" and, dialectically, the \"Wöli\", \"Wöüli\" or \"Belle\". The name \"Weli\" probably comes from the Italian word \"belli\", which means \"bells\".\n\nHistorically the \"Weli\" is first recorded in the early 1850s, when a Bozen card manufacturer inscribed \"WELLI\" onto the six of bells. As early as 1855, the \"Weli\" was integrated in the Salzburg pattern as the 6 of Bells. The gravestone appearing in many depictions is probably the grave of the Apostle Paul.\n\nIn the games of Watten, Bieten, and Perlaggen, the \"Weli\" acts as a wild card, something which is illustrated by the depiction of two other suits (Acorns and Hearts) on the card and by its special design (it is the only playing card with a name).
