{"id": "200626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=200626", "title": "Adaptation (film)", "text": "Adaptation (film)\n\nAdaptation. is a 2002 American comedy-drama metafilm directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman. It is based on Susan Orlean's non-fiction book \"The Orchid Thief\", with numerous self-referential events added, and stars Nicolas Cage as Kaufman and his fictional twin brother Donald, Meryl Streep as Orlean, and Chris Cooper as John Laroche, with Cara Seymour, Brian Cox, Tilda Swinton, Ron Livingston, and Maggie Gyllenhaal in supporting roles.\n\n\"Adaptation\" had been in development as far back as 1994. Jonathan Demme brought the project to Columbia Pictures with Kaufman writing the script. Kaufman experienced writer's block and did not know what to think of \"The Orchid Thief\"; he ultimately wrote a script based on his experience of adapting the book into a screenplay. Jonze signed to direct, and filming was finished in June 2001. Although it is billed as an adaptation of \"The Orchid Thief\", its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt the book into a film, while dramatizing its events in parallel. \"Adaptation\" also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in \"The Orchid Thief\".\n\n\"Adaptation\" received awards at the 75th Academy Awards, 60th Golden Globe Awards, and 56th British Academy Film Awards, with Cooper winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Kaufman winning the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was ranked in a British Film Institute poll as one of the thirty best films of the 2000s.\n\nThe self-loathing Charlie Kaufman is hired to write the screenplay adaptation for Susan Orlean's \"The Orchid Thief\". Kaufman is going through depression and is not happy that his twin brother, Donald, has moved into his house and is taking advantage of him. Donald decides to become a screenwriter like Charlie and attends one of Robert McKee's famous seminars.\n\nCharlie, who rejects formulaic script writing, wants to ensure that his script is a faithful adaptation of \"The Orchid Thief\". However, he comes to realize that the book does not have a usable narrative and that it is impossible to turn into a film, leaving him with a serious case of writer's block. Already well over his deadline with Columbia Pictures, and despairing at writing his script with self-reference, Charlie travels to New York City to discuss the screenplay with Orlean directly. Unable to face her and with the surprising news that Donald's spec script for a clichéd psychological thriller, called \"The 3\", is selling for six or seven figures, Charlie resorts to attending McKee's seminar in New York and asks him for advice. Charlie ends up asking Donald to join him in New York to assist with the story structure.\n\nDonald pretends to be Charlie and interviews Orlean, but is suspicious of her account of the events of her book because she acts as though she is lying. He and Charlie follow Orlean to Florida where she meets John Laroche, the orchid-stealing protagonist of Orlean's book and her secret lover. It is revealed that the Seminole wanted the ghost orchid in order to manufacture a drug that causes fascination – Laroche introduces this drug to Orlean. After Laroche and Orlean catch Charlie observing them taking the drug and having sex, she decides that Charlie must die.\n\nOrlean forces Charlie at gunpoint to drive to the swamp, where she intends to kill him. Charlie and Donald escape and hide in the swamp, where they resolve their differences and Charlie's problems with women. Laroche accidentally shoots Donald. Fleeing, Charlie and Donald drive off but crash into a ranger's truck – Donald dies in the accident. Charlie runs off into the swamp to hide but is spotted by Laroche. However, Laroche is killed by an alligator before he can kill Charlie.\n\nOrlean is arrested. Charlie reconciles with his mother before telling his former love interest, Amelia, that he is still in love with her. Charlie finishes the script which ends with Charlie in a voice-over announcing the script is finished and that he wants Gérard Depardieu to portray him in the film.\n\nTom Hanks was originally set for the double role of Charlie and Donald Kaufman. \"Variety\" reviewed the film as if Donald were a real person. Cage took the role for a $5 million salary, and wore a fatsuit during filming.\n\nStreep expressed strong interest in the role of Susan Orlean before being cast, and took a salary cut in recognition of the film's budget. John Turturro was approached to portray John Laroche. Cooper strongly considered turning down Laroche, but accepted it after his wife urged him to. Albert Finney, Christopher Plummer, Terence Stamp and Michael Caine were considered for the role of Robert McKee, but McKee personally suggested Brian Cox to filmmakers.\n\nLitefoot and Jay Tavare have small roles as Seminole. John Cusack, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich, Lance Acord and Spike Jonze have uncredited cameos as themselves in scenes where Charlie Kaufman is on the set of \"Being John Malkovich\", which he also wrote. Additional cameos include Doug Jones as explorer Augustus Margary, director Curtis Hanson as Orlean's husband, and David O. Russell as a \"New Yorker\" journalist.\n\nThe idea to do a film adaptation of Susan Orlean's \"The Orchid Thief\" dates back to 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer's block. Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events, and creating a fictional brother named Donald Kaufman. Kaufman put Donald Kaufman's name on the script and dedicated the film to the fictional character. By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script; he turned in a third draft in November 2000.\n\nKaufman explained, \n\n\"Adaptation\" went on fast track in April 2000, with Kaufman making some revisions. Scott Brake of \"IGN\" gave the script a positive review in June 2000, as did Drew \"Moriarty\" McWeeny of \"Ain't It Cool News\" in October. Columbia Pictures committed to North America distribution only after Intermedia came aboard to finance the film in exchange for international distribution rights. Filming started in late March 2001 in Los Angeles, and finished by June. The \"evolution\" fantasy sequence was created by Digital Domain, while Skywalker Sound was responsible for the audio mixing of \"Adaptation\".\nThe makeup effects (the Nicolas Cage double, Chris Cooper's teeth, and the alligator attack) were the handiwork of Makeup Effects Designer Tony Gardner (designer), and his effects company Alterian, Inc.\n\nColumbia Pictures had at one point announced a late 2001 theatrical release date. \"Adaptation\" opened on December 6, 2002 in the United States for a limited release. The film was released nationwide on February 14, 2003, earning $1,130,480 in its opening weekend in 672 theaters. \"Adaptation.\" went on to gross $22.5 million in North America and $10.3 million in foreign countries, coming at a total of $32.8 million.\n\n\"Adaptation\" was released on DVD and VHS by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment in May 2003.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 91% \"Certified Fresh\" rating, based on 198 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Dizzyingly original, the loopy, multi-layered \"Adaptation\" is both funny and thought-provoking.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 83 out of 100, based on 40 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film a perfect four star rating, believing that the film \"leaves you breathless with curiosity, as it teases itself with the directions it might take. To watch the film is to be actively involved in the challenge of its creation.\" He later added the film to his \"Great Movies\" collection. At the end of 2009, Ebert named the film one of the best of the decade. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" also gave the film a four star rating and stated, \"Screenwriting this smart, inventive, passionate and rip-roaringly funny is a rare species. So all praise to Charlie Kaufman, working with director Spike Jonze to create the most original and outrageous film comedy since the two first teamed on \"Being John Malkovich\", in 1999.\" Wesley Morris of \"The Boston Globe\" wrote, \"This is epic, funny, tragic, demanding, strange, original, boldly sincere filmmaking. And the climax, the portion that either sinks the entire movie or self-critically explains how so many others derail, is bananas.\" David Ansen of \"Newsweek\" felt Meryl Streep had not \"been this much fun to watch in years\", while Mike Clark of \"USA Today\" gave a largely negative review, mainly criticizing the ending: \"Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like, this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot.\"\n\nIn a 2005 survey, the Writers Guild of America named Kaufman's screenplay for \"Adaptation\" the 77th best movie screenplay ever written.\n\nHaving been submitted the screenplay for approval, Susan Orlean was strongly opposed to the making of the film; she ended up reluctantly approving its production, and was ultimately very impressed with the final result. In 2012, she stated \"[reading the screenplay] was a complete shock. My first reaction was 'Absolutely not!' They had to get my permission and I just said: 'No! Are you kidding? This is going to ruin my career!' Very wisely, they didn't really pressure me. They told me that everybody else had agreed and I somehow got emboldened. It was certainly scary to see the movie for the first time. It took a while for me to get over the idea that I had been insane to agree to it, but I love the movie now.\"\n\nShe was very appreciative of Streep's portrayal, calling it \"one of my favourite performances by her\" and praising the fact that her version of the character was based not on the real Orlean, but on how Streep imagined Orlean based on \"The Orchid Thief\". Despite the fictional parts of the film, she praised it for being very faithful to the spirit of \"The Orchid Thief\": \"What I admire the most [about the film] is that it's very true to the book's themes of life and obsession, and there are also insights into things which are much more subtle in the book about longing, and about disappointment.\"\n\nFilms\n\nLiterature\n\n"}
{"id": "20681124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20681124", "title": "Arkwright (Open All Hours)", "text": "Arkwright (Open All Hours)\n\nAlbert E. Arkwright, usually referred to simply as Arkwright, is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the British sitcom, \"Open All Hours\", played by Ronnie Barker. Arkwright is the uncle of Granville and the proprietor of an old fashioned Yorkshire corner shop, which in the era of the programme (1970s and 1980s) was a product of a bygone age. Arkwright's signature characteristic is his stutter, which Granville never misses an opportunity to mock.\n\nArkwright is a pragmatic, miserly man with old-fashioned values, whose world seems to stop at his shop door, except for his uncontrollable lust for Nurse Gladys Emmanuel (Lynda Baron), which may prompt him on occasion to wander across the road, usually with a ladder, to gain access to her bedroom window. Arkwright is a devious, and mildly dishonest character, who has many crafty tricks to try to persuade a customer to leave his store having bought at least one thing, and will avoid spending his own money at all cost. He is also very conservative about his savings, keeping some in his pocket wrapped in a fine gold chain, and some in an old, battered Oxo tin that he hides under the kitchen sink. This includes, or so he claims, coins from before 1922, when they were \"solid silver\". He loves money so much that the last time he spent a whole night away from the shop was in 1957, when he went to have his appendix out. The till itself is old fashioned, and possesses a tight spring-clip that regularly puts Granville and his fingers in danger. Arkwright refuses to replace it because of the price of a replacement, and because it prevents people from taking his precious money. Although an avid political commentator, he has few political convictions and never sides with either the left or right wing, instead implying they are all useless. Arkwright does however seem fervently opposed to nationalisation, once commenting \"My top lip went all stiff and dead, as if it had been nationalised.\" His political comments usually show no allegiances, instead making remarks like \"When Wales get home rule, do you think they'll nationalise Clive Jenkins?\"\n\nArkwright maintains an openly polite demeanour around customers, but will often insult those who offend him in a veiled or open manner.\n\nArkwright appears to believe in God, although he is certainly not portrayed as a religious man. Most episodes end with him on the pavement outside the shop during closing time, contemplating the day's events. His thoughts often start with an expression like \"Soon they'll only be me and thee that aren't either nationalised or a limited company.\"\n\nArkwright, like most characters in the series, is a rational, practical man, who shows no signs of any sentimentality, unlike Granville, who seems to dream away most of his days, and longs for a life away from the shop.\n\nArkwright speaks with a stammer, which he acknowledges sometimes makes it difficult to express himself. He often makes his impediment into a joke, for example asking: \"Granville, how do you spell P-p-p-pepper? Is it 6 Ps or 7?\" Granville occasionally mocks his uncle's speech pattern (such as calling the \"weather fore-fore-forecast\" the \"weather twelvecast\", and referring to the \"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-BC\" as morse code), although never in a malicious or hurtful manner. Arkwright was shocked on one occasion to find that he also appears to stutter even when thinking to himself.\n\nBy the time of the 2013 episode \"Still Open All Hours\" and the sequel series of the same name, Arkwright has long since died (Barker died in 2005), but almost all of his personality traits have passed onto Granville. Granville keeps a framed photograph of Arkwright in the shop's kitchen which he occasionally talks to. Several people in the town, including Granville, believe that Arkwright's ghost still haunts the shop, particularly the cash register, attributing events such as the lights switching on and off or the register randomly opening and closing to him.\n\nArkwright's sister, whose name is never known, died shortly after giving birth to Granville. Less as an act of love and more as a source of free labour, Arkwright brought up the child. Arkwright paints a picture of his sister being a floozy and possibly a part-time prostitute. He sees no harm in this, seeing this as an enterprising choice of career. This is often implied by phrases such as \"Just take the man's money and smile Granville, that's what your mother would have done\", \"You're j-just like your mother, happiness is h-horizontal\", or, \"Now, d-don't misunderstand me, s-some people loved dearly! Others used to get it on discount\". Granville once takes a call from someone he addresses as \"Auntie Lily\"; seeing as his father is unknown, this would have to be another sister of Arkwright's. When Granville on occasion badgers his uncle about his own father's unknown identity, he retorts by calling him an \"Hungarian P-p-p-p-p-prince\".\n\nGranville is often made to pay for anything he takes from the shop's shelves, even if Arkwright was the one who gave it to him. In later life, Granville demonstrates a great deal of affection and respect for his uncle after his death, taking comfort in his apparent poltergeist activities around the shop, saying: \"I like having him still around, so long as he pays his own electric.\"\n\nIts never made clear exactly how old Granville is during the original series run, but considering the age of David Jason, its easy to assume that Granville may actually be in his 30s-40s during the 1970s-1980s run.\n\nGladys is a midwife, to whom Arkwright is informally engaged. Their engagement doesn't seem to be serious, however they do seem to be fond of each other. (Their engagement is not mentioned until the end of series one, so for the first few episodes, Arkwright can appear to be a \"sex pest\" to Gladys, to some viewers). Most of the characters who use the shop are old-fashioned, domesticated characters, and while Gladys is very straight forward and Arkwright is somewhat eccentric, she does seem to find company in him, as he is probably more enlightened than most in the area. Gladys always says she won't marry Arkwright until her mother (who is in her eighties) dies, a day that Arkwright seems to look forward to. However, Gladys has also claimed on several occasions that she refrains from marrying him because of his excessively tight-fisted ways or his overworking of Granville. Emmanuel is Arkwright's sexual conquest; although he never manages it in the series, he does come close in the back of a mini van that proves to be too small for the act. Arkwright and Gladys apparently never got married before Arkwright's death; Gladys claims he died to save the cost of the church.\n"}

Compared to other forms of French cooking such as \"nouvelle cuisine\", the dishes are quite fatty and heavily oriented around meat. There are approximately twenty officially certified traditional bouchons, but a larger number of establishments describe themselves using the term.\n\nTypically, the emphasis in a bouchon is not on \"haute cuisine\" but, rather, a convivial atmosphere and a personal relationship with the owner.\n\nThe tradition of bouchons came from small inns visited by silk workers passing through Lyon in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\n\nAccording to the dictionary \"Le petit Robert\", this name derives from the 16th century expression for a bunch of twisted straw. A representation of such bundles began to appear on signs to designate the restaurants and, by metonymy, the restaurants themselves became known as bouchons. The more common use of \"bouchons\" as a stopper or cork at the mouth of a bottle, and its derivatives, have the same etymology.\n\nSince 1997, Pierre Grison and his organization, \"L'Association de défense des bouchons lyonnais\" (The Association for the Preservation of Lyonnais Bouchons), bestow annual certifications to restaurants as \"authentic\" bouchons. These restaurants receive the title \"Les Authentiques Bouchons Lyonnais\" and are identified with a sticker showing the marionette Gnafron, a Lyonnais symbol of the pleasures of dining, with a glass of wine in one hand and a napkin bearing the Lyon crest in the other.\n\nThe following list, subject to some fluctuation as the certification is bestowed annually, contains most of the certified bouchons: \"Abel\", \"Brunet\", \"Café des deux places\", \"Café des fédérations\", \"Chabert et fils\", \"Daniel et Denise\", \"Chez Georges le petit bouchon\", \"Les gones\", \"Hugon\", \"Le Jura\", \"Chez Marcelle\", \"Le Mercière\", \"La mère Jean\", \"Le mitonné\", \"Le Morgon\", \"Le musée\", \"Chez Paul\", \"Les Trois Maries\", \"A ma vigne\", and \"Le Vivarais\".\n\nWhile many bouchons are now oriented strongly towards the tourist market, with increased prices and less traditional fare as a result, a typical meal in a real bouchon costs around €12-15 .\n\nTypical items in the bouchon repertoire include:\n"}

{"id": "52318297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52318297", "title": "Chamberlain-Kahn Act", "text": "Chamberlain-Kahn Act\n\nThe Chamberlain-Kahn Act of 1918 is a U.S. federal law passed on July 9, 1918 by the 65th United States Congress. The law implemented a public health program that came to be known as the American Plan, whose stated goal was to combat the spread of venereal disease.\n\nThe Chamberlain-Kahn Act gave the government the power to quarantine any woman suspected of having a sexually transmitted disease (STD). A medical examination was required, and if it revealed an STD, this discovery could constitute proof of prostitution. The purpose of this law was to prevent the spread of venereal diseases among U.S. soldiers. During World War I, the American Plan authorized the military to arrest any woman within five miles of a military cantonment. If found infected, a woman could be sentenced to a hospital or a \"farm colony\" until cured. By the end of the war 15,520 prostitutes had been imprisoned, most never having received medical hospitalization.\n\nThe act is named for Senator George Earle Chamberlain of Oregon and Representative Julius Kahn of California.\n\nAmerica entered World War I with an undersized army, resulting in the first compulsory military draft since the American Civil War. The army grew from 128,000 members to four million by the end of the war. Large training camps were built throughout the US in order to train the vast amount of new recruits. These large, isolated camps populated by young men were often associated with excessive alcohol consumption and illicit sexual activities with local women. The culture of military camps coupled with rumors of widespread venereal disease among the militaries of Europe inspired the creation of the Commission on Training Camp Activities, which sought to investigate the sexual and moral cultures of these training camps. The commission report was written by Raymond Fosbick, the assistant to the Secretary of War Newton Baker. In the report, Fosbick urges preventative measures be taken against prostitution and the spread of venereal disease: \n\"\"take all steps necessary to suppress prostitution in the neighborhood of military training camps...We know something of the experience through which our allies have gone. In some cases as much as thirty three and a third percent of the men have been made ineffective through venereal disease. We cannot afford to have any condition of that kind in connection with American troops.\"\nShortly after the report was written, The Commission on Training Activities implemented the Chamberlain-Kahn Act.\n\nThe Chamberlain-Kahn Act of 1918 contains a series of measures intended to stop the spread of venereal disease. Firstly, it created the Interdepartmental Hygiene Board that controlled the allocation of funds for its stated purpose. Secondly, the act authorized the quarantine of citizens suspected of having venereal disease: \n\"That the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy are hereby authorized and directed to adopt measures for the purpose of assisting the various States in caring for civilian persons whose detention, isolation, quarantine, or commitment to institutions may be found necessary for the protection of the military and naval forces of the United States against venereal diseases.\"\" \nThe act allocates $1,000,000 to fund this quarantine effort. Thirdly, the act created Division of Venereal Disease in the Bureau of the Public Health Service. The stated goal of the Division of Venereal Disease was: \"(1) to study and investigate the cause, treatment, and prevention of venereal diseases; (2) to cooperate with State boards or departments of health for the prevention and control of such diseases within the States; and (3) to control and prevent the spread of these diseases in interstate traffic.\"\n\nUnder this law, women suspected to be prostitutes could be stopped, detained, inspected, and could sent to a rehabilitation center if they failed their examination. Any evidence of venereal disease found during one of these exams could constitute proof of prostitution. By 1919, thirty states had constructed facilities for the purpose of detaining and treating women with venereal disease; an estimated 30,000 women were detained and examined during the war. During the course of the war, 110 red light districts throughout America were shut down. Despite these efforts, the availability of prostitutes remained fairly constant around military camps, and rates of venereal disease remained quite high.\n\nIn his 2018 book \"The Trials of Nina McCall\", Scott W. Stern describes the American Plan as a decades-long government-sponsored campaign, under which public health officials were authorized to detain and examine women suspected of carrying a venereal disease and confine those who were positively diagnosed or otherwise judged to be a public health threat to a hospital or jail.\n\n\n"}

The set is a bleak classroom with broken tables and chairs, dirty blackboard and lit with sterile fluorescent lamps. The play starts with six students waiting for a teacher and, like Samuel Beckett’s Vladimir and Estragon, they seem to wait in vain. What the audience learns as the play unravels is that no one cares any more - at least not for these students. The female Deputy Headmistress delivers her scathing assessment, spitting the words with no compassion or understanding, and as soon as she leaves, into the break steps Iron - the school yard bully. He commandeers the situation, forcing each student to ‘teach’ a lesson. \n\nDaniel Day Lewis played the role of Iron in the 1980 production at the Old Vic Theatre, Bristol.\n\nThe play was adapted (\"Klasni Neprijatelj\" in local language) by the East West Theatre Company from Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. but East West Theatre Company's production was adapted by the show's director, Haris Pašović. The original play, set in the South London classroom in early 1980s, was in Pašović's production transported to Sarajevo of 2007. The original cast consisting of six high-school boys was replaced by seven characters – three girls and four boys. The free adaptation, while keeping the original spirit and main themes, was also inspired by the research conducted in Bosnian classrooms.\n\nThe artistic team of the \"Class Enemy\" has conducted a research in some of the secondary schools of Sarajevo and discovered alarming levels of violence among students and teachers. Findings, among other things included information that students often came to school carrying knives, that police was involved frequently, and that rude behavior during classes was a common occurrence. During just a few months, East West Theatre Company's team has recorded a number of cases of brutal violence in Sarajevo and small Bosnian towns which further informed many themes covered by the show.\n\nThe show has won a number of awards including No. 1 Pick of The Year by The Flying Inkpot from Singapore, Best Play Award at Singapore Arts Festival 2008, and Best Contemporary Show Award at International Theatre Festival Kontakt 2009 in Poland. It has also been performed at festivals in Edinburgh (Edinburgh International Festival), Singapore, Shanghai and Sibiu Romania, as well as theatres in Ljubljana Slovenia, Novi Sad Serbia and various small towns across Bosnia.\n\nNigel Williams' shocking 1970s play about a London school has been relocated to modern-day Sarajevo, making the pupils children of the war. This updating, by director Haris Pasovic, is subtle but important. Most obvious change is the switch from a single-sex boys' school to a mixed class of pubescent teenagers, none of whom - either male or female - can go for long without referring to masturbation or making lewd, often violent, approaches to one another. Implicit in the production is also the memory of the collapse of Yugoslavia. One student talks about the poverty he has endured since his father's killing in the war, another about the social malaise that has attracted him to Islamic extremism, and a third about the racial abuse she has suffered as a result of being a Bosnian Serb living within Bosniak ethnic majority.\n\nCast and crew are from across the national spectrum: Serbs, Bosniaks, Croats, all full of disturbing stories of the war. The play's themes of confused social values, isolation, single-parent families, alcoholism, xenophobia and violence were a strong fit, although Pasovic tweaked cultural references somewhat and adjusted dialogue to make it more accessible to a Bosnian audience.\n"}

{"id": "8584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8584", "title": "Dramaturge", "text": "Dramaturge\n\nA dramaturge or dramaturg is a literary adviser or editor in a theatre, opera, or film company who researches, selects, adapts, edits, and interprets scripts, libretti, texts, and printed programmes (or helps others with these tasks), consults with authors, and does public relations work. Its modern-day function was originated by the innovations of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, an 18th-century German playwright, philosopher, and theatre theorist.\n\nOne of the dramaturg(e)'s contributions is to categorise and discuss the various types of plays or operas, their interconnectedness and their styles. The responsibilities of a dramaturg(e) vary from one theatre or opera company to the next. They might include the hiring of actors, the development of a season of plays or operas with a sense of coherence among them, assistance with and editing of new plays or operas by resident or guest playwrights or composers/librettists, the creation of programmes or accompanying educational services, helping the director with rehearsals, and serving as elucidator of history or spokesperson for deceased or otherwise absent playwrights or composers. At larger theatres or opera houses, the dramaturg(e) works on the historical and cultural research into the play or opera and its setting.\n\nIn theatre companies, a dramaturg(e) will create a workbook for the director and actors (usually these are different) and work extensively with the director prior to the first rehearsal.\nGotthold Ephraim Lessing was hired by the Hamburg National Theatre in 1767, to serve as the theaters critic of plays and acting, a position which would later be named dramaturge. This position grew over time to what it is today, encompassing the wide variety of tasks seen by modern dramaturgies. \n\nThe modern definition of Dramaturge is often debated as to what specific tasks this job does, with some defining it as the bridge between the director and the actors, others defining it as one who determines the meaning of plays and shows for the actors, and others claiming that even they don’t quite have a complete definition for their job. Another view of the dramaturge is one who analyzes the texts of shows, and asks This discrepancy between dramaturgies is likely due to the lack of an official historical definition, and the wide variety of tasks that Dramaturgies could be asked to work on, depending on the theater, director, the show being produced, and the actors. Since Gotthold Lessing didn’t create an official definition for his own position at the Hamburg National Theater, modern dramaturgies have to infer their tasks based on what Lessing did during his career, and adapt to the current needs of modern theater. \n\nSince the year 2000, the number of dramaturgies working around the world has increased, albeit it still remains a fairly rare job to have. In 2000, 400 dramaturgies were recorded to be active in the United States, with that number growing. There are various possibilities for what is causing this growth, but some dramaturgies attribute the growth to the fact that dramaturgy combines two popular studies for young students, the Liberal Arts, and Theater. Some dramaturgies are worried, however, that this growth may slow down, due to a decrease in the number of modern plays being written. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "83893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83893", "title": "Escapology", "text": "Escapology\n\nEscapology is the practice of escaping from restraints or other traps. Escapologists (also classified as escape artists) escape from handcuffs, straitjackets, cages, coffins, steel boxes, barrels, bags, burning buildings, fish-tanks, and other perils, often in combination.\n\nThe art of escaping from restraints and confined spaces has been a skill employed by performers for a very long time. It was not originally displayed as an overt act in itself but was instead used secretly to create illusions such as a disappearance or transmutation. In the 1860s, the Davenport Brothers, who were skilled at releasing themselves from rope ties, used the art to convey the impression they were restrained while they created spirit phenomena.\n\nOther illusionists, including John Nevil Maskelyne, worked out how the Davenports did their act and re-created the tricks to debunk the brothers' claims of psychic power. However, the re-creations did not involve overt escape, merely a replication of tricks with the statement that they were accomplished by secret magicians' skills rather than spirits. It took another thirty years before the pure skill of escape began to be displayed as an act in itself. The figure most responsible for making escapology a recognized entertainment was Harry Houdini, who built his career on demonstrating the ability to escape from a huge variety of restraints and difficult situations.\n\nHoudini made no secret of the fact that he was an expert on restraints and the skills needed to overcome them but he often concealed the exact details of his escapes to maintain an air of mystery and suspense. Although many of his escapes relied on technical skills such as lock-picking and contortion, he also performed tricks such as Metamorphosis and the Chinese Water Torture Cell, which are essentially classic stage illusions reliant on cleverly designed props. Houdini's feats helped to define the basic repertoire of escapology, including escapes from handcuffs, padlocks, straitjackets, mail bags, beer barrels, and prison cells.\n\nThe actual term 'escapology' is reputed to have been coined originally by Australian escapologist and illusionist Murray (Norman Murray Walters), a Houdini contemporary.\n\nA succession of performers have added new ideas and created variations on old stunts, but it is common for even the best contemporary escapologists to be dubbed modern day \"Houdinis\".\n\nBecause St. Nicholas Owen successfully escaped the Tower of London and arranged the escape of two Jesuit inmates from the prison, the 16th-century Christian martyr is considered by Catholic escapologists as their patron saint. Along with St. John Don Bosco, the two are considered the primary patrons of Catholic Gospel Magicians.\n\nThe United Kingdom Escape Artists was formed in 2004 and is currently the only organisation in the United Kingdom devoted to the promotion of UK escape artists and the preservation of escapology within the UK. Its members are made up of professional escapologists, restraint collectors, master locksmiths, and historians. The UKEA meet once a year for their AGM.\n\nThe International Escapologists Society is an online society with its own monthly newsletter that is dedicated to the art of escape on an international level.\n\nEscape Masters (The International Association of Escape Artists) was formed in 1985 by renowned escape artist Norman Bigelow and has been run by Thomas Blacke as International President of the organization and Editor/Publisher of the magazine since 2001.\n\nIn 2012, Lucas Wilson, an illusionist from Canada managed the fastest ever recorded escape from a straitjacket while suspended; he escaped in 8.4 seconds while hanging upside down from his ankles at a height of 1m.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9933", "title": "Extreme sport", "text": "Extreme sport\n\nExtreme sports or Adventure sports are recreational activities perceived as involving a high degree of risk. These activities often involve speed, height, a high level of physical exertion, and highly specialized gear.\n\nThe definition of an extreme sport is not exact and the origin of the term is unclear, but it gained popularity in the 1990s when it was picked up by marketing companies to promote the X Games and when the Extreme Sports Channel and the Extreme Sports Company launched. More recently, the commonly used definition from research is \"a competitive (comparison or self-evaluative) activity within which the participant is subjected to natural or unusual physical and mental challenges such as speed, height, depth or natural forces and where fast and accurate cognitive perceptual processing may be required for a successful outcome\" by Dr. Rhonda Cohen (2012).\n\nWhile use of the term \"extreme sport\" has spread everywhere to describe a multitude of different activities, exactly which sports are considered 'extreme' is debatable. There are, however, several characteristics common to most extreme sports. While not the exclusive domain of youth, extreme sports tend to have a younger-than-average target demographic. Extreme sports are rarely sanctioned by schools. Extreme sports tend to be more solitary than traditional sports (rafting and paintballing are notable exceptions, as they are done in teams). In addition, beginning extreme athletes tend to work on their craft without the guidance of a coach (though some may hire a coach later).\n\nActivities categorized by media as extreme sports differ from traditional sports due to the higher number of inherently uncontrollable variables. These environmental variables are frequently weather and terrain related, including wind, snow, water and mountains. Because these natural phenomena cannot be controlled, they inevitably affect the outcome of the given activity or event.\n\nIn a traditional sporting event, athletes compete against each other under controlled circumstances. While it is possible to create a controlled sporting event such as X Games, there are environmental variables that cannot be held constant for all athletes. Examples include changing snow conditions for snowboarders, rock and ice quality for climbers, and wave height and shape for surfers.\n\nWhilst traditional sporting judgment criteria may be adopted when assessing performance (distance, time, score, etc.), extreme sports performers are often evaluated on more subjective and aesthetic criteria. This results in a tendency to reject unified judging methods, with different sports employing their own ideals and indeed having the ability to evolve their assessment standards with new trends or developments in the sports.\n\nWhile the exact definition and what is included as extreme sport is debatable, some attempted to make classification for extreme sports.\n\nOne argument is that to qualify as an \"extreme sport\" both expression terms need to be fulfilled;\n\nAlong this definition, an activity such as bungee jumping may not qualify as no skill or physical ability is required to execute a good jump (i.e., avoid poor execution). A passenger in a canyon jet boat ride will not fulfill the requirements, as the skill required pertains to the pilot, not the passengers. \"Thrill seeking\" might in these cases be a more suitable qualification than \"extreme sport\".\n\nExtreme sports may be subdivided into:\n\nThese sports require the use of snow, ice or water sports (\"sports de glisse\" in French) and rolling sports. Another subdivision can be made along motorized and non motorized vehicle sports, resulting in the following matrix;\n\nNo vehicle is required (rock climbing, canyoning, ice climbing, parkour, psicobloc etc.)\n\nThe origin of the divergence of the term \"extreme sports\" from \"sports\" may date to the 1950s in the appearance of a phrase usually, but wrongly, attributed to Ernest Hemingway. The phrase is;\nThere are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.\nThe implication of the phrase was that the word \"sport\" defined an activity in which one might be killed. The other activities being termed \"games\". The phrase may have been invented by either writer Barnaby Conrad or automotive author Ken Purdy.\n\nThe Dangerous Sports Club of Oxford University, England was founded by David Kirke, Chris Baker, Ed Hulton and Alan Weston. They first came to wide public attention by inventing modern day bungee jumping, by making the first modern jumps on 1 April 1979, from the Clifton Suspension Bridge, Bristol, England. They followed the Clifton Bridge effort with a jump from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California (including the first female bungee jump by Jane Wilmot), and with a televised leap from the Royal Gorge Suspension Bridge in Colorado, sponsored by and televised on the popular American television program \"That's Incredible!\" Bungee jumping was treated as a novelty for a few years, then became a craze for young people, and is now an established industry for thrill seekers.\nThe Club also pioneered a surrealist form of skiing, holding three events at St. Moritz, Switzerland, in which competitors were required to devise a sculpture mounted on skis and ride it down a mountain. The event reached its limits when the Club arrived in St. Moritz with a London double-decker bus, wanting to send it down the ski slopes, and the Swiss resort managers refused.\n\nOther Club activities included expedition hang gliding from active volcanoes; the launching of giant (60 ft) plastic spheres with pilots suspended in the centre (zorbing); microlight flying; and BASE jumping (in the early days of this sport).\n\nIn recent decades the term \"extreme sport\" was further promoted after the Extreme Sports Channel, Extreme.com launched and then the X Games, a multi-sport event was created and developed by ESPN. The first X Games (known as 1995 Extreme Games) were held in Newport, Providence, Mount Snow, and Vermont in the United States.\n\nCertain extreme sports clearly trace back to other extreme sports, or combinations thereof. For example, windsurfing was conceived as a result of efforts to equip a surfboard with a sailing boat's propulsion system (mast and sail). Kitesurfing on the other hand was conceived by combining the propulsion system of kite buggying (a parafoil) with the bi-directional boards used for wakeboarding. Wakeboarding is in turn derived from snowboarding and waterskiing.\n\nSome contend that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one has as much to do with marketing as with the level of danger involved or the adrenaline generated. For example, rugby union is both dangerous and adrenaline-inducing but is not considered an extreme sport due to its traditional image, and because it does not involve high speed or an intention to perform stunts (the aesthetic criteria mentioned above) and also it does not have changing environmental variables for the athletes.\n\nA feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce an adrenaline rush in participants. However, the medical view is that the rush or high associated with the activity is not due to adrenaline being released as a response to fear, but due to increased levels of dopamine, endorphins and serotonin because of the high level of physical exertion. Furthermore, a recent study suggests that the link to adrenaline and 'true' extreme sports is tentative. The study defined 'true' extreme sports as a leisure or recreation activity where the most likely outcome of a mismanaged accident or mistake was death. This definition was designed to separate the marketing hype from the activity.\n\nEric Brymer also found that the potential of various extraordinary human experiences, many of which parallel those found in activities such as meditation, was an important part of the extreme sport experience. Those experiences put the participants outside their comfort zone and are often done in conjunction with adventure travel.\n\nSome of the sports have existed for decades and their proponents span generations, some going on to become well known personalities. Rock climbing and ice climbing have spawned publicly recognizable names such as Edmund Hillary, Chris Bonington, Wolfgang Güllich and more recently Joe Simpson. Another example is surfing, invented centuries ago by the inhabitants of Hawaii.\n\nExtreme sports by their nature can be extremely dangerous, conducive to fatalities, near-fatalities and other serious injuries, and sometimes consist in treading along the brink of death. This imminent and inherent danger in these sports has been considered a somewhat necessary part of its appeal, which is partially a result of pressure for athletes to make more money and provide maximum entertainment.\n\nDisabled people participate in extreme sports. Nonprofit organizations such as Adaptive Action Sports seek to increase awareness of the participation in action sports by members of the disabled community, as well as increase access to the adaptive technologies that make participation possible and to competitions such as The X Games.\n\nExtreme sports is a sub-category of sports than are described as any kind of sport \"of a character or kind farthest removed from the ordinary or average\". These kinds of sports often carry out the potential risk of serious and permanent physical injury and even death. However, these sports also have the potential to produce drastic benefits on mental and physical health.\n\nHealth is an individual's state of mental and physical well-being in which they are maximising their daily potential. It is divided into two main categories: mental and physical.\n\nMental health is a cognitive state of well-being, in this state the individual is aware of his or how own potential and is able to; cope with stresses of normal life and work productively, as well as willing to give their contribution to his or her community in a beneficial way.\n\nPhysical health can be defined as a state of complete physical well-being in which an individual is mechanically fit to perform their daily activities and duties without any problem.\n\nExtreme sports trigger the release of the hormone adrenaline. This is a very powerful hormone as it can cause human beings to perform tremendous stunts of many sorts. However, with a bad mix of other hormones it can lead people to execute terrible actions. It is believed that the implementation of extreme sports on mental health patients improves their perspective and recognition of aspects of life.\n\n"}

The original award was the result of a friendly competition of National Weather Service offices in Upstate. It was originally conceived after the Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977. After the Rochester and Syracuse offices closed in the mid-1990s, the competition died out.\n\nThe award was revived during the 2002–2003 snowfall season, in which Syracuse won. It had won every year from then through the 2010–2011 season as well. In the 2011–2012 season, Rochester was the first city other than Syracuse to win since the award's revival.

He started acting at age eight, when his father, a scenic artist had him perform on stage. In the 1890s he was a cartoonist for the British comics magazine \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\". He performed as bass-baritone singer in the minstrel show \"White Coons\". In 1905 Hemsley started acting in the music hall stage show \"The Follies\" with his familiar act of impersonating children's voices. He did this by covering his mouth with a book, newspaper or just his hand to signal a transition. His imitations were so spot-on that later, when he went on radio, many listeners were fooled. He also did celebrity voice impressions, among them of actor Wilson Barrett.\n\nIn December 1934 Hemsley presented the weekly radio show \"Ovaltiney's Concert Party\" on Radio Luxembourg, a show which ran until the outbreak of World War II in September 1939.\nThe show featured Hemsley in a series of sketches where he impersonated \"his\" four children Johnny, Elsie, Winnie and baby Horace, in varying falsetto voices in comic dialogues with Hemsley as \"daddy\". The fourth child, the baby Horace, was perpetually unintelligible, and had to be interpreted by his elder sister Winnie. This led to Hemsley's familiar catchphrase:\n\"What did Horace say, ...?\" The fictional family featured on Ovaltiney's Concert Party on Radio Luxembourg from 1934 to 1939.\n\nThe show was so popular at the time that it spawned a comic magazine, in which comics based on the radio characters were drawn by Harry Hemsley and S. K. Perkins.\n\nAfter World War II Hemsley made other radio shows like \"Old Hearty\" (1947) and \"Hemsley's Hotel\" (1949).

The program attracted more than 6,000 people on a single evening.\n\nIn 2007, the Park became the venue for a series of activities called Kids' Day. Although the main target was children, it drew families as well because of the \"family\" factor - the games involved adults such as moms and dads as well. The GIGGLES also began appearing regularly during activities at the Mall and around the country at shopping centers. By the end of 2007, the Giggles had made appearances in schools, public events, and party functions.\n\nIn late 2008, JPCC launched its Family Concert Nights (later renamed \"Local is Best - Family Entertainment Night\") featuring local talent. The program's goals are to entice local artists to perform and create an audience for their music. The shows are reviewed and approved by a Censorship Board.\n\nOn December 12, 2009, JPCC Management introduced a new ticket system. Entrance to the Playground was made free, and guests who wanted to use the attractions had the option to buy an $8 \"4 plus 1 ride\" ticket, and a $10 \"5 plus 3 ride\" ticket.\n\nBy the end of 2010, attendance to the park was up to 144,000 people annually. This figures are based on the actual park admittance and ticket sales.\n\nThe park underwent an extensive remodel in 2011. The park was reopened on March 19, 2011 with new attractions including bumper cars and boats, trains, and scooters. That month also saw a record high of over 70,000 visitors.\n"}

Although most chess problems, like other creative forms, are appreciated for serious artistic themes (Grimshaw, Novotny, and Lacny), joke chess problems are enjoyed for some twist. In some cases the composer plays a trick to prevent a solver from succeeding with typical analysis. In other cases, the humor derives from an unusual final position. Unlike in ordinary chess puzzles, joke problems can involve a solution which violates the inner logic or rules of the game.\n\nSome chess puzzles are not really puzzles at all. In the diagram, White is asked to checkmate Black in six moves. The joke in this case is that, by the rules of chess, White has no choice in the matter: the only legal moves available lead directly to the \"solution\":\n\nTim Krabbé provides other examples on his chess website.\n\nThe rules of chess are fairly simple and clearly defined. Nevertheless, some composers have relied on ambiguities in the rules to create humorous puzzles. A typical example would be the position shown in the diagram on the right. According to chess legend, a composer stipulated \"White mates in one move.\" It appears to be impossible, and now is, but formerly the color of the promoted piece was not specified, and the \"solution\" was for White to promote to a \"black\" knight on b8, thus depriving the black king of its only escape square.\nA more sophisticated example was composed by Tim Krabbé and relied on a loophole that existed in the definition of castling. In the diagram, White must mate in three moves. The solution begins 1. e7, then the main variations are:\n\nIn the last variation, White castles with his newly promoted rook, moving his king to e3 and the rook to e2. Under the rules of chess at the time, this move was arguably legal because the rook had not moved yet. Afterward, FIDE amended the rules to require that the castling rook must occupy the same \"rank\" as the king.\n\nSome problems are notable for extremely unusual patterns of piece placement. For example, direct mates and especially helpmates have been composed with the pieces in the shape of a letter or number, or even a tree.\n\nA more interesting example occurs in this 1st Prize winner by Kirtley, where the final position echoes a familiar pattern. Krabbé calls this problem the \"back home task\", as all eight white pieces retreat to their initial positions. He writes that \"Strategy and deep themes are absent, Black only has forced moves, but it's one of the funniest chess problems I ever saw.\" White must selfmate in eight moves; i.e., he must force Black to checkmate White against Black's will. The solution is:\n\nKrabbé named the \"caterpillar theme\" for problems and studies where doubled or tripled pawns move one after the other. The diagram at the right shows a particularly silly example, with White forcing mate in six moves. The solution is:\n\nKrabbé wrote a whole article on the caterpillar theme, citing about ten examples.\nThe American composer William A. Shinkman (1847–1933) is famous for composing the problem in the diagram, with sextupled pawns on the a-file. As Krabbé writes on his website, \"The solution, as it should be in a joke, is not difficult: 1. 0-0-0 Kxa7 2. Rd8 Kxa6 3. Rd7 Kxa5 4. Rd6 Kxa4 5. Rd5 Kxa3 6. Rd4 Kxa2 7. Rd3 Ka1 8. Ra3#\". \n\nThe problem is \"\" (ruined, in the lingo of chess composition), however, because 1.Kd2 also forces mate in eight moves. But this problem was not intended to be a sound mate in eight, and was instead intended to be a proof game in 34 moves with seven consecutive captures by Black.\nHumour is a component of some traditional themes, such as grotesque and Excelsior.\n\nIn 2004, Hans Böhm sponsored a chess composing tournament for humorous endgame studies. The top two entries appear with solutions on Krabbé's website.\n\nIn this kind of problem, although the problem is posed as a standard chess problem, the solution has nothing to do with chess moves. An example is this problem composed by British composer Thomas Rayner Dawson. In the position in the diagram, Black had decided to resign (although it wasn't his turn). White advised his opponent not to give up so quickly. \"But I am bound to lose, and there is nothing I—or you, for that matter—can do\", said Black. But White insisted: \"I'll bet you $100 that I can lose this game!\" So the two made the bet and White actually lost. He did not resign, lose on time, or anything like that. How did he lose? The solution is in the words: White did not lose the game (which is impossible in the diagram position, as the only legal moves are 1.g7+ Qxg7+ 2.hxg7#), but rather the bet.\n\n"}

{"id": "1154786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1154786", "title": "Koodiyattam", "text": "Koodiyattam\n\nKoodiyattam (), also transliterated as Kutiyattam, is a traditional performing artform in the state of Kerala, India. It is a combination of ancient Sanskrit theatre with elements of Koothu, a Tamil/Malayalam performing art which is as old as Sangam era. It is officially recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\nKoothu (കൂത്തു് கூத்து) means dance or performance in Malayalam and Tamil. \nKoodiyattam (kutiyattam), meaning \"combined acting\" as it combines dramas in Sanskrit theatre with elements of traditional Koothu. It is traditionally performed in temple theatres known as \"Koothambalams\" of Kerala. It is the only surviving artform that uses dramas from ancient Sanskrit theatre. It has an attested history of a thousand years in Kerala, but its origin and evolution are shrouded in mystery. Koodiyattam and chakyar koothu were among the dramatized dance worship services in temples of ancient India, particularly Kerala. Both koodiyattam and chakyar koothu originates from ancient south Indian artform Koothu which is mentioned several times in ancient sangam literature of south and also in the epigraphs belonging to subsequent Pallava, Chera, Chola periods. Inscriptions related to the dramatized dance worship services known as Koothu are available in temples at Tanjore, Tiruvidaimaruthur, Vedaranyam, Tiruvarur, and Omampuliyur. They were treated as an integral part of worship services alongside the singing of tevaram and prabandam hymns. There are mentions in epigraphs those forms of Koothu that are called \"aariyam\" when they use languages other than Tamil such as Sanskrit, Pali or Prakrit for plays.\n\nSeveral ancient kings and members of other professions are listed to have authored several works for these services. There is evidence of these services being done all over ancient subcontinent during time of cholas and pallavas. A Pallava king called Rajasimha has been credited with authoring a play called \"kailasodharanam\" in Tamil that has the topic of Ravana becoming subject to Siva's anger and being subdued mercilessly for the same. For examples a fragmented inscription at the door step of an ancient Shiva temple (now non-existent) in Pegan in Burma finds mention of these services.\n\nIt is believed that Kulasekhara Varman Cheraman Perumal, an ancient king of Chera dynasty, who ruled from Mahodayapuram (modern Kodungallur), reformed Koodiyattam, introducing the local language for Vidusaka and structuring presentation of the play to well-defined units. He himself wrote two plays, \"Subhadraharana\" and \"Tapatisamvarana\" and made arrangements for their presentation on stage with the help of a Brahmin friend called Tolan. These plays are still presented on stage. Apart from these, the plays traditionally presented include Ascaryacudamani of Saktibhadra, Kalyanasaugandhika of Nilakantha, Bhagavadajjuka of Bodhayana, \"Nagananda of Harsa\", and many plays ascribed to Bhasa including Abhiseka and Pratima. The Kutiyattam performance was performed in specially designed temples called koothambalams.\n\nThe use of Buddhist themes for plays is a very controversial and moot issue and seem to be a later interpolation not existing since ancient times for the latter not being a then-legal vedic system.\n\nTraditionally, the main musical instruments used in Koodiyattam are mizhavu, kuzhitalam, edakka, kurumkuzhal, and sankhu. Mizhavu, the most prominent of these, is a percussion instrument that is played by a person of the Ambalavas Nambiar caste, accompanied by Nangyaramma playing the kuzhithalam (a type of cymbal).\n\nTraditionally, Koodiyattam has been performed by Chakyars (a subcaste of Kerala Hindus) and by Nangyaramma (women of the Ambalavasi Nambiar caste). The name Koodiyattam, meaning playing or performing together, is thought to refer to the presence or more actors on stage who act in consonance with the beats of the mizhavu drummers. Alternatively, it may also be a reference to a common practice in Sanskrit drama where a single actor who has performed solo for several nights is joined by another.\n\nThe main actor is a Chakyar who performs the ritualistic Koothu and Koodiyattam inside the temple or in the Koothambalam. Chakyar women, Illotammas, are not allowed to participate. Instead, the female roles are played by Nangyaramma. Koodiyattam performances are lengthy and elaborate affairs, ranging from 12 to 150 hours spread across several nights. A complete Koodiyattam performance consists of three parts. The first of these is the \"purappadu\" where an actor performs a verse along with the nritta aspect of dance. Following this is the \"nirvahanam\" where the actor, using abhinaya, brings to the audience the mood of the main character of the play. The \"nirvahanam\", a retrospective, takes the audience up to the point where the actual play begins. The final part of the performance is \"koodiyattam\" which is the play itself. While the first two parts are solo acts, Koodiyattam can have as many characters as are required to perform on the stage.\n\nThe practice was that elders of the Chakyar community taught it to their youngsters and it was an art form performed only by Chakyars until the 1950s. In 1955 Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar performed Kutiyattam outside the temple for the first time. For performing the art forms outside the temples he faced many problems from the hardline Chakyar community. In his own words:\n\nIn 1962, under the leadership of Dr. V. Raghavan, noted art and Sanskrit scholar, Sanskrit Ranga of Madras, invited Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar to perform Kutiyattam in Chennai. Thus for the first time in history Kutiyattam was performed outside Kerala. They presented at Madras on three nights: Kutiyattam scenes from three plays \"Abhiṣeka\",\"Subhadrādhanañjaya\" and \"Nāgānda\".\n\nIn early 1960s Maria Christoffer Byrski, a Polish student doing research in Indian theatres at Banaras Hindu University came to study Kootiyattam with Mani Madhava Chakyar and became the first non-Chakyar/nambiar to learn the art form. He stayed in Guru's home at Killikkurussimangalam and studied the art form in traditional Gurukula way.\n\n\nKoodiyattam has traditionally been an exclusive art form performed in special venues called \"koothambalams\" in Hindu temples and access to these performances were highly restricted to only caste Hindus. Also, performances are lengthy taking up to forty \ndays to complete. The collapse of the feudal order in the nineteenth century in Kerala led to a curtailment in the patronage extended to Koodiyattam artistes and they faced serious financial difficulties. Following a revival in the early twentieth century, Koodiyattam is once again facing a lack of funding, leading to a severe crisis in the profession. UNESCO has called for the creation of a network of Koodiyattam institutions and gurukalams to nurture the transmission of the art form to future generations and for the development of new audiences besides fostering greater academic research in it. The Margi Theatre Group in Thiruvananthapuram is a notable organisation dedicated to the revival of Kathakali and Koodiyattom in Kerala. Also Nepathya is an exclusive institution to promote Koodiyattam and related art forms working at Moozhikkulam. The Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama, awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the highest award for performing artists, to Kutiyattam artists like, Kalamandalam Sivan Namboodiri (2007), Painkulam Raman Chakyar (2010) and Painkulam Damodara Chakyar (2012).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Modern companies exist around the world and at a range of skill levels. Most groups make little or no money, while a few, well-established groups are profitable.\n\nAlthough improvisational theater has existed in some form or another since the 16th century, modern improv began with the teachings of Viola Spolin in Chicago, Illinois, USA and Keith Johnstone during the 1940-50s in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Spolin's teachings led to the creation of The Compass Players, the first modern improvisational theater company, in 1955. The presence of The Compass Players, The Second City, and ImprovOlympic in Chicago created a strength in the form within the city that continues to this day. New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Toronto are other major hubs of improvisational theater in the North America.\n\nMany companies host improvisational theatre festivals or give improvisational theatre classes. Professional groups often perform a regular stage show acted by the most senior members. Along with this, they host \"house\" improv teams made up of improv students or graduates from their classes. In the past decade, professional improvisational theater groups have gradually started working more with corporate clients, using improvisational games to improve productivity and communication in the workplace.\n\nMajor Professional companies have branches in more than one city, have touring groups, and/or host large-scale improvisational comedy schools.

The basic Minimate figure design has a 2\" tall body that resembles an extremely simplified human form with 14 points of articulation, higher than average for block figures. Released in both specialty stores as well as mass-market retailers, Minimates are made for both kid-friendly and adult-oriented properties, giving them a diverse fan base. The best-known and longest-running series of Minimates is based on Marvel Comics, with over 60 waves of figures in existence, but lines of Minimates have been released for numerous other comic books, TV series, movies and video games.\n\nDesigned and produced by New York City-based sculpting and design house Art Asylum, the Minimates began in 2002 with multiple lines of 3\" Minimates based on several different licenses. These included \"Dark Angel\", \"Star Trek\", \"Kung Faux\", \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", and the films of \"Bruce Lee\", along with a Rock line featuring KISS, Rob Zombie, Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper. The 3\" Minimate Line also included several blank or promotional Minimates—these usually bore the logo of a specific company and were used as giveaways.\n\nMinimates came of age in 2003 when, following a partnership with Diamond Select Toys, a range of 2\" Minimates based upon the Marvel Comics Universe was launched. The 2\" Minimate body type began to be used for the promotional Minimates in place of the 3\" body type, and it was announced that the 3\" range would be discontinued. However, a Lord of the Rings line produced by Art Asylum and Play Along Toys in 2004 added a third body type, which stood 2.5\" tall, to further illustrate the size differences of the various races of Middle-Earth.\n\nIn 2004, Art Asylum and Play Along launched their Minimate-based C3 (\"Create Construct Customize\") construction sets, which could be used to build vehicles and playsets from the DC Comics universe. Focusing mainly on Batman and the Justice League, the Lego-esque line was moderately successful, but the license terms limited the selling of the 2\" DC Minimates to the construction sets, and the line failed to gain a foothold in the market. C3 was discontinued, and in 2006 DC Direct announced that they had picked up the DC Minimates line and would put out their own figures (in 2\" and 2.5\" scales) in partnership with Art Asylum. That same year, non-construction-set vehicles were introduced to the brand, in lines based on the \"Speed Racer\" cartoon (from Art Asylum) as well as both the classic and modern \"Battlestar Galactica\" TV series (from Art Asylum and Diamond Select Toys).\n\nIn 2007, Art Asylum became a division of Diamond Select Toys, and the Minimates body type has since been applied to dozens of licenses from comic books (\"The Walking Dead\"\", Invincible\"), TV (\"24\", Star Trek again), movies (\",\" Universal Monsters, Marvel Studios), animation (\"The Real Ghostbusters\", Peter Pan\") and video games (Halo,\" Tomb Raider\", \"Marvel vs. Capcom 3\"). DST has also developed Minimates based on its own concepts, under the brands Calico Jack's Pirate Raiders, Minimates M.A.X., and Battle Beasts, which they acquired the trademark for in 2009.\n\nToday, most Minimates lines are sold as two-packs, assortments of which are often shared between Toys \"R\" Us and the specialty comic market, which includes comic book shops and specialty toy stores serviced by Diamond Comic Distributors. Four-packs are also offered at Toys \"R\" Us and specialty, as well as through retailers like the Disney Store and Action Figure Xpress. Both two-packs and four-packs have been offered at major pop culture conventions, including San Diego's Comic-Con International, New York Comic Con and C2E2.\n\nDue to license restrictions limiting all Marvel Minimates to the 2\" scale, a range of four 8\" unarticulated resin statues under the \"Minimates Max\" banner were announced for 2006, to represent larger-scale characters in the Minimate style. Unfortunately, because of the cost and unarticulated nature of the statues, the line was not well received and eventually cancelled, with only two of the four announced statues released, Galactus and the Sentinel. (Wolverine and Spider-Man were unproduced.)\n\nThe Minimates Vehicles line featured original ships and jets from DST's Pirate Raiders and M.A.X brands alongside licensed vehicles from \"\", Back to the Future and \"Knight Rider\", each in their own individually branded packaging. Each assortment featured color variations between Toys R Us and specialty, to differentiate between the two releases. While no longer offered in assortments, DST has continued to release vehicles individually, including Halo's Warthog vehicles, the Munsters' Koach, Captain Hook's pirate ship from \"Peter Pan\", different versions of the Delorean from the Back to the Future trilogy, and several versions of the U.S.S. \"Enterprise\" from \".\"\n\nDiamond Select Toys has also produced a carrying case that holds up to 36 Minimates, and comes with an exclusive figure. The first edition came with a Battle Beast, the second edition with a Pirate Raider, and the third, scheduled for 2013, will come with a silver 10th Anniversary Minimate.\n\nIn 2005, animation students at the DAVE School produced \"\", featuring computer-generated Minimate characters, as a class project. \"New Times\" features Batman, Catwoman and the Joker, and is notable for its all-star cast, including Adam West and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as the Batman and the Joker. Never intended for commercial release, \"New Times\" was released as a download on the DAVE School website and was available as a free DVD from DAVE School itself. As a promotional item, the Batman minimate from the Mini-Batmobile set was released separately in a \"Batman: New Time\" bag.\n\nIn 2006, an animated X-Men movie in the same style as \"Batman: New Times\" was produced under the name \"X-Men: Darktide\". Released on DVD as part of a box set containing Minimates of Magneto, New X-Men Cyclops, New X-Men Wolverine and Juggernaut, the movie features those characters, as well as the debuts of Minimate versions of \"New X-Men\" Storm, Beast and Archangel.\n\nCurrently, Diamond Select Toys is producing stop-motion animation for its in-house brands – Calico Jack's Pirate Raiders, Minimates M.A.X. and Battle Beasts – using actual Minimates, and posting it for free online. A minimally animated commercial using their line of Walking Dead Minimates has also been released online.\n\n"}
{"id": "18932641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18932641", "title": "Motion Picture Association of America", "text": "Motion Picture Association of America\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) is an American trade association representing the six major film studios of Hollywood. Founded in 1922 as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA), its original goal was to ensure the viability of the American film industry. In addition, the MPAA established guidelines for film content which resulted in the creation of the Production Code in 1930. This code, also known as the Hays Code, was replaced by a voluntary film rating system in 1968, which is managed by the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA).\n\nMore recently, the MPAA has advocated for the motion picture and television industry, with the goals of promoting effective copyright protection, reducing piracy, and expanding market access. It has long worked to curb copyright infringement, including recent attempts to limit the sharing of copyrighted works via peer-to-peer file-sharing networks and by streaming from pirate sites. Former United States Ambassador to France Charles Rivkin is the current chairman and CEO of the MPAA.\n\nThe MPAA was founded as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) in 1922 as a trade association of member motion picture companies. At its founding, MPPDA member companies produced approximately 70 to 80 percent of the films made in the United States. Former Postmaster General Will H. Hays was named the association's first president.\n\nThe main focus of the MPPDA in its early years was on producing a strong public relations campaign to ensure that Hollywood remained financially stable and able to attract investment from Wall Street, while simultaneously ensuring that American films had a \"clean moral tone\". The MPPDA also instituted a code of conduct for Hollywood's actors in an attempt to govern their behavior offscreen. Finally, the code sought to protect American film interests abroad by encouraging film studios to avoid racist portrayals of foreigners.\n\nFrom the early days of the association, Hays spoke out against public censorship, and the MPPDA worked to raise support from the general public for the film industry's efforts against such censorship. Large portions of the public opposed censorship, but also decried the lack of morals in movies.\n\nAt the time of the MPPDA's founding, there was no national censorship, but some state and municipal laws required movies to be censored, a process usually oveseen by a local censorship board. Thus, in certain locations in the U.S., films were often edited to comply with local laws regarding the onscreen portrayal of violence and sexuality, among other topics. This resulted in negative publicity for the studios and decreasing numbers of theater goers, who were uninterested in films that were sometimes so severely edited that they were incoherent. In 1929, more than 50 percent of American moviegoers lived in a location overseen by such a board.\n\nIn 1924, Hays instituted \"The Formula\", a loose set of guidelines for filmmakers, in an effort to get the movie industry to self-regulate the issues that the censorship boards had been created to address. \"The Formula\" requested that studios send synopses of films being considered to the MPPDA for review. This effort largely failed, however, as studios were under no obligation to send their scripts to Hays's office, nor to follow his recommendations.\n\nIn 1927, Hays oversaw the creation of a code of \"Don'ts and Be Carefuls\" for the industry. This list outlined the issues that movies could encounter in different localities. Hays also created a Studio Relations Department (SRD) with staff available to the studios for script reviews and advice regarding potential problems. Again, despite Hays' efforts, studios largely ignored the \"Don'ts and Be Carefuls,\" and by the end of 1929, the MPPDA received only about 20 percent of Hollywood scripts prior to production, and the number of regional and local censorship boards continued to increase.\n\nIn 1930, the MPPDA introduced the Production Code, sometimes called the \"Hays Code\". The Code consisted of moral guidelines regarding what was acceptable to include in films. Unlike the \"Dont's and Be Carefuls\", which the studios had ignored, the Production Code was endorsed by studio executives. The Code incorporated many of the \"Don'ts and Be Carefuls\" as specific examples of what could not be portrayed. Among other rules, the code prohibited inclusion of \"scenes of passion\" unless they were essential to a film's plot; \"pointed profanity\" in either word or action; \"sex perversion\"; justification or explicit coverage of adultery; sympathetic treatment of crime or criminals; dancing with \"indecent\" moves; and white slavery. Because studio executives had been involved in the decision to adopt the code, MPPDA-member studios were more willing to submit scripts for consideration. However, the growing economic impacts of the Great Depression of the early 1930s increased pressure on studios to make films that would draw the largest possible audiences, even if it meant taking their chances with local censorship boards by disobeying the Code.\n\nIn 1933 and 1934 the Catholic Legion of Decency, along with a number of Protestant and women's groups, launched plans to boycott films that they deemed immoral. In order to avert boycotts which might further harm the profitability of the film industry, the MPPDA created a new department, the Production Code Administration (PCA), with Joseph Breen as its head. Unlike previous attempts at self-censorship, PCA decisions were binding—no film could be exhibited in an American theater without a stamp of approval from the PCA, and any producer attempting to do so faced a fine of $25,000. After ten years of unsuccessful voluntary codes and expanding local censorship boards, the studio approved and agreed to enforce the codes, and the nationwide \"Production Code\" was enforced starting on July 1, 1934.\n\nIn the years that immediately followed the adoption of the Code, Breen often sent films back to Hollywood for additional edits, and in some cases, simply refused to issue PCA approval for a film to be shown. At the same time, Hays promoted the industry's new focus on wholesome films and continued promoting American films abroad.\n\nFor nearly three years, studios complied with the Code. By 1938, however, as the threat of war in Europe loomed, movie producers began to worry about the possibility of decreased profits abroad. This led to a decreased investment in following the strictures of the code, and occasional refusals to comply with PCA demands. That same year, responding to trends in European films in the run-up to the war, Hays spoke out against using movies as a vehicle for propaganda. In 1945, after 24 years as president, Hays stepped down from his position at the MPPDA, although he continued to act as an advisor for the Association for the next five years.\n\nIn 1945 the MPPDA hired Eric Johnston, four-time president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, to replace Hays. During his first year as president, Johnston rebranded the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).\n\nHe also created the Motion Picture Export Association (MPEA) to promote American films abroad by opposing production company monopolies in other countries. In 1947 the MPEA voted to discontinue film shipments to Britain after the British government imposed an import tax on American films. Johnston negotiated with the British government to end the tax in 1948, and film shipments resumed.\n\nIn 1956, Johnston oversaw the first major revision of the Production Code since it was created in 1930. This revision allowed the treatment of some subjects which had previously been forbidden, including abortion and the use of narcotics, so long as they were \"within the limits of good taste\". At the same time, the revisions added a number of new restrictions to the code, including outlawing the depiction of blasphemy and mercy killings in films.\n\nJohnston was well-liked by studio executives, and his political connections helped him function as an effective liaison between Hollywood and Washington. In 1963, while still serving as president of the MPAA, Johnston died of a stroke. For three years, the MPAA operated without a president while studio executives searched for a replacement.\n\nThe MPAA hired Jack Valenti, former aide to President Lyndon Johnson, as president of the MPAA in 1966. In 1968, Valenti replaced the Production Code with a system of voluntary film ratings, in order to limit censorship of Hollywood films and provide parents with information about the appropriateness of films for children. In addition to concerns about protecting children, Valenti stated in his autobiography that he sought to ensure that American filmmakers could produce the films they wanted, without the censorship that existed under the Production Code that had been in effect since 1934.\n\nIn 1975 Valenti established the Film Security Office, an anti-piracy division at the MPAA, which sought to recover unauthorized recordings of films to prevent duplication. Valenti continued to fight piracy into the 1980s, asking Congress to install chips in VCRs that would prevent illegal reproduction of video cassettes, and in the 1990s supported law enforcement efforts to stop bootleg distribution of video tapes. Valenti also oversaw a major change in the ratings system that he had helped create—the removal of the \"X\" rating, which had come to be closely associated with pornography. It was replaced with a new rating, \"NC-17\", in 1990.\n\nIn 2001 Valenti established the Digital Strategy Department at the MPAA to specifically address issues surrounding digital film distribution and piracy.\n\nAfter serving as president of the MPAA for 38 years, Valenti announced that he would step down in 2004. In September of that year, he was replaced by former Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman. During his tenure, Glickman focused on tax issues, content protection efforts, and increasing U.S. studios' access to international markets. He led lobbying efforts that resulted in $400 million in federal tax incentives for the movie industry, and also supported a law which created federal oversight of anti-piracy efforts. Glickman stepped down in 2010.\n\nAfter a search which lasted over a year, the MPAA hired former U.S. Senator Chris Dodd to replace Glickman in March 2011. In his role as president, Dodd focused on content protection, trade, and improving Hollywood's image. He traveled to China in 2011 in an effort to encourage the Chinese government to both crack down on piracy and further open its film market. A settlement of a long-argued World Trade Organization complaint, coupled with Dodd's efforts, contributed to the United States' agreement with China in 2012 to open China's film market to more Hollywood films and to increase U.S. studios' share of box office revenues in China. In addition to this agreement with China, the U.S. signed more than 20 memos of understanding with foreign governments regarding the enforcement of intellectual property rights during Dodd's tenure at the MPAA.\n\nIn 2011, the MPAA supported the passage of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). After the two bills were shelved in early 2012, Dodd indicated that Hollywood might cut off campaign contributions to politicians who failed to support anti-piracy efforts in the future.\n\nIn 2012, the MPAA launched the Diversity and Multicultural Outreach program, as part of an effort to increase diversity in the television and film industry both through employment and representation on screen. Since its inception, the Diversity and Multicultural and Outreach group has conducted outreach and partnered with more than 20 multicultural groups and national civil rights organizations in sponsoring film screenings, festivals, and other diversity-themed events.\n\nThroughout his tenure at the MPAA, Dodd also highlighted the need for movie studios to embrace technology as a means of distributing content.\n\nIn June 2017, the MPAA supported the launch of the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), a coalition of entertainment companies, including the six major studios, Netflix and Amazon, that will draw on the MPAA's resources in an effort to reduce online piracy through research and legal efforts.\n\nAs announced on April 28, 2017, former U.S. Ambassador to France and Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs Charles Rivkin succeeded Chris Dodd as CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, effective September 5, 2017, and as chairman, effective December 6, 2017.\n\nIn 1968, the MPAA established the Code and Rating Administration, or CARA (later renamed the Classification and Rating Administration), which began issuing ratings for films exhibited and distributed commercially in the United States to help parents determine what films are appropriate for their children.\n\nSince the rating system was first introduced in November 1968, it has gone through several changes, including the addition of a PG-13 rating. The ratings system is completely voluntary, and ratings have no legal standing. Instead, theater owners enforce the MPAA film ratings after they have been assigned, with many theaters refusing to exhibit non-rated films. An unrated film is often denoted by \"NR\", such as in newspapers, although this is not a formal MPAA rating.\n\nIn 2006 the film \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\" alleged that the MPAA gave preferential treatment to member studios during the process of assigning ratings, as well as criticizing the rating process for its lack of transparency. In response, the MPAA posted its ratings rules, policies, and procedures, as well as its appeals process, online.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study commissioned by CARA, ninety-three percent of parents in the U.S. find the rating system to be a helpful tool.\n\nThe ratings currently used by the MPAA's voluntary system are:\n\nThe original members of the MPAA were the \"Big Eight\" film studios, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Loews, Universal Studios, Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, United Artists, and RKO Pictures. Two years later, Loews merged with Metro Pictures, Goldwyn Pictures, and Louis B. Mayer Productions to form Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nUnited Artists briefly resigned from the organization in 1956 over a ratings dispute, although they rejoined later in the decade. By 1966, Allied Artists Pictures had joined the original members. In the following decade, new members joining the MPAA included Avco Embassy in 1975 and Walt Disney Studios in 1979. The next year, Filmways became a MPAA member, but was later replaced in 1986 along with Avco Embassy when the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and Orion Pictures joined the MPAA roster.\n\nIn 1995 the MPAA members were: the Walt Disney Studios; Paramount Pictures; Universal Studios; Warner Bros; 20th Century Fox; MGM—which included United Artists after their 1981 merger—and Sony Pictures, which included Columbia and TriStar Pictures after their acquisition in 1989. Turner Entertainment joined the MPAA in 1995, but was purchased in 1996 by Time Warner.\n\nAs of 2017 the MPAA member companies are: Walt Disney Studios; Paramount Pictures Corporation; Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.; Twentieth Century Fox; Universal Studios LLC; and Warner Bros Entertainment Inc.\n\nThe MPAA's concerted efforts at fighting copyright infringement began in 1975 with the establishment of the Film Security Office, which sought to recover unauthorized recordings of films in order to prevent duplication. The MPAA has continued to pursue a number of initiatives to combat illegal distribution of films and TV shows, especially in response to new technologies. In the 1980s, it spoke out against VCRs and the threat that the MPAA believed they represented to the movie industry, with MPAA president Jack Valenti drawing a parallel between the threat of the VCR and that of the Boston Strangler. In 1986, the MPAA asked Congress to pass a law that would require VCRs to come equipped with a chip to prevent them from making copies. Legal efforts at stopping homemade copies of broadcast television largely ended, however, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that such copying constituted fair use.\n\nThe MPAA continued to support law enforcement efforts to stop bootleg production and distribution of videos tapes and laserdiscs into the 1990s, and in 2000 took successful legal action against individuals posting DVD decryption software on the Internet in Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes. Following the release of RealDVD—an application that enabled users to make copies of DVDs—RealNetworks sued the DVD Copy Control Association and the major studios in 2008 over the legality of the software, accusing them of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. The judgment found there were no grounds for the antitrust claim and dismissed the suit. The court later found that the RealNetworks product violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\n\nThe MPAA has continued to support law enforcement efforts to prevent illegal distribution of copyrighted materials online. The MPAA and its British counterpart, the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT), also funded the training of Lucky and Flo, a pair of Labrador Retrievers, to detect polycarbonates used in the manufacturing of DVDs.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the MPAA began focusing its efforts to curb copyright infringement specifically on peer-to-peer file sharing, initially using a combination of educational campaigns and cease and desist letters to discourage such activity. In the first six months of 2002, the MPAA sent more than 18,000 such letters to internet service providers to forward to users engaged in copyright infringement.\n\nIn late 2004, the MPAA changed course and filed lawsuits in a concerted effort to address copyright infringement on a number of large online file-sharing services, including BitTorrent and eDonkey. The following year, the MPAA expanded its legal actions to include lawsuits against individuals who downloaded and distributed copyrighted material via peer-to-peer networks.\n\nThe MPAA also played a role in encouraging the Swedish government to conduct a raid of the Pirate Bay file-sharing website in May 2006. Swedish officials have acknowledged that part of the motivation for the raid was the threat of sanctions from the World Trade Organization, along with a letter from the MPAA.\n\nIn 2013 the Center for Copyright Information unveiled the Copyright Alert System, a system established through an agreement between the MPAA, the Recording Industry Association of America, and five of the USA's largest internet service providers. The system used a third-party service to identify content being distributed illegally. Users were then informed that their accounts were being used for possible copyright infringement and were provided with information about ways to get authorized content online. Users who received multiple notices of infringement faced \"mitigations measures,\" such as temporary slowing of their Internet service, but the system did not include termination of subscriber accounts. Subscribers facing such action had a right to appeal to the American Arbitration Association. In January 2017, the Copyright Alert System was discontinued. While no official reason was given, the MPAA's general counsel stated that the system had not been equipped to stop repeat infringers.\n\nOn December 24, 2014, the Sony Pictures hack revealed that following a lawsuit in which the MPAA won a multimillion judgment against Hotfile, a file hosting website, the MPAA colluded with Hotfile to misrepresent the settlement so that the case would serve as a deterrent. The settlement was previously believed to be $80 million and was widely reported; however, Hotfile only paid the studios $4 million and agreed to have the $80 million figure recorded as the judgment and the website shut down.\n\nIn a case resolved in 2015, the MPAA and others supported the United States International Trade Commission (ITC)'s decision to consider electronic transmissions to the U.S. as \"articles\" so that it could prevent the importation of digital files of counterfeit goods. While the case being considered by the ITC involved dental appliances, the ITC could have also used such authority to bar the importation of pirated movies and TV shows from rogue foreign websites that traffic in infringing content. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals took up the matter, and ultimately ruled against the ITC.\n\nIn 2016, the MPAA reported Putlocker as one of the \"top 5 rogue cyberlocker services\" to the Office of the United States Trade Representative as a major piracy threat; the website was then blocked in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe MPAA has also produced publicity campaigns to discourage piracy. The \"Who Makes Movies?\" advertising campaign in 2003 highlighted workers in the movie industry describing how piracy affected them. The video spots ran as trailers before movies, and as television advertisements. In 2004, the MPAA began using the slogan \"You can click, but you can't hide\". This slogan appeared in messages that replaced file-sharing websites after they had been shut down through MPAA legal action. It also appeared in posters and videos distributed to video stores by the MPAA. Also in 2004, the MPAA partnered with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore to release a trailer shown before films in theaters equating piracy with theft. The trailer was later placed at the beginning of the video on many DVDs in such a way that it could not be bypassed (not being able to skip or fast-forward), which triggered criticism and a number of parodies.\n\nIn 2005 the MPAA commissioned a study to examine the effects of file sharing on movie industry profitability. The study concluded that the industry lost $6.1 billion per year to piracy, and that up to 44 percent of domestic losses were due to file sharing by college students. In 2008, the MPAA revised the percentage of loss due to college students down to 15 percent, citing human error in the initial calculations of this figure. Beyond the percentage of the loss that was attributable to college students, however, no other errors were found in the study.\n\nIn 2015, theaters began airing the MPAA's \"I Make Movies\" series, an ad campaign intended to combat piracy by highlighting the stories of behind-the-scenes employees in the film and television industry. The series pointed audiences to the MPAA's \"WhereToWatch\" website (later dubbed \"The Credits\") which provides attention to the behind-the-scenes creativity involved in making movies.\n\nThe MPAA itself has been accused of copyright infringement on multiple occasions. In 2007, the creator of a blogging platform called Forest Blog accused the MPAA of violating the license for the platform, which required that users link back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA had used the platform for its own blog, but without linking back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA subsequently took the blog offline, and explained that the software had been used on a test basis and the blog had never been publicized.\n\nAlso in 2007, the MPAA released a software toolkit for universities to help identify cases of file sharing on campus. The software used parts of the Ubuntu Linux distribution, released under the General Public License, which stipulates that the source code of any projects using the distribution be made available to third parties. The source code for the MPAA's toolkit, however, was not made available. When the MPAA was made aware of the violation, the software toolkit was removed from their website.\n\nIn 2006, the MPAA admitted having made illegal copies of \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\" (a documentary exploring the MPAA itself and the history of its rating system) — an act which \"Ars Technica\" explicitly described as hypocrisy and which Roger Ebert called \"rich irony\". The MPAA subsequently claimed that it had the legal right to copy the film despite this being counter to the filmmaker's explicit request, because the documentary's exploration of the MPAA's ratings board was potentially a violation of the board members' privacy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26206304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26206304", "title": "Movement director", "text": "Movement director\n\nA movement director arranges actors' movements in a variety of production settings that include theatre, television, film, opera and animation. Movement directors usually work closely with the director and the performers, collaborating with the creative team to realise the physical life of a work. They propose a physical language to performers and directors, and devise training methods or teach skills that will help facilitate a specific physical style. The movement director may create, or research and pass on, embodied information about etiquette, ethnicities (including proxemics, gestural language, social codes, etc.), a character’s condition (related to medical conditions within their historical context, and factors such as inebriation, pregnancy, etc.) and personal journey (ageing, etc.), as well as specialist movement (e.g. period dances, dexterity in falling, lifts and acrobatics, animal work, cross-gendered performance) or chorus work.\n\nAlthough choreography is part of a movement directors’ skill-set, this does not mean that every choreographer is also a movement director. There are also important differences between the movement director and the fight director, where although the movement director will engage with the effect of the relevant weapons on posture, movement and emotional state, the fight choreography itself is directed by the specifically qualified fight director. \nSpecialist movement consultants may focus on other specific areas (e.g. as in the work on primate movement by the puppeteer Peter Elliot in \"\").\n\nThe role described by the title of Movement director today has been in existence since at least the start of the 20th century, although rarely mentioned in programmes or credits. Movement directors often work at a crossover point, shifting between teaching and directing movement for actors, and have also been termed as Movement coach, Theatre choreographer, or Movement support. \nThe National Theatre created the role Head of Movement that was held by Jane Gibson for a period of ten years. Glynn MacDonald has been the long-standing Master of Movement at The Globe Theatre, underpinning the work of each season and collaborating with visiting movement directors and choreographers. \n2009 saw an important development in the appointment of Struan Leslie as Head of Movement at the Royal Shakespeare Company. This was the only official Head of Movement position within a British theatre company at the time.\nMany contemporary Movement directors have established long running relationships with certain companies, with whom they have created a shared body of work and working methodology. These are for example Jane Gibson with Cheek by Jowl, Kate Flatt and Struan Leslie with Katie Mitchell at the National Theatre and English National Opera, and Liz Ranken with Shared Experience. \nOther contemporary Movement directors include Michael Ashcroft, Peter Darling, Lucy Cullingford, Vanessa Ewan, Lea Hausmann, Steven Hogget and Scott Graham (Frantic Assembly), Georgina Lamb, Sue Lefton, Ita O'Brien, Liz Ranken, Dennis Sayers, Toby Sedgwick, Ayse Tashkiran, Sian Williams, Anne Yee, Imogen Knight, Paul Harris, Diane Mitchell, Anna Morrissey, Paul Sadot.\n\nMovement directors today emerge from a rich heritage of movement pedagogues and practitioners. French Director and practitioner Jacques Lecoq, and movement theorist and pedagogue Rudolf Laban offer important influences. Many of their students and contemporaries became influential teachers of movement and Movement directors in British theatre, often influenced by and interweaving with the lineage of contemporary dance as influenced by Laban, and the heritage of social and cultural dances.\nClaude Chagrin, who trained with Jacques Lecoq, was the ‘movement person’ with the National Theatre Company before and while it became permanently resident in Denys Lasdun’s National Theatre Building in 1976. She was also the first person to be credited for movement, on a production of \"The Royal Hunt of the Sun\" (Dir. Peter Shaffer, 1964). \nMichel Saint-Denis taught movement in London and was an influential associate director alongside Peter Brook at the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1962–1966, introducing influences from his work in Paris with his uncle Jacques Copeau. \nOther notable teachers who have shaped British movement work today through a heritage that is passed on from body to body, are Trish Arnold, Geraldine Stephenson, Jean Newlove, Litz Pisk, Yat Malmgren and Belinda Quirey. Their work underpins the practice and understanding of contemporary movement practitioners and gives physical life to actors’ performances at Drama Schools and in productions across Britain.\n\nMovement Directors have sought to be named, in recognition of the existence of their profession, for many decades, and are increasingly gathering recognition. Relevant training for practitioners is now offered through recognized Higher Education degrees focusing on Movement in theatre, such as the MA in Movement studies at The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, founded by Vanessa Ewan and Debbie Green in 2004, and now jointly led by Ayse Tashkiran and Vanessa Ewan re titled MA/MFA Movement: Directing and Teaching and the MA in Training Actors Movement, led by Wendy Allnutt at The Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Manchester Metropolitan University also offers an MA in Movement Practice for Theatre. \nMovement director and MA/MFA Movement: Directing and Teaching course leader at The Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), Ayse Tashkiran, is researching a comprehensive history of movement direction and creating a platform where movement practitioners are able to share their work and facilitate an understanding of their profession by a wider audience.\nIndustry initiatives to draw out the work of movement directors include the Young Vic and the RSC with a variety of workshops, apprenticeships and placements.\n\n\nEwan, V and Green, D.

{"id": "3986392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3986392", "title": "Pleo", "text": "Pleo\n\nPLEO is an animatronic pet dinosaur toy manufactured by Innvo Labs, a company located in Hong Kong and Nevada. The toy has the appearance and (imagined) behavior of a week-old baby \"Camarasaurus\" dinosaur. It was designed by Caleb Chung, the co-creator of the Furby, Chung's company Ugobe first sold Pleo and was manufactured by Jetta Company Limited. The species of dinosaur chosen allows for concealing the sensors and motors needed for the animation, since it has a big body shape and relatively large head. According to their website, each Pleo would \"learn\" from its experiences and environment through artificial intelligence and develop an individual personality.\n\nPLEO was unveiled on February 7, 2006 at the DEMO Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona and was expected to come on the Indian and American markets around Fall 2007. PLEO shipments started on December 5, 2007.\n\nIn April 2009, Ugobe laid off all of its employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nOn June 8, 2009 the original PLEO manufacturer Jetta announced it is re-launching Pleo and are continuing the line including accessories such as the vital battery and battery charger components. Since 14 July 2009, PLEO is owned by Innvo Labs Corporations (a division of Jetta).\n\nIn December 2011, the second generation, PLEO rb, was first launched in America, Europe and Hong Kong where Innvo Labs headquarter locates.\n\nIn July 10, 2017 the NPR \"Hidden Brain\" interviewer Shankar Vedantam used a pleo robot on the stage of the \"Aspen Ideas Festival\" to illustrate some issues of \"robot ethics\" while interviewing Kate Darling of MIT's Media Lab.\n\n\nBeginning in December 2008, Pleoworld.com began to experience technical problems. By the Christmas holidays, Pleoworld was offline, including the user forums. After the holidays, both Pleoworld and Ugobe's official websites displayed updating website messages. Both sites returned sometime at the beginning of 2009. Ugobe official website updated its board of directors listing. Ugobe stated that the problems were due to the company's relocation but had not explained why the user forums have not been restored.\n\nWired News reported the company's outlook was not good, and it was struggling to save itself from extinction as it tried to raise new funding and keep its pipeline of products alive.\n\nFrom November 2008, the company saw a host of top management departures, including two CEOs, moved its office in California, and pared down its marketing and Public Relations staff in an attempt to weather the current economic storm. (This may be the reason for Pleoworld's demise.) Emails to the company's media contact on its website bounced back. Phone calls to its corporate office were not answered.\n\nIn July 2008, Ugobe CEO Bob Christopher stepped down and former CFO Liz Gasper retook control of the company. Christopher said he left the company to move on to other ventures. Gasper had focused on cutting down the company's burn rate and finding new funding.\n\nWith the collapse of the United States credit environment, though, fund raising came to a halt. Meanwhile, the company's entire board of directors resigned before December, 2008, giving control of Ugobe back to the co-founders.\n\nUgobe also closed its Emeryville, California office and moved all operations to its new offices in Boise, Idaho. The company then had about twenty employees.\n\nIt had become extremely difficult for new PLEOs owners or existing members of the website to access the official forums and Plogs. In the wake of these problems, a loyal fan has set up a forum for members to join to talk Pleo, get the latest Pleo news, and download firmware updates for Pleo.\n\nOn April 17, 2009 Ugobe filed chapter 7 bankruptcy, and halted the production of new PLEOs.\n\nOn June 8, 2009 Jetta acquired PLEO and later in July, Innvo Labs was founded for the development of PLEO business while Jetta continued to manufacture for the PLEO line. Innvo Labs is a division of Jetta and is a privately held company based in Hong Kong. Jetta and Innvo Labs is committed to re-launch the PLEO line and continue the line of products including accessories such as the recovery battery and charger components for Ugobe PLEO.\nIn order to strengthen its brand, Innvo Labs is decided to enhance their customer service, and so set up a customer service hotline and email to collect public opinions and reply to customer inquiries on PLEO and PLEO rb.\n\nIn December 2011, the latest iteration, the PLEO rb (Standing for ReBorn), was invented and released.\nPLEO rb is similar to the original PLEO. However, no two units are exactly alike: each PLEO rb comes with randomly selected eyeball, eyelid and eye-shadow colours. The skin is always a slightly different hue of green. A special line of pink or blue PLEO rb were released in late 2012.\nPLEO rb has more senses than the original. The enhancements include:\nThere are altogether 9 new kinds of food and medicine items made for PLEO rb in different health and life situations and 7 new \"learning stones\": these can teach PLEO rb how to bow, dance, sign, walk towards their owner, play games, etc.\n\nPLEO rb is designed to behave like a life-form, with 4 distinct life stages. When unboxed, it behaves like a newborn and needs to be \"hatched\" and brought up. With proper care, it will \"grow up\" into a juvenile after about two days. It starts to stand and walk smoothly during its teenage stage, and can then be taught to recognize its name. As owners continue to teach verbal commands, it will get to the mature stage and all features will be fully enabled.\n\n"}

In June 1890, Harding performed in the musical play \"Billie Taylor\" in New York City as part of the Ideal Opera Company. In March 1893, he played Nixey Weld in \"A Night at the Circus\" at the Harrigan's Park Theatre in New York. Also in 1893 he joined the minstrel company of Sam Devere, author of \"The Whistling Coon\" made famous by George W. Johnson.\n\nIn 1897, Harding began manufacturing phonograph records at 18 E. 22nd St., New York, and late in the year sold the operation to the Excelsior Phonograph Company (later Excelsior and Musical Phonograph Company). Harding continued managing recording for the Excelsior company until August of the following year, when he was replaced in that role by fellow recording artist William F. Hooley. He began recording around this time for the Columbia Phonograph Company (which had relocated from Washington, D.C. to New York City), Berliner Gramophone and National Phonograph Company (Edison). In addition to his own solo recordings of popular songs, Harding sang duets with Len Spencer, Steve Porter, Minnie Emmett and Myra Price, and was a member of the Spencer Trio, Imperial Minstrels and Greater New York Quartette.\n\nBy 1898, Harding had become associated with the Strakosch and Hess Grand English Opera Company and the Nellie McHenry Company, managing stage production and choirs as well as singing. In late 1898, Harding formed the Knickerbocker Music Publishing Company in New York with singer Steve Porter and pianist Fred Hylands, but the company was reformed as Hylands, Spencer and Yeager (with Len Spencer and Harry Yeager) in early 1899, apparently before any publishing commenced. In mid-1899, Harding began his own music publishing firm at 1180 Broadway, New York, then 53 W. 28th St., New York in Tin Pan Alley. In June 1901, Harding made his last recordings, for the Victor Talking Machine Company. By August 1901 Harding had moved his publishing business to the Johnson Building in Brooklyn, and died suddenly at this workplace on August 29, due to a viral infection. Harding is buried at the Maple Grove Cemetery in Queens.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "449608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=449608", "title": "Skill testing question", "text": "Skill testing question\n\nSkill testing questions (or STQ) are a legal requirement attached to many contests in Canada.\n\nThe combined effect of Sections 197 to 206 of the Canadian Criminal Code bans for-profit gaming or betting, with exceptions made for provincial lotteries, licensed casinos, and charity events. Many stores, radio stations, and other groups still wish to hold contests to encourage more purchases or increase consumer interest. These organizations take advantage of the fact that the law does allow prizes to be given for games of skill, or mixed games of skill and chance. To make the chance-based contests legal, such games generally consist of a mathematical skill-testing question (STQ). Penalties for violating the contest section of the Criminal Code, if it was enforced, include up to two years of imprisonment if charged as an indictable offence or a fine no more than $25,000 on a summary conviction charge. \n\nThe Promotional Contest Provision of the Competition Act also states that \"selection of participants or distribution of prizes is not made on the basis of skill or on a random basis.\"\n\nCourts have accepted that estimating number of beans in a jar as a game with skill and number of votes will be cast in an upcoming election as a game with mixed skill and chance. Thus neither examples require additional STQ as the skill component has been met.\n\nThe most common form that these questions take is as an arithmetic exercise. A court decision ruled that a mathematical STQ must contain at least three operations to actually be a test of skill. For example, a sample question is \"(2 × 4) + (10 × 3)\" (Answer: 38). The winner should not receive any assistance (e.g. using a calculator, asking another individual to calculate the answer for the winner) in answering the STQ. Enforcement of these rules is not very stringent, especially for small prizes. Enforcement is often impossible if the winner chooses the time and location to answer the question (for example, the question is attached to the prize claim form). In most cases, there is no individual monitoring to ensure the integrity of answering STQ without assistance and the winner will submit the claim form having affirmed that they completed STQ without any assistance. In some cases, the player may not be required to answer the STQ to claim a prize. The questions are also becoming easier. For contests held in other countries but open to Canadians, a STQ must be asked of any potential Canadian winner.\n\nSince those sections of the Criminal Code require elements of skill for the winners to be awarded of their prize, not answering the STQ correctly can result in the prize not being awarded. This has happened in at least one occasion for Tim Hortons' Roll Up the Rim contest winner in 2008. The individual failed to answer the same STQ correctly on the prize claim form twice due to a learning disability. Tim Hortons refused to release the prize until the intervention of a local newspaper. Anecdotally, getting the answer wrong is often not an obstacle to claiming a prize and the winner is given another chance to calculate again. \n\nThe same section of law prohibits receiving consideration in exchange for playing the games, resulting in a related peculiarity of Canadian contests: the \"free entry alternative\", which is usually indicated by \"No purchase necessary\" in the fine print. Generally this means that it is possible to enter the contest for free by, for example, writing a letter to the entity sponsoring the contest and requesting a game piece or entry form.\n"}

Key information categories include: \n\nThe objectives of software visualization are to support the understanding of software systems (i.e., its structure) and algorithms (e.g., by animating the behavior of sorting algorithms) as well as the analysis and exploration of software systems and their anomalies (e.g., by showing classes with high coupling) and their development and evolution. One of the strengths of software visualization is to combine and relate information of software systems that are not inherently linked, for example by projecting code changes onto software execution traces.\n\nSoftware visualization can be used as tool and technique to explore and analyze software system information, e.g., to discover anomalies similar to the process of visual data mining. For example, software visualization is used to monitoring activities such as for code quality or team activity. Visualization is inherently not a method for software quality assurance. Software visualization participates to Software Intelligence in allowing to discover and take advantage of mastering inner components of software systems.\n\nTools for software visualization might be used to visualize source code and quality defects during software development and maintenance activities. There are different approaches to map source code to a visual representation such as by software maps Their objective includes, for example, the automatic discovery and visualization of quality defects in object-oriented software systems and services. Commonly, they visualize the direct relationship of a class and its methods with other classes in the software system and mark potential quality defects. A further benefit is the support for visual navigation through the software system.\n\nMore or less specialized graph drawing software is used for software visualization. A small-scale 2003 survey of researchers active in the reverse engineering and software maintenance fields found that a wide variety of visualization tools were used, including general purpose graph drawing packages like GraphViz and GraphEd, UML tools like Rational Rose and Borland Together, and more specialized tools like Visualization of Compiler Graphs (VCG) and Rigi. The range of UML tools that can act as a visualizer by reverse engineering source is by no means short; a 2007 book noted that besides the two aforementioned tools, ESS-Model, BlueJ, and Fujaba also have this capability, and that Fujaba can also identify design patterns.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The line included professional video cameras, video monitors and linear video editing systems.\n\nSony first demonstrated a wideband analog video HDTV capable video camera, monitor and video tape recorder (VTR) in April 1981 at an international meeting of television engineers in Algiers. The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-1000 video recorder, with its companion HDT-1000 processor/TBC, and HDS-1000 video switcher all working in the 1125-line component video format with interlaced video and a 5:3 aspect ratio.\n\nThe helical scan VTR (the HDV-100) used magnetic tape similar to 1\" type C videotape for analog recording. Sony in 1988 unveiled a new HDVS digital line, including a reel-to-reel digital recording VTR (the HDD-1000) that used digital signals between the machines for dubbing but the primary I/O remained analog signals. The large unit was housed in a 1-inch reel-to-reel transport, and because of the high tape speed needed, had a limit of 1-hour per reel. Sony, owner of Columbia Pictures/Tri-Star, would start to archive feature films on this format, requiring an average of two reels per movie. There was also a portable videocassette recorder (the HDV-10) for the HDVS system, using the \"UniHi\" format of videocassette using 3/4\" wide tape. The transport housing similar in appearance to Sony's D1/D2 Standard Definition Digital VTRs, but recorded analog HD. The small cassette size limited recording time.\n\nThe Sony HDVS system is used in the production of a 5-min feature film about Halley's Comet in 1986, titled \"Arrival\", and shown in US theatres later that year, using 35mm film instead of tape.\n\nThe first drama film shot using the HDVS professional video camera is RAI's \"Julia and Julia (Italian: Giulia e Giulia\") in 1987, and the first HDTV television show was CBC's \"Chasing Rainbows\", shot using the HDVS system in 1988. For the Genesis Invisible Touch Tour shows at Wembley Stadium in July 1987, the Sony HDVS system was used to film these shows and later released in VHS and LaserDisc in 1988 and DVD in 2003.\n\n\"\" (also known as \"Then There Were Giants\") is a 1994 TV movie, directed by Joseph Sargent, that stars John Lithgow, Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins as the three major Allied leaders. It was the first video production to be produced in the 1125-line high-definition television (HDTV) format. It was converted to NTSC for broadcast in the United States.\n\nThe HDVS brand and logo is still used by Sony nowadays (as \"Digital HDVS\", since the original HDVS line of equipment from 1984 used wideband analog video to achieve the 1125-lines of resolution) on their current digital high-definition HDCAM-format cameras such as the Sony HDW-750 and HDW-F900.\n\nCamera System\n\nCamera System/Optional Accessories\n\nVTR System\n\nOptional Accessories\n\nPost-Production Equipment\n\nOptical Fiber Transmission System\n\nProjection System\n\nColor Monitors\n"}

The show was created by Carl Reiner and starred Dick Van Dyke, Rose Marie, Morey Amsterdam, Larry Mathews, and Mary Tyler Moore. It centered on the work and home life of television comedy writer Rob Petrie (Van Dyke). The show was produced by Reiner with Bill Persky and Sam Denoff. The music for the show's theme song was written by Earle Hagen.\n\nThe series won 15 Emmy Awards. In 1997, the episodes \"Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth\" and \"It May Look Like a Walnut\" were ranked at 8 and 15 respectively on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. In 2002, it was ranked at 13 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time and in 2013, it was ranked at 20 on their list of the 60 Best Series.\n\nThe two main settings show the work and home life of Rob Petrie (Dick Van Dyke), the head writer of a comedy/variety show produced in Manhattan. Viewers are given an \"inside look\" at how a television show (the fictitious \"The Alan Brady Show\") was written and produced. Many scenes deal with Rob and his co-writers, Buddy Sorrell (Morey Amsterdam) and Sally Rogers (Rose Marie). Mel Cooley (Richard Deacon), a balding straight man and recipient of numerous insulting one-liners from Buddy, was the show's producer and the brother-in-law of the show's star, Alan Brady (Carl Reiner). As Rob, Buddy, and Sally write for a comedy show, the premise provides a built-in forum for them to constantly make jokes. Other scenes focus on the home life of Rob, his wife Laura (Mary Tyler Moore), and son Ritchie (Larry Mathews), who live at 148 Bonnie Meadow Road in suburban New Rochelle, New York. Also often seen are their next-door neighbors and best friends, Jerry Helper (Jerry Paris), a dentist, and his wife Millie (Ann Morgan Guilbert).\n\n\"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" was preceded by a 1960 pilot for a series to be called Head of the Family with a different cast, although the characters were essentially the same, except for the absence of Mel Cooley. In the pilot, Carl Reiner, who created the show based on his own experiences as a TV writer, played Robbie Petrie, with a long first \"e\": PEE-tree. Laura Petrie was played by Barbara Britton, Buddy Sorrell by Morty Gunty, Sally Rogers by Sylvia Miles, Ritchie by Gary Morgan, and Alan Sturdy, the Alan Brady character, was played by Jack Wakefield, although his face was never fully seen, which was also the case with Carl Reiner's Alan Brady for the first several seasons of \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\".\n\nThe pilot was unsuccessful, which led Reiner to rework the show with Dick Van Dyke playing the central character (who went by Rob, not \"Robbie\", and pronounced his last name PETT-ree.)\n\nThe pilot was subsequently the basis of the series episode \"Father of the Week\".\n\nAt least four episodes were filmed without a live studio audience: \"The Bad Old Days,\" which featured an extended flashback sequence that relied on optical effects that would have been impractical to shoot with a live audience in the studio; \"The Alan Brady Show Presents,\" which required elaborate set and costume changes; \"Happy Birthday and Too Many More,\" which was filmed on November 26, 1963, only four days after President Kennedy's assassination; and \"The Gunslinger\", which was filmed on location.\n\nReiner considered moving the production of the series to full color as early as season three, only to drop the idea when he was informed that it would add about $7,000 to the cost of each episode. On December 11, 2016, two episodes from the series were presented on CBS-TV colorized. Two more colorized episodes aired December 22, 2017.\n\n\"The Last Chapter\" was the last episode that aired; \"The Gunslinger\" was the last episode filmed.\n\nMain:\n\nSupporting:\n\nRecurring:\n\nA group of character actors played several different roles during the five seasons. Actors who appeared more than once, sometimes in different roles, included Elvia Allman (as Herman Glimscher's mother), Tiny Brauer, Bella Bruck, Jane Dulo, Herbie Faye, Bernard Fox, Dabbs Greer, Jerry Hausner, Peter Hobbs, Jackie Joseph, Sandy Kenyon (who also appeared in the 2004 reunion special), Alvy Moore, Isabel Randolph, Burt Remsen, Johnny Silver, Doris Singleton, Amzie Strickland, George Tyne, Herb Vigran and Len Weinrib. Frank Adamo, who served as Van Dyke's personal assistant and stand-in, also played small roles throughout the show's five seasons.\n\nMany of the show's plots were inspired by Reiner's experiences as a writer for \"Your Show of Shows\" and \"Caesar's Hour\", both of which starred Sid Caesar. Reiner based the character of Rob Petrie on himself, but Rob's egocentric boss Alan Brady is not based on Caesar, but is a combination of the abrasive Milton Berle and Jackie Gleason, according to Reiner.\n\nCBS had intended to cancel the show after its first season, but Procter & Gamble threatened to pull its advertising from \"the network's extremely lucrative daytime lineup\" and the show was renewed, keeping its Wednesday night time slot. The show jumped into the top 10 by the third episode of its second season, helped by coming directly after \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", the number one show at the time.\n\n\nThe show's theme was by Earle Hagen, who also wrote many other TV series themes, including those for \"The Danny Thomas Show\", \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"Gomer Pyle, USMC\", \"I Spy\", and \"The Mod Squad\".\n\nIn a 2010 interview on National Public Radio, Van Dyke revealed Morey Amsterdam's lyrics for the show's theme song:\n\n\"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" was nominated for 25 Primetime Emmy Awards and won 15.\n\n\n\nImage Entertainment has released all five seasons of \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" on DVD in Region 1. Season sets were released between October 2003 – June 2004. Also, on May 24, 2005, Image Entertainment repackaged the discs from the individual season sets into a complete series box set. On Blu-ray, the complete series, remastered in high definition, was released on November 13, 2012.\n\nIn Region 2, Revelation Films has released the first two seasons on DVD in the UK.\n\nIn Region 4, Umbrella Entertainment has released the first three seasons on DVD in Australia.\n\nFollowing the well-received colorizations of \"I Love Lucy\" in the US, two episodes, \"That’s My Boy\" and \"Coast to Coast Big Mouth\", were computer colorized by West Wing Studios in 2016 and broadcast by CBS. They were later released on DVD and Blu-ray by CBS Home Entertainment as \"The Dick Van Dyke Show: Now in Living Color!\"\n\nSix episodes of the series are believed to have lapsed into the public domain and have been released by numerous discount distributors.\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}

It stars Robin Williams, Jim Caviezel, Mira Sorvino, Mimi Kuzyk, Stephanie Romanov, Genevieve Buechner and Brendan Fletcher. The film takes place in a setting where memory implants make it possible to record entire lives. Williams plays a professional who specializes in editing the memories of unsavory people into uncritical memorials that are played at funerals.\n\nThe film won the award for best screenplay at the Deauville American Film Festival and was nominated for best film at the Sitges Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nA brief introduction describes \"cutters\", who edit the collected memories of the recently dead into feature length memorials that are viewed by loved ones at funerals. Their code forbids them to have the requisite implant or to sell memories.\n\nThe film opens with Alan Hakman as a child. While visiting a city with his parents, he meets another boy, Louis, and the two bond as they play together. Louis reluctantly joins Hakman in exploring an abandoned factory, and Hakman crosses a wooden plank suspended high above the ground. Goaded by Hakman, Louis also attempts to cross the plank, but he loses his confidence and falls. Hakman races to the ground and panics when he steps in what he thinks is Louis' blood. Hakman flees the scene and tells no one what happened. Later that day, he leaves the city with his parents.\n\nYears later, Hakman (Robin Williams) is a skilled cutter who specializes in editing the memories of controversial people into hagiographies. When Fletcher (Jim Caviezel), a former cutter, confronts him at a funeral, Hakman describes himself as a sin-eater, who brings redemption to the immoral. Fletcher offers him $500,000 for the memories of his latest client, wealthy businessman Charles Bannister, but Hakman refuses. In a later meeting, Fletcher demands the memory recordings so that he can use Bannister, who he suspects was a pedophile, as a scandal to shut down EYE Tech. Hakman again refuses, and, worried for his safety, uses his knowledge from memory tapes to shake down a shady criminal for a pistol.\n\nAs Hakman works through Bannister's memories, he encounters a scene that implies that Bannister was molesting his daughter, Isabel. Hakman wordlessly deletes it and presses on. He eventually comes upon a person that he is convinced must be his childhood friend Louis. Excited, he sets up a meeting with Bannister's family to find out more information. Bannister's wife is dismissive, but Isabel reveals that the man, recently dead of a car crash, was a teacher named Louis Hunt. Hoping that Hunt had an implant, Hakman organizes a break-in at EYE Tech, but they have no record of Hunt. Instead, Hakman finds a file on himself, which he is surprised to find documents his parents' purchase of an implant for him.\n\nIn his distress, Hakman turns to his lover, Delila. At his apartment, he shows her the equipment that he uses to view memories, and he demonstrates surreal footage from a defective implant. He leaves her alone as he seeks help from anti-implant protestors, who have discovered a way to block the implant through specialized body modification. When he returns to his apartment, he assumes that Fletcher has broken in; instead, Delila confronts him after having found memory tapes that document her prior relationship. She accuses him of voyeurism and angrily destroys his memory viewer, which results in Bannister's files also being damaged.\n\nFletcher and his associate finally break in, but they find nothing. Hakman tells Bannister's wife that the footage was lost in an accident, and she feigns disappointment, content to let dirty secrets stay hidden. Hakman asks his colleagues to recover live footage, a potentially deadly process. They agree, but admonish him that he can never cut memories again; a cutter with an implant is a violation of the \"Cutter's code\". The resulting memories show Hakman attempt to dissuade Louis from crossing the plank and stepping in red paint, not blood. Hakman, relieved, visits Hunt's grave but is confronted again by Fletcher, who has learned about Hakman's implant. After chasing Hakman through the graveyard, he hesitates and seems willing to let Hakman go; however, Fletcher's associate kills Hakman.\n\nIn the last scene, Fletcher loads Hakman's memories into a viewer and promises to use them for the greater good. As he pages through Hakman's memories, looking for evidence of Bannister's guilt, he sees Hakman watching himself in a mirror, and the memory implant lingers on the scene after Hakman has left.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" premiered October 15, 2004. It grossed $548,039 domestically and $3,070,786 internationally. Lionsgate Home Entertainment released it on DVD on March 22, 2005.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 37% of 79 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 5.3/10. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 43 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Roger Ebert rated it 3/4 stars and wrote that \"the movie never really finds its way out of the dilemmas it has created\", but Williams' acting saves it from these issues. Leslie Felperin of \"Variety\" wrote that it has \"strong visuals\" but called it cliched and poorly acted. Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" wrote that it was poorly edited and features an emotionless performance from Williams. Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote the film fails to deliver on its promising premise. Daniel W. Kelly of DVD Talk rated it 4.5/5 stars and called it \"an intriguing, unassuming drama with sci-fi elements that doesn't get bogged down in sci-fi overkill\".\n\n\n"}

The poem is recited in , by Tweedledum and Tweedledee to Alice. The poem is composed of 18 stanzas and contains 108 lines, in an alternation of iambic trimeters and iambic tetrameters. The rhyme scheme is ABCBDB, with masculine rhymes throughout. The rhyming and rhythmical scheme used, as well as some archaisms and syntactical turns, are those of the traditional English ballad.\n\nThe Walrus and the Carpenter are the characters in the poem, which is recited by Tweedledum and Tweedledee to Alice. Walking upon a beach one night when both sun and moon are visible, the Walrus and Carpenter come upon an offshore bed of oysters. Groups of four are called up; the exact number is unknown. To the disapproval of the eldest oyster, many more follow them. After walking along the beach (a point is made of the fact that the oysters are all neatly shod despite having no feet), the two main characters are revealed to be predatory and eat all of the oysters. After hearing the poem, the good-natured Alice attempts to determine which of the two leading characters might be the more sympathetic, but is thwarted by the twins' further interpretation:\n\nThe characters of the Walrus and the Carpenter have been interpreted many ways both in literary criticism and popular culture. Some, including the character Loki in the film \"Dogma\", interpret the Walrus to be a caricature of the Buddha and the Carpenter to be a caricature of Jesus Christ. British essayist J. B. Priestley argued that the figures were political, as does Walter Russell Mead, who utilises the Walrus and the Carpenter as an allegory for Britain and the United States respectively. However, in \"The Annotated Alice\", Martin Gardner notes that, when Carroll gave the manuscript for \"Looking Glass\" to illustrator John Tenniel, he gave him the choice of drawing a carpenter, a butterfly, or a baronet, since each word would fit the poem's metre. Because Tenniel rather than Carroll chose the carpenter, the character's significance in the poem is probably not in his profession, and interpretations of the poem as a commentary on religion are likely false. Gardner cautions the reader that there is not always intended symbolism in the \"Alice\" books, which were made for the imagination of children and not the analysis of \"mad people\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is written in 12-line tail-rhyme stanzas, with the rhyme scheme AABCCBDDBEEB, and is number 983 in the \"Index of Middle English Verse\". It is possible that it draws some inspiration from the Middle English \"Sir Eglamour of Artois\". The romance survives only in the fifteenth-century East-Midland manuscript Manchester, Chetham's Library, MS 8009 (folios 76r-119v). The romance describes the tortuous efforts of the young earl's son Torrent to win the hand of Desonell, daughter of King Colomond of Portugal, against her father's wishes. Amongst other feats, Torrent fights five giants on different occasions and travels to Jerusalem. The romance ends with Torrent and Desonell's marriage and the uniting of their family. It has been characterised as 'perhaps the most critically neglected member of the Middle English verse romances'.\n\n"}

During the Edwardian and First World War eras she performed and recorded popular songs such as \"Take Me Back to London Town\" and \"Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey\".\n\nMonks was born in Blackpool, Lancashire on 1 November 1884, the daughter of Charles Monks. She was educated in both England and Belgium. In 1899 she made her first stage appearance as \"Little Victoria\"; her first appearance in London was at the Oxford Music Hall on 9 March 1903. She went on to appear in all the leading Music Halls, both in London and the provinces. She married the American songwriter and Music Hall manager Karl F. Hooper and by 1911, they were living in Lambeth, London with a daughter. In 1915 she was prevented from working following an accident which involved a stage door at one of the Moss Empires theatres; she became bankrupt shortly afterwards.\n\nShe died in London in 1927 and is buried in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery near Harlesden, London. Her great-granddaughter Chloe Hooper was born in Basingstoke and grew up in Silchester – she is both an international vocalist and Tribute Act today.\n\nMonks performed and recorded a number of popular songs of her day.

{"id": "31413267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31413267", "title": "White power music", "text": "White power music\n\nWhite power music is music that promotes white nationalism. It encompasses various music styles, including rock, country, experimental music and folk. Ethnomusicologist Benjamin R. Teitelbaum argues that white power music \"can be defined by lyrics that demonize variously conceived non-whites and advocate racial pride and solidarity. Most often, however, insiders conceptualized white power music as the combination of those themes with pounding rhythms and a charging punk or metal-based accompaniment.\" Genres include Nazi punk, Rock Against Communism, and National Socialist black metal.\n\nBarbara Perry writes that contemporary white supremacist groups include \"subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music.\" According to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission \"racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the Internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits.\" An article in \"Popular Music and Society\" says \"musicians believe not only that music could be a successful vehicle for their specific ideology but that it also could advance the movement by framing it in a positive manner.\"\n\nDominic J. Pulera writes that the music is more pervasive in some countries in Europe than it is in the United States, despite some European countries banning or curtailing its distribution. European governments regularly deport \"extremist aliens\", ban white power bands and raid \"organizations\" that produce and distribute the music. In the United States, racist music is protected freedom of speech in the United States by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nCountry music has spawned several subgenres, including white racist country music — also referred to as \"segregationist music\" — which came about in response to the American civil rights movement. The songs expressed resistance to the federal government and civil rights advocates who were challenging well-established white supremacist practices endemic in the Southern United States. There were also changes in the music recording industry in the 1940s and 1950s that allowed regional recording companies to form across the United States, addressing small specialized markets. B.C. Malone writes: \"the struggles waged by black Americans to attain economic dignity and racial justice provided one of the ugliest chapters in country music history, an outpouring of racist records on small labels, mostly from Crowley, Louisiana, which lauded the Ku Klux Klan and attacked African Americans in the most vicious of stereotypical terms.\"\n\nThe artists often adopted pseudonyms, and some of their music was \"highly confrontational, making explicit use of racial epithets, stereotypes and threats of violence against civil rights activists. Much of the music \"featured blatantly racist stereotypes that dehumanized African Americans\", equating them with animals or \"using cartoonish imagery associated with \"Jigaboos\"\". Lyrics warned of \"white violence\" on African Americans if they insisted on being treated as equals. Other songs were more subtle, couching racist messages behind social critiques and political action calls. The lyrics, in the tradition of right-wing populism, questioned the legitimacy of the federal government and rallied whites to protect \"Southern rights\" and traditions. The song \"Black Power\" includes the lyrics:\nIn 1966, businessman Jay \"J.D.\" Miller created a niche record label for his company, the defiantly segregationist Reb Rebel Records. It was arguably the most notable of the racist country music record labels. Reb Rebel released 21 singles and \"For Segregationists Only\", an album of its ten bestselling songs, four of which were Johnny Rebel's. The label's first single, \"Dear Mr. President\" (referring to then-president Lyndon B. Johnson), by Happy Fats (Leroy Leblanc), sold more than 200,000 copies. The song parodied Johnson's Great Society programs, which aimed to eliminate poverty and racial injustice. Other songs were primarily about civil rights or the Vietnam War, \"but they never really attacked black people.\" The studio's second release, \"Flight NAACP 105\" by \"the Son of Mississippi\" (Joe Norris), was the label's bestseller; the track was a \"spontaneous skit in the vein of \"Amos 'n' Andy\".\" It was the first in a series of \"highly racist take-offs\" of \"Amos n’ Andy\". Few of Miller's racist records were played on the radio in Louisiana.\n\nJohnny Rebel, the pseudonym that Cajun country musician Clifford Joseph Trahane used on racist recordings issued in the 1960s, became the \"forefather of white power music.\" Johnny Rebel's six singles (12 songs altogether), frequently use the racial epithet \"nigger\", and often voiced sympathy for racial segregation and the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), such as his first B-side \"Kajun Ku Klux Klan\", which was a \"cautionary tale centered on the story of 'Levi Coon' who dared to demand that he be served in a café.\" The songs were \"vehemently anti-black, its pro-segregationist lyrics set to the twangs of the era's swampbilly craze.\"\n\nBecause of bootlegged records and Internet interest, Johnny Rebel's career never ended; in the late 1990s he was rediscovered, and he re-released his music on CD and promoted it with his own website. The site, however, did not spark new interest outside his fanbase until September 11 attacks of 2001. Johnny Rebel recorded and released \"Infidel Anthem\", about \"the whipping America should lay on Osama bin Laden,\" leading to an appearance on \"The Howard Stern Show\", where his new compilation CD and the new song were promoted. At the time, Stern's show had a peak audience of around 20 million.\n\nMichael Wade argues that Johnny Rebel \"influenced British racist musicians, notably the band Skrewdriver, which inspired other right-wing musicians.\"\n\nNazi punk music is stylistically similar to most forms of punk rock, although it differs by having lyrics that express hatred of Jews, homosexuals, communists, anarchists, anti-racists and people who are not considered white, as opposed to the often left-wing lyrics of punk rock. In 1978 in Britain, the white nationalist National Front (NF) had a punk-oriented youth organization called the Punk Front. Although the Punk Front only lasted one year, it included a number of white power punk bands such as The Dentists, The Ventz, Tragic Minds and White Boss. The Nazi punk subculture appeared in the United States by the early 1980s during the rise of the hardcore punk scene.\n\nThe Rock Against Communism movement originated in the United Kingdom in late 1978 with activists associated with the NF. The most notable RAC band was Skrewdriver, which started out as a non-political punk band but evolved into a white power skinhead band after the original lineup broke up and a new lineup was formed. They were the \"most dominant white racial extremist band\" and were idealized in the \"emerging movement that arose in response to perceptions of political liberalism, diversity, and the loss of a power in the white community.\" Skrewdriver advocated on behalf of extreme right-wing and racist politics, and its frontman Ian Stuart Donaldson identified himself as a British neo-Nazi. The group performed mainly for other white power skinheads and \"asserted the need for extremist political violence.\" Bands that followed their lead also \"fused racist ideology, heavy metal and hard rock styles\", embracing \"aggressive racism and ethnic nationalism\".\n\nNational Socialist black metal (NSBM) is black metal that promotes National Socialist (Nazi) beliefs through their lyrics and imagery. These beliefs often include: white supremacy, racial separatism, antisemitism, heterosexism, and Nazi interpretations of paganism or Satanism (Nazi mysticism). According to Mattias Gardell, NSBM musicians see \"national socialism as a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal. Bands whose members hold Nazi beliefs but do not express these through their lyrics are generally not considered NSBM by black metal musicians, but are labelled as such in media reports. Some black metal bands have made references to Nazi Germany purely for shock value, much like some punk rock and heavy metal bands. According to Christian Dornbusch and Hans-Peter Killguss, völkisch pagan metal and neo-Nazism are the current trends in the black metal scene, and are affecting the broader metal scene. Mattias Gardell, however, sees NSBM artists as a minority within black metal.\n\n\n\n"}
