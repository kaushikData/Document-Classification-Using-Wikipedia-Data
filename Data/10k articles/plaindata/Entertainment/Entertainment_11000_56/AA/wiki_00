It means that without time off from work, a person becomes both bored and boring. The exact origins of the phrase remain unclear, though it was recorded as early as 1659.\n\nThough the spirit of the proverb had been expressed previously, the modern saying appeared first in James Howell's \"Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish\" (1659), and was included in later collections of proverbs. It also appears in Howell's \"Paroimiographia\" (1659), p. 12.\n\nSome writers have added a second part to the proverb, as in \"Harry and Lucy Concluded\" (1825) by the Irish novelist Maria Edgeworth:\n\nThe proverb has been used widely throughout popular media, notably including James Joyce's short story \"Araby\" to Jack Kerouac's \"Big Sur\", the 1957 movie \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", and the 1980 horror movie \"The Shining\", directed by Stanley Kubrick. In Kubrick's film the main character, Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson), is found to have abandoned the play he was writing in favor of typing this sentence over and over onto reams of paper. A number of other works have subsequently included a direct homage to the scene.\n"}

It was also where Brian Lara twice set the record for highest individual Test innings, scoring 375 in 1994 and the current record of 400 not out in 2004, both times against England.\n\nIn May 2003 the West Indies completed the highest ever successful run chase in Test Cricket at the ARG, making 418/7 against Australia in their fourth innings to win by 3 wickets. \n\nAntigua is considered to be a good wicket on which to bat — hard and dry whilst not offering much bounce or movement to bowlers. This is colloquially known as a \"featherbed\".\n\nAfter the building of the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium for the 2007 World Cup, no further Test cricket was expected at the Recreation Ground. However, due to the abandonment of the Second Test between West Indies v England on 13 February 2009 after just ten balls (due to an unfit outfield), an extra Test, called the Third Test, began at the Antigua Recreation Ground on 15 February 2009, despite concerns about the dilapidated condition of the stadium.\n\nLike many other cricket grounds in the Caribbean, the Antigua Recreation Ground traditionally hosts a variety of off the field entertainment, particularly music, both live and recorded, during breaks in play.

{"id": "25198689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25198689", "title": "Assassin's Creed III", "text": "Assassin's Creed III\n\nAssassin's Creed III is a 2012 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and Microsoft Windows. It is the fifth major installment in the \"Assassin's Creed\" series, and a direct sequel to 2011's \"\". The game was released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, beginning in North America on October 30, 2012, with a Wii U and Microsoft Windows release following in November 2012. A remastered version will be released for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2019.\n\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The story is set in the 18th century, before, during and after the American Revolution from 1754 to 1783, and follows Desmond's half-English, half-Mohawk ancestor, , also known as Connor, as he fights the Templars' attempts to gain control in the colonies.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed III\" is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Connor's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Connor is able to freely explore 18th-century Boston, New York City, and the American frontier to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game also features a multiplayer component, allowing players to compete online to complete solo and team based objectives including assassinations and evading pursuers. Ubisoft developed a new game engine, Anvil Next, for the game.\n\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, who praised it for its gameplay, narrative, diverse cast of characters, visuals and grand, ambitious scale, while criticism was directed at the unevenly developed gameplay mechanics and the glitches within the game. It was a massive commercial success, selling more than 12 million copies worldwide. Its sequel, \"\", was released in October 2013, and follows Ratonhnhaké:ton's grandfather – Edward Kenway – a pirate and Assassin operating in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy.\n\nIn September 2018, a remastered edition of \"Assassin's Creed III\" was announced as a downloadable add-on to \"Assassin's Creed Odyssey\".\n\n\"Assassin's Creed III\" is a third-person action-adventure title set in an open world in which the player uses a combination of stealth, parkour, and combat to complete various missions. The player takes the role of three characters during the course of the game. The main character is Desmond Miles, a 21st-century Assassin, working to uncover the secrets of a mysterious Precursor Vault that will protect the Earth from an upcoming solar flare on December 21, 2012. To uncover the secrets, Desmond uses the Animus to live out memories of two of his ancestors which the player controls during these sequences, both set at the time of the American Revolutionary War. The first, briefly played at the start of the game, is Haytham Kenway, a British Templar who seeks the location of the Vault. The second, and the primary character for the game, is Ratonhnhaké:ton, the result of a brief liaison between Kenway and a Native American woman. Ratonhnhaké:ton takes on the name Connor to blend in better with colonial society. When playing as Connor, the player has access to a huge wilderness known as the Frontier (which is 1.5 times bigger than Rome in \"\"), the cities of Boston and New York City. Portions of the Eastern Seaboard and Caribbean Sea can be explored via the flagship of the Assassins' navy, the \"Aquila\", captained by Connor Kenway himself, with Robert Faulkner his first-mate advising and teaching him in the ways of the sea.\n\nFree running has been simplified to allow for more fluid parkour in the cities and wilderness, such as climbing and running on trees, mountains, cliffs, etc. Close combat has been modified, allowing Connor to dual-wield weapons and take down multiple opponents at once and players no longer need to manage the lock-on mechanic. Aiding this, Connor has access to a wide range of weapons which include muskets, swords, pistols, native weapons such as the tomahawk and bow and arrow, a rope dart (used to pull foes or hang them, while on a tree) as well as the Hidden Blades. In addition, the left Hidden Blade has a folding mechanism for blocking attacks, skinning an animal, and performing high-profile assassinations. Human shields can be used against firing lines of enemies. Medicine is no longer used as health recovers automatically. Stealth is also revamped, allowing players to use natural elements such as tall grass and trees to hide, along with the ability to blend between any two people.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed III\" features new weather simulations such as snow, fog, and rain. The seasons can also change i.e., Summer and Winter, which not only affect visuals but also gameplay, as the player will find that they run slower in deep snow. Snowfall can reduce visibility for the player and enemies, aiding stealth. Unlike the past games, this one includes animals varying from domestic (horses, cows, dogs) to wild (deer, wolves, bears). The wild ones are found in the Frontier, and can be hunted for meat or marrow in order to be sold. The quality of the kill determines the price, encouraging the player to hunt silently. For this, traps and bait can also be used.\n\nEconomy is now based on the Davenport Homestead, which also acts as Connor's adoptive home. The site can be visited by people such as carpenters, tailors etc. suffering from displacement due to the war. Helping and interacting with these non-player characters (NPCs) will encourage them to settle in the Homestead. From there on, the player can craft various items and trade with them, and then sell the goods to the cities via caravan. The player can also help them build relationships with each other, which will then result in the formation of a small village. The player can also upgrade the Homestead manor as well as Connor's ship, the Aquila.\n\nA revamped version of \"\"s recruitment feature returns as players can enlist citizens to the Assassins' cause by completing \"Liberation\" missions. They also have a much larger skill set, which allows them to start a riot, provide a covert escort, act as a personal bodyguard etc. Other side missions include collecting Almanac pages, exploring underground tunnels to locate fast-travel stations, joining hunting and fighting clubs, investigating frontiersman rumors about UFOs and Sasquatch, \"peg-leg\" missions in which Connor goes to underground forts and wastelands to uncover the legend of Captain Kidd's treasure, and others.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed III\" also features naval expeditions. Using Connor's warship, the \"Aquila\", the player can navigate the high seas. Control of the ship relies on environmental factors such as wind direction and speed, local presence of storms, high waves, and rocks. Engagements are by cannon, with broadsides covering both flanks of the ship, swivel guns that can be used to damage smaller ships which can also be boarded to find treasure, and chain shots from the broadsides as well to take down the masts of larger ships and disable them. The \"Aquila\" is used in the side missions known as \"Privateer missions\" and is also used in some of the main missions.\n\nThe Wii U version of the game has extra features. The player has the ability to change weapons on the go and the map is always visible on the Wii U Gamepad. The Wii U version also supports Off TV Play. With this feature enabled, the main screen is redirected to the Wii U Gamepad.\n\nOnline multiplayer returns in this installment by Ubisoft Annecy. Along with returning modes, new ones feature a co-operative mode named Wolfpack, in which 1–4 players are charged with killing certain NPCs within a time limit, through a sequence of 25 stages. It also features Domination, a team mode where players will have to capture certain areas of the map, protecting them from the opposing team.\n\nFollowing the events of \"Assassin's Creed: Revelations\", the game explores the life of an 18th-century assassin in Colonial America during the American Revolution; a half-English, half-Mohawk man named Ratonhnhaké:ton, also known as Connor, whose father is Grand Master of the Templar Order in the colonies. Connor is caught up in the Assassins' conflict with the Templar order when his Native American village is attacked by the Templars, who intend to seize control of the newly forming country.\n\nConnor's story spans through two decades of his life. From his childhood in 1760 to 1783. Boston and New York City are cities that can be explored, as well as the American Colonial Frontier, spanning forest, cliffs, rivers, Connor's Mohawk village, and the settlements of Lexington, and Concord. The player can hunt small and large animals, and approximately one third of the story takes place in the Frontier. The city of Philadelphia can also be visited at one point during the game, as can The Caribbean during several naval missions. The entire Eastern seaboard is also explorable via Connor's captaining his naval warship, the \"Aquila\".\n\n\"Assassin's Creed III\" features a large cast of characters. The main character is Ratonhnhaké:ton (Noah Watts), also known as Connor, an 18th-century assassin.\n\nThe 18th century characters include Achilles Davenport (Roger Aaron Brown), Connor's mentor and a retired assassin; Connor's mother Kaniehtí:io or Ziio (Kaniehtiio Horn); Connor's first mate aboard the \"Aquila\" Robert Faulkner (Kevin McNally); and the French taverner Stephane Chapheau (Shawn Baichoo). The Colonial Templars are led by Connor's father, the English nobleman Haytham Kenway (Adrian Hough). He is aided by several historical figures who are portrayed as members of the Templar order including Charles Lee (Neil Napier), Thomas Hickey (Allen Leech), John Pitcairn (Robert Lawrenson), Benjamin Church (Harry Standjofski), William Johnson (Julian Casey), and Nicholas Biddle. The era also features several other historical figures such as Israel Putnam (Andreas Apergis), George Washington (Robin Atkin Downes), Thomas Jefferson (John Emmet Tracy), Mason Weems (Tod Fennell), Paul Revere (Bruce Dinsmore), Edward Braddock, Benjamin Franklin (Rick Jones), and Samuel Adams (Mark Lindsay Chapman).\n\nOther characters include Minerva (Margaret Easley) and Juno (Nadia Verrucci), members of Those Who Came Before; and the Grand Master of the 18th century Templar Order in England, Reginald Birch (Gideon Emery).\n\nImmediately after the events of , Desmond Miles, his father William, with allies Rebecca Crane and Shaun Hastings find the Temple of the First Civilization in a cave in New York and access it using their Apple of Eden, an ancient artifact of immense power. After partially activating the temple, Juno uses it to communicate with Desmond. Desmond is placed in the Animus where Juno's influence causes him to experience the life of his ancestor Haytham Kenway in 1754 century England.\n\nHaytham assassinates a patron at the Royal Opera House and steals a medallion; the Key to the Temple's inner chamber. Haytham is dispatched to the American Colonies to locate the Temple. While in Boston, he kills a slave trader, freeing a group of Mohawks including a woman named Kaniehti:io, who asks Haytham to refer to her as Ziio after he proves unable to pronounce her full name. She helps Haytham find the Temple in exchange for him killing General Braddock. Haytham and Ziio find that the Key is not able to open the temple itself. The pair develop a romantic relationship during their time together, which results in a son, Ratonhnhaké:ton. Haytham is then seen inducting a new member, Charles Lee into the Order, only for it to be shown to actually be the Templar Order instead of the Assassins.\n\nThe perspective then shifts to Ratonhnhaké:ton's childhood in 1760. His mother dies during an attack on his village which Ratonhnhaké:ton believes was led by the Templar Charles Lee. Years later, the village Elder informs a teenage Ratonhnhaké:ton that their tribe's duty is to prevent the Temple's discovery. The Elder gives him a transparent Sphere which allows Juno to communicate with him; she tells him of his importance and shows him the Assassins' symbol. The symbol leads him to the retired Assassin Achilles Davenport, who reluctantly begins training him as an assassin.\n\nAchilles suggests Ratonhnhaké:ton rename himself \"Connor\" to enable him to move more freely throughout the Colonies, in fear that some colonists might reject him as a tribe member. While seeking supplies in Boston, Connor is framed by the Templars for instigating the Boston Massacre. Over the following years, Connor kills several Templars, and aids in the Revolutionary War between the Patriots and the British. Connor meets with his father, and the two forge a temporary alliance to eliminate a rogue Templar. Later, Haytham uncovers a letter detailing George Washington's plan to remove the Indigenous population, including Connor's tribe, from the frontier to prevent them supporting the Loyalists. Connor returns to his village and learns that Lee has recruited several Mohawk warriors to turn back the Patriots sent to eradicate them. Connor neutralizes the warriors to avoid conflict, but his childhood friend Kanen'tó:kon cannot be reasoned with and Connor is forced to kill him.\n\nMeanwhile, Desmond is occasionally roused from the Animus to retrieve power cells from Manhattan and Brazil, necessary for activating the Temple, before the Templar Daniel Cross can take them. William goes after the final cell himself, but is captured by the Templars' modern day front, Abstergo Industries. Desmond assaults the facility, kills Cross and Warren Vidic, and rescues his father.\n\nConnor becomes conflicted about eliminating the Templars, and hopes to work with Haytham towards a common vision of peace and freedom. However, Haytham remains convinced of the chaos of freedom and the necessity to control the nation by replacing Washington with Lee. Lee is disgraced by Washington for attempting to sabotage the outcome of the Battle of Monmouth and takes refuge in the heavily fortified Fort George. Connor infiltrates the fort and is confronted by Haytham; they duel, and Connor kills him. Connor later kills Lee and recovers the Key. With the Colonial Templars eliminated, Connor returns to his village only to find it empty, and the Sphere left behind. Using it, Juno instructs him to conceal the Key where it cannot be found; Connor buries the Key in the grave of Achilles' son, Connor Davenport.\n\nIn 2012, Desmond retrieves the Key and accesses the Temple's inner chambers. Juno informs him that activating the pedestal will save the world, but at the cost of his life. Minerva appears before them, opposing the plan as it will free Juno, who was sealed away in the temple to prevent her conquering humanity. Juno and Minerva explain that if the solar flare occurs, Desmond will be one of the few survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. After Desmond's later death, he will become revered as a god, whose well-intended legacy will be manipulated to control future generations, restarting the cycle. Desmond chooses to sacrifice himself in order to save humanity and give them the opportunity to fight Juno rather than be destroyed. William, Shaun, and Rebecca leave the temple as Desmond activates the pedestal; a global aurora protects the planet from the solar eruption. Juno commends Desmond's choice and declares that it is time for her part to begin.\n\nIn an epilogue, Connor takes down the Templar portraits in the Davenport Manor's basement and burns them, signifying the end of his journey. In addition, his return to his village is detailed further, showing he spoke to a hunter there, who revealed that the land had been sold to settlers in order to settle the new United States government's war debts. Connor also travels to the pier in New York, where he witnesses the last of the British Regulars leave America for good. However, he also sees evidence of the slave trade present in the newly formed nation, right next to the pier of citizens cheering at the departure of the British, learning that not all people have been freed.\n\nFollowing this, a modern-day voiceover can be heard directing the player to locate a number of 'pivot points' that have been spread out across the memories' graphical representation of Colonial America. Once collected, the voiceover returns to congratulate, and informs that they have now connected to the .\n\nWork on \"Assassin's Creed III\" began in January 2010 (almost immediately after the release of \"Assassin's Creed II\") by a senior team of Ubisoft developers. The title was in development for two and a half years and had the longest development cycle since the first \"Assassin's Creed\". When Ubisoft first revealed \"\" in 2010, as new details came to light, there was some confusion within the gaming community as to whether this would be \"Assassin's Creed III\". According to the developers, \"Brotherhood\" was not \"Assassin's Creed III\", and the third installment would not star a \"pre-existing character.\" Ubisoft Montreal's developers stated in their interviews that \"Assassin's Creed III\" would be released eventually.\n\nJean-François Boivin of Ubisoft also stated that each numbered title in the series will introduce a new lead character and a new setting. Patrice Désilets, former series' creative director, said that the series has always been planned as a trilogy. He also commented on the story of \"Assassin's Creed III\", saying that it would focus on Assassins' quest to prevent the end of the world in 2012, and their race against time to find temples and Apples of Eden built by \"Those Who Came Before\". Desmond would be searching for clues as to the locations of these temples, by exploring memories of one (or more) of his other ancestors.\n\nIn October 2011 Alexandre Amacio, creative director of \"\", announced that the next installment of the franchise was to be released before December 2012, however, Amacio himself would not be directing the game. This comes from the idea that Desmond Miles, the modern day protagonist of the series, was to finish his tale by December 2012. Amacio said that gamers should not have to play a futuristic game after the time period in which it is set.\n\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot confirmed during an earnings call on November 8, 2011, that a new \"major\" \"Assassin's Creed\" game would be released in 2012. Guillemot refused to go into any further detail on the title beyond its confirmation. Speaking to MCV, Guillemot dismissed the notion that annual \"Assassin's Creed\" installments are diluting the brands, stating instead that they're necessary to \"satisfy the demand\". Guillemot also claimed in the same interview that this year's \"Assassin's Creed\" will be the series' \"biggest to date.\"\n\nIn February 2012, Ubisoft officially confirmed the existence of \"Assassin's Creed III\", and its North American release date of October 30, 2012. Guillemot described \"Assassin's Creed III\" as \"the true next generation of both the \"Assassin's Creed\" brand and interactive entertainment/storytelling in general. We will push the title a lot because it's a fantastic product that the team has been working on for three years. What we have seen is just fabulous.\" Guillemot went on to say the publisher's investing more heavily in the game than in any other title in the series.\n\nReports that \"Assassin's Creed III\" would take place during the American Revolution surfaced following a supposed \"inside source\" at Ubisoft, who made such a claim in January 2012. On February 29, 2012, an upcoming promotional image of the game was sent to Kotaku by a Best Buy employee, along with information from the retailer that a full reveal was imminent. The leaked promotional image led to a general consensus that the game was set in North America during the American Revolution, and at least in part, a snowy setting. Around the same time, Ubisoft mentioned \"a major announcement from Assassin's Creed\" was \"only days away\" via the series' official Facebook. The page's cover photo also depicted a snowy and bleak setting. Furthermore, \"Game Informer\" appeared ready to confirm the fresh details via an advertising banner posted on its site. Images showed the new assassin standing next to American revolutionary leader George Washington.\n\nFollowing the reports, Ubisoft released \"Assassin's Creed III\"s official box art on March 1, 2012, which confirmed the game's American Revolution setting. The company said it will announce \"all the details\" at 5pm on March 5. Additionally, \"Game Informer\" revealed its latest cover feature, which included more artwork of the game's new main character. On March 2, several screenshots were leaked ahead of Ubisoft's official reveal, and the first gameplay details emerged via \"Game Informer\".\n\n\"Assassin's Creed III\" was unveiled with a cinematic trailer on March 5, 2012. Ubisoft described the game as the \"most ambitious\" project in the company's history, with twice the production capacity of any previous title from the publisher. The game's engine, AnvilNext, delivers improved visuals, character models and AI, allowing for battlefields full of fighters. Ubisoft later said it's aiming to make \"Assassin's Creed III\" \"look next-gen\" on current-gen consoles using the new AnvilNext engine.\n\nUbisoft said that when Rockstar's \"Red Dead Redemption\" released midway through \"Assassin's Creed III\"s development, it was surprised to see Rockstar had included wild animal hunting and a giant frontier to explore—features both planned for its own sequel. Lead writer Corey May said Ubisoft's now looking at \"Red Dead\"s success and trying to take the formula in \"new directions\". Similarities between these two games are down to \"a convergence of minds\", said \"Assassin's Creed III\" writer Matt Turner. Creative Director Alex Hutchinson said Ubisoft steered clear of making the \"Assassin's Creed III\" protagonist a female character because the game's setting is not a strong match. Hutchinson said while many people wanted to see female assassins in the series, the American Revolution setting makes it difficult this time round.\n\nUbisoft recommends the PC version of the game to be played with a controller even though it will still support keyboard and mouse setup. Ubisoft Montreal's creative director Alex Hutchinson admitted: \"We're definitely supporting PC, we love PC, but I think it'll be PC with a controller. I don't see us investing hugely in a mouse and keyboard setup. I think if you want to play on PC and you want to play Assassin's Creed, you have a controller.\"\n\nThe score to \"Assassin's Creed III\" was composed by Scottish composer Lorne Balfe, who previously co-composed the soundtrack of \"\" with longtime \"Assassin's Creed\" series composer, Jesper Kyd. The game's soundtrack is the first soundtrack of the series' main games to not feature Jesper Kyd. The soundtrack was released via digital download on October 30, 2012. Balfe also composed the music within the DLC content, \"The Tyranny of King Washington\", with the soundtrack released via digital distribution on April 23, 2013.\n\nThe game also features additional compositions by Max Aruj, Dave Fleming, Andrew Kawczynski, Jasha Klebe, and Steve Mazzaro.\n\nUbisoft's senior vice president of sales and marketing, Tony Key, said the game would enjoy the biggest marketing commitment in company history. Ubisoft UK MD Rob Cooper has said that \"Assassin's Creed III\" is a good entry point for newcomers to the series, and that he thinks \"Assassin's Creed III\" will hold its own against this year's biggest releases. In March 2012, the \"Assassin's Creed: Double Pack\" was released both as a retail purchase for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and for download on PSN, which brings together the first \"Assassin's Creed\" and \"Assassin's Creed II\" in a virtual compilation box.\n\nUbisoft has collaborated with several retail outlets on pre-order bonuses available through several store chains throughout the world. Which of the pre-order bonuses the player received depended upon where they pre-ordered the game. A free SteelBook collectible featuring artwork by renowned comic book artist Alex Ross is available as a pre-order incentive. The \"Captain of the Aquila\" DLC pack includes a single player weapon (The \"Pirate Boarding Axe\") and a single player skin (\"The Captain of the Aquila's uniform\"). The \"Colonial Assassin\" DLC pack includes a single player weapon (The \"Scottish Flintlock\") and a single player skin (the \"Traditional Colonial Assassins outfit\"). \"Redcoat Multiplayer\" DLC pack includes redcoat costume, a snake emblem, and a \"doctor doll\" relic. In the US, Gamestop is offering the single-player mission \"Lost Mayan Ruins\" and the Sawtooth Sword, Best Buy is offering the single-player mission \"Ghost of War\" and the Pontiac's War Club, while Amazon is offering the Steelbook Case.\n\nSCEE offers a digital version of \"Assassin's Creed III\" via the PlayStation Store. Dubbed the \"Gold Edition\", the download includes the game, PlayStation Vita title \"\" and a Season Pass (a first for the series). Another version of the \"Gold Edition\" features the game and the Season Pass, but not \"Liberation\". Third version comes with \"Liberation\", but without the Season Pass. All versions include \"A Dangerous Secret\", the extra mission available with the \"Special Edition\".\n\nDutch site Entertainment Business reported that thieves made off with a truck on November 14, 2012, in transporting the entire launch shipment of \"Assassin's Creed III\" on PC for Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Ubisoft stated that it won't affect launch as copies will be sourced elsewhere. Those who pre-ordered the \"Join or Die\" edition, however, were affected as allegedly this cannot be re-manufactured. Ubisoft also passed on serial numbers and barcodes to retailers of the stolen games, and placed the same numbers on a blacklist preventing them from receiving online authentication.\n\nAmerican global technology company Nvidia bundled the PC version of \"Assassin's Creed III\" with its new GeForce GTX 650 Ti. It is built on the Kepler architecture along with others in the Nvidia's 600 series of GPUs. According to Nvidia, \"Assassin's Creed III\" makes the most of the TXAA technology. Ubisoft Australia put together a \"very special, very limited\" edition of \"Assassin's Creed III\" to auction off in benefit of the Sydney Children's Hospital Foundation. There are only ten of these editions in the world, and eight of them will be auctioned off to raise money for the Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick. Each will be auctioned separately between November 30, 2012 and December 17.\n\nIn June 2012 Ubisoft and in particular its French-Canadian subsidiary Ubisoft Montreal had to fend off increasing accusations of anti-British prejudice after trailers and box art depicting the killing of British Redcoats started to appear. One site described the 'July 4' live-action trailer as \"American nationalism\". Lead script writer Corey May defended the developers and publisher Ubisoft from allegations of bigotry and discrimination. This controversy, however, continued because marketing materials continued to depict only the British as the enemy, with a number of gaming news outlets noting US trailers cutting scenes that did seem to depict the protagonist killing Patriots. The publisher eventually decided that the Limited Edition of the game wouldn't be sold in the UK or Europe.\n\nHowever upon the game's release, critics said their depiction was balanced and fair. \"Official Xbox Magazine UK\" felt that \"the strongest aspect of ACIII is the more mature moral tone – there's none of the anticipated 'yay, America'.\" In another review by Kotaku, the reviewer notes \"publishers from big video game companies are not known for subtlety or complexity of theme\", going on to say \"the marketing always suggested that Assassin's Creed III's igniting of the Revolution would be a game of interactive jingoism; its developers always said it was not. The developers were the ones being accurate.\"\n\nOn March 26, 2012, Ubisoft announced three collectors' editions of \"Assassin's Creed III\", The \"Freedom\", \"Join Or Die\" and \"Special\" editions, exclusive to EMEA countries and Australia. On June 1, 2012, Ubisoft also announced another collectors' edition of \"Assassin's Creed III\", the \"UbiWorkshop\" Edition. Ubisoft and Sony partnered to offer the game as a bundle with the PlayStation 3 console, which was offered from the day of the game's release. On the day of its release, \"Assassin's Creed III\" on the PlayStation 3 received four exclusive single-player missions, titled \"The Benedict Arnold Missions\". The gameplay revolves around Benedict Arnold and his connections with turning West Point over to the British. Script writer Matt Turner stated that the Benedict Arnold missions were some of the most historically accurate missions in the game, as \"some scenes have the actual words spoken by key players in the events at West Point, according to the records from the court proceedings following what happened.\"\n\n\nOn October 3, 2012 Ubisoft officially revealed a Season Pass for downloadable content (DLC), made available for a six-month time period on PlayStation Network and on Xbox Live.

The pack includes the Governor, Highlander and Coyote Man multiplayer characters and the Charlestown, Fort St-Mathieu and Saint Pierre maps.\n\nOn October 3, 2012 Ubisoft revealed the first portion of DLC for the game, called \"The Tyranny of King Washington.\" The story revolves around an alternative history \"The United Kingdom of America\", wherein George Washington has seized an Apple of Eden, becomes corrupted by its power, and dubs himself King. The player is tasked with overthrowing the dictator. The single-player campaign is separated into 3 episodic installments. In the DLC, Ratonhnhaké:ton gains new abilities: the \"Power of the Bear\" for strength, the \"Power of the Eagle\" for speed, the \"Power of the Wolf\" for stealth, \"Warpaint\" to enhance the abilities, and \"Alpha of the Pack\", giving the ability to call wolves to help in battle.\n\nOn January 24, 2013, the first episode of the DLC was announced, titled \"The Infamy\". Set in 1783, Ratonhnhaké:ton awakens from what appears to be an alternative reality where the events of the main game involving him have never happened. He is tasked to find George Washington, corrupted heavily by the Apple of Eden. Washington has crowned himself King and begun to enslave and massacre the Frontier's population. Ratonhnhaké:ton must do everything in his power to dethrone him to return the land to freedom, including utilizing the new abilities granted to him. The first episode was released on February 19 for Xbox 360 and PC, February 20 for PlayStation 3, and on February 21 for the Wii U.\n\nOn February 6, 2013, it was announced that the second episode, titled \"The Betrayal\", would be released on March 19 for Xbox 360, PC and PlayStation 3 and an unknown date for Wii U (available in the eShop as of March 27) and that the third episode, titled \"The Redemption\", would be released on April 23 for Xbox 360, PC and PlayStation 3. Despite being given a release date of May 16 for Wii U, \"The Redemption\" has been available in the eShop since April 27.<ref name=\"Episodes 2/3\"></ref>\n\n\"Assassin's Creed III\" received positive reviews, with critics praising the visuals, narrative, combat style, hunting mechanics, naval missions and Homestead system, while complaining about the game's glitches and some of the missions' prescriptive layouts. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 85.56% and 85/100, the Xbox 360 version 84.92% and 84/100, the Wii U version 83.00% and 85/100, and the PC version 80.75% and 80/100.\n\nDaniel Bischoff of GameRevolution gave it 5/5 stars, saying \"Combining the best of the franchise so far, ASSASSIN'S CREED III doesn't disappoint long-time fans who've been with the series while also making it easy enough to jump in for the kill.\"\n\nIGN gave the game a score of 8.5/10, saying \"It achieves so much that you can't help but respect it, no other open world game has ever given us a setting that's as impressive to observe or as full of things to do as this\". They did however say \"Not everything about the game gels together convincingly and the missions' unnecessary prescriptiveness sometimes undermines the sense of freedom that the rest of the game works so hard to create\". GameSpot gave a similar review, stating \"It takes chances with its opening, with its story, and with its characters. It expands the series' gameplay in enjoyable and sensible ways. As with many ambitious games, not every arrow fired hits the bull's eye, yet this big, narratively rich sequel is easy to get invested in\" and gave a score of 8.5/10. \"Game Informer\" awarded the game 9.5/10, saying \"\"Assassin's Creed III\" delivers everything the series has promised, and throws in a little more for good measure ... Most players will likely spend the first six hours of \"Assassin's Creed III\" wrapping their heads around the profound size and ambition of the game\".\n\nG4 felt that \"\"Assassins Creed III\" [was] not perfect ... But there is so much story, so much multiplayer, and so much stuff to do that your average 10 hour game should be terribly ashamed of itself\". \"Official Xbox Magazine\" gave it 8.5/10, and said \"[Its] newly refined gameplay and incredibly rich setting are captivating stuff ... It improves on the underlying \"Assassin's Creed\" formula in a handful of subtle but tangible ways ... And its unwavering commitment to storytelling is both rare and impressive\". They did however criticize, \"Pacing problems which can drag the campaign into busy-work tedium\". \"PC Gamer\" was more critical, giving the game a 72/100 and stating that \"Assassin's Creed III\" had \"Entertaining storytelling and fantastic naval combat marred by terrible mission design and endemic feature creep\" The reviewer felt that homesteading detracted from the central theme and story, and narrowly scripted optional objectives punished players for thinking laterally. \"It's about pattern recognition rather than creative thought, binary reactions with no room for life or dynamism.\"\n\nIn December 2015, \"Game Informer\" ranked the game as the ninth best game in the \"Assassin's Creed\" series to date.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed III\" was nominated for six awards in the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards: Game of the Year, Best Xbox 360 Game, Best PS3 Game, Best Action Adventure Game, Best Graphics, and Character of the Year (Connor). GameTrailers awarded Assassin's Creed 3 Best Action-Adventure Game of the Year 2012 while Game Revolution named \"Assassin's Creed III\" its Game of the Year 2012. For the 2013 D.I.C.E. Interactive Achievement Awards, the game won the award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Animation\" and was nominated for \"Adventure Game of the Year\", and \"Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design\". \"Assassin's Creed III\" also received four Game Developer's Choice Awards nominations for \"Best Audio\", \"Best Narrative\", \"Best Technology\", and \"Game of the Year\".\n\nOn March 30, 2012, Ubisoft stated that in the three weeks since the game's pre-order campaign began, numbers had already surpassed the total U.S. pre-order numbers of \"\" and exceeded 10 times more than the pre-orders \"\" attracted in a comparable time frame. On October 25, 2012, Ubisoft announced that the game is the most pre-ordered game in the company's history, more than doubling pre-orders for \"Revelations\", the previous record holder.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed III\" was the bestselling game in the United Kingdom in the week of its release, with the best sales of the series to date. It was the biggest launch in publisher Ubisoft's history and the third biggest launch of any game in the UK in 2012 (behind \"\" and \"FIFA 13\"). It doubled the launch week sales of \"Assassin's Creed II\", and beat 2011's \"Revelations\" by over 117,000 copies. According to Ubisoft, \"Assassin's Creed III\" sold over 3.5 million units in its first week, which represents a 100 percent year-over-year increase from \"Revelations\". On December 12, 2012, Ubisoft announced that the game had sold 7 million copies worldwide. In the United Kingdom, \"Assassin's Creed III\" was the 3rd bestselling title of 2012, after being on sale for 2 months. According to the NPD Group, the game was the 4th bestselling game of 2012 in North America. On February 7, 2013, Ubisoft announced that the game had sold 12 million copies worldwide, representing an almost 70 percent increase over \"Revelations\" at the same point of its lifecycle, and making it the best-selling game in the franchise.\n\nOn November 14, 2012, Ubisoft reassured that the PC version of \"Assassin's Creed III\" will launch with fewer bugs than the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. A new patch was in the works to fix glitches on all versions. It was the second title update for the game following a large patch available day-one. The PC launch came with both of these patches included. After two days, Ubisoft detailed the sizable patch scheduled for release across the major platforms. This extensive patch was designed to address a list of around one hundred identified bugs present within the single-player campaign and online multiplayer modes plaguing the player experience. Some of the problems outlined involve substantial environmental instability, severe NPC technical issues, occasional console crashes and various issues involving sound synchronization amongst others.\n\nIn September 2012, franchise main writer Corey May stated that the \"Assassin's Creed III\" plot leaves possible sequels \"plenty of room to play\". \"Assassin's Creed III\" associate producer Julien Laferrière said that further \"Assassin's Creed\" games featuring new hero Connor depend on reaction to character, stating \"We made three games with Ezio because people loved Ezio.\" In November 2012, The Gaming Liberty spotted a supposed Ubisoft survey that suggested another annual installment could be set for release next year. The survey asked participants how they would feel about a return of Desmond, Connor and the American Revolution setting, and if they would purchase such a title if it were to be released next year, suggesting that Ubisoft had its eye on repeating the \"Brotherhood\" and \"Revelations\" route of the Ezio trilogy. The survey was also said to ask how participants would feel about the introduction of a co-op mode, and how they feel about Naughty Dog's \"Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception\", possibly suggesting a move to more scripted gameplay.\n\nOn February 28, 2013, Ubisoft posted their first promotional picture and cover for their next \"Assassin's Creed\" game, following leaked marketing material days before. Titled \"Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag\", it serves as a sequel to \"Assassin's Creed III\"s modern story and a prequel to its ancestral storyline. The game is set in the Caribbean islands during the Golden Age of Piracy, and centers around Edward Kenway; the father of Haytham Kenway, and grandfather of Ratonhnhaké:ton, the playable characters of \"Assassin's Creed III\".\n\n"}
{"id": "36042325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36042325", "title": "Assassin's Creed III: Liberation", "text": "Assassin's Creed III: Liberation\n\nAssassin's Creed III: Liberation is a 2012 action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft, initially as an exclusive title for PlayStation Vita. Sony announced the game at its press conference during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012, few days after first leaks about the game presented in \"Game Informer\". It was released on October 30, 2012 alongside \"Assassin's Creed III\", with which it can be linked. The game was re-released as Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows via the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and Steam, respectively. It was later packed as part of \"Assassin's Creed The Americas Collection\" for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, along with \"Assassin's Creed III\" and \"\". In May 2019, the game will be re-released as a part of \"Assassin's Creed III Remastered\" for Playstation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The game is set between 1765 and 1777, and primarily features the series' first female protagonist, Aveline de Grandpré, an African-French Assassin around the end of the French and Indian War, in 18th century New Orleans.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed III: Liberation\" retains the \"franchise's trademark open world and gameplay\", while making use of the PlayStation Vita's touchscreen and rear touch pad, cameras and gyroscope. These include Chain Kill combat, and the ability to pickpocket people. By linking the game to \"Assassin's Creed III\", the player receives an in-game version of Connor's tomahawk, an exclusive character skin, a multiplayer character and a complete upgrade of all ammunition pouches. The game uses the same engine that runs \"Assassin's Creed III\", allowing for the same gameplay experience as a console release. Aveline also has her own new set of animations as well as have the ability to dual-wield weapons, such as the new blowpipe as well as the familiar swords, knives, pistols and hidden blade.\n\nThe multiplayer, exclusive to the original Vita version, consists of players tapping nodes on a map, using characters (represented with static portraits) to capture bases and collect supplies, among other things. This differs from the series usual competitive multiplayer which had players assassinating each other for sport.\n\nIn the modern day, Abstergo Entertainment, a subsidiary of Abstergo which is in charge of producing multimedia goods, releases their first major product, \"Liberation\", a video game about the life of the Assassin Aveline de Grandpré. The game, however, is heavily censored, with any details regarding the Assassin-Templar war being omitted, in an attempt to portray the Assassins as the villainous force. As the player progresses through the game, they are greeted by messages from a group of hackers known as Erudito, giving them access to the full story hidden behind Abstergo's censoring attempts.\n\nThe main portion of the game takes place in Louisiana near the end of the French and Indian War, where France's defeat caused the city of New Orleans to be taken over by the Spanish Empire. The citizens were upset over the transition from French to Spanish control and Spain's new occupation within the city. However, in 1765, the French governor Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie made a negotiation with Templar Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer to stay as governor of New Orleans. This plot was later uncovered by Aveline, who infiltrated the governor's mansion and assassinated him.\n\nFollowing this, de Ferrer made another deal with a man named Baptiste, who was hoping to defect from the Assassins to the Templar Order. Baptiste took on the identity of the recently deceased François Mackandal, as a ruse to attract followers to his cause. His plan was to poison New Orleans' nobles and take control of smuggling operations within the Louisiana Bayou, although his sole purpose was actually to force Agaté, Assassin and mentor to Aveline, out of hiding in the bayou. His plot failed however, as Aveline tracked Baptiste down, killed his followers and assassinated the false Mackandal.\n\nIn 1766, the Templar Antonio de Ulloa arrived in New Orleans, to serve as the Spanish governor. However, he left control of the area to French officials and allowed the French flag to remain over the city. Two years afterwards, he made strict trade restrictions and set up a covert slave-trading operation to transport slaves to a Templar worksite in Mexico, creating a rebellion among French officials and the citizens of New Orleans.\n\nAgaté ordered Aveline to assassinate de Ulloa to eradicate Templar presence in New Orleans. Aveline ambushed de Ulloa's carriage and confronted the governor, who told her that slaves had been taken to Chichén Itzá. However, Aveline spared his life and let Ulloa leave the city, in return for a lens used to decode Templar documents and a map leading her to the Templar worksite in Chichén Itzá. Aveline's act of mercy destroyed any trust Agaté had in his student, as she had disobeyed his explicit orders.\n\nAveline disguised herself as a slave bound for Mexico and made her way to the Templar worksite at Chichén Itzá. Whilst there, she came across a defiant slave who mentioned that Jeanne, Aveline's mother, was stationed in Chichén Itzá. Aveline investigated thoroughly and uncovered a page from Jeanne's diary and a map that lead to an artifact located inside a cenote. Upon exploring this cave system, she came across an ancient chamber filled with ruins from the First Civilization, along with a fragment of the artifact she was searching for, known as the Prophecy Disk. Aveline then encountered de Ferrer, and killed him and his men. She was reunited with her mother who, after inadvertently revealing that she and Madeleine are Templars, warns her not to let the disk fall into Agaté's hands.\n\nTwo years later, Aveline returned to New Orleans to find that a man by the name of Vázquez was using Spanish soldiers to seize control of the bayou. She suspected him to be the head Templar of Louisiana, a.k.a. the Company Man, who de Ferrer had mentioned in Chichén Itzá. After retrieving the final piece of the Prophecy Disk in Chichén Itzá, Aveline went back to New Orleans once more to begin her quest in freeing slaves in the city. Her stepmother, Madeleine de L'Isle, became aware of her work and asked her to help a slave named George escape north. Whilst escorting him through the swamp, she met with her smuggler allies Élise Lafleur and Roussillon, helping them to deliver supplies to American Patriots who were fighting in the American Revolutionary War. Vázquez attempted to stop Aveline and her allies by sending Spanish soldiers their way, but Aveline defeated them and ensured George and the supplies reached their destination. After returning to the city, Aveline attended a governor's ball under disguise and managed to get close to Vázquez and assassinate him. However, to her surprise, Vázquez revealed that he was not the Company Man. Following this, Aveline learned that her father, who had been ill for some time, had died.\n\nIn 1777, Aveline headed to the New York Frontier, and teamed up with the Assassin Connor to find a Templar officer who was working for the Company Man. She discovered the officer to be George, the same slave she had freed years before, and the Company Man was none other than Madeleine. After confronting her stepmother at her mansion, Aveline traveled to the bayou and met with Agaté to inform him of her discovery. Agaté was unable to accept his failure and believing that Aveline had sided with the Templars, attacked her. Aveline overpowered him and attempted to convince him to leave Louisiana for his own safety, but Agaté could not live with the humiliation and instead chose to dive to his death. On realizing this, Aveline quickly attempted to save him, but only managed to grasp his necklace which tore away from his neck.\n\nFollowing her mentor's death, Aveline saw her situation as an opportunity to infiltrate the Templars and eradicate it from within. Upon returning to New Orleans, she made her way to the Saint Louis Cathedral and gave Madeleine Agaté's necklace to show her allegiance. Following this, she was inducted into the Templar Order by her stepmother. At this point, the Abstergo version of the game ends, but a final 'Erudito' mission reveals the true, uncensored ending. After her induction, Aveline gave Madeleine the two halves of the Prophecy Disk. However, she could not make sense of the scrambled messages within. Aveline saw this as her moment to strike and reclaim the Prophecy Disk. She eliminated all the Templars inside the cathedral and assassinated Madeleine.\n\nNow alone inside the cathedral, Aveline stepped up to the altar where the Prophecy Disk had been placed. She connected the locket she wore around her neck, which once belonged to her mother, to the artifact, causing it to display a holographic recording detailing a message from the time of the First Civilization. This message recounted the election of Eve as the leader of the rebellion during the Human-First Civilization War.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed III: Liberation\" was released on October 30, 2012, the same day as \"Assassin's Creed III\". The game is available in a PS Vita bundle pack with a new crystal white Wi-Fi Vita and a 4GB memory card. In Japan it was released under the title \"Assassin's Creed III: Lady Liberty\".\n\nIt was announced on September 10, 2013, that the game would be re-released as \"Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD\" for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows via the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and Steam, respectively, in 2014. The game features visuals closer to \"III\" as well as updated audio, AI and facial animations. Additional missions have been added and some of the Vita-specific touch screen missions have been removed, as well as the nodes multiplayer and a minor Quick Time Event minigame. The game was released on the PlayStation 3 on January 14, 2014 in North America and January 15, 2014 in Europe. The Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions were released worldwide on January 15, 2014.\n\nIt was announced on September 13, 2018 that \"Assassin's Creed III Remastered\" would be included in the \"\" season pass. Assassin's Creed III Remastered was announced to include all of its original DLC and a remastered version of Assassin's Creed III Liberation.\n\nPurchasing \"Assassin's Creed III\" for the PlayStation 3 gives the player the ability to connect \"Liberation\" and receive an exclusive mission to play in \"Liberation\" as Connor or Aveline, a Multiplayer Skin and an Ammunition Pouch.\nThere was also a promotional DLC, titled Mysteries of the Bayou pack, that came with pre-orders of the game in PAL regions. It included an exclusive weapon, an alligator hunting hat, a Multiplayer Skin and Ammunition Pouches for smoke bombs and poison darts.\n\nThese all feature in the HD remaster, save for the multiplayer skin, as that feature was removed.\n\nThe music in the game was composed by Winifred Phillips and produced by Winnie Waldron. The soundtrack album was released by Ubisoft Music on the same day as the release of the \"Assassin's Creed III: Liberation\" video game, October 30, 2012. Together with music producer Winnie Waldron, Winifred Phillips won several awards for her work on this project. For the music composition of the Assassin's Creed III Liberation video game, Phillips won a Global Music Award for musical excellence. Composer Winifred Phillips and music producer Winnie Waldron won a 2012 Hollywood Music in Media Award for the music score for \"Assassin's Creed III: Liberation.\" The main theme music of the Assassin's Creed III: Liberation video game won a G.A.N.G. Award from the Game Audio Network Guild in the category of \"Best Original Vocal Song — Choral.\"' The music of \"Assassin's Creed III Liberation\" won a GameFocus Award for Best Music of 2012. The game's musical score also received nominations in several year-end award competitions, including the GameZone Awards, the Best of IGN Awards, and the G4TV X-Play Best of 2012 Awards.\n\nThe music of \"Assassin's Creed III Liberation\" was very well received by both game and music critics. Robert Workman of GameZone wrote, \"The music is superb,\" and Evan Narcisse of Kotaku called the soundtrack, \"a stealthy success.\" Jen Bosier of VideoGameWriters said that the music of \"Assassin's Creed III Liberation\" was \"without question, the best soundtrack the series has seen to date.\" Music critic Randall Larson of BuySoundtrax.com stated, \"This is a fine score and one that even non-gamers should applaud for its cinematic, dynamic and immersive drive.\" Reviewer Lucas Smith of Piki Geek asserted that \"the soundtrack will go down as one of the year's best.\"\n\nInitial reviews for \"Assassin's Creed III: Liberation\" were mixed to positive. Metacritic, which assigns a score based on reviews from industry leaders, has the game scored at 70/100 based on 64 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nShaun McInnis, reviewer for GameSpot, gave the game a score of 6.5/10, praising the protagonist as \"...a woman born from the romance between a wealthy father and a slave mother, someone who has overcome her uncertain upbringing to find a new life in the Assassin Brotherhood\". McInnis also commended the setting, writing \"...a brilliant version of 18th-century New Orleans, one that beautifully reflects the diverse cultural ambience formed over years of operating as a French trading port\". However, he also wrote that the game \"squanders its most unique ideas...Liberation takes little advantage of its own narrative format\" and that the plot is \"largely aimless and hastily delivered\".\n\nIGN's Greg Miller stated, \"The moves and kills you'd expect are here, but the story is boiled down to be easy to jump in and out of. That takes away some of the excitement in playing through it\", giving it 7.2/10. In December 2015, \"Game Informer\" ranked the game as the 10th best game in the \"Assassin's Creed\" series to date.\n\n"}

{"id": "2301860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301860", "title": "BeIN Sports (Middle East TV network)", "text": "BeIN Sports (Middle East TV network)\n\nbeIN Sports () is a group of sports channels based in Doha, Qatar, serving the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. It is owned by beIN Media Group, a subsidiary of Al Jazeera Media Network. The channels primarily broadcast in Arabic, but it also offers feeds in English, French, and Spanish,\n\nFormerly known as Al Jazeera Sport, it was re-named beIN Sports in December 2013 to unify it with Al Jazeera's international group of sports networks in the lead-up to the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIn July 2013, the network acquired MENA rights to the Premier League. On 4 September 2017, the IOC announced a partnership with beIN Sports to launch a local linear version of Olympic Channel for MENA on 1 November 2017.\n\nThere are 11 Arabic-language sports channels in the beIN Sports group:\n\nBeginning June 2017, as part of a diplomatic crisis over alleged funding of extremist groups by the Qatari government, beIN was banned from selling its subscriptions in Saudi Arabia, and the beIN Sports channels were briefly banned in the United Arab Emirates (the ban was reversed the following month).\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, a service known as beoutQ emerged soon afterwards, which repackages beIN Sports channels as their own by overlaying its own digital on-screen graphics on the feed. The service's associated decoder boxes and subscriptions are widely available across the country. While it primarily rebroadcasts beIN Sports content, the channels have obtained content from other sources, such as Eleven Sports and the U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster Telemundo. The channels have also broadcast anti-Qatar propaganda. The operation, which claims to be backed by Colombian and Cuban investors, has faced international criticism from sports leagues and sanctioning bodies, due to its retransmissions of copyrighted sports content and event coverage that was licensed exclusively to beIN Sports in the MENA region. Preliminary findings by beIN traced beoutQ's feeds to Arabsat satellites (whose frequencies are frequently promoted in beoutQ's advertising), although the provider has consistently denied that it is involved in the operation.\n\nFIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate a deal with beIN (as MENA rightsholder) to sub-license rights to the opening match, final, and all Saudi team matches at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, to a Saudi Arabian broadcaster. However, no deal was reached, and beoutQ ultimately broadcast the entire tournament from various sources, including beIN and the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (who was offering Arabic-language broadcasts). During the World Cup, beIN Sports commentators were accused by Saudi critics, including Turki Al-Sheikh (head of the General Sports Authority), of making on-air comments critical of the country. On 22 June 2018, minister Saud al-Qahtani stated that the Saudi Arabian Football Federation had filed a complaint with FIFA against beIN Sports' monopolization of sports broadcast rights in the MENA region. He also stated that the government had been confiscating beoutQ equipment, and would \"conduct inspection campaigns in coordination with all relevant bodies to prevent any attempt to broadcast any illegal content.\"\n\nFIFA, Ligue 1, the Premier League, and UEFA, have threatened legal actions targeting beoutQ. While it encountered difficulties finding legal representatives in Saudi Arabia due to the lack of diplomatic relationships, beIN has attempted to seek legal action against beoutQ via France and the United States. In August 2018, beIN presented further evidence, in consultation with Cisco Systems, Nagra, and Overon, that the beoutQ feeds originated from Arabsat. The report came after it was revealed that beoutQ had broadcast the entire opening fixture of the 2018–19 Premier League, and most of the opening fixture of the 2018–19 Ligue 1 season.\n\nOn 21 August 2018, beIN Sports was fined US$2.6 million by Saudi Arabia for violations of competition law, including forced bundling of its services with other unrelated channels. beIN responded to the fine by claiming it was politically-motivated, arguing that they were being \"attacked by the Saudi authorities for doing exactly what sports and entertainment broadcasters around the world do, and indeed what other broadcasters active in the Saudi market also do\", and that the actions were \"another illegitimate attempt by Saudi Arabia to drive beIN’s highly successful business from the country, putting politics ahead of the interests of Saudi consumers.

An actor who regularly performs in bit roles, either as a hobby or to earn a living, is referred to as a bit player, a term also used to describe an aspiring actor who has not yet broken into supporting or leading roles.\n\nUnlike extras, who do not typically interact with principals, actors in bit parts are sometimes listed in the credits. An exception to this practice is the cameo appearance, wherein a well-known actor or other celebrity appears in a bit part; it is common for such appearances to be uncredited.\n\nIn MGM's 1951 screen version of the musical \"Show Boat\", the role of the cook Queenie (Frances E. Williams) was reduced from a significant supporting role in the stage version to a bit part in the film. Williams, whose appearance was not intended as a cameo, was not listed at all in the credits. On the other hand, William Warfield, whose role as Joe, Queenie's husband, was also drastically shortened in the film from the stage original, did receive screen credit because he sang \"Ol' Man River\".\n\nBit parts are often significant in the story line and sometimes pivotal, as in Jack Albertson's role as a postal worker in the 1947 feature film \"Miracle on 34th Street\". Some characters with bit parts attract significant attention. Konstantin Stanislavski remarked that \"there are no small parts, only small actors.\"\n\nDabbs Greer, a bit actor, once said, \"Every character actor, in their own little sphere, is the lead.\"\n"}

Its owners have helped to create related cabaret and burlesque shows in other cities. Unrelated businesses have used the phrase \"Crazy Horse\" in their names.\n\nThe Paris Crazy Horse occupies former wine cellars (12 in all which have been knocked together) of an impressive Haussmanian building at 12 Avenue George-V (from the British king George V, in French \"George Cinq\").\n\nAlain Bernardin opened it in 1951 and personally operated it for decades until his death by suicide in 1994. Many of the original waiters (their names stitched in large letters onto the backs of their waistcoats) were also substantial shareholders in the original company. The enterprise remained a family business, in the hands of Bernardin's three children, until 2005, when it changed hands. By this time the name \"Le Crazy Horse de Paris\" was used for the original venue and \"Crazy Horse Paris\" for one in Las Vegas (formerly \"La Femme\") at the MGM Grand.\n\nThe dancers may have been deliberately chosen to be indistinguishable on stage in height and in breast size and shape in the past, but now they have a more diverse group of dancers. All in incredible shape and very skilled. Along with its dancers, the Crazy Horse has also been a popular venue for many other artists, including magicians, jugglers, and mimes. Bernardin explained that he loved magic because it corresponded with his vision: \"[Magic] is a dream. There is no show that is more dreamlike than a magic show. And what we do with the girls is magic, too, because they aren't as beautiful as you see them onstage. It's the magic of lights and costumes. These are my dreams and fascinations that I put onstage.\"\n\nUnder new shareholders and new management from 2005, Crazy Horse started featuring famous or prestigious artists stripping for a limited number of shows, including Dita Von Teese, Carmen Electra, Aria Cascaval, Arielle Dombasle or Pamela Anderson. They also hired Philippe Decouflé as choreographer Kelly Brook appeared in the fall of 2012. Also in 2012, the dancers went on strike for higher pay. Before the strike, which caused the cancellation of a high-profile revue for one day but generated a fantastic buzz for the cabaret, some sources mentioned a salary of €2,000 per month. Other sources said that settlement yielded a 15 percent pay raise. These numbers were denied by the management of the cabaret.\n\nThe Paradiso Girls have named their album Crazy Horse after the club, as one of their members Aria Cascaval worked there. The club is referenced in the song \"Live with Me\" by The Rolling Stones in 1969, and also mentioned in the 1987 Mötley Crüe song \"\"Girls, Girls, Girls\".\"\n\n\n\nOther entertainments with varying degrees of resemblance and similar names, but unaffiliated with the original, include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "348300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=348300", "title": "Digital video recorder", "text": "Digital video recorder\n\nA digital video recorder (DVR) is an electronic device that records video in a digital format to a disk drive, USB flash drive, SD memory card, SSD or other local or networked mass storage device. The term includes set-top boxes with direct to disk recording, portable media players and TV gateways with recording capability, and digital camcorders. Personal computers are often connected to video capture devices and used as DVRs; in such cases the application software used to record video is an integral part of the DVR. Many DVRs are classified as consumer electronic devices; such devices may alternatively be referred to as personal video recorders (PVRs), particularly in Canada.\n\nConsumer digital video recorders ReplayTV and TiVo were launched at the 1999 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Microsoft also demonstrated a unit with DVR capability, but this did not become available until the end of 1999 for full DVR features in Dish Network's DISHplayer receivers. TiVo shipped their first units on March 31, 1999. ReplayTV won the \"Best of Show\" award in the video category with Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen as an early investor and board member, but TiVo was more successful commercially.\n\nLegal action by media companies forced ReplayTV to remove many features such as automatic commercial skip and the sharing of recordings over the Internet, but newer devices have steadily regained these functions while adding complementary abilities, such as recording onto DVDs and programming and remote control facilities using PDAs, networked PCs, and Web browsers.\n\nIn contrast to VCRs, hard-disk based digital video recorders make \"time shifting\" more convenient and also allow for functions such as pausing live TV, instant replay, chasing playback (viewing a recording before it has been completed) and skipping over advertising during playback.\n\nMany DVRs use the MPEG format for compressing the digital video. Video recording capabilities have become an essential part of the modern set-top box, as TV viewers have wanted to take control of their viewing experiences. As consumers have been able to converge increasing amounts of video content on their set-tops, delivered by traditional 'broadcast' cable, satellite and terrestrial as well as IP networks, the ability to capture programming and view it whenever they want has become a must-have function for many consumers.\n\nAt the 1999 CES, Dish Network demonstrated the hardware that would later have DVR capability with the assistance of Microsoft software. which also included WebTV Networks internet TV. By the end of 1999 the Dishplayer had full DVR capabilities and within a year, over 200,000 units were sold.\n\nIn the UK, digital video recorders are often referred to as \"plus boxes\" (such as BSKYB's Sky+ and Virgin Media's V+ which integrates an HD capability, and the subscription free Freesat+ and Freeview+). Freeview+ have been around in the UK since the late 2000s. British Sky Broadcasting markets a popular combined receiver and DVR as Sky+. TiVo launched a UK model in 2000, and is no longer supported, except for third party services, and the continuation of TiVo through Virgin Media in 2010. South African based Africa Satellite TV beamer Multichoice recently launched their DVR which is available on their DStv platform. In addition to ReplayTV and TiVo, there are a number of other suppliers of digital terrestrial (DTT) DVRs, including Thomson, Topfield, Fusion, Pace Micro Technology, Humax, VBox Communications, AC Ryan Playon and Advanced Digital Broadcast (ADB).\n\nMany satellite, cable and IPTV companies are incorporating digital video recording functions into their set-top box, such as with DirecTiVo, DISHPlayer/DishDVR, Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8xxx from Time Warner, Total Home DVR from AT&T U-verse, Motorola DCT6412 from Comcast and others, Moxi Media Center by Digeo (available through Charter, Adelphia, Sunflower, Bend Broadband, and soon Comcast and other cable companies), or Sky+. Astro introduced their DVR system, called Astro MAX, which was the first PVR in Malaysia but was phased out two years after its introduction.\n\nIn the case of digital television, there is no \"encoding\" necessary in the DVR since the signal is already a digitally encoded MPEG stream. The digital video recorder simply stores the digital stream directly to disk. Having the broadcaster involved with, and sometimes subsidizing, the design of the DVR can lead to features such as the ability to use interactive TV on recorded shows, pre-loading of programs, or directly recording encrypted digital streams. It can, however, also force the manufacturer to implement non-skippable advertisements and automatically expiring recordings.\n\nIn the United States, the FCC has ruled that starting on July 1, 2007, consumers will be able to purchase a set-top box from a third-party company, rather than being forced to purchase or rent the set-top box from their cable company. This ruling only applies to \"navigation devices,\" otherwise known as a cable television set-top box, and not to the security functions that control the user's access to the content of the cable operator. The overall net effect on digital video recorders and related technology is unlikely to be substantial as standalone DVRs are currently readily available on the open market.\n\nIn Europe Free-To-Air and Pay TV TV gateways with multiple tuners have whole house recording capabilities allowing recording of TV programs to Network Attached Storage or attached USB storage, recorded programs are then shared across the home network to tablet, smartphone, PC, Mac, Smart TV.\n\nIn 2003 many Satellite and Cable providers introduced dual-tuner digital video recorders. In the UK, BSkyB introduced their first PVR Sky+ with dual tuner support in 2001. These machines have two independent tuners within the same receiver. The main use for this feature is the capability to record a live program while watching another live program simultaneously or to record two programs at the same time, possibly while watching a previously recorded one. Kogan.com introduced a dual-tuner PVR in the Australian market allowing free-to-air television to be recorded on a removable hard drive. Some dual-tuner DVRs also have the ability to output to two separate television sets at the same time. The PVR manufactured by UEC (Durban, South Africa) and used by Multichoice and Scientific Atlanta 8300DVB PVR have the ability to view two programs while recording a third using a triple tuner.\n\nWhere several digital subchannels are transmitted on a single RF channel, some PVRs can record two channels and view a third, so long as all three subchannels are on two channels (or one).\n\nIn the United States, DVRs were used by 32 percent of all TV households in 2009, and 38 percent by 2010, with viewership among 18- to 40-year-olds 40 percent higher in homes that have them.\n\nDVRs are integrated into some television sets (TVs). These systems simplify wiring and operation because they employ a single power cable, have no interconnected ports (e.g., HDMI), and share a common remote control.\n\nVESA-compatible DVRs are designed to attach to the VESA mounting holes (100×100 mm) on the back of an LCD television set (TV), allowing users to combine the TV and DVR into an integrated unit.\n\n\"Over-the-air\" DVRs are standalone set-top-boxes that record broadcast television programs. Several companies have launched over-the-air DVR products for the consumer market over the past few years.\n\nSome pay-TV operators provide set-top boxes that allow subscribers to attach their own network-attached storage (NAS) hard drives or solid-state or flash memory to record video and other media files (e.g., audio and photos).\n\nSoftware and hardware are available which can turn personal computers running Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X into DVRs, and is a popular option for home-theater PC (HTPC) enthusiasts.\n\nThere are many free and open source software DVR applications available for Linux. For example, TV gateway interfaces to DVB tuners and provides network tuner and TV server functions, which allows live viewing and recording over IP networks. Other examples include MythTV, Video Disk Recorder (VDR), LinuxMCE, TiVo, VBox Home TV Gateway, and Kodi (formerly XBMC).\n\nElgato makes a series of digital video recording devices called EyeTV. The software supplied with each device is also called EyeTV, and is available separately for use on compatible third-party tuners from manufacturers such as Pinnacle, TerraTec, and Hauppauge.\n\nSageTV provided DVR software for the Mac but no longer sells it. Previously sold devices support the Hauppauge HVR-950, myTV.PVR and HDHomeRun hardware with its DVR software. SageTV software also included the ability to watch YouTube and other online video with a remote control.\n\nMythTV (see above) also runs under Mac OS X, but most recording devices are currently only supported under Linux. Precompiled binaries are available for the MythTV front-end, allowing a Mac to watch video from (and control) a MythTV server running under Linux.\n\nApple provides applications in the FireWire software developer kit which allow any Mac with a FireWire port to record the MPEG2 transport stream from a FireWire-equipped cable box (for example: Motorola DCT62xx, including HD streams). Applications can also change channels on the cable box via the firewire interface. Only broadcast channels can be recorded as the rest of the channels are encrypted. \"FireRecord (formerly iRecord)\" is a free scheduled-recording program derived from this SDK.\n\nThere are several free digital video recording applications available for Microsoft Windows including GB-PVR, MediaPortal, and Orb (web-based remote interface).\n\nThere are also several commercial applications available including CyberLink, SageTV (which is no longer available after Google acquired it in June 2011), Beyond TV (which is considered discontinued despite an official announcement from SnapStream since the last update was October 2010 and they are concentrating on their enterprise search products), DVBViewer, Showshifter, InterVideo WinDVR, the R5000-HD and Meedio (now a dead product – Yahoo! bought most of the company's technology and discontinued the Meedio line, and rebranded the software Yahoo! Go – TV, which is now a free product but only works in the U.S.). Most TV tuner cards come bundled with software which allows the PC to record television to hard disk. See TV tuner card. For example, Leadtek's WinFast DTV1000 digital TV card comes bundled with the WinFast PVR2 software, which can also record analog video from the card's composite video input socket.\n\nWindows Media Center is a DVR software by Microsoft which was bundled with the Media Center edition of Windows XP, the Home Premium / Ultimate editions of Windows Vista, as well as most editions of Windows 7. When Windows 8 was released in 2012, Windows Media Center was not included with Windows 8 OEM or Retail installations, and was only available as a $15 add-on pack (including DVD Playback codecs) to Windows 8 Pro users.\n\nAn \"embeddable\" DVR is a standalone device that is designed to be easily integrated into more complex systems. It is typically supplied as a compact, bare circuit board that facilitates mounting it as a subsystem component within larger equipment. The control keypad is usually connected with a detachable cable, to allow it to be located on the system's exterior while the DVR circuitry resides inside the equipment.\n\nTelevision and video are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably, but differ in their technical meaning. Video is the visual portion of television, whereas television is the combination of video and audio modulated onto a carrier frequency (i.e., a television channel) for delivery. Most DVRs can record both video and audio.\n\nThe first digital video recorders were designed to record analog television in NTSC, PAL or SECAM formats.\n\nTo record an analog signal a few steps are required. In the case of a television signal, a television tuner must first demodulate the radio frequency signal to produce baseband video. The video is then converted to digital form by a frame grabber, which converts each video image into a collection of numeric values that represent the pixels within the image. At the same time, the audio is also converted to digital form by an analog-to-digital converter running at a constant sampling rate. In many devices, the resulting digital video and audio are compressed before recording to reduce the amount of data that will be recorded, although some DVRs record uncompressed data. When compression is used, video is typically compressed using formats such as H.264 or MPEG-2, and audio is compressed using AAC or MP3.\n\nMany consumer DVRs implement a copy-protection system called \"Copy Generation Management System—Analog\" (CGMS-A), which specifies one of four possible copy permissions by means of two bits encoded in the VBI:\n\nCGMS-A information may be present in analog broadcast TV signals, and is preserved when the signal is recorded and played back by analog VCRs. VCRs do not understand the meanings of the bits but preserve them in case there is a subsequent attempt to copy the tape to a DVR.\n\nDVRs such as TiVo also detect and act upon analog protection systems such as Macrovision and DCS Copy Protection which were originally designed to block copying on analog VCRs.\n\nRecording digital signals is generally a straightforward capture of the binary MPEG data being received. No expensive hardware is required to quantize and compress the signal (as the television broadcaster has already done this in the studio).\n\nDVD-based PVRs available on the market as of 2006 are not capable of capturing the full range of the visual signal available with high definition television (HDTV). This is largely because HDTV standards were finalized at a later time than the standards for DVDs. However, DVD-based PVRs can still be used (albeit at reduced visual quality) with HDTV since currently available HDTV sets also have standard A/V connections.\n\nATSC television broadcasting is primarily used in North America. The ATSC data stream can be directly recorded by a digital video recorder, though many DVRs record only a subset of this information (that can later be transferred to DVD). An ATSC DVR will also act as a set-top box, allowing older televisions or monitors to receive digital television.\n\nThe U.S. FCC attempted to limit the abilities of DVRs with its \"broadcast flag\" regulation. Digital video recorders that had not won prior approval from the FCC for implementing \"effective\" digital rights management would have been banned from interstate commerce from July 2005, but the regulation was struck down on May 6, 2005.\n\nDVB digital television contains audio/visual signals that are broadcast over the air in a digital rather than analog format. The DVB data stream can be directly recorded by the DVR. Autonomous devices (this is, that can be used without a computer/tablet) that can store in an external hard disk drive are called a telememory.\n\nRecording satellite television or digital cable signals on a digital video recorder can be more complex than recording analog signals or broadcast digital signals. There are several different transmission schemes, and the video streams may be encrypted to restrict access to subscribers only.\n\nA satellite or cable set-top box both decrypts the signal if encrypted, and decodes the MPEG stream into an analog signal for viewing on the television. In order to record cable or satellite digital signals the signal must be captured after it has been decrypted but before it is decoded; this is how DVRs built into set-top boxes work.\n\nCable and satellite providers often offer their own digital video recorders along with a service plan. These DVRs have access to the encrypted video stream, and generally enforce the provider's restrictions on copying of material even after recording.\n\nMany DVD-based DVRs have the capability to copy content from a source DVD (ripping). In the United States, this is prohibited under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act if the disc is encrypted. Most such DVRs will therefore not allow recording of video streams from encrypted movie discs.\n\nA digital camcorder combines a camera and a digital video recorder.\n\nSome DVD-based DVRs incorporate connectors that can be used to capture digital video from a camcorder. Some editing of the resulting DVD is usually possible, such as adding chapter points.\n\nSome digital video recorders can now record to solid state flash memory cards (called \"flash camcorders\"). They generally use Secure Digital cards, can include wireless connections (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi), and can play SWF files. There are some digital video recorders that combine video and graphics in real time to the flash card, called DTE or \"direct to edit\". These are used to speed-up the editing workflow in video and television production, since linear videotapes do not then need to be transferred to the edit workstation (see Non-linear editing system).\n\nDVRs can usually record and play H.264, MPEG-4 Part 2, MPEG-2 .mpg, MPEG-2 .TS, VOB and ISO images video, with MP3 and AC3 audio tracks. They can also display images (JPEG and PNG) and play music files (MP3 and Ogg).\n\nSome devices can be updated to play and record in new formats. DVRs usually record in proprietary file systems for copy protection, although some can use FAT file systems. Recordings from standard-definition television usually have 480p/i/576p/i while HDTV is usually in 720p/1080i.\n\nDigital video recorders configured for physical security applications record video signals from closed-circuit television cameras for detection and documentation purposes. Many are designed to record audio as well. DVRs have evolved into devices that are feature rich and provide services that exceed the simple recording of video images that was previously done through VCRs. A DVR CCTV system provides a multitude of advanced functions over VCR technology including video searches by event, time, date and camera. There is also much more control over quality and frame rate allowing disk space usage to be optimized and the DVR can also be set to overwrite the oldest security footage should the disk become full. In some DVR security systems remote access to security footage using a PC can also be achieved by connecting the DVR to a LAN network or the Internet.\nSome of the latest professional digital video recorders include video analytics firmware, to enable functionality such as 'virtual tripwire' or even the detection of abandoned objects on the scene.\n\nSecurity DVRs may be categorized as being either PC-based or embedded. A PC-based DVR's architecture is a classical personal computer with video capture cards designed to capture video images. An embedded type DVR is specifically designed as a digital video recorder with its operating system and application software contained in firmware or read-only memory.\n\nHardware features of security DVRs vary between manufacturers and may include but are not necessarily limited to:\n\nSoftware features vary between manufacturers and may include but are not necessarily limited to:\n\nSome (very few), but certainly not all, digital video recorders which are designed to send information to a service provider over a telephone line or Internet (or any other way) can gather and send real-time data on users' viewing habits.\n\nDigital video recorders are also changing the way television programs advertise products. Watching pre-recorded programs allows users to fast-forward through commercials, and some technology allows users to remove commercials entirely. Half of viewers in the United States, for example, use DVRs to skip commercials entirely. This feature has been controversial for the last decade, with major television networks and movie studios claiming it violates copyright and should be banned.\n\nIn 1985, an employee of Honeywell's Physical Sciences Center, David Rafner, first described a drive-based DVR designed for home TV recording, time-slipping, and commercial skipping. U.S. Patent 4,972,396 focused on a multi-channel design to allow simultaneous independent recording and playback. Broadly anticipating future DVR developments, it describes possible applications such as streaming compression, editing, captioning, multi-channel security monitoring, military sensor platforms, and remotely piloted vehicles.\n\nThe first DVR which had a built-in commercial skipping feature introduced in 1999 by ReplayTV at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. In 2002, five owners of the ReplayTV DVR sued the main television networks and movie studios, asking the federal judge to uphold consumers' rights to record TV shows and skip commercials, claiming that features such as commercial skipping help parents protect their kids from excessive consumerism. ReplayTV was purchased by SONICblue in 2001 and on March 2003, SONICblue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after fighting a copyright infringement suit over the ReplayTV's ability to skip commercials. In 2007, DirecTV purchased the remaining assets of ReplayTV.\nA third-party add-on for Windows Media Center called \"DVRMSToolbox\" has the ability to skip commercials.\nThere is a command-line program called Comskip that detects commercials in an MPEG-2 file and saves their positions to a text file. This file can then be fed to a program like MEncoder to actually remove the commercials.\n\nMany speculate that television advertisements will be eliminated altogether, replaced by advertising in the TV shows themselves. For example, \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\" advertises Sears, Kenmore, Kohler, and Home Depot by specifically using products from these companies, and some sports events like the Sprint Cup of NASCAR are named after sponsors.\n\nAnother type of advertisement shown more and more, mostly for advertising TV shows on the same channel, is where the ad overlays the bottom of the TV screen, blocking out some of the picture. \"Banners\", or \"logo bugs\", as they are called, are referred to by media companies as Secondary Events (2E). This is done in much the same way as severe weather warnings are done. Sometimes, these take up only 5–10% of the screen, but in the extreme, can take up as much as 25% of the viewing area. Some even make noise or move across the screen. One example of this is the 2E ads for \"Three Moons Over Milford\" in the months before its premiere. A video taking up approximately 25% of the bottom-left portion of the screen would show a comet impacting into the moon with an accompanying explosion, during another television program.\n\nBecause of this widely used new technology, advertisers are now looking at a new way to market their products on television. An excerpt from the magazine \"Advertising Age\" reads: \"As advertisers lose the ability to invade the home, and consumer's minds, they will be forced to wait for an invitation. This means that they have to learn what kinds of advertising content customers will actually be willing to seek out and receive.\"\n\nWith ad skipping and the time-sensitive nature of certain ads, advertisers are wary of buying commercial time on shows that are heavily digitally video-recorded. However, technology today makes it possible for networks to insert ads dynamically on videos being played in DVRs. Advertisers could inject time-relevant ads to recorded programs when the program is viewed. This way the ads could be not just topical but also personalized to viewers interests. DirecTV in March 2011 signed an arrangement with NDS Group to enable the delivery of such addressable advertisement.\nIt is believed that viewers prefer to forward ads, than to switch the channel. By switching channels, viewers will have the probability of skipping the beginning of their program. Users might switch to a channel that is also showing ads. Having the ability to pause, rewind, and forward live TV gives users a chance to change the channel fewer times. Forwarding ads can have a later affect on the viewer. Ads that get the viewers' attention will influence the viewers' to rewind and watch what was missed.\n\nIn January 2012, Dish Network announced Hopper service, costing $10 extra per month, which recorded prime-time programming from the four major broadcast networks. With the Auto Hop feature, viewers can watch the programs they choose without commercials, without making the effort to fast-forward. On May 24, 2012, Dish and the networks filed suit in federal court.\n\nOn July 14, 2005, Forgent Networks filed suit against various companies alleging infringement on , entitled \"Computer controlled video system allowing playback during recording\". The listed companies included EchoStar, DirecTV, Charter Communications, Cox Communications, Comcast, Time Warner, and Cable One.\n\nScientific-Atlanta and Motorola, the manufacturers of the equipment sold by the above-mentioned companies, filed a counter-suit against Forgent Networks claiming that their products do not violate the patent, and that the patent is invalid. The two cases were combined into case 6:06-cv-208, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division.\n\nAccording to court documents, on June 20, 2006, Motorola requested that the United States Patent and Trademarks Office reexamine the patent, which was first filed in 1991, but has been amended several times.\n\nOn March 23, 2007, Cablevision Systems Corp lost a legal battle against several Hollywood studios and television networks to introduce a network-based digital video recorder service to its subscribers. However, on August 4, 2008, Cablevision won its appeal. John M. Walker Jr., a Second Circuit judge, declared that the technology \"would not directly infringe\" on the media companies' rights. An appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected.\n\nIn court, the media companies argued that network digital video recorders were tantamount to video-on-demand, and that they should receive license fees for the recording. Cablevision and the appeals court disagreed. The company noted that each user would record programs on his or her own individual server space, making it a DVR that has a \"very long cord.\"\n\nIn 2004, TiVo sued EchoStar Corp, a manufacturer of DVR units, for patent infringement. The parties reached a settlement in 2011 wherein EchoStar pays a one-time fee (in three structured payments) that grants Echostar full rights for life to the disputed TiVo patents upon first payment(as opposed to indefinite and escalating license fees to be constantly renegotiated), and Echostar granted TiVo full rights for life to certain Echostar patents and dropped their counter-suit against TiVo.\n\nIn January 2012, AT&T settled a similar suit brought by TiVo claiming patent infringement (just as with Echostar) in exchange for cash payments to TiVo totaling $215 million through June 2018 plus \"incremental recurring per subscriber monthly license fees\" to TiVo through July 2018, but grants no full lifetime rights as per the Echostar settlement.\n\nIn May 2012, Fox Broadcasting sued Dish Network, arguing that Dish's set-top box with DVR function, which allowed the users to automatically record prime-time programs and skip commercials, was copyright infringement and breach of contract. In July 2013, the 9th circuit rejected Fox's claims.\n\n\n"}

It won the 1966 Hugo Award and the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel, and was later adapted into a 1984 film as well as a 2000 television miniseries. Herbert wrote five sequels, and the first two were presented as a miniseries in 2003. Herbert himself died in 1986.\n\nBrian Herbert and Anderson have also published \"Hunters of Dune\" (2006) and \"Sandworms of Dune\" (2007), sequels to Frank Herbert's final novel \"\" (1985) which complete the chronological progression of his original series and wrap up storylines that began with his \"Heretics of Dune\" (1984).\n\nPrelude to Dune is a prequel trilogy of novels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, set in Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" universe. The series takes place in the years leading up to the events in the original novel \"Dune\" (1965) and explores the origins of some of its characters. In 1997, Bantam Books made a $3 million deal with the authors for three \"Dune\" prequel novels that would come to be known as the \"Prelude to Dune\" trilogy. The novels draw from notes left behind by Frank Herbert after his death in 1986.\n\nThe books in the series are:\n\nAs the \"Prelude to Dune\" series begins, an impatient Crown Prince Shaddam is plotting to end the reign of his father, Padishah Emperor Elrood IX, by any means possible. Young House Atreides heir Leto becomes close with the ruling family of the important technology world Ix, but the ensuing intrigue surrounding a Tleilaxu takeover of Ix makes Leto an enemy in Shaddam. Very close to their goal of producing a Kwisatz Haderach, the Bene Gesserit scheme behind the scenes to secure their influence; the virile Baron Vladimir Harkonnen crosses them and pays a heavy price. Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica and Harkonnen enemies Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck ally themselves with Leto, and Shaddam nearly destroys the all-important planet Arrakis thinking he has found a replacement for its priceless and essential export, melange.\n\n\"Dune: House Atreides\" debuted at #13 on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list, and rose to #12 in its second week of publication. \"Dune: House Harkonnen\" debuted at #11 on the same list, and rose to #8 its second week. The third installment, \"Dune: House Corrino\", debuted at #8 on the \"New York Times\" list.\n\nLegends of Dune is a prequel trilogy of novels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, set in Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" universe. The series takes place over 10,000 years before the events of the 1965 novel \"Dune\", and chronicles the universe-spanning war against thinking machines that would eventually become known as the Butlerian Jihad. It also explores the origins of the families and organizations that populate the distinctive universe in other \"Dune\" works.\n\nThe books in the series are:\n\nThe series explains that after our own time, humanity had become entirely complacent and dependent upon thinking machines; recognizing this weakness, a group of ambitious, militant humans calling themselves the Titans use this widespread reliance on machine intelligence to seize control of the entire universe. The Titans soon make the transition into cyborgs called cymeks; through the use of specialized interfaces, their brains are installed inside giant, mobile, mechanized \"bodies.\" These fearsome, weaponized bodies make the Titans virtually immortal and invincible. Their rule lasts for a century. Then, having mistakenly given one attendant artificial intelligence program too much autonomy, the Titans suddenly find themselves overthrown and enslaved by an AI consciousness calling itself Omnius that seizes control of the entire universe though the interconnected machine network. For over 900 years the Titans live in perpetual servitude to Omnius, cruelly subjugating humanity, quelling human insurrections and secretly plotting their own return to power.\n\nAt the time of the \"Legends of Dune\" series, over 500 planets called the Synchronized Worlds are under complete machine control, their former human populations either enslaved or killed. The relatively few planets of remaining free humans are united under the League of Nobles, a government using what resources it has to defend the League Worlds against machine aggression. A prominent figure in the human rebellion is Serena Butler, the charismatic daughter of the League Viceroy; the murder of her young son at the hands of the independent robot Erasmus finally incites the Butlerian Jihad, with humanity mounting a decisive offense against machine rule. This crusade against the machines lasts for nearly a century, with much loss of human life but ending in human victory at the Battle of Corrin. The Jihad also gives rise to the Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild, the Sardaukar army, the Landsraad, and House Corrino, whose Padishah Emperors rule the universe for the next 10,000 years, until the events of \"Dune\" and the accession of Paul Atreides.\n\n\"Dune: The Butlerian Jihad\" rose to #7 on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list in its second week of publication. \"Dune: The Machine Crusade\" debuted at #7 on the list. The third installment, \"Dune: The Battle of Corrin\", reached #9 on the New York Times list.\n\nHeroes of Dune is a planned tetralogy of novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson set in the \"Dune\" universe created by Frank Herbert. The potential series was initially referred to as \"Paul of Dune\" by the authors as early as 2004.<ref name=\"8/5/06 blog\"></ref> These novels were intended to \"fill in the story\" between Frank Herbert's early \"Dune\" novels.\n\nThe books in the series are:\n\nHalf of the story of \"Paul of Dune\" takes place between Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" (1965) and \"Dune Messiah\" (1969) as Paul's Jihad rages, Shaddam seeks to regain his throne and Princess Irulan accepts the \"task of building the legend of Muad'Dib\". She in turn chronicles Paul's early years (between the 2001 Brian Herbert/Anderson prequel \"\" and \"Dune\"), which feature \"his friendship with Duncan and Gurney and Duke Leto's War of Assassins against Grumman\". \"The Winds of Dune\" (originally announced as \"Jessica of Dune\")<ref name=\"4/23/07 blog\"></ref><ref name=\"4/14/2008 blog\"></ref> chronicles events between Frank Herbert's \"Dune Messiah\" (1969) and \"Children of Dune\" (1976).<ref name=\"11/29/09 blog\"></ref> The final two novels in the series were to be called \"The Throne of Dune\" (formerly \"Irulan of Dune\") and \"Leto of Dune\" (perhaps \"The Golden Path of Dune\"). However, in a July 2010 blog post Anderson announced that these novels had been postponed due to plans by Herbert and Anderson to publish a trilogy (later known as \"Great Schools of Dune\") about \"the formation of the Bene Gesserit, the Mentats, the Suk Doctors, the Spacing Guild and the Navigators, as well as the solidifying of the Corrino imperium.\"<ref name=\"7/15/2010 blog\"></ref>\n\nIn \"Paul of Dune\", Paul Atreides's childhood lessons in the political intrigues of the empire are juxtaposed with his current struggle to secure his control over it. His Fremen armies are spread across the universe in attempt to bring rebel worlds to heel, and Paul avoids one assassination attempt only to nearly die in another. In \"The Winds of Dune\", Paul's disappearance into the desert has left a power vacuum, and his closest advisors struggle to determine what path his empire should take.\n\n\"The Winds of Dune\" rose to #15 on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list in its second week of publication.\n\nGreat Schools of Dune is a prequel trilogy of novels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, set in Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" universe. A sequel to the \"Legends of Dune\" trilogy (2002-2004), the series takes place nearly a century after the events of Brian Herbert and Anderson's \"\" (2004), in which the Army of Humanity finally defeats the thinking machine armies of Omnius. Now, the fledgling Bene Gesserit, Mentat and Suk Schools, as well as the Spacing Guild, are threatened by the independent anti-technology forces gaining power in the aftermath of the Butlerian Jihad. The \"Great Schools of Dune\" trilogy, first discussed by Anderson in a 2009 interview and later named by him in a 2010 blog post, chronicles the early years of these organizations, which figure prominently in the original \"Dune\" novels. Though the third and final novel was originally identified by Anderson as \"The Swordmasters of Dune\" in 2009, in 2014 Brian Herbert and Anderson confirmed that its title would be \"Navigators of Dune\". On July 27, 2015, Anderson previewed the cover of \"Navigators of Dune\" on Twitter and noted its 2016 release.\n\nThe books in the series are:\n\nIn \"Sisterhood of Dune\", the anti-technology Butlerian movement is gaining momentum under the leadership of the popular Manford Torondo. He and his forces are scouring the universe to cleanse humanity of its reliance on convenient technologies, destroying any machinery they can find. Torondo's growing power threatens the Corrino Emperor Salvador, as well as the Sisterhood on Rossak and the Mentat School on Lampadas, each of which harbors secret technology. Space travel tycoon Josef Venport also plots to salvage machinery which he believes can be useful in his business empire. \"Mentats of Dune\" finds Gilbertus Albans carefully managing his Mentat School under the watchful eye of the fanatical Butlerians, while Raquella Berto-Anirul seeks to rebuild her own Sisterhood School on Wallach IX. To secure his control of interstellar commerce and strike a blow against the Butlerians, Venport places a trade embargo on any planet which embraces Torondo's movement.\n\n\"Sisterhood of Dune\" debuted at #23 on \"The New York Times\" Hardcover Fiction Best-Seller List, and \"Mentats of Dune\" was released at #17 on the same list. \"Publishers Weekly\" called \"Sisterhood\" a \"shallow but fun blend of space opera and dynastic soap opera.\"\n"}

{"id": "8526396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8526396", "title": "Golden Age of Porn", "text": "Golden Age of Porn\n\nThe Golden Age of Porn, or porno chic, refers to a 15-year period (around 1969–1984) in commercial American pornography, which spread internationally, in which sexually explicit films experienced positive attention from mainstream cinemas, movie critics, and the general public. It began with release of the 1969 film \"Blue Movie\" directed by Andy Warhol, and the 1970 film \"Mona\" produced by Bill Osco. These films were the first adult erotic films depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. Both influenced the making of films such as 1972's \"Deep Throat\" starring Linda Lovelace and directed by Gerard Damiano, \"Behind the Green Door\" starring Marilyn Chambers and directed by the Mitchell brothers, 1973's \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" also by Damiano, and 1976's \"The Opening of Misty Beethoven\" by Radley Metzger.\n\nFollowing mentions by Johnny Carson on his popular \"Tonight Show\" and Bob Hope on TV as well, \"Deep Throat\" achieved major box-office success, despite being rudimentary by mainstream standards. In 1973, the more accomplished, but still low-budget, film \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" was the seventh most successful film of the year, and was well received by major media, including a favorable review by film critic Roger Ebert. The phenomenon of porn being publicly discussed by celebrities, and taken seriously by critics, a development referred to, by Ralph Blumenthal of \"The New York Times\", as \"porno chic\", began for the first time in modern American culture. It became obvious that box-office returns of very low-budget adult erotic films could fund further advances in the technical and production values of porn, making it extremely competitive with Hollywood films. There was concern that, left unchecked, the vast profitability of such films would lead to Hollywood being influenced by pornography.\n\nPrior to this, thousands of U.S. state and municipal anti-obscenity laws and ordinances held that participating in the creation, distribution, or consumption of pornography constituted criminal action. Multi-jurisdictional interpretations of obscenity made such films highly susceptible to prosecution and criminal liability for obscenity, thereby greatly restricting their distribution and profit potential. However, the US Supreme Court's 1973 decision in \"Miller v. California\", narrowing and simplifying the definition of obscenity, resulted in dramatically fewer prosecutions nationwide. Freedom in creative license, higher movie budgets and payouts, and a \"Hollywood mindset\", all contributed to this period.\n\nHowever, with the increasing availability of videocassette recorders for private viewing in the 1980s, video supplanted film as the preferred distribution medium for pornography, which quickly reverted to being low-budget and openly gratuitous, ending this \"Golden Age\".\n\nPornographic films were produced in the early 20th century as \"stag\" movies, intended to be viewed at male gatherings or in brothels. In the United States, social disapproval was so great that men in them sometimes attempted to conceal their face by subterfuge, such as a false mustache (used in \"A Free Ride\") or even being masked. Very few people were ever identified as appearing in such films; and performers were often presumed to have been prostitutes or criminals. Vincent Drucci is said to have performed in a pornographic film made in 1924. Candy Barr, who appeared in the 1950s \"Smart Alec\", was virtually unique among those appearing in stag films, having attained a degree of celebrity through her participation.\n\nIn the US, during the late 1960s, there was regular semi-underground production of pornographic films on a modest scale. After answering New York City newspaper advertisements for nude models, Eric Edwards and Jamie Gillis, among others, appeared in these films, which were silent black and white 'loops' of low quality, often intended for peep booth viewing in the proliferation of adult video arcades around Times Square. The product of the New York City porn industry was distributed nationwide by underworld figure Robert DiBernardo, who commissioned the production of much of the so-called 'Golden Age' era films made in New York City. Although not the first adult film to obtain a wide theatrical release in the US, none had achieved a mass audience, and changed public attitude toward pornography, as \"Deep Throat\" did.\n\n\"Blue Movie\" by Andy Warhol, released in 1969, and, more freely, \"Mona\", by Bill Osco, released in 1970, were the first films depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical distribution in the United States. Although \"Blue Movie\" involved sexual intercourse, the film, starring Viva and Louis Waldon, included substantial dialogue about the Vietnam War and various mundane tasks. Besides being a seminal film in the 'Golden Age of Porn', \"Blue Movie\", according to Warhol, was a major influence in the making of \"Last Tango in Paris\" (1972), an internationally controversial erotic drama film, starring Marlon Brando, and released a few years after \"Blue Movie\" was made.\n\nThe film \"Mona\" differed from \"Blue Movie\" by presenting more of a story plot: Mona (played by Fifi Watson) had promised her mother that she would remain a virgin until her impending marriage. Later, in December 1971, the film \"Boys in the Sand\", one of the first adult erotic films, after \"Blue Movie\" in 1969, to be reviewed by \"Variety\" magazine, was released and opened in theaters across the United States and around the world. The film's title is a parodic reference to the 1968 play by Mart Crowley, and the related 1970 film adaptation, \"The Boys in the Band\".\n\nThe 'Golden Age of Porn' continued in 1972 with \"Deep Throat\". It officially premiered at the World Theater in New York City on June 12, 1972 and was advertised in \"The New York Times\" under the bowdlerized title \"Throat\". After Johnny Carson talked about the film on his nationally top-rated TV show and Bob Hope, as well, mentioned it on TV, \"Deep Throat\" became very profitable and a box-office success, according to one of the figures behind the film. In its second year of release, \"Deep Throat\" just missed \"Variety's\" top 10. However, by then, it was often being shown in a double bill with the most successful of the top three adult erotic films released in the 1972–1973 era, \"The Devil in Miss Jones\", which easily outperformed \"Deep Throat\", while leaving \"Behind the Green Door\" trailing in third place.\n\nThe 1973 film \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" was ranked number seven in the \"Variety \" list of the top ten highest-grossing pictures of 1973, despite lacking the wide release and professional marketing of Hollywood and having been virtually banned across the country for half the year (see Miller v. California, below). Some critics have described the film as, along with \"Deep Throat\", one of the \"two best erotic motion pictures ever made\". William Friedkin called \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" a \"great film\", partly because it was one of the few adult erotic films with a proper storyline. Roger Ebert referred to \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" as the \"best\" of the genre he had seen and gave it three-stars (of four). Ebert also suggested the film's box office receipts were inflated as a way of laundering the profits from illegal activities, although such a method would have required organised crime to be paying taxes on their illegally obtained income.\n\n\"The Devil in Miss Jones\" was one of the first films to be inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame. The sound-recording, cinematography, and story-line of \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" were of a considerably higher quality than any previous porn film. The lead, Georgina Spelvin, who had been in the original Broadway run of \"The Pajama Game\", combined vigorous sex with an acting performance some thought as convincing as anything to be seen in a good mainstream production. She had been hired as a caterer, but Gerard Damiano, the film director, was impressed with her reading of Miss Jones's dialogue, while auditioning an actor for the non-sex role of 'Abaca'. According to \"Variety's \" review, \"With \"The Devil in Miss Jones\", the hard-core porno feature approaches an art form, one that critics may have a tough time ignoring in the future\". The review also described the plot as comparable to Jean-Paul Sartre's play \"No Exit\", and went on to describe the opening scene as, \"a sequence so effective it would stand out in any legit theatrical feature.\" It finished by stating, \"Booking a film of this technical quality into a standard sex house is tantamount to throwing it on the trash heap of most current hard-core fare.\" \n\nAn influential five-page article in \"The New York Times Magazine\" in 1973 described the phenomenon of porn being publicly discussed by celebrities, and taken seriously by critics, a development referred to, by Ralph Blumenthal of \"The New York Times\", as \"porno chic\". Some expressed the opinion that pornographic films would continue to extend their access to US theaters, and the mainstream film industry would gravitate toward the influence of porn.\n\nSupreme Court's 1973 \"Miller v. California\" decision redefined obscenity from \"utterly without socially redeeming value\" to lacks \"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\". Crucially, it made 'contemporary community standards' the criterion, holding that obscenity was not protected by the First Amendment; the ruling gave leeway to local judges to seize and destroy prints of films adjudged to violate local community standards. The Miller decision stymied porn distribution.\n\"The Devil in Miss Jones\", as well as \"Deep Throat\" and \"Behind the Green Door\", was prosecuted successfully during the latter half of 1973; the Supreme Court's Miller decision closed much of America to the exhibition of adult erotic films, and often led to it being banned outright. Porn films would never again feature so prominently in the mainstream movie business, until the emergence of the internet in the 1990s.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision to have put mass box office returns beyond the reach of pornographic films, the leaps in the films' quality that had occurred between 1972 and 1973 were not sustained. With their relatively modest financial means, a predicted move of organized crime into Hollywood failed to materialize. Pornographic films continued to be a highly profitable business, and thrived throughout the rest of the 1970s, leading to the concept of porn \"stars\" gaining currency. Ostracism of porn performers meant they almost invariably used pseudonyms. Being outed as having appeared in porn usually put an end to an actor's hope of a mainstream career. An indication of the returns still possible was that a 1976 release, \"Alice in Wonderland: An X-Rated Musical Comedy\", favorably reviewed by film critic Roger Ebert in 1976, reportedly grossed over $90 million globally. Some historians assess \"The Opening of Misty Beethoven\", based on the play \"Pygmalion\" by George Bernard Shaw (and its derivative, \"My Fair Lady\"), and directed by Radley Metzger, as attaining a mainstream level in storyline and sets. Author Toni Bentley called the film the \"crown jewel\" of the Golden Age.\n\nIn general, after 1973, adult erotic films emulated mainstream filmmaking storylines and conventions, merely to frame the depictions of sexual activity to prepare an 'artistic merit' defense against possible obscenity charges. The adult film industry remained stuck at the level of 'one day wonders', finished by participants hired for only a single day. The ponderous technology of the time meant filming a simple scene would often take hours due to the need for the camera to be laboriously set up for each shot. Repeated sustained performances might be required on cue at any time over the course of a day, which was an issue for men without the recourse to modern Viagra-type drugs. Production was concentrated in New York City where organized crime was widely believed to have control over all aspects of the business, and to prevent entry of competitors. Although their budgets were usually very low, a subcultural level of appreciation exists for films of this era, which were produced by a core group of around thirty performers, some of whom had other jobs. Several were actors who could handle dialogue when required. However, some participants scoffed at the idea that what they did, qualified as \"acting\". By the early 1980s, the rise of home video had led to the end of the era when people went to movie theaters to see sex shot on 35mm film with production values, ultimately culminating with the rise of the internet in the 1990s and beyond.\n\nThe 'Golden Age' was a period of interactions between pornography and the contemporaneous second wave of feminism. Radical and cultural feminists, along with religious and conservative groups, attacked pornography, while other feminists were pro-pornography, such as Camille Paglia, who defined what came to be known as sex-positive feminism in her work, \"Sexual Personae\". Paglia and other sex-positive or pro-pornography feminists accepted porn as part of the sexual revolution with its libertarian sexual themes, such as exploring bisexuality and swinging, free from government interference. The endorsement of female critics was essential for the credibility of the brief era of \"porno chic\".\n\nMajor pornographic film actors of the first part of the 'Golden Age', the \"porno chic\" era, included:\nAt the time of the maturation of the second wave, movies increasingly were being shot on video for home release.\n\nAs their popularity rose, so did their control of their careers. John Holmes became the first recurring porn character in the \"Johnny Wadd\" film series directed by Bob Chinn. Lisa De Leeuw was one of the first to sign an exclusive contract with a major adult production company, Vivid Video, and Marilyn Chambers worked in mainstream movies, being one of the first of a rare number of crossover porn actors.\n\nMajor producers during the first wave of the 'Golden Age', the \"Porno Chic\" era, include:\n\nWith the rise of video, the dominant pornographic film studios of the Second Wave period were VCA Pictures and Caballero Home Video.\n\nSome of the best-known adult erotic films of the period include:\n\n\n"}

In response of the bell, the teacher is flung about by the excited students entering the school. The children to sing \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\", which was a \"de facto\" anthem for America at that time. After the singing, an animal gives the teacher an apple, before taking it back and eating it when the teacher wasn't looking. Rita then plays a piano, and Milton sings a song. However, he forgets the words and begins to sing phrases of nonsense. After the performance, the teacher asks a mouse (named Willie Jones) in the class if he has written his composition yet. Jones says no, but he can whistle \"the theme song\". He then brings out a flute and starts to play. The other animals join in, using both themselves and various items as instruments. These include a goat using his dunce cap as a trumpet, the elephant using his trunk as a trombone, and several duck's using their beaks as a xylophone. Due to the music, the schoolhouse comically dances. As a result of the dancing, the building collapses and all the animals run out of it.\n\nThe film ends with a moral, which is unrelated to the preceding film and portrayed as a cartoon featuring a man and a girl. The man states that \"A Powdered Nose is No Guarantee of a Clean Neck.\" This angers the lady, who trips him up with her foot and hits him in the head with her purse.\n\n\"Good Old Schooldays\" received mixed reviews in the cinema review magazines at that time. The cartoon was featured as <nowiki>\"Okay\"</nowiki> by the \"Motion Picture News\". The magazine said that whilst \"This release has sufficient merriment to tickle the sides of the crabbish\", the magazine criticised the lack of amusing gags and the magazine's closing note for the cartoon was that it was \"Okay for a heavy feature\". The cartoon was viewed more favorable by \"The Film Daily\", who said the film was a \"highly amusing filler\". \n"}

{"id": "43577855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43577855", "title": "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice", "text": "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\n\nHellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is a dark fantasy action-adventure game developed and published by the British video game development studio Ninja Theory. Self-described as an \"independent AAA game\", it was created by a team of approximately twenty developers led by writer and director Tameem Antoniades. It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in August 2017, with an Xbox One version in April 2018. The game features support for virtual reality, which was added in an update in 2018. \n\nInspired by Norse mythology and Celtic culture, \"Hellblade\" follows Senua, a Pict warrior who must make her way to Helheim by defeating otherworldly entities and facing their challenges, in order to rescue the soul of her dead lover from the goddess Hela. In parallel, the game acts as a metaphor for the character's struggle with psychosis, as Senua, who suffers from the condition but believes it to be a curse, is haunted by an entity known as the \"Darkness\", voices in her head known as \"Furies\", and memories from her past. To properly represent psychosis, developers worked closely with neuroscientists, mental health specialists, and people suffering from the condition.\n\nThe game blends several genres, including hack and slash, puzzle solving, and psychological horror. Voice acting is an integral part of the game, while its cutscenes combine motion capture by Melina Juergens, and live action performances by other actors. \"Hellblade\" was a commercial success and was well received by critics, who praised it as a work of art and applauded its uncommon choice of revolving around psychosis, the quality and uniqueness of its approach of the condition, and its story and main character. Its overall presentation, along with Juergens' performance, were also considered superior in quality to what independent games usually provide, although its gameplay and other elements received some criticism. The game sold over a million copies across all platforms by June 2018.\n\n\"Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\" is divided in two types of gameplay: the first allows Senua to walk freely and interact with her surroundings. Those parts focus on either story via voiceover, as Senua travels from one location to another, or the resolution of a puzzle or challenge of some kind to progress further. She can use a capacity known as \"focus\", in reference to her tendency to see things differently from other people due to her condition, to trigger puzzle-related events. If she uses her focus on totems hidden throughout the game, it triggers a memory via voice-over of her friend Druth telling her of the stories of the Norsemen; activating all forty-four of them triggers a bonus cutscene shortly before the game's climax, that extends on Druth's backstory. Several areas feature their own exclusive mechanics or trials, such as reaching a safe zone in time before Senua dies, or using the focus ability to modify the structure of her surroundings.\n\nIn addition, \"Hellblade\" features fights against malformed representations of Northmen who block her progression, including occasional bosses. During those fights, Senua has her sword drawn out, and is turned towards one of her enemies, on which the camera is automatically focused; she can use two kind of attacks, quick or heavy, kick an enemy to prevent it from blocking her attacks, parry, or dodge. She can also charge the opponent she is currently focusing on, to either get closer or directly attack or kick it. If she parries or dodges enough, she can use her focus ability in battle to move faster than her enemies or dissipate the shadows some of them are made of, which makes them impervious to regular attacks. Once she obtains Gramr, Senua can charge her heavy attacks for additional damage and parries more efficiently, both of which can allow her to use her focus ability. If Senua suffers a strong hit, or several hits in a row, she falls to the ground, and the player must press the corresponding button repeatedly as fast as possible before an enemy deals her a fatal blow; if she does not get back up in time, she dies. The closer she is to death, the harder it is for her to get back up; she can also die from a regular hit, if she was already very close to death.\n\n\"Hellblade\" does not feature any HUD or tutorials. Instead, Druth, Furies, or the Darkness, provide audio indications on game mechanics, and how to progress through levels and puzzles. The Furies also provide Senua advice in battle, notably warning her if an enemy is attacking from her back. They react when Senua takes damage, and panic heavily if she is close to death: how nervous they are when she takes a hit is representative of how much damage she can still take. The nature of most apparitions, events witnessed, or voices heard, is purposely left unclear, and can be interpreted as either an actual apparition by a spirit, a memory of Senua, or a trick created by the Darkness or one of the deceptive creatures she has to face. As such, the clues given during the game are not always reliable, except for Druth's: certain Furies try to demotivate Senua, or give false indications such as telling her she took the wrong way, or that she is walking into a trap. Another core mechanic is the possibility of permadeath, which is meant to delete the player's save data after they surpass a number of deaths.\n\nSet in the late 8th century, the game starts with Senua (Melina Juergens), a Pict warrior from Orkney arriving at the border of Helheim in a quest to save the soul of her dead lover, Dillion (Oliver Walker), from the goddess Hela. Senua believes she suffers from a curse, and hears \"Furies\", voices in her head commenting her every actions, notably one, the Narrator (Chipo Chung), who is aware of the player's presence and talks to them. She is also followed by the Darkness (Steven Hartley), a dark entity at the core of the curse. She carries Dillion's severed head to use it as a vessel to his soul, and is also guided by her memories of the stories of Druth (Nicholas Boulton), a former slave of the Norsemen well versed in their legends, now deceased, who became her friend and mentor during a year-long self-imposed exile. To enter Helheim, Senua defeats both the fire giant Surt and the spirit of illusions Valravn, but as she crosses the bridge to Helheim, is attacked by Hela, who defeats her with a single blow, shattering her sword. Barely surviving the encounter, she follows visions of Druth and a man-shaped light she believes to be Dillion to a great tree where she faces four challenges linked to her past, and is rewarded with the legendary sword Gramr, strong enough to kill gods.\n\nMeanwhile, Senua's backstory is unveiled through her hallucinations, revealing that her mother Galena (Ellie Piercy) suffered the same curse she did, but did not believe it to be dreadful. However, Senua's devoutly religious father Zynbel (also performed by Hartley) did, and burned Galena alive. Senua witnessed the event at age five, which caused her psychosis to worsen significantly and led her to convince herself her mother died willingly. Her father, convincing her that her condition was a curse, abused Senua emotionally and physically and isolated her from the rest of the world until she met Dillion when he visited her village. The two fell in love, and Senua left her father to be with him, as he saw her as different and misunderstood instead of cursed. However, after a plague killed many in Dillion's village, Senua, believing the fault to be hers, left in exile. When she returned a year later having hopefully left the Darkness behind, she found everyone killed by Norsemen who had invaded, sacrificing Dillion in a blood eagle to their gods. Remembering the stories of Druth, Senua departed on her journey to save Dillion's soul from the gods of the Norsemen.\n\nUltimately, Senua fights against the influence of the Darkness and defeats the beast Garm. She then realizes the Darkness is a representation of her father's abuse and beliefs, and frees herself from the Furies. Soon after, she faces a legion of Hela's warriors in a hopeless fight, and is killed. In her final moments, she recalls Dillion telling her of the importance of the acceptance of loss. As the imagery of Helheim fades away, Hela drops Dillion's head into the abyss, but as the camera returns to her, Senua is standing in her place, with a dead Hela in place of Senua's body. Having accepted that it was never possible to bring her lover back, and that she is not responsible for his death or anyone else's, Senua frees herself from the Darkness' influence, and accepts the Furies not as a curse, but a part of who she is. She invites the player to follow her, while the Narrator says her goodbyes to the player.\n\n\"Hellblade\" was announced for the PlayStation 4 at Sony's Gamescom media briefing on August 12, 2014, where a trailer was shown. In a joint statement, Ninja Theory described the game as \"an experience focused on delivering a deep character in a twisted world, with brutal uncompromising combat\", and stated that they wanted to \"make a smaller, more focused game experience that is uncompromising in its combat, art and story\". The developers called it an \"independent AAA game\", with their goal being to make a game with all the qualities and production values of any AAA game on the market, but with creative freedom and an \"indie spirit\". The team eventually succeeded in releasing the game independently, but to achieve this could only release it via digital distribution.\n\nHugues Giboire, art director of previous Ninja Theory game \"Heavenly Sword\", returned to work on the game. A Microsoft Windows version of the game was announced on January 9, 2015. The game is powered by Unreal Engine 4, and was made by Ninja Theory with a team of around twenty developers. Its subtitle, \"Senua's Sacrifice\", was announced in March 2016. \"Hellblade: Senua's Psychosis\", a short documentary film included with the game, details the concept behind its story and inspirations, notably the team's study of mental illness. It was written and narrated by Antoniades, and edited by Juergens.\n\nThe main inspiration of Senua's character was the Iceni queen Boudica, while her name came from Senuna, a Celtic goddess long lost to historians but re-discovered in 2002, whose name was at first read incorrectly as Senua. Based on what is believed of the way Celtic warriors looked, Senua was given war paints, and braided hair clumped with lime. Doing research to find the right angle for the character, the team found out that in the 8th century, the Roman Empire had conquered almost all of Europe, but were unable to conquer a group of Celts in the northern reaches of Great Britain known as the Picts. Towards the end of the century, the first Vikings arrived in the lands of the Picts, more specifically the islands of Orkney, and quickly replaced them as the main population of the land. Based on the belief that the Norsemen were known for sacrificing the leaders of the tribes they had conquered to their gods, the game's director and lead writer Tameem Antoniades decided to use this as the basis for Senua's quest and trauma, and to have her find everyone in her village killed by the Norsemen and her lover sacrificed to Norse gods via the blood eagle, a ritualized method of execution whose authenticity is actually debated among historians.\n\nAccording to Antoniades, the team, researching Celtic culture and the Celts' views on mental disorder, found out that they used the term \"gelt\" for a man or woman who had been driven mad by a curse, grief, or the trauma of a battle, and that the gelt would take to a life in the woods in search of penance, punishment and purgatory; the team decided to make Senua a gelt, who had left her home in exile for those reasons. The character of Druth was based on both a real Irish Celt named Findan who was enslaved by the Norsemen in the 8th century, but eventually escaped and became a monk, and the Celtic tale of \"a mad sinner who flees battle into exile and takes on a beastly nature, growing feathers on his body\". The character was given a backstory similar to Findan's, a cloak featuring feathers, and was named after another word used by the Celts to describe mental disorder, \"druth\", meaning \"fool\" or \"one who utters the words of gods\".\n\nAntoniades and his team initially conceptualized \"Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\" as \"a compelling, adult, fantasy game\". The game was always supposed to be hinted as taking place in Senua's mind, but with her mental illness originally less central to the story. However, the team came to see it as an opportunity to raise awareness on psychosis; regarding the team's interest with the condition, Antoniades stated \"It is easy to see the pain and suffering caused by physical diseases or physical trauma, it is not so easy to see the mental suffering or trauma or severe mental illness. But what if we could find a way to see it ? Games are capable of drawing you in for hours on end, playing the role of a character who's different from you, experiencing their perspective, and actively involving you in a world that functions with a different set of rules. [...] There are many things that happen in the world of \"Hellblade\" that make perfect sense within the context of Senua's mind. [...] To complete Senua's quest, you have to internalize and accept the logic and meaning behind these things to progress\"; he notably felt that using the tendency of certain psychotics to see patterns others would not see or notice as a game mechanic to solve puzzles would provide a unique angle impossible in media other than video games.\n\nAntoniades admitted that during his research, he \"didn't have to look very far to discover my own ignorance of the subject\". To portray psychosis properly, Ninja Theory \"consulted world-leading neuroscientists and non-profit organizations like Wellcome Trust to properly capture the experience of psychosis and its devastating effects on the human mind\". Antoniades \"learnt that people can experience hallucinations and delusional beliefs without it being a problem – the illness comes when those experiences cause suffering. Often the recovery is not about curing yourself of hallucinations, but finding ways to live with them. That was a revelation to me\".\n\nExperts who worked closely with the team include Professor Paul Fletcher from the University of Cambridge, and writer and psychologist Professor Charles Fernyhough from the University of Durham, an expert on voice hearing. Ninja Theory received funding for the game from the Wellcome Trust, who also helped them creatively in their depiction of mental illness, notably by helping them to get in contact with people suffering from it. They also worked with a \"recovery college\", an establishment which acts as both a health facility, and a college for its patients. Antoniades was marked by the story of \"a girl who has to live with an angry voice screaming at her, slamming on her doors and walls 24 hours a day. That's someone who would often see corpses hanging in the room, so real that they would sometimes try to rescue them\"; this inspired several events featured in the game as well.\n\nWhen working with experts, the team realized that \"quite often, the illness comes not from the symptoms, but from the stigma, isolation, and mistreatment that comes about from the rest of society\". This led the team to make Senua's father and the way he abused and isolated her during her youth the real nature of the Darkness which haunts her. To create the voices heard by Senua, the team \"worked closely with a group of voice-hearers to try and get these sounding as realistic as possible\"; Senua's visual hallucinations, including her flashbacks, or the way several elements of a level appear brighter than they should be, were also based on descriptions from people suffering from delusions. In June 2017, the team presented the near-finished game to several of the people suffering from mental illness they had collaborated with, as a way to see if the final result had \"reflected their views or if it had misrepresented them\".\n\nSenua's voice acting and motion capturing were performed by German freelance photographer and video editor Melina Juergens, who had never done either of those things prior to \"Hellblade\". She was used by the team as a stand-in for Senua for several months while they perfected their motion capture techniques, and they eventually came to the conclusion that she could play the character in the finalized game. Game director and lead writer Tameem Antoniades stated that he knew her well enough to know that he did not have to teach her how to act, but to \"relive her own internal pain\". All cutscenes feature Juergens' vocal performance as she recorded it during the filming of her physical performance with motion capture suit and markers, rather than before or afterwards during a voice acting session. In addition to the camera placed in front of Juergens' face to capture her expressions for her animated counterpart, Antoniades used a portable camera to film the scenes as they appear in the final game. As they only had one camera, the team opted to make all the cutscenes be presented as one single long take, the objective being to make the viewer feel like \"an observer, like a presence watching Senua throughout\".\n\nOperating on a much smaller budget with \"Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\" than their previous games, Ninja Theory went out of their usual ways to film the cut scenes of the game. Instead of going to bigger studios and having a team of approximately 20 people film several actors together, like they did in the past, they filmed only Juergens in a small space, with only three other people needed on set: Antoniades directing and filming, one person to look after the audio, and one person to look after the motion capture process. To save more money, the team used equipment described by Antoniades as \"fairly cheap\", including material bought at a low price at IKEA and on Amazon. As a further cost-saving measure, they used their own boardroom for the motion capture scenes, rather than using external motion capture studio spaces.\n\nThe helmet capturing Juergens' expressions and voice was provided to the team by Technoprops. The team opted to feature only two cameras on the helmet, as they felt that having four would be too uncomfortable for Juergens and impact her performance. The audio recording device was the most expensive part of the setup, and was placed around Juergens' forehead to avoid recording breathing sounds. Because all of Juergens' audio was recorded live, the team could not give her indications or reminders directly, or play music she would synchronize her performance with. For this reason, pre-recorded audio notes by Antoniades and excerpts from the soundtrack would be played at the same time on headphones both he and Juergens would wear, so they could act accordingly and in synchronization with each other.\n\nTo feature the voices in Senua's head in a way that would be realistic regarding actual people suffering auditory hallucinations, the team, based on descriptions by Professor Charles Fernyhough, an expert on the subject, recorded several actors using binaural recording that also records the 3D position of sound, so the voices would sound as close or distant as the actors were to the microphone, replicating the way human ears perceive sounds. The team then invited voice hearers to listen to the result in order to give them feedback for future recordings. The original score for the game was composed by David García and Andy LaPlegua; the song \"Just Like Sleep\" by Passarella Death Squad is played during the final battle, and the song \"Illusion\" by VNV Nation plays during the ending credits.\n\n\"Hellblade\" was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 via digital channels only on August 8, 2017. Following the period of timed console exclusivity for the PlayStation 4, A version for the Xbox One, with enhanced graphical support on the Xbox One X, was released on April 11, 2018. On July 31, 2018, an update added full virtual reality support via the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift headsets.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. Its choice to depict and revolve around psychosis was applauded as a unique and interesting choice, as was the execution of those themes, and the idea of blending its approach with Norse mythology and the grief-ridden journey of Senua. Juergens' performance, and the game's sound, artistic direction, tense atmosphere, and low price, were also praised; the quality of its production value and graphics was singled out as superior to what independent games usually offer. Reception of the combats and puzzles were more mixed, with several reviewers complaining about combat being too repetitive and simplistic, the lack of variety in the enemies, and about the puzzles being redundant.\n\nBrandin Tyrrel of IGN praised the story, sound, directing, art direction, voice acting, music, and innovative presentation, and stating \"it unfolds like a beautiful, dark, tense visual novel, placing the excellently raw, human performance of its main character front and center on her journey into the land of the Northmen. Her story is one of confusion, sadness, fear, and loss, and it’s punctuated by moments of beauty, and strength that has left a lasting impression on me.\" He added \"As impressive as [\"Hellblade's\"] story is, Ninja Theory’s smart design reinforces the sensory nature of the harrowing tale through subtle and intuitive mechanics [...] Its incredibly smart use of audio and visual distortion and trickery to convey the frightening effects of psychosis, hallucinations, and delusion, are married with the gameplay elements for an experience that rarely ever grapples over whether it’s a game or a story\". Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb stated as a narrative effort, its success was \"almost unparalleled in the medium\". He applauded the story, sound, characters, graphics, Juergens' performance and \"piercing intensity\". He appreciated the less artistic elements, but felt that the gameplay for battles was \"usually satisfying but can also feel like a chore in confined spaces\". However, the described the boss fights as \"all unique and exceptionally memorable\". Alice Bell of \"VideoGamer.com\" gave the game a 9 out of 10, praising its \"incredibly compelling story\", \"fast, stylish combat\", and \"beautiful and horrible audio and visual design\".\n\nIn a positive review, Leif Johnson of \"PC Gamer\" praised \"Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\" for its themes, presentation and story, but complained that the \"inspiration doesn't carry over to the actual fights. [...] I frankly found it kind of dull in the one-on-one duels at the start, and it didn't help that the enemies sometimes seem to skip a few animations when reacting to attacks. Nor does it help that there's precious little variation in the foes themselves, who almost always show up as tall, shirtless warriors with deer-skull helmets or as beefy berserker shamans. By the end of the first hour, you've basically seen every non-boss you're going to see\". He did, however, consider combat to get much better once Senua has to face many enemies at once. In one of the rare publications to give the game a somewhat negative review, \"Edge\" was unhappy with the game's depiction of Senua's condition.\n\nSeveral reviewers were less enthusiastic, with most criticism directed at the gameplay, fights and puzzles; however, most of them still praised \"Hellblade\" as a work of art. Among those were \"Game Informer\"s review, who found \"Hellblade\" to be \"undeniably memorable, telling a compelling tale that explores subject matter many consider taboo\". However, he believed that the gameplay suffered from the game's themes. Unaware of the fake nature of the game's supposed permadeath, he complained that it was too unclear how close to a permanent game over he was, and felt the sense that he was in \"frustrating\". He also found the puzzles tedious, and believed that the idea of the fight sequences allowing certain enemies to be offscreen translated poorly to gameplay.\n\n\"Eurogamer\" ranked the game ninth on their list of the \"Top 50 Games of 2017\", \"GamesRadar+\" ranked it 16th on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017, and EGMNow ranked it 19th in their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017, while \"Polygon\" ranked it 24th on their list of the 50 best games of 2017. The game received nominations for \"Best PC Game\", \"Best PlayStation 4 Game\", \"Best Action-Adventure Game\", \"Best Graphics\", \"Best Story\", and \"Most Innovative\" (the latter for which it became a runner-up) at IGN's Best of 2017 Awards.\n\nThe game's depiction of psychosis was applauded, and often described as the game's greatest quality. Several media outlets and reviewers analysed the game's depiction of psychosis in more detail: it was noted that all parts of the game, including the fights and puzzles, were made to further the depiction of Senua's psychosis and revolved around her condition. Paul Fletcher, a neuroscientist and psychosis expert at the University of Cambridge who worked on the game, said that \"It’s been exciting to see Senua received so positively by those who have lived with experiences of psychosis\".\n\nMichael Briers of \"PlayStationLifeStyle.net\", stated that, \"by working closely with neuroscientists and those unfortunate few who have been diagnosed as psychotic, \"Hellblade\" carefully avoids those cheap, half-assed tropes that render a character insane and, therefore, woefully one-dimensional. Not only does it act as a disservice to those who suffer with mental illness, this practice of painting in broad strokes only minimizes the room for nuance, but \"Senua’s Sacrifice\" boldly cuts through the white noise\". Leif Johnson of \"PC Gamer\" praised the gripping depiction of a character suffering from psychosis, stating \"Ninja Theory uses haunted eyes to full effect in long, moody closeups peppering the narrative. [Senua] peers not only into the darkness, but seemingly past the camera, past the screen. Looking back, I found depths of despair and anger there that were sometimes hard to meet head on [...] Some people would crumble under such pain. But still Senua fights. It's a little inspiring.\"\n\nAlice Bell of \"VideoGamer.com\" noted that although Senua's psychosis is a cause of tragedy in her life, the game also depicted her condition as something that can bring her contentment, stating that her hallucinations are sometimes \"actually lovely too, reflecting that psychosis can manifest as colour and beauty.\" Regarding the story as a whole, she stated \"you [the player] learn about the trauma Senua has faced, made greater by her struggles with her own mental health and others' lack of understanding of it. Great care has been taken, with input every step of the way from psychologists and people who have experienced psychosis, to give as faithful a representation of it as possible. The hardest battles are fought in the mind, says Dillion, although Senua has physical battles as well\".\n\nMollie L Patterson of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" declared that \"while I can’t speak to that side of things from personal experience, I can tell you that I was legitimately affected by [Senua's] condition at times. Playing a good portion of the game with headphones on, quiet moments were often broken by the never-ending chatter of those other selves conflicting in their thoughts, with some wanting to help their host in her quest, and others constantly telling Senua (and you) that she was wrong in her choices, that she was destined to failure, or that it was all hopeless. It’s hard to explain how powerful those words can be, even as a player detached from Senua’s condition, and it was one of many elements that helped form a bond between us.\n\nShoemaker also stated \"\"Hellblade\"s single most powerful trick is a near-constant stream of voices in Senua's head, recorded with a spatial audio technique so they feel like they're all around you, nagging at you, undermining your decisions and your confidence. These voices are frequently in conflict with what you're doing and even with each other; one side can be encouraging you while the other mocks you mercilessly. The effect is striking. Over time Senua's pain becomes palpable, incontestable, especially as the stress worsens the longer these voices harangue you, the more vicious and deranged they become. It's important to remember that you as the player, though, have the luxury of turning them off whenever you want. \"Hellblade\"s robust bag of psychological tricks and the sheer fact of Senua's distressing reality result in the game's uncommon ability to capture the feelings of worthlessness, lack of control, of being misunderstood and shunned, the strange mix of hope and despair that can accompany a debilitating mental illness\".\n\nNot all media outlets were satisfied with the game's depiction of the condition. In an article he published to criticize the game, \"Mic\" gaming editor Jason Faulkner, who had experience working with the mentally ill, praised Senua's character, but was highly critical of the game, stating that it should have focused on helping people to truly understand psychosis, and have the condition be \"focal and explicit\", instead of representing it metaphorically: \"If you go into the game without any background information, you might assume that Senua is living with delusions and Norse mythology-inspired hallucinations — or you might think that she’s being haunted by demons and ghosts. [...] The portrayal of Senua’s mental illness would be better served by showing both sides of her story: what’s in her head and what’s actually happening.\" He also stated that the game \"stifles the opportunity to inject commentary about the broader picture of mental health care\", notably by not depicting caregivers or other people dedicated to helping those with mental illness in real life. Unlike most articles reflecting on the ending, who saw it as a metaphor for Senua learning to live with her illness, Faulkner believed that the ending was magically curing Senua, and condemned the game for it. \"Edge\" deplored that Senua's psychosis was depicted as \"something of an asset: a helpful superpower that can give you the strength to soldier on through the darkness, so long as you can put up with the odd breakdown here and there.\"\n\nEarly in the game, after Senua's hand turns to rot because she got \"tainted\", the Darkness tells her that every time she \"dies\" (every death turns out to be a vision of a possible future), the rot will spread further up, until it reaches her head and consumes her soul; the game implies that, if this happens, it will result in a permadeath, as the player's save would be deleted, and all game progress until then would be erased. However, several media outlets later found out that the rot stops spreading after a certain amount of deaths, and cannot progress further before a certain point in the game, ultimately making it impossible for it to reach Senua's head.\n\nReid McCarter of \"PC Gamer\" strongly defended Ninja Theory's move, calling it \"great game design and a modern expression of unreliable narration\". He stated \"As the story progresses, the nature of the corruption becomes clearer as the player comes to understand a correlation between Senua’s backstory and psychology and the way they perceive the game’s dangers. It is a beautifully executed bit of narrative design, game systems and story working in tandem.\" \"PCGamesN\" called it a \"clever decision\", as it \"focuses on Senua’s own fear of her enemies and degrading mental state\". \"Eurogamer\" called it \"a cool trick that makes the player feel a sense of dread as they're playing the game. Dread, anxiety and death are all themes \"Hellblade\" revolves around. It certainly fits\".\n\nAntoniades said that the permadeath mechanic was a bluff: while the rot will spread on Senua's body over repeated deaths, it will never fully reach her head; the wording they chose to describe this was meant to convey part of the fear associated with mental illness and psychosis directly to the player. Antoniades said \"We were looking for ideas of how you introduce fear, and one of those ideas was the permadeath mechanic. It's the only time we're very explicit about what will happen to you in the game.\" He considered that they believed that players and critics have mistaken their wording on the permadeath mechanic when the game was released, which created a \"blowout\", but he defended their use of the wording as \"it's your interpretation as a player that taints the meaning behind it. That's something we wanted to do on purpose, because with mental illness it's your frame of mind that interprets the world, and that can cause you distress.\"\n\nWhile only released in digital form, \"Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\" was a commercial success. It was the best selling game on the PlayStation Store in Europe for the month of its release. According to director Tameem Antoniades the game sold \"better than expected\" and broke even in approximately three months, ahead of the six to nine months the developers expected. \"PC Gamer\" stated about \"Hellblade\"s success that \"the news can only be positive. Perhaps if other developers see an experimental game like \"Hellblade\" finding commercial success then they'll be more likely to take risks on their own titles—and that, ultimately, will lead to more interesting games\". To celebrate World Mental Health Day on October 10, 2017, Ninja Theory donated all profit made from the sales of \"Hellblade\" on that day to Rethink Mental Illness. By June 2018, the game had sold over a million copies across all three platforms.\n\nIn addition to the awards received by the game, the team of \"Hellblade\", including Antoniades and Juergens, won the award for Best Real-Time Graphics & Interactivity at SIGGRAPH in 2016, for a showcase demonstration of a technique they called \"Realtime Cinematography\", during which they performed and filmed live a scene from \"Hellblade\", which was \"shot, captured and edited to final quality in minutes, a process that would normally take weeks or months\".\n\n"}

The game, released in May 2005, was developed by Haemimont together with FX Interactive.\n\nThe game contains various civilizations to choose from, among them are: Rome (Imperial and Republican), Egypt, Germania, Brittania, Iberia, Gaul and Carthage. It has a more elaborate hero system over its predecessor.\n\nThe game focuses on tactics, troop mobility and terrain topography rather than sheer strength of numbers for winning battles. Though resources are important, there is less relevance in gathering them than in other real-time battle games. Instead of sending an army of servants to mine, lumber, collect food or gather any other kind of resources these are generated at a constant rate directly proportional to the inhabitants of a population center.\n\nThere are 3 player modes to choose from:\n\n\nThere are different civilizations to choose from, each with unique weakness and strengths: Egypt, Carthage, Republican Rome, Imperial Rome, Gallia, Germania, Hispania and Britannia.\n\n\"Imperivm: Great Battles of Rome\" revives the battles which made Ancient Rome one of the great empire of the world, such as the Siege of Numantia, August victory against Mark Antony and Cleopatra in Egypt, Marcus Aurelius campaign against the Germans in the north of the Rhin river, Viriathus uprising in the West Iberian Peninsula and the Siege of Alesia leadered by Julius Caesar.\n\nA special kind of unit called hero, which has become standard on Real-Time Strategy and Real-Time Tactic games, is used to group the different classes of soldiers under one command.\n\nAs a soldier builds up on experience he becomes more effective in combat.\n\nBy assaulting keeps a civilization can also gain access to loot like extra food or gold.\n\nUnlike normal military units, heroes are generally stronger and more valuable in battle. Their main strength lies in the ability to attach a group of up to 50 units, which from then on would follow their commands. When attached, the units receive part of the hero's experience as a bonus to their own. In addition, heroes arrange armies in specific formations that provide their units with an additional bonus when executing the stand ground command. Unlike units each hero has five skills that are unique to them and their civilization. These improve not only their individual combat abilities but also that of their army. Some of them are beneficial to the hero and the units attached to the hero. Other skills are beneficial to the units or help during battles.\n\nThere are four kind of formations in the game: Square, Block, Line and Center Cavalry. Each gives different bonus. Usually the maximum number of units on an army is limited to 50 but in the case of Republican Rome this cap can be pushed up to 70.\n\nAlso, different formations favors mixes on soldiers classes quantities. For example; choosing a line formation would benefit an army composed of a majority of ranged attackers.\n\nBy grouping two or more Generals the size of an army can be effectively increased. Orders can be issued simultaneously to each General who in turn would relay them to their troops. Conveniently once that the positions of the joined armies have been set, the computer will make the best effort to keep the defined distance between groups.\n\nThis feature gives more possibilities since this allows specialization of groups. Each can choose the more convenient formation, for instance, two armies, one composed only from ranged attackers and the other of a good mix of melee troops, can choose line and block respectively.\n\nAs a unit gets to see more action his skill level increases; every unit has a level to reflect this, thus it is possible to get a favorable outcome when facing a numerically superior enemy with battle hardened troops, the most appropriate formation and some maneuvering.\n\nThere are several classes of populations centers.\n\nThese population centers produce food at a constant rate. Each one has a population limit and current living people, depending on the completeness of population the production rate decreases or increases, also the people can be transferred to keeps or fortresses. Campaigning Troops can be supplied from these places though is much more useful to use scorched earth tactics to avoid defending a counterattack if the village is at the very end of the supply lines.\n\nThe main establishment; this is where the player recruits troops, make most of the basic training for them and upgrade certain abilities. Every walled city has a tavern, a coliseum, a blacksmith, a temple for the gods and a certain class of town center. What varies, according to the civilization, is what can be obtained on those buildings.\n\nThese are smaller than the walled city but play an important role by gathering resources as extra money or soldiers. Among them are: Gold Keep, Trading Keep and Training Keep.\n\nThe most obvious uses are as a forward base and defense point, keeps (no matter what class of keep) will attack any hostile nation party within certain range, but only when they have at least one occupant, the rate of fire can be increased by garrisoning more soldiers at the building but a line of supply must be established in order to keep alive the troops inside the fortification.\n\n\nThese are used to increase the power of your priest by performing rituals or they can contain powerful magic items that increase wielder's stats.\n\n\"Liga Imperivm\" is the online version of the game where players can chat and fight one against others. There are different ranks, and from lowest to highest punctuation, it is formed by slave, liberto, plebeian, patrician, decurion, centurion, praefectus, tribune, legatus, aedile, priest, magistrate, senator, censor, quaestor, praetor, consul, proconsul, governor and emperor.\n\nIn 2005 it was organized the firt Liga Imperivm championship, where players faced in a 1vs1 or 2vs2 duel. The winner got a trophy and 5000€.\n\nDuring E3 2006 it was announced that the video game sold more than 1 million copies and it became a Platinum title. It has been awarded by ADESE (Entertainment Software Editors and Distributors Spanish Association) a \"Double Platinum Disc\" for selling 160,000 units during 2005 in Spain.\n\n"}

{"id": "2271598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271598", "title": "Just Lose It", "text": "Just Lose It\n\n\"Just Lose It\" is a song by American rapper Eminem from his fifth studio album, \"Encore\" (2004). It was released on September 28, 2004 as the lead single from \"Encore\", and was later included on his greatest hits compilation album, \"\" (2005). The song caused controversy as its lyrics and music video parodies Michael Jackson, who was being accused of child molestation at the time. The song also pokes fun at Beavis/Cornholio, MC Hammer, Madonna, and others. It also heavily spoofs Pee-wee Herman, going as far as imitating his signature shout during the chorus and Eminem dressing like him in the video.\n\nThe song peaked at number 6\non the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the United States and reached number one in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom as well as the top 10 in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway.\n\nTwo skits regarding the Michael Jackson controversy were included on \"Encore\", \"Paul (Skit)\" and \"Em Calls Paul (Skit)\". The lyrics to \"Just Lose It\" refer to Jackson's legal troubles, however he does state in his song \"... and that's not a stab at Michael, That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho...\" At the beginning of the song there is a lyrical excerpt from Eminem's 2002 single \"Without Me\" about how \"Shady's back\". The line \"Snap back to reality. Look! It's B. Rabbit\" and \"You signed me up to battle\" refers to \"Lose Yourself\" and Eminem's character in the movie \"8 Mile\". In the second verse of the song there is a line \"So fellas, fellas...\" which is a reference to Sir Mix-a-Lot's song \"Baby Got Back\". The line \"Girl you know you're my world,\" from the chorus, is a reference to the chorus of his song \"Superman\" from his album \"The Eminem Show\".\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it too similar to Eminem's previous work. AllMusic highlighted the song in a review of the album. Pitchfork was also positive: \"'Just Lose It' is still most notable for dancing with paedo and homoerotic imagery: It's the one track here that seems as potentially multilayered as the best of \"The Marshall Mathers LP\", yet it's still more curio than anything else.\" \"NME\" wrote: \"Em (is) reduced to making funny noises to keep things interesting.\" David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\", however, felt mixed: \"First [on the album] came the sarcastically bouncy \"Just Lose It\", a lazy retread of earlier hits that, with its easy-target references to Michael Jackson, made Eminem appear to be the one who'd actually lost it.\" J-23 panned the song and called it \"by far the worst song Eminem or Dr. Dre has ever made. It really seems like their object here was to make the worst song possible. The interlude leading into it is damn hilarious though.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"the album's hilarious slap at celebrity voyeurism, with Eminem himself a prominent target.\"\n\nRapReviews argued that it isn't \"dropping any jaws or widening any eyes.\" \"Rolling Stone\" described this song as \"dance-music dis.\" In a review praising \"Encore\"'s \"edginess,\" Steve Jones of USA Today cited the song's mocking of the Michael Jackson child-molestation scandal. Alexis Petridis of \"The Guardian\", however, wrote: \"[Eminem's] plan appears to involve belching and making fart noises, which, with the best will in the world, won't suffice.\" Kelefa Sanneh of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the song \"unfolds as a series of puzzlingly unfunny jokes.\" \"Stylus Magazine\" was negative as well, calling it \"Em’s brand new tendency to bite himself.\" \"The Austin Chronicle\" was a bit negative as well: \"Where 2002 smash 'Without Me' was bitingly clever, \"Encore\"s carbon copy 'Just Lose It' is puerile and embarrassing, even though he quotes \"Beavis and Butt-head\" and does a wicked Pee-wee Herman.\" \"Slant Magazine\" said that the song \"was so derivative that it had to be a joke—even the song’s title seemed to mock the Academy Award-winning \"8 Mile\" theme song that elevated the Great White Rapper to a whole new level of acceptance (as if he hadn’t already transcended nearly every other boundary in pop culture). Not only is 'Just Lose It' the worst song on \"Encore\", it’s easily one of the most annoying songs of the year (credit Em’s incessant Pee Wee Herman impersonations and tired attacks on Michael Jackson).\" In 2012, Todd In The Shadows of Channel Awesome named it #1 on his Top Ten Worst Hit Songs of 2004 list, criticizing Eminem's flow, the lyrical content, and how unfunny the song was.\n\nThe video contains a parody of a rap battle scene from \"8 Mile\" in which it is Eminem, as B-Rabbit, versus Eminem, as Slim Shady. It also contains several scenes where Eminem is walking down the streets naked. As he is doing this, Dr. Dre is seen driving next to him, looking disgusted. For the music video, the lyrics were edited slightly, notably the phrase \"shake that ass\", becoming the less provocative \"shake that thing\". Other changes include the muting of some parts of the second verse, and the phrase \"butt naked\" becoming \"buck naked\". Such examples of parodies that are included in this video are Michael Jackson, MC Hammer and his hit single \"U Can't Touch This\", Pee-wee Herman, Madonna and the movie \"Bad Santa\", by displaying Eminem as a \"mall santa\" and even going so far to include Tony Cox, the actor who played the elf from the actual movie, as Eminem's helper. Some of the celebrities who appeared in this music video were Paris Hilton, Monica Parales, Erik Estrada, Alyson Stoner, BooBoo Stewart, Omar Benson Miller, De'Angelo Wilson, Mekhi Phifer and Dr. Dre. The video was later nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rap Video, but lost to Ludacris' \"Number One Spot\". Much Music's 50 Most Controversial Videos ranked it #1 for its jokes on famous people.\n\nThe music video for \"Just Lose It\" generated controversy by parodying singer Michael Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and an incident in 1984 when Jackson's hair caught fire whilst filming a Pepsi commercial. \n\nA week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson called into Steve Harvey's radio show to report his displeasure with the video. \"I am very angry at Eminem's depiction of me in his video,\" Jackson said in the interview. \"I feel that it is outrageous and disrespectful. It is one thing to spoof, but it is another to be demeaning and insensitive.\" Jackson continued: \"I've admired Eminem as an artist, and was shocked by this. The video was inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family and the community at large.\" Many of Jackson's supporters and friends spoke out about the video, including Stevie Wonder, who called it \"kicking a man while he's down\" and \"bullshit\", and Harvey, who declared, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back.\" The video was banned on the BET channel, after complaints from Benzino and others (but was later reinstated, as critics of the ban argued that Nelly's \"Tip Drill\" video which has been alleged to be misogynistic was aired. Both were only seen on \"\".) However MTV did not drop it, and the video became one of the most requested on the channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!Country\n!Certification\n!Sales certified\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark\n!scope=\"row\"|New Zealand\n!scope=\"row\"|Norway\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n!scope=\"row\"|United States\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50000811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50000811", "title": "Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV", "text": "Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV\n\nKingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV is a 2016 Japanese computer-animated fantasy film directed by Takeshi Nozue and scripted by Takashi Hasegawa from a story by Kazushige Nojima and Saori Itamuro. Developed primarily by Square Enix's exclusive CGI studio Visual Works, \"Kingsglaive\" is based on the setting and story of the 2016 video game \"Final Fantasy XV\", which is thematically connected to the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" subseries. \"Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV\" released theatrically in July 2016 in Japan by Aniplex, and received a limited theatrical run in August in North America by Stage 6 Films. Digital and physical home video versions were released in October 2016, and the film was bundled with different editions of \"Final Fantasy XV\" alongside \"\".\n\n\"Kingsglaive\" runs parallel with the events of \"Final Fantasy XV\", focusing on Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII, the father of main character Noctis. The main protagonists are from the Kingsglaive, an elite combat corps who share Regis's magical powers and defend the kingdom of Lucis and its Crystal from the invading empire of Niflheim. Faced with continued detrimental conflict, Regis accepts an armistice with Niflheim: as part of the peace treaty, his son must marry Lady Lunafreya Nox Fleuret of the imperial province of Tenebrae. The treaty turns out to be a ruse for Niflheim to invade, and Kingsglaive soldier Nyx Ulric is caught up with Regis and Lunafreya in a battle to secure the future of Lucis. The movie's voice cast includes Gō Ayano, Shiori Kutsuna and Tsutomu Isobe in Japanese; and Aaron Paul, Lena Headey and Sean Bean in English.\n\n\"Kingsglaive\" was made as part of a planned multimedia expansion of \"Final Fantasy XV\" to negate having to develop a series of games using the setting and characters. Beginning production in 2014 by the same team that created \"\" (2005), \"Kingsglaive\" used discarded concepts from the original version of \"Final Fantasy XV\"s story, with the aim being to create a self-contained experience with a dedicated cast and relatable plot. Multiple external studios were brought in to help complete the project within the short development time. Its announcement was delayed to 2016 due to the early reveal of \"Final Fantasy XV\". \"Kingsglaive\" grossed $6.55 million during its limited theatrical run and earned a further in the United States from its DVD and Blu-ray releases. Reception to the movie was mixed, with praise going to the visuals and lead actors' performances, while the story and supporting cast were widely criticized.\n\n\"Kingsglaive\" takes place on the Earth-like world of Eos, running parallel to the opening events of \"Final Fantasy XV\". The kingdom of Lucis is home to a magical Crystal, given to humanity by the world's deities and used by the ruling Caelum dynasty to defend Lucis from invaders via a magical barrier known as the Wall. The Crystal is kept in a special chamber within the Royal Citadel, its powers only accessible through the hereditary Ring of the Lucii. For centuries, Lucis has been at war with the militaristic and technologically advanced empire of Niflheim, which has conquered the other nations using its Magitek armies.\n\nLucis's crown city Insomnia is protected from Niflheim by the Kingsglaive—an elite corps made up of immigrants from beyond the city limits with whom the Crystal's power are shared by the ruling monarch Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII. The movie opens with Regis accepting a peace treaty with Niflheim: as part of the treaty, Regis must cede the territories around Insomnia to Niflheim and have his son Prince Noctis marry Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, former princess of Tenebrae.\n\nDuring a visit to Tenebrae, Regis and Noctis—who is recuperating from a near-death experience—are targeted for assassination by Niflheim. Tenebrae is subsequently attacked, and in the invasion Queen Sylva is killed by Niflheim's General Glauca. Regis attempts to flee with Lunafreya, but she decides to stay with her brother Ravus; both become subjects under Niflheim's rule.\n\nTwelve years later, the Kingsglaive fight to protect Lucis's borders from attacks by Niflheim's Magitek army and Daemons, unnatural monsters tamed for military use. During one such operation, Nyx Ulric defies his orders to withdraw to rescue his friend Libertus from a Daemon. Regis, whose magic powers the Wall and is growing weaker due to advancing age, accepts Imperial Chancellor Ardyn Izunia's offer of peace. This causes dissension among the Kingsglaive, who feel Regis is abandoning their families. Two days before the treaty is to be signed, Kingsglaive member Crowe is sent on a mission to escort Lunafreya to Altissia to meet Noctis, but is killed en route. Her death causes Libertus to leave the Kingsglaive and join a group of Lucian rebels. At a party dedicated to the signing of the treaty, attended by both Regis and Niflheim's emperor Iedolas Aldercapt, Lunafreya meets with Nyx before being secretly abducted by Glauca. Nyx discovers this and finds that Niflheim has stationed their army outside Insomnia.\n\nRegis agrees to deploy the Kingsglaive, although their commander Drautos has disappeared. While Nyx succeeds in rescuing Lunafreya, many of the Kingsglaive turn on him; Nyx, Lunafreya and rebel leader Luche Lazarus escape as the ship disintegrates. At the treaty-signing ceremony, the Niflheim delegation springs a surprise attack and kills the ruling council, while their army enters by destroying the Wall with help from the rebels, who are subsequently massacred. Lunafreya and Nyx reach the Citadel just as Regis is battling Glauca. During the fight, Glauca cuts the Ring of the Lucii from Regis's hand. Ravus attempts to put on the Ring and claim its power, but it rejects him and destroys his arm before he can remove it. Nyx, Lunafreya and Regis retrieve the Ring and flee with Glauca in pursuit. Regis forces the two to go on without him, dying in his ensuing battle with Glauca. Aldercapt and Ardyn—having successfully stolen the Crystal—leave Insomnia to be destroyed by Niflheim's Daemons.\n\nSummoned to the city plaza by a call from Drautos, Nyx and Lunafreya are cornered by Luche, who reveals himself to be Crowe's killer. Luche almost kills Nyx before being tricked by Lunafreya into putting on the Ring, resulting in his death. Drautos then appears, but is attacked by Libertus, who reveals that Drautos is in fact Glauca. Just as Glauca is about to kill them, Nyx puts on the Ring. He is confronted by the spirits of the past kings of Lucis; initially rejected due to being not of their bloodline, his resolve and the threat to the Crystal persuade them to allow his use of their power at the cost of his life. After fending off Glauca, Nyx returns the Ring to Lunafreya before entrusting her to Libertus, telling them to flee. With the Ring's borrowed power he engages Glauca in a titanic battle throughout Insomnia, animating the city's statues of past rulers, known as the \"Old Wall,\" to combat Niflheim's Daemons. Their fight ends as dawn approaches, with Nyx mortally wounding Glauca; Nyx dies shortly after as payment for using the Ring's power, wishing for Noctis to rule well in the future. In the aftermath, Libertus escorts Lunafreya out of the city, but she tells him to stay behind. Lunafreya then leaves with the Ring to find Noctis.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Noctis and his companions are en route to Altissia when their car breaks down, leading into the opening scenes of \"Final Fantasy XV\".\n\n\nOther characters include the various members of the Kingsglaive and Regis' council: Banjō Ginga / John DeMita as Clarus Amicitia, father to main character Gladiolus; Wataru Takagi / Ben Diskin as Pelna Khara; and Fuminori Komatsu / Max Mittelman as Tredd Furia. Unvoiced characters include Kingsglaive members Sonitus Bellum and Axis Arra. While both English and Japanese voicetracks were produced, lip syncing for all versions was matched to the English voice work. The lead voice actors, such as Paul, were chosen so they would be recognized and appeal to a wide audience, in addition to their acting abilities. The Japanese voice casting followed a similar model, choosing well-known actors for the lead roles. Casting was handled by Rui Kawada, who also acted as general project manager. The compartmentalization of the development meant that the characters were mostly voiced by different actors to \"Final Fantasy XV\". Originally there were plans for both the movie and game voice cast to cross over, but these were scrapped.\n\n\"Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV\" forms part of the \"\"Final Fantasy XV\" Universe\", a multimedia project based around the 2016 video game \"Final Fantasy XV\" that includes the original net animation series \"\": the story of \"XV\", originally a spin-off title called \"Final Fantasy Versus XIII\", was large enough to have covered several games, but as the team did not want to create any additional games, they decided to create additional media. While similar in style to the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\" project, the media associated with \"Final Fantasy XV\" came before the game's release rather than after it, acting as insight into the world and characters. \"XV\" and its associated media likewise hold a thematic connection to \"Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy\", a compilation of games and associated media sharing a common mythos while boasting unconnected stories and settings. While distanced from the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" brand for marketing purposes, the world of \"XV\" still uses its mythos and design elements. \"Kingsglaive\" was designed so it would not be necessary for people to watch to understand the main game. Despite this, references to the events of \"Kingsglaive\" were included in the game. Following the release of the game, director Hajime Tabata described \"Kingsglaive\" and \"Brotherhood\" as granting a better view of the game's world, adding that those who only played the game might notice the missing context.\n\n\"Kingsglaive\" was primarily developed by Visual Works, a division of \"Final Fantasy\" developer Square Enix dedicated to the creation of CGI cutscenes. The director was Takeshi Nozue. Nozue's previous notable experience with feature-length productions was the 2005 feature \"\". While he had been co-director of \"Advent Children\", he was sole director of \"Kingsglaive\". Tabata acted as producer. While compared upon reveal to \"Advent Children\", it was stressed that the two served very different purposes: while \"Advent Children\" was designed for fans of its parent title \"Final Fantasy VII\" (1997), \"Kingsglaive\" was intended for both prospective players of \"Final Fantasy XV\" and people new to the \"Final Fantasy\" series, acting as an entry point into the narrative of \"Final Fantasy XV\". The project was also much greater in scale than \"Advent Children\", requiring help from multiple external studios. Nozue later commented that another aspect of \"Kingsglaive\" was to bolster sales of the game's platforms prior to release, with a movie offering a greater means of reaching potential buyers. Production work on \"Kingsglaive\" began three years prior to its release, with full development beginning in 2014 after an extended period of preparatory work. From this point, production lasted approximately two and a half years.\n\nSo the production could be managed in the short time available, the movie's development was separated into three phases, with each phase being dedicated to a particular part of the production process and run by a different unit director answering to Nozue. The movie went through multiple phases of trial and error until the final product was solidified. \"Kingsglaive\" was kept a secret until 2016 when it was near completion, as the developers felt that they had announced its parent video game too early. So as to remain close to the development of \"Final Fantasy XV\", the lead staff of \"Kingsglaive\" moved from Visual Works to Business Division 2, the department of Square Enix responsible for the game's development. This was part of an overall shift in development methods when the game was changed from a spin-off to a mainline entry. In addition to the staff of \"Advent Children\", Western companies in gaming and movie production were involved: Digic Pictures, who had worked on the graphics for the \"Assassin's Creed\" series; and Image Engine, who had worked on multiple films including \"Jurassic World\" (2015) and the television series \"Game of Thrones\". According to Nozue, around 50 different companies were involved in the film's production: among these was Europe-based company Puppetworks Animation Studio. The internal team was estimated at around 50 people. The cooperation of studios overseas meant that work on the movie could proceed continuously. Without this external aid, Nozue estimated that they would have needed a staff of five hundred people to complete the film in the given timeframe.\n\nThe story of \"Kingsglaive\" was based around a portion of the original opening of \"Final Fantasy XV\", which would have shown the invasion of Insomnia by Niflheim's army. This had to be cut from the game due to concerns over the volume of content, but as the team still wanted to show this event, they incorporated it into the plot of \"Kingsglaive\". To ensure a connection between the movie and the game, both projects used the same shared script as their core. That script was written by Saori Itamuro based on a draft by Kazushige Nojima. The team also wanted a proper cinematic experience that would appeal to a large audience, so they brought in a professional screenwriter, Takashi Hasegawa, to create a full-length cinematic script. Los Angeles-based company Hydra Entertainment assisted with creating the script alongside Hasegawa, in addition to writing assistance from Hollywood staff. The storyline was designed to complement and set the stage for the events of \"Final Fantasy XV\" without revealing major plot elements from the game. The movie was created for a primarily English audience, with the script translation handled by Square Enix's in-house localization team. As many team members were \"Final Fantasy\" fans, frequent nostalgic references to earlier entries in the series were included.\n\nThe central theme for the overall story of \"Final Fantasy XV\" was the bond between father and son: \"Kingsglaive\" represented the theme from the father Regis' point of view. According to Nozue, another key element during the early segment of the movie was displaying how the world's society sees Regis's responsibilities, along with the emotions involved in such a role. The main goal for the film's characters was to portray them as normal people with character flaws, rather than magical superheroes. Nyx was an original character created for the movie with no connection to the events of the game, intended to act as a medium for the wider audience \"Kingsglaive\" was aimed at. Nyx also provided a medium for the story themes surrounding immigration issues, which in turn brought the audience closer to the main cast. While Nyx was original, multiple key characters from the game played prominent roles, particularly Regis, Lunafreya, and Ardyn. Lunafreya was highlighted as the \"keystone\" connecting the game, the movie, and the anime series \"Brotherhood\". While her role in the film was not an active one, her strength was conveyed through her single-minded devotion to her goals.\n\nPrior to full production, the team created a tech demo in 2012 to test the creation and movement of highly detailed models and environments. This tech demo was titled \"Agni's Philosophy\", which also acted as a test demo for the Luminous Studio engine which would be used for \"Final Fantasy XV\". Character designs and modelling was overseen by Business Division 2; the team was led by Kazuaki Iwasawa, the character model supervisor. The character Crowe's hair was based on the hairstyle for the main female protagonist of \"Agni's Philosophy\". The hairstyles for both Crowe and Lunafreya were first modelled using a real mannequin wig to ensure they could be managed. Their fully rendered wigs were composed of three thousand curves each, a thousand more than originally estimated.\n\nThe characters' body and facial movements were recorded using motion capture: these included capturing static figures for dialogue segments, and full-body capture for action sequences. The motion actors provided the basis for their characters' appearance: the actors were chosen based on how well they fitted with the staff's vision for the characters. The motion actors' facial expressions were captured using a special head-mounted rig the team had previously developed for the 2012 tech demo. When the character designs were being created, Nozue needed to regularly consult professional hairstylists to ensure that their chosen hairstyles for characters would be feasible in real life. For characters who appeared in the game, the team tried to keep their facial features as close as possible to their in-game counterpart. As with other Japanese CGI films aiming for a realistic tone, the team relied on photogrammetry and an extensive 3D scanning process combined with motion capture. Character clothing was created in a similar way to real-life clothing, with a number of different design variations being tested using paper cutouts. Something that both in-house and external staff contended with was making character movements realistic without being symmetrical; the biggest example was Libertus's need to walk on crutches for much of the movie, shifting his weight balance and movement speed.\n\nInsomnia—the capital of Lucis—was based in general on international cities, while its core was based on Tokyo: Western elements were added based on fan criticism of Insomnia being too similar to Tokyo during the game's early stages. The design of the Niflheim airships was an updated version of those in the earlier days of \"Final Fantasy XV\"s development, when it was known as \"Versus XIII\". Regis was extensively redesigned for the movie, which in turn altered his appearance in the game. Initially created with a younger appearance, the team wanted him to have a proper regal air so he would have presence in \"Kingsglaive\", so they aged the character significantly and created a story-based context for the change. The overall theme of the \"Final Fantasy XV\" universe was \"a fantasy based on reality\": to reinforce this, Square Enix collaborated with Audi on a custom version of their Audi R8 model as the royal family's personal transport, and included references to real-world brands and companies such as Japan Airlines. Most of the movie's individual props such as the car, Nyx's daggers, the Niflheim mechs and the Ring of the Lucii were created and rendered before main production had begun.\n\nLighting and its effect on characters' skin was of particular importance to the Business Division 2 team, with a lot of work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially going to be done entirely in-house, but the team eventually decided to bring in The Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the V-Ray software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create \"Kingsglaive\", they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.\n\nThe film's score was composed by John R. Graham, with the main theme by Yoko Shimomura, the composer for \"Final Fantasy XV\". The score for \"Kingsglaive\" was described by Nozue as \"Shimomura meets Hollywood\". This effect was reinforced by Graham's work. According to Graham, Nozue wanted a complex musical score. The harmonics and themes change throughout the score to create both an ambiguous atmosphere and a sense of impending tragedy and loss. Graham was brought on board to create a score that would fill the film's world and act as a counterbalance to Shimomura's music from the game, which was incorporated into the overall score. Due to the themes and events of \"Kingsglaive\", Graham needed his music to reflect the weight, contradictions, and shifting \"light and dark\" perspectives of the characters and locations. To achieve this, he used a combination of live orchestra and electronic elements. He wrote more than 100 minutes of music. Recording was done in Nashville using a symphonic orchestra. The soundtrack was released as a two-disc album on September 7, 2016.\n\n\"Kingsglaive\" was first announced in March 2016 at \"Uncovered: \"Final Fantasy XV\"\", a media event dedicated to the game. Its release was handled by publisher Square Enix and distributor Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. At the time, no theatrical release was announced for the West. In June at the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo, it was announced that \"Kingsglaive\" would receive a limited theatrical release in North America, beginning on August 19; its theatrical release was handled by Stage 6 Films with Vertical Entertainment and Square Enix. A further week's run was announced for some areas. It was later announced that Le Grand Rex would be hosting a French premiere for \"Kingsglaive\" on September 15. \"Kingsglaive\" released in Japanese cinemas through Aniplex on July 9, 2016 where day one fans were given exclusive Lunafreya post cards. Tickets went on sale on April 23. Prior to its theatrical release, a television special titled \"XV Universe Report\" aired in Japan, featuring behind-the-scenes information and interviews regarding \"Final Fantasy XV\" and its associated media. \"Kingsglaive\" was included on Blu-ray in the \"Deluxe Edition\" and \"Ultimate Collector's Edition\" of \"Final Fantasy XV\", which were released worldwide on November 29, 2016. The movie was also included in the \"\"Final Fantasy XV\" Film Collection\", a box set which includes \"Final Fantasy XV\" and \"Brotherhood\". The digital version of the film was released on streaming and download services on August 30 2016; the standalone Blu-ray and DVD versions were released on October 4 2016.\n\nThe film debuted in Japan in 10th place, selling 22,818 tickets for a total of 35,516,460 yen (US$345,507) in two days. By July 20, over 70,000 tickets had been sold, bringing a total gross of over 105,000,000 yen in Japan (). Its high takings were attributed to positive word of mouth following the initial release. During the openings of its limited run in the United States, the film grossed a further $190,000. It eventually grossed $269,980 in the region. Upon release in China in March 2017, the film entered at #4 in the top-grossing films of that week, being the highest grossing new release with $3.90 million. The film went on to gross in China. Its total worldwide gross reached over $6.4 million as of April 2017. The home video releases of \"Kingsglaive\" were among the top 20 best-selling DVD and Blu-ray releases for October 2016. The two releases reached a combined gross of $4,549,411 in the United States.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 13%, based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average to reviews, the film has a score of 35 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Critics were generally negative about the film, although popular opinion rendered a more positive response.\n\nChristian Holub of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a score of C+, describing the film as a long cutscene for fans of the game rather than something equivalent to the recent \"Warcraft\" movie adaptation: he said that the visuals \"offer a deep dive into the Uncanny Valley\", and praised the lead actors' efforts with a script he found weak. Meghan Sullivan, writing for IGN, gave the movie a score of 6/10: she called the movie \"gorgeous\", and praised the character design despite some issues with realistic facial expressions, and found the story was bogged down by the political elements when the action side and the plot focusing on the Kingsglaive worked. In contrast, she called the voicework \"solid\", saying that the leads brought their characters to life and prevented the script from sounding too ridiculous while the supporting cast was weaker overall. She summed up \"Kingsglaive\" as \"a very beautiful and very confusing movie\". Andrew Barker for \"Variety\" frequently questioned whether \"Kingsglaive\" could count as a movie, as he often felt like he was watching a recorded gameplay video, praising the visuals while generally faulting the plot as rushed and too full of throwaway characters. Wired's Matt Kamen gave the film a score of 5/10. He greatly praised the movie's visuals, and was positive about the lead actors' performances and the action scenes. His criticism was leveled at its poor portrayal of the female characters, called the narrative confusing, and felt that it focused too much on setting up the events of \"Final Fantasy XV\". His main feeling was that, while it held promise, it relied too much on character stereotypes and world building, calling it \"a gorgeous but over-stuffed slice of fanservice\".\n\nEurogamer's Aoife Wilson found it difficult to pin down why she had enjoyed the movie, as she found it \"bloated and badly done,\" ending up saying that, despite its flaws, it felt like part of the \"Final Fantasy\" franchise. She again praised the visuals, but found the dialog to be the movie's weakest point despite the efforts of the lead actors. She summed up \"Kingsglaive\" by saying that \"as a two-hour piece of promotional material for a game, it works\". Scott Clay of RPGFan called watching the movie a necessity for fully understanding the world of \"Final Fantasy XV\", and praised it for its visuals and action scenes, although he noted that there were probably better action movies available. He felt that \"Kingsglaive\" managed to get him invested in the story of \"Final Fantasy XV\", saying that \"[the movie] is no masterpiece — in fact, it's nowhere close to one — but it does its job nicely by setting up what could potentially be a very cool story\". Polygon's Ashley Oh missed the character development usually seen in the \"Final Fantasy\" games although the cast did their best with the script, and while she found the visuals \"jaw-droppingly gorgeous\" and enjoyed the references to other \"Final Fantasy\" titles, she found the story \"very weak\". She also faulted the lack of strong female characters, something that had been a noted feature in earlier \"Final Fantasy\" titles. In contrast to the majority of reviewers, Anthony John Agnello of GamesRadar gave the movie a perfect score of 5/5 stars, calling it \"an expert blend of world building, humanity, and the magical strangeness of \"Final Fantasy\"\" and praising it for balancing its scene setting for \"Final Fantasy XV\" with creating a relatable experience, in addition to lauding its visuals and relatable characters. GameSpot's Alexa Ray Corriea was also fairly positive: while she noted that it was not a coherent movie on its own, she felt that it was a first step by Square Enix to regain fan trust after earlier missteps. She generally enjoyed the story despite a few contrived elements, and gave unanimous praise to the movie's large-scale and more intimate visuals.\n\n"}

The musical was produced by Michael Frazier and Fred Walker, and the cast album was produced by Quincy Jones. The show opened on May 12, 1981, and after 333 performances, closed on June 30, 1982, Horne's 65th birthday. Horne toured with the show in the U.S. and Canada and performed in London and Stockholm in 1984.\n\nLena Horne (born June 30, 1917– May 9, 2010), is an American singer and actress. Horne joined the chorus of the Cotton Club at the age of sixteen and became a band singer and nightclub performer before moving to Hollywood where she had small parts in numerous movies, and much more substantial parts in the films \"Cabin in the Sky\" and \"Stormy Weather\" (1943). Due to the red scare and her progressive political views, she was blacklisted and unable to get work in Hollywood. She returned to her roots as a nightclub performer. In the 1960s she participated in the March on Washington and performed in nightclubs and television. She announced her retirement in March 1980 and performed a two-month farewell tour of the United States. Director Arthur Faria discarded the multi character script called \"Lena's World\" and conceived for her a one-woman show which became \"Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music\"-\n\nThroughout the show Horne sang and danced to Tin Pan Alley songs, jazz standards, music from films in which she had appeared, and songs written for her. The show sought to portray Horne's life from her beginning in show business to the present. During the show she spoke of the racism that she had encountered, describing how Hollywood producers told her she opened her mouth too big when she sang and devised a makeup for her, Light Egyptian, which was applied to white actresses such as Ava Gardner and Hedy Lamarr, who took roles that Horne could have possibly played.\n\nHorne performed her signature song, \"Stormy Weather\", twice in the show, the first time more subdued than the second. She was accompanied by dancers and backup singers. Costumes were designed by Giorgio di Sant' Angelo.\n\nThe Broadway production opened on May 12, 1981, after thirteen previews, and met with a positive critical responses. Stephen Holden, reviewing the album of the show in \"Rolling Stone\", wrote that Horne had \"turned the conventions of the one-person extravaganza inside out...Instead of a self-glorifying ego trip, her performance is a shared journey of self-discovery about the human cost (to the audience as well as the singer) of being a symbol\", adding that Horne's singing \"hits peaks of ferocity, tenderness, playfulness and sheer delight that would have seemed unthinkable in her glamour-girl days...her performance here is a sustained cry of affirmation, and because that affirmation acknowledges the bitterness, cynicism and toughness of the world, it's exceptionally moving in ways that conventionally optimistic musical celebrations rarely are\".\n\n\"Newsweek\" described Horne as \"the most awesome performer to have hit Broadway in years\", while \"The New York Times\" said she \"transforms each song...into an intensely personal story that we've never quite heard before\".\n\nThe show was broadcast on PBS on December 7, 1984. \"New York\" magazine's John Leonard positively reviewed the film, adding that Horne transformed \"pretty tunes and banal lyrics into something that is both erotic and political, a fretting of raw edges\" This performance was later issued on VHS video, it has not been re-issued on DVD as of 2015.\n\nAt the 1981 Drama Desk Awards, \"Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music\" was nominated for four Drama Desk Awards, winning one. It lost the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical to \"The Pirates of Penzance\". Arthur Faria was nominated for the Outstanding Director of a Musical and Thomas Skelton for Outstanding Lighting Design. Horne won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical. In 1981 she won a special Tony Award at the 35th Tony Awards, a special award from the New York Drama Critics' Circle, and the City of New York's Handel Medallion.\n\nAt the 24th Grammy Awards, Quincy Jones and Horne won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album, and Horne won the Grammy for Best Vocal Performance, Female.\n\n\nThe soundtrack of the show was produced by Quincy Jones and released by Jones' record label, Qwest Records. At the Grammy Awards of 1982, Quincy Jones and Horne won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album, and Horne won the Grammy for Best Vocal Performance, Female.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1730307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1730307", "title": "List of Super Bowl halftime shows", "text": "List of Super Bowl halftime shows\n\nHalftime shows are a tradition during American football games at all levels of competition. Entertainment during the Super Bowl, the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), represents a fundamental link to pop culture, which helps broaden the television audience and nationwide interest. As the Super Bowl itself is typically the most-watched event on television in the United States annually, the halftime show has been equally-viewed in recent years: the halftime show of Super Bowl XLIX featuring Katy Perry was viewed by 118.5 million, as part of an overall telecast that peaked at 120.3 million at its conclusion—the most-watched television broadcast in U.S. history. The NFL claims that the Super Bowl LI halftime show, with Lady Gaga was the \"most-watched musical event of all-time,\" citing a figure of 150 million viewers based on the television audience, as well as unique viewership of video postings of the halftime show on the league's platforms, and social media interactions (a metric that was never calculated prior to 2017). However, the show was seen by 117.5 million television viewers, making it the second-highest-rated halftime show.\n\nPrior to the early 1990s, the halftime show was based around a theme, and featured university marching bands (the Grambling State University Marching Band has performed at the most Super Bowl halftime shows, featuring in six shows including at least one per decade from the 1960s to the 1990s), drill teams, and other performance ensembles such as Up with People. Beginning in 1991, the halftime show began to feature pop music acts such as New Kids on the Block and Gloria Estefan. In an effort to boost the prominence of the halftime show to increase viewer interest, Super Bowl XXVII featured a headlining performance by Michael Jackson. After Super Bowl XXXVIII, whose halftime show featured an incident where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts, the halftime show began to feature classic rock acts until the return of headlining pop musicians in 2011.\n\nDuring most of the Super Bowl's first decade, the halftime show featured a college marching band. The show's second decade featured a more varied show, often featuring drill teams and other performance ensembles; the group Up with People produced and starred in four of the performances. The middle of the third decade, in an effort to counter other networks' efforts to counterprogram the game, saw the introduction of popular music acts such as New Kids on the Block, Gloria Estefan, Michael Jackson, Clint Black, Patti LaBelle, and Tony Bennett. Starting with Super Bowl XXXII, commercial sponsors presented the halftime show; within five years, the tradition of having a theme—begun with Super Bowl III—ended, replaced by major music productions by arena rock bands and other high-profile acts. In the six years immediately following an incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts in an alleged \"wardrobe malfunction\", all of the halftime shows consisted of a performance by one artist or group, with the musicians in that era primarily being rock artists from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. These shows were considered \"family friendly\" and the time in which they took place has been described as \"the age of reactionary halftime shows. Since Super Bowl XLV, the halftime show has returned to featuring popular contemporary musicians, with the typical format featuring a single headline artist collaborating with a small number of guest acts.\n\nThe NFL does not pay the halftime show performers an appearance fee, though it covers all expenses for the performers and their entourage of band members management, technical crew, security personnel, family, and friends. Super Bowl XXVII halftime show with Michael Jackson provided an exception, as the NFL and Frito-Lay agreed to make a donation and provide commercial time for Jackson's Heal the World Foundation. According to Nielsen SoundScan data, the halftime performers regularly experience significant spikes in weekly album sales and paid digital downloads due to the exposure. For Super Bowl XLIX, it was reported by the \"Wall Street Journal\" that league officials asked representatives of potential acts if they would be willing to provide financial compensation to the NFL in exchange for their appearance, in the form of either an up-front fee, or a cut of revenue from concert performances made after the Super Bowl. While these reports were denied by an NFL spokeswoman, the request had, according to the \"Journal\", received a \"chilly\" response from those involved.\n\nThe following is a list of the performers, producers, themes, and sponsors for each Super Bowl game's show.\n\nU2 performed 3 songs: \"Beautiful Day,\" \"MLK,\" and \"Where the Streets Have No Name.\" During the beginning of \"MLK\" and continuing until the end of \"Where The Streets Have No Name,\" a large banner behind the band displayed the names of all the people who lost their lives on the September 11 attacks. Bono ended the song by opening up his jacket, the inside of which displayed the American flag.\n\nFor The Rolling Stones, the stage was in the form of the group's iconic tongue logo (John Pasche's \"Cunning Linguist\" first used in 1971 on their \"Sticky Fingers\" album). It was the largest stage ever assembled for a Super Bowl halftime show, with 28 separate pieces assembled in five minutes by a 600-member volunteer stage crew. The group performed three songs: \"Start Me Up,\" \"Rough Justice,\" and \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\" The show was viewed by 89.9 million people, more than the audiences for the Oscars, Grammys and Emmy Awards combined. In the wake of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy with Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake, ABC and the NFL imposed a five-second delay and censored lyrics considered too sexually explicit in the first two songs by briefly turning off Mick Jagger's microphone—censoring to which the group had previously agreed.\nHowever, the choice of The Rolling Stones sparked controversy in the Detroit community because the band did not represent the traditional Detroit \"Motown Sound,\" and no artists from the area were included.\n\n"}

The narrator is a visitor who believes there must be a rational explanation, but he finds it increasingly difficult to explain what is going on when the town's mysterious 8-foot statue is missing from its base and he sees what looks like the statue itself running through the night, carrying a cloth garotte.\n\nRecruiting a friend to help him, the narrator leads a group to find the statue before it kills again. A volunteer is killed, but the narrator shoots at the statue, which disappears into a lake. Things look hopeless until the narrator consults the private journal of the Colonel who brought the statue from India. He learns of a secret catch in the statue's base which lowers and raises it, and which allows entry into a secret passage. Someone has been living inside the secret passage, and at its end, where the tunnel reaches the lake, he sees what appears to be another statue in the water. As he tries to pull it out, he realizes that it is an enormous \"Hindoo\" (Hindu) high priest wearing a white gown and a mask to imitate the statue; the bullets in fact did reach their mark and the mysterious man is dead. He was a \"high priest\" who had come to avenge the destruction of his temple.\n\nThis story was first published in 1907 in \"Blue Book Magazine\".\n\nCrowning the heights on the outskirts of a certain town on the east coast is a large, iron water-tank from which an isolated row of small villas obtains its supply. The top of this tank has been cemented, and round it have been placed railings, thus making it a splendid \"look-out\" for any of the townspeople who may choose to promenade upon it. And very popular it was until the strange and terrible happenings of which I have set out to tell.\n\nThe \"strange and terrible happenings\" begin with the discovery of a murder victim on the tank; he died by strangulation. The strangled man is the father of the narrator's fiancee, which leads to the narrator's involvement in the story. A local man named Dr. Tointon has been investigating; he has found that the strangled man's watch and watch chain are missing. The narrator notices that the mud around the tank is undisturbed, indicating that no one passed that way.\n\nNo real progress is made until several days later when a policeman who had been patrolling the tank is also found dead; he has been strangled as well. Although witnesses heard the man die, and would have seen anyone leaving the tank via the stairs, the mud beside the tank remains undisturbed. Tointon tells the narrator that he has not yet formed a conclusion, but will speak to him the following day.\n\nThe next day comes, but Tointon sends the narrator a note asking him to delay their meeting until late that evening. While waiting, the narrator questions Dufirst, the tank-keeper, a bearded black man whom he considers \"an ugly little beast.\" In Dufirst's cottage the narrator discovers the first strangled man's missing watch and watch chain. The narrator summons the nearby police inspector and has Dufirst arrested. Later that evening we learn that the doctor is still out of town and has become seriously ill.\n\nIn the weeks that follow, Dufirst is tried and convicted of the first murder and scheduled for hanging. When Dr. Tointon recovers and returns, he is shocked to learn what has happened, believing that Dufirst is innocent. He assembles a team to investigate the water-tank that evening, bringing along a police constable, a loaded shotgun and several lanterns. Covering the lanterns, they hold a silent vigil on top of the tank. In the dead of night, a \"very slight, slurring, crawling sort of noise\" is heard. The lanterns are uncovered, and the doctor fires his shotgun.\n\nThe constable is found lying on the tank, but he is not dead—he has simply fainted from fright. The perpetrator is a \"writhing yellow something, like an eel or a snake... flat as a ribbon.\" This creature has emerged from the tank, via a pipe, and climbed up onto the railing around the tank. The doctor's belief is confirmed; we learn that when he investigated the original crime he discovered slime on the tank railings and moisture on the collars of the victims. The exact nature of the creature remains a mystery, as its head has been destroyed by the shotgun blast, but the doctor believes that it is an abnormal creature because it developed under \"abnormal conditions.\"\n\nThis story was first published in 1911 in \"Everybody's Weekly\"\n\nA ship is transporting a valuable cargo of gold bullion packed into chests, and stored in a separate locked and sealed room. But when mysterious whispering is heard in the night, an investigation leads the first mate to think he is losing his mind; first chests are missing, and then they aren't!\n\nThe narrator, who is the ship's second mate, is aboard \"one of the fast clipper-ships running between London and Melbourne at the time of the big gold finds up at Bendigo.\" The captain, named Reynolds, complains to him of a strange whispering in his cabin, and asks if the second mate will trade cabins with him. The previous captain, Captain Avery, had previously died in the room, of no known cause. Although the second mate agrees to the switch, believing the captain's concern to be nonsense, in a few nights he is hearing a mysterious whispering as well. The ship carries a very valuable cargo of gold bullion, so the mate gives orders to open and examine the special compartment holding the gold, which is positioned just below the captain's cabin in the lazarette. He awakens the captain, and they enter the lazarette and examine the compartment. The whispering can clearly be heard, but again the source of it cannot be found. The second mate and captain open the sealed room, and find that the thirteenth of the sixty chests is missing! However, when the captain leaves and returns with the purser, and they examine the chests again, they are all present and accounted for. No explanation can be found.\n\nA round-the-clock guard is set up. The three officers (the captain and the two mates) take turns sleeping inside the bullion compartment itself, locked in with the gold, while the petty officers keep watch, pacing around the bullion compartment twenty-four hours a day. The guard inside the room is woken every hour to confirm that the chests are all there. When it is time for the narrator to stand guard, he awakens groggily to discover that a number of chests are missing, but believes that he must be dreaming. When he awakens, the chests are all in place. Shortly thereafter, the first mate actually dies during his watch, again of no apparent cause. No explanation can be found, although the strange whispering is heard again.\n\nAfter the ship docks in London, bank officials come on board to remove the gold. Everything seems normal, and the watch is in place, but when the door into the bullion compartment is opened, the first mate on guard inside is found to be dead, again of no apparent cause. When the bullion is removed, all seems in order, until the bank reports that all of the chests actually contain lead! As additional cargo is unloaded, an especially heavy case arouses the second mate's suspicion, and he has the man operating the crane \"accidentally\" drop a case. It bursts open, and chests of gold bullion are found. An elaborate plot is revealed, in which conspirators brought aboard identical chests containing lead, stored in other cargo; the special compartment to hold the bullion was built with a sliding door and connection to a secret passage. In the dead of night the thieves gradually swapped the chests. To avoid detection by the guard inside the compartment they used a narcotic gas. Too low a dose allowed the second mate to awaken and see the chests missing; but too high a dose killed the first mate. The same narcotic gas evidently killed the previous captain, who was gassed to keep him from learning too much about the theft going on directly beneath his cabin.\n\nThis story was first published in 1911 in the \"Grand Magazine\".\n\nA yacht comes perilously close to colliding with a swamped, dismasted, derelict vessel; only the captain's instincts prevent the crash, as he sees a flash of light in the darkness. The source of the light cannot be found, but the yacht's spotlight picks out the derelict. Investigating the vessel, the crew of the yacht decides to tow it, in order to collect money for salvage. They arrange a tow-line, and leave a skeleton crew of four volunteers, together with the bo'sun, aboard. A little later, the captain of the yacht is shocked to discover that the towline is no longer connected and the ship is a considerable distance from the yacht. The crewmen aboard the vessel are gone.\n\nThe same scenario plays out again; the second mate leads another group of volunteers, but the line is again found disconnected and the men gone. No explanation is found. The yacht keeps a close watch on the ship all night, and in the morning the crew again boards the derelict and inspects it thoroughly. A half-dozen armed men are left aboard, this time under the direction of the third officer. At dusk the mate's whistle is heard, and there is a loud shouting from the derelict, but by the time the crew of the yacht investigates again, the men are gone.\n\nFinally, the crew of the yacht set up an iron-barred cage on the deck of the derelict, with a group of armed men inside, and they hold a vigil while the yachts hover expectantly nearby, ready to turn their spotlight on the derelict. In the dead of night a strange noise is heard, and the men in the cage fire a gun. The yacht trains its spotlight squarely onto the derelict ship, and the men are astonished to see that the rigging of the derelict ship is full of pirates. In the ensuing gun battle, all the pirates are killed. The derelict is not really flooded; while the upper part of the hold is filled with water and floating timber, it has been retrofitted with an airtight compartment underneath, accessible through the hollow lower masts, and is complete with electric lights, ventilation fans, and motive power. The lost men are found below, bound in chains but unharmed amidst a king's ransom in stolen gold.\n\nThis story was first published in 1911 in \"The Red Magazine\".\n\nAnother floating derelict is the subject of an investigation because of a mysterious tapping. A brave (or foolhardy) man bets that he can spend the night aboard the allegedly haunted ship. Is the tapping noise produced by the ghosts of the men who drowned when it sank, or is there a more prosaic explanation?\n\nWe learn that the iron ship \"Glen Doon\" \"turned turtle\" (flipped upside-down) and trapped ten workers aboard. For twenty-four hours the ship floated upside-down. The tapping of the workers' hammers on the hull led rescuers to attempt to drill holes in the ship, but this just allowed the air to escape faster, and the men were drowned as the ship sank.\n\nSeven months later, the ship was bought at auction and raised, although she then sat idle for another five years. No living soul is aboard her, but in the dead of night mysterious tapping can be heard, allegedely the ghosts of the drowned men. Larry Chaucer, the young son of a wealthy local, wagers that he can spend the night alone aboard the ship unmolested.\n\nHe and a number of his friends first climb aboard and investigate; aside from some silt, the ship appears completely empty, yet the faint tapping can be heard, although its precise source cannot be located. As they inspect the ship the tapping ceases. The men withdraw to a boat near the ship and to the dock to listen for trouble, leaving Chaucer aboard to perform his vigil. As they wait, the tapping sound resumes, audible even across the bay. Suddenly the firing of a pistol is heard, and then a scream. The men race for the ship, but the young daredevil can't be found. Only his empty pistol and his lantern remain. As the men explore the hold, a strange sound is heard, as if someone were ascending through the stillness of the hold, but no one can be seen. The men hastily leave the hold.\n\nDays pass, and the police investigate in excruciating detail; Larry Chaucer's wealthy father is involved. The ship is emptied completely; the silt is removed, and the internal bulkheads are removed until the \"Glen Doon\" is little more than an iron shell. Nothing is found. Police officers keep watch on board, and patrol-boats are stationed near the hulk, looking for any clue, as fruitless weeks pass. One night the hammering sound starts again, and as armed detectives keep watch on the deck they see:\n\n...a man's head and face, the hair as long as a woman's, and dripping with sea water, so that the cadaverous face showed white and unwholesome from out of the sopping down-hang of the hair. In a minute there followed the body of the strange man, and the sea water ran from his garments, glistening as the moon-breams caught the drops. He came inboard over the rail, making no more noise than a shadow, and paused, swaying with a queer movement full in a patch of moonlight. Then, noiseless, he seemed to glide across the deck in the direction of the dark gape of the open main hatchway.\n\nAlthough the men try to stop him, and fire at him, the figure disppears into the hold, and no trace of him can be found. Investigation continues. Mechanics are hired to drill holes into the sides of the ship, demonstrating that there are no secret compartments. They even drill into the bottom of the ship, patching the holes with hot lead to prevent the ingress of water. The hollow steel lower masts are investigated as well, and found to be empty. The search looks hopeless until the police inspector discovers a single hair stuck in a nearly invisible metal seam in a hollow mast. A secret door into the mast is discovered and opened. At the bottom of the hollow mast, a secret passage is found, leading down into a shaft that opens into another vessel, made from discarded boilers welded together, suspended below the \"Glen Doon\". In it is a band of counterfeiters stamping coins; this is the source of the mysterious tapping. The miscreants are apprehended. Larry Chaucer presumably met his death at the hands of the counterfeiters.\n\nThis story was first published in 1912 in \"The Red Magazine\".\n\nMr. Jock Danplank, a British citizen who has spent time living in the United States, has come into a substantial inheritance that includes not only money but a cottage complete with gardening and housekeeping staff and a stunningly beautiful garden. But Danplank's deceased uncle neglected to tell anyone just where the money was to be found. Near death, he was heard to mutter \"seventy-seven feet due east\", but was unable to finish his instructions.\n\nDanplank and his wife, Mary, take possession of the cottage and examining a large, ornate desk, attached to the floor, that was also part of the bequest. During the days and nights that follow, it becomes clear that Danplank's cousin is also trying to locate the money; he repeatedly invades the cottage grounds and angers the aged head gardener by trampling on the flower-beds; he even digs enormous pits on the grounds in the dead of night.\n\nAs the story reaches its climax Danplank and his wife arrange a surprise for the cousin. They silently observe him tampering with the ornate table in the cottage, and afterwards, while he and his confederates are digging another deep pit in the gardens, fill the pit with water and photograph him clambering out, covered with mud. The cousin's examinations have given them a clue, and they discover that by putting the table back in its original position they are able to use the compass rose in the desktop to locate the treasure. The story ends with another common Hodgson motif: a snide letter to the cousin, enclosing proofs of the photographs (for potential blackmail or criminal prosecution) and indicating that the treasure has been found.\n\nHodgson may have intended to introduce Jock Danplank as another recurring character. However, he did not use Danplank again. Sam Moskowitz in his introduction to the story collection \"Out of the Storm\" writes that the plot \"...provides an inconsequential bit of fiction, interesting only for the clever utilization of photography in the story.\" (Hodgson was a noted photographer).\n\nThis story was first published in 1917 in \"The Red Magazine\".\n\nA mysterious murder has taken place. Because the victim was observed leaving a pub and then found dead nearby, only a minute later, having traversed only a short distance on an empty street with high walls on either side, police are baffled. The initial setup is presented as a locked room mystery, in which the murder appears impossible given the circumstances. Cobbler Juk, the uncle of the police officer investigating, is informally recruited, and turns out to be a talented amateur sleuth. A second murder takes place, this time of Saddler Atkins.\n\nThe cobbler believes that he knows who will be killed next, and so he and his nephew the police officer stake out the home of Councillor Tomkins, waiting. What they see is quite baffling: a seven-foot creature, emitting disturbing, inhuman noises, observes the councillor, then crashes through a window and attacks him, with the cobbler and constable giving chase. The creature escapes, but Tomkins is dead.\n\nWe next join the cobbler in surveillance of a black man, whom they accost outside his home. He fights off the cobbler; in his home the cobbler finds an object, which is not revealed to the reader.\n\nIn the conclusion the cobbler explains the whole story: he has uncovered evidence that the three dead men worked together, many years ago, on a ship that was apparently involved in illegal seal poaching. The black man worked for the three, and to guarantee his silence the three cut out his tongue. The black man has been working his revenge, wearing a costume in the shape of a seal head. The cobbler tracked the man by an idiosyncratic habit: while waiting for his victims, he drops the matches that he uses to light his pipe, after tearing them in two and twisting them in a distinct manner. These twisted half-matches were found at the first two crime scenes and also in the floor-sweepings from a local pub.\n\nThis story was first published in 1918 in \"The Red Magazine\".\n\nCaptain Dan himself is a very colorful character who speaks in a mixture of nautical argot and gutter French.\n\nThis story was first published in 1925 in \"Argosy-Allstory Weekly\".\n\nA sea captain named Mellor is carrying out trading in a seaport on the Adriatic coast; the seaport is involved in \"the wars so common in the Balkans.\" Mortar and rifle fire is audible in the distance, but Captain Mellor is more disturbed to hear the horrible sounds of a mass execution of twenty minors, who had been fighting as irregular guerilla warriors, in the town square. Twenty more youths remain locked in the local jail awaiting execution the next morning. Mellor, pretending to support the executions and displaying little sympathy for the youths, gets a tour from a Frenchman. Mellor observes the pitiful condition of the prisoners, and watches as a guard puts out a cigarette against one boy's leg; he also learns the layout of the jail building and the location and number of the guards.\n\nThat night, Mellor leads a daring raid. A cliff edge lies behind and above the jail, and with his chief engineer George and two other crewmen, in the dark of night they put into place a spar and pulley to lower the captain and his chief engineer to the jail window. While they are nearly caught, with the help of the boys they manage to remove the window bars with a hacksaw; the boys kill one guard with one of the bars, and the captain manages to incapacitate two others. The boys are removed through the window and spirited away aboard Mellor's ship. The Frenchman never learns by what means the boys have miraculously disappeared, although he remains appalled by Mellor's outward cavalier attitude, telling him \"the good God was kinder than you.\"\n\nThe story was first published in 1975 in the collection \"Out of the Storm\" edited by Sam Moskowitz.\n\nA young seaman on board the \"Lady Shannon\", discussing Captain Teller and his cruelty and violent tendencies, encourages the other seamen to stand up to the man. Overhearing the discussion are three apprentices. The fate of another seaman, Toby, at the hands of the captain and second mate is revealed:\n\n\"Last trip they treated one of the ordinaries so badly that the poor chap went queer -- silly. Mind you, he acted like a goat and gave both the second mate and the skipper slack; but they knocked all that out of him and some of his brains as well, I believe. Anyway, he went half-dotty before the end of the voyage.\"\n\nA few days later, Seaman Jones, a vocal advocate of standing up for himself, bites off a plug of tobacco and is noticed by the second mate. He refuses to throw his tobacco overboard and the mate attacks him. They fight, and Jones severely injures the mate. The captain begins shouting and firing his revolver, although he only wounds one man by accident. The first mate also attacks Jones; in the fracas, the captain throws his revolver and accidentally strikes the first mate, who is knocked unconscious. One of the apprentices, Tommy, involuntarily shouts \"Hurray!\" and is attacked by the captain, who beats him, knocking him unconscious. Jones meanwhile attacks the second mate, and is also knocked unconscious, while the first mate has recovered. At the end of the complicated fracas Tommy, the second mate, and Jones are all unconscious. The second mate recovers with the administration of whiskey.\n\nTwo nights later, Jones is still only semi-conscious. As the second mate keeps watch, he abruptly screams and falls; he is found to be dead of a stab wound, although the weapon and the source of the attack are unknown; the attack seemed to come out of nowhere, right under the captain's watchful eye. The captain is deeply disturbed, and musters the entire crew for inspection. Everyone is present and accounted for, except Jones and Tommy. We learn that, in the opinion of the first mate, Jones is near death, and the apprentice Tommy is also still too badly injured to have committed the murder. The captain and the first mate are baffled, and become suspicious that the cause was supernatural.\n\nThe next day the captain becomes hopelessly drunk; the first mate disposes of the second mate's body, and repeatedly checks on the state of seaman Jones. The first mate goes on watch that evening. During his watch, he sends an older sailor repeatedly to check on Jones; at 2:30 a.m., the seaman reports that Jones has died. A disturbing grating sound is immediately heard, and the first mate, his imagination working overtime, becomes agitated, believing Jones' ghost may be coming for him. We learn that Tommy is also doing poorly, which only adds the mate's fears.\n\nThat evening, the captain and the mate keep watch together. After the moonrise, a \"strange husky inhuman gurgle\" is heard from the bridge, and a \"low, incredible, abominable laughter.\" The mate panics, screaming \"he's come for me!\" and running to the bridge; he is suddenly stabbed. A figure comes at the captain: \"something white and slender that ran upon the captain noiselessly.\" The captain, panicked, crashes into the steel side of the deck-house and is knocked unconscious. The figure vanishes overboard, apparently without a splash.\n\nIn the aftermath, we learn that the white figure was Toby, the ordinary seaman, who had been \"hazed to the verge of insanity by the brutality of the captain and the officers on the previous voyage.\" He was covered with flour, and apparently had been living as a stowaway in among the cargo; he had stabbed the officers from a vantage point hidden in a ventilator. In conclusion, the story tells us that\n\nTommy regained his health, as did both Captain Jeller and Jacob, the mate; but as a \"hardcase\" skipper and a \"buck-o-mate\", they are no longer shining examples.\n\nThis story was first published in 1988 in chapbook form as \"The Way of the Heathen.\"\n\nThis is considered by some editors such as Jeremy Lassen to be one of Hodgson's finest short stories. It features a remarkable crew of aged sailors who seem to have been at sea for decades; even the one they call the \"boy\" is fifty years old.\n\nFirst published in the American pulp magazine \"Adventure. \"\nAn albatross is captured on a ship and a message is found tied to it which tells of a water-logged boat where a woman is alone with a ship full of rats.

{"id": "2364282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2364282", "title": "Maurice Barrymore", "text": "Maurice Barrymore\n\nHerbert Arthur Chamberlayne Blythe (21 September 1849 – 25 March 1905), known professionally by his stage name Maurice Barrymore, was an India-born British stage actor. He was the patriarch of the Barrymore acting family, father of John, Lionel and Ethel, and great-grandfather of actress Drew.\n\nBorn Herbert Arthur Chamberlayne Blythe in Amritsar, India, he was the son of William Edward Blythe (1818–1873), a surveyor for the British East India Company, and his wife Charlotte Matilda Chamberlayne de Tankerville (1822–1849) who had some French descent. Herbert, the youngest of seven had an older brother named Will and two sisters named Emily and Evelin. Three other siblings had died in infancy. Matilda, after a difficult pregnancy, died shortly after giving birth to Herbert on 21 September 1849. In his formative years Herbert was raised by his Aunt Amelia Blythe, his mother's sister, and later by other family members. Amelia, a Chamberlayne by birth, had married a brother of Herbert's father and was a Blythe by marriage. Herbert was sent back to England for education at Harrow School, and studied Law at Oxford University, where he was captain of his class football team in 1868. Herbert also became enamored of the sport of boxing. The Marquess of Queensberry Rules were firmly established at this time but it wasn't unusual to see bare knuckle fights. On 21 March 1872 Herbert won the middleweight boxing championship of England. Years later many of Herbert's friends would be sports figures of the day, particularly boxers and wrestlers such as William Muldoon, John L. Sullivan, James J. Corbett and a young actor named Hobart Bosworth, the latter of whom Herbert would stage in an amateur bout with his son Lionel. Herbert's father expected him to become a barrister, but Herbert fell in with a group of actors, which scandalized the elder Blythe. That same year 1872 Herbert sat for his first posed theatrical photographic portrait by noted photographer Oliver Sarony, an older brother of the better remembered Napoleon Sarony. In order to spare his father the \"shame\" of having a son in such a \"dissolute\" vocation, he took the stage name Maurice Barrymore (though he never legally changed from \"Blythe\"), inspired by a conversation he had with fellow actor Charles Vandenhoff about William Barrymore (1759–1830), an early 19th-century English thespian, after seeing a poster depicting Barrymore in the Haymarket Theatre. He wanted his first name to be pronounced in the French manner (môr-ĒS) instead of the English (MÔR-is). His friends avoided that altogether by simply calling him \"Barry\".\n\nOn 29 December 1874, Barrymore emigrated to the United States, sailing aboard the SS \"America\" to Boston, and joined Augustin Daly's troupe, making his début in \"Under the Gaslight\".\n\nHe made his Broadway début in December 1875 in \"Pique\" opposite Emily Rigl; in the cast was a young actress, Georgiana Drew, known as Georgie. Maurice and Georgiana had been introduced earlier by her brother John Drew Jr. who had befriended Maurice when he first arrived in America. After a brief courtship, Barrymore and Georgie married on 31 December 1876, and had three children: Lionel (born 1878), Ethel (born 1879), and John (born 1882). While their parents were on tour, the children lived with Georgiana's mother in Philadelphia. Maurice also owned a farm on Staten Island to keep his collection of exotic animals. Georgiana died 2 July 1893, from consumption. For a summer in 1896, Lionel and John were left on the farm in the care of the man who fed the animals. Barrymore remarried exactly one year after Georgie's death to Mamie Floyd, much to Ethel's consternation. During his career, Maurice Barrymore played opposite many of the reigning female stars of the time including Helena Modjeska, Mrs. Fiske, Mrs. Leslie Carter, Olga Nethersole, Lillian Russell, and Lily Langtry.\n\nOn 19 March 1879, in Marshall, Texas, Barrymore and fellow actor Ben Porter were shot by a notorious gunfighter and bully named Jim Currie. Barrymore and Porter had played cards earlier with Currie, winning some money from him. That evening, while Barrymore, Porter and the actress Ellen Cummins dined at the White House Saloon, an intoxicated Currie began insulting and goading them into a fight. Barrymore challenged Currie to a fistfight. Currie shot him in the chest and then shot Porter in the stomach. John Drew, Jr., also with the company, showed up at the doorway after being alerted by all the commotion but Currie didn't shoot him. Porter was killed, while doctors spent the night operating on Barrymore to save his life. Georgie, then several months pregnant with Ethel, rushed to Texas to be at her husband's side enduring a long train trip. He made a full recovery, and returned to Marshall for the legal procedures that followed. Currie's brother was Andrew Currie, mayor of Shreveport, Louisiana, from 1878 to 1890 and later a member of the Louisiana state legislature, who apparently used his influence to secure a not guilty verdict (after a 10-minute deliberation). An enraged Barrymore vowed never to return to Texas.\n\nAccording to a 2004 A&E \"Biography\" piece, after the Ben Porter tragedy, Barrymore asked Georgiana to tour with him and Helena Modjeska in a play he had written. Georgiana and the children had converted to Roman Catholicism under Helena's influence. Learning that he and Helena had resumed their romance, Georgiana, who had been given ownership of the play by Barrymore, forced his hand by closing it. Helena's husband, its producer, sued her. The real reason for Georgiana's actions never got into the press. However, Barrymore's many dalliances did make the newspapers.\n\nIn 1884, Barrymore wrote a play titled \"Nadjezda\" (meaning \"hope\"). During this period he sailed with his wife Georgiana and their children Lionel, Ethel and John, then respectively 6, 5 and 2, to England to visit relatives he hadn't seen since migrating to America. (He had inherited some money from his aunt Amelia, one of his family members who helped raise him.) During the trip Barrymore met the great French actress and star Sarah Bernhardt. Without copyrighting his play, he gave her a copy of the manuscript. In 1886, Victorien Sardou wrote his play \"La Tosca,\" which later achieved great fame as an opera. Barrymore claimed that Bernhardt had given his play to Sardou and that \"La Tosca\" plagiarized it, and sought an injunction to stop Fanny Davenport from putting on further performances. In affidavits read out in court Bernhardt said that she had never seen the play and knew nothing about it, and Sardou said that preliminary material for the play had been in his desk for fifteen years. In fact, the only resemblance to \"La Tosca\" is the unholy bargain the heroine makes to save her husband's life, similar to that of Tosca and Baron Scarpia. As Sardou pointed out in his affidavit, this plot device is a common one and had been notably used by Shakespeare in \"Measure for Measure.\"\n\nIn 1896, Barrymore became the first major Broadway star to headline in Vaudeville—a brave foray at the time that he and Georgie speculatively would have later made into motion pictures had they lived. In the 1895 theater season on Broadway he co-starred with Mrs. Leslie Carter in \"The Heart of Maryland\". In the 1899 season on Broadway he had a success playing opposite Mrs. Fiske in the part of Rawdon Crawley in \"Becky Sharp\". This play was based on a character from William Thackeray's novel \"Vanity Fair\". \"Becky Sharp\" was Barrymore's last Broadway success. In 1900, Barrymore toured the U.S. with a play called \"The Battle of the Strong\" co-starring a young Holbrook Blinn. In the company of this play was a five-year-old child actress, Blanche Sweet, who grew up to be a silent movie actress and acted with Lionel in his first film. When the \"Battle of the Strong\" company stopped in Louisville, Kentucky Barrymore sat for his last posed photograph. Also during this time he got to spend time with his son John, who was now in his late teens. Lionel and Ethel were on the road in theater companies, having already started their careers.\n\nOn 28 March 1901, Barrymore was performing at the Lion Palace Theatre in New York when he suddenly departed from his monologue and shocked the audience with what was described as \"a blasphemous attack on the Jews\" and a rant of \"such an emotional pitch that tears rolled down his face.\" After further erratic behavior, Barrymore was committed to Bellevue Hospital by a court order obtained by his son. \nIn reporting his death on 25 March 1905, \"The New York Times\" recalled that \"He was playing a vaudeville engagement [in 1901] at a Harlem theatre when he suddenly dropped his lines and began to rave\". The following day he became violent and was taken to Bellevue insane ward by his son, John, who lured him under the pretense of starring in a new play. At Bellevue and later Amityville he was diagnosed with the lingering effects of syphilis, an incurable disease in his day. During his stay at Bellevue he almost strangled his daughter Ethel when she paid a visit to him. Ethel, through her early success on the stage, would pay for her father's stay in the institutions. A trained boxer, Barrymore's strength remained, as in a scuffle with one of the Bellevue attendants, he picked the man up over his head and threw him into a corner. In 1905 his son Lionel visited him at Amityville and the subject of San Francisco came up. Maurice called Lionel a \"goddamned liar\" and stated that San Francisco had been destroyed by fire and earthquake. Lionel writing in his autobiography says his father had foreseen the great 1906 earthquake a full year before it took place. Maurice died at Amityville in his sleep, and Ethel had him buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Philadelphia. When the cemetery was later closed his remains were moved to Mount Vernon Cemetery, also in Philadelphia, where his first wife and her family are buried. Barrymore was fondly remembered and his death was widely reported in the country's newspapers. Barrymore had lived long enough to see all three of his children grow to adulthood and enter the family business of acting.\n\nIn honor of his life, Michael J. Farrand penned the memorial narrative poem \"The Man Who Brought Royalty to America\" in 2000, based on the definitive biography \"Great Times, Good Times: The Odyssey of Maurice Barrymore\" by James Kotsilibas Davis (Doubleday, 1977).\n\n"}
{"id": "1558077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1558077", "title": "Moon landing", "text": "Moon landing\n\nA Moon landing is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon. This includes both manned and unmanned (robotic) missions. The first human-made object to reach the surface of the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 mission, on 13 September 1959.\n\nThe United States' Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969. There have been six manned U.S. landings (between 1969 and 1972) and numerous unmanned landings, with no soft landings happening from 22 August 1976 until 14 December 2013.\n\nTo date, the United States is the only country to have successfully conducted manned missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972.\n\nAfter the unsuccessful attempt by the Luna 1 to land on the Moon in 1959, the Soviet Union performed the first hard (unpowered) Moon landing later that same year with the Luna 2 spacecraft, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with Ranger 4. Since then, twelve Soviet and U.S. spacecraft have used braking rockets to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface, between 1966 and 1976. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna 9 and Luna 13 missions. The U.S. followed with five unmanned Surveyor soft landings.\n\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first unmanned lunar soil sample return with the Luna 16 probe on 24 September 1970. This was followed by Luna 20 and Luna 24 in 1972 and 1976, respectively. Following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first Lunokhod, Luna E-8 No.201, the Luna 17 and Luna 21 were successful unmanned lunar rover missions in 1970 and 1973.\n\nMany missions were failures at launch. In addition, several unmanned landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful, including: Luna 15, Luna 18, and Luna 23 all crashed on landing; and the U.S. Surveyor 4 lost all radio contact only moments before its landing.\n\nMore recently, other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the Moon at speeds of around , often at precise, planned locations. These have generally been end-of-life lunar orbiters that, because of system degradations, could no longer overcome perturbations from lunar mass concentrations (\"masscons\") to maintain their orbit. Japan's lunar orbiter Hiten impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The European Space Agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter SMART-1 on 3 September 2006.\n\nIndian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indian Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter and performed remote sensing experiments during its descent to the lunar surface.\n\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1 executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission Chang'e 3 was launched on 1 December 2013 and soft-landed on 14 December.\n\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting on 20 July 1969 UTC, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 UTC with Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface.\n\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the Command Module. The last three missions had a rover for increased mobility.\n\nIn order to go to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave the gravity well of the Earth. The only practical way of accomplishing this currently is with a rocket. Unlike other airborne vehicles such as balloons or jets, a rocket is the only known form of propulsion which can continue to increase its speed at high altitudes in the vacuum outside the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about and be ruggedized to withstand a \"hard landing\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \"soft landing\" (which is the only viable option with human occupants). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard Moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in 1962 all failed. The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first unmanned soft lunar landing by the U.S.\n\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the escape velocity of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is . The change in velocity (referred to as a delta-v) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original launch vehicle as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on Titan carried out by the \"Huygens\" probe in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using atmospheric entry techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\n\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959. Crash landings may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been many such Moon crashes, often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V moon rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the Lunar Module were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the Moon.\n\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing. These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\n\nThe intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an unmanned and then ultimately a manned moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. World War II had introduced many new and deadly innovations including blitzkrieg-style surprise attacks used in the invasion of Poland and in the attack on Pearl Harbor; the V-2 rocket, a ballistic missile which killed thousands in attacks on London and Antwerp; and the atom bomb, which killed hundreds of thousands in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the hydrogen bomb.\n\nWilly Ley wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\". On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union launched \"Sputnik 1\" as the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and so initiated the Space Race. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes. Also, the steady beeping of the radio beacon aboard \"Sputnik 1\" as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides as effective propaganda to Third World countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet political system compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a solar orbit, the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon, and the first photography of the never-before-seen far side of the Moon. These were the Luna 1, Luna 2, and Luna 3 spacecraft.\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, NASA. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that would bridge the so-called missile gap and enable a policy of deterrence to nuclear war with the Soviets known as mutual assured destruction or MAD. These newly developed missiles were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\n\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure, just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \"Luna\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \"Sputnik\" or \"Cosmos\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\n\nIn contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in 1959, success eluded initial U.S. efforts to reach the Moon with the Pioneer and Ranger programs. Fifteen consecutive U.S. unmanned lunar missions over a six-year period from 1958 to 1964 all failed their primary photographic missions; however, Rangers 4 and 6 successfully repeated the Soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions.\n\nFailures included three U.S. attempts in 1962 to hard land small seismometer packages released by the main Ranger spacecraft. These surface packages were to use retrorockets to survive landing, unlike the parent vehicle, which was designed to deliberately crash onto the surface. The final three Ranger probes performed successful high altitude lunar reconnaissance photography missions during intentional crash impacts between .\n\nThree different designs of Pioneer lunar probes were flown on three different modified ICBMs. Those flown on the Thor booster modified with an Able upper stage carried an infrared image scanning television system with a resolution of 1 milliradian to study the Moon's surface, an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites, a magnetometer, and temperature-variable resistors to monitor spacecraft internal thermal conditions. The first, a mission managed by the United States Air Force, exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around and , far short of the roughly required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\n\nNASA then collaborated with the United States Army's Ballistic Missile Agency to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the Juno ICBM, carrying only photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger-Müller tube detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around , serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the Van Allen radiation belts before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than , twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a solar orbit.\n\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \"paddlewheel\" solar panels extending from a one-meter diameter spherical spin-stabilized spacecraft body that was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure magnetic fields, detect low frequency electromagnetic waves in space and use a sophisticated integrated propulsion system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its Atlas ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\n\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory embarked upon an unmanned spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as Mariners; lunar versions were Rangers. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\n\nThe Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical. Spacecraft experiments included a Lyman-alpha telescope, a rubidium-vapor magnetometer, electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range particle detectors, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating ionization chamber, cosmic dust detectors, and scintillation counters. The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of and a perigee of .\n\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the magnetosphere over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth parking orbit after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\n\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States. All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1 m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650 mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of , and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5 m in diameter. This lander (code-named \"Tonto\") was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid freon. A 42 kg (56 pounds) metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere.\n\nThis payload sphere contained six silver-cadmium batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer that was designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\n\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds. Seconds before impact, at above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed here).\n\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface.\n\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior heat sterilization of the spacecraft by keeping it above the boiling point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.\n\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes. These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo manned Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While Ranger 6 suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent Ranger 7 mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\n\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the Ranger 7 mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the United States Congress intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo manned Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with Ranger 8 and Ranger 9 further buoyed U.S. hopes.\n\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February, 1966. Airbags protected its ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over . Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.\n\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth. It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\n\nIn 1970 and 1973 two Lunokhod (\"Moonwalker\") robotic lunar rovers were delivered to the Moon, where they successfully operated for 10 and 4 months respectively, covering 10.5 km (Lunokhod 1) and 37 km (Lunokhod 2). These rover missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions.\n\nThe U.S. robotic Surveyor program was part of an effort to locate a safe site on the Moon for a human landing and test under lunar conditions the radar and landing systems required to make a true controlled touchdown. Five of Surveyor's seven missions made successful unmanned Moon landings. Surveyor 3 was visited two years after its Moon landing by the crew of Apollo 12. They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.\n\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with unmanned spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming manned landers with their much greater weight.\n\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a -per-hour ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned -per-hour impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a manned flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\n\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before manned spacecraft could follow unmanned ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all utilized flight paths from Earth that traveled directly to the lunar surface without first placing the spacecraft in a lunar orbit. Such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for unmanned spacecraft on a one-way trip.\n\nIn contrast, manned vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile for a manned Moon landing.\n\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions which featured lunar orbit operations as a necessary prerequisite to a manned Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial unmanned orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of manned landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\n\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's maria. Such mass concentrations (\"mascons\") can send a manned mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\n\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA Lunar Prospector orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume that would be detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist Eugene Shoemaker was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor – currently the only human remains on the Moon.\n\nLuna 10 became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\n\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so that it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called free return trajectory. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a manned circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges above and beyond those found in a manned low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a manned Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\n\nManned Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around . Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around . The g-loading on astronauts during the resulting deceleration can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\n\nAchieving a manned circumlunar loop flight prior to a manned lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their Zond spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were unmanned planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate manned program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a manned circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\n\nInitial manned spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet Vostok and U.S. Mercury programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as Voskhod effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten Gemini low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove critical techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking that were crucial to a manned lunar landing mission profile.\n\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviets Union began flying their second-generation Zond manned spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him immediately to Earth. The Zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational Proton launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet manned Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation Soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced N-1 booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a manned Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. manned lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\n\nLike Zond, Apollo Moon flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop in the event that a Service Module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit as planned. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which is the only manned circumlunar loop mission flown to date.\n\nZond 5 was the first spacecraft to carry life from Earth to the vicinity of the Moon and return, initiating the final lap of the Space Race with its payload of tortoises, insects, plants, and bacteria. Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both of these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to human crewmembers had they been aboard.\n\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue unmanned Zond tests until their reliability to support manned flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the lunar module, and because of CIA reports of a potential Soviet manned circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of Apollo 8 from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\n\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in Baikonur, giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. Cosmonauts went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first manned trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet Politburo decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a manned Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another unmanned test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\n\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. Apollo spacecraft had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The Apollo 8 mission carried out the first manned trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the Saturn V booster for manned use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. Apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a manned Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within altitude above the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module that was too overweight to allow a successful landing. With the failure of the unmanned Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna 15 in July 1969, the stage was set for Apollo 11.\n\nPlans for manned Moon exploration originated during the Eisenhower administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in \"Collier's\" magazine, Wernher von Braun had popularized the idea of a manned expedition to the Moon to establish a lunar base. A manned Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, atmospheric re-entry without ablative overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, von Braun promoted a plan for the United States Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\n\nAfter the early Soviet successes, especially Yuri Gagarin's flight, US President John F. Kennedy looked for a US project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President Lyndon Johnson to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the Third World. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the United States, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\n\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads, and consequently, rockets with smaller payload capacities. By comparison, Soviet nuclear weapons were much heavier, and the powerful R-7 rocket was developed to carry them. More modest potential missions such as flying around the Moon without landing or establishing a space lab in orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun) were determined to offer too much advantage to the Soviets, since the US would have to develop a heavy rocket to match the Soviets. A Moon landing, however, would capture world imagination while functioning as propaganda.\nJohnson had championed the US manned space program ever since the Sputnik scare, sponsoring the legislation which created NASA when he was in the Senate in 1958. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best manned space achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating the USSR to a manned lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. This last dismayed NASA's leader, James E. Webb, who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\n\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V launch vehicle, which achieved a perfect record of zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures, in thirteen launches.\n\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians on the left, who wanted more money spent on social programs, and on those on the right, who favored a more military project. By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson became President in 1963, his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy planned.\n\nSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said in October 1963 that the USSR was \"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\n\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. Sergey Korolev, the Soviet space program's chief designer, had started promoting his Soyuz craft and the N1 launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a manned Moon landing.\n\nKhrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a manned cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all manned projects under his direction.\n\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, the co-ordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for the mission that would have placed Aleksei Leonov on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a manned landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\n\nA program of automated return vehicles was begun, in the hope of being the first to return lunar rocks. This had several failures. It eventually succeeded with Luna 16. But this had little impact, because the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 lunar landings and rock returns had already taken place by then.\n\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of manned Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.\n\nUnlike other international rivalries, the Space Race has remained unaffected in a direct way regarding the desire for territorial expansion. After the successful landings on the Moon, the U.S. explicitly disclaimed the right to ownership of any part of the Moon.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon had speechwriter William Safire prepare a condolence speech for delivery in the event that Armstrong and Aldrin became marooned on the Moon's surface and could not be rescued.\n\nIn 1951, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke forecast that man would reach the Moon by 1978.\n\nOn 16 August 2006, the Associated Press reported that NASA is missing the original Slow-scan television tapes (which were made before the scan conversion for conventional TV) of the Apollo 11 Moon walk. Some news outlets have mistakenly reported that the SSTV tapes were found in Western Australia, but those tapes were only recordings of data from the Apollo 11 Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package.\n\nScientists believe the six American flags planted by astronauts have been bleached white because of more than 40 years of exposure to solar radiation. Using LROC images, five of the six American flags are still standing and casting shadows at all of the sites, except Apollo 11. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin reported that the flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during liftoff of Apollo 11.\n\nLaunched on 24 January 1990, 11:46 UTC. At the end of its mission, the Japanese lunar orbiter Hiten was commanded to crash into the lunar surface and did so on 10 April 1993 at 18:03:25.7 UT (11 April 03:03:25.7 JST).\n\nLunar Prospector was launched on 7 January 1998. The mission ended on 31 July 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a crater near the lunar south pole after the presence of water ice was successfully detected.\n\nLaunched 27 September 2003, 23:14 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. At the end of its mission, the ESA lunar orbiter SMART-1 performed a controlled crash into the Moon, at about 2 km/s. The time of the crash was 3 September 2006, at 5:42 UTC.\n\nSELENE or \"Kaguya\" was launched on 14 September 2007. After successfully orbiting the Moon for a year and eight months, the main orbiter was instructed to impact on the lunar surface near the crater Gill at 18:25 UTC on 10 June 2009.\n\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1, launched 24 October 2007, 10:05 UTC, executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009, 20:44 GMT, after a 16-month mission.\n\nChandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008, 00:52 UTC. The impactor, the Moon Impact Probe, impacted near Shackleton Crater at the south pole of the lunar surface at 14 November 2008, 20:31 IST. Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled for launch in 2019.\n\nThe LCROSS data collecting shepherding spacecraft was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on 18 June 2009 on board an Atlas V rocket with a Centaur upper stage. On 9 October 2009, at 11:31 UTC, the Centaur upper stage impacted the lunar surface, releasing the kinetic energy equivalent of detonating approximately 2 tons of TNT (8.86 GJ). Six minutes later at 11:37 UTC, the LCROSS shepherding spacecraft also impacted the surface.\n\nThe GRAIL mission consisted of two small spacecraft: GRAIL A (\"Ebb\"), and GRAIL B (\"Flow\"). They were launched on 10 September 2011 on board a Delta II rocket. GRAIL A separated from the rocket about nine minutes after launch, and GRAIL B followed about eight minutes later. The first probe entered orbit on 31 December 2011 and the second followed on 1 January 2012. The two spacecraft impacted the Lunar surface on 17 December 2012.\n\nLADEE was launched on 7 September 2013. The mission ended on 18 April 2014, when the spacecraft's controllers intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon, which, later, was determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.\n\nOn 14 December 2013 at 13:12 UTC Chang'e 3 soft-landed a rover on the Moon. This was the first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 on 22 August 1976.\n\nProgress in space exploration has recently broadened the phrase \"moon landing\" to include other moons in the Solar System as well. The \"Huygens\" probe of the \"Cassini–Huygens\" mission to Saturn performed a successful unmanned moon landing on Titan in 2005. Similarly, the Soviet probe Phobos 2 came within of performing an unmanned moon landing on Mars' moon Phobos in 1989 before radio contact with that lander was suddenly lost. A similar Russian sample return mission called Fobos-Grunt (\"grunt\" means \"soil\" in Russian) launched in November 2011, but stalled in low Earth orbit. There is widespread interest in performing a future moon landing on Jupiter's Europa moon to drill down and explore the possible liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface.\n\nChina is planning to land another rover and collect samples in the Chang'e 4 mission and return lunar soil samples by 2018 in the Chang'e 5 mission.\n\nISRO, the Indian National Space agency, is planning a second version of Chandrayaan named Chandrayaan 2. According to former ISRO Chairman G. Madhavan Nair, \"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) hopes to land two rovers – one Indian and another Russian – on the Moon in 2018, as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission. The rover will be designed to move on wheels on the lunar surface, pick up samples of soil or rocks, do on-site chemical analysis and send the data to the mother-spacecraft Chandrayaan II, which will be orbiting above. Chandrayaan II will transmit the data to Earth.\" The payloads have already been finalized. ISRO has mentioned that due to weight restrictions it will not be carrying any overseas payloads on this mission. The lander, named Vikram, is projected to weigh 1,250 kg, and the entire spacecraft will be launched by the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.\n\nRussia's Luna-Glob 1 is expected to be launched in 2018. In 2007 the head of the Russian Space Agency announced plans to send cosmonauts to the Moon by 2025 and establish a permanent robotically operated base there in 2027–2032. In 2015, Roscosmos stated that Russia plans to place a cosmonaut on the Moon by 2030, leaving Mars to NASA. The purpose is to work jointly with NASA and avoid another Space Race.\n\nThe Lunar Precursor Robotic Program (LPRP) was a program of robotic spacecraft missions which NASA will use to prepare for future Moon landings. Three orbiters have been launched in the program, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), and the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), launched in 2013, but no Moon landings are scheduled yet.\n\nThe Google Lunar X Prize competition offered a $20 million award for the first privately funded team to land a robotic probe on the Moon. Like the Ansari X Prize before it, the competition aimed to advance the state of the art in private space exploration. Of the several competing teams, Puli Space Technologies at one time (2012) planned to launch in 2014\nand Astrobotic Technology plans to launch in the second half of 2016 with their own rover plus another team's lunar rovers from Hakuto.\n\nIn 2019, a consortium of Vodafone, Audi and PT Scientists are planning a Moon landing. The mission is to launch a lander and two small rovers to the Moon from Cape Canaveral, Florida on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during the 50th-anniversary year of NASA's Apollo 11 Moon landing. Nokia will assist to setup a LTE network to manage lunar terrestrial communication system of the mission.\n\nMany conspiracy theorists hold that the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax; however, empirical evidence is readily available to show that manned Moon landings did occur. Anyone on Earth with an appropriate laser and telescope system can bounce laser beams off three retroreflector arrays left on the Moon by Apollo 11, 14 and 15, verifying deployment of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment at historically documented Apollo Moon landing sites and so proving equipment constructed on Earth was successfully transported to the surface of the Moon. In addition, in August 2009 NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter began to send back high resolution photos of the Apollo landing sites. These photos show not only the large Descent Stages of the lunar landers left behind but also tracks of the astronauts' walking paths in the lunar dust.\n\n\n"}

The text is a reworking by Voltaire of the Italian tragedy \"Merope\" (1713) by Scipione Maffei, dating from 1736/1737. The play premiered in 1743 and first appeared in print in 1744.\nScipione Maffei worked the classical story into his tragedy (it) \"\" in 1713. Voltaire met Maffei in Paris in 1733 and secured his agreement that it should be adapted into a French tragedy. Voltaire decided to premiere it only after the staging of his tragedy Mahomet, although he had completed work on it in 1737.\n\nThe action takes place at the court of Messene. The queen dowager Merope, mourning her murdered husband Cresphonte regards the newcomer Egisthe as responsible for the murder of her son, when in fact he is her long-lost son. He presents himself at court and eventually deposes and kills the tyrannical usurper Polyphonte, who had killed his father. Egisthe then installs Mérope as queen.\n\nThe play was put on at the Comédie-Française. After the premiere the audience called Voltaire onto the stage in front of the curtain - the first time this had ever happened in the history of French theatre. With 29 subsequent performances the play was a great success. It was also a commercial success, with receipts exceeding those of any previous play by Voltaire. \"Merope\" was revived in February and March the following year, attracting even larger audiences.\n\nThe first printed edition of the play was \"La Mérope Française, avec quelques petites pièces de Litterature\", Paris, Chez Prault fils, Libraire, Quai de Conty, vis-à-vis la descente du Pont-Neuf, à la Charitè, M. DCC. XLIV, 8°, XXIV (II), 116 (II), 16 S.\n\nWhen the play was printed Voltaire added a preface, \"Avis au lecteur\", in which he warned against pirate editions, and a letter of dedication to Scipione Maffei. The subtitle \"Pièces fugitives de littérature\" indicated that a number of other works were published together with the tragedy: \"Lettre sur l'esprit\", \"Nouvelles considérations sur l'histoire\" and \"Lettre à M. Norberg, chapelain du roy de Suède Charles XII, auteur de l`histoire de ce monarque\".\n\n\"Mérope\" was translated into English by Aaron Hill, who also translated other works by Voltaire, \"Zara\" (\"Zaire\") and \"Alzira \" (\"Alzire\") for the London stage. Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter translated the play into German in 1774.\n\n"}
{"id": "5438217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5438217", "title": "Rocket Mania!", "text": "Rocket Mania!\n\nRocket Mania! is a puzzle video game by Belgian studio Nuclide Games, published by PopCap Games.\n\nIn \"Rocket Mania\", players earn points by quickly and skillfully launching fireworks. This is done by rotating fuse segments on a grid in order to form a path between sources of flame on the left and firework rockets on the right. As the two are connected, the rockets launch, earning points. Bonus points can be earned by launching multiple rockets at once, which is possible since the fuse segments often contain 3-way or 4-way junction pieces, effectively splitting the path of the flame. After a rocket launch, all fuse segments which were touched by the flames are eliminated and replaced by new random fuse segments (with existing pieces falling downward to fill any gaps).\n\nConnections are helpfully color-coded in order to easily identify fuse segments which are connected to a source of fire or to one or more rockets. Players often find it helpful to work backwards (from the rockets), allowing setup of a multiple rocket launch before making connection with fuse segments already connected to flames.\n\nThe game features bonus items which randomly appear on various fuse segments. These include gems (worth extra points), bombs (which blow up all nearby fuses, but also any items), and clocks (which temporarily freeze the game countdown timer). These items are earned when the fuse segment they are placed upon is burned.\n\nCoins can be collected in the same fashion, and after each level, the coins are automatically spent to upgrade the point-value of some of the rockets, making future launches of these rockets more valuable. 5 coins upgrade one rocket, to a maximum of 1000 points, and for every upgrade the rockets take on new appearances, ultimately ending up as \"Dragon Rockets\". After all rockets have been fully upgraded (to level 10), every additional coin which is collected is converted into points.\n\nNew items are placed onto the existing fuse segments at a faster rate if the player successfully performs large, multi-rocket launches. Larger launches increase the number of coins that drop onto the fuses as well.\n\nIn addition to the \"classic\" mode, the game also includes an arcade mode, and a strategy mode. In the arcade mode, there is no time limit, but new fuse segments continuously fall from the top of the screen, filling up the available play area. Players can somewhat shift the position of falling pieces, but must otherwise quickly launch rockets to consume existing fuse segments. If any column of the board completely fills up, the game ends.\n\nIn the strategy mode, the player has only a limited number of matches, and the game ends when all of them have been used. New matches appear on the field whenever the player launches three or more rockets; these must be picked up within three moves by burning the fuse segments on which they appear. Since a single match can launch more than one rocket if the fuses are set up properly, it is to the player's advantage to launch as many as possible at the same time. This mode encourages slower, more deliberate play, with careful planning required in order to extend play time.\n\nThe online version of \"Rocket Mania\" can be played for free at MSN Games and various other websites, but is limited in levels and extras. The Windows version, \"Rocket Mania Deluxe\", is available as a trial download, with the full version able to be unlocked for a nominal fee.\n\nPalm OS and Pocket PC versions are also available.\n\nGameZone awarded the Windows version of the title a 9.2 (out of 10) and an \"Editor's Choice\" award, concluding that it is easy to pick up, addictive, and able to keep one entertained for hours. While the reviewer at GameZone enjoyed the way the difficulty level slowly ramped up, GameSpot felt that the game was a little too simple and that there wasn't any real challenge until the later levels. As such, GameSpot scored the title as only 6.7 (out of 10), although some positives aspects which were noted included an easy control scheme and a decent variety of modes.\n\nThe editors of \"Computer Gaming World\" nominated \"Rocket Mania\" for their 2003 \"Puzzle Game of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to \"Bookworm\". They wrote, \"From \"Bejeweled\" to \"Rocket Mania\" to \"Zuma\", PopCap has constantly found new ways to spell 'addiction.' \"\n"}

The company's policy encourages its staff to work from home. This has led to the development team becoming international in its composition, employing developers from ten different countries. The distribution of work tasks and discussion of progress is done virtually, through a private company forum.\n\nIn 2010, the company assembled a development team to begin work on their first title, \"\". The work done on the fan project that became the officially licensed remake of Duke Nukem 3D led to Interceptor being contracted to work on titles for multiple platforms including PC, XBLA, PSN and iOS.\n\nIn September 2011, after \"Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded\" was halted, Apogee Software contacted Interceptor Entertainment and the two companies conversed over the following months. In that time, the idea and contract for rebooting \"Rise of the Triad\" was made a reality and production started shortly afterwards. Development of their first major project, a remake of \"Rise of the Triad\" began in early 2012 and the game was released in July 2013.\n\nIn September and October 2013, Interceptor Entertainment moved its headquarters from Herning to Aalborg. The Interceptor virtual team had roughly 35 employees spread across 10 countries and several employees based at their headquarters in Aalborg. On March 3, 2014 it was announced that Interceptor Entertainment's part-owner Mike Nielsen's company SDN Invest had bought 3D Realms.\n\nInterceptor began work on a game called \"Duke Nukem: Mass Destruction\". However, due to a lawsuit by Gearbox Software, the game's name was changed to \"Bombshell\". The game was released on January 29, 2016.\n\nOn September 6, 2016, Interceptor and 3D Realms announced \"Rad Rodgers\", an action platformer game running on Unreal Engine 4 and starring the title character and his console-come-to-life friend Dusty (voiced by Jon St. John). The game was inspired by 1990s-era platformers. The studio started a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign with an aim of $50,000. The studio raised $81,861 in 30 days. The game is scheduled to release in February 2017.\n\nOn March 7, 2017, an update to Kickstarter backers was uploaded, titled \"The Future of Rad Rodgers\" explaining that the company was going to be restructured and renamed within the upcoming months.

Michael Buffer was the ring announcer and comedian John Pinette refereed the bouts. Then-\"Entertainment Tonight\" correspondent Paula McClure served as a reporter.\n\n\"The Grudge Match\" later was revived for British television, with Nick Weir and Lisa Rogers hosting and boxer Barry McGuigan as the referee.\n\nEach Grudge Match featured two people with a grievance to air out. A short video explaining the beef was played before each match. Each participant wore a uniform consisting of a helmet, T-shirt, shorts, and Chuck Taylor All-Stars of the same colour. One contestant wore red while the other blue. Prior to the bout, the competitors chose which of the implements they wanted to use during the three round match.\n\nEach Grudge Match had a title attached to it, relating to the grudge being carried. Both fighters were introduced with a nickname by Buffer, and Pinette explained the rules before each bout.\n\nSince the match took place in a boxing ring, it was treated as a boxing match. Each round was three minutes long. Only the referee could stop the fight, and the standard 8-count rule in boxing applied. After three rounds, the audience voted for the winner, which was announced by Buffer.\n\nThe two opponents try to get as many hits on each other's heads as possible with batakas. In some cases, to level the playing field due to the strength differences in the opponents, one opponent may have his or her shoes tied together and/or only have one bataka, while the other would have his or her shoes tied individually and have two batakas.\n\nThe two opponents have 3 minutes to throw as many stale doughnuts as possible and try to get the most hits.\n\nThe two opponents have 3 minutes to pelt each other with food items used in a salad bar.\n\nThe two contestants are dressed as cavemen and have 3 minutes to pelt one another with clubs.\n\nThe two opponents after the match (and sometimes interviews from Ventura) would hug or give a handshake to one another, and the winner got a bonus prize.\n\nCirca 2000, London Weekend Television made a British version of \"Grudge Match\" (which did not have the word \"the\" in its title), hosted by Nick Weir and Lisa Rogers, and featured former boxing champion Barry McGuigan as the referee. Instead of the typical challenges as seen on the US version, the challenges were more made in the style of \"Gladiators\", the show which \"Grudge Match\" replaced. The winner got a bonus prize, as in the US version, but the loser had to pay a forfeit. The prizes and forfeits were based on the storylines of the grudge. Occasionally Lisa would talk to audience members who were relatives and/or friends of the contenders prior to hearing about it from the contenders' perspectives. This show also ran just one series on weekends on ITV prime time.\n\nAll matches were best two out of three, and all rounds began and ended with a bell unless otherwise specified. Sometimes an airhorn signalled the end. Male contenders wore red and blue, and female contenders wore green and orange. UKGameshows.com reacted negatively to the version in their review, comparing it negatively in comparison to \"Gladiators\".\n\nThe two contenders are strapped to giant inflatable sumo wrestlers and try to knock each other down. Barry decides the winner.\n\nThe two contenders climb up a wall made of glass with rock climbing supports for the feet and try to grab a ball and attach it to a velcro wall. The first to grab 2 balls, attach them, and then ring the bell wins.\n\nThe two contenders swing across a pool on a rope and grab a ball to place in a smaller wading pool or container. The first to get 3 balls in the pool wins, and the loser gets dunked in the pool.\n\nThe contenders, both wearing specially designed sumo suits so that when they fall, people will have to help them back up, race to be the first to score 5 balls in the correct colour bucket. The contenders are allowed to impede the opponent by pushing or bumping them.\n\nThe two players have a rope attached to their back and must pull on another rope to make their way through the soapy sudded floor to grab a block and then toss it inside a basket to score. When letting go of the rope whether or not they have a block, they get \"twangoed\" (rapidly pulled) back to the start. If they drop a block onto the soapy floor, it doesn't count. The first one to score 4 blocks, or whoever has the most blocks when all are exhausted, wins.\n\nThe two players are placed inside what Barry describes as a \"giant, inflatable sausage,\" which is placed in the pool. They must run back and forth transporting balls from one end to the other, depositing them in an envelope. The trouble is that running back and forth in the inflatable sausage may cause contenders to lose their footing and struggle to keep it. The first to 5 balls wins.\n\nThe players must balance themselves using two tightropes above the pool, holding a ball in their mouths while going back to the other side. The first to transfer 2 balls across to the opposite velcro post wins, and the loser's rope becomes a lot less tight, getting them dunked into the pool (unless they fell into the pool already).\n\nBarry tosses a medicine ball into the air and the players wrestle for it, but they cannot bite, punch, or kick, or Barry may disqualify them. Their goal is to place the ball in the scoring pod, and the first to do it twice wins.\n\nThe two players begin in the pool and each have to climb a slide of their corresponding colour, using blocks scattered in the pool to get there. The blocks must stack up neatly to count, although the players can toss the blocks up to the ramp. The first to press the buzzer wins, and when doing so, activates a tank that dumps water onto the loser's slide and flushes away all the losing contender's blocks.\n\nThe contenders need not place blocks all the way to the top if they can reach the buzzer.\n\nThis was only used in a group grudge pitting teams of four against each other. Two players drive bumper cars around while trying to grab a huge ball that Barry throws into the middle of the arena to start to the game. The winner is the team with the most points when time is called, or the team that scores three points first.\n\nThe best two of three wins the game. Barry throws a large ball into the pool and the players have to throw it through a hula hoop.\n\nThis game involves the whole team and the whole arena, where the first to complete all four obstacles of the course is the winner, with each player taking on one obstacle. The first players do a swing on a rope over the pool from one net to another, and then cross a section of lily pads without falling in the water to the net. Falling in the water means the player has to go back and start from the second net again. When either player touches the net, the second section begins. A teammate cannot start their job, however, until the previous player finishes theirs.\n\nThe second section involves two players dressed in sumo gear (borrowed from the game \"Sumo Blitz\"), and the object is to pop five balloons first. The third section starts when one player pops all five.\n\nThe third section is crossing on the \"Twango\" rope. The players need to grab as many tiles as they can, so the fourth player can climb up the ramp and hit the buzzer to win.\n\nAs in \"Summit,\" the fourth player uses the tiles to climb up the ramp and hit the buzzer. When they hit the buzzer, their opponent's tiles are all washed away. Completing all four obstacles first wins the point.\n\nThe show began, ended, and led into every commercial break with either Nick or Lisa yelling, \"Don't get mad...\", and the audience yelling, \"GET EVEN!\" These words are also the chorus lyrics of the show's theme tune, composed by prolific UK TV composer Paul Farrer, whose other game show music compositions include \"The Chase\" and \"Weakest Link\".\n\nTradition, like in the US version, states each match must end with a handshake (or sometimes a hug).\n\n"}

It is the sequel to 2013's \"The Last of Us\" (2013). It was announced at the PlayStation Experience event in December 2016. Set five years after \"The Last of Us\", players control an older Ellie, who comes into conflict with a mysterious cult in a post-apocalyptic United States.\n\nDevelopment of \"The Last of Us Part II\" began in 2014. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson reprise their roles as Joel and Ellie, respectively. The story is written by Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross. Gustavo Santaolalla returns to compose and perform the score. Anthony Newman and Kurt Margenau are game directors; Bruce Straley, game director on \"The Last of Us\", left Naughty Dog in 2017. The game will feature multiplayer.\n\n\"The Last of Us Part II\" was announced at the PlayStation Experience event on December 3, 2016. The first trailer revealed the return of Ellie and Joel, whose story takes place five years after the first game. Players control Ellie. Whereas the first game centers on love, Druckmann stated \"Part II\" centers on hate. Motion capture began in 2017.\n\nThe second trailer was released on October 30, 2017, as part of Paris Games Week. It revealed four new characters: Yara (played by Victoria Grace), Lev (Ian Alexander), Emily (Emily Swallow), and an unnamed character played by Laura Bailey. Druckmann stated that the characters \"are integral to [Ellie and Joel's] next journey\". The game was featured at Sony's E3 event on June 11, 2018.\n\nIn January 2017, PlayStation Blog awarded \"The Last of Us Part II\" Most Anticipated Game of the Year. Later that year, it won Most Wanted Game at the 2017 Golden Joystick Awards, and Most Anticipated Game at The Game Awards. On July 2, 2018 it received Special Commendation for Graphics and Sound at the Game Critics Awards. \n\nWhile the second trailer was mostly well received, it drew some criticism for its violence. Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe president Jim Ryan defended the trailer, saying the game is \"made by adults to be played by adults\". Druckmann explained: \"We’re making a game about the cycle of violence and we’re making a statement about violent actions and the impact they have ... [the idea] was for the player to feel repulsed by some of the violence they are committing themselves.\"\n\nThe cutscene featured in the 2018 E3 presentation in which Ellie kisses another woman, Dina (Shannon Woodward), was praised for making a kiss – which is frequently considered to be difficult to animate – passionate and believable. Critics also praised the improved graphics, enemy AI, and combat. The game was also nominated for \"Most Wanted Game\" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards.\n\n"}

{"id": "922145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=922145", "title": "Zulu Dawn", "text": "Zulu Dawn\n\nZulu Dawn is a 1979 American war film about the historical Battle of Isandlwana between British and Zulu forces in 1879 in South Africa. The screenplay was by Cy Endfield, from his book, and Anthony Storey. The film was directed by Douglas Hickox. The score was composed by Elmer Bernstein.\n\n\"Zulu Dawn\" is a prequel to \"Zulu\", released in 1964, which depicts the historical Battle of Rorke's Drift later the same day, and was co-written and directed by Cy Endfield.\n\nThe film is set in British South Africa, in the province of Natal, in January 1879. The first act of the film revolves around the administrators and officials of Cape Colony, notably the supremely arrogant Lord Chelmsford and the scheming Sir Henry Bartle Frere, who both wish to crush the neighbouring Zulu Empire, which is perceived as a threat to Cape Colony's emerging industrial economy. Bartle Frere issues an impossible ultimatum to the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, demanding that he dissolve the Zulu Empire. Cetshwayo refuses, providing Cape Colony with a pretext to invade Zululand. Despite objections from leading members of Cape Colony's high society and from Great Britain itself, Bartle Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to lead a British invasion force into Zululand.\n\nThe rest of the film focuses on the British invasion of Zululand and the lead-up to the Battle of Isandlwana. The invading British army, laden with an immense network of supply wagons, invades Zululand and marches in the direction of Ulundi, the Zulu capital. British forces, eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge military technology against the vast Zulu army, become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British, and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts. Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large, British troops begin torturing captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi, Chelmsford halts his army at the base of Mount Isandhlwana, ignoring the advice of Boer attendants to entrench the camp and laager the supply wagons, leaving the camp dangerously exposed. During the night, Colonel Durnford and an escort of fifty mounted Basutos approach the camp. Lord Chelmsford then orders Durnford to return to his unit, bringing them to the camp immediately to reinforce Colonel Pulleine. Lt. Vereker should join Durnford as aide-de-camp.\n\nReacting to false intelligence, Chelmsford leads half of the British army, including the best infantry, cavalry and artillery units, on a wild goose chase far from the camp, in pursuit of a phantom Zulu army. On the day of battle, Durnford and his troops arrive at 11:00 a.m. at the camp at Isandlwana. Meanwhile, the Zulu captives escape from their torturers and regroup with the Zulu army, informing them of the British army's direction and strength. After having lunch with Colonel Pulleine and Lt. Vereker, Durnford quickly decides to send Vereker to scout the hills. Durnford then decides to take his own command out from the camp too, and scout the iNyoni heights.\n\nThe entire Zulu army is later discovered by men of Lt. Vereker's troop of scouts. Chasing a number of Zulu herdsmen trying to hurry away their cattle, they discover the main Zulu enemy force of thousands at the bottom of a valley. Lt. Vereker sends Lt. Raw to warn the camp that it is about to be attacked.\n\nAs Zulu impis descend upon the camp, Durnford's cavalry retreat to a donga in an effort to hold back the Zulu advance. Forced back, the British take heavy casualties, including the battery of Hale rockets, which is overrun by the Zulus. Initially, the British infantry succeed in defending the camp, and Zulu forces retreat under a hail of artillery fire. British units defending the camp are now becoming dangerously spread-out, and are oblivious to Zulu forces moving round the sides of the mountain in an encircling move. As British infantrymen begin to run out of ammunition due to the Quartermaster's incompetent distribution and the British cavalry are driven back towards the camp, Zulu warriors charge the British troops \"en masse\", sustaining horrific casualties, but succeed in breaking the British lines.\n\nAs British troops break and flee towards the camp, the battle breaks down into hand-to-hand fighting between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, amongst the débris of tents, fallen soldiers and supply wagons. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of Zulu warriors, British soldiers and their Afrikaner allies are slaughtered in the camp, some being cut down as they attempt to flee towards Natal. During the last minutes of the battle, the camp's commander, Colonel Pulleine, entrusts the Queen's Colours of the 2nd battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot to two junior officers, Lts. Melvill and Coghill, who attempt to carry them to safety in Natal, passing gruesome scenes as Zulu warriors hunt down British and Afrikaner infantrymen attempting to flee across the river.\n\nWhile crossing the Buffalo River, the three lieutenants are cut down by Zulus and the Colours (a Union Flag embroidered with the Regiment's insignia) are captured. Lying wounded, perhaps mortally, Vereker shoots and kills the Zulu wielding the Colours, and the Colours fall gracefully into the river, where they are carried out of reach.\n\nIn the evening, Chelmsford and the rest of the British army return to Isandlwana, to be greeted by the sight of their slaughtered comrades, and the news that a mass Zulu army has invaded Natal and laid siege to Rorke's Drift. The film ends with Zulu warriors in a silhouetted victory procession, dragging captured British artillery back to Ulundi.\n\n\n\nThe script was originally written by Cy Endfield.\n\nThe Lamitas Property Investment Corporation raised money for the film. They financed a series of films, including several in South Africa, such as \"The Wild Geese\" (1978). The company committed about £5 million to \"Zulu Dawn\", most of it raised from a Swiss bank, the Banque de Paris et des Pay Bas. HBO helped guarantee finance.\n\nJohn Hurt was cast in a lead role but was refused entry to South Africa. This confused Hurt who was not particularly political. It was thought South African Intelligence may have confused him with the actor John Hurd, who was a draft dodger.\nFilming was difficult. Black extras received less than £3 a day. Norma Foster was a liaison between the South African government (notably the Minister of Information, Dr Connie Mulder) and the filmmakers; she later claimed the producers owed her £20,000. The co producers, James Faulkner and Barry St Clare, claimed they were owed £100,000 in deferred fees. Over 100 creditors in South Africa claimed they were owed £250,000. The producers sought an injunction to block screening of the film until they were paid. Lamitas denied liability for the money, claiming expenses exceeded the agreed budget. The offered to settle for 25p in the pound.\n\nThere was further controversy when it was discovered the Zulu extras were being paid $2.70 a day but the dog was being paid $4.50 a day.\nDespite having a large budget and being designed to complement the hugely successful film \"Zulu\", the film was not well received and did not fare particularly well at the box office.\n\n"}
