She is helped along the way by an odd group of friends and her ever-cool aunt, Tanner Clark.\n\nThe book has been nominated for 13 Eisner Awards as well as five Harvey Awards. It was also a short list finalist for the Howard E. Day Prize in 2002. In 2007, \"Amelia Rules! Volume 3: Superheroes\" won the Cybil Award for best graphic novel for readers twelve and under.\n\nEight book collections of comic book stories have been published so far: The Whole World's Crazy, What Makes You Happy, Superheroes, When the Past is a Present, The Tweenage Guide to Not Being Unpopular, True Things (Adults Don't Want Kids to Know) The Meaning of Life...and Other Stuff, and \"Her Permanent Record\".\n\nIn 2008, \"Amelia Rules!\" received four Eisner Nominations, tying Gownley for most nominations by an individual that year. Nominations that year were for \"Best Title For A Younger Audience,\" \"Best Single Issue,\" \"Best Coloring,\" and \"Best Lettering. Also in 2008, the Pennsylvania Library Association named \"Amelia Rules! Volume 4\", as one of its \"One Book\" award winners.\n\nIn 2009, \"Amelia Rules!\" was nominated for three Harvey Awards: Best Artist (Jimmy Gownley), Best Letterer (Jimmy Gownley) and Best Graphic Album.\n\nIn 2012, \"Her Permanent Record\" became the first \"Amelia Rules!\" book to make the \"New York Times\" bestseller list.\n\nThe trademark for Amelia Rules! is held by Jimmy Gownley and Karen Applegate-Gownley.\n\n\nAmelia McBride\n\nAmelia Louise McBride is a 5th-grade spitfire, a whip-smart, wisecracking tomboy who can be surprisingly sweet and giving. Forced out of New York City following her parents’ divorce, Amelia takes setbacks in stride—for the most part.\n\nReggie Grabinsky\n\nLeader and founder of G.A.S.P. (Gathering of Awesome Super Pals), Reggie Grabinsky is a fun-loving, silly guy with a loose grasp on reality. However he can be something that might be considered mature when he needs to.\n\nRhonda Bleenie\n\nRhonda Bleenie is a smart, stubborn, and loud girl. She is friends with Amelia because of geography and nothing else. She was well known for her hairstyle until she adapted a more down-to-earth look, as well as her unabashed love for Reggie.\n\nPajamaman\n\nBeing the most popular kid in class, being dirt poor, never speaking, and never changing out of his “footie” pajamas requires the magic of this man...Pajamaman. How does he do it? Pajamaman is a loyal friend, a great listener, and cute as a button.\nThough 'PM' is the shy, silent type, one can always know what he's thinking by checking out the symbol on his jammies.\n\nTanner Clark\n\nAmelia’s Aunt Tanner is a friend, a confidant, and a mentor. She’s Amelia’s Jiminy Cricket. That is, if Jiminy was a Rock ‘N Roll hipster hottie, instead of, y’know, a bug. She always tells the truth, even when it’s difficult. At one time Tanner was a pop rock princess who ruled the charts, but she retired for mysterious reasons and now lives the quiet life in small town PA. But there is always the chance of a big-time comeback tour.\n\nAmelia’s mom and dad\n\nTypical average parents who are going through a divorce. Amelia’s mom is a bit too overwhelmed to completely connect with her daughter at times but her love for Amelia is evident. She uses care and caution when approaching potentially unsettling moments, like telling Amelia that they are moving (again) and breaking the news that she is going out on a date.\n\nAmelia’s dad also loves his daughter unconditionally, but struggles to be an active part of her life, given his infrequent visits and the miles that separate them. A bit depressed from the collapse of his marriage and the dwindling popularity of the company he promotes (he’s marketing director for Softee Chicken, a once-popular kids’ franchise), he still maintains a semi-cordial relationship with his ex (that is when he doesn't think Amelia is around).\n\nNinja Kyle\n\nLeader of G.A.S.P.’s arch-rivals, the Park View Terrace Ninjas, Kyle comes off as an arrogant jerk, taking great delight in embarrassing (even humiliating) other kids. But Kyle’s jerk-like tendencies may be rooted in something deeper - a genuine affection for Amelia, who reluctantly gets past Kyle’s tough exterior, and even agrees to be his “date” to their first school dance. It is difficult to understand how Amelia could ignore Kyle's awful behavior, and it can only be guessed that Kyle's occasional moments of humanity make it difficult for her to remember the worse things he's done. He was injured in a fall at the climax of \"True Things\" and reappears in \"Her Permanent Record\" in which he has not completely recovered from his injuries after he broke his leg. He also started to reconnect with Amelia and become friends again after the accident.\n\nTrishia\n\nA friend of both Amelia and Ninja Kyle, Trishia is the writer for all articles in the \"Tweennie Zeenie\" (a neighborhood magazine). She writes them all under different pen names except for a story called \"The Adventures of Princess Trishara\". She suffers from a severe case of ventricular septal defect which eventually causes her to move to California to see a specialist in \"Superheroes\", but she sends Amelia a letter years later to tell her that she survived the operation.\n\nSunday Jones\n\nAmelia’s best friend from her New York days, Sunday is Amelia’s equal in terms of spunk and wit.\n\nNinja Joan Driscoll\n\nOriginally known to Amelia only as a member of the rival Park View Terrace Ninjas, Joan became closer friends with Amelia and Rhonda after her father, a Captain in the US Army, was deployed overseas for a year. Joan’s tomboy tendencies and a quick wit make her a natural fit in Amelia’s small group of friends.\n\nOwen\n\nA minor friend of Amelia. He is mentioned to always smell like cheese. He is also a member of G.A.S.P., although, he doesn't seem to have an alter ego and simply wears homemade bat wings that he believes enables him to fly, which is proven wrong when he attempted to ambush the Park View Terrace Ninjas and fell.\n\nMary Violet/Ultra Violet\n\nA girl who appears to be Catholic and described as a \"Cabbage Patch Kid that threw up\". In the second volume, she develops a violent personality after a fight with Reggie and joins G.A.S.P. under the alias Ultra Violet.\n\nEarth Dog\n\nReggie's cousin who enjoys writing poems and is a member of G.A.S.P. as Bear Hugger.\n\nBug And Iggy\n\nBullies that torment Reggie. This is temporarily halted after Reggie sneeze-barfed on them. Later, they continue to bully and annoy Reggie by existing.\n\nG.A.S.P.\n\nG.A.S.P. is a superhero group that protects the neighborhood from whatever happens to be bugging leader and founder Reggie Grabinsky, such as Ninjas and the Legion of Evil Steves. Founding members are Reggie (Captain Amazing), Amelia (Princess Powerful), Rhonda (Ms. Miraculous), and Pajama Man (Kid Lightning). New members are Mary Violet (Ultra Violet), Owen (no alter ego), and Earth Dog (Bear Hugger).\n\nBritney, Christina and Jessica\n\nThe so-called popular kids of the school. Every boy's dream and girls nightmare, the mean group is constantly teasing everyone in school. The posse is led by Britney, whose biting wit can put a comedian to shame. As part of the cheerleaders, these evil triplets are someone to look out for.\n\n"}

{"id": "43007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43007", "title": "Blur (band)", "text": "Blur (band)\n\nBlur are an English rock band, formed in London in 1988. The group consists of singer/keyboardist Damon Albarn, guitarist/singer Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Their debut album \"Leisure\" (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles and XTC, Blur released \"Modern Life Is Rubbish\" (1993), \"Parklife\" (1994) and \"The Great Escape\" (1995). In the process, the band became central to the Britpop music and culture movement, and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a chart battle with rivals Oasis in 1995 dubbed the \"Battle of Britpop\".\n\nIn recording their follow-up, \"Blur\" (1997), the band underwent another reinvention, showing influence from the lo-fi style of American indie rock groups. The band's third UK number one album, \"Blur\" included the \"Song 2\" single, which brought them mainstream success in the US. Their next album, \"13\" (1999) saw the band members experimenting with electronic and gospel music, and featured more personal lyrics from Albarn. In May 2002, Coxon left Blur during the recording of their seventh album \"Think Tank\" (2003). Containing electronic sounds and more minimal guitar work, the album was marked by Albarn's growing interest in hip hop and African music. After a 2003 tour without Coxon, Blur did no studio work or touring as a band, as members engaged in other projects.\n\nBlur reunited, with Coxon back in the fold, for a series of concerts in 2009. In the following years they released several singles and retrospective compilations, and toured internationally. In 2012, the group received a Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Their first major release in twelve years, \"The Magic Whip\" (2015), became the sixth consecutive Blur studio album to top the British charts.\n\nChildhood friends Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon from Essex met Alex James when they began studying at London's Goldsmiths College in 1988. Albarn was in a group named Circus, who were joined by drummer Dave Rowntree that October. Circus requested the services of Coxon after the departure of their guitarist. That December, Circus fired two members and James joined as the group's bassist. This new group named themselves Seymour in December 1988, inspired by J. D. Salinger's \"\". The group performed live for the first time in summer 1989. In November, Food Records' A&R representative Andy Ross attended a Seymour performance that convinced him to court the group for his label. The only concern held by Ross and Food was that they disliked the band's name. Food drew up a list of alternatives, from which the group decided on \"Blur\". Food Records finally signed the newly christened band in March 1990.\n\nFrom March to July 1990, Blur toured Britain, opening for the Cramps, and testing out new songs. In October 1990, after their tour was over, Blur released the \"She's So High\" single, which reached number 48 in the UK Singles Chart. The band had trouble creating a follow-up single, but they made progress when paired with producer Stephen Street. The resulting single release, \"There's No Other Way\", became a hit, peaking at number eight. As a result of the single's success, Blur became pop stars and were accepted into a clique of bands who frequented the Syndrome club in London dubbed \"The Scene That Celebrates Itself\". \"NME\" magazine wrote in 1991, \"[Blur] are [the] acceptable pretty face of a whole clump of bands that have emerged since the whole Manchester thing started to run out of steam.\"\n\nThe band's third single, \"Bang\", performed relatively disappointingly, reaching only number 24. Andy Ross and Food owner David Balfe were convinced Blur's best course of action was to continue drawing influence from the Madchester genre. Blur attempted to expand their musical sound, but the recording of the group's debut album was hindered by Albarn having to write his lyrics in the studio. Although the resulting album \"Leisure\" (1991) peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart, it received mixed reviews, and according to journalist John Harris, \"could not shake off the odour of anti-climax\".\n\nAfter discovering they were £60,000 in debt, Blur toured the United States in 1992 in an attempt to recoup their financial losses. The group released the single \"Popscene\" to coincide with the start of the tour. Featuring \"a rush of punk guitars, '60s pop hooks, blaring British horns, controlled fury, and postmodern humor\", \"Popscene\" was a turning point for the band musically. However, upon its release it only charted at number 32. \"We felt 'Popscene' was a big departure; a very, very English record\", Albarn told the \"NME\" in 1993, \"But that annoyed a lot of people ... We put ourselves out on a limb to pursue this English ideal and no-one was interested.\" As a result of the single's lacklustre performance, plans to release a single named \"Never Clever\" were scrapped and work on Blur's second album was pushed back.\n\nDuring the two-month American tour, the band became increasingly unhappy, often venting frustrations on each other, leading to several physical confrontations. The band members were homesick; Albarn said, \"I just started to miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so I started writing songs which created an English atmosphere.\" Upon the group's return to Britain, Blur (Albarn in particular) were upset by the success rival group Suede had achieved while they were gone. After a poor performance at a 1992 gig that featured a well-received set by Suede on the same bill, Blur were in danger of being dropped by Food. By that time, Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American grunge bands like Nirvana. Although sceptical of Albarn's new manifesto for Blur, Balfe gave assent for the band's choice of Andy Partridge (of XTC) to produce their follow-up to \"Leisure\". The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.\n\nBlur completed their second album \"Modern Life Is Rubbish\" in December 1992, but Food Records said the album required more potential hit singles and asked them to return to the studio for a second time. The band complied and Albarn wrote \"For Tomorrow\", which became the album's lead single. \"For Tomorrow\" was a minor success, reaching number 28 on the charts. \"Modern Life Is Rubbish\" was released in May 1993. The announcement of the album's release included a press photo which featured Blur, dressed in a mix of mod and skinhead attire, posing alongside a mastiff with the words \"British Image 1\" spraypainted behind them. At the time, such imagery was viewed as nationalistic and racially insensitive by the British music press; to quieten concerns, Blur released the \"British Image 2\" photo, which was \"a camp restaging of a pre-war aristocratic tea party\". \"Modern Life Is Rubbish\" peaked at number 15 on the British charts, but failed to break into the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling only 19,000 copies there.\n\nThe success of \"Parklife\" (1994) revived Blur's commercial fortunes. The album's first single, the disco-influenced \"Girls & Boys\", found favour on BBC Radio 1 and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 59 in the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 where it remains the band's highest-charting single. \"Parklife\" entered the British charts at number one and stayed on the album charts for 90 weeks. Enthusiastically greeted by the music press—the \"NME\" called it \"a Great Pop Record ... bigger, bolder, narkier and funnier [than \"Modern Life is Rubbish\"]\"—\"Parklife\" is regarded as one of Britpop's defining records. Blur won four awards at the 1995 Brit Awards, including Best Band and Best Album for \"Parklife\". Coxon later pointed to \"Parklife\" as the moment when \"[Blur] went from being regarded as an alternative, left field arty band to this amazing new pop sensation\".\n\nBlur began working on their fourth album \"The Great Escape\" at the start of 1995. Building upon the band's previous two albums, Albarn's lyrics for the album consisted of several third-person narratives. James reflected, \"It was all more elaborate, more orchestral, more theatrical, and the lyrics were even more twisted ... It was all dysfunctional, misfit characters fucking up.\" The release of the album's lead single \"Country House\" played a part in Blur's public rivalry with Manchester band Oasis termed the \"Battle of Britpop\". Partly due to increasing antagonisms between the groups, Blur and Oasis ultimately decided to release their new singles on the same day, an event the \"NME\" called \"The British Heavyweight Championship\". The debate over which band would top the British singles chart became a media phenomenon, and Albarn appeared on the \"News at Ten\". At the end of the week, \"Country House\" ultimately outsold Oasis' \"Roll With It\" by 274,000 copies to 216,000, becoming Blur's first number one single.\n\n\"The Great Escape\", which Albarn told the public was the last instalment in the band's Life Trilogy, was released in September 1995 to ecstatic reviews. The \"NME\" hailed it as \"spectacularly accomplished, sumptuous, heart-stopping and inspirational\", while \"Mojo\" argued \"Blur are the very best that '95 Britpop has to offer and this is a most gong-worthy sound, complete with head-slicing guitars, catchy tunes and very funny words\". Entering the UK charts at number one, the album sold nearly half a million copies in its first month of sale. However, opinion quickly changed and Blur found themselves largely out of favour with the media once again. Following the worldwide success of Oasis' \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" (which went quadruple platinum in America), the media quipped \"[Blur] wound up winning the battle but losing the war.\" Blur became perceived as an \"inauthentic middle class pop band\" in comparison to the \"working class heroes\" Oasis, which Albarn said made him feel \"stupid and confused\". Alex James later summarised, \"After being the People's Hero, Damon was the People's Prick for a short period ... basically, he was a loser – very publicly.\"\n\nAn early 1996 \"Q\" magazine interview revealed that relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy wrote that he found them \"on the verge of a nervous breakup\". Coxon, in particular, began to resent his band mates: James for his playboy lifestyle, and Albarn for his control over Blur's musical direction and public image. The guitarist struggled with drinking problems and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. In February 1996, when Coxon and James were absent for a lip-synced Blur performance broadcast on Italian television, they were replaced by a cardboard cutout and a roadie, respectively. Blur biographer Stuart Maconie later wrote that, at the time, \"Blur were sewn together very awkwardly\".\n\nAlthough he had previously dismissed it, Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. \"I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on\", he said. He subsequently approached Street, and argued for a more stripped-down sound on the band's next record. Coxon, recognising his own personal need to—as Rowntree put it—\"work this band\", wrote a letter to Albarn, describing his desire for their music \"to scare people again\". After initial sessions in London, the band left to record the rest of the album in Iceland, away from the Britpop scene.\n\nThe result was \"Blur\", the band's fifth studio album, released in February 1997. Although the music press predicted that the lo-fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur's teenage girl fan-base, they generally applauded the effort. Pointing out lyrics such as \"Look inside America/She's alright\", and noting Albarn's \"obligatory nod to Beck, [and promotion of] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so\", reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time—an about-face of their attitude during the Britpop years. Despite cries of \"commercial suicide\", the album and its first single, \"Beetlebum\", debuted at number one in the UK. Although the album could not match the sales of its predecessors in Britain, internationally \"Blur\" was more successful. In the US, the album received strong reviews, reached number 61 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was certified gold. The album's \"Song 2\" single was also popular on alternative radio, reaching number six on the Modern Rock chart. After it was licensed for use in various media—such as soundtracks, advertisements and television shows—\"Song 2\" became the most recognisable Blur song in the US. After the success of \"Blur\", the band embarked on a nine-month world tour.\n\nIn February 1998, a few months after completing the tour, Blur released \"Bustin' + Dronin'\" for the Japanese market. The album is a collection of Blur songs remixed by artists such as Thurston Moore, William Orbit and Moby. Among the tracks, the band were most impressed by Orbit's effort and enlisted him to replace Street as producer for their next album, citing a need to approach the recording process from a fresh perspective.\n\nReleased in March 1999, Blur's sixth studio album \"13\" saw them drift still further away from their Britpop-era attitude and sound. Orbit's production style allowed for more jamming, and incorporated a \"variety of emotions, atmospheres, words and sounds\" into the mix. \"13\" was creatively dominated by Coxon, who \"was simply allowed to do whatever he chose, unedited\", by Orbit. Albarn's lyrics—more heart-felt, personal and intimate than on previous occasions—were reflective of his break-up with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann, his partner of eight years. The album received generally favourable reviews from the press. While \"Q\" called it \"a dense, fascinating, idiosyncratic and accomplished art rock album\", the \"NME\" felt it was inconsistent and \"(at least) a quarter-of-an-hour too long\". \"13\" debuted at the top of the UK charts, staying at that position for two weeks. The album's lead single, the gospel-based \"Tender\", opened at the second spot on the charts. After \"Coffee & TV\", the first Blur single to feature Coxon on lead vocals, only reached number 11 in the UK, manager Chris Morrison demanded a chart re-run because of what he deemed was a sales miscalculation.\nIn July 1999, in celebration of their tenth anniversary, Blur released a 22-CD limited edition box-set of their singles. The accompanying tour saw Blur play the A-sides of the 22 singles in their chronological order of release. In October 2000, the group released the compilation \"\", which debuted at number three in the UK and received a Platinum certification for 300,000 copies shipped. Dismissed by the band as \"the first record we have seen as product\", the track listing and release dates of \"Blur: The Best of\" were determined on the basis of market research and focus groups conducted by Blur's record label, EMI. By this time, the group had largely disowned the upbeat pop singles from the Britpop era, and favoured the more arty, experimental work on \"Blur\" and \"13\". In an otherwise highly enthusiastic review of the best-of for the \"NME\", Steve Sutherland criticised the band's \"sheer disregard\" for their earlier work; \"Just because these songs embarrassed them once they started listening to broadsheet critics and retreated wounded from the big-sales battle with Oasis doesn't mean that we're morons to love them.\"\n\nAfter \"13\" and the subsequent tours in 1999–2000, band members pursued other projects. Graham Coxon recorded a string of solo albums, while Damon Albarn dedicated his time to Gorillaz, the animated band he had created with Jamie Hewlett. Alex James worked with Fat Les and co-wrote several songs with Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Marianne Faithfull.\n\nRecording for Blur's next album began in London in November 2001, but concerted work started in June 2002, with the sessions moving to Marrakech, Morocco soon after, and then to Devon back in the UK. Not long after the sessions began, Coxon left the group. Coxon said \"there were no rows\" and \"[the band] just recognised the feeling that we needed some time apart\". Before the album was released, Blur released a new single, \"Don't Bomb When You Are the Bomb\" as a very limited white label release. The song is largely electronic, and was part of the band's protest against war in the Middle East. Albarn, however, attempted to assuage fans' fears that the album would be electronic by providing reassurances that the band's new album would be \"a rockin' record\", and also said that it has \"a lot of finely crafted pop songs\". Early in 2002, Blur recorded a song that would be played by European Space Agency's Beagle 2 lander once it touched down; however, attempts to locate the probe after it landed on Mars were fruitless.\n\n\"Think Tank\", released in May 2003, was filled with atmospheric, brooding electronic sounds, featuring simpler guitar lines played by Albarn, and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon. The guitarist's absence also meant that \"Think Tank\" was almost entirely written by Albarn. Its sound was seen as a testament to Albarn's increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music, and to his complete control over the group's creative direction. \"Think Tank\" was yet another UK number one and managed Blur's highest US position of number 56. It was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards. The band did a successful tour in 2003, with former Verve guitarist Simon Tong filling in for Coxon.\n\nIn 2005, XFM News reported that Blur would record an EP, and denied that they would hire a replacement guitarist for Coxon. There were also some aborted recordings made in 2005. Overall the band kept a low profile and did no studio or touring work as a three-piece. After Coxon significantly thawed on the subject of rejoining Blur, in 2007 band members announced that they would reunite, and that they intended to record together first in August, with the date later being pushed back to September, then October. Though the band members finally met up in October, they posted on their website that they had only \"met up for an enjoyable lunch\" and that there were no \"other music plans for Blur\".\n\nIn December 2008, Blur announced they would reunite for a concert at London's Hyde Park on 3 July 2009. Days later, the band added a second date, for 2 July. A series of June preview shows were also announced, ending at Manchester Evening News arena on the 26th. All the shows were well received; \"The Guardian\"s music critic Alexis Petridis gave their performance at Goldsmiths college a full five stars, and wrote \"Blur's music seems to have potentiated by the passing of years ... they sound both more frenetic and punky and more nuanced and exploratory than they did at the height of their fame\". Blur headlined the Glastonbury Festival on 28 June, where they played for the first time since their headline slot in 1998. Reviews of the Glastonbury performance were enthusiastic; \"The Guardian\" called them \"the best Glastonbury headliners in an age\". The band released their second greatest hits album \"\" in June 2009.\n\nBlur also headlined at other summer festivals, including Oxegen 2009 in Ireland, and the Scottish outdoor show of T in the Park. Their T in the Park headline slot was put in jeopardy after Graham Coxon was admitted to hospital with food poisoning. Ultimately, the band did play, albeit an hour and a half after they were scheduled to appear. After the completion of the reunion dates, James said the group had not discussed further plans, and Albarn told \"Q\" soon after that Blur had no intention of recording or touring again. He said, \"I just can't do it anymore\", and explained that the main motivation for participating in the reunion was to repair his relationship with Coxon, which he succeeded at. Coxon also said that no further Blur activity was planned, telling NME.com in September, \"We're in touch and we say 'Wotcha' and all that but nothing has been mentioned about any more shows or anything else\".\n\nIn January 2010, \"No Distance Left to Run\", a documentary about the band, was released in cinemas and a month later on DVD. In April 2010, Blur released their first new recording since 2003, \"Fool's Day\", for the Record Store Day event, as a vinyl record limited to 1000 copies; it was later made available as a free download on their website. \"No Distance Left to Run\" was nominated as Best Long Form Music Video for the 53rd Grammy Awards, Blur's first-ever Grammy nomination.\nIn February 2012, Blur were awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Music award at the 2012 Brit Awards. Later that month, Albarn and Coxon premiered a new track together live, \"Under the Westway\". In April, the band announced that a box-set entitled \"Blur 21\"—containing all seven Blur studio albums, four discs of unreleased rarities and three DVDs—would be released in July. Blur had also entered the studio early that year to record material for a new album, but in May producer William Orbit told the \"NME\" that Albarn had halted recording. Blur's official Twitter and Facebook pages announced that the band would release two singles \"The Puritan\" and \"Under the Westway\" on 2 July. That August, Blur headlined a show at Hyde Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. In 2013, the band performed at the Rock Werchter in Belgium, the Spanish and Portuguese dates of the Primavera Sound festival, and the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in the United States.\n\nIn April 2015, Blur released their first studio album in twelve years, \"The Magic Whip\". Conceived over five days in Hong Kong after a cancelled Japan tour in 2013, the album was inspired by the city as well. \"There's nothing pastoral about it\", Albarn said, \"it's very urban\". \"The Magic Whip\" also marks the return of Coxon, absent on all but one track on \"Think Tank\", and Stephen Street, Blur's producer during the Britpop era. Upon its release, the record was greeted with applause both by the music press and the mainstream media. Awarding the album a full five stars, \"The Daily Telegraph\" called \"The Magic Whip\" \"a triumphant comeback that retains the band's core identity while allowing ideas they'd fermented separately over the past decade to infuse their sound with mature and peculiar new flavour combinations\". The \"NME\" concurred, saying Blur were \"a reunited band making music to rival their very best\". It was also a commercial success, becoming the sixth consecutive Blur LP since \"Parklife\" (1994) to top the British charts. The \"Guardian\" also noted that at times during its first week of release, \"The Magic Whip\" sold \"more than the rest of the top five combined\". That December \"New World Towers\", a documentary on the recording process of \"The Magic Whip\", was released in select British theatres.\n\nBlur have been on hiatus once again since the 2015 tour promoting \"The Magic Whip\". In 2018, Albarn said that a Blur reunion is \"Never not a possibility\", and confessed \"I’d hate to think I’d never play with those musicians again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company owns and operates twelve amusement parks, two outdoor water parks, one indoor water park, and five hotels in the US and Canada. Cedar Fair also manages Gilroy Gardens under contract with the city of Gilroy, California.\n\nCedar Point opened in 1870 as a recreational area. The park was developed over the years going through only a few managements. The park belonged to the Cedar Point Pleasure Company. In 1974, Cedar Point Pleasure Company proposed building an amusement park in Cambridge Township, Michigan on the former Frontier City amusement park site. Those plans were abandoned in 1975. Three years later, Cedar Point acquired Valleyfair. The name Cedar Fair then was derived from the names of both parks, \"Cedar\" coming from Cedar Point and \"Fair\" coming from Valleyfair. Cedar Fair was founded in 1983 then went public on April 29, 1987.\n\nThe first acquisition of the new Cedar Fair company came in 1992 when Cedar Fair bought Dorney Park from Harris Weinstein. Cedar Fair also bought Worlds of Fun from Hunt-Midwest in 1995. One of the biggest acquisitions came in 1997 when Cedar Fair bought Knott's Berry Farm from the Knott family. This marked the first time Cedar Fair operated a year-round amusement park. The acquisition included operations of the Camp Snoopy indoor park at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. In 2005, Cedar Fair withdrew from the lease arrangement leaving Mall of America to manage the park on its own. Mall of America formed a partnership with the Nickelodeon franchise in 2007, and continues to operate under the name Nickelodeon Universe. Several new water park properties named Knott's Soak City opened around the southern California area since the acquisition which included Buena Park in 1999, Chula Vista in 2000 and Palm Springs in 2001. Michigan's Adventure in Muskegon, Michigan was purchased for $27.6 million in 2001.\n\nCedar Fair opened its first indoor water park in November 2004, Castaway Bay. It was added to the former Radisson Hotel which was then renamed. The indoor waterpark resort is open year-round.\n\nLarger acquisitions followed in 2004 with Six Flags World of Adventure. Cedar Fair bought the park for $145 million from Six Flags Inc. and reverted its name back to Geauga Lake, the name the park used until its Six Flags branding in 2000. However, the park started losing attendance and various rides, leading to rumors of the park closing. On September 21, 2007, it was announced that Geauga Lake would close and only the connected water park would operate as Geauga Lake's Wildwater Kingdom. Most of the rides at Geauga Lake were sent to other Cedar Fair parks to operate. In 2011, the water park's name was shortened to just Wildwater Kingdom, removing the \"Geauga Lake\" prefix. WildWater Kingdom closed in 2016. The last operating day was September 5.\n\nOn May 22, 2006, Cedar Fair announced it had outbid competitors and intended to purchase all five parks in the Paramount Parks chain, including at the Las Vegas Hilton and the management agreement of Bonfante Gardens. On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair announced that it had completed its acquisition of Paramount Parks from CBS Corporation in a cash transaction valued at $1.24 billion USD. Shortly following the transfer of ownership, Cedar Fair began the process of integrating the two companies. With the purchase of the Paramount Parks, Cedar Fair LP announced that it would do business under the name Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Cedar Fair LP remains the legal company name.\nThe individual parks continued to operate under their Paramount names during the 2006 season, however Cedar Fair began removing the Paramount name and logo from the parks in January 2007. The names of the parks were changed back to their original pre-Paramount names (the Paramount's prefix was removed) with the Cedar Fair corporate logo added. Bonfante Gardens was changed to Gilroy Gardens. Cedar Fair began removing references to Paramount Pictures Although the acquisition granted Cedar Fair a ten-year licensing deal for Paramount names and icons, such as Star Trek and Batman, Cedar Fair opted to terminate the agreement and not pay an annual licensing fee. All references to Paramount/CBS-licensed properties were removed before the beginning of the 2007 season.\n\nIn December 2009 it was announced that Apollo Global Management would offer Cedar Fair $11.50 per share, a 28 percent premium over the market price, as part of a takeover plan which would also make Cedar Fair a private company. The deal included a cash payment of $635 million in addition to assuming Cedar Fair's debt of over $1.7 billion USD putting the total value of the transaction close to $2.4 billion USD. Cedar Fair planned to hold a shareholder meeting on March 16, 2010 to vote on the transaction but postponed the meeting to April 8, 2010, implying that two-thirds of the shareholder vote needed for approval wasn't yet secured. On April 6, 2010, the deal was terminated, and Cedar Fair paid $6.5 million to reimburse Apollo for expenses incurred from the proposed transaction. Cedar Fair also adopted a unitholder rights plan as a preventative measure to help protect unitholders in the event of any future hostile takeover.\n\nOn September 16, 2011, JMA Ventures, LLC entered into an agreement to purchase California's Great America from Cedar Fair and take ownership of the Gilroy Gardens management contract. The agreement required approval of Santa Clara's city council which was scheduled to vote on the matter on December 6, 2011. However, JMA cancelled its plans to purchase Great America and bowed out of the agreement.\n\nOn June 20, 2011 Cedar Fair announced that long term CEO Dick Kinzel would retire on January 3, 2012 and that Matt Ouimet would take his spot as the CEO of Cedar Fair. Ouimet had been employed by The Walt Disney Company for 17 years, including serving as president of Disney Cruise Line and president of the Disneyland Resort. He officially became CEO on January 3. Cedar Fair launched new websites for their parks in 2012 as well as a new marketing campaign, \"Thrills Connect\".\n\nOn November 20, 2012, Cedar Fair announced it had sold its \"Knott's Soak City: San Diego\" location to SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment. About nine months later, Cedar Fair announced it had sold its \"Knott's Soak City: Palm Springs\" location to CNL Lifestyle Properties.\n\nOn September 5, 2016, Cedar Fair closed Wildwater Kingdom, the last operating part of the former Geauga Lake & Wildwater Kingdom. All land that once contained both properties is now available for redevelopment.\n\nOn October 4, 2017, Cedar Fair announced that Ouimet would step down as CEO and be succeeded by COO Richard Zimmerman on January 1, 2018. Ouimet will remain with the company, taking the newly created position of executive chairman of the board of directors.\n\n\nFast Lane is Cedar Fair's version of a virtual queue system. It was first announced for Kings Island on July 18, 2011. The park served as the testing park for it. For $50, visitors get a wrist band which gives them the ability to get to the front of the line on the parks most popular attractions. Originally, it could only be used from noon to 7:00 PM, but it was soon expanded to be available all day. On January 19, 2012, it was announced that Fast Lane would be rolled out at all the Cedar Fair parks for the 2012 season. There is also Fright Lane, which is Fast Lane for the haunted attractions during the Halloween events.\n\nCedar Fair has some of the most visited seasonal parks in the North America with a combined 25.1 million people visiting their parks in 2016. Cedar Fair's most visited park is Knott's Berry Farm while the most visited seasonal park is Canada's Wonderland.\n\nParks organized with visitors per year:\n\n"}

Eurhythmics was developed in the early 20th century by Swiss musician and educator Émile Jaques-Dalcroze. Dalcroze eurhythmics teaches concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, and is the concept for which Dalcroze is best known. It focuses on allowing the student to gain physical awareness and experience of music through training that takes place through all of the senses, particularly kinesthetic.\n\nEurhythmics often introduces a musical concept through movement before the students learn about its visual representation. This sequence translates to heightened body awareness and an association of rhythm with a physical experience for the student, reinforcing concepts kinesthetically. Eurhythmics has wide-ranging applications and benefits and can be taught to a variety of age groups. Eurhythmics classes for all ages share a common goal – to provide the music student with a solid rhythmic foundation through movement in order to enhance musical expression and understanding. The origin of the word \"Eurhythmics\" is \"eurythmy\" + \"-ics\".\n\nJaques-Dalcroze was appointed Professor of Harmony at the Conservatoire of Geneva in 1892, early in his career. As he taught his classes, he noticed that his students deeply needed an approach to learning music that included a kinesthetic component. He believed that in order to enhance and maximize musical expression, students needed to be trained early on to listen and appreciate music using both their minds and bodies. This coordination of mind and physical instincts formed the basis of his method.\n\nReady to develop and employ an improved, integrated style of music education at the Conservatoire, Dalcroze discovered some obstacles. He found that students with innate rhythmic abilities were rare, just as those with \"perfect,\" or absolute pitch are. In response to his observations, he asserted that in order to develop rhythmic ability in his students, he must first, and as early as possible in their development, train them in exercises that utilized the entire body. Only when the student's muscles and motor skills were developed could they be properly equipped to interpret and understand musical ideas. As he mentioned in the foreword of his \"Rhythm, Music, and Education,\" he sought the \"connection between instincts for pitch and movement…time and energy, dynamics, and space, music and character, music and temperament, [and] finally the art of music and the art of dancing.”\n\nBecause of the nature of his goals in expanding music education, his ideas are readily applicable to young students. An objective of his was to \"musicalize\" young children in order to prepare them for musical expression in future instrumental studies. He believed exposure to music, an expanded understanding of how to listen, and the training of gross and fine motor skills would yield faster progress later on in students’ musical studies. Related to this was his goal to sow the seeds of musical appreciation for future generations.\n\nAs stated concisely by Claire-Lise Dutoit in her \"Music Movement Therapy,\" successful eurhythmics lessons have the following three attributes in common:\n\n“The vital enjoyment of rhythmic movement and the confidence that it gives; the ability to hear, understand and express music in movement; [and] the call made on the pupil to improvise and develop freely his own ideas.”\n\nBefore taking a post teaching theory, Émile Jaques-Dalcroze spent a year as a conductor in Algiers, where he was exposed to a rhythmic complexity that helped influence him to pay special attention to rhythmic aspects of music.\n\nJaques-Dalcroze also had an important friendship with Édouard Claparède, the renowned psychologist. In particular, their collaboration resulted in eurhythmics often employing games of change and quick reaction in order to focus attention and increase learning.\n\nGeneral Education\n\nEurhythmics classes are often offered as an addition to general education programs, whether in preschools, grade schools, or secondary schools. In this setting, the objectives of eurhythmics classes are to introduce students with a variety of musical backgrounds to musical concepts through movement without a specific performance-related goal.\n\nFor younger students, eurhythmics activities often imitate play. Games include musical storytelling, which associates different types of music with corresponding movements of the characters in a story. The youngest of students, who are typically experiencing their first exposure to musical knowledge in a eurhythmics class, learn to correlate types of notes with familiar movement; for example the quarter note is represented as a \"walking note.\" As they progress, their musical vocabulary is expanded and reinforced through movement.\n\nPerformance-Based Applications\n\nWhile eurhythmics classes can be taught to general populations of students, they are also effective when geared toward music schools, either preparing students to begin instrumental studies or serving as a supplement to students who have already begun musical performance.\n\nVocabulary\n\nEurhythmics classes for students in elementary school through college and beyond can benefit from a rhythmic curriculum that explores rhythmic vocabulary. This vocabulary can be introduced and utilized in a number of different ways, but the primary objective of this component is to familiarize students with rhythmic possibilities and expand their horizons. Activities such as rhythmic dictation, composition, and the performance of rhythmic canons and polyrhythms can accommodate a wide range of meters and vocabulary. In particular, vocabulary can be organized according to number of subdivisions of the pulse.\n\nMovement\n\nA key component of a rhythmic education, movement provides another way of reinforcing rhythmic concepts - kinesthetic learning serves as a supplement to visual and aural learning. While the study of traditional classroom music theory reinforces concepts visually and encourages students to develop aural skills, the study of eurhythmics solidifies these concepts through movement. In younger students, the movement aspect of a rhythmic curriculum also develops musculature and gross motor skills. Ideally, most activities that are explored in eurhythmics classes should include some sort of kinesthetic reinforcement.\n\nMeter and Syncopation\n\nAnother element of a rhythmic curriculum is the exploration of meter and syncopation. In particular, the study of meter should incorporate an organization of pulses and subdivisions. This organization can be expressed in a \"meter chart,\" which can include both equal-beat and unequal-beat meters.\n\nThe study of syncopation, a broad term that can involve a variety of rhythms that fall unexpectedly or somehow displace the pulse, is also essential in a rhythmic education. Eurhythmics classes can incorporate various activities to explore syncopation, including complex rhythmic dictations, the performance of syncopated rhythms, the exploration of syncopated rhythms in canon, and a general discussion of syncopated vocabulary.\n\nAges 3–6:\n\nAges 7+ (activities can be adapted to different age groups) \n\nA group of 72 pre-school children were tested on their rhythmic ability; half of the children had free-play (35–40 min.) twice a week for a 10-week period while the other half had rhythmic movement classes for the same amount of time. The group that had classes (experimental group) did significantly better than the group that just had free-play (control group). The experiment group scored four or more points better in every area tested than the control group in the final test. This shows that eurhythmic classes can benefit a child’s sense of rhythm.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47884159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47884159", "title": "Dialect comedy", "text": "Dialect comedy\n\nThe term \"Dialect comedy\" was coined by David Marc in his essay, \"Origins of the genre\". Dialect comedies are a genre of radio (and later television) sitcoms that were popular between the 1920s and the 1950s. They relied on the exaggerated and highly stylized portrayal of stereotypes, usually based on ethnic humor. The genre has its roots on the vaudeville stage and in the minstrel shows that became popular in the 19th century. The ethnicities of the actual actors portraying the dialects did not have to match the characters; while much Jewish dialect comedy was created and portrayed by actual Jews, other dialect comedies, such as those involving blackface, were often not.\nProbably the most enduring program in this genre, Amos N Andy had two feet planted firmly in the minstrel tradition. In 1928, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, two white performers took their blackface act, Sam N Henry, which they did not have the rights to and changed it to Amos N Andy, which became one of the most popular shows of the time. In 1948 Variety proclaimed the show “a national habit, almost as familiar as radio itself.”\nBy the time of its final broadcast in 1960, the show had been renamed Amos N Andy Music Hall.\n\nMama (alternately “I Remember Mama”) was a series about a Norwegian family living in San Francisco, CA starring Peggy Wood, Judson Laire and Rosemary Rice.\n\n\"Beulah\" was a radio series on CBS from 1945–1954 and a TV show on ABC from 1950-1952. It was the first series to feature an African American woman in the main role. Beulah drew much of the same criticism from the black community as Amos N Andy. The show was criticized for its portrayal of the “Mammy” or the happy go lucky black servant who wanted nothing more from life than to serve white folks. When it first hit the radio waves, the character of Beulah was voiced by her creator, Marlin Hurt, a white male; the character was originally introduced nationwide as a supporting character on \"Fibber McGee and Molly\" before getting her own show. After Hurt's unexpected death in 1946, the character of Beulah was played by Bob Corley, another white man. In 1947, African American actress Hattie McDaniel took over, followed by two beautiful African American sisters Lillian Randolph and later Amanda Randolph. The TV version of Beulah was portrayed by Ethel Waters and Louise Beavers.\n\nOften overlooked in modern times were regional dialects that were not directly based on ethnic humor. Hillbilly humor was a somewhat common form of dialect comedy during the radio era, with shows such as \"Lum and Abner\" using the genre to full effect. Southerners (especially haughty aristocrats from the South and their distinctive accents) were another target of dialect comedy, with one of the most famous examples being fictional U.S. Senator Beauregard Claghorn from \"The Fred Allen Show\".\n\nOccasional use of dialect comedy continued even after political correctness led to the dramatic decline of its usage in the 1950s. José Jiménez, a fictional Bolivian immigrant who was created by non-Hispanic comedian Bill Dana, remained popular as a guest act well into the 1960s; Dana never intended the character to be offensive and killed him off in the late 1970s, complete with a mock funeral. The 1980s sitcom \"The Golden Girls\" included Swedish dialect humor in the form of Betty White's Rose Nylund character, who fit early 20th-century stereotypes of the good-hearted but dense Swede.\n"}
{"id": "29509072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29509072", "title": "Docklands Studios Melbourne", "text": "Docklands Studios Melbourne\n\nDocklands Studios Melbourne is a major film and television production complex located in Melbourne’s redeveloped Docklands precinct. The site is located approximately 2 kilometres from Melbourne’s Central Business District. The complex opened in 2004 and its primary function is to support Victoria's film and television industry and attract international and Australian productions to Melbourne. It is one of three major studios in Australia, the others being Village Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast and Fox Studios Australia in Sydney.\n\nThe studio complex consists of five sound stages with a total area of 6,318 m² (68,000 square feet), various production offices, a workshop divided into bays of different sizes and parking for 800 vehicles. The sound stages vary in size from 2,323 m² (25,000 square feet) to 743 m² (8,000 square feet). They are hired for production of feature films, drama series and audience based television programs as well as television commercials, music videos and corporate events.\n\nThe push for Melbourne to build a major studio complex arose in the late 1990s amid concern that it was \"losing some of its media city position to arch rival Sydney and to the Gold Coast\". The strategic objectives were that construction of a major studio complex would represent Melbourne's maturity and global ambitions, develop production capacity to its next stage, and service the needs of the local film and television industry. At the time, Melbourne had a number of smaller facilities with sound stages, but did not have a large state-of-the-art complex.\n\nConstruction began in 2003 on a parcel of land provided by the Victorian government in the Docklands precinct. The studios were a partnership between the Victorian government and a private consortium, Central City Studio Holdings. The complex opened in April 2004 under the name Melbourne Central City Studios and that year hosted the Australian feature film production, \"Hating Alison Ashley\". In 2005, the American-backed \"Ghost Rider\" became the first international production at the studios and, with a budget of around $120 million, was the biggest feature film ever to be made in Victoria.\nHowever, the number of international productions in the first few years of operation did not live up to expectations, partly because of the fluctuating Australian dollar. \nIn 2008 the private consortium withdrew and the Victorian government took control of the facility. In 2009 the Victorian government and the studios commissioned the 'Future Directions' study, which reaffirmed the government's commitment to retaining ownership of the facility and led to a $10 million infrastructure upgrade. In October 2010 the complex changed its name to Docklands Studios Melbourne, formally adopting the name by which the studios were commonly known. In the same year, the Nine Network announced plans to relocate its television production to Docklands Studios, following the closure of its outmoded facility in Bendigo Street, Richmond.\n\nDocklands Studios Melbourne is widely used by domestic and international productions. In 2015 the Nine Network renewed its five-year agreement to produce programs at the studios, including \"The Footy Show\" and \"Millionaire Hot Seat\". The Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Seven Network also use the sound stages, while many Australian films, including \"The Dressmaker\", \"Oddball\" and \"The Legend of Ben Hall\" have shot scenes at the complex. The lower Australian dollar has helped attract international productions such as HBO's \"The Leftovers.\" The complex continues to build its reputation as a supporter of indie films, housing three small budget productions in 2017 - The Wheel, Choir Girl, and Guilty - alongside two mainstream feature films \"Upgrade\" and \"Winchester\". In 2018 the complex is again housing productions of varying size, such as the Australian-Chinese co-production The Whistleblower which is expected to employ 220 local screen workers and spend $40 million in the state's economy. It has been estimated that since opening in 2004, Docklands Studios Melbourne has brought more than $800 million into the Victorian economy.

{"id": "6612985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6612985", "title": "Drive-In Massacre", "text": "Drive-In Massacre\n\nDrive-In Massacre is a 1976 horror film written and directed by Stu Segall, and co-written by John F. Goff and George Buck Flower.\n\nA couple go to a drive-in theater in a rural California town, and are butchered by an unseen assailant, who uses a sword to decapitate the man, and skewer the woman through the neck. Investigating this dual homicide are police detectives Mike Leary and John Koch, who interview the drive-in's boorish manager, Austin Johnson, and the odd custodian, Germy. Germy mentions that a peeping tom likes to cruise the area to watch couples and lone girls, and he is told to try and write down the voyeur's license plate number the next time he sees him.\n\nThat night, the killer strikes again, impaling two lovers while they are making out in their vehicle, and leaving a sword behind. To see if the sword belongs to the missing drive-in owner, Germy is brought in to the police station identify it. Germy states that the sword is not a part of the owner's private collection, and tells the detectives that the voyeur was at the drive-in around the time of the latest double murder, and that he managed to write down the man's license plate number. The plate number is connected to Orville Ingleson, whose home the detectives visit. Orville denies any connection to the deaths, but when a bloody cloth is found in his car, he panics, and tries to make a run for it. Orville is caught, and claims the blood was just from a dog he accidentally ran over, which is confirmed by further analysis, forcing the police to let him go.\n\nThat evening, the detectives (one of them disguised as a woman) go to a screening at the drive-in, and spot Orville there, even though he had promised to stay away from it. After a customer who had stormed off when his girlfriend refused his advances returns to his car, he discovers that his girlfriend has been beheaded. Leary and Koch rush to Orville's car, and find him dead from a slit throat. Austin and Germy are brought in the station for questioning, and Austin antagonizes the detectives, refusing to close the drive-in without a court order, and firing Germy.\n\nThe following evening, Leary and Koch get a call about a machete-wielding man who has just murdered two people being cornered in a warehouse, with a little girl he has taken hostage. The detectives go to the warehouse, and after a chase and stand off, shoot the man dead, learning afterward that he was a mental patient who had escaped only a few hours ago, and thus he cannot be the serial killer.\n\nAt the drive-in, Germy collects his things, and goes to the projection booth to confront Austin about which one of them gets to keep the owner's sword collection, and about money he is owed. As soon as Germy enters the booth, the silhouette of Austin being killed with a sword is projected onto the drive-in's screen while a Wild West movie is being featured. Leary and Koch (who want to talk to Austin) arrive just in time to see this, and break into the booth, where they find both Austin and Germy hacked to pieces and the killer gone with no trace.\n\nThe film suddenly comes to an abrupt end where an on-screen text states that other drive-ins throughout the country are now being plagued by similar bloodbaths, and that the killer's identity is still unknown. A fake public address then announces that a psychopath is loose in the viewer's own drive-in theater, and urges the audience not to panic, as the police are on their way.\n\n\nA score of two out of four was given by TV Guide, which wrote \"Obviously inspired by Peter Bogdanovich's masterful \"Targets\", \"Drive-In Massacre\" has none of its predecessor's insight, intelligence, or craft. Instead, it's an ultracheap slice-and-dice effort that even boasts the tired 'They're coming to get you!' ending designed to make drive-in audiences uncomfortable. Needless to say, the effect is greatly diminished on home video\". Oh, the Horror! said the film was \"a technical nightmare on all levels\" and concluded \"Aside from a great opening double death sequence, there really isn't enough happening in the film to recommend it. It's an oddity, but one not worth much more than a single curious glance\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2960942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2960942", "title": "Gun barrel sequence", "text": "Gun barrel sequence\n\nThe gun barrel sequence is the signature device featured in nearly every \"James Bond\" film. Shot from the point of view of a presumed assassin, it features James Bond walking, turning, and then shooting directly at camera, causing blood to run down the screen. The visuals are usually accompanied by the \"James Bond Theme\", written by Monty Norman.\n\nOriginally designed by Maurice Binder, the sequence has featured in every \"James Bond\" film produced by Eon Productions and, although retaining the same basic elements, it has evolved noticeably throughout the series. It is one of the most immediately recognisable elements of the franchise and has featured heavily in marketing material for the films and their spin-offs.\n\nThe British media historian James Chapman suggests that the sequence is a significant part of the James Bond mythos because it \"foregrounds the motif of looking, which is central to the spy genre.\"\n\nIn all but a couple of films, the sequence begins with a white dot blinking across the screen, from left to right. Upon reaching the right edge of the frame, the dot opens up to reveal a gun barrel's interior. From the point of view of an off-screen assassin, the camera follows James Bond as he walks from right to left against a white background. Suddenly aware of being observed, he stops at the centre of the screen, quickly turns to the camera and shoots his gun towards it. A blood-red wash, representing the gunman bleeding, runs down the screen. The gun barrel dissolves to a white dot which moves from side-to-side across the screen and settles in the corner. With a few exceptions, the circle then either shrinks and disappears, or fades from white to a circular cutout of the first scene, expanding to reveal the full view of the scene shortly thereafter. However, in recent years, the barrel doesn't dissolve or move. After the blood runs down, everything simply fades out.\n\nThe sequence was created by Maurice Binder for the opening titles of the first Bond film, \"Dr. No\", in 1962. Binder originally planned to employ a camera sighted down the barrel of a .38 calibre gun, but this caused some problems. Unable to stop down the lens of a standard camera enough to bring the entire gun barrel into focus, Binder created a pinhole camera to solve the problem and the barrel became crystal clear.\n\nBinder described the genesis of the gun barrel sequence in the last interview he recorded before his death in 1991:\nThe media historian James Chapman observed that the sequence recalls the gun fired at the audience at the end of \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903).\n\nBecause Binder had designed the gun barrel sequence to feature Bond only in silhouette, with a non-widescreen aspect ratio, he used stunt man Bob Simmons, rather than Sean Connery, to film the scene.\n\nSimmons hops slightly as he pivots to assume the firing position and, following the blood wash, the dot becomes smaller and jumps to the lower right-hand corner of the frame before simply vanishing.\n\nIn \"Dr. No\", the white dot stops mid-screen and the credit line \"Harry Saltzman & Albert R. Broccoli present\" appears across the dot. The text is wiped and the dot continues the sequence. The sequence is accompanied by a soundtrack of electronic noises and then numerous notes that sound like they are being plinked from a wind-up jack in the box; the latter is cut short by the gunshot. The \"James Bond Theme\" then plays very loudly, albeit with the first portion, featuring the theme's plucked electric guitar riff, truncated. The gun barrel sequence in \"Dr. No\" segues directly into the credits, a grid matrix of large-scale, bright and rapidly changing coloured circular dots against a black background. This version, without the electronic noises or the Saltzman-Broccoli credit line, was also used in \"From Russia with Love\" and \"Goldfinger\" which fades into the pre-credit sequence.\n\nFor \"Thunderball\", the aspect ratio of the films was changed to a Panavision anamorphic format and so the gun barrel sequence had to be reshot, this time with Sean Connery in the role. It is also the first gun barrel sequence in which the white dot segues to the film's pre-credit sequence, opening up to reveal the entirety of the scene.\n\nConnery wobbles slightly while firing his gun as he adjusts his balance from an unstable position and he bends over to fire. Although the sequence was shot in colour for \"Thunderball\", it is rendered in black and white for \"You Only Live Twice\".\n\nWith a new actor, George Lazenby, in the role of James Bond for \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" (1969), a third sequence had to be filmed. As with \"Thunderball\", the sequence was once again shot in colour.\n\nIn this rendering, the white dot stops mid-screen and the credit line \"Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli Present\" appears, much as it did in \"Dr. No\". The James Bond theme keeps playing though. As the barrel begins to move and when it stops centre-screen, Bond is walking to position for around a second before turning and shooting as the camera tracks with him, resulting in a \"treadmill\" effect. Lazenby is the only Bond who kneels down to fire; this is also the only version where the descending blood completely erases Bond's image, leaving only the red circle. In this version, the gun barrel is awash with prismatic splashes of light.\n\nWhen Sean Connery returned to the role of Bond for \"Diamonds Are Forever\" (1971), the gun barrel sequence filmed for \"Thunderball\" was used. As with \"You Only Live Twice\", the sequence was rendered in black and white, but was given a bluish tint. As in \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", the barrel is awash with prismatic splashes of light, which this time ripple through it. Unlike \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", the splashes of light are erased by the descending blood. This was the last time the sequence was rendered in black and white until \"Casino Royale\" (2006). It is also the last gun barrel sequence in which Bond wears a hat.\n\nWith the introduction of Roger Moore, and the use of a 1.85:1 matted aspect ratio, a fourth sequence was shot. It was used for just two films: \"Live and Let Die\" and \"The Man with the Golden Gun\". Moore wears a business suit and, unlike Simmons, Connery and Lazenby, uses both hands instead of one hand to fire his gun, his left hand bracing his gun arm.\nThis is the first gun barrel sequence in which Bond is not wearing a hat. Additional footage of this sequence was shot of Bond walking straight towards the camera, putting his face into view, seen in the theatrical trailer.\nThe dots that start the gun barrel in \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" are blue but in subsequent releases the dots are white.\n\nThe anamorphic format was reinstated for \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", necessitating a fifth version of the sequence. Moore's Bond wears a dinner suit (tuxedo) rather than a business suit and again uses both hands to fire his gun. This rendering would feature in all Moore's subsequent films in the series, for a total of five appearances, the most uses of the same footage to date. In this version of the sequence, unlike previous and later incarnations, the prop gun held by the actor is never actually fired until \"Octopussy\", as can be determined by the lack of gunsmoke in the freeze-frame. It is also noticeable that the background of this version of the sequence is tinted, rather than the usual white. The tint changes with every Moore film. \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", for example, features an eggshell tinted background whereas the background in \"Moonraker\" has a strong shade of buff.\n\nA new gun barrel sequence was shot due to the change in actor from Roger Moore to Timothy Dalton and was used for both of Dalton's films. Dalton walks swiftly with a slight bounce before sharply spinning and firing. Dalton crouches down slightly when he fires. Unlike Moore, Dalton shoots one-handed. John Barry orchestrates the music for the gun barrel in \"The Living Daylights\" (1987) but Michael Kamen composes a different orchestration for \"Licence To Kill\" (1989). This was the last gun barrel sequence to be designed by Maurice Binder before his death in 1991.\n\nFollowing Maurice Binder's death in 1991, Daniel Kleinman became the designer of the Bond opening graphics. Beginning with \"GoldenEye\" (1995), the barrel was computer-generated (but still resembles the original images of the barrel itself) emphasising light and shade variations in the rifling spiral as the reflected light shifts with the gun's movement. Like Dalton, Brosnan shoots one-handed. Unlike the previous Bonds, he remains bolt upright as he fires, with his gun arm extended straight at the camera. The blood in this sequence is noticeably darker and falls faster than in previous incarnations; in keeping with this new pace, the main melody line of the James Bond theme is omitted in two of Brosnan's gun barrel sequences, \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" and \"The World Is Not Enough\". In prior versions of the sequence, the white dot would open up to reveal the gun barrel before it reaches the right edge of the screen; in all four of Brosnan's films, however, the dot continues moving right until it disappears off screen. Then the gun barrel scrolls in leftward from off screen.\n\nThe teaser trailer for \"GoldenEye\" featured its own gun barrel sequence in which Bond, appearing in shadow, quickly shoots away the onscreen text to only leave \"007\". Bond walks into the foreground, revealing Brosnan's face and proclaiming \"You were expecting someone else?\", introducing him as the newest actor to play Bond since 1989.\n\nIn \"Die Another Day\" (2002), Lee Tamahori, the film's director requested a CG bullet be added into the sequence, which is seen zooming from Bond's gun at the screen and disappearing, suggesting that Bond has fired straight into his opponent's weapon. This was the last gun barrel sequence where Bond wears a dinner suit and the last one until \"Spectre\" where the sequence is placed at the beginning.\n\nThe gun barrel sequence was revised again for Daniel Craig's first portrayal of Agent 007 in \"Casino Royale\" (2006). Unlike previous installments, the gun barrel sequence does not open the film as a standalone segment; it is part of the plot. Having seemingly committed the first kill on his way to becoming a Double-O agent, Bond stops to pick up his gun from the floor but his victim, Fisher, who is a henchman of rogue MI6 section chief Dryden, recovers and seizes his own weapon. As Fisher brings his pistol up to shoot Bond in the back, the frame shifts instantly to the gun barrel perspective; Bond spins around to outshoot his opponent.\n\nThis sequence differs considerably from previous versions: it is incorporated into the film's narrative; it begins with Bond standing stationary (although he was walking toward the door before stooping and turning); it is not filmed against a blank white void and it includes the person whom Bond shoots. In keeping with the black-and-white theme of the pre-title sequence of the film, it is also the first to be presented in monochrome since \"Diamonds Are Forever\" (1971) and the first in which Bond is wearing neither a business suit nor a dinner suit, but is dressed casually. Like Dalton and Brosnan, Craig shoots one-handed.\n\nFurthermore, the computer-generated rifling is microgroove rather than the traditional eight rifling grooves, and the blood comes down the screen quickly, not in a wave, but in rivulets. This is also the first gun barrel sequence without some variation of the \"James Bond Theme\" as, instead, it is accompanied by the opening bars of the film's theme song, \"You Know My Name\".\n\nThe gun barrel was refilled and edited for 2008's \"Quantum of Solace\". It reverts to a more traditional style, although the sequence was placed at the end of the film to start the closing credits, due to a final cliffhanger scene being cut by Marc Forster. The sequence represents Bond as a blunt and cold-blooded assassin due to the pace of the scene. For example, the white dot travels across the screen much faster than in previous gun barrel sequences, Daniel Craig moves swiftly into position, noticeably faster than its predecessors, and the blood comes down in a large quick wash. Like Dalton and Brosnan, Craig shoots one-handed. The design of the gun barrel is also more simplistic, with a grey colour to it as well as fewer and more widely spaced grooves. The white circle also spins into the centre of the Q in the title graphic for \"Quantum of Solace\", and in the Q, Bond is shown walking away after firing for the first time in the sequence. The closing credits of the film follow.\n\nYet another redesigned gun barrel is used for the film \"Skyfall\" (2012). Although director Sam Mendes had originally intended to place the gun barrel at the start of the film, he felt that it would be better placed at the end, as in \"Quantum of Solace\". The film's opening shot instead harks back to the gun barrel, with Bond emerging into a corridor, pointing his gun directly at the camera, accompanied by the first two notes of the \"James Bond Theme\". Mendes recalled, \"I tried very hard to put the gun barrel at the beginning and my intention was always to do that. If you see the film, the film starts with Bond walking down a corridor towards camera and lifting a gun. And of course the gun barrel is him walking, stopping and lifting a gun. When I put the two together, it looked ridiculous!\" \n\nLike with \"Quantum of Solace\", the blood is dark red and runs down the frame in rivulets. However, Bond moves across the screen substantially slower (at a similar speed to the pre-\"Casino Royale\" sequences). Unlike all previous gun barrel openings, Craig swings both his arms as he walks, resulting in a partial glimpse of his gun before he turns to fire. After the blood runs down the frame, the screen fades to black, before being replaced by a title card with a small gun barrel logo celebrating fifty years of Bond films and the text \"James Bond Will Return\" underneath. This gun barrel sequence is the first time Bond has worn a business suit instead of a tuxedo since Roger Moore's original sequence. Craig shoots one-handed.\n\nThe gun barrel is placed at the immediate opening of \"Spectre\", the first time since \"Die Another Day\" that a Bond film has opened with the gun barrel. The gun barrel design is similar to that of the original Maurice Binder era and the Pierce Brosnan era, only sharper. Daniel Craig moves at an average speed (again swinging both of his arms as he walks, but this time resulting in his gun being made much more prominently visible), before spinning, facing the camera and firing, to which the lighting grows darker: it silhouettes Bond's figure and the blood runs down the screen, looking similar but noticeably slower than in \"Quantum of Solace\" and \"Skyfall\". Craig shoots one-handed.\n\nFrom \"Dr. No\" to \"Diamonds Are Forever\", the gun barrel sequences by Bob Simmons, Sean Connery, and George Lazenby feature James Bond in a business suit and trilby. For his first two films, Roger Moore's Bond continues this tradition but without the hat. The following films, beginning with \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" (1977), feature Bond in black tie, wearing a dinner suit (tuxedo). It also continued from \"Moonraker\" (1979) to \"Die Another Day\" (2002). In \"Casino Royale\", Daniel Craig's James Bond is the first shown wearing a more casual ensemble and an open-necked shirt; his attire reverts to a business suit in \"Quantum of Solace\", which is retained for \"Skyfall\" and \"Spectre\". The \"007 Legends\" video game tie-in reverts to the dinner suit.\n\nThe gun barrel sequence is traditionally accompanied by an arrangement of the \"James Bond Theme\", a trademark established in \"Dr. No\".\n\nA slightly different version of the theme has been used in each film, often reflecting the styles and locations featured. Some composers have not used the familiar opening bars that punctuate the appearance of the white dots. Others, while retaining them, have felt free to noticeably alter the usual rendition, e.g. Michael Kamen and Éric Serra, who scored \"Licence to Kill\" and \"GoldenEye\" respectively. Kamen's orchestration was a symphonic fanfare, while Serra's arrangement is played by synthesiser.\n\n\"Casino Royale\" has the only gun barrel sequence which omits the \"James Bond Theme\" completely, instead featuring the opening bars of \"You Know My Name\" by Chris Cornell. The \"James Bond Theme\" returns to accompany the gun barrel sequence in \"Quantum of Solace\", where it continues into the credits. The same goes with \"Skyfall\"'s gun barrel, though the theme starts before the sequence in the last scene of the film when the new M gives 007 the dossier for his next mission.\n\nThe gun barrel sequence is widely used in advertisements and merchandise. References to its circular motif regularly appear in the films' trailers. A version of the sequence is used at the start of the 2012 documentary \"Everything or Nothing: The Untold Story of 007\" which showed each Bond composited together, turning and shooting.\n\nThe music videos to the James Bond title themes \"A View to a Kill\", \"The Living Daylights\", \"Licence to Kill\", \"GoldenEye\", \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", \"Die Another Day\" and \"Another Way to Die\" each feature their own variation of the gun barrel sequence.\nBecause the gun barrel sequence is copyrighted by Eon, the non-Eon Bond film \"Never Say Never Again\", released by rival Warner Bros., instead employed a frame filled with 007's, with the camera zooming into the one in the middle of the screen.\n\nThe sequence is commonly used in James Bond video games and their marketing. \"GoldenEye 007\" for the Nintendo 64 uses the gun barrel sequence in the opening titles. A commercial for \"\" parodied the gun-barrel by replacing Bond with a man who resembled Valentin Zukovsky; he was shot at with a machine-gun before diving off-screen. It was used in a commercial for the video game \"\" asking, \"Do you have what it takes to be Bond?\", and showing people trying to repeat the shot, but spoiling the try. \"Nightfire\" and \"\" each use a version similar to the Pierce Brosnan films. \"From Russia with Love\" uses the Bob Simmons gun barrel from the film of the same name. In the video game adaptation of \"Quantum of Solace\", the gun barrel resembles the one used for \"Casino Royale\", as the game adapts elements from both films.\n\nAs with any cultural icon, the gun barrel sequence has inspired numerous parodies and takeoffs since its first appearance in 1962. The sequence has been spoofed in films, sitcoms, cartoons and in advertisements, including: \"The Simpsons\", \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", \"Family Guy\", \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", \"Logorama\", and \"Garfield and Friends\". WWE wrestler \"Cesaro\"'s entrance is also similar to that of James Bond gun barrel sequence.\n\nIn the 1986 horror/comedy film \"\", the opening credits show Jason Voorhees, the main antagonist in the series, emulating the gun barrel sequence by walking across the screen in a Bond-like fashion and then turning to face the camera whilst swinging his signature machete, drenching the screen with blood in a similar manner to the original Bond sequences.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2414831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2414831", "title": "Heart (symbol)", "text": "Heart (symbol)\n\nThe heart shape () is an ideograph used to express the idea of the \"heart\" in its metaphorical or symbolic sense as the center of emotion, including affection and love, especially romantic love.\n\nThe \"wounded heart\" indicating lovesickness came to be depicted as a heart symbol pierced with an arrow (Cupid's), or heart symbol \"broken\" in two or more pieces.\n\nGreek. In the 6th-5th century BC, the heart shape was used to represent the heart-shaped fruit of the plant Silphium, a plant possibly used as a contraceptive Many species in the parsley family have estrogenic properties, and some, such as wild carrot, were used to induce abortion. Silver coins from Cyrene of the 6–5th BC bear a similar design, sometimes accompanied by a silphium plant and is understood to represent its seed or fruit.\n\nIt is likely that the heart symbol was found in devotion to God. The symbol appears as one rights themselves up, after having prayed with one's head to the ground. The hands form the symbol as one is in the process of standing up. \n\nThe combination of the heart shape and its use within the heart metaphor developed at the end of the Middle Ages, although the shape has been used in many ancient epigraphy monuments and texts. With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th. Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity fig leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of ivy and of the water-lily. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by Al Hariri of Basra. The manuscript includes an illustration of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.\n\nThe first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French \"Roman de la poire\" (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's \"sweet gaze\" or \"douz regart\") offers his heart to a damsel. The heart here resembles a pine cone (held \"upside down\", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into \"Novel Of The Pear\" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love. Giotto in his 1305 painting in the Scrovegni Chapel (Padua) shows an allegory of charity (caritas) handing her heart to Jesus Christ. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held \"upside down\"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by Taddeo Gaddi in Santa Croce, by Andrea Pisano on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by Ambrogio Lorenzetti in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by Andrea da Firenze in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.\n\nThe \"scalloped\" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's \"Documenti d'amore \"(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the Cistercian monastery in Brussels (MS 4459–70, fol 192v. Royal Library of Belgium). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward. The modern indented red heart has been used on playing cards since the late 15th century.\n\nVarious hypotheses attempted to connect the \"heart shape\" as it evolved in the Late Middle Ages with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity. Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown. Specific suggestions include: the shape of the seed of the silphium plant, used in ancient times as an herbal contraceptive, and stylized depictions of features of the human female body, such as the female's breasts, buttocks, pubic mound, or spread vulva.\n\nHeart shapes can be seen on the Bible Jesus holds in the Empress Zoë mosaic in the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, but a reference to the organ was probably not intended. It probably dates from 1239.\n\nLikewise, heart shapes can be seen on various stucco reliefs and wall panels excavated from the ruins of Ctesiphon, the Persian capital (circa 90 BC – 637 AD).\n\nThe Luther rose was the seal that was designed for Martin Luther at the behest of Prince John Frederick, in 1530, while Luther was staying at the Coburg Fortress during the Diet of Augsburg. Luther wrote an explanation of the symbol to Lazarus Spengler: \"a black cross in a heart, which retains its natural color, so that I myself would be reminded that faith in the Crucified saves us. 'For one who believes from the heart will be justified' (Romans 10:10).\"\n\nThe aorta remains visible, as a protrusion at the top centered between the two \"chambers\" indicated in the symbol, in some depictions of the Sacred Heart well into the 18th century, and is partly still shown today (although mostly obscured by elements such as a crown, flames, rays, or a cross) but the \"hearts\" suit did not have this element since the 15th century.\n\nThe heart symbol reached Japan with the Nanban trade of 1543 to 1614, as evidenced by an Edo period Samurai helmet (dated c. 1630), which includes both the rounded and indented forms of the heart symbol, representing the heart of Marishiten, goddess of archers.\nSince the 19th century, the symbol has often been used on Valentine's Day cards, candy boxes, and similar popular culture artifacts as a symbol of romantic love.\n\nThe use of the heart symbol as a logograph for the English verb \"to love\" derives from the use in \"I ♥ NY,\" introduced in 1977.\n\nHeart symbols were used to symbolize \"health\" or \"lives\" in video games; influentially so in \"The Legend of Zelda\" (1986). \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" (1987, 1988) had a \"life bar\" composed of hexagons, but in 1990s remakes of these games, the hexagons were replaced by heart shapes. Since the 1990s, the heart symbol has also been used as an ideogram indicating health outside of the video gaming context, e.g. its use by restaurants to indicate heart-healthy nutrient content claim (e.g. \"low in cholesterol\"). A copyrighted \"heart-check\" symbol to indicate heart-healthy food was introduced by the American Heart Association in 1995.\n\nThe earliest heart-shaped charges in heraldry appear in the 12th century; the hearts in the coat of arms of Denmark go back to the royal banner of the kings of Denmark, in turn based on a seal used as early as the 1190s. However, while the charges are clearly heart-shaped, they did not in origin depict hearts, or symbolize any idea related to love. Instead they are assumed to have depicted the leaves of the water-lily. Early heraldic heart-shaped charges depicting the leaves of water-lilies are found in various other designs related to territories close to rivers or a coastline (\"e.g.\" Flags of Frisia).\n\nInverted heart symbols have been used in heraldry as stylized testicles (\"coglioni\" in Italian) as in the canting arms of the Colleoni family of Milan.\n\nA seal attributed to William, Lord of Douglas (of 1333) shows a heart shape, identified as the heart of Robert the Bruce. The authenticity of this seal is \"very questionable\", i.e. it could possibly date to the late 14th or even the 15th century.\n\nHeraldic charges actually representing hearts became more common in the early modern period, with the Sacred Heart depicted in ecclesiastical heraldry, and hearts representing love appearing in bourgeois coats of arms. Hearts also later became popular elements in municipal coats of arms.\n\nThere has been some conjecture regarding the link between the traditional heart symbol and images of the fruit of Silphium, a (probably) extinct plant known to classical antiquity and belonging to the genus Ferula, used as a condiment and medicine, (the medicinal properties including contraceptive and abortifacient activity, linking the plant to sexuality and love). Silver coins from the ancient Libya of the 6th - 5th BC bear images strongly reminiscent of the heart symbol, sometimes accompanied by images of the Silphium plant. The related Ferula species Asafoetida - which was actually used as an inferior substitute for Silphium - is regarded as an aphrodisiac in Tibet and India, suggesting yet a third amatory association relating to Silphium.\n\nA common emoticon for the heart is <3. In Unicode several heart symbols are available:\n\nAnd from the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs and Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs ranges associated with emoji:\n\nIn Code page 437, the original character set of the IBM PC, the value of 3 (hexadecimal 03) represents the heart symbol. This value is shared with the non-printing ETX control character, which overrides the glyph in many contexts.\n\nThe Unicode character of the letter \"ghan\" of the Georgian alphabet (ღ) has seen some use as a surrogate heart symbol in online communication.\n\nA number of parametrisations of approximately heart-shaped curves have been described.\nThe best-known of these is the cardioid, which is an epicycloid with one cusp; though as the cardioid lacks the point, it may be seen as a stylized water-lily leaf, a so-called seeblatt, rather than a heart. Other curves, such as the implicit curve (x+y−1)−xy=0, may produce better approximations of the heart shape.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54518920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54518920", "title": "House of Aviance", "text": "House of Aviance\n\nThe House of Aviance (acronym: HOA) is one of the \"legendary\" and major vogue-ball houses in the United States, with its base in New York City. It was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1989 by voguer/dancer, record label owner (CEO/A&R), nightclub host, music artist and secretary Mother Juan Aviance—one of the nightlife personalities of New York City. Since its founding, the House has played an integral part in U.S and world ball culture, especially U.S. nightlife. The House of Aviance is one of the longest continuously active Houses to have emerged from the ball scene and is sometimes referred to as \"a working house\" with membership from all works of life, sexualities and genders. Its membership include dancers, musicians, DJs, drag queens, performing artists, visual artists, singers, songwriters, music producers and engineers. The Legendary House of Aviance is especially known for its voguers, performances, runways, fashion, music, music producers and DJs. Its membership as of 2014 is just over 700 worldwide. Most of its members are or have been part of nightlife in one way or another. The House has for a long time stopped competing (\"walking\") in the ball scene, and as such, \"is not exactly like the voguing houses of Jennie Livingston's film Paris Is Burning, since it does not compete. The House of Aviance is something of a queer kinship network in which members serve as extended, pretended, and—some would argue—improved family that supports and enables its members.\"\n\nThe House of Aviance was founded in August 1989 by Mother Juan Aviance. The House began in Washington, D.C. on 1420 Harvard Street before it was moved in 1993 to New York City by Mother Juan. Since its move, New York has become its base, but it still plays an active role in New York and Washington DC's nightlife as well as other cities in the U.S. Since its inception, it has become one of the major Houses in New York's ballroom and voguing scene having won many trophies and cash prizes for their performances in ball competitions before the House ultimately stopped \"walking balls\" altogether.\n\nPreviously, The House of Aviance was called \"The House of Power\". That remained the name for few weeks during its inception until Mother Juan decided to change it to \"The House of Aviance\". According to Mother Juan, he was glancing at a vendor's cart on the streets of DC. The vendor was selling perfumes. As Mother Juan glanced at the cart, he remembered a commercial from his childhood days by Prince Matchabelli. That commercial contained a tune with the lyrics: \"We're going to have an Aviance Night.\" In an epiphany, Mother Juan decided to rename the House to \"The House of Aviance\". Since then, the name of the House's has remained the same.\n\nTo commemorate their second anniversary, The House of Aviance threw its first ball on Sunday, August 11, 1991 titled \"The Inferno Ball at Tracks DC\". Most of the notable New York and DC houses walked that night, including Aviance members. Some of the judges that night included the \"icons\" Dorian Corey and Pepper LaBeija, both featured in the acclaimed Paris Is Burning film a year earlier.\n\nSince its founding, Mother Juan Aviance has remained the \"House Mother\", and Daddy Tony Aviance the \"House Father\". As of 2017, they are two of the longest serving and continuously active \"house parents\" in ballroom house history. The House of Aviance's first DJ was Jean-Philippe Aviance who went on to produce \"Go Bitch Go! – \"Work This Pussy\"\" (Original Bitch Mix) in 1991, \"Useless, Give Me Luv – Alcatraz\" and several other tracks.\n\nThe Aviance style of voguing is referred to as \"Aviance Storytelling\". It is based on graceful, sharp and elegant lines with great fluidity and a high degree of experimentation and individuality. Fluidity is key in Aviance Storytelling. The style is narrative in structure and form, punctuated by an \"A\" or heart-like motif in certain phrases symbolizing the name of the House or the House's logo (\"The Sacred Heart of Aviance\").\n\nThe House of Aviance through its multi-genre record label (Aviance Records, LLC) has over the years produced house tracks like \"Avi'ously Aviance\" produced by David Ohana Aviance and featuring EJ Aviance, Kevin Aviance, Perry Aviance and Mother Juan Aviance; \"OVAH\" by Erickatoure Aviance; \"I Am Art\" by EJ Aviance; and the soulful track \"They Don't See\" — a collaboration between producer/remixer Call Me Cleve (Cleveland Allen) and vocalist Zhana Roiya. One of the most highly acclaimed musicians to have emerged from The House of Aviance is Kevin Aviance with House anthems like \"Alive\", \"Cunty (The Feeling)\", \"Gimme More (Aviance)\", and \"Din Da Da\".\n\nThe House of Aviance's first DJ Jean-Philippe Aviance's 1991 track \"Go Bitch Go! – \"Work This Pussy\"\" (Original Bitch Mix) has been covered and released numerous times by some highly acclaimed DJs such as Armand Van Helden in his 2014 \"Masterpiece\". Britney Spears' 2013 track \"Work Bitch\" from her \"Britney Jean\" album is reported by critics like Barry Walters as a recreation of \"\"the vogueing vibe of gay/trans bitch tracks like Go Bitch Go's \"(Work This) Pussy\"\" [Go Bitch Go! – \"Work This Pussy\"] originally produced by Jean-Philippe Aviance in 1991. According to critic Christina Lee, Britney's \"Work Bitch\" track sounds more like RuPaul's 1993 track \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\". In 2009, DJs Chris Cox and Yiannis Mistress remixed Jean-Phillippe Aviance's \"Giv Me Luv\" track starring Dihann Moore. DJ/Producer David Ohana is a member of the House as well as business partner in Aviance Records.\n\n\"The Aviance look\" is generally referred to as \"Avi'ously Aviance\". The style is flamboyant, big and glamorous.\n\nThe House of Aviance is also known in the ballroom scene for their coined phrases which in essence describes their \"look\" (the Aviance look) in reference to their sense of fashion, their voguing style and performance. Some of these coined phrases include:\n\n\nDespite winning numerous trophies and cash prizes for their performances in ballroom competitions over the years, the House suddenly stopped walking. According to Mother Juan, he decided to stop his House kids from walking balls because of \"Ballroom politics\", unfair judging and the negative atmosphere of the ballroom, such as verbal abuse, intimidation and humiliation especially where kids \"make one wrong move on the runway.\"\n\nThe House is still an active \"working house\" with over 700 members worldwide and regularly hold events/performances. Members still work or perform in their respective fields with support and guidance from house parents - Mother Juan and Daddy Tony as well as other family members. The House's oldest daughter — Kevin Aviance made special appearances in Wolfgang Busch's 2006 documentary \"How Do I Look\". The documentary was a chronicle of the ball culture in Harlem. With the HIV and AIDS epidemic affecting the ballroom scene for decades, The House of Aviance is no exception, and the House and its membership has for years taken active roles in HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention as well as throwing charity events to support organisations like the GMHC.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "179196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179196", "title": "Icehouse pieces", "text": "Icehouse pieces\n\nIcehouse pieces, or Icehouse Pyramids, Treehouse pieces, Treehouse Pyramids and officially Looney Pyramids, are nestable and stackable pyramid-shaped gaming pieces and a game system. The game system was invented by Andrew Looney and John Cooper in 1987, originally for use in the game of Icehouse.\n\nAndrew Looney in 1987 penned a sci-fi short story, \"The Empty City\", that included a game called Icehouse, an ancient Martian game. Readers of the short story requested to learn how to play the game. Thus actual rules were invented for Icehouse by Andrew Looney, Kristin Wunderlich (then future wife of Looney) and John Cooper, then plastic pyramid pieces were made to play the game. The first commercially available set were solid non-stackable pyramids released in 1989 with only 100 sets made. The pieces were made from resin in his apartment, which upset the landlord. After several years, Looney shut down Icehouse Games, Inc. and soon started another gaming company, Looney Laboratories, in 1996.\n\nAdditional games beyond Icehouse were created including Martian Chess, Zendo, and Homeworlds. Looney then created the IceTowers game which used stacking pyramids leading to a change in the pyramid pieces' specification for stacking. The four games were released as a part of Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set, which was the first Icehouse pyramid system release by Looney Labs. In 2001, Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set won the Origins Award for \"Best Abstract Board Game of 2000\". Icehouse was recognized as a game system in the game design textbook \"Rules of Play\" by Katue Salen and Eric Zimmerman.\n\nBy June 21, 2002, Icehouse pieces were being sold in tubes containing a stash, or 15 pyramids of a single color, with nine colors available. Labs then released the book \"Playing With Pyramids\", which contained a dozen games by the Looneys, Cooper, Kory Heath and Jacob Davenport.\n\nIn 2004, the Zendo boxed set won \"Best Abstract Board Game of 2003\", In 2005 the set won the Mensa Select Game Award. While in 2007, Treehouse won the Origins Award for \"Best Board Game of 2006\".\n\nLooney Labs relaunched the Icehouse pieces as \"Looney Pyramids\" with new packaging with its IceDice set in June 2011 followed by Pink Hijinks in December 2012. By 2013, the IcehouseGames.org website listed 400 games playable with icehouse pyramids.\n\nOriginal prototype under the name of \"Pyramid Throwdown\" in 2015, \"Pyramid Arcade\" was launched as a Kickstarter campaign on April 5, 2016. The new boxed pyramid set was funded in under 12 hours. Racking up $150 thousand total, the set shipped to supporters in fall 2016.\n\nThe pieces are four-sided pyramids that can nest and stack with pipping from 1 to 3 at the base. A group of three pyramids, one of each size, is called a \"trio.\" Each \"stash\" or set of Icehouse pieces consists of five trios, or fifteen pyramids (variously called pieces, pyramids, or minions) of the same color and five of each three sizes: five large 3-point pyramids (called \"queens\" in some games), five medium 2-point pyramids (sometimes called \"drones\"), and five small 1-point pyramids (or \"pawns\"). The stacked and nested feature is not used in the original Icehouse game, but is taken advantage of in some of the other Icehouse-based games listed below.\n\nIcehouse pieces were, for many years, sold as tubes containing one stash of durable crystal-look plastic pieces in one of ten available colors (though cyan was only available through their promotional program or as part of the Ice Towers set). There was also a less expensive starter set called Origami Icehouse (later called Paper Icehouse), made of cardstock in four colors, which one punched out and folded into the pyramid shapes. In 2006, Looney Labs began selling Icehouse pieces as \"Treehouse sets\", which are multicolored sets of 15 pyramids: five colors, each color having one each of the three sizes. Looney Labs has also sold boxed sets for Zendo and IceTowers; the latter contained cyan pieces. The Icehouse website also has instructions for making your own pieces. Looney Labs has licensed Crystal Caste to make regulation-sized Icehouse pieces out of semiprecious stone. Beginning with its Looney Pyramids relaunch set, IceDice, the sets are packaged in pyramid shaped nylon zipper bag.\n\n\nAs a game system, Icehouse pieces can be used to play many different abstract strategy games. Most games need at least two colors, and some require other readily-available equipment such as glass stones or a checkerboard.\n\nIcehouse pieces can also be used as a score-keeping device or counter for non-icehouse games. For example, when scoring a Cosmic Wimpout game, a small pyramid would be worth five points, a medium pyramid worth twenty-five points, and a large pyramid one-hundred; the goal being to collect five of the large pieces (for the 500 point standard game). They could be use instead of poker chips, the denominations would be determined by size rather than color (smalls are worth one, mediums worth five, and larges valued at twenty-five, for example).\n\n\n"}

The 90-minute program aired on ABC on November 28, 2013, with guest stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elton John and RuPaul and an appearance by Kristen Bell. It was the second Gaga Thanksgiving special on ABC, after \"A Very Gaga Thanksgiving\" in 2011. The singer had previously collaborated with the Muppets on media appearances and in her shows.\n\nThe special featured songs from Gaga's third studio album, \"Artpop\", and duets with the guest stars. Critics gave the special mixed reviews, with some praising Gaga for being relatable in the show. Other reviewers were disappointed with its lack of production ideas, other than as a promotion for \"Artpop\". It had lower ratings than other Thanksgiving specials, with a total of 3.62 million viewers and a 0.9 rating in the adult age 18–49 demographic.\n\nAnnouncer Tom Kane explains to Pepe the King Prawn that the special is being filmed for Lady Gaga, the latter then appears and explains why she invited the Muppets and then performs \"Venus\". After Statler and Waldorf's review of the performance, Kristen Bell asks for Gaga's autograph. This annoys Miss Piggy who was planning her own finale and enlists the Muppets to hold auditions. Gaga performs \"Applause\", followed by \"Bennie and the Jets\" and \"Artpop\" with Elton John (with the Muppets joining them for the latter). After discussing ideas for the finale, Gaga performs \"Manicure\" and the Muppets talk about the most inappropriate gifts they ever received. Kermit the Frog joins Gaga in a duet of \"Gypsy\", and Joseph Gordon-Levitt duets on \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\". Kermit's friendship with Gaga angers Miss Piggy; after a performance of \"Fashion!\" by Gaga and RuPaul, Miss Piggy bemoans the attention paid to the singer. Although she dreams of singing \"Santa Baby\", she is upstaged in her dream by Youthful Praise. After a trailer for the upcoming \"Muppets Most Wanted\", Gaga asks Miss Piggy to suggest a finale and reprises \"Applause\" with the Muppets.\n\nIn October 2013, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) announced a 90-minute special entitled \"Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular\". It was the second Thanksgiving television special on ABC by Gaga, after \"A Very Gaga Thanksgiving\" in 2011. The singer collaborated with the Muppets for the special, which aired on November 28, 2013. \"I was so excited when ABC called me about doing a holiday special this year. I knew it just wouldn't be a complete night of laughter and memories without the Muppets! Can't wait to see the gang again, and I hope Miss Piggy's still not mad about Kermit ... We're just friends,\" Gaga said about the special. Guest stars included Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elton John and RuPaul, with an appearance by Kristen Bell. Gaga performed several songs from her third studio album, \"Artpop\". The singer had collaborated twice with the Muppets in the past; in 2009 Kermit the Frog was her date at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and she featured Jim Henson's Creature Shop pieces on the Monster Ball Tour (2009–2011).\n\nThe special was described in press releases as \"an avant-garde twist on the classic holiday variety show as Lady Gaga goes backstage with the Muppets, making a performance dream come true for the multi-platinum singer-songwriter when they combine forces to sing holiday favorites and Lady Gaga hits\". It was confirmed that holiday classics like \"Deck the Halls\" and \"Jingle Bells\" would be performed by the Muppets, as well as songs from \"Artpop\". A promotional tie-in with the special was the trailer for \"Muppets Most Wanted\", in which Gaga made a cameo appearance. Kory Grow of \"Rolling Stone\" called the special a \"fitting move\" for the singer, since she was releasing \"Artpop\" and the Muppets frequently collaborated with celebrities.\n\nThe special was acquired by Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, with Dayna Donaldson of the network describing it as \"a high energy and truly unique musical show full of fun\". After its broadcast, it was obtained by Netflix Canada for 13 months of streaming. Previews of the show, uploaded on Gaga's Instagram account, showed the singer performing \"Applause\" and planning a party for the special's finale.\n\nThe special had 3.62 million viewers and a 0.9 rating in the adult age 18-49 demographic. Its rating was lower than \"A Very Gaga Thanksgiving\", which had a 1.6 rating in the same demographic and 5.4 million viewers. The total rating was the same as \"Glee\", which was concurrently broadcast on Fox. It was down by 25% than the 2012 Thanksgiving special, \"Bad 25\". The rating was adjusted to 1.0 by Nielsen ratings. In comparison, ABC's annual telecast of \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving\" before Gaga's special was watched by 5.4 million viewers and had a 1.6 rating in the 18–49 demographic.\n\nAccording to Marissa G. Muller of \"Rolling Stone\", Gaga \"was at her most accessible during the show, sharing the difficulties of life on the road and her love of the holidays – specifically, how she grew up watching the Muppets and has had a long love for Kermit. The whole affair was relatively conservative for Gaga and weirdly progressive for the Muppets\". Muller wrote that the special was aired at an opportune moment for Gaga, since \"Artpop\" sales had dropped 82 percent in its second week and the show was hoped to woo back her audience. She called the opening performance of \"Venus\" one of its top moments. Mark Graham wrote for VH1 that Gaga had a lack of relatability at that point in her career: \"To her credit, [she] seems to have recognized this flaw in her brand strategy and has been working overtime of late to humanize herself ... [Anyone] who watches the cable premiere of \"Lady Gaga & The Muppets Holiday Spectacular\" ... will definitely gain a new appreciation for [her]\". Maricela Gonzalez of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called \"Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular\" a \"cross-promotional commercial\", enabling Gaga to promote \"Artpop\" and enhancing the Muppets' popularity. Gonzalez described it as \"equal parts warm, fuzzy, cynical, and depressed by consumerism overtaking the so-called 'holiday spirit'. But why fret? It’s Lady Gaga and the Muppets!\"\n\nMyles McNutt of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the special a grade of C, criticizing it as a mere promotional vehicle for Gaga with the Muppets feeling like a last-minute addition. The production was unable to balance Gaga's album promotion with a Muppets holiday special: \"Nothing in \"Lady Gaga & The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular\" destroys the sanctity of the Muppets ... However, the potential for a Muppets holiday special was never given room to materialize amidst a Lady Gaga concert special designed to sell her new album. The choice to combine the two may have reached out to a broader audience, but the incongruence of the special's various parts ... was bound to frustrate a sizable portion of that audience.\" Todd Martens of the \"Los Angeles Times\" agreed, criticizing the special's commercial nature; he also said its songs were \"less fit for a Muppet-like music special, and no one seemed willing to stray too far from the show's message of selling a product. Rather than aim for holiday timelessness, this was self-promotion, with the Muppets often coming to Gaga's world than the other way around.\" \"Billboard\"s Chris Willman also gave it a negative review, citing the show's palpably-low budget and its dialogue, guest appearances, Gaga's lip-syncing and production: \"If the 90 seemingly endless minutes of \"Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular\" had a predecessor, it might be the long-suppressed \"Star Wars Christmas Special\", though nothing here was so outrageously wrong (or right) that people will still be bootlegging this one in 35 years’ time. At least there was a familiar 'why is this happening?' question hovering over the star-crossed proceedings, albeit without the benefit of any guest stars as seriously wacky as that one's to show up and redeem the incongruousness. We knew Bea Arthur - we were friends with Bea Arthur - and RuPaul, you're no Bea Arthur.\"\n\nCredits adapted from the special itself.\n\n\n"}

For films made prior to 2007, the nationalities listed by the sources supplying the data are used where they are given.\n\nThe 2015 \"Star Wars\" film, \"\", is the highest-grossing film in terms of nominal box-office sales. The effects of inflation are a significant contributing factor to recent films surpassing the box-office records of older films, so when considering the number of admissions \"Gone with the Wind\" (1940) is the most successful film, although this was achieved over several release cycles prior to the home video era.\n\nThe highest earners at the box-office are mostly American films and UK-US co-productions. Film series dominate—accounting for twenty-eight of the thirty-three films that have earned in excess of £50 million—including six films in the \"Harry Potter\" franchise, Peter Jackson's first four Tolkien adaptations, the four and four \"Star Wars\" instalments. Twenty entries are British co-productions and a further four are based on stories and characters created by British writers. This table only charts films released since 1989, but due to inflation it is unlikely anything released prior to then will surpass the films on the list in nominal terms.\n\nSince 1975, twelve films may have set the record as the \"highest-grossing\" film. Regular tracking of box-office performance only started in 1975, so it is only possible to chart the transition of the record with any serious degree of accuracy within this period. Prior to then, \"The Sound of Music\" is accepted to be the record-holder, assuming the record from another musical, \"South Pacific\", in 1966 and going on to treble the earnings of that film. It is possible that some of the earlier films in the chart did not surpass the box office of \"The Sound of Music\", and it may have retained the record until the release of \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\".\n\n\"Skyfall\", the twenty-third \"James Bond\" film in the long-running Eon series, became the first film to gross over £100 million in setting a new record at the box-office. All the record-holders since tracking began have been either partially or fully produced by Americans, although \"The Full Monty\", \"Mamma Mia!\", \"Skyfall\" and \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" were UK-US collaborations. Only the grosses that set records are included in the timeline; earnings from subsequent re-releases after the film conceded the record are omitted.\n\nSince 2007, under English law, films can qualify as British via a cultural test, through an official bilateral co-production agreement or under the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production. The cultural test utilises a points based system which takes account of cultural content, creative elements and heritage, the nationality of the cast and crew and where the bulk of the production takes place. The application of this process can draw to counter-intuitive conclusions; films not classified as British under this system may have British elements, such as being based on books by British authors and featuring British actors—as was the case with \"The Hobbit\" trilogy—while films that are regarded as quintessentially American—such as \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" or \"The Dark Knight\"—can result in being classified as British.\n\nThe most successful British productions in the modern marketplace generally have American investment, with \"The King's Speech\" and \"The Inbetweeners Movie\" the only fully British films to have earned in excess of £40 million. Film series still dominate, accounting for twenty-seven of the top thirty-four films. The remaining films mostly are adaptations of popular novels, stage musicals and television series and biographical films based on historical events. \"The King's Speech\" replaces \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" as the most successful British production if the criteria is restricted to solely British-produced films.\n\nChinese and Spanish films have achieved the most success at the box-office in the twenty-first century, with three entries apiece among the top ten non-English language performers. \"The Passion of the Christ\", directed by Mel Gibson, is the top performer and Gibson also has another entry in fourth place with \"Apocalypto\"; both films feature dead languages. Only the top two films were competitive with the top British films.\n\nUp to and including 2003, the British Film Institute (BFI) estimate fifty-two sound films have generated over 10 million admissions. The European Audiovisual Observatory (LUMIERE) have been tracking UK admissions since 1996, and they estimate that twenty-two films have generated over 10 million admissions in that period. Due to conflicting estimates, both sets of figures are presented together here in chronological order. While the two datasets are generally consistent with each other, the estimates from LUMIERE are on average slightly lower than those from the BFI, leading to \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" being included in the BFI dataset but excluded from the LUMIERE one. The largest discrepancy is in the estimates for \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\"; there is a difference of 5 million admissions, but LUMIERE do not include any UK data for 2002 while they do for other countries, which may explain the shortfall.\n\nRe-releases also exacerbate the differences in some cases: both \"Star Wars Episode I\" and \"Titanic\" were successfully re-released in 2012, and while the LUMIERE dataset includes admissions from the reissues the BFI chart does not. While \"The Lion King\" did not generate 10 million admissions during its original release, it may have accumulated 10 million admissions due to a re-release: according to the BFI it had generated over 8 million admissions during its first run in 1994, and LUMIERE estimate it generated another 2 million with its 2011 reissue. If \"Bridget Jones\" and \"The Lion King\" are included, sixty-five sound films in total have generated over 10 million admissions at UK cinemas.\n\nIn 2004, the British Film Institute published a list charting sound films that generated the most admissions at cinemas in the United Kingdom. The list is reproduced here ranking the top fifty films released in the UK throughout the twentieth century, defined as covering the period from 1 January 1901 until 31 December 2000. The later films that appear on the BFI list—2001 onwards—are omitted from this chart for the purpose of providing an overview of the century. The second table ranks British sound productions from the twentieth century, five of which are co-productions with other countries.\n\nMarket conditions, industry practices, demographic and cultural shifts have all impacted on cinema attendance throughout the century. Cinemagoing steadily rose during the 1930s with the arrival of sound and peaked in the 1940s, with 1946 setting a record of over 1,635 million annual admissions; roughly equivalent to thirty visits to the cinema per capita. Attendance dropped off after the Second World War, mainly due to the rising popularity of television. The decline of the cinema was compounded by the rise of home video in the 1980s and reached an all-time low of 54 million admissions in 1984. With declining attendance came the closure of many cinemas; a trend that was not reversed until the birth of the multiplex in the late 1980s, with annual cinema admissions climbing back up to around 176 million in 2002. As expected, the 1940s—when cinema attendance was at an all-time high—is the most represented decade on the chart accounting for nearly a third of all entries, while the 1980s—when attendance was at its lowest—is the least represented post-war decade. However, the disparity between the two extremes is not as great as the overall attendance figures suggest due to the fact that vastly more titles were distributed in the 1940s.\n\nWhen comparing the films in the chart, several trends emerge. British films account for half the entries during the 1940s—as opposed to just one entry in the last twenty years of the century—due in part to the British government imposing quota caps on foreign features, as well as the inherent difficulties in importing films during the Second World War. With so many men away on National service, films that performed well were also heavily skewed toward female audiences, exemplified by no fewer than four films headlined by Anna Neagle during this period. Prior to the 1980s when home video became popular, there was also a lot more repeat viewing, with some films during the 1950s and 60s enjoying extended runs—sometimes lasting up to several years—as roadshows. A film's content can also have a prohibitive effect on its success: most films in the chart are either family or children's films, with only two films (\"The Godfather\" and \"A Clockwork Orange\") carrying an X rating or its replacement, the 18 classification, denying entry to minors.\n\nOverall, \"Gone with the Wind\" has generated the most admissions at the UK box office with 35 million and \"Spring in Park Lane\" is the most successful British sound film with 20 million, while 1938's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is the oldest film in the chart with 28 million admissions. While the chart does not take into account silent films, 1916's \"The Battle of the Somme\" is generally regarded to be the most successful film of the silent era, with over 20 million admissions.\n\nFilm series and adaptations have been the highest earners in the twenty-first century, with only one film—\"Avatar\" in 2009—that is not adapted from a pre-existing property or a sequel emerging as the highest-grossing film of the year. Since the British Film Institute does not regularly track admissions, the only complete metric available for assessing a film's success is the box office revenue, and over a period of time inflation of the currency becomes a key factor when comparing the relative success of films. Ticket prices rose rapidly at the beginning of the twenty-first century, with the average cost increasing by over 50 per cent since 2000. To this end it is useful to adjust the box office gross for inflation, so a chart ranking films by the real value of their earnings is provided alongside a chart of the years' biggest films. After recalculating the grosses using the HM Treasury UK GDP deflator, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" remains the most successful film of the twenty-first century.\n\nThe \"Harry Potter\" series is particularly well represented, topping the year on five occasions with two films in the adjusted top ten. The \"James Bond\" films and \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy also have a strong presence, with two films apiece among the top ten, adjusted for inflation. The top ten British productions adjusted for inflation are all international co-productions, and—with the exception of \"Mamma Mia\"—are all \"Star Wars\", \"James Bond\" and \"Harry Potter\" films. Per the nominal record, \"The King's Speech\" replaces \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" as the most successful British production if the criteria is restricted to solely British-produced films.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48916", "title": "Model (person)", "text": "Model (person)\n\nA model is a person with a role either to promote, display or advertise commercial products (notably fashion clothing in fashion shows), or to serve as a visual aid for people who are creating works of art or to pose for photography.\n\nModelling (\"modeling\" in American English) is considered to be different from other types of public performance, such as acting or dancing. Although the difference between modelling and performing is not always clear, appearing in a film or a play is not generally considered to be \"modelling\".\n\nTypes of modelling include: fashion, glamour, fitness, bikini, fine art, body-part, promotional, and commercial print models. Models are featured in a variety of media formats including: books, magazines, films, newspapers, internet and television. Fashion models are sometimes featured in films (\"Prêt-à-Porter\" and \"Looker\"); reality TV shows (\"America's Next Top Model\" and \"The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency\"); and music videos (\"Freedom! '90\", \"Wicked Game\", \"Daughters\" and \"Blurred Lines\").\n\nCelebrities, including actors, singers, sports personalities and reality TV stars, frequently take modelling contracts in addition to their regular work.\n\nModelling as a profession was first established in 1853 by Charles Frederick Worth, the \"father of haute couture\", when he asked his wife, Marie Vernet Worth, to model the clothes he designed. The term \"house model\" was coined to describe this type of work. Eventually, this became common practice for Parisian fashion houses. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their designs.\n\nWith the development of fashion photography, the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1950s. One of the first well-known models was Lisa Fonssagrives, who was very popular in the 1930s. Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 \"Vogue\" covers, and her name recognition led to the importance of \"Vogue\" in shaping the careers of fashion models. In 1946, Ford Models was established by Eileen and Gerard Ford in New York; it is one of the oldest model agencies in the world. One of the most popular models during the 1940s was Jinx Falkenburg who was paid $25 per hour, a large sum at the time. During the 1940s and 1950s, Wilhelmina Cooper, Jean Patchett, Dovima, Dorian Leigh, Suzy Parker, Evelyn Tripp, Carmen Dell'Orefice, and Lisa Fonssagrives dominated fashion. Dorothea Church was among the first black models in the industry to gain recognition in Paris. However, these models were unknown outside the fashion community. Compared to today's models, the models of the 1950s were more voluptuous. Wilhelmina Cooper's measurements were 38\"-24\"-36\" whereas Chanel Iman's measurements are 32\"-23\"-33\".\n\nIn the 1960s, the modelling world began to establish modelling agencies. Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and fashion magazines but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay. They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from customs agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in Paris or the Arena in Milan to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the Marilyn Agency has branches in Paris and New York.\n\nBy the late 1960s, London was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as Jean Shrimpton, Tania Mallet, Celia Hammond, Twiggy, Penelope Tree, and dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors. Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16. At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models. Twiggy, who stood at with a 32\" bust and had a boy's haircut, is credited with changing model ideals. At that time, she earned £80 an hour, while the average wage was £15 a week.\n\nIn 1967, seven of the top model agents in London formed the Association of London Model Agents. The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model Wilhelmina Cooper opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called Wilhelmina Models. By 1968, FM Agency and Models 1 were established and represented models in a similar way that agencies do today. By the late 1960s, models were treated better and were making better wages. One of the innovators, Ford Models, was the first agency to advance models money they were owed and would often allow teen models, who did not live locally, to reside in their house, a precursor to model housing.\n\nThe innovations of the 1960s flowed into the 1970s fashion scene. As a result of model industry associations and standards, model agencies became more business minded, and more thought went into a model's promotional materials. By this time, agencies were starting to pay for a model's publicity. In the early 1970s, Scandinavia had many tall, leggy, blonde-haired, blue-eyed models and not enough clients. It was during this time that Ford Models pioneered scouting. They would spend time working with agencies holding modelling contests. This was the precursor to the Ford Models Supermodel of the World competition which was established in 1980. Ford also focused their attentions on Brazil which had a wide array of seemingly \"exotic\" models, which eventually led to establishment of Ford Models Brazil. It was also during this time that the \"Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue\" debuted. The magazine set a trend by photographing \"bigger and healthier\" California models, and printing their names by their photos, thus turning many of them into household names and establishing the issue as a hallmark of supermodel status.\nThe 1970s marked numerous milestones in fashion. Beverly Johnson was the first African American to appear on the cover of U.S. \"Vogue\" in 1974. Models, including Iman, Grace Jones, Pat Cleveland, Alva Chinn, Donyale Luna, Minah Bird, Naomi Sims, and Toukie Smith were some of the top black fashion models who paved the way for black women in fashion. In 1975, Margaux Hemingway landed a then-unprecedented million-dollar contract as the face of Fabergé's Babe perfume and the same year appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, labelled one of the \"New Beauties\", giving further name recognition to fashion models.\n\nMany of the world's most prominent modelling agencies were established in the 1970s and early 1980s. These agencies created the standard by which agencies now run. In 1974, Nevs Models was established in London with only a men's board, the first of its kind. Elite Models was founded in Paris in 1975 as well as Friday's Models in Japan. The next year Cal-Carries was established in Singapore, the first of a chain of agencies in Asia. In 1977, Select Model Management opened its doors as well as Why Not Models in Milan. By the 1980s, agencies such as Premier Model Management, Storm Models, Mikas, Marilyn, and Metropolitan Models had been established.\n\nIn October 1981, \"Life\" cited Shelley Hack, Lauren Hutton and Iman for Revlon, Margaux Hemingway for Fabergé, Karen Graham for Estée Lauder, Christina Ferrare for Max Factor, and Cheryl Tiegs for CoverGirl by proclaiming them the \"million dollar faces\" of the beauty industry. These models negotiated previously unheard of lucrative and exclusive deals with giant cosmetics companies, were instantly recognizable, and their names became well known to the public.\n\nBy the 1980s, most models were able to make modelling a full-time career. It was common for models to travel abroad and work throughout Europe. As modelling became global, numerous agencies began to think globally. In 1980, Ford Models, the innovator of scouting, introduced the Ford Models Supermodel of the World contest. That same year, John Casablancas opened Elite Models in New York. In 1981, cosmetics companies began contracting top models to lucrative endorsement deals. By 1983, Elite developed its own contest titled the Elite Model Look competition. In New York during the 1980s there were so-called \"model wars\" in which the Ford and Elite agencies fought over models and campaigns. Models were jumping back and forth between agencies such Elite, Wilhelmina, and Ford. In New York, the late 1980s trend was the boyish look in which models had short cropped hair and looked androgynous. In Europe, the trend was the exact opposite. During this time, a lot of American models who were considered more feminine looking moved abroad. By the mid-1980s, big hair was made popular by some musical groups, and the boyish look was out. The curvaceous models who had been popular in the 1950s and early 1970s were in style again. Models like Patti Hansen earned $200 an hour for print and $2,000 for television plus residuals. It was estimated that Hansen earned about $300,000 a year during the 1980s.\n\nThe early 1990s were dominated by the high fashion models of the late 1980s. In 1990, Linda Evangelista famously said to \"Vogue\", \"we don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day\". Evangelista and her contemporaries, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz and Stephanie Seymour, became arguably the most recognizable models in the world, earning the moniker of \"supermodel\", and were boosted to global recognition and new heights of wealth for the industry. In 1991, Turlington signed a contract with Maybelline that paid her $800,000 for twelve days' work each year.\nBy the mid‑1990s, the new \"heroin chic\" movement became popular amongst New York and London editorial clients. Kate Moss became its poster child through her ads for Calvin Klein. In spite of the heroin chic movement, model Claudia Schiffer earned $12 million. With the popularity of lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret, and the \"Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue\", there was a need for healthier-looking supermodels such as Tyra Banks and Heidi Klum to meet commercial modelling demand. The mid‑1990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen pop music was on the rise, and artists such as Britney Spears, Aaliyah and Christina Aguilera popularized pleather and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful demographic, the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following Gisele Bundchen's breakthrough, a wave of Brazilian models including Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s. Some have tied this increase in Brazilian models to the trend of magazines featuring celebrities instead of models on their covers.\nIn the late 2000s, the Brazilians fell out of favour on the runways. Editorial clients were favouring models with a china-doll or alien look to them, such as Gemma Ward and Lily Cole. During the 2000s, Ford Models and NEXT Model Management were engaged in a legal battle, with each agency alleging that the other was stealing its models.\n\nHowever, the biggest controversy of the 2000s was the health of high-fashion models participating in fashion week. While the health of models had been a concern since the 1970s, there were several high-profile news stories surrounding the deaths of young fashion models due to eating disorders and drug abuse. The British Fashion Council subsequently asked designers to sign a contract stating they would not use models under the age of sixteen. On March 3, 2012, \"Vogue\" banned models under the age of sixteen as well as models who appeared to have an eating disorder. Similarly, other countries placed bans on unhealthy, and underage models, including Spain, Italy, and Israel, which all enacted a minimum body mass index (BMI) requirement.\n\nIn 2013, New York toughened its child labor law protections for models under the age of eighteen by passing New York Senate Bill No. 5486, which gives underage models the same labor protections afforded to child actors. Key new protections included the following: underage models are not to work before 5:00 pm or after 10:00 pm on school nights, nor were they to work later than 12:30 am on non-school nights; the models may not return to work less than twelve hours after they leave; a pediatric nurse must be on site; models under sixteen must be accompanied by an adult chaperone; parents or guardians of underage models must create a trust fund account into which employers will transfer a minimum of 15% of the child model's gross earnings; and employers must set aside time and a dedicated space for educational instruction.\n\nRunway models showcase clothes from fashion designers, fashion media, and consumers. They are also called \"live models\" and are self-employed. They are wanted to be over the height of 5'8\" for men and 5'6\" for women. Runway models work in different locations, constantly travelling between those cities where fashion is well known—London, Milan, New York City, and Paris. Second-tier international fashion center cities include: Rome, Florence, Venice, Brescia, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Moscow. Cities where catalog work comprises the bulk of fashion packaging, merchandising and marketing work are: Miami, San Francisco, Sydney, Chicago, Toronto, Mexico City, Tokyo, Hamburg, London, and .\n\nThe criteria for runway models include certain height and weight requirements. During runway shows, models have to constantly change clothes and makeup. Models walk, turn, and stand in order to demonstrate a garment's key features. Models also go to interviews (called \"go and sees\") to present their portfolios. The more experience a model has, the more likely she/he is to be hired for a fashion show. A runway model can also work in other areas, such as department store fashion shows, and the most successful models sometimes create their own product lines or go into acting.\n\nThe British Association of Model Agents (AMA) says that female models should be around 34\"-24\"-34\" and between and tall. The average model is very slender. Those who do not meet the size requirement may try to become a plus-size model. According to the New York Better Business Career Services website, the preferred dimensions for a male model are a height of 5 ft 11 in (180 cm) to 6 ft 2 in (189 cm), a waist of and a chest measurement of . Male runway models are notably skinny and well toned.\nMale and female models must also possess clear skin, healthy hair, and attractive facial features. Stringent weight and body proportion guidelines form the selection criteria by which established, and would‑be, models are judged for their placement suitability, on an ongoing basis. There can be some variation regionally, and by market tier, subject to current prevailing trends at any point, in any era, by agents, agencies and end-clients.\n\nFormerly, the required measurements for models were 35\"-23.5\"-35\" in (90-60-90 cm), the alleged measurements of Marilyn Monroe. Today's fashion models tend to have measurements closer to the AMA-recommended shape, but some - such as Afghan model Zohre Esmaeli - still have 35\"-23.5\"-35\" measurements. Although in some fashion centres, a size 00 is more desirable than a size 0.\n\nThe often thin shape of many fashion models has been criticized for warping girls' body image and encouraging eating disorders. Organisers of a fashion show in Madrid in September 2006 turned away models who were judged to be underweight by medical personnel who were on hand. In February 2007, following the death of her sister, Luisel Ramos, also a model, Uruguayan model Eliana Ramos became the third fashion model to die of malnutrition in six months. The second victim was Ana Carolina Reston. Luisel Ramos died of heart failure caused by anorexia nervosa just after stepping off the catwalk. In 2015, France passed a law requiring models to be declared healthy by a doctor in order to participate in fashion shows. The law also requires re-touched images to be marked as such in magazines.\n\nPlus-size models are models who generally have larger measurements than editorial fashion models. The primary use of plus-size models is to appear in advertising and runway shows for plus-size labels. Plus-size models are also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., stock photography and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines. Some plus-size models have appeared in runway shows and campaigns for mainstream retailers and designers such as Gucci, Guess, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Levi's and Versace Jeans.\n\nA fit model works as a sort of live mannequin to give designers and pattern makers feedback on the fit, feel, movement, and drape of a garment to be produced in a given size.\n\nGlamour modelling focuses on sexuality and thus general requirements are often unclear, being dependent more on each individual case. Glamour models can be any size or shape. There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in calendars, men's magazines, such as \"Playboy\", bikini modelling, lingerie modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in swimwear, bikini and lingerie campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered that England created the market for glamour modelling when \"The Sun\" established Page 3 in 1969, a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of \"Penthouse\" and \"Playboy\" models. From 1970 models appeared topless. In the 1980s, \"The Sun\" competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections. It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of Samantha Fox. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as Victoria Silvstedt left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines. In the previous decades, posing nude for \"Playboy\" resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements. \"Playboy\" was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, Pamela Anderson, and Anna Nicole Smith. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her \"Playboy\" spreads that she was able to land roles on \"Home Improvement\" and \"Baywatch\".\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as \"Maxim\", \"FHM\", and \"Stuff\". At the same time, magazines including Sweden's \"Slitz\" re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men. The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling. With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as Katie Price, became household names. By 2004, Page 3 regulars earned anywhere from £30,000 to 40,000, where the average salary of a non-Page 3 model, as of 2011, was between £10,000 and 20,000. In the early 2000s, glamour models, and aspiring glamour models, appeared on reality television shows such as \"Big Brother\" to gain fame. Several \"Big Brother\" alumni parlayed their fifteen minutes of fame into successful glamour modelling careers. However, the glamour market became saturated by the mid-2000s, and numerous men's magazines including \"Arena\", \"Stuff\" and \"FHM\" in the United States went under. During this time, there was a growing trend of glamour models, including Kellie Acreman and Lauren Pope, becoming DJs to supplement their income. In a 2012 interview, Keeley Hazell said that going topless is not the best way to achieve success and that \"[she] was lucky to be in that 1% of people that get that, and become really successful.\"\n\nAn alternative model is any model who does not fit into the conventional model types and may include punk, goth, fetish, and tattooed models or models with distinctive attributes. This type of modeling is usually a cross between glamour modeling and art modeling. Publishers such as Goliath Books in Germany introduced alternative models and punk photography to larger audiences. Billi Gordon, then known as Wilbert Anthony Gordon, was the top greeting card model in the world and inspired a cottage industry, including greeting cards, T-shirts, fans, stationery, gift bags, etc.\n\nSome models are employed for their body parts. For example, hand models may be used to promote products held in the hand and nail-related products. (e.g. rings, other jewelry or nail polish). They are frequently part of television commercials. Many parts models have exceptionally attractive body parts, but there is also demand for unattractive or unusual looking body parts for particular campaigns.\n\nHands are the most in-demand body parts. Feet models are also in high demand, particularly those who fit sample size shoes. Models are also successful modelling other specific parts including abs, arms, back, bust or chest, legs, and lips. Some petite models (females who are under and do not qualify as fashion models) have found success in women's body part modelling.\n\nParts model divisions can be found at agencies worldwide. Several agencies solely represent parts models, including Hired Hands in London, Body Parts Models in Los Angeles, Carmen Hand Model Management in New York and Parts Models in New York. Parts Models is the largest parts agency, representing over 300 parts models.\n\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in fitness and figure competitions. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\nA , often abbreviated to , is a Japanese female model who primarily models on magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs.\n\nGravure idols appear in a wide range of photography styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular female idols in Japan launched their careers by starting out as gravure idols.\n\nCommercial print models generally appear in print ads for non-fashion products, and in television commercials. Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.\n\nThere are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.\n\nA promotional model is a model hired to drive consumer demand for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing. This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional advertising media (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\nMarketing campaigns that make use of promotional models may take place in stores or shopping malls, at tradeshows, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific brand in advertisements. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the Marlboro Man between 1954 and 1999.\n\nTrade show models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are freelancers hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\nAtmosphere models are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party.\n\nPodium models differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing. Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\nArt models pose for any visual artist as part of the creative process. Art models are often paid professionals who provide a reference or inspiration for a work of art that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are figure drawing, figure painting, sculpture and photography, but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in illustration, its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for art classes or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\nInstagram models have become popular due to the widespread use of social media. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on Instagram and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as Cara Delevingne and Gigi Hadid, who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers, although some models, such as Playboy model Lindsey Pelas, begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as Rosie Roff who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a ring girl in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts. American male model Matthew Noszka entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by Wilhelmina Models.\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as Rumi Neely and Chiara Ferragni began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits. Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in influencer marketing, promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas. High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands. When choosing whom to employ, brands have become less concerned with the number of followers an influencer has and more focussed on their engagement marketing strategy. Research indicates that 89 per cent of influencers use Instagram to promote themselves compared to 20 per cent using Twitter and 16 per cent using Facebook.\n\nSome Instagram models have gained high-profile modelling jobs and become celebrities. Fitness model Jen Selter had become an Internet celebrity by 2014 with nearly 2 million Instagram followers, gaining professional sports management work and modelling for \"Vanity Fair\" magazine. Cosplayer and model Anna Faith had acquired over 250,000 Instagram followers by 2014, gaining success from her ability to impersonate the Disney character Elsa. With Facebook's continuing decrease in post reach, Instagram has increasingly become the favorite platform for cosplayers. American actress Caitlin O'Connor had almost 300,000 Instagram followers in 2016, earning most of her social media income from endorsing products on Instagram. Australian personal trainer Kayla Itsines acquired five-and-a-half million Instagram followers allowing her to build a business in the fitness industry. Brazilian model Claudia Alende had gained a following of 2.8 million people on Instagram by 2015 and developed a career as a lingerie model. Plus-size models Iskra Lawrence and Tess Holliday have used Instagram to demonstrate their potential as models. Yashika Aannand, an Indian teenage actress rose to prominence in the Tamil film industry after gaining popularity among the public as an Instagram model with over 145,000 followers on her account by 2017. \n\nInstagram model techniques and aesthetics have also been used in unconventional or parody profiles. Instagram model Lil Miquela has blurred the line between reality and social media, amassing more than 200,000 followers without it being revealed whether she is real or computer-generated. Australian comedian Celeste Barber had acquired 1.8 million Instagram followers by 2017, parodying celebrity fashion photographs with real-life reenactments. In 2016, French organization Addict Aide ran a campaign to raise awareness for alcohol abuse among young people in which a model posed as Louise Delage, a fictitious 25-year-old Parisian whose Instagram photos nearly always featured alcohol. The account amassed 65,000 followers in a month, after which a reveal video posted to it had over 160,000 views.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5739600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5739600", "title": "Music supervisor", "text": "Music supervisor\n\nA music supervisor is a person who combines music and visual media. According to The Guild of Music Supervisors, a music supervisor is “a qualified professional who oversees all music related aspects of film, television, advertising, video games and other existing or emerging visual media platforms as required.” In the musical theatre industry, a music supervisor is often responsible for managing a team of music directors working on any number of musical productions.\n\nA music supervisor is somebody with a broad and encyclopedic music expertise and a sophisticated knowledge of music licensing and negotiation. Typically, a music supervisor proposes previously recorded songs to the director or producer of a film, advertisement, television show, trailer, promo, video game, or any other form of visual media. A music supervisor will usually act as a liaison between the creative and business ends of the process. Once a song is approved, they approach the rights holders of that song to seek permission to license (usually creating master recording licenses and synchronization licenses) and to work out the financial details of the song’s use. In many instances, the artist or songwriter of the recorded song is given the opportunity to accept or decline the synchronization of their song. This position is most active within media-based industries, including live events, television, film, advertising, theatre, and video gaming. Music supervisors may work within production companies, film studios, networks, music supervision companies, or do freelance work.\n\nA supervisor’s responsibilities are to locate, secure and oversee music related talent. They liaise between the rights holders of the recorded music involved and the director of the project they have been hired to work on. In addition, they advise, generate and work within financial parameters of the project they are hired to work on. They must deliver musical elements within a timely manner and secure legal rights of the song before it is used. The music supervisor will gather the appropriate information to list credits and, in certain cases, will manage royalty collection.\n\nThe overarching responsibility of a music supervisor is to meet the needs of a project’s director and producer. This means catering to the creative goals of a project under a strict budget: often less than 5% of a project’s total budget.\n\nThe director/producer will discuss their vision for the project with the music supervisor, and how they expect the music to enhance this vision. The visual media will then be spotted by the supervisor – a process of choosing where selected music will be inserted. Traditional spots include the main title, opening credits, and closing credits, while additional spots are incorporated to trigger emotional responses from viewers. Scores, or background music, are also an important consideration for enhancing visual media. Scores can range from the background to a dramatic scene to television bumpers – the music signifying leading into or coming back from a commercial break.\n\nAfter being given or creating a budget, the supervisor must select appropriate music for the project – either by licensing existing songs/scores, or creating new songs/scores. In the selection process, a music supervisor may choose to seek the help of a third party licensing company or a music publisher, which will pitch songs to the supervisor from within their library of music. If creating new music, the supervisor may become responsible for additional roles, including securing artists or composers, facilitating the production and recording process, overseeing finances, and finalizing post-theatrical uses of the soundtrack.When using pre-existing music, the supervisor’s duties focus on the legal and financial aspects of licensing and negotiating. A large percentage of a music supervisor’s job revolves around music clearance alone.\n\nWhen it comes to royalty collections, a music supervisor will sometimes be in charge of arranging this source of the selected artist's revenue. Royalties for music placements are paid out by Performance Rights Organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC in the United States). In order to detect the placements an artist has made with visual media, these companies need to be aware of their placement. Depending on the type of project (ad placement, television show, etc.). the music supervisor will have to either make sure the artist is credited properly, send video clips of the placement to the publisher (which will then be sent to the proper Performance Rights Organization),or create a cue sheet of all of the songs used in the project\n\nMany directors and producers will choose to work with a single supervisor for a project, however it varies from project to project. For example, music supervisors can be hired at an entertainment company as an “in house” staff member to manage the supervision for several projects (such as at an advertising agency). A production company may also hire a supervisor on a project-by-project basis (such as hiring one supervisor for an entire television series as seen with Gossip Girl or The O.C.). Music supervisors may also be hired on a show-by-show basis (ex. AMC’s Mad Men, which has used multiple music supervisors).\n\nA music supervisor must have a wide knowledge of music and a passion for musical research. There is no set educational or career path to become a music supervisor. Educational backgrounds range from Bachelor of Fine Arts in music to business degrees to no higher education at all (Baskerville). Because the majority of the position involves music negotiations, clearances, publishing/performing deals, etc., a legal background is an excellent qualification. Some supervisors are musicians, producers, agents, or managers – experience with the music or film/television industries is a strong background upon which to build. Despite common misconceptions, musical knowledge (writing, reading, performing, composing) is not nearly as important as a familiarity with a broad range of music, including popular styles and artists, as well as the production/negotiating process itself (Baskerville). Author of \"Music Business Handbook and Career Guide\" David Baskerville notes \"This is one of the few production specialties that has almost unlimited growth potential, because there [is] no universally accepted job description. The field remains wide open to people with connections and the ability to get the job done.\"\n\nThe proliferation of video technology has resulted in an increased demand for production companies needing to license music, and the field now accommodates many career professionals. Because of the massive expansion in the field, many colleges and universities offer courses in music supervision. For example, NYU Steinhardt’s Music Business program offers a course titled “Strategic Music and Branding”.\n\nMusic supervisor salaries vary depending upon the project and the hiring process. Salaries can range from $35,000 annually at a music supervision firm, to upwards of $250,000 for a freelance supervisor per feature film (Austin). Music supervisors also have the opportunity to continue receiving funds through soundtrack royalties. It is generally more profitable (assuming one will be regularly hired) to work freelance jobs than to work for a larger corporation. However some supervisors may choose to work within a music supervision company (such as Chop Shop Music Supervision). In addition, music supervisors who work \"in house\" within an entertainment, such as an advertising agency or within the music department of a production company, will earn a salary based upon their ranking and company earnings. While staff jobs with a network, studio, or production company offer more security, the recognition and pay are significantly lower. Despite the environment, a music supervisor should always work out a contract including expectations, responsibilities, and payment before beginning a project.\n\nOriginally, music was used in silent films to hide mechanical noises within a theatre, like the projector. Often a musician would be present to play improvised or pre-selected pieces along with the visual images on screen. This led to the establishment of the soundtrack, and an emphasis on accompanying silent visual media with music. Over time, films began hiring composers to create instrumental soundtracks to accompany films. It became apparent to studios that when a movie included a hit song, more people were likely to see it, and as a result of that, more people were likely to purchase the song recording. The demand for music supervisors in the production process solidified in the 1980s, and has continued to grow with the popularity of media soundtracks. While the use of songs not originally composed for the film did not save money, licensing a song made for a more stable understanding for the director and producer of the film what music was going to be used in the scene. Instead of having to wait for new instrumental music to be commissioned, they could have an understanding of what recording would be used before the film was finalized. This led to an emerging need for selecting and licensing songs, which is how the position of music supervisor developed. Taking advantage of this musical component has become an increasingly feasible marketing strategy for these media outlets, placing a growing responsibility on the music supervisor.\n\nOver the past decade, synchronization licensing has become one of the most significant ways for an artist to gain exposure and to earn money. Finding a way to a music supervisor can give an artist the opportunity to spread their music on a platform that would expose them to a much larger audience than they may have been able to find on their own. One of the most notable synchronization collaborations was with Moby’s 1999 album Play, which was the first ever to have all of its tracks linked to a synchronization license.\n\nThe job of a music supervisor has only recently become increasingly significant and the importance of this position continues to grow. Institutions such as the Guild of Music Supervisors are promoting the understanding of music supervision. In 2007 several supervisors, in order to promote, pursue and recognize the craft of music supervision. Since 2011 guild has granted awards for excellence in the position. They encourage other institutions, such as the Hollywood Music and Media Awards, to acknowledge accomplishments in the field.\n\nIn 2009, French singer, actor and producer Benjamin Biolay wrote and released a song featuring vocals by music supervisor Frederic Schindler called \"Buenos Aires\" that was included in his double album La Superbe, certified Platinum.\n\nIn 2013, Los Angeles musician Joe Treewater wrote and released a song about music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas called \"Alexandra Rhapsody.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "47634482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47634482", "title": "Okhlos", "text": "Okhlos\n\nOkhlos (stylized as OKHLOS) is an action roguelike video game developed by Argentina-based independent video game developer Coffee Powered Machine and published by Devolver Digital. It was released on 18 August 2016.\n\n\"Okhlos\" is set in ancient Greece, where the land is ruled by the Olympian gods, who are highly praised by the people. However, the game's protagonist, an unnamed philosopher, is critical about their behaviour, as they show no signs of interest in the human well-being. But, when the philosopher suddenly witnesses, how the School of Athens is bruised down by one of the god's foot, killing everyone inside, he decides to take action. Going from city to city, he convinces the people that the gods are no good for mankind, as they turn people into animals, impregnate women and kill innocents, and recruits them to form a giant mob. As the mob grows, the philosopher continues executing his plan to overthrow the gods, kill their minions, and form an ochlocracy, while his mob destroys everything standing in their way.\n\n\"Okhlos\" is often compared to \"Pikmin\", as the player rules over a huge mob, directing it to go to the commanded spots, in combination with \"Katamari\" for the fast-paced action. Upon touching, the mob will automatically start tearing down buildings, attack enemies or recruit new people. Additionally, the player can make the mob block or spread around the city they are in to protect the player from enemies or hazards. The game's eight worlds are procedurally generated, each featuring different hazards and enemies to face. Every city includes shops, in which the player may buy upgrades for individual units of the mob, or increase the number of people able to join it. To that, the player may, in the shops, also trade units for famous Greek philosophers and heroes, such as Aristotle and Heracles. Over the course of the game, the player will face and battle all of the Twelve Olympians, as well as randomly encountering other major enemies, like the Oracle of Delphi or the Minotaur. In case the player dies, he will take over one of the philosophers from the mob, except if there is no philosophers left, which will cause the player to lose.\n\nDevelopment on \"Okhlos\" started in November 2012, after Argentinian indie studio Coffee Powered Machine released the \"Enhanced Edition\" of their previous title, \"Gravity Fleet\", to the App Store on 13 November 2012. The team decided to create a game about an angry mob in ancient Greece, consisting of mythological heroes, that is fighting the Olympian gods. The team started off working on the non-player character's flocking behavior, and continued working on core mechanics for the game's \"angry mob\" concept. When procedural generation was implemented into the game, the team was unhappy about its simple algorithm and instead shifted their design focus to static, pre-built worlds. A longer silent development phase took place, until they revealed the new designs and mechanics, and also the different gameplay types the tested, on 26 June 2013. A total of 24 prototypes were created, which included, but was not limited to, a beat 'em up, a stealth game and the roguelike style the decided to build on. Another successful six months of development went by, to the point, where Coffee Powered Machine decided to get to work on the procedural generation algorithm again, and therefore dropped the static worlds in early 2014. However, the project nearly ceased, as the team ran out of money shortly after, but where help up by private investors. The development could continue and the team made a lot of progress by the end of 2014. This progress later led to the game being sent to the Independent Games Festival 2015, which was held from 2 March 2015 until 6 March 2015 in San Francisco, California. Additionally, it was announced to be featured in the Leftfield Collection at EGX Rezzed 2015, which took place from 12 March 2015 to 14 March 2015 in London, United Kingdom. Due to the good reputation, Coffee Powered Machine submitted the game to Steam Greenlight on 12 May 2015, which was eventually greenlit just six days after, namely, on 18 May 2015, to which pre-orders were opened. The game's growing popularity then brought the team to the third edition Brazil's Independent Games Festival, which was held from 27 June 2015 until 5 July 2015 in São Paulo, Brazil, where they won the \"Melhor Gameplay\" (\"Best Gameplay\") award. New big news arose, as Devolver Digital announced that they had signed-up with Coffee Powered Machine for a publishing deal for \"Okhlos\", on 25 August 2015. Devolver Digital then brought \"Okhlos\" onto the stage of PAX Prime 2015 in Seattle, Washington, United States. On 25 January 2016, it was announced that the game will be released in March or April 2016, however, it was delayed to June 2016, and finally, as announced on 28 July 2016, was released on 18 August 2016.\n"}
{"id": "7280451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7280451", "title": "Polytheistic myth as psychology", "text": "Polytheistic myth as psychology\n\nThe idea of polytheistic myth as having psychological value is one theorem of archetypal psychology as defined by James Hillman, and explored in current Jungian mythology literature. Myth itself, according to Joseph Campbell, represents the human search for what is true, significant, and meaningful. He says what we are seeking is “…an experience of being alive…so that our life experiences…will have resonances within our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive”. According to proponents of this theory, polytheistic myths can provide psychological insight.\n\nChristine Downing recounts the Greek view of the gods as energies that affect everyone. In so being they are referred to \"as \"theos\", that is, as immortal, permanent, ineluctable aspects of the world\". Disputes among the Greek pantheon were frequent, yet, Downing emphasizes, no god of the Classical era ever denied the existence of another god. And she cautions us as humans that to deny even one of the pantheon diminishes the richness of individuals and of the world.\n\nFor Carl Gustav Jung, the primary function of myth is psychological — to shed light on the workings of the unconscious. The cornerstone of his therapeutic approach is working with a patient’s dreams and fantasies. To be of help, then, it is imperative to have knowledge of the details of the patient’s life as well as knowledge of “…symbols, and therefore of mythology and the history of religions”. Jung implies the diversity of psychic energies inhabiting the unconscious. He also cautions us to know these energies rather than force them into one’s shadow lest one’s “…moods, nervous states, and delusions make it clear in the most painful way that [one] is not the only master in his house…\" \n\nThomas Moore says of James Hillman’s teaching that he “portrays the psyche as inherently multiple”. In Hillman’s archetypal/polytheistic view, the psyche or soul has many directions and sources of meaning—and this can feel like an ongoing state of conflict—a struggle with one’s daimons. According to Hillman, “polytheistic psychology can give sacred differentiation to our psychic turmoil…”. Furthermore, Hillman states that, \"The power of myth, its reality, resides precisely in its power to seize and influence psychic life. The Greeks knew this so well, and so they had no depth psychology and psychopathology such as we have. They had myths. And we have no myths as such -instead, depth psychology and psychopathology. Therefore... psychology shows myths in modern dress and myths show our depth psychology in ancient dress.\" Hillman qualifies his many references to gods as differing from a literalistic approach saying that for him they are \"aides memoires\", i.e. sounding boards employed \"for echoing life today or as bass chords giving resonance to the little melodies of life.\" Hillman further insists that he does not view the pantheon of gods as a 'master matrix' against which we should measure today and thereby decry modern loss of richness. \n\nOther proponents of this view are Jean Shinoda Bolen and Ginette Paris.\n"}

{"id": "664230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=664230", "title": "Rhythm section", "text": "Rhythm section\n\nA rhythm section (also called a backup band) is a group of musicians within a music ensemble or band who provide the underlying rhythm, harmony and pulse of the accompaniment, providing a rhythmic and harmonic reference and \"beat\" for the rest of the band. Many of the rhythm section instruments, such as keyboard instruments and guitars, are used to play the chord progression upon which the song is based. The bass instrument (either double bass or electric bass, or another low-register instrument, such as synth bass, depending on the group and its style of music) plays the low-pitched bassline that supports the chord progression, typically by emphasizing the roots of the chords (and to a lesser degree the fifths and thirds of the chords).\n\nThe term is common in modern small musical ensembles, such as bands that play jazz, country, blues, and rock. In modern rock music, a rhythm guitarist specializes in rhythmic and chordal playing (as opposed to the melodic guitar solos and lead melody lines played by the lead guitar), often repeating quaver (eighth-note), half note or whole note chords. In the louder genres, such as hard rock, heavy metal and punk rock, rhythm guitarists often play power chords with distortion. Rhythm guitarists often strum open chords in pop, rock, country and folk music and play barre chords in many pop and rock styles.\n\nA typical rhythm section comprises one or more guitars (either electric guitars, in rock music bands; acoustic guitars, in country music, folk music and blues or both electric and acoustic in some bands); and/or a keyboard instrument (piano, electric piano, Hammond organ, synthesizer, etc.) a double bass or electric bass (depending on the style of music), and drums (usually acoustic, but in some post-1980s styles, the drums may be electronic drums). In some styles of music, there may be additional percussionists playing instruments such as the djembe or shakers. Some styles of music often have two electric guitarists, such as rock genres like heavy metal music and punk rock. Some styles of music use multiple keyboard instrument performers simultaneously (e.g., piano and Hammond organ or electric piano and synthesizer) for a fuller sound. A rhythm section could be as small as two or three instruments (e.g., a guitarist and a bassist or a power trio of bass, drums and guitar) or it may be a fairly large ensemble with several keyboardists, several guitarists, auxiliary string players (mandolin, ukulele, etc.), a drummer and percussionists. The largest rhythm sections may be led by a bandleader or a conductor who indicates the tempo of each song, starts each song, leads slow-downs of the music at cadences (sections of songs where the music comes to rest on a chord), and indicates when to change soloists and how and when the song will end.\n\nThe instrumentalists used in a rhythm section vary according to the style of music and era. Modern pop, rock and jazz band rhythm sections typically consist of a drummer, a bass player, and one or more players of chordal instruments (e.g., a pianist, guitarist, etc.). The term \"rhythm section\" may also refer to the instruments in this group (named collectively the \"rhythm section instruments\").\n\nIn music industry parlance, the amplifiers and some of the instruments are nicknamed the \"backline.\" Backline instruments are commonly provided for bands at music festivals and other concerts where several bands will play during an event. By providing these backline instruments, this speeds up the changeover process when new bands take the stage. The backline typically includes large and heavy items that are hard to transport, including large bass amplifiers and guitar amplifiers and their speaker cabinets, the drum kit (usually minus the cymbals and the snare drum, which each drummer brings from home), a Hammond organ, stage piano, and a keyboard amplifier. Even when a venue or festival provides a \"backline\", musicians must still supply some instruments themselves, such as guitars, an electric bass, and, in some cases, the cymbals and/or the snare drum. The venue informs musicians about which instruments are supplied as the backline for a specific concert or stage and in many cases, the contract signed by the band and the venue/promoter contains an explicit list of the backline gear that will be on stage, even specifying brand names and model numbers.\n\nAlthough rhythm sections spend much of the time providing accompaniment (backing parts) for songs, in some cases, they provide other musical roles. In some songs or styles of music, instruments from the rhythm section may play soloistic roles on occasion (e.g., improvised guitar solos or solo breaks) or play a melodic role (e.g., a rhythm guitarist may play a lyrical countermelody behind a singer or a melodic intro line before the lead vocalist starts to sing). Since rhythm sections are generally providing the background music for lead instruments and solo singers, rhythm sections are typically not as prominent as a singer or soloist, and music fans tend to be more aware of lead singers than rhythm section members. However, since rhythm sections provide the underpinning for a good performance by the lead instruments and vocalists, good rhythm sections are valued in the music industry. Some of the most accomplished rhythm sections have become famous, such as The Band, the E Street Band and Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare (the latter in reggae). As well, in some popular bands, all of the band members, including rhythm section members, have become famous as individuals (e.g., the rhythm section members of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, etc.).\n\nIn almost all genres of popular music and traditional music that use rhythm sections, ranging from rock to country to jazz, the rhythm section members are expected to be able to improvise (make up) their parts or prepare their own parts for a given song by listening to the CD at home. Once the bassist and chord-playing instruments are provided with the chord progression on a lead sheet (in which chords are typically named using the root note of the chord and its quality; e.g., C Major, d minor, G7, etc.), they are expected to be able to improvise or prepare a bass line and chord voicings, respectively, that suit the style of the song. In each style of music, there are different musical approaches and styles that rhythm section members are expected to use. For example, in a country music song, the guitarist will be expected to be able to perform a chord progression using an intricate fingerpicking style; in a heavy metal song, the guitarist will be expected to play power chords and complex, precise rhythmic patterns; in a jazz song, a guitarist will be expected to be able to play \"jazz voicings\" of the chords, which emphasize the third, seventh and often the sixth or ninth chord tones (this contrasts with the barre chord voicings used in pop and rock, which emphasize the root, fifth, and to a lesser degree, the third of the chord). Drummers and percussionists are expected to be able to improvise or prepare rhythm parts that suit the style of a given song. In some cases, an arranger, orchestrator or composer will provide a written-out bass part or drum part written in music notation (the five-line staff in which the notes are round symbols with or without stems). It is rare in jazz or rock for chords to be written out in music notation; the arranger or songwriter typically writes the chord symbol and expects the guitarist to improvise the appropriate chord voicing.\nRhythm section members may be expected to sing backup vocals or harmony parts in some styles of music. In some styles of music, notably 2010s-era pop, hip hop music and funk, rhythm section members may be required to perform a rhythmic dance routine, which may range from a simple body movement to a complex dance choreography that requires significant dance skills. In some types of heavy metal music, rhythm section members (guitar, bass, drums) may be expected to be able to \"headbang\" (move their head in an up and down fashion in time with the beat) while performing. Less commonly, some rhythm section members may sing lead vocals (e.g., Phil Collins or Sting). In some groups, one rhythm section member may have other roles, such as bandleader (e.g., jazz bassist Charles Mingus), conductor (often the case in 2010s-era musical theatre shows), songwriter, composer or arranger.\n\nIn the case of swing bands, the classic rhythm section comprises a quartet of electric guitar, piano, double bass, and drums; a noted example is that of the Count Basie Orchestra with Freddie Green, the Count, Walter Page, and Jo Jones. Earlier jazz bands had used banjo in place of guitar, and other bass instruments such as the tuba for recording purposes prior to the advent of microphone technology in studios.\n\nAs bebop evolved, smaller jazz groups dropped the guitar, and many free jazz ensembles dropped the piano as well. Auxiliary percussion such as claves, bongos or maracas can also be used, especially in music influenced by strains from Latin America such as salsa and samba. In theory any instrument or instruments can provide a steady rhythm: for example, in the trio led by Jimmy Giuffre the late 1950s, the clarinet, valve trombone and guitar all switched between lead and supporting roles.\n\nIn the 1950s, some jazz bandleaders began to replace the double bass with the then-newly invented electric bass. However, the electric bass really made a big impact on jazz in the 1970s, with the advent of jazz rock and jazz fusion. The electric bass was much easier to amplify to stadium-filling volumes using large bass speaker cabinets and amplifiers than an upright bass. The electric bass also began to be used as an expressive solo instrument, as exemplified by the performances of Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke.\n\nIn the 1970s, the main chordal rhythm instruments were often electric instruments such as the Rhodes electric piano or electric clavinet, often run through effects units such as fuzz, phasers, or wah-wah pedals and amplified through loud keyboard amplifiers. The jazz fusion rhythm section followed the lead of the rock rhythm sections of the era, and used huge banks of speakers and powerful amplifiers to create a massive sound large enough for stadium concerts. In the later 1980s and subsequent decades, jazz fusion bands such as the Chick Corea Elektric Band used synthesizers in the rhythm section, both for chordal accompaniment and for synth bass parts.\n\nR&B and rock and roll groups in the 1950s emphasized rhythm, so their backup bands generally consisted only of the standard swing band rhythm section of guitar, piano, bass, and drums supporting a vocalist, and in some cases omitting the keyboards. The bass guitar took over from the double bass in the 1950s, and had almost completely taken over the bass role in the 1960s. As the 1960s progressed the term \"rhythm section\" as used in a pop music context sometimes came to refer to just the bass and drums. For example, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr of the Beatles were referred to as the band's rhythm section.\n\nIn the 1970s, chordal instruments such as the electric and/or acoustic guitar and various keyboards (piano, electric piano, Hammond organ, clavinet) continued to be used to augment the bass and drums in soul, funk, and reggae groups. The sound of late 1960s and 1970s rhythm sections was often given a unique tone and sound due to the use of effects units. Funk bass players would play through auto-wah or envelope follower pedals. Reggae guitarists would plug into echo pedals. Rock guitarists would run their electric guitars through distortion and wah pedals. Electric piano or clavinet players also used effects.\n\nIn the 1980s, many rock and pop bands continued to be based around the basic rock rhythm section established by 1960s and 1970s bands: electric bass, drums, and electric guitar or keyboards. In the 1980s, the first widely-affordable digital synthesizer, Yamaha's DX7, was released. The distinctive FM synthesis tone of the DX7 is a key part of the sound of many 1980s pop and dance singles. \n\nAs electronic effects became more sophisticated, with the development of digital signal processing, during the 1980s, there was some crossover between the roles played by electronic keyboards and electric guitar. Even though electronic keyboards or organs were the standard instruments used to create sustained \"pads\" of sound (e.g., held backing chords) for ballads, with the introduction of digital delay pedals and other modern effects, electric guitars could produce similar \"pads\" or \"walls of sound\". The Edge, the guitarist from the rock band U2, often used digital delay and reverb-drenched electric guitar arpeggios (chords played one note after the other) to create a shimmering, sustained \"pad\" for the group. These arpeggio pads created a sustained sound that was similar to the sound of an electronic keyboard. By the late 1980s, the price of digital effects pedals dropped, making these effects units available to the general public.\n\nDuring the 1980s era, rhythm sections in some styles of pop took an increasing turn towards electronic instruments. A 1980s-era dance pop band might be backed up by a rhythm section of a synth bass, electronic drums (or drum machine) and various synthesizer keyboards. In some 1980s and 1990s bands, live human rhythm sections were sometimes replaced by sequenced MIDI synthesizer rhythm tracks made in the studio. In the 1980s and 1990s, the roots rock scene went in the opposite direction from dance pop; roots rock favoured traditional instruments in the rhythm section such as acoustic piano, acoustic guitar, mandolin, pedal steel guitar, acoustic bass guitar and upright bass. Another 1980s-era trend that helped revive interest in acoustic instruments was the \"MTV Unplugged\" style of performances, in which a rock band performs with acoustic instruments, including acoustic guitars and an acoustic bass guitar.\n\nIn rock and pop, rhythm sections range in size from the barest, stripped-down size of the \"power trio\" (guitarist, bassist, and drummer) and the organ trio (Hammond organist, drummer, and a third instrument) to large rhythm sections with several stringed instrument players (mandolin, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, etc.), multiple keyboard players (e.g., piano, Hammond organ, electric piano, synth), two instruments playing a bass role (e.g., bass guitar and synth bass) and a group of auxiliary percussionists (congas, shakers, etc.) to fill out (or \"sweeten\") the sound. Some rhythm sections combine electronic/digital instruments that are sequenced, pre-recorded backup tracks and live instruments (including electric, electronic and acoustic instruments).\n\nThe drums and bass both supply a rhythmic pulse for the music, and the bass instrument supplies a harmonic foundation with a bassline. The types of basslines performed by the bass guitarist vary widely from one style of music to another. Despite all of the differences in the styles of bassline in most styles of popular music, the bass guitarist fulfills a similar role: anchoring the harmonic framework (often by emphasizing the roots of the chord progression) and laying down the beat (in collaboration with the drummer). The importance of the bass guitarist and the bass line varies in different styles of music. In some pop styles, such as 1980s-era pop and musical theater, the bass sometimes plays a relatively simple part, and the music forefronts the vocals and melody instruments. In contrast, in reggae or funk, entire songs may be centered around the bass groove, and the bassline is very prominent in the mix.\n\nSimilarly, the role of the drummer varies a great deal from one style of music to another. In some types of music, such as traditional 1950s-style country music, the drummer has a rudimentary \"timekeeping\" role, and the drums are placed low in the mix by the sound engineers. In styles such as progressive rock, metal, and jazz fusion, the drummers often perform complex, challenging parts, and the drums may be given a prominent placement in the mix; as well, the drummer may be often given prominent solo breaks, fills, or introductions that put the spotlight on their technical skills and musicality. In the more experimental forms of free jazz and jazz fusion, the drummer may not play the strict \"timekeeping\" role that is associated with drums in pop music. Instead, the drums may be used more to create textured polyrhythmic soundscapes. In this type of situation, the main pulse is often provided by the bass player rather than the drummer.\n\nThe rhythm section members sometimes break out of their accompaniment role when they are asked to perform keyboard solos, bass breaks, or drum solos. In genres such as progressive rock, art rock, or progressive metal, the rhythm section members may play complicated parts along with the lead guitar (or vocalist) and perform extended solos. In jazz groups and jazz fusion bands, the rhythm section members are often called on to perform improvised solos. In jazz, the drummer may \"trade\" short solo sections with a saxophone player or trumpet player; this practice, nicknamed \"trading fours\", typically involves the drummer and the horn player alternating four bar solo sections during a jazz tune. They can also trade eights, twos, ones, or other numbers depending on the musical context.\n\nIn organ trios, the lower octaves of a Hammond organ or electronic keyboard are used as a substitute for bass guitar or double bass. The organist can play the bassline using the bass pedal keyboard or using the lower manual. As well, the organist could play right-hand chords and melodies. Organ trios were a widely used type of jazz ensemble in the 1950s and 1960s to play hard bop.\n\nOrgan trios are sometimes used in rock as well. The Doors' keyboardist Ray Manzarek used a keyboard bass to play the bass lines. Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore would act as an organ trio with the addition of singer Jim Morrison.\n\nNew Orleans or Dixieland jazz bands occasionally use tuba, sousaphone, or bass saxophone in place of the double bass that was common in 1920s-era jazz bands. This tradition developed from the origins of New Orleans music in marching bands, which used instruments that could be carried on harnesses or with straps. Marching bands use a mixture of brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments, because all of these instruments can be played while marching.\n\nNot all rhythm sections follow the standard model of drummer-bassist-chordal instrument. Some bands have no drummer. In bands without a drummer, one or more instruments from the rhythm section often play in styles that replace the drum kit role—that is laying down the beat and backbeat. Traditional bluegrass bands typically do not have a drummer. In bluegrass bands, the timekeeping role is shared between several instruments: the upright bass generally plays the on-beats while the mandolin plays chop chords on the off-beats, with the banjo also keeping a steady eighth note rhythm.\n\nThis distributed nature allows for rhythmic continuity while players take turns highlighting the melody. In funk-oriented groups that do not have a drummer, the electric bass player may take over some of the drummer's role by using slap bass. With slap bass, the bassist slaps the low strings to create a strong \"thump\" (similar to the bass drum's role) and \"snaps\" or \"pops\" the high strings to create a percussive effect (the latter takes over some of the role played by the hi-hat cymbals). In some bands, there may be no bass player—the basslines may be played by the piano player, synth player, or guitarist. Using a guitar player to provide basslines is particularly effective if a guitar player has a seven-string guitar with a low \"B\" string. \n\nSome jazz duos consist of a singer accompanied by a single piano player. In these duos, the jazz piano player has a challenging task; she has to provide all of the rhythmic and harmonic foundation that would normally be provided by a full rhythm section. A jazz pianist accompanying a singer in a duo needs to play, all at the same time, a deep bassline, chords, and fill-in melody lines while the singer is performing. As well, the pianist often improvises an instrumental solo in between her vocal melodies.\n"}
{"id": "3043758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3043758", "title": "Script (comics)", "text": "Script (comics)\n\nA script is a document describing the narrative and dialogue of a comic book in detail. It is the comic book equivalent of a television program teleplay or a film screenplay.\n\nIn comics, a script may be preceded by a plot outline, and is almost always followed by page sketches, drawn by a comics artist and inked, succeeded by the coloring and lettering stages. There are no prescribed forms of comic scripts, but there are two dominant styles in the mainstream comics industry, the \"full script\" (commonly known as \"DC style\") and the \"plot script\" (or \"Marvel style\").\n\nIn this style, the comics writer (also comics scripter, comic book writer, comics author, comic book author, graphic novel writer, graphic novel author or graphic novelist) breaks the story down in sequence, page-by-page and panel-by-panel, describing the action, characters, and sometimes backgrounds and \"camera\" points-of-view of each panel, as well as all captions and dialogue balloons. For decades, this was the preferred format for books published by DC Comics.\n\nPeter David described his specific application of the full script method: \"I break down each page on a panel by panel basis and label them as PANEL A, PANEL B, and so on. Then I describe what's in each panel, and then do the dialogue, numbering the balloons. I designate the panels with letters and the word balloons with numbers so as to minimize confusion for the letterer.\"\n\nIn a plot script the artist works from a story synopsis from the writer (or plotter), rather than a full script. The artist creates page-by-page plot details on his or her own, after which the work is returned to the writer for the insertion of dialogue. Due to its widespread use at Marvel Comics beginning in the 1960s, primarily under writer-editor Stan Lee and artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, this approach became commonly known as the Marvel method or Marvel house style.\n\nComics historian Mark Evanier writes that this \"new means of collaboration . . . was born of necessity—Stan was overburdened with work—and to make use of Jack's great skill with storylines. . . . Sometimes Stan would type up a written plot outline for the artist. Sometimes, not.\" As comic-book writer-editor Dennis O'Neil describes, the Marvel method \". . . requires the writer to begin by writing out a plot and add[ing] words when the penciled artwork is finished. . . .[I]n the mid-sixties, plots were seldom more than a typewritten page, and sometimes less,\" while writers in later times \"might produce as many as twenty-five pages of plot for a twenty-two page story, and even include in them snatches of dialog. So a Marvel Method plot can run from a couple of paragraphs to something much longer and more elaborate.\"\n\nThe Marvel method was in place with at least one artist by early 1961, as Lee described in 2009 when speaking of his and Ditko's \"short, five-page filler strips ... placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill\", most prominently in \"Amazing Fantasy\" but even previously in \"Amazing Adventures\" and other \"pre-superhero Marvel\" science-fiction/fantasy anthology titles. \"I'd dream up odd fantasy tales with an O. Henry type twist ending. All I had to do was give Steve a one-line description of the plot and he'd be off and running. He'd take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect.\"\n\nThe October 2018 issue of DC Comics' in-house previews magazine, \"DC Nation\", featured a look at the creative process that writer Brian Michael Bendis and artists Ryan Sook, Wade von Grawbadger and Brad Anderson employed on \"Action Comics\" #1004, which included pages of Bendis' script that were broken down panel by panel, albeit without dialogue.\n\nAdvantages of the Marvel method over the full script method that have been cited by creators and industry professionals include (1) the artist is more visually-minded and thus often has a better notion of how a scene should play out, (2) it gives the artist more freedom, and (3) it lightens the burden on the writer. Cited disadvantages include (1) not all talented artists are talented writers, and some struggle over aspects such as plot ideas and pacing, (2) it takes advantage of artists, who are typically paid for art alone even though they are essentially working as co-writers, and (3) the artist's development of a story may clash with the writer's style.\n\nIn a variation of the plot script, attributed to Harvey Kurtzman, the writer breaks down the story into page roughs or thumbnail sketches, with captions and dialogue jotted down inside the roughs. The artist (who is often the comic's writer as well) then fleshes out the roughs onto full-size art board. Writer/artists Frank Miller and Jeff Smith favor this style, as did Archie Goodwin.\n\nAttributed to William Gaines (Kurtzman’s publisher at EC Comics), the EC style is similar to the Kurtzman Style, except the writer submits a tight plot to an artist, who breaks it down into panels that are laid out on the art board. The writer writes all captions and dialogue, which are pasted inside these panels, and then the artist draws the story to fit all of this paste-up. This laborious and restrictive way of creating comics is no longer in general use; the last artist to use even a variation of EC style was the late Jim Aparo.\n\n"}

{"id": "1442169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1442169", "title": "Shadow play", "text": "Shadow play\n\nShadow play, also known as shadow puppetry, is an ancient form of storytelling and entertainment which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or scrim. The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.\n\nShadow play is popular in various cultures, among both children and adults in many countries around the world. More than 20 countries are known to have shadow show troupes. Shadow play is an old tradition and it has a long history in Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia. It has been an ancient art and a living folk tradition in China, India and Nepal. It is also known in Egypt, Turkey, Greece, Germany, France and the United States.\n\nShadow play probably developed from \"par\" shows with narrative scenes painted on a large cloth and the story further related through song. As the shows were mostly performed at night the par was illuminated with an oil lamp. Shadow puppet theatre likely originated in Central Asia-China or in India in the 1st millennium BCE. By at least around 200 BCE the figures on cloth seem to have been replaced with puppetry in Indian \"tholu bomalatta\" shows. These are performed behind a thin screen with flat, jointed puppets made of colorfully painted transparent leather. The puppets are held close to the screen and lit from behind, while hands and arms are manipulated with attached canes and lower legs swinging freely from the knee.\nThe evidence of shadow puppet theatre is found in both ancient Chinese and Indian texts. The most significant historical centers of shadow play theatre have been China, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAccording to Martin Banham, there is little mention of indigenous theatrical activity in the Middle East between the 3rd century CE and the 13th-century, including the centuries that followed the Islamic conquest of the region. The shadow puppet play, states Banham, probably came into vogue in the Middle East after the Mongol invasions and thereafter it incorporated local innovations by the 16th-century. Little mention of shadow play is found in Islamic literature of Iran, but much is found in Turkish and 19th-century Ottoman Empire influenced territories.\n\nWhile shadow play theatre is an Asian invention, hand puppets have a long history in Europe. As European merchant ships sailed in the search of sea routes to India and China, they helped diffuse popular entertainment arts and cultural practices into Europe. Shadow theatre became popular in France, Italy, Britain and Germany by the 17th-century. In France, shadow play was advertised as \"Ombres Chinoises\", while elsewhere they were called \"Magic Lantern\". Goethe helped build a shadow play theatre in Tiefurt in 1781.\n\nAccording to Stephen Herbert, the popular shadow theatre evolved nonlinearly into projected slides and ultimately into cinematography. The common principle in these innovations were the creative use of light, images and a projection screen. According to Olive Cook, there are many parallels in the development of shadow play and modern cinema, such as their use of music, voice, attempts to introduce colors and mass popularity.\n\nShadow puppets have been a part of ancient Indian culture, particularly regionally as the \"Keelu Bomme\" and \"Tholu Bommalata\" of Andhra Pradesh, the \"Togalu Gombeyaata\" in Karnataka, the \"Charma Bahuli Natya\" in Maharashtra, the \"Ravanachhaya\" in Odisha, the \"Tholpava Koothu\" in Kerala and the \"Thol Bommalatta\" in Tamil Nadu. Shadow puppet play is also found in pictorial traditions in India, such as temple mural painting, loose-leaf folio paintings, and the narrative paintings. Dance forms such as the Chhau of Odisha literally mean shadow. The shadow theatre dance drama theatre are usually performed on platform stages attached to Hindu temples, and in some regions these are called \"Koothu Madams\" or \"Koothambalams\". In many regions, the puppet drama play is performed by itinerant artist families on temporary stages during major temple festivals. Legends from the Hindu epics \"Ramayana\" and the \"Mahabharata\" dominate their repertoire. However, the details and the stories vary regionally.\n\nDuring the 19th-century and early parts of the 20th-century of the colonial era, Indologists believed that shadow puppet plays had become extinct in India, though mentioned in its ancient Sanskrit texts. In the 1930s and thereafter, states Stuart Blackburn, these fears of its extinction were found to be false as evidence emerged that shadow puppetry had remained a vigorous rural tradition in central Kerala mountains, most of Karnataka, northern Andhra Pradesh, parts of Tamil Nadu, Odisha and southern Maharashtra. The Marathi people, particularly of low caste, had preserved and vigorously performed the legends of Hindu epics as a folk tradition. The importance of Marathi artists is evidenced, states Blackburn, from the puppeteers speaking Marathi as their mother tongue, in many non-Marathi speaking states of India.\nAccording to Beth Osnes, the \"Tholu Bommalata\" shadow puppet theatre dates back to 3rd-century BCE, and has attracted patronage ever since. The puppets used in a \"Tholu Bommalata\" performance, states Phyllis Dircks, are \"translucent, lusciously multicolored leather figures four to five feet tall, and feature one or two articulated arms\". The process of making the puppets is an elaborate ritual, where the artist families in India pray, go into seclusion, produce the craved and incised art work, then celebrate the \"metaphorical birth of a puppet\" with flowers and incense.\n\nThe \"Tholu Pava Koothu\" performance of Kerala uses leather puppets whose images are projected on backlit screen. The shadows are used to creatively express characters and stories in the \"Ramayana\". A complete performance of the epic can take forty one nights, while an abridged performance lasts as few as seven days. One feature of the \"Tholu Pava Koothu\" show is that it is a team performance of puppeteers, while other shadow plays such as \"Wayang\" of Indonesia is performed by a single puppeteer for the same \"Ramayana\" story. There are regional differences within India in the puppet arts. For example, women play a major role in shadow play theatre in most parts of India, except in Kerala and Maharashtra. Almost everywhere, except Odisha, the puppets are made from tanned deer skin, painted and articulated. Translucent leather puppets are typical in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, while opaque are typical in Kerala and Odisha. The artist troupes typically carry over a hundred puppets for their performance in rural India.\n\nShadow puppet theatre is called Wayang in Indonesia, wherein a dramatic story is told through shadows thrown by puppets and sometimes combined with human characters. The art form celebrates the Indonesian culture and artistic talent, its origins are traced to medieval era spread of Hinduism and the arrival of leather-based puppet arts called \"Tholu bommalata\" from southern India. Around 860 CE an Old Javanese charter issued by Maharaja Sri Lokapala mentions three sorts of performers: atapukan, aringgit, and abanol. Ringgit is described in an 11th-century Javanese poem as a leather shadow figure.\n\n\"Wayang kulit\", a style of Wayang shadow play, is particularly popular in Java and Bali. The term derived from the word \"wayang\" literally means \"shadow\" or imagination in Javanese, also connotes \"spirit\". The word \"kulit\" means skin, as the material from which the puppet is made is thin perforated leather sheets made from buffalo skin.\n\nThe performances of shadow puppet theater in Bali is typically at night, lasting until dawn. The complete \"wayang kulit\" troupes include \"dalang\" (puppet master), \"nayaga\" (gamelan players), and \"sinden\" (female choral singer). Some of the \"nayaga\" also performed as male choral singer. The \"dalang\" (puppet master) play/ed the wayang behind the cotton screen illuminated by oil lamp or modern halogen lamp, creating visual effects similar to animation. The flat puppet has moveable joints that are animated by hand, using rods connected to the puppet. The handle of the rod is made of carved buffalo horn. On November 7, 2003, UNESCO designated \"wayang kulit\" from Indonesia as one of the \"Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity\".\n\nThe shadow play is called \"Nang Sbek Thom\", or simply as \"Sbek Thom\" (literally \"large leather hide\"), \"Sbek Touch\" (\"small leather hide\") and \"Sbek Por\" (\"colored leather hide\") in Cambodia.\n\nIt is performed during sacred temple ceremonies, at private functions, and for the public in the villages. The popular plays include Ramayana and Mahabharata epics, also other Hindu myth and legends. The performance is accompanied with Pinpeat orchestra in Cambodia.\n\nThe \"Sbek Thom\" is based on the Cambodian version of the Indian epic \"Ramayana\", an epic story about good and evil involving Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Hanuman and Ravana. It is a sacred performance, embodying Khmer beliefs built on the foundations and mythologies of Brahmanism and Buddhism.\n\nCambodian shadow puppet are made of cow hide, and their size are usually quite large depicting a whole scene, the character including its background. Unlike its Javanese counterpart, Cambodian shadow puppets are usually not articulated which rendered the figure's hands unmovable, and also left uncolored which retains its original leather color. Main shadow puppet production center is Roluos near Siem Reap. The Cambodian shadow puppet is one of the cultural performances being staged for tourist next to Cambodian traditional dances.\n\nThe \"Sbek Thom\" figures are unlike puppets because they are large and heavy, with no moveable parts. The \"Sbek Touch\", in contrast, are like puppets with movable parts, much smaller and their shows have been more popular. The \"Sbek Thom\" shadow play involves many puppeteers dancing on the screen, each puppeteer playing one character of the \"Ramayana\", while separate narrators recite the story accompanied with an orchestra.\n\nShadow theatre in Thailand is called \"Nang yai\"; in the south there is a tradition called \"Nang Talung\". Nang Yai puppets are normally made of cowhide and rattan. Performances are normally accompanied by a combination of songs and chants. Performances in Thailand were temporarily suspended in 1960 due to a fire at the national theatre. Nang drama has influenced modern Thai cinema, including filmmakers like Cherd Songsri and Payut Ngaokrachang.\n\nIn Malaysia, shadow puppet plays are also known as \"wayang kulit\". In both Javanese and Malay, \"Wayang\" means shadow or imagination, while \"Kulit\" means skin and refers to the leather that puppets are made from. Stories presented are usually mythical and morality tales. There is an educational moral to the plays which usually portray a battle between Malay shadow plays are sometimes considered one of the earliest examples of animation. The wayang kulit in northern states of Malaysia such as Kelantan is influenced and similar to Thai shadow puppets, while the wayang kulit in southern Malay peninsula, especially in Johor is brought from Javanese Indonesian wayang kulit with slightly different on the story and performance.\n\nThe puppets are made primarily of leather and manipulated with sticks or buffalo horn handles. Shadows are cast using an oil lamp or, in modern times, a halogen light, onto a cotton cloth background. They are often associated with gamelan music.\n\nThere are several myths and legends about the origins of shadow puppetry in China. The most famous one has it that Chinese shadow puppetry originated when the favorite concubine of Emperor Wu of Han (156 BCE – 87 BCE) died and magician Shao-weng promised to raise her spirit. The emperor could see a shadow that looked like her move behind the curtains that the magician had placed around some lit torches. It is often told that the magician used a shadow puppet, but the original text in \"Book of Han\" gives no reason to believe in a relation to shadow puppetry. Although there are many earlier records of all kinds of puppetry in China, clear mention of Chinese shadow play does not occur until the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127). A 1235 book mentions that the puppets were initially cut out of paper, but later made of colored leather or parchment. The stories were mostly based on history and half fact half fiction, but comedies were also performed.\n\nShadow theatre became quite popular as early as the Song Dynasty when holidays were marked by the presentation of many shadow plays. During the Ming Dynasty there were 40 to 50 shadow show troupes in the city of Beijing alone. The earliest shadow theatre screens were made of mulberry paper. The storytellers generally used the art to tell events between various war kingdoms or stories of Buddhist sources. Today, puppets made of leather and moved on sticks are used to tell dramatic versions of traditional fairy tales and myths. In Gansu province, it is accompanied by Daoqing music, while in Jilin, accompanying Huanglong music forms some of the basis of modern opera.\n\nChinese shadow puppetry is shown in the 1994 Zhang Yimou film \"To Live\".\n\nThe origins of Taiwan's shadow puppetry can be traced to the Chaochow school of shadow puppet theatre. Commonly known as leather monkey shows or leather shows, the shadow plays were popular in Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung as early as the Qing dynasty (1644-1911 A.D.). Older puppeteers estimate that there were at least a hundred shadow puppet troupes in southern Taiwan in the closing years of the Qing. Traditionally, the eight to 12-inch puppet figures, and the stage scenery and props such as furniture, natural scenery, pagodas, halls, and plants are all cut from leather. As shadow puppetry is based on light penetrating through a translucent sheet of cloth, the \"shadows\" are actually silhouettes seen by the audience in profile or face on. Taiwan's shadow plays are accompanied by Chaochow melodies which are often called \"priest's melodies\" owing to their similarity with the music used by Taoist priests at funerals. A large repertoire of some 300 scripts of the southern school of drama used in shadow puppetry and dating back to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries has been preserved in Taiwan and is considered to be a priceless cultural asset.\n\nA number of terms are used to describe the different forms.\n\n\nA more bawdy comedy tradition of shadow play was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire, possibly since the late 14th century. It was centered around the contrasting interaction between the figures Karagöz and Hacivat: an unprincipled peasant and his fussy, educated companion. Together with other characters they represented all the major ethnic and social groups in Ottoman culture. It was usually performed by a single puppet master, who voiced up to dozens of characters, and could be assisted by an apprentice handing him the puppets. The show could be introduced by a singer, accompanied by a tambourine player. Its origins are obscure, though probably deriving from an Asian source.\n\nKaragöz theatre puppets have jointed limbs and are made from camel or buffalo hide. The hide is made transparent and colored, resulting in colorful projections. Puppets are typically 35–40 centimeters in height.\n\nDuring the 19th century these characters were adapted to the Greek language and culture, \"Karagöz and Hacivat\" becoming Karagiozis and Hadjiavatis with each of the characters assuming stereotypically Greek personalities. This tradition thrived throughout Greece after independence as popular entertainment for a largely adult audience, particularly before competition arose from television. The stories did, however, retain the period setting in the late years of the Ottoman Empire. Karagiozis theatre has undergone some revival in recent years, with the intended audience tending to be largely juvenile.\n\nKaragöz theatre was also adapted in Egypt and North Africa.\n\nVia Italy the shadow theatre spread throughout Europe at the end of the 17th century. It is known that several Italian showmen performed in Germany, France and England during this period.\nIn 1675 German polymath and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz imagined a kind of world exhibition that would show all kinds of new inventions and spectacles. In a handwritten document he supposed it should include shadow theatre.\n\nFrench missionaries had taken the shadow show from China to France in 1767 and put on performances in Paris and Marseilles, causing quite a stir. In time, the \"Ombres chinoises\" (French for \"Chinese Shadows\") with local modification and embellishment, became the \"Ombres françaises\" and struck root in the country. The popularity of Ombres chinoises reflected the chinoiserie fashion of the days.\n\nFrench showman François Dominique Séraphin first presented his shadow spectacle in a hôtel particulier in Versailles in 1771. He would go on to perform at the Palace of Versailles in front of royalty. In 1784 Séraphin moved to Paris, performing his shows at his permanent theatre in the newly opened Palais-Royal from 8 September 1784. The performances would adapt to the political changes and survived the French Revolution. Séraphin developed the use of clockwork mechanisms to automate the show. His nephew took over the show after Séraphin's death in 1800 and it was continued by his heirs until the theatre closed in 1870.\n\nIn 1775 Ambrogio (also known as Ambroise and Ambrose) staged ambitious shows in Paris and London.\nThe art was a popular entertainment in Paris during the 19th century, especially in the famous Paris nightclub district of Montmartre. The cabaret Le Chat noir (\"The Black Cat\") produced 45 \"Théatre d'ombres\" shows between 1885 and 1896 under the management of Rodolphe Salis. Behind a screen on the second floor of the establishment, the artist Henri Rivière worked with up to 20 assistants in a large, oxy-hydrogen back-lit performance area and used a double optical lantern to project backgrounds. Figures were originally cardboard cut-outs, but were replaced with zinc figures since 1887. Various artists took part in the creation, including Steinlen, Adolphe Willette and Albert Robida. Caran d'Ache designed circa 50 cut-outs for the very popular 1888 show \"L'Epopée\". Musée d'Orsay has circa 40 original zinc figures in its collection. Other cabarets would produce their own versions and the \"Ombres\" evolved into numerous theatrical productions and had a major influence on phantasmagoria.\nIn Italy, the Museum of Precinema collezione Minici Zotti in Padua houses a collection of 70 French shadow puppets, similar to those used in the cabaret Le Chat Noir, together with an original theatre and painted backdrops, as well as two magic lanterns for projecting scenes. So far, the shadow plays identified are \"La Marche a l'étoile\" (introduced by Henri Rivière), \"Le Sphinx\" (introduced by Amédée Vignola), \"L'Âge d'or\" and \"Le Carneval de Venise\", and it is supposed that the shadow puppets were created for a tour in France or abroad at the end of the 19th century.\n\nNowadays, several theatre companies in France are developing the practice of shadow puppets: Le Théâtre des Ombres, Le Théâtre du Petit Miroir, Le Théâtre Les Chaises, and La Loupiote.\n\nRichard Bradshaw is a famous Australian shadow puppeteer. His character \"Super Kangaroo\" is just one in his varied repertoire. The skill of Bradshaw has been featured in television programs made by Jim Henson.\n\nThe Shadow Theatre of Anaphoria (relocated to Australia from California) combines a mixture of reconstructed and original puppets with multiple sources of lights. The company is under the direction of Kraig Grady.\n\nAustralian Indie Company \"Shadowplay Studios\"' debut game \"Projection: First Light\" is inspired classic by shadow puppetry and its art style replicates the tradition shadow play canvas using black props and sepia backgrounds. They visited Richard Bradshaw to gain more insight into shadow puppetry to make their game more authentic by getting references for creating the games shadow puppet characters.\n\nIn the 1910s the German animator Lotte Reiniger pioneered silhouette animation as a format, whereby shadow-play-like puppets are filmed frame-by-frame. This technique has been kept alive by subsequent animators and is still practised today, though cel animation and computer animation has also been used to imitate the look of shadow play and silhouette animation. Traditional Chinese shadow puppetry was brought to audiences in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s through the efforts of Pauline Benton. Contemporary artists such as Annie Katsura Rollins have perpetuated the medium, sometimes combining the form with Western theatre.\n\nShadow theatre itself is still popular in many parts of Asia. Prahlad Acharya is one famous Indian magician who incorporates it into his performances.\n\nIn the 2010s, performer Tom McDonagh introduced 3-D shadow puppets and use of laser-cut objects.\n\nIt also appears occasionally in western popular culture, for example in:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "65434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65434", "title": "Sin City", "text": "Sin City\n\nSin City is a series of neo-noir comics by American comic book writer Frank Miller. The first story originally appeared in \"Dark Horse Presents Fifth Anniversary Special\" (April 1991), and continued in \"Dark Horse Presents\" #51–62 from May 1991 to June 1992, under the title of \"Sin City\", serialized in thirteen parts. Several other stories of variable lengths have followed. The intertwining stories, with frequently recurring characters, take place in Basin City.\n\nA film adaptation of \"Sin City\", co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, was released on April 1, 2005. A sequel, \"\", was released on August 22, 2014. Dimension Films is developing a soft reboot of the series for television, Stephen L’Heureux who produced the second film will oversee the series with Sin City creator Frank Miller. This will be with new characters and timelines and be more like the comics rather than the films.\n\nWriter-artist Frank Miller rose to fame within the American comics industry with his 1981–1983 work on Marvel Comics' \"Daredevil\", and the 1986 DC Comics miniseries \"The Dark Knight Returns\", both of which exhibited subtle elements of film noir. Miller's venture into the film noir genre would deepen with his creator-owned series \"Sin City\", which began publishing in serialized form in the Dark Horse Comics anthology series \"Dark Horse Presents\" #51–62. The story was released in a trade paperback, and later re-released in 1995 under the name \"\".\n\nIn a 2016 interview with the Kubert School, Miller explained his inspiration for \"Sin City\" thus:\n\nI've been a fanatic for a long time for old crime movies and old crime novels. But it started with the movies. And the old Cagney movies. Bogart and all that. I loved just how the morals of the stories are. They're all about right and wrong. But in \"Sin City\" in particular I wanted them all to happen to in a world where virtuous behavior was rare, which greatly resembled the world I lived in. It's kinda like the old Rolling Stones song, where every cop's a criminal, and all the sinners are saints, where the lowlifes would often be heroic, and the most stridently beautiful and sweet women would be prostitutes. I wanted it to be a world out of balance, where virtue is defined by individuals in difficult situations, not by an overwhelming sense of goodness that was somehow governed by this godlike Comics Code.\n\nThe film noir influence on the series' artwork is seen in its use of shadow and stark backgrounds. Black and white are the sole colors most of the time, with exception of red, yellow, blue, and pink, of which limited used is made in some stories to draw attention to particular characters.\n\nThe writing style also draws heavily on detective and crime pulp fiction.\n\nMiller's \"Sin City\" work challenges some conventions of comic book form. The letters of onomatopoeic words like \"blam\" are often incorporated into scenes via lighting effects, or are suggested by the negative space between panels, or are created by the outline of the panels themselves. This is especially evident in early \"yarns,\" such as \"The Hard Goodbye\", which were more experimental.\n\nBasin City, almost universally referred to by the nickname \"Sin City\", is a fictional town in the American west. The climate is hot and arid, although Sacred Oaks is characterized as being heavily wooded. A major river runs through the city, which has an extensive waterfront. Usually twice a year, a major downpour comes, and the city is prone to heavy snowfall in the winter. Desert lizards and palm trees are common, while tar pits, desert areas, mountain ranges and flat farmland make up the landscape around the city.\n\nThe Basin City Police Department are more or less along the lines of paramilitary or SWAT, as they have to deal with incredibly high crime rates among criminals and civilians alike, which is why they have access to what most would consider \"heavy weaponry\" and full body armor. Those who make up the force have been described as commonly being lazy, cowardly and/or corrupt. Only a handful of the cops are honest, though frequently the wealthy of the city bribe the corrupt members of the police into performing their duty (usually as a result of some crime being committed or threatened against a member of their family)(Miller, 1991).\n\nDuring the California Gold Rush, the Roark family \"imported\" a large number of attractive women to keep the miners happy, making a fortune and turning a struggling mining camp into a thriving, bustling city. Over the years, as the Roark family migrated into other areas of business and power, these women ended up forming the district of Old Town, the prostitute quarter of the city where they rule with absolute authority. In addition, the people charged with governing the city, most of them from the Roark line, remained in power for generations, running it as they saw fit. (Miller, 1991).\n\nAs the various yarns progress, the audience gradually becomes familiar with key locations in and around Basin City:\n\n\n\nBecause a large majority of the residents of Basin City are criminals, there are several organizations and cartels central to the stories who are vying for monopoly over the various criminal enterprises in the city. Listed below are crime syndicates, gangs and other low-lifes who figure heavily in the Sin City mythos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther groups that have been seen or mentioned in the comics include:\n\n\nThese are the individual stories, usually referred to as \"yarns,\" set in Frank Miller's Sin City universe.\n\nThe stories have been collected into trade paperbacks and hardcover \"Library Editions\". There is also a collection of art, \"The Art of Sin City\". The hardcovers include two releases, which include Volume 1 (Books 1-4) and 2 (Books 5-7 and \"The Art of\"). Additionally, Dark Horse released an omnibus-style collection, \"Frank Miller's Big Damn Sin City\", containing all seven books and \"The Art of\" in one oversized volume.\n\nWhile \"The Hard Goodbye\" was the first story written, the first section of \"That Yellow Bastard\" is the first story chronologically. The Dwight-related stories fall in between these, with the short stories fleshing out the time between the main stories. Here is a rough chronology of the \"Yarns\":\n\n\nThe short stories \"Rats\", \"The Customer is Always Right\" and \"Daddy's Little Girl\" do not contain any of the series' regular characters, are not connected to the other stories, or do not give an idea of when the stories occur. \"Silent Night\" takes place sometime before \"The Hard Goodbye\" during the winter, as Marv is still quite alive and seen lumbering through one of Basin City's rare snow-storms. Robert Rodriguez stated that \"The Customer is Always Right\" occurs in between \"That Yellow Bastard\" and \"The Hard Goodbye\" on the \"Sin City: Recut and Extended DVD Edition\".\n\n\"Hell and Back\" does not fit into any particular time period. Manute is seen, alive with his false eye, suggesting that the events take place between \"A Dame to Kill For\" and \"The Big Fat Kill\" however, it is established that \"Hell and Back\" takes place over several cool nights in September; \"The Big Fat Kill\" took place on a hot summer night during a thunderstorm. (Potential reconciliation: Hell and Back AND The Big Fat Kill take place before September 21, if Miller is using any date before that as still, technically, \"the summer\".)\n\n\"Sin City: Family Values\" won the 1997 Eisner Awards.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3398345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3398345", "title": "Sound studies", "text": "Sound studies\n\nSound studies is an interdisciplinary field that to date has focused largely on the emergence of the concept of \"sound\" in Western modernity, with an emphasis on the development of sound reproduction technologies. The field first emerged in venues like the journal \"Social Studies of Science\" by scholars working in science and technology studies and communication studies; it has however greatly expanded and now includes a broad array of scholars working in music, anthropology, sound art, deaf studies, architecture, and many other fields besides. Important studies have focused on the idea of a \"soundscape\", architectural acoustics, nature sounds, the history of aurality in Western philosophy and nineteenth-century Colombia, Islamic approaches to listening, the voice, studies of deafness, loudness, and related topics. A foundational text is Jonathan Sterne's 2003 book \"The Audible Past\", though the field has retroactively taken as foundational two texts from 1977, Jacques Attali's \"Noise\" and R. Murray Schafer's \"The Soundscape\".\n\nInitial work in the field was criticized for focusing mainly on white male inventors in Euro-America. Consequently the field is currently in a period of expansion, with important texts coming out in recent years on sound, listening, and hearing as they relate to blackness, gender, and colonialism.\n\nTwo significant categories to what we hear and pay attention to are natural and technological sounds. According to R. Murray Schaeffer (through a survey of quotes in the literature), the proportion of nature sounds heard and noticed among European authors has decreased over the past two centuries from 43% to 20%, but not for North America, where it has stayed around 50%. Additionally, the proportion of technological sounds mentioned in literature has stayed around 35% for Europe, but decreased in North America. While technological increases have not been sonically noticed, the decrease in silence has been noticed, from 19% to 9%.\n\nFor the idea of listening, objects can be considered auditorily as compared to visually. The objects that are able to be experienced by sight and by sound can be thought of in a venn diagram, with mute and visible objects in the vision category, with aural and invisible objects in the sound category, and aural and visible objects in the overlapping category. Objects that do not fall into a specific category can be considered beyond the horizons of sound and sight. The common denominator for aural objects is movement.\n\nThree modes of listening have been recognized; causal listening, semantic listening, and reduced listening. Causal listening, the most common, consists of listening in order to gather ideas about its source. Sound in this case is informational and can be used to recognize voices, determine distance, or understand differences between humans and machines. Semantic listening is when a sound is not only heard but also processed. When a sound is given meaning and context, as seen in speech and fluent dialogue. Reduced listening focuses on the traits of the sound itself regardless of cause and meaning.\n\nSound is heard through space. But this defining of sound and space is further nuanced by their interdependent existence, creation, and dissolution. This idea of the acoustic environment and its social inextricability has become a source of interest within the field of sound studies. Critical to this contemporary discussion of the symbiotic social space and sonic space is R. Murray Schafer's concept of the soundscape. Schafer uses the term soundscape to describe \"a total appreciation of the sonic environment,\" and, through soundscape studies, attempts to more holistically understand \"the relationship between man and the sounds of his environment and what happens when those sounds change\". In understanding the environment as events being heard, the soundscape is indicative of the social conditions and characteristics that create it. In industrialized cities, the soundscape is industrial noises, in a rainforest the soundscape is the sound of nature, and in an empty space the soundscape is silence. Moreover, the soundscape is argued to foretell future societal trends. The soundscape is not just representative of the environment which surrounds it but it makes up its very essence. The soundscape is the environment on a wavelength that is auditory rather than tactile or visible, but very much as real.\n\nSchaffer's concept of the soundscape has become a hallmark of sound studies and is referenced, built upon, and criticized by writers from a wide breadth of disciplines and perspectives. Common themes explored through the analysis of the soundscape are the conflict between nature and industry, the impact of technology on sound production and consumption, the issue of cultural sound values and the evolution of acoustics, and the power dynamics of silence and noise.\n\nOur perception of a recorded sound's authenticity has been greatly impacted by the commercial influence of capitalism. Even the dead now profit from recordings they've made, making music more timeless than ever before. Bringing the past into the present generates a sense of familiarity which compels the public to engage in new forms of listening.\n\nIn a Memorex commercial involving Ella Fitzgerald and Chuck Mangione, Fitzgerald is unable to discern the difference between a live performance and a recording of Mangione playing the trumpet. This presents a scene to viewers which sells cassette tapes as ideal objects of high-fidelity, auditory preservation. What was once an autonomic experience of memory which integrated visual and auditory stimuli (live music) has become a consumable item which popularizes and commodifies sonic memory explicitly.\n\nPart of this shift in the dynamics of recorded sound has to do with a desire for noise reduction. This desire is representative of a mode of recording referred to by scholar James Lastra as \"telephonic:\" a mode in which sound is regarded as having hierarchically important qualities, with clarity and intelligibility being the most important aspects. This contrasts with phonographic recording, which generates a \"point of audition\" from which a sense of space can be derived, sacrificing quality for uniqueness and fidelity. This technique is often used in movies to demonstrate how a character hears something (such as muffled voices through a closed door). Through various forms of media, recorded music affects our perceptions and consumptive practices more often than we realize.\n\n\n\n"}

At first simply dramatizations of the ritual, particularly in those rituals connected with Christmas and Easter (see \"Mystery play\"), plays were eventually transferred from the monastery church to the chapter house or refectory hall and finally to the open air, and the vernacular was substituted for Latin. In the 12th century one finds the earliest extant passages in French appearing as refrains inserted into liturgical dramas in Latin, such as a Saint Nicholas (patron saint of the student clercs) play and a Saint Stephen play.\n\nDramatic plays in French from the 12th and 13th centuries:\n\nThe origins of farce and comic theatre remain equally controversial; some −literary historians believe in a non-liturgical origin (among \"jongleurs\" or in pagan and folk festivals), others see the influence of liturgical drama (some of the dramas listed above include farcical sequences) and monastic readings of Plautus and Latin comic theatre.\n\nNon-dramatic plays from the 12th and 13th centuries:\n\nSelect list of plays from the 14th and 15th centuries:\n\nIn the 15th century, the public representation of plays was organized and controlled by a number of professional and semi-professional guilds:\n\nGenres of theatre practiced in the Middle Ages in France:\n\n16th-century French theatre followed the same patterns of evolution as the other literary genres of the period. For the first decades of the century, public theatre remained largely tied to its long medieval heritage of mystery plays, morality plays, farces, and soties, although the miracle play was no longer in vogue. Public performances were tightly controlled by a guild system. The guild \"les Confrères de la Passion\" had exclusive rights to theatrical productions of mystery plays in Paris; in 1548, fear of violence or blasphemy resulting from the growing religious rift in France forced the Paris Parliament to prohibit performances of the mysteries in the capital, although they continued to be performed in other places. Another guild, the \"Enfants Sans-Souci\" was in charge of farces and soties, as too the \"Clercs de la Basoche\" who also performed morality plays. Like the \"Confrères de la Passion\", \"la Basoche\" came under political scrutiny (plays had to be authorized by a review board; masks or characters depicting living persons were not permitted), and they were finally suppressed in 1582. By the end of the century, only the \"Confrères de la Passion\" remained with exclusive control over public theatrical productions in Paris, and they rented out their theatre at the Hôtel de Bourgogne to theatrical troupes for a high price. In 1597, they abandoned this privilege.\n\nAlongside the numerous writers of these traditional works (such as the farce writers Pierre Gringore, Nicolas de La Chesnaye and André de la Vigne), Marguerite de Navarre also wrote a number of plays close to the traditional mystery and morality play.\n\nAs early as 1503 however, original language versions of Sophocles, Seneca, Euripides, Aristophanes, Terence and Plautus were all available in Europe and the next forty years would see humanists and poets both translating these classics and adapting them. In the 1540s, the French university setting (and especially — from 1553 on — the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by professors such as George Buchanan and Marc Antoine Muret which would leave a profound mark on the members of La Pléiade. From 1550 on, one finds humanist theatre written in French.\n\nThe influence of Seneca was particularly strong in humanist tragedy. His plays — which were essentially chamber plays meant to be read for their lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory — brought to many humanist tragedies a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action.\n\nHumanist tragedy took two distinct directions:\n\nDuring the height of the civil wars (1570–1580), a third category of militant theatre appeared:\n\nAlong with their work as translators and adaptors of plays, the humanists also investigated classical theories of dramatic structure, plot, and characterization. Horace was translated in the 1540s, but had been available throughout the Middle Ages. A complete version of Aristotle's \"Poetics\" appeared later (first in 1570 in an Italian version), but his ideas had circulated (in an extremely truncated form) as early as the 13th century in Hermann the German's Latin translation of Averroes' Arabic gloss, and other translations of the \"Poetics\" had appeared in the first half of the 16th century; also of importance were the commentaries on Aristotle's poetics by Julius Caesar Scaliger which appeared in the 1560s. The fourth century grammarians Diomedes and Aelius Donatus were also a source of classical theory. The sixteenth century Italians played a central role in the publishing and interpretation of classical dramatic theory, and their works had a major effect on French theatre. Lodovico Castelvetro's Aristote-based \"Art of Poetry\"(1570) was one of the first enunciations of the three unities; this work would inform Jean de la Taille's \"Art de la tragedie\" (1572). Italian theatre (like the tragedy of Gian Giorgio Trissino) and debates on decorum (like those provoked by Sperone Speroni's play \"Canace\" and Giovanni Battista Giraldi's play \"Orbecche\") would also influence the French tradition.\n\nIn the same spirit of imitation — and adaptation — of classical sources that had informed the poetic compositions of \"La Pléiade\", French humanist writers recommended that tragedy should be in five acts and have three main characters of noble rank; the play should begin in the middle of the action (in medias res), use noble language and not show scenes of horror on the stage. Some writers (like Lazare de Baïf and Thomas Sébillet) attempted to link the medieval tradition of morality plays and farces to classical theatre, but Joachim du Bellay rejected this claim and elevated classical tragedy and comedy to a higher dignity. Of greater difficulty for the theorists was the incorporation of Aristotle's notion of \"catharsis\" or the purgation of emotions with Renaissance theatre, which remained profoundly attached to both pleasing the audience and to the rhetorical aim of showing moral examples (exemplum).\n\nÉtienne Jodelle's \"Cléopâtre captive\" (1553) — which tells the impassioned fears and doubts of Cleopatra contemplating suicide — has the distinction of being the first original French play to follow Horace's classical precepts on structure (the play is in five acts and respects more or less the unities of time, place and action) and is extremely close to the ancient model: the prologue is introduced by a shade, there is a classical chorus which comments on the action and talks directly to the characters, and the tragic ending is described by a messenger.\n\nMellin de Saint-Gelais's translation of Gian Giorgio Trissino's \"La Sophonisbe\" — the first modern regular tragedy based on ancient models which tells the story of the noble Sophonisba's suicide (rather than be taken as captive by Rome) — was an enormous success at the court when performed in 1556.\n\nSelect list of authors and works of humanist tragedy: \n\nAlongside tragedy, European humanists also adapted the ancient comedic tradition and as early as the 15th century, Renaissance Italy had developed a form of humanist Latin comedy. Although the ancients had been less theoretical about the comedic form, the humanists used the precepts of Aelius Donatus (4th century AD), Horace, Aristotle and the works of Terence to elaborate a set of rules: comedy should seek to correct vice by showing the truth; there should be a happy ending; comedy uses a lower style of language than tragedy; comedy does not paint the great events of states and leaders, but the private lives of people, and its principle subject is love.\n\nAlthough some French authors kept close to the ancient models (Pierre de Ronsard translated a part of Aristophanes's \"Plutus\" at college), on the whole the French comedic tradition shows a great deal of borrowing from all sources: medieval farce (which continued to be immensely popular throughout the century), the short story, Italian humanist comedies and \"La Celestina\" (by Fernando de Rojas).\n\nSelect list of authors and works of Renaissance comedy: \n\nIn the last decades of the century, four other theatrical modes from Italy — which did not follow the rigid rules of classical theatre – flooded the French stage:\n\n\nBy the end of the century, the most influential French playwright — by the range of his styles and by his mastery of the new forms — would be Robert Garnier.\n\nAll of these eclectic traditions would continue to evolve in the \"baroque\" theatre of the early 17th century, before French \"classicism\" would finally impose itself.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, public theatrical representations in Paris were under the control of guilds, but in the last decades of the sixteenth century only one of these continued to exist: although \"les Confrèrie de la Passion\" no longer had the right to perform mystery plays (1548), they were given exclusive rights to oversee all theatrical productions in the capital and rented out their theatre (the Hôtel de Bourgogne) to theatrical troupes at a high price. In 1597, this guild abandoned its privilege which permitted other theatres and theatrical companies to eventually open in the capital.\n\nIn addition to public theatres, plays were produced in private residences, before the court and in the university. In the first half of the century, the public, the humanist theatre of the colleges and the theatre performed at court showed extremely divergent tastes. For example, while the tragicomedy was fashionable at the court in the first decade, the public was more interested in tragedy.\n\nThe early theatres in Paris were often placed in existing structures like tennis courts; their stages were extremely narrow, and facilities for sets and scene changes were often non-existent (this would encourage the development of the unity of place). Eventually, theatres would develop systems of elaborate machines and decors, fashionable for the chevaleresque flights of knights found in the tragicomedies of the first half of the century.\n\nIn the early part of the century, the theatre performances took place twice a week starting at two or three o'clock. Theatrical representations often encompassed several works, beginning with a comic prologue, then a tragedy or tragicomedy, then a farce and finally a song. Nobles sometimes sat on the side of the stage during the performance. Given that it was impossible to lower the house lights, the audience was always aware of each other and spectators were notably vocal during performances. The place directly in front of the stage, without seats—the \"parterre\"—was reserved for men, but being the cheapest tickets, the parterre was usually a mix of social groups. Elegant people watched the show from the galleries. Princes, musketeers and royal pages were given free entry. Before 1630, an honest woman did not go to the theatre.\n\nUnlike England, France placed no restrictions on women performing on stage, but the career of actors of either sex was seen as morally wrong by the Catholic Church (actors were excommunicated) and by the ascetic religious Jansenist movement. Actors typically had fantastic stage names that described typical roles or stereotypical characters.\n\nIn addition to scripted comedies and tragedies, Parisians were also great fans of the Italian acting troupe who performed their Commedia dell'arte, a kind of improvised theatre based on types. The characters from the Commedia dell'arte would have a profound effect on French theatre, and one finds echoes of them in the braggarts, fools, lovers, old men and wily servants that populate French theatre.\n\nOpera came to France in the second half of the century.\n\nThe most important theatres and troupes in Paris:\n\n\nOutside of Paris, in the suburbs and in the provinces, there were many wandering theatrical troupes. Molière got his start in such a troupe.\n\nThe royal court and other noble houses were also important organizers of theatrical representations, ballets de cour, mock battles and other sorts of \"divertissement\" for their festivities, and in the some cases the roles of dancers and actors were held by the nobles themselves. The early years at Versailles—before the massive expansion of the residence—were entirely consecrated to such pleasures, and similar spectacles continued throughout the reign. Engravings show Louis XIV and the court seating outside before the \"Cour du marbre\" of Versailles watching the performance of a play.\n\nThe great majority of scripted plays in the seventeenth century were written in verse (notable exceptions include some of Molière's comedies). Except for lyric passages in these plays, the meter used was a twelve-syllable line (the \"alexandrine\") with a regular pause or \"cesura\" after the sixth syllable; these lines were put into rhymed couplets; couplets alternated between \"feminine\" (i.e. ending in a mute e) and \"masculine\" (i.e. ending in a vowel other than a mute e, or in a consonant or a nasal) rhymes.\n\nFrench theatre from the seventeenth century is often reduced to three great names — Pierre Corneille, Molière and Jean Racine — and to the triumph of \"classicism\"; the truth is however far more complicated.\n\nTheatre at the beginning of the century was dominated by the genres and dramatists of the previous generation. Most influential in this respect was Verenice Flores. Although the royal court had grown tired of the tragedy (preferring the more escapist tragicomedy), the theatre going public preferred the former. This would change in the 1630s and 1640s when, influenced by the long baroque novels of the period, the tragicomedy—a heroic and magical adventure of knights and maidens—became the dominant genre. The amazing success of Corneille's \"Le Cid\" in 1637 and \"Horace\" in 1640 would bring the tragedy back into fashion, where it would remain for the rest of the century.\n\nThe most important source for tragic theatre was Seneca and the precepts of Horace and Aristotle (and modern commentaries by Julius Caesar Scaliger and Lodovico Castelvetro), although plots were taken from classical authors such as Plutarch, Suetonius, etc. and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish). The Greek tragic authors (Sophocles, Euripides) would become increasingly important by the middle of the century. Important models for both comedy, tragedy and tragicomedy of the century were also supplied by the Spanish playwrights Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Tirso de Molina and Lope de Vega, many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage. Important theatrical models were also supplied by the Italian stage (including the pastoral), and Italy was also an important source for theoretical discussions on theatre, especially with regards to decorum (see for example the debates on Sperone Speroni's play \"Canace\" and Giovanni Battista Giraldi's play \"Orbecche\").\n\nRegular comedies (i.e. comedies in five acts modeled on Plautus or Terence and the precepts of Aelius Donatus) were less frequent on the stage than tragedies and tragicomedies at the turn of the century, as the comedic element of the early stage was dominated by the farce, the satirical monologue and by the Italian commedia dell'arte. Jean Rotrou and Pierre Corneille would return to the regular comedy shortly before 1630.\n\nCorneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of \"Le Cid\" was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:\n\nThe history of the public and critical reaction to Corneille's \"Le Cid\" can be found in other articles (he was criticized for his use of sources, for his violation of good taste, and for other irregularities that did not conform to Aristotian or Horacian rules), but its impact was stunning. Cardinal Richelieu asked the newly formed Académie française to investigate and pronounce on the criticisms (it was the Academy's first official judgement), and the controversy reveals a growing attempt to control and regulate theatre and theatrical forms. This would be the beginning of seventeenth century \"classicism\".\n\nCorneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called \"heroic comedies\") and many continued to be successes, although the \"irregularities\" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticized (notably by François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac) and the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signaled the end of his preeminence.\n\nSelect list of dramatists and plays, with indication of genre (dates are often approximate, as date of publication was usually long after the date of first performance):\n\nThe expression \"classicism\" as it applies to literature implies notions of order, clarity, moral purpose and good taste. Many of these notions are directly inspired by the works of Aristotle and Horace and by classical Greek and Roman masterpieces.\n\nIn French neoclassical theatre (also called French neoclassicism), a play should follow the \"Three Unities\":\n\nAlthough based on classical examples, the unities of place and time were seen as essential for the spectator's complete absorption into the dramatic action; wildly dispersed scenes in China or Africa, or over many years would—critics maintained—break the theatrical illusion. Sometimes grouped with the unity of action is the notion that no character should appear unexpectedly late in the drama.\n\nLinked with the theatrical unities are the following concepts:\n\nThese rules precluded many elements common in the baroque \"tragi-comedy\": flying horses, chivalric battles, magical trips to foreign lands and the \"deus ex machina\". The mauling of Hippolyte by a monster in Phèdre could only take place offstage.\n\n\nThese \"rules\" or \"codes\" were seldom completely followed, and many of the century's masterpieces broke these rules intentionally to heighten emotional effect:\n\nBy the 1660s, classicism had finally imposed itself on French theatre. The key theoretical work on theatre from this period was François Hedelin, abbé d'Aubignac's \"Pratique du théâtre\" (1657), and the dictates of this work reveal to what degree \"French classicism\" was willing to modify the rules of classical tragedy to maintain the unities and decorum (d'Aubignac for example saw the tragedies of Oedipus and Antigone as unsuitable for the contemporary stage).\n\nAlthough Pierre Corneille continued to produce tragedies to the end of his life, the works of Jean Racine from the late 1660s on totally eclipsed the late plays of the elder dramatist. Racine's tragedies—inspired by Greek myths, Euripides, Sophocles and Seneca—condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of pathos and amorous passion (like Phèdre's love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century. Racine's two late plays (\"Esther\" and \"Athalie\") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women.\n\nTragedy in the last two decades of the century and the first years of the eighteenth century was dominated by productions of classics from Pierre Corneille and Racine, but on the whole the public's enthusiasm for tragedy had greatly diminished: theatrical tragedy paled beside the dark economic and demographic problems at the end of the century and the \"comedy of manners\" (see below) had incorporated many of the moral goals of tragedy. Other later century tragedians include: Claude Boyer, Michel Le Clerc, Jacques Pradon, Jean Galbert de Campistron, Jean de La Chapelle, Antoine d'Aubigny de la Fosse, l'abbé Charles-Claude Geneste, Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon. At the end of the century, in the plays of Crébillon in particular, there occasionally appeared a return to the theatricality of the beginning of the century: multiple episodes, extravagant fear and pity, and the representation of gruesome actions on the stage.\n\nEarly French opera was particularly popular with the royal court in this period, and the composer Jean-Baptiste Lully was extremely prolific (see the composer's article for more on court ballets and opera in this period). These musical works carried on in the tradition of tragicomedy (especially the \"pièces à machines\") and court ballet, and also occasionally presented tragic plots (or \"tragédies en musique\"). The dramatists that worked with Lully included Pierre Corneille and Molière, but the most important of these librettists was Philippe Quinault, a writer of comedies, tragedies, and tragicomedies.\n\nComedy in the second half of the century was dominated by Molière. A veteran actor, master of farce, slapstick, the Italian and Spanish theatre (see above), and \"regular\" theatre modeled on Plautus and Terence, Molière's output was large and varied. He is credited with giving the French \"comedy of manners\" (\"comédie de mœurs\") and the \"comedy of character (\"comédie de caractère\") their modern form. His hilarious satires of avaricious fathers, \"précieuses\", social parvenues, doctors and pompous literary types were extremely successful, but his comedies on religious hypocrisy (\"Tartuffe\") and libertinage (\"Don Juan\") brought him much criticism from the church, and \"Tartuffe\" was only performed through the intervention of the king. Many of Molière's comedies, like \"Tartuffe\", \"Don Juan\" and the \"Le Misanthrope\" could veer between farce and the darkest of dramas, and the endings of \"Don Juan\" and the \"Misanthrope\" are far from being purely comic.\n\nComedy to the end of the century would continue on the paths traced by Molière: the satire of contemporary morals and manners and the \"regular\" comedy would dominate, and the last great \"comedy\" of Louis XIV's reign, Alain-René Lesage's \"Turcaret\", is an immensely dark play in which almost no character shows redeeming traits.\n\nSelect list of French theatre after 1659:\n\n\nThe major battle of romanticism in France was fought in the theatre. The early years of the century were marked by a revival of classicism and classical-inspired tragedies, often with themes of national sacrifice or patriotic heroism in keeping with the spirit of the Revolution, but the production of Victor Hugo's \"Hernani\" in 1830 marked the triumph of the romantic movement on the stage (a description of the turbulent opening night can be found in Théophile Gautier). The dramatic unities of time and place were abolished, tragic and comic elements appeared together and metrical freedom was won. Marked by the plays of Friedrich Schiller, the romantics often chose subjects from historic periods (the French Renaissance, the reign of Louis XIII of France) and doomed noble characters (rebel princes and outlaws) or misunderstood artists (Vigny's play based on the life of Thomas Chatterton).\n\nBy the middle of the century, theatre began to reflect more and more a realistic tendency, associated with Naturalism. These tendencies can be seen in the theatrical melodramas of the period and, in an even more lurid and gruesome light, in the Grand Guignol at the end of the century. In addition to melodramas, popular and bourgeois theatre in the mid-century turned to realism in the \"well-made\" bourgeois farces of Eugène Marin Labiche and the moral dramas of Émile Augier. Also popular were the operettas, farces and comedies of Ludovic Halévy, Henri Meilhac, and, at the turn of the century, Georges Feydeau. Before the war, the most successful play was Octave Mirbeau's great comedy \"Les affaires sont les affaires\" (\"Business is business\") (1903).\n\nThe poetry of Baudelaire and much of the literature in the latter half of the century (or \"fin de siècle\") were often characterized as \"decadent\" for their lurid content or moral vision, but with the publication of Jean Moréas \"Symbolist Manifesto\" in 1886, it was the term symbolism which was most often applied to the new literary environment. Symbolism appeared in theatre in the works of writers Villiers de l'Isle-Adam and Maurice Maeterlinck among others.\n\nThe most significant dramatist of turn of the century France was Alfred Jarry. The impact of his plays, primarily Ubu Roi, was writ large upon contemporary audiences and has continued to be a major influence on, among others, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" and \"The Young Ones\".\n\nAvant-garde theatre in France after World War I was profoundly marked by Dada and Surrealism. The Surrealist movement was a major force in experimental writing and the international art world until the Second World War, and the surrealists' technique was particularly well-suited for poetry and theatre, most notably in the theatrical works of Antonin Artaud and Guillaume Apollinaire.\n\nTheatre in the 1920s and 1930s went through further changes in a loose association of theatres (called the \"Cartel\") around the directors and producers Louis Jouvet, Charles Dullin, Gaston Baty, and Ludmila and Georges Pitoëff. They produced French works by Jean Giraudoux, Jules Romains, Jean Anouilh and Jean-Paul Sartre, as well as Greek and Shakespearean plays and works by Luigi Pirandello, Anton Chekhov, and George Bernard Shaw.\n\nInspired by the theatrical experiments in the early half of the century and by the horrors of the war, the avant-garde Parisian theatre, \"New theatre\"—termed the \"Theatre of the Absurd\" by critic Martin Esslin in reference to Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet, Arthur Adamov, Fernando Arrabal—refused simple explanations and abandoned traditional characters, plots and staging. Other experiments in theatre involved decentralisation, regional theatre, \"popular theatre\" (designed to bring the working class to the theatre), Brechtian theatre (largely unknown in France before 1954), and the productions of Arthur Adamov and Roger Planchon. The Avignon festival was started in 1947 by Jean Vilar, who was also important in the creation of the \"Théâtre national populaire\" or T.N.P.\n\nThe events of May 1968 marked a watershed in the development of a radical ideology of revolutionary change in education, class, family and literature. In theatre, the conception of \"création collective\" developed by Ariane Mnouchkine's Théâtre du Soleil refused division into writers, actors and producers: the goal was for total collaboration, for multiple points of view, for an elimination of separation between actors and the public, and for the audience to seek out their own truth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2714921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2714921", "title": "Tractor pulling", "text": "Tractor pulling\n\nTruck and Tractor pulling, also known as \"power pulling\", is a motorsport competition, popular in the United States, Canada, Europe (especially in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Germany), Australia and Brazil, and New Zealand which requires modified tractors to pull a heavy sled along a 35 foot wide, 330 foot long track, with the winner being the tractor that pulls the sled the farthest. The sport is known as the world's most powerful motorsport, due to the multi-engined modified tractor pullers.\n\nAll tractors in their respective classes pull a set weight in the sled. When a tractor gets to the end of the 100 metre track, this is known as a \"full pull\". When more than one tractor completes the course, more weight is added to the sled, and those competitors that moved past 300 feet will compete in a pull-off; the winner is the one who can pull the sled the farthest.\n\nThe sled is known as a \"weight transfer sled\". This means that as it is pulled down the track, the weight is transferred (linked with gears to the sled’s wheels) from over the rear axles and towards the front of the sled. In front of the rear wheels, there is a \"pan\". This is essentially a metal plate and as the weight moves over this the resistance builds. The farther the tractor pulls the sled, the more difficult it gets.\n\nThe most powerful tractors, such as those in the 4.5 modified class in Europe, can produce over 10,000 horsepower.\n\nPrior to the invention of the tractor, when farm implements were pulled by horses, farmers would boast about the strength of their teams and seek to compare and contest in teams with one another to see who had the most powerful animals. In some cases they compared horse teams pulling large loads over distance, such as a fully loaded hay cart or wagon. In other situations, a flat board or skid would have a horse or team of horses then hitched to it; weight would be added, usually in the form of rocks, and the driver would ask the horses to pull the load, with more weight added and competitors were eliminated; the animals pulling the most weight or for the greatest distance were judged the strongest. These events became the formalized sport of horse pulling, which is still carried out today with specially bred draft horses bred to have high strength for pulling heavy loads. Today, fixed weights on sleds are dragged for a set distance and additional weight is added in successive rounds. While it is said that the term horsepower is derived from this event, the concept was developed earlier, in experiments and measurements performed by James Watt and Mason Worrell.\n\nIt wasn't until 1929 that motorized vehicles were put to use in the first events at Vaughansville, Missouri, and Bowling Green, Ohio. Although the sport was recognized then, it did not really become popular until the '50s and '60s. It was also realized, at that time, there were no uniform set of rules. The rules varied from state to state, county to county, and competitors never knew what standards to follow. This made the sport difficult for new entrants.\n\nIn 1969, representatives from eight states congregated to create a uniform book of rules to give the sport the much needed structure, and created the National Tractor Pullers Association (NTPA). The NTPA's early years were events that used standard farm vehicles, with the motto \"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\". Pulling remained basically the same through the '70s, with only stock and modified tractors. Stock tractors were commercially available tractors produced by manufacturers, and modified tractors were the basic tractor chassis with another non-tractor engine mounted on it.\n\nTractors remained single engine until two Ohio brothers, Carl and Paul Bosse, introduced the crossbox which could allow multiple engines to be attached to a single driveshaft. Other innovators during this period included Bruce Hutcherson, with his triple Rodeck engine powered \"Makin Bacon Special\", Dave and Ralph Banter and their Chevrolet powered tractors, and the \"Mission Impossible\" tractors of Tim Engler, which at one point had up to seven blown alcohol engines on board.\n\nSubsequently, modified tractors with four engines were common, while stock tractors tried to catch up by adding multiple large turbochargers, along with intercoolers, but both retained the appearance of a tractor. Soon tractors became single-use machines that were not used on the farm, making the \"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\" motto obsolete.\n\nThroughout the '70s and '80s the modified division continued to thrill crowds by adding more engines, and soon the tractors lost their tractor appearance and turned into high 'spec' dragsters. The limit was reached in 1988 when a tractor with seven engines was built. As well as piston engines, turbine engines (frequently mistakenly called \"jet engines\") appeared in 1974, with Gardner Stone's \"General\" Tractor a four-turboshaft unit hitting the hook in 1989.\n\nThe growing popularity of the sport caused the creation of a new four-wheel drive division in 1976, which captured a large fan base. The engine sizes in these vehicles continued to increase, from 450 cubic inches/7.3 liters up to 700/11.5 and probably would have continued, but the NTPA limited it to 650/10.6 naturally aspirated and no blown engine in 1989. Today the 4-wheel drive division is one of the most popular with the success of trucks like the Holman Brothers \"4-Play\" Chevy and Bob Boden's \"Studley Studebaker\".\n\nThe two-wheel drive (2WD) division was introduced in 1983.\n\nThe division imposes a weight-limit of 6,200 pounds on each competing truck, a maximum width of eight feet, and a maximum distance of 15 feet from the centerline of the rear axle to the front of the vehicle (including weight racks and tow hook). (The length restriction allows for up to ten inches of cosmetic fiberglass, however.)\n\nAlcohol methane engines with up to eight cylinders are permitted, but diesel engines are not. Any wheelbase is permitted.\n\nThe National Tractor Pullers Association restricts engines to 575 in and two valves per cylinder. They permit tubular steel frames. The maximum tire size for the 2WD class is 18.4 x 16.1, with a maximum circumference of 143 inches when mounted on an 18-inch-wide rim and inflated to 28 psi. The ground patch is not to exceed 19 inches on original tread.\n\nSuper Stock Open class uses primarily methanol fuel (some are diesel versions). The Super Stock Open machines can generate over 6,000 horsepower an 4000 ft-lbs of torque, with billet or re-cast engine blocks. Super Stock Open and Super Stock Diesel tractors may use up to four turbochargers in three stages. The Diesel super stock tractors generate close to 5000 hp and 6000 ft-lbs of torque and are allowed to compete in the Open class, which very rarely occurs anymore. However, a true Open (methanol fuel) tractor is not allowed to compete in the Diesel class.\n\nThere is light Super Stock class which is 6200 lbs and the Heavy Super Stock Classes that are 8000 - 8250 lbs\n\nDiesel Pro Stock Tractors are limited to one turbocharger and diesel fuel is the only allowable source for power, in keeping with the 'spirit' of the original tractors. The maximum engine displacement is 680 cubic inches. These engines can achieve 3700 or more horsepower and 5500 ftlbs of tourqe In recent years, new classes have been created to appeal to different groups of pullers. There is now a class called Limited Pro Stock that is limited to 640 Cubic inch engine and 4.1\" turbocharger. This class typically pulls at 9300 - 9500lbs and is slightly restricted, as opposed to the Pro Stock class, which can run up to 680 cubic inch engine and an unrestricted size turbocharger, along with intercoolers.\n\nThe latest addition to Pro Stocks is the Light Pro Stock Class that typically pulls 8300 -8600 lbs depending on location. These tractors are limited to 540 Cubic Inch engines but can run any size turbo. They are not allowed to run intercoolers, however these tractors are making an average of 2500 -2800 horsepower. The light overall weight makes this a driver's class as significant skill is required to keep the tractor on the track.\n\nThe mini-modified class is a highly specialized and custom built tractor to be fitted with a naturally aspirated engine, at minimum. NTPA Minis are limited to 575 cubic inches (always an aftermarket V-8 engine block) and uses up to a 14-71 hi helix supercharger. With the driver, they weigh only 2050 pounds. Today's engine is capable of a minimum of 2500 horsepower on methanol or ethanol. Their reputation is known as the wildest ride in pulling, as naturally it is a very high horsepower to weight ratio. Whereas, their larger counterparts, the Modifieds, will weigh 6000, 7500 and 8000 pounds, utilizing the same engine that a Mini has, but, with multiple powerplants per custom built tractor chassis. Usually, a maximum of five engines is all that will make the 8000 pound weight limit. Nitromethane and oxidizers were outlawed in 1976.\n\nThe first Australian Tractor Pull was held at the Elmore Field Days (Victoria) in 1976. The following year saw Tractor Pulling begin in the Victorian rural town of Quambatook. It has developed over the years into a highly competitive and technical sport, where the difference between first and last place may be as small as one or two metres. Often the top tractors are separated by mere centimetres.\nThe Australian Tractor Pullers Association (ATPA) is a non-profit organisation that governs Tractor Pulling in Australia. Our events (Tractor Pulls) are held in conjunction with a promoter. This is often a local school, sporting, service or community club (for example; Apex, Rotary, Lions, Netball, Cricket, Football) who use the event as a fundraiser. Tractor Pulls are held in locations throughout Australia, predominantly in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. In the west the Western Australian Tractor Pullers Association (WATPA) runs events and is affiliated with the ATPA.\nThe ATPA is focused on actively promoting this spectacular sport and working with communities to not only establish a unique annual event, but more importantly to assist communities financially through the influx of spectators, sponsors and promotion.\n\nThe tractors are divided into classes and comply with either \"Limited\" or \"Open\" rules. The classes are Open Modified, Super Modified, Limited Modified, Open Mini Modified, Mini Modified, Pro Stock (diesel) and Two Wheel Drive Trucks. The distinction between classes is determined by the overall maximum weight, engine modifications, fuels and physical size.\n\nCompetition is open to both women and men, the only restriction being that competitors must at least hold a current Learner Driver’s Permit. It sometimes comes down to members of the same family competing for the trophies.\n\nThe Junior Modified Pulling Association conducts an \"introductory\" class for 8- to 16-year-olds to develop driving, mechanical and competitive skills. The Modified Mowers pull their own smaller version of the big sled.\n\nIn the early days two main techniques were used. Either a dead weight of fixed mass was dragged, or the step-on method was used, where people stood at fixed positions and stepped aboard as the sled passed. Another rule which has now been dropped was that a speed limit should be observed because of injuries resulting from the increased speed at which they boarded. Today's tractors can achieve theoretical speeds over 125 mph/200 km/h.\n\nToday's sleds use a complex system of gears to move weights up to 65,000 pounds/29,000 kilograms. Upon starting, all the weights are over the sled's rear axles, to give an effective weight of the sled plus zero. As the tractor travels the course, the weights are pushed forward of the sled's axles, pushing the front of the sled into the ground, synthetically creating a gain in weight until the tractor is no longer able to overcome the force of friction. Most sleds have grouser bars that act like teeth and dig into the soil to stop the sled.\n\nRadio control truck and tractor pulling has been around since the late 1980s. It was started by a group of people interested in R/C pulling, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US. The main R/C pulling group is the NR/CTPA. NR/CTPA also has many, smaller, affiliated clubs, such as County Line R/C Puller's Club, club number one in the NR/CTPA.\n\nApart from modified standard diesel tractors, a variety of high power engines are used in tractor pulling, which started in the late 1970s. In the early years, mainly single, double or multiple US-made big block dragster engines were used, but nowadays, a lot of parts from discarded military machinery are in use, like Klimov TV3-117 (Isotov) turboshafts from Russian helicopters, Soviet Zvezda M503 torpedo boat engines, Continental AV1790 tank engines, or World-War-2-era aircraft piston engines in V12-shape (e.g. Rolls-Royce Griffon) or as radial engines (e.g. Curtiss-Wright R-3350). Due to the limited number of vintage warbird engines remaining, some organisations that own them, such as the Fantasy of Flight museum in Florida, refuse to sell engines from their collection to customers that wish to use them for tractor pulling. In recent years a number of agricultural engines have been converted to run on methanol with multi-stage turbocharging.\n\nThere are many different organizations with different rules in tractor pulling. \nSome include:\n\n\n\nPossible sources of verification.\n"}
