During a fourteen-year tenure as manager of London's Palace Theatre, beginning in 1904, Butt built a theatre empire, expanding firstly with the Alhambra Theatre, Glasgow in 1910, followed by the London Victoria Palace a year later, to rival that of Edward Moss and others. He became managing director of several London West End theatres beginning in 1914, including the Adelphi Theatre, the Empire Theatre, the Gaiety Theatre and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, as well as theatres outside London. He continued as a theatre impresario until 1931.\n\nDuring the First World War, also, Butt became Director of Food Rationing at the Ministry of Food. He was knighted for his services to the ministry, and for his work for war charities, in 1918. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Balham and Tooting in 1922. In 1929, he was created a baronet \"of Westminster in the County of London\" for his services to political and public life. He was forced to resign from the Commons in June 1936 over a financial scandal. After this, Butt concentrated on horse racing.\n\nAlfred Butt was born in London, the son of solicitor Alfred Beyfus whose forebears had migrated from Hamburg to Glasgow and London, and educated at Emanuel School before entering employment in the counting-house of Harrod's department store where his uncle, Edgar Cohen, through the Beyfus family was a director. He subsequently joined the Palace Theatre, a music hall in Cambridge Circus, London, largely controlled by the Beyfus family and associates. He became company secretary of the Palace Theatre Limited in 1898, at the young age of 19. He quickly advanced to the position of assistant manager, and when Charles Morton died in 1904, he became manager of the Palace. In 1906 he became managing director, a position he held for 14 years.\n\nHe developed close links with the Orpheum Vaudeville Circuit and its associates in the United States, and brought numerous American stars to London. He also introduced British audiences to continental performers such as Anna Pavlova and Yvette Guilbert. In 1910 he greatly expanded his theatre business when he took control of Thomas Barrasford's music halls and formed a joint company, the \"Variety Theatres Controlling Company Limited\", with Walter de Frece. VTCC became the second largest chain of music halls in the United Kingdom, second only to Moss Empires. Among their London theatres managed by Butt were the Globe and Queen's Theatres.\n\nOutside London Butt opened two new theatres, firstly, the Alhambra Theatre, Glasgow, in 1910, designed by Sir John James Burnet and, secondly, the Theatre Mogador, Paris in 1919 (delayed by the First World War), designed by Bertie Crewe. Butt became managing director of three West End theatres during the war: the Adelphi Theatre (1915–19), the Empire Theatre (1914–28) and the Gaiety Theatre (1915–19). He became joint owner and managing director of London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane from 1925-31.\n\nAlso during the First World War, he was appointed in 1917 by the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George, on the recommendation of Lord Northcote, as the Director of Food Rationing and introduced compulsory food rationing with the support of his principal civil servant William Beveridge. He was knighted for his services to the Ministry, and for his work for war charities, in 1918.\n\nButt was a supporter of the Conservative & Unionist Party. After standing unsuccessfully for the party at parliamentary elections at Walworth and Paddington North, he was elected as member of parliament for Balham and Tooting at the 1922 general election. In 1929 he was created a baronet \"of Westminster in the County of London\" for his services to political and public life. He held the seat at successive elections until he was forced to resign from the Commons in June 1936 over a scandal concerning a leak of budget details from which he was believed to have benefitted financially.\n\nWith the end of his political career, Butt concentrated on his interest in the horse-racing industry. He purchased the Brook Stud near Newmarket. His two most successful horses were \"Steady Aim\", winner of The Oaks, and \"Petition\", winner of the Ascot New Stakes, both in 1946.\n\nHe was married twice. The first marriage in 1908 was to Georgina Mary Say, who died in 1960. His second marriage was to Wilhelmine Wahl later in 1960. He had one son, Kenneth Dudley Butt, from his first marriage.\n\nSir Alfred Butt died at his Newmarket home in December 1962, aged 84. He was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium.\n"}
{"id": "8000467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8000467", "title": "Alpha Waves", "text": "Alpha Waves\n\nAlpha Waves is a 1990 3D game that combines labyrinthine exploration with platform gameplay. It combined for the first time full-screen, six-axis, flat-shaded 3D with 3D object interaction (like bouncing on a platform). Alpha Waves was an abstract game with a moody, artistic presentation, named for its supposed ability to stimulate the different emotional centers of the brain with its use of color and music.\n\nIt was developed initially for the Atari ST by Christophe de Dinechin, and later ported to the Amiga and DOS. The DOS port was done by Frédérick Raynal, a notable game designer who would go on to develop \"Alone in the Dark\" (often abbreviated AitD), and \"Little Big Adventure\". He has said that his work on \"Alpha Waves\" was a major inspiration for the 3D engine for \"Alone in the Dark\". The PC version was also localized in North America by Data East, and retitled Continuum. Infogrames may have also published their own version in the US under the original title, and it was also released as a part of no less than two Infogrames compilations, on which it retained its original name.\n\nIn 2009, Christophe de Dinechin released the complete assembly language and GFA BASIC source code for the Atari ST version. There is also a started PC port in C++ on sourceforge by the original author.\n\n\"Alpha Waves\" features two main modes of play: Action and Emotion. The core gameplay in both is the same.\n\nPlayers guide one of six crafts (which are little more than geometric shapes in many cases) onto trampoline-like platforms. On these platforms, the player bounces automatically, higher, with each jump, until he reaches the maximum height possible for that platform (some are stronger than others). Every room in the game is a cube, and the walls contain doorways leading to other rooms. In this way, players have to work their way through the game's rooms, and reach different areas based on different emotions.\n\nIn Action Mode, players also work against the clock. Time bonuses are awarded for entering new rooms, and keys can be collected to open new paths. There is not a particular end to the game, but the goal is simply to last as long and to discover as much as possible before time runs out. Emotion Mode allows players to explore without time constraints, but players are not allowed to cross certain game boundaries.\n\nEmotion mode was not time limited, and allowed players to explore the game environment freely. While completing the game in Action Mode was very difficult, many players simply enjoyed exploring the game territory in Emotion Mode.\n\n\"Alpha Waves\" was initially released on the Atari ST. This version is notable for allowing two players to compete simultaneously. It lacked music entirely on the Atari 520ST, because of insufficient memory to store the music samples. On Atari 1040ST and later models, the theme song played during the intro. The music was stored on the second side of the floppy disk, since any Atari ST with enough memory also had a dual-sided floppy drive. A promotional version of the program was distributed by a French magazine on single-sided floppy disks, crashing any machine with more than 512K of memory.\n\nThe Amiga port was second and added a theme song at the title screen. The interface is similar, but the zone select in Emotion has been redone. Beyond this, it is very similar to the original - including the retention of the split-screen two player mode.\n\nThe MS-DOS version was the last one, and contains a number of improvements. This version supported AdLib/SoundBlaster sound cards. Despite the fact that these used the more limited FM synthesis of the Yamaha YM3812, compared to the PCM synthesis of the Amiga, \"Alpha Waves\" is one of the rare exceptions where the AdLib sound quality is superior. The soundtrack was also expanded to play in-game, and each zone had its own music. Additionally some of the mobiles have been changed, level layouts tweaked, and the camera tilting toned down for easier viewing. The menus and level selection screen have been redone again, and are noticeably enhanced. The DOS version also includes a two player Action Mode (turn-based as opposed to the split-screen of the other two versions).\n\nThe DOS version lacks a mechanism to regulate speed when played on systems faster than it was intended for (essentially causing it to play in fast forward on newer hardware). However, when played on a properly configured system or emulator, this can be considered the superior version, for solo play especially.\n\nOther 3D games of the same era include Elite (1984), Falcon (1987), Driller (1987), Starglider 2 (1988), and Hovertank 3D (1991). Alpha-Waves (1990) brought a number of innovations to the 3D gaming experience that make it a significant landmark in 3D gaming:\n\n\"Alpha Waves\" ran on 16-bit microcomputers that did not have hardware floating-point capabilities. For that reason, it performed all perspective and rotation computations using only integer arithmetics. In order to avoid using integer multiplications, which were expensive at the time, it described objects using displacements that were multiples of a base vector. For instance, a square in the Z plane would have been described as \"+1X +1Y -1X -1Y\". As a result, the vast majority of geometric computations were performed using only additions, not multiplications.\n\nThe computation of sine and cosines was similarly done using only integer arithmetic. All angles were represented using not degrees, but 1/256th of a circle. A lookup table contained the value of the sine multiplied by 32767. Multiplying this value by a 16-bit coordinate gave a 32-bit value, and the 16-bit high-half of that result was used.\n\nAnother key to performance was a highly optimized polygon-filling routine, which used a number of tricks, including an assembly version of Duff's device to achieve a high fill rate, besting the in-house self-modifying routine Infogrames was using at the time.\n\nThe Atari ST and Amiga versions were written in assembly language. The DOS version was written in C.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" stated that the game \"plays like one would expect a \"\" \"holodeck\" game to play\". The magazine said that it offered \"some fascinating game experiences\", but the lack of combat or two-player modem racing—and goals so uninteresting that they \"actually \"detract\" from the game\"—caused it to \"fall short in the most important department of lasting entertainment\".\n\n"}

Kenji and his partner Luka arm themselves on a power boat and prepare to rescue Kim and save the world.\n\nThe player controls the boat's steering by Kenji and shooting a rapid-fire bazooka by Luka. The gameplay consists of moving around the map (typically, an archipelago), completing objectives and shooting enemies who stand in the way. The player instantly loses a life if hit, so maneuvering to dodge enemy fire and other obstacles is a critical skill to learn. Typical objectives include reaching and destroying certain structures on the islands or following something around the map to their destination. New objectives are received in the form of radio messages notified of by a specific sound effect.\n\nIn the pause menu, the player can see the last radio message and the map of the area with current targets marked on it.\n\nBimini Run at GameFAQs\n"}
{"id": "39946972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39946972", "title": "Budgie Toys", "text": "Budgie Toys\n\nMorestone, which later changed its name to the more well-known Budgie Toys, was an English diecast toy distributor and then manufacturer based in London. The company first specialised in horse-drawn carriages and coaches. It later made a wide variety of miniature cars and trucks. Vehicles were about Matchbox size, though a bit smaller and a bit cruder. Some models marketed as Morestone were made by a separate company called Modern Products.\n\nMorestone got its name as a contraction of \"Morris\" and \"Stone\" who started distributing the toys in the 1940s. Vehicles were somewhat similar to Dinky Toys in concept, but other toys were also marketed, like a \"dulcimer\" xylophone and a toy drum (Johnson 1998: pp. 178–179). Some vehicles, like the mechanical road sweeper were equipped with clockwork motors. Often Morestone vehicles were made by the company Modern Products, thus \"A Modern Product\" or simply \"Modern\" would be stated on the boxes, and some models were marketed as 'A Modern Product' without any reference to Morestone. Some boxes say, \"Modern\" within a diamond-shaped logo (Nigel 2013). Models later in the 1950s were apparently made by Morestone as the Modern Product label was dropped, usually replaced by \"Morestone Series\". Morestone Series vehicles were varied, but commonly featured AA and RAC Land Rovers and motorcycles with sidecars. Later, reissues of Morestone Series vehicles were made in white metal by 'Zebra Toys'. Another company, Autocraft / DGM acquired many of the dies for early Morestone Series models and reintroduced various motorcycles.\n\nEarlier models said \"Morris & Stone\" on the boxes, but the name was late. contracted Models were also marketed as promotionals for ESSO (First Gear, no date). The Budgie name, was introduced in 1959 and was more like other British toys named after dogs and other animals (Husky and Corgi, etc.).\n\nThe company was acquired by S. Guiterman in 1961, but went out of business in 1966 (Nigel 2013). After this, Modern Products kept making some of the Budgie models until 1969 (First Gear, no date; Ragan 2000, p. 27). Also after 1966, the H. Seener Ltd. company continued to produce slightly altered Budgie models which appeared under the \"Seerol\" name until the late 1990s (First Gear, no date). Modern Products, H. Seener, and Seerol produced models through the 1990s mainly for the London tourist market (First Gear, no date). Another company that took over dies from Modern Products was Starcourt, so it took a while for Budgie Model production to truly cease. In 2017 the original dies for the matchbox size VW beetle and Microbus reappeared under new ownership and are being offered online by the creator of DG copy models, Dave Gilbert under the budgie models website.\n\nEarly Morestone Modern Product toys were a variety of agricultural, truck and automotive vehicles. Often horse-drawn vehicles were common - in particular a couple of stagecoaches. One of these was a more European squarish style \"Ye Olde Coach & Four\", the four being four horses (usually two brown and two gray) with driver and trunk. Also in a more European style was the more ornate single horse \"Gypsy Caravan\". One variation had a yellow body with red details and a green roof. Diecast metal wheels were often painted gold. Another American style \"Stage Coach\" came with either two or four horses. The coach, rigging, chest, horses and driver were all made of zamac. This more-rounded coach came in \"Wild West\", \"Wells Fargo\", or \"Kansas to Texas\" (return from the cattle drive?) styles. With four horses these coaches were about long.\n\nA similar vehicle also was the four-horse, American-style covered wagon, available with material canopy and side water barrels. The canopy (\"hood\") was sometimes plain and sometimes imprinted with cowboy and Native American design. Over the years, boxes also came in a variety of colors. Later offerings of this covered wagon were \"Hawkeye, the Last of the Mohicans\", and \"Walt Disney's Davey Crockett\". This wagon normally appeared with four detachable horses, but at times came with six. Another smaller covered wagon was also offered (Rixon 2005, p. 68).\n\nOther horse-drawn vehicles were a single-horse wheeled \"Sam's\" coffee stall, a horse-drawn snack bar, a single-occupant horse-drawn Hansom Cab, and Santa's sleigh with single reindeer (Rixon 2005, p. 106). Additionally available was a smaller State Landau elaborate coach with six horses, but the finish was a bit cruder, and the horses were not detachable.\n\nMorestone cars in the 1950s were painted a variety of non-metallic colors, and often were two toned paint. Their wheels were most often plain silver metal. 1960s Budgie cars and trucks were reminiscent of Matchbox, though slightly smaller, with less detail, and simpler with plain paint and no windows (Ragan 2000, p. 27-28). It seems the detail increasingly required to satisfy Matchbox and Hot Wheels' toy-hungry children was something Budgie had problems keeping up with. The Morestone, Modern Product and ESSO series toys were a smaller scale and were the more common; some trucks and motorcycles were a bit larger scale, somewhat like Corgi Toys or Dinkys.\n\nDespite the simplicity, some models and their liveries could be quite clever, and Morestone/Budgie's forte seemed to be in selecting unique subjects not manufactured by other companies (Rixon 2005, p. 38). Distinct cars and smaller vehicles were wheeled air compressors, a tandem bicycle with two metal 'riders' and sidecar, a 1953 Packard Clipper convertible, a 1957 Plymouth Belvedere convertible, and a 1967 Oldsmobile 98 'town sedan' (Ragan 2000, pp. 46, 79-80). In trucks and construction, notable were the Morris \"Budgie Service\" breakdown lorry, the ERF low loader with electrical cable spools on the trailer, the strangely shaped ERF-articulated, mobile traffic \"Jumbo\" control unit, the Leyland tanker truck labeled with the phrase \"You'll feel a lot better if you drink milk\", or the R.E.A. Express Commer van with appropriate budgerigar illustrated on the van's sides (Ragan 2000, p. 71; Rixon 2005, p. 114, 143). One intriguing model was the Thornycroft Amazon salvage lorry with crane which raises and swivels - the model also features a separate auxiliary engine (Rixon 2005, p. 39). Another would be the early-1960s GMC delivery van with Hertz markings or the \nBedford tipper truck with \"Ham River Grit\" written on the sides (Rixon 2005, p. 6).\n\nOne assembly detail different on Morestone/Budgie models, compared to other manufacturers, is the painting of wheels \"after\" they have been attached to axles. The appearance of painted 'hubs' at times makes a buyer wonder if the model has been 'retouched' by a collector, but this is factory spec (Ragan 2000, p. 27; Rixon 2005, p. 39).\n\nBefore and after the Budgie name was introduced, the company also offered a line of Enid Blyton's 'Noddy' character figurines and vehicles. This included metal characters with wagons and bicycles of the wooden boy Noddy and his brownie friend, Big Ears.\n\nEarly packaging for stagecoaches, etc. would be marked \"Morestone\" and \"Modern Products\". Boxes were two parts; lid and bottom with staples closing the lid on each end. The lid was covered with a printed, rather monocolor, paper label.\n\nLater, yellow and red boxes with white trim seem to have been \"Modern\" Products offerings only without any reference to Morestone or Budgie (which name was introduced in 1959). Whichever package was seen, the vehicles themselves often only said, \"Made in England\" along with their names and number on the metal bases – but no indication of manufacturer – making their manufacturer difficult to identify at times (Rixon 2005, p. 39). Morestone/Budgie models are thus often mistaken for Matchbox toys. The goal may have been to make vehicles generically labeled for easier marketing under several different names: \"Modern\", \"Morestone\" or \"ESSO\".\n\nAs mentioned, ESSO petrol was a main sponsor and its distinctive oval sign appears on many Morestone models. ESSO-themed packaging was a main theme of the mid-1950s models and the boxes portrayed the name in 'portrait' style with box standing on end. Morestone's ESSO packaging is reminiscent of other companies that attempted to claim a market niche with unique box styles. Whereas Matchbox had 'Match'-boxes, Aurora had 'Cigar'-boxes, Charbens had little suitcases and Benbros had boxes that looked like TV sets, Morestone's ESSO line packaged vehicles in little boxes that looked like gas pumps (Rixon 2005, p. 39). One side of the box looked like (with end flap open) the face of an 'ESSO-Extra' petrol pump with a gallons gauge, while opposite sides illustrated the toy. The box front states \"ESSO Petrol Pump Series manufactured and produced by Morris & Stone (London) Ltd. by permission of the owners of the ESSO trademark\" (Rixon 2005, p. 39). Stores were supplied with colorful ESSO display stands which held the 20 Morestone vehicles in the series. Buyers could get a free 'garage' by sending in coupons off of the boxes (which most certainly hinders the search for non-cut, perfectly boxed models).\n\nPackaging c. 1960, after the Budgie name was introduced, consisted of pale yellow boxes with black flaps. Later, hanging blister packs were a pale-turquoise with a bright-orange stripe across the top. \"Budgie\" was written in bold white letters in the orange area with a budgerigar bird illustrated to the right. Selected models are listed on the back of the package. Other blister cards were yellow with black highlighting or red, white, and blue. Gift sets had pictures of young boys with the cars. Some Budgie blister cards were sponsored by \"Life\" magazine and distributed through The Toy House. The packaging for these had more of a blue-and-white colored card with red lettering. The card carried both the logo for The Toy House and said, \"Advertised in LIFE magazine\".\n\nSome later Budgie Toys made their way into the New Zealand Fun Ho! Toys Midget Car series along with many Matchbox toolings. The kiwi Midget Toys boxes took their design from the earlier Budgie / Modern Products boxes and their red and yellow colored panels.\n\n"}

It was very important for us to recognize and acknowledge the countercultures that exist around us; these are the people who give our identity depth. \"Coke Studio\" has the reach to allow us to get to know these cultures more intimately and to amplify their colors.\" It was not until March 8, 2018 when the duo were announced as a new producers for the series and as a part of new module, \"Coke Studio Explorer\" was revealed at the end of June 2018; in an interview Hamza said, \"we wanted to focus on things that we hadn't ever explored before, and to look at elements of what makes Pakistan what it is today-highlighting the Pakistani identity and truly owning the white in our flag.\" On the idea of series Kazi said, \"the thing that was established in the first ten minutes was how we were going to end this because once you establish the end, automatically your goals are established and a plan emerges.\" \n\nOn explaining the creation behind \"Coke Studio Explorer\" Zohaib said, \"we felt that CS had to spread its wings and throw a larger net across the country, to not just attract the urban pool, but the rural pool as well. At the end of the day, the regions and its people collectively make Pakistan. It was important for us to explore this vision in depth.\" Adding to the new format of the show Hamza said, \"we've learned a lot from both the producer's (Rohail Hyatt, Strings) tenures. Both had their positives, but by the end, we know there’s always going to be margin for more. We didn’t look at it as individuals, but across 10 years of CS rather than the journey of Rohail Hayat or Strings. We were very clear that we weren't going to put our journeys into it either, but focus objectively on the platform after this decade.\" Kazi also chipped, \"after ten years, we felt that \"Coke Studio\" needed to innovate and search for talent wider and deeper than it had in the past. As producers, that is what we tried to do with \"Coke Studio Explorer\". More importantly, we tried to construct a module that will bring people together. We are in an election year and the political climate of the country is both charged and polarised. We hope that \"Coke Studio Explorer\" will help add some love and amity to the atmosphere and bring people together, using the tremendous power of music.\"\n\nThe General Manager of \"Coca-Cola\" Pakistan and Afghanistan, Rizwan U. Khan explained, \"\"Coke Studio Explorer\" is an unique manner of exploring the vast talent of our country. In addition \"Coke Studio\" has a legacy which has embraced and promoted Pakistan’s rich, vibrant and diverse culture. That has helped shaped a new narrative within and externally.\" He further stated that \"\"Coke Studio Explorer\" has been created as a natural and progressive chapter to the continuing legacy of \"Coke Studio\".\n\nThe duo travelled extensively in the norther region of Pakistan, Sindh and Punjab to discover the regional but relatively unknown artists of their respective regions. In an interview duo said, \"we established the criteria for selection before embarking on our search for musicians. The musicians had to be relatively unknown. They had to represent a unique aspect of the culture, history and spirit of Pakistan. And, they had to be talented. The selections were made in the field-in a natural, freewheeling and largely unrestrained manner – using the criteria that had been established in the beginning.\" According to Kazi search for such artists was \"both extensive and expansive\" and together they covered four provinces of Pakistan bringing five artists to the platform. The duo developed a special mobile recording system for the on-location recordings and while additional tracks and engineering was completed in studio.\n\nThe Explorer series featured five set of musicians from five regions of Pakistan, all of whom were unknown but popular in their native regions. In Bumburet Valley of Kalash the duo collaborated with Ariana (Farsi Gul) and Amrina, explaining about their collaboration Kazi said, \"it's not every day that you come across two girls whose vocals scale as high as the cultural peaks of the Kalash Valleys. Ariana and Amrina are true personification of this traditional musical journey. They may be 4,000 but there chants make them sound like Four Hundred Thousand!\". in Deewan Lal Chand village of Sindh, the brother-sister Vishnu and Shamu Bai famous for their bhajans were made part of, while in Sohbatpur District, throat-singers Mangal, Darehan and Shayan (now Bloach Throat singers) known for their singing technique \"Naur-Sur\" made their debuts, and from Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir a band of four musicians titled, Qasamir lead by Altaf Mir with Ghulam Mohammad Daar, Manzoor Ahmed Khan, Saifuddin Shah performed. The duo wanted to record the song in the mountains of Muzaffarabad but because of the rain they had to shot indoor and then they recorded the video out side later. They couldn't wait for the rain as both \"Explorer\" and season eleven were shot back-to-back at Coke Studio production house in Karachi. The fifth and final artist Mishal Khawaja a Pakistani born-Canadian singer was discovered through her Instagram covers by Kazi. The duso said, \"we are big fans of original song writing, when we found her we didn't want to give her someone else's song and we didn't want to compose for her because then it'd become our expression. We wanted thi to remain about the artist, we wanted this to be about her.\"\n\nThe series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with particular praise given to its new module, diversity, performances and \"Coke Studio\" efforts in showcasing and bringing the indigenous art form of Pakistan to the mainstream media. Television critic Shaheer Anwar of \"The Express Tribune\" said, \"the duo promised to bring a new flavour to the traditional Coke Studio and seem to have accomplished their goal so far by introducing Coke Studio Explorer. This is what many are calling a bonus to the upcoming season that aims to discover musical talent from all across Pakistan.\" Actor turned musician Arshad Mehmood said, \"the new season of \"Coke Studio\" comes with a message of love, unity, passion and pride that is exceedingly relevant to the current times. It should be heard, savoured and celebrated.\" \"Forbes\" contributor journalist, Sony Rehman from Lahore marked, \"\"Coke Studio\"'s previous seasons have dealt with its fair share of criticism and mixed reactions over certain song selections and collaborations, gauging by \"Coke Studio Explorer\", it may just hit all the right notes this year.\"\n\nThe first episode garnered widespread critical acclaim, the team efforts were praised for bringing the culture of people of Kalash and highlighting their traditions. Shot in rural Sindh, second episode also received critical acclaim, where critics praised the duo for keeping the recording true to its origin. The third episode landscaped the rare form of traditional Balochi singing and like its predecessors the episode received critical acclaim for showcasing the indigenous culture and tradition. Fourth episode featured Canadian born Pakistani singer who was discovered by Kazi through her Instagram videos, the reviews for both song and episode was largely positive. The fifth and final episode opened to rave reviews, Shams Irfan of \"Kashmir Life\" wrote, \"the producers have deliberately attempted making it sort of nostalgic by getting back in Kashmir's time wrap-though not in this part of Kashmir-when the Vale was all about beauty and romance.\n"}

{"id": "42566085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42566085", "title": "Curse of Scotland", "text": "Curse of Scotland\n\nThe Curse of Scotland is a nickname used for the Nine of Diamonds playing card. The expression has been used at least since the early 18th century, and many putative explanations have been given for the origin of this nickname for the card.\n\nIn a book printed in London in 1708, \"The British Apollo, or, Curious amusements for the ingenious\", a question is posed:\n\nQ. \"Why is the\" Nine of Diamonds \"called\" the curse of Scotland?\nA. Diamonds as the Ornamental Jewels of a Regnal Crown, imply no more in the above-nam'd Proverb than a mark of Royalty, for SCOTLAND'S \"Kings\" for many Ages, were observ'd, each \"Ninth\" to be a \"Tyrant\", who by Civil Wars, and all the fatal consequences of intestine discord, plunging the \"Divided Kingdom\" into strange Disorders, gave occasion, \"in the course of time\", to form the Proverb.\n\nA similar book of 1726 gives the same question and answer, still regarding the question as relating to a proverb. By 1757 the card was described as \"commonly called the Curse of Scotland\" with the explanation that the epithet refers to Lord Ormistoune, Lord Justice Clerk from 1692 to 1735, who suppressed the Jacobite rising of 1715 and \"became universally hated in Scotland\". In 18th-century Scotland, the nine of diamonds was sometimes called the \"Justice Clerk\", and was considered to be the most unlucky card in the pack.\n\nJames Mitchell's 1825 \"Scotsman's Library\" claimed that the expression originated from the Duke of Monmouth writing orders on such a card before the Battle of Bothwell Bridge (1679).\nDespite this, in \"The Spectator\", a reviewer of an 1885 book by George Gomme commented that the reviewer had believed that the phrase had started from an order written on a 9 by the Duke of Cumberland (\"Butcher\" Cumberland) on the eve of the Battle of Culloden (1746). However he went on to remark that the book claims that \"The curse of Scotland must be something which that nation hates and detests. The Scots held in the utmost detestation the Pope.\"\nIn the card game Pope Joan, very popular in the 19th century, the 9 is the most powerful card, and it is called the \"Pope\". The game is played on a special board on which the middle is marked \"Pope Joan\", and it is used in association with this card. The game uses 51 cards (the 8 is excluded, making the 7, later called the \"beer card\", a \"stop\") but there is no direct relation with the 9. Gomme's book goes on to claim \"At the game of Pope Joan, the nine of diamonds is Pope; therefore the nine of diamonds is the curse of Scotland\". \"The Spectator\" review considered the claim \"more cogent in form than in matter\".\nA letter written in response to \"The Spectator's\" book review pointed out that the saying was established well before Culloden, and preferred the Pope Joan theory to other explanations.\n\nOther explanations given in the letter were:\n\n\nAn 1864 book by Robert Chambers, upon which this letter seems to have been based, describes the theories as \"most lame and unsatisfactory suggestions\" compared with the Dalrymple theory. The book dismisses the Culloden theory because of an earlier 1745 caricature of \"the young chavalier attempting to lead a herd of bulls, laden with papal curses, excommunications &c., across the Tweed, with the Nine of Diamonds lying before them\".\n\nIn the 1898 edition of \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" the \"Pope Joan\" and \"Comette\" theories are favoured although many of the others are listed – more recent editions venture no opinion. In Gurney Benham's book about playing cards, in describing the game of Pope Joan he gives his own explanation for why this card is known as the Curse of Scotland: \"The crown of Scotland contained only nine stones, as they never could afford a tenth\". Eric Partridge's \"Routledge Dictionary of Historical Slang\" considers: “the various theories are as interesting as they are unconvincing”. \"Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland\" says for \"Curse of Scotland\" \"This is usually taken to be the nine of diamonds playing card, though explanations differ\".\n\nThe 19th century Tarot of Marseilles is one of the standard designs for tarot cards. It contains a \"Pope\" card (and, indeed, a \"Popess\") but there seems to be no connection with the Pope Joan card game, even though the popess may have derived from the mythical Pope Joan.\n\nThe expression \"Curse of Scotland\" is sometimes used simply to refer to an occasion of bad luck at cards and can also refer to generally unwanted situations in Scotland, such as swarms of midges. There is a theatrical superstition, sometimes called the \"Scottish curse\", that speaking the name \"Macbeth\" in the theatre brings bad luck. Hence \"the Scottish Play\" is used to refer to Shakespeare's play.\n"}

Roth was an important contributor to Richard Kaufman's \"Coinmagic\" an influential text on contemporary coin technique; his major work was chronicled in \"David Roth's Expert Coin Magic\", a book co-written with Richard Kaufman. Roth is now associated with Fantasma magic, a magic manufacturing and retail company in New York City.\n\nThe sleight of hand artist Dai Vernon, wrote about Roth:\n\n\"First let me state that David Roth has an amazing ability when performing with coins. He is truly a genius. I have been fortunate to have enjoyed the confidence and friendship of the leading exponents of coin manipulation of the past. T. Nelson Downs, Allan Shaw, Manuel and Welch Miller all specialized in this branch of the magical art. To the very best of my judgment, David’s ideas and execution far surpass any one of them. I feel quite certain that if they could witness his performance they would not only be astounded but realize that they had seen the master.\"\n\nRoth's trick \"The Hanging Coins\" (which was first revealed in \"Apocalypse\" magazine, Volume 1, No. 6, page 68, 1978) took an ancient, and long ignored, sleight-of-hand technique and made it far more deceptive and useful. This technique, which Roth dubbed \"Edge Grip,\" has subsequently been explored in depth by other experts in the field. It is a significant tool of contemporary coin magic.\n\nRoth's virtuoso execution of a \"persistence of vision vanish\" led to tremendous interest in his handling of the move (which he refers to \"The Retention Vanish\"), and – perhaps – to increased use of this move among magicians.\n\nRoth's handling and application of a technique that has – largely thanks to him – become known as \"The Shuttle Pass\" is highly influential.\n\nRoth's \"The Original Chinese Coin Assembly\" was highly influential as the first published coin assembly that used the bare hands. This was a highly influential development that has been widely used and explored by other sleight-of-hand experts.\n\n\nIn 2003, Roth co-wrote and co-starred along with Darwin Ortiz in \"All of the People, All of the Time\". It also co-starred actress Ruth Williamson and was co-written by Patrick Cook. It opened in Charlotte, North Carolina, and later played in Waterford, Connecticut.\n\nRoth has consulted for Ricky Jay's production of \"On The Stem\" as well as \"Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants\" in which he was credited in the program as Ricky's '53rd Assistant'.\n"}

{"id": "11364140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11364140", "title": "Digital terrestrial television in Canada", "text": "Digital terrestrial television in Canada\n\nDigital terrestrial television in Canada (often shortened to DTT) is transmitted using the ATSC standard. Because Canada and the U.S. use the same standard and frequencies for channels, people near the Canada–United States border can watch digital television programming from television stations in either country where available. The ATSC standards are also used in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Suriname and South Korea.\n\nJurisdiction over terrestrial broadcasting in Canada is primarily regulated by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada has jurisdiction over the allotment of the terrestrial spectrum and the CRTC has jurisdiction over the allotment of broadcast licences.\n\nThe CRTC imposed in 28 mandatory markets a digital transition deadline for full power transmitters of August 31, 2011, with the exception of some CBC transmitters. Two weeks before the deadline, the CBC transmitters were given a temporary one-year extension to remain in analog. No digital transition deadline has been set for low-power analogue transmitters and analog transmitters outside the 28 mandatory markets.\n\nIn January 2007, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada stopped issuing licences within Canada for new television transmitters broadcasting in analogue.\n\nAll remaining analog terrestrial television signals across Canada are scheduled to be shutdown no later than 2022.\n\nThe digital television transition in Canada and the United States will result in spectrum on channels 52 to 69 being re-allocated for other purposes. The United States government already auctioned most of this spectrum and Canada is planning on doing the same. The United States government, using some proceeds of the spectrum auction, funded an education campaign in advance of the transition, provided subsidies to many broadcasters in support of transitioning to digital, and provided subsidies to consumers for digital to analogue converter boxes. In contrast, the Canadian government did not provide any similar funding in support of the digital television transition. The Canadian government's most visible efforts to support the public in the transition to digital over-the-air television has been in the form of a website entitled Canada's Transition to Digital Television (DTV) along with some newspaper, radio, and television advertisements in the month leading up to the transition deadline.\n\nEngineering firm Spectrum Expert Inc. estimated a total cost to Canadian broadcasters of $378-425 million to convert all 738 Canadian full-power television transmitters to DTV on their newly assigned channels; if the 1238 low-power transmitters were converted, costs would increase further. Some of the highest costs were for existing full-power VHF rebroadcast transmitters that would have to be replaced by new UHF facilities in locations far from broadcast studios. As a worst case, CTV-owned CJOH-TV-6 and CJOH-TV-8 were estimated at a conversion cost of over four million dollars each. WhileDigital Television (DTV) Transition Schedule - Industry Canada CTV had threatened to shut down a long list of these full-power rebroadcasters on August 31, 2009, the transmitters are still on the air.\n\nSeveral broadcasters, including the CBC, argued that there is no viable business case for a comprehensive digital conversion strategy in Canada. Converting a transmitter to digital has up front capital equipment costs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which can in more extreme cases reach over a million dollars, though some cost recovery in energy costs is possible due to lower transmission power required to cover an area as compared to analog, if the same channel is used. At CRTC hearings in 2007 on the future direction of regulatory policy for television, broadcasters proposed a number of strategies, including funding digital conversion by eliminating restrictions on the amount of advertising that television broadcasters are permitted to air, allowing terrestrial broadcasters to charge cable viewers a subscription fee (fee-for-carriage) similar to that already charged by cable specialty channels, permitting licence fees similar to those that fund the BBC in the United Kingdom, or eliminating terrestrial television broadcasting entirely and moving to an exclusively cable-based distribution model.\n\nThe CRTC ultimately decided to relax restrictions on advertising, gradually removing all limits to the number of advertisements per hour of broadcast programming, as the funding mechanism. However, a CRTC statement issued in June 2008 indicated that as of that date, only 22 digital transmitters had been fully installed across the entire country, and expressed the regulator's concern that Canada's television broadcasters were not adequately preparing for the shift to digital broadcasting.\n\nThe US financial crisis and subsequent 2008 recession adverserly affected advertising sales, the primary source of revenue for most broadcasters. Inadequate revenue in combination with debt incurred from purchasing other media companies caused Canwest, owner of the Global Television Network, to file for bankruptcy protection and to be subsequently purchased by Shaw Communications. Some Global Television Network and CTV stations in smaller markets were closed or sold. Seeking further sources of revenue, the television broadcasters including CTV launched an aggressive and somewhat successful campaign to re-open debate for introducing value for signal from cable and satellite television providers) debate in 2009.\n\nOn August 6, 2010, CBC/Radio-Canada announced in a press release that only its existing digital stations, along with both Alberta CBC Television originating stations plus all Télévision de Radio-Canada (SRC) originating stations in Quebec City and Moncton, would be DTV-ready in time for the August 2011 deadline. The remaining CBC/SRC originating O&Os were to be converted a year later in August 2012, subject to CRTC approval. In December 2010, CBC/Radio-Canada updated the information on its website to state that it was striving to convert originating O&O by August 31, 2011. CBC stated that it does not intend on transitioning any of its full-power repeaters to digital, despite in some cases being in markets (such as Kitchener, London and Saskatoon) required to convert by August 31, 2011.\n\nIn many instances, stations transitioning to digital continued utilizing the same channel, antenna or other facilities for their new digital transmitters after the end of transition. To save costs, with the exception of some stations in the largest markets, stations chose to flash cut from analogue to digital at the transition deadline rather than spending on the infrastructure and energy costs needed to broadcast the station in analogue and digital at the same time.\n\nLeading up to the transition deadline, CRTC expressed concern that \"if all broadcasters wait until the last moment to proceed to the transition, there could be a shortage of professional engineers and competent technicians capable of assuming the development of new plans and the installation of new systems and structures\". Due to limited engineering resources, Global Television Network flash cut its transmitters over a 2-month period leading up to the deadline and TV Ontario flash cut its transmitters two weeks before the deadline. In contrast, most other networks and stations converted at the deadline.\n\nThere are no requirements for new televisions sold in Canada to include digital tuners (as they must in the US market), nor are there any labelling requirements for analogue-only receivers; some new televisions may be unable to tune a digital signal without an external ATSC tuner. , an estimated 900000 Canadians relying on antennas prior to the transition deadline were expected to lose over-the-air television reception by the transition deadline, as they are not ready for the digital transition. While a new HDTV receiver connected to a terrestrial television antenna will receive OTA digital television, Canadian regulations do not require cable television operators to carry these free local HDTV signals in unencrypted digital format on their systems.\n\nCITY-TV was the first Canadian station to provide digital terrestrial service, first broadcasting in January 2003, and going full-time in March 2003. The first HD broadcast in Canada was CBC Sports' coverage of the Heritage Classic, an outdoor NHL game. CBC ultimately launched a high definition feed of their eastern (Toronto) flagship CBLT in 2005, later launching feeds in Vancouver, Ottawa, and Montreal. As of 2008, other digital stations on-air included the CBC and Radio-Canada stations in Toronto and Montreal, as well as CTV's CFTO and CIVT, and Quebecor Media's independent station CKXT.\n\nThe first Canadian broadcaster to have delivered a digital-only terrestrial TV signal of any type, CKXT-TV (in Ottawa and London), signed on its pair of digital-only transmitters in 2008. These were both rebroadcasters of the same Toronto station with no local programme origination; the main Toronto station transmitted in both analogue and digital format. The first stations to complete the digital transition (on their main signals) were Trois-Rivières, Quebec's CFKM-DT, followed by CISA-DT in Lethbridge, Alberta.\n\nAs of July 2011, digital television broadcasts had commenced in just 11 of Canada's largest markets, but nearly all of the stations in mandatory markets ended up meeting the transition deadline. The stations that did not meet the deadline fall into two categories. First, there were some stations that had delays in converting to digital due to financial or technical issues. Second, are the CBC rebroadcaster transmitters in mandatory markets, and CTV's Access transmitters in Calgary, AB and Edmonton, AB. In CBC's case, the CBC obtained an over year extension to convert its transmitters, publicly stating that it was not planning on converting these transmitters. CBC later announced that all its analogue transmitters will be permanently shut down on July 31, 2012 and will not be replaced. In the case of CTV's Access transmitters, the network chose to shut them down at the transition deadline rather than converting them to digital.\n\nBroadcasting digital terrestrial signals instead of analog offers numerous advantages to the viewer, such as the following: support for high definition (HD) picture, support for 5 speaker surround sound, support for information on the current and the next few programs shown on the channel, support for sub-channels, Solomon-Reed error correction to eliminate multipath (ghosting), and support for mobile devices (i.e. ATSC-M/H). Canadian broadcasters have implemented many of the listed features to varying extents. CJON-DT in St. John's has become the first to offer different content on a subchannel, in the form of sister radio station CHOZ-FM on an audio-only subchannel, and CIII-DT in Toronto offers an SD simulcast of its HD feed on a subchannel, which is allowed under current CRTC licensing policies. On August 17, 2012, the CRTC gave approval to low-power community station CFTV-TV in Leamington, Ontario to broadcast four local subchannels on its digital signal, making it the first station in Canada to launch original content on its multiplex channels. Further, there are currently no transmitters broadcasting TV signals intended for mobile devices, though CBLFT-DT has done occasional test broadcasts of a mobile simulcast of sister station CBLT-DT in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThe Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) initially decided not to enforce a single date for ending analog broadcasts, opting to let market forces decide when the switchover will occur. It subsequently reversed its position, on May 17, 2007, setting an analogue shutoff date of August 31, 2011, just over two years after the American transition date of June 12, 2009. Mandatory markets with a transmitter that does not transition to digital by the deadline will lose the over-the-air signal for the corresponding station permanently or until a digital transmitter is brought on-the-air for that station in that area. Note that the transition deadline only concerns over-the-air signals and does not impact other televisions reception methods in Canada such as over the Internet (already digital), cable (some analog, most digital), or satellite (already digital).\n\nOn July 6, 2009, the CRTC issued a decision that limited the required digital conversion to mandatory markets meeting any of the following criteria:\n\nOn March 14, 2011, the CRTC removed territorial capitals as mandatory markets on the basis that these are small and remote markets, and that only 1 of the 6 transmitters in these markets were planned to be converted to digital, while the remainder of the transmitters would be shut down rather than converted.\n\nOn March 18, 2011, the CRTC mandated a requirement that television stations must broadcast public service announcements regarding the digital over-the-air television transition from May 1, 2011 until August 31, 2011. Stations must broadcast these ads 6 times a day, and increase this to 8 times a day starting August 1, 2011 or one month before the digital transition date for that station, whichever is sooner. Also by May 1, 2011, broadcasters must post on their websites about the broadcasters' specific plans for digital transition.\n\nOn August 18, 2011, the CRTC issued a decision that allowed CBC's mandatory market rebroadcasting transmitters in analogue to remain on-air until August 31, 2012. When the CRTC made this announcement, the CBC communicated that it planned on requesting an extension to remain broadcasting in analog past the August 31, 2012 deadline. Although the CRTC allowed the CBC the extension to remain in analogue, the corporation's full power transmitters occupying channels 52 to 69 were still required to either relocate to channels 2 to 51 or become low power transmitters. In some cases, CBC has opted reduce the power of existing transmitters to low power transmitters, which will result in signal loss for some viewers.\n\nList of Mandatory Markets:\n\nNote that the list below does not take into account plans of network affiliate stations.\n\nAlthough the majority of the over-the-air transmitters that were planned to be converted to digital made this conversion by August 31, 2011, a handful of stations had delays and were permitted to remain broadcasting in analog. In February 2012, CFTU-TV converted its transmitter to digital, marking the last of the mandatory market transmitters planned to become digital, to finally make the switch. This left 23 CBC and SRC rebroadcast transmitters in mandatory markets being required to transition to digital by August 31, 2012, though the CBC shut down all of its remaining analog television transmitters on July 31, 2012, with no further transmitters made digital.\n\nFollowing the August 31, 2011 deadline, some channels requested to make changes to their digital transmitters to improve the signal. Requested changes included the following (note that this is a list of applications to the CRTC and does not reflect what the CRTC has approved or what has been implemented):\n\nMost stations have announced no plans for converting or shutting down analog transmitters outside mandatory markets required to transition to digital by August 31, 2011, but here are some exceptions:\n\nThe 700 MHz band, occupying channels 52 to 69, occupied by television transmitters, is being re-allocated for mobile telecommunications devices and public safety communication. The mobile telecommunications portion of the spectrum is to be auction by the Canadian government to telecommunications companies in 2013. Industry Canada stopped issuing broadcast certificates for the upper part of this channel range in 2000 and the remainder of this channel range in 2007. On August 22, 2011, the United States' Federal Communications Commission announced a freeze on all future applications for broadcast stations requesting to use channel 51, to prevent adjacent-channel interference to the 700 MHz band. On December 16, 2011, Industry Canada placed a moratorium on future television stations using Channel 51 for broadcast use, to prevent adjacent-channel interference to the 700 MHz band.\n\nAll remaining transmitters occupying channels 52 to 69 are low power analog and no new transmitters are allowed to be added to this channel range. The Government of Canada has not set a deadline for low power transmitters to vacate this channel range. Industry Canada has proposed that if notification is given for a transmitter to cease transmitting within this channel range, it will have 2 years to vacate the channel, if in a rural area, and 1 year, if it is in an urban area. All of the remaining transmitters in the channel 52 to 69 range, are subject to the 2-year notification period.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, CBC / SRC and TVOntario shut down all of their analogue transmitters, resulting in a combined total of 21 transmitters shutting down from the channel 52 to 69 range.\n\nAs of January 2013, based on Industry Canada's database of TV transmitters and based on transmitters known to have been permanently shut down, there are 15 remaining television transmitters occupying channels 52 to 69, all low power analog, located in the following communities:\n\nExcept for the transmitter in Santa Rosa, the transmitters in the channel 52 to 69 range are all community operated transmitters.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "534516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=534516", "title": "Fabliau", "text": "Fabliau\n\nA fabliau (plural fabliaux) is a comic, often anonymous tale written by jongleurs in northeast France between ca. 1150 and 1400. They are generally characterized by sexual and scatological obscenity, and by a set of contrary attitudes—contrary to the church and to the nobility. Several of them were reworked by Giovanni Boccaccio for the \"Decameron\" and by Geoffrey Chaucer for his \"Canterbury Tales\". Some 150 French fabliaux are extant, the number depending on how narrowly \"fabliau\" is defined. According to R. Howard Bloch, fabliaux are the first expression of literary realism in Europe.\n\nSome nineteenth-century scholars, most notably Gaston Paris, argue that fabliaux originally came from the Orient and were brought to the West by returning crusaders \n\nThe fabliau is defined as a short narrative in (usually octosyllabic) verse, between 300 and 400 lines long, its content often comic or satiric. In France, it flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries; in England, it was popular in the 14th century. Fabliau is often compared to the later short story; Douglas Bush, longtime professor at Harvard University, called it \"a short story broader than it is long.\"\n\nThe fabliau is remarkable in that it seems to have no direct literary predecessor in the West, but was brought from the East by returning crusaders in the 12th century. The closest literary genre is the fable as found in Aesop \"and its eastern origins or parallels,\" but it is less moral and less \"didactic\" than the fable. Indeed, the word is a northern French diminutive from \"fable\"..\" In terms of morality it is suggested to be closer to the novel than to the parable: \"the story is the first thing, the moral the second, and the latter is never suffered to interfere with the former.\" Still, according to Robert Lewis, \"some two-thirds of the French fabliaux have an explicit moral attached to them.\"\n\nThe earliest known fabliau is the anonymous \"Richeut\" (ca. 1159-1175); one of the earliest known writers of fabliaux is Rutebeuf, \"the prototype of the jongleur of medieval literature.\"\n\nThe genre has been quite influential: passages in longer medieval poems such as \"Le Roman de Renart\" as well as tales found in collections like Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Decamerone\" and Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" have their origin in one or several fabliaux. Additionally, the medieval church also found use for the fabliau form. Noting its popularity, the church turned to their own form of minstrelsy similar to the fabliau that espoused \"worthy thoughts\" rather than the \"ribaldry\" a more typical fabliau would couch its moral in.\n\nWhen the fabliau gradually disappeared, at the beginning of the 16th century, it was replaced by the prose short story, which was greatly influenced by its predecessor. Famous French writers such as Molière, Jean de La Fontaine, and Voltaire owe much to the tradition of the fabliau.\n\nTypical fabliaux contain a vast array of characters, including cuckolded husbands, rapacious clergy, and foolish peasants, as well as beggars, connivers, thieves, and whores. Two groups are often singled out for criticism: the clergy and women. The status of peasants appears to vary, based on the audience for which the fabliau was being written. Poems that were presumably written for the nobility portray peasants (\"vilains\" in French) as stupid and vile, whereas those written for the lower classes often tell of peasants getting the better of the clergy.\n\nThe audience for fabliaux is estimated differently by different critics. Joseph Bedier suggests a bourgeois audience, which sees itself reflected in the urban settings and lower-class types portrayed in fabliaux. On the other hand, Per Nykrog argues that fabliaux were directed towards a noble audience, and concludes that fabliaux were the impetus for literary refreshment.\n\nThe subject matter is often sexual: fabliaux are concerned with the elements of love left out by poets who wrote in the more elevated genres such as Ovid, who suggests in the \"Ars Amatoria\" (II.704-5) that the Muse should not enter the room where the lovers are in bed; and Chrétien de Troyes, who maintains silence on the exact nature of the joy discovered by Lancelot and Guinevere in \"Le Chevalier de la Charrette\" (4676-4684). \"Lais\" and fabliaux have much in common; an example of a poem straddling the fence between the two genres is \"Lecheor\".\n\nFabliaux derive a lot of their force from puns and other verbal figures; indeed, \"fabliaux . . . are obsessed with wordplay.\" Especially important are paranomasia and catachresis, tropes which disrupt ordinary signification and displace ordinary meanings—by similarity of sound, for instance, one can have both \"con\" and \"conte\" (\"cunt\" and \"tale\") in the same word, a common pun in fabliaux.\n\nThe standard form of the fabliau is that of Medieval French literature in general, the octosyllable rhymed couplet, the most common verse form used in verse chronicles, romances (the \"romans\"), \"lais\", and \"dits\". They are generally short, a few hundred lines; Douin de L'Avesne's \"Trubert\", at 2984 lines, is exceptionally long.\n\nFamous writers of fabliau include Jean Bodel, Garin, Gautier le Leu, Rutebeuf, Enguerrant le Clerc d'Oisi and Douin de L'Avesne.\n\nSome representative tales:\n\nA well-known storyline is found in \"Gombert et les deus clers\" (\"Gombert and the two clerks\"). Two traveling clerks (students) take up lodging with a \"villain\", and share the bedroom with Gombert, his beautiful wife, and their two children—one teenage girl, and one baby. One of the clerks climbs into bed with the teenage daughter and, promising her his ring, has his way with her; the other, while Gombert is \"ala pissier\" (\"gone pissing,\" 85), moves the crib with the baby so that Gombert, on his return, lies down in the bed occupied by the clerks—one of whom is in bed with his daughter, while the other is now having sex with Gombert's wife, who thinks it's Gombert come to pleasure her. When the first clerk returns to his bed where he thinks his friend still is, he tells Gombert all about his adventure: \"je vien de fotre / mes que ce fu la fille a l'oste\" (\"I've just been fucking, and if it wasn't the host's daughter,\" 152-53). Gombert attacks the first clerk, but ends up being beaten up by both.\n\nThe tale is found practically unchanged in Boccaccio's \"Decamerone\" and in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Reeve's Tale.\"\n\nIn \"L'enfant de neige\" (\"The snow baby\"), a black comedy, a merchant returns home after an absence of two years to find his wife with a newborn son. She explains one snowy day she swallowed a snowflake while thinking about her husband which caused her to conceive. Pretending to believe the \"miracle\", they raise the boy until the age of 15 when the merchant takes him on a business trip to Genoa. There, he sells the boy into slavery. On his return, he explains to his wife that the sun burns bright and hot in Italy; since the boy was begotten by a snowflake, he melted in the heat.\n\nDe Bérangier au lonc cul is a medieval French fabliau. There are two versions of the fabliau: one by Guerin and one anonymous. In summary, the story begins when a rich earl marries his daughter off to a \"young peasant\" and deems him a knight. The knight abandons the code of chivalry and lazes around for the first ten years of the marriage. When his wife, tired of his demeaning attitude and lazy nature, speaks of the greatness of the knights in her family, the husband decides to prove himself a worthy knight. He dresses in armor and goes into the forest on horseback. Once in the forest, he hangs his shield on the lowest branch of a tree and beats it until it looks as if it endured a great battle. The knight returns to his wife, shows her his bruised armor, and gloats about his victories. After a few trips into the forest, the wife begins to wonder why the knight himself is unscathed while his armor is in shambles. The next day, she suggests he take servants with him. When he refuses, the lady dresses in a full body suit of armor and follows him into the forest. When she sees him beating his own shield, she steps into sight and threatens to kill him for his dishonor to chivalry. The knight does not recognize his wife's voice. He begs for \"pity\" and offers to do anything to avoid conflict. His wife, disguised as a mighty knight, gives him the option of jousting her, in which he will surely die, or kissing her arse. Out of cowardice, the knight chooses to kiss her arse. She hops off her horse and pulls down her pants. While the knight should have recognized her female genitalia, he remarks that she has a long arse. Before she leaves, she tells him, \"I'm Bérangier of the Long Ass, Who puts shame to the chickenhearted.\" The wife returns home and sleeps with a valiant knight. When her husband arrives from the forest, he rebukes her. However, that was his last demeaning remark to her. She tells him she met Bérangier and learned of her husband's cowardice. To protect his own name, the knight is forced to succumb to his wife's wishes. Her cleverness leads her to do as she pleased for the rest of her life, and her husband lives in shame.\n\nThe husband's initial antagonistic behavior cues the gender moral of the story: constantly demeaning a clever wife can be dangerous. In order to find out her husband, the wife disguises herself as a knight who she calls “Bérangier au lonc cul” [Bérangier of the long ass]. She follows her husband into the forest, and, upon seeing his foolish actions, “the roles are reversed”. Whereas the woman previously had “[caught] the brunt of [her husband’s] bragging and insults,” seeing the “absolute farce” of his claims in the forest inspires her to become a “hard, driving force that will not only teach him a lesson but also will annihilate him in position as leader in the household”. Upon the encounter with his wife, disguised as a valiant knight, the husband automatically reveals his cowardice and, out of terror, begs for mercy. His wife gives him an ultimatum: he can “jostez” [joust] and surely die or “vos me venroiz el cul baisier” [kiss her ass]. Without realizing the gravity of his decision, he yields the power in his marriage to his wife, reversing his position of power, when he refuses to fight the knight. In addition, he displays ignorance when he does not recognize her genitals; he merely thought the knight had “au lonc cul” [a long ass]. In an exploitation of his ignorant failure to recognize her female genitals, the wife and the audience share pleasure in the fact she has duped her husband and the fact he will never know. The story “draw[s] a conventional lesson about proper gender roles in marriage,” which suggests the demeaning of a wife by a husband is not “proper.” Thus, the reversal of the gender roles in this story creates the moral.\n\nOther popular fabliaux include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

These women imagined an architecture that challenged the way the traditional family would live. They practiced architecture with what they considered feminist theories or approaches. The rediscovery of architecture through feminist theory is not limited to female architects. Architects like Le Corbusier and Adolf Loos have also had their architecture reexamined through feminist theory.\n\nIn Dolores Hayden's book \"The Grand Domestic Revolution\" she explains the ways in which \"a lost feminine tradition\" led to a \"redefining of house work and the housing needs of women and their families, push[ing] architects and urban planners to reconsider the effects of design on family life\". This idea of the changing needs of the family can be seen in the houses of Truus Schröder, Eileen Gray and LeCorbusier's Villa Stein de-Monzie. The Rietveld Schröder House is an excellent example of the way that the \"modern\" lives of the family demanded a new architecture.\n\n\"The Schröder House was not only a creative work of artistic design but offered its users a new environment in which to redefine family life, women's rights and the responsibilities of individuals and to each other\"\n\nThe movable walls and partitions give a sense of consciousness and an overall feeling that the architecture was built with a greater purpose. The fact that Truus Schröder's beliefs in the family and as the house playing a part in the family; the house almost as a member. Truus Schröder is closely related to Dutch and European feminism of the twentieth century, based on her goals for her house.\n\nEileen Gray's E-1027 is another example of feminist theory being applied to architecture.\n\nMuch like Schröder, Gray designed an architecture that would address the needs of the occupants and the new family unit. Gray worked within the model of modern architecture, LeCorbusier's \"5 points of new architecture\" for example as well as addressing the issues of the building or home as an experience.\n\nLike E1027 and The Schroder House, Villa Stein de Monzie was rediscovered through feminist theory. More well known is the way in which this house called gender relations and the way in which the relationship between men and women was negotiated in a new way.\n\nThis house is of particular importance in feminist theory because it called into question the typical domestic group and gender relations. This domestic group that included a married couple and a woman with her child called domestic space into question.\n\n"}
{"id": "47380241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47380241", "title": "First interracial kiss on television", "text": "First interracial kiss on television\n\nThe first interracial kiss on television is a much debated topic concerning who the first two persons of different races to kiss on television were. For a time, it was understood to have occurred during an episode of the British soap opera \"Emergency – Ward 10\" in 1964. However, in November 2015, a Granada \"Play of the Week\", \"You in Your Small Corner\", was uncovered which was broadcast in June 1962; that quickly led to the rediscovery of another play featuring the same young Jamaican actor, \"Hot Summer Night\", televised in Britain on 1 February 1959. The first interracial kiss on U.S. television was broadcast in a 1960 episode of \"Adventures in Paradise\", \"Makaha Surfing\", also known as \"The Big Surf\", between star Gardner McKay and Filipina Pilar Seurat. Competing claims have also been made in favour of \"I Love Lucy\".\n\nIn June 1962, a live performance of the play \"You in Your Small Corner\" by Barry Reckord was broadcast on British television as part of the series Granada \"Play of the Week\". The central theme of the play is a relationship between a young black intellectual and a white working class girl. During the play, a kiss takes place between actors Lloyd Reckord and Elizabeth MacLennan, and what has been described as an \"explicit post-coital scene\".\n\n\"You In Your Small Corner\" was rediscovered during preparations for a November 2015 British Film Institute panel discussion on \"Race and Romance on TV\" and was used in publicity for the event. As a result, panel moderator Samira Ahmed was able, on the night, to announce the rediscovery of an even earlier TV kiss by Lloyd Reckord, with Andrée Melly, in the ITV Armchair Theatre adaptation of Ted Willis's play \"Hot Summer Night\", broadcast on 1 February 1959.\n\nOne of the earliest interracial kisses on television occurred in a July 1964 episode of British soap opera \"Emergency Ward 10\", during which characters Louise Mahler (portrayed by Joan Hooley) and Giles Farmer (portrayed by John White) kissed. The scene in which Mahler and Farmer kissed was originally scripted to occur in Mahler's bedroom, but was rewritten so as to occur outdoors, due to concerns it would otherwise be too risqué (the earlier Lloyd Reckord plays had both been shown well after the 9pm adult-content watershed). According to an issue of the \"Daily Express\" published after the episode aired, \"not a viewer rang-up to complain\". In a 2015 interview, conducted prior to the discovery of the \"You in Your Small Corner\" footage, Hooley noted that the historic importance of what had been known as the \"first interracial kiss on television\" had been inflated in popular memory:\n\nThe 1950s American television programme \"I Love Lucy\" broadcast multiple instances of real-life husband and wife Desi Arnaz, a Hispanic male, and Lucille Ball, a woman of North European ancestry, kissing. However, despite Arnaz and Ball being frequently described as an \"interracial couple\", \"Hispanic\" is generally understood to be a catchall indicating persons of a Latin American, Spanish, or Filipino cultural background, as opposed to a race. Arnaz was usually considered to be a white male of Cuban ancestry.\n\nAn episode of \"Adventures in Paradise\" titled \"The Big Surf,\" broadcast in 1960, featured two scripted kisses: One between actress Pilar Seurat and actor Robert Sampson, and another with Seurat and Gardner McKay.\n\nAn episode of \"I Spy\" titled \"The Tiger\" broadcast on January 5, 1966, featured a scripted interracial kiss between Eurasian actress France Nuyen and Robert Culp.\n\nA December 1967 episode of \"Movin' with Nancy\" featured a kiss between Nancy Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr.\n\nA 1968 episode of \"\", \"Plato's Stepchildren\", which first aired on November 22, 1968, is often referred to as the first interracial kiss on American television. This claim is disputed by some who contend that in the scene in question, full lip contact between William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols did not occur, as the actors turned their heads away from the camera at the last moment to present the illusion of a kiss, meaning that this scene was not a true kiss. The latter point has been disputed, with Shatner claiming that he and Nichols' lips never fully touched and Nichols asserting that the kiss was real.\n\nIt is often ignored that \"\", which originally aired on October 6, 1967, featured a scripted interracial kiss between Eurasian actress Barbara Luna and the aforementioned William Shatner a year prior.\n\n"}
{"id": "556147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=556147", "title": "Grimlock", "text": "Grimlock\n\nGrimlock is the name of several fictional robot characters in the Transformers robot franchise. He is usually portrayed as the immensely strong, power-mongering leader of the Dinobots, a small subfaction of Autobots that transform into dinosaurs. In 2007, \"USA Today\" polled people as to which Transformer they want to appear in the in the \"Transformers\" film series; Grimlock came in tied for second with Devastator.\n\nGrimlock is the leader of the Dinobots, as well as the most fearsome and powerful member. Grimlock can be cold, merciless and contemptuous of those he considers beneath him, such as human beings, and at times, even Autobot leader Optimus Prime himself, who Grimlock would gladly supplant as Autobot leader if he were able to, giving him a superiority complex as indicated by his Generation 1 tech specs. Nevertheless, he is a valiant warrior whose actions command respect from all who are witness to them, both friend and foe. One of his most distinguishing features is his famous speech impediment, which leads him to shorten sentences and refer to himself constantly as \"Me Grimlock\", never \"I\" (e.g. \n\"Me Grimlock no bozo! Me KING!\") - the reason for this varies from depiction to depiction, with some making it the result of true mental limitations, and others vocal processor damage or a ruse Grimlock perpetrates to allow others to think of him as less intelligent than he actually is. However he is still an Autobot and is willing to protect the Earth as much as the Autobots, and does also show a begrudging respect for Optimus Prime, however he was more accepting for Rodimus as leader when he became a Prime.\n\nGrimlock is among the strongest of the Transformers, possibly an equal to, or even superior to Optimus Prime and Megatron in certain continuities (he was shown to be stronger than Megatron in the G1 cartoon, but in the Marvel comics, Megatron was able to defeat Grimlock and the rest of the Dinobots in their initial encounter). In \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" mode, his powerful jaws can snap virtually anything that comes between them - from steel cables to a Decepticon limb. He also can breathe fire and shoot an energy ray from his mouth. In robot mode, Grimlock wields an energon sword, whose blade is sheathed in crackling energon and can slice a concrete wall in one slash. He also uses a double-barreled, self-propelled rocket launcher. He is almost invulnerable in his Tyrannosaurus Rex mode as shown with his battle with Megatron due to Megatron's primary weapon, his arm-mounted fusion cannon having little or no effect on Grimlock. Grimlock is the only Dinobot whose name doesn't begin with an S.\n\nGrimlock was one of the favorite Autobots of IGN.\n\nGrimlock was voted the 6th top Transformer who was considered to be \"badass\" in the comics by Topless Robot.\n\nAccording to X-Entertainment Grimlock was the 2nd top Transformers figure of all time.\n\nThe original character profiles (and the tech specs derived from them) written by Bob Budiansky and Dan Bobro indicate that Grimlock and the Dinobots were intended to come from Cybertron to Earth like the vast majority of other Transformers. However, the cartoon would diverge wildly from this when it introduced the reptilian robots. Grimlock is voiced by Gregg Berger.\n\nThe discovery of fossilized dinosaur bones in a cavern in their volcano base set the Earthbound Autobots on the track to creating the Dinobots. Intrigued by the creatures, and with additional knowledge supplied by Spike Witwicky, Wheeljack and Ratchet created three \"Dinobots\" – Grimlock, Slag and Sludge. It has not been explained why he or the other Dinobots were able to be fitted with personalities which can only be found on Cybertron from Vector Sigma. Their brains are simple, yet still it is the personalities that make them sentient. It is evident that addition of personalities or \"sparks\" and its origin was after the fact, and was hoped that this inconsistency would be overlooked.\n\nTheir design specs proved to be too accurate to the creatures they were modeled on, as their primitive brains went out of control, and Grimlock almost destroyed Teletraan I, before the trio was stopped. Optimus Prime deemed them too dangerous to use again, and had them sealed back up in the cavern, but when the majority of the Autobot force was captured by the Decepticons, Wheeljack freed them to go to their rescue. Equipped with new devices that enhanced their brainpower to functional, yet still impaired, levels (resulting in slow thought processes and simple, clipped speech), the three Dinobots successfully rescued their Autobot comrades, and Optimus Prime admitted his error.\n\nIn his private thoughts, however, Grimlock considered Optimus Prime too weak to lead, seeking the position for himself. When Soundwave read his mind and learned of this animosity, Megatron was able to trick Grimlock and the Dinobots into switching sides, attacking and capturing Optimus Prime. To stop the turncoat Dinobots, two new ones were created: Snarl and Swoop. Ultimately, it was when Optimus Prime threw himself into harm's way to save Grimlock from an explosion that he accepted his mistake and rejoined the Autobots. In a rare display of modesty and humility, Grimlock emotionally apologized to Prime, admitted his jealousy of the leader, and accepted fault for the battle. The two subsequently patched up their differences.\n\nAlthough content for the moment to remain a soldier, rather than a leader, Grimlock still had trouble accepting orders, only agreeing to help stem the tide of natural disasters ravaging Earth due to Cybertron being pulled into its orbit when he realized he would die if he did not. Grimlock and the Dinobots were semi-regularly called into action when the Autobots were faced with challenges that required extra strength, such as the Sub-Atlantican invasion of Washington, D.C., or the Decepticons' control of the TORQ III supercomputer; with every piece of help he and his troops gave, Grimlock was never slow to add a scathing remark about the inabilities of the Autobots. That said, he was not unwilling to admit the failings of his own troops, either, and willingly took them to the time-displaced \"Dinobot Island\", where they trained in the wilderness and helped stop a Decepticon raid on the prehistoric paradise.\n\nThe final straw for Grimlock came when he and the Dinobots were injured in a Decepticon trap at an airfield. Enraged, Grimlock refused to take orders from Optimus Prime anymore, and he and the other Dinobots left. When the Autobots began to suffer from Cybertonium deficiency, Spike Witwicky and his girlfriend Carly attempted to persuade the Dinobots - who continued to function perfectly, as they had been built on Earth without Cybertonium - to steal some of the mineral from a Decepticon shipment coming in from Cybertron. Grimlock instead opted to lead the Dinobots to Cybertron itself, where they (except Swoop) were captured by Shockwave and put to work in the Cybertonium mines, until Swoop, Spike and Carly rescued them. Brought back to Earth, the Dinobots agreed to follow Prime's order again - until such time as Grimlock did not feel like it.\n\nBy the Earth year 2005, it seemed apparent that Grimlock had undergone some degree of a personality change, becoming more childish and petulant, rather than brutish and stubborn. He and the Dinobots accompanied Optimus Prime on the latter's rescue mission to Autobot City, and fought Devastator. Subsequently, the Dinobots joined Hot Rod and his companions in traveling back to Cybertron to face the evil Unicron. Also of note, it seemed that, along with the other Dinobots, Grimlock remained in his dinosaur mode almost exclusively, rarely changing back to his robot form. Throughout 2006, he regularly participated in missions with his fellow Autobots rather than the other Dinobots, battling on the planets of Chaar, Goo, Dredd and Eurythma.\n\nIn episode #78, \"Madman's Paradise\", Spike and Carly hosted a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Their son Daniel got bored and wandered off. Grimlock followed him, and they fell into a lost chamber where Quintessons banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the other-dimensional realm of Menonia, and were tricked into fighting on the Red Wizard's side, only to find out that he was the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the Golden One. Ultra Magnus, Blaster, Eject, Rewind, Ramhorn, and Steeljaw followed, and using Blaster's amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard. With the help of Perceptor, the Autobots and Daniel are returned to Cybertron.\n\nGrimlock helped to sniff out the \"dinosaur transform static\" that implicated Trypticon in the theft of world monuments. Later in the year, when Galvatron, the new Decepticon leader, had Cybertron infused with function-inverting anti-electrons, a dose of the particles gave Grimlock super-intelligence. For the first time Grimlock identified himself as \"I, Grimlock\". During a mission to Unicron's disembodied head, where the Autobots were outmatched by the new Decepticon Terrorcons, Grimlock used components of Unicron's head to construct the Technobots to battle them. Combined as Computron, the Technobots felt they could not match the Terrorcons, until Grimlock transferred his super-intelligence into Computron, reverting to his old self and allowing the Autobots to claim victory.\n\nGrimlock's greatest victory came when he and a large number of other Transformers with primitive animal-themed transformations were summoned to a world at the centre of the galaxy by the ex-assistant of the ancient genius, Primacron, creator of Unicron. The assistant had assembled these \"Primitive\" Transformers in the hope that their simple instincts could defeat Primacron's newest creation, Tornedron, but one by one they fell to him, with Grimlock apparently crushed under Trypticon. Grimlock survived, however, and followed Tornedron back to Primacron's lab. When Tornedron turned on his master, like his predecessor, Primacron's complicated plans and equations could not find a way to stop him; Grimlock, on the other hand, randomly flicked a switch which reversed Tornedron's energy polarity, undoing the damage the now dissipating Tornedron had done. Grimlock decimated Primacron's lab while dancing around over his successful saving of the universe, dubbing it the smartest thing he'd ever done.\n\nIn a comic story found in the \"Transformers\" DVD boxset for season 2, a special comic was donated by \"Darren Jamieson\" and \"Dylan Gibson\" that explored what happened when the Dinobots combined. Unleashed as a last-ditch effort by Grimlock to stop an Autobot massacre, \"The Beast\" was a huge mindless combiner that destroyed warriors on both sides.\n\nIn the year 2011, the Decepticons invaded Cybertron in full force. Grimlock was deployed by Wreck-Gar to fend off the invaders. He was seen fighting alongside his fellow Dinobots as well as the Throttlebots against the invading Decepticons, however, they didn't fare too well against the Decepticon Headmasters, as they are all quickly put to sleep by Mindwipe's hypnosis attack. In the second episode, Grimlock was again in action, trying to protect Vector Sigma along with two fellow Dinobots and Jazz.\n\nAfter the animated series ended in the US Grimlock appeared in animated form one last time in the commercial for the Classic Pretenders.\n\nGrimlock was featured in the 1985 Find Your Fate Junior book called \"Dinobots Strike Back\" by Casey Todd.\n\nGrimlock appeared in the 1986 story and coloring book \"The Lost Treasure of Cybertron\" by Marvel Books.\n\nGrimlock was featured in the 1993 \"Transformers: Generation 2\" coloring book \"Decepticon Madness\" by Bud Simpson.\n\nAlthough no Grimlock toy was made in the Transformers: Universe toy line, both Grimlock and his counterpart appeared in the storyline.\n\nThe Autobots returning to Cybertron along with Blackarachnia and Silverbolt were then abducted via teleportation beams and taken to Unicron. Tap-Out, Megatron, Brawn, War Within Grimlock and Snarl were also abducted from various timelines (Transformers: Universe #1).\n\n\"War Within\" Grimlock, \"Armada\" Megatron and \"Universe\" Optimus Primal are each transported to the Unicron world, where they eventually team up and fight Striker and Reptilion. Note, there is a small continuity error in that this story ends with Grimlock, Megatron and Primal standing over Reptilion, but issue #2 of the comic starts with them standing over Striker (2003 Botcon Voice Actor Play).\n\nAfter the events of the Botcon 2003 voice actor play, Optimus Primal is able to use his spark telepathy to free Striker from Unicron's influence. Optimus Primal, Megatron and Grimlock help break free the slaves from various timelines which are held there and gets them to Cybertron (Transformers: Universe #2).\n\nIn a story called \"By their Blasters you shall know them ...!\" from \"Transformers Comic-Magazin\" issue #12 by German comic publisher Condor Verlag Optimus Prime instructs Backstreet, Bumblebee and Ruckus on how to identify Autobots from Decepticons in battle using the Ark's computer. Pretender Grimlock is one of those he displays to the Autobots. He is identified as a Decepticon.\n\nGrimlock also appeared in several of the G.I. Joe vs the Transformers series from Devil's Due Publishing. In 2004 Grimlock was among the Autobots under the leadership Optimus Prime who attempted to take back the planet Cybertron from the Decepticon tyrant Shockwave. After an accident with the teleportational systems of the supercomputer Teletran-3, Grimlock found himself sent back in time and on the planet Earth. He was reformatted in the form of an Earth dinosaur with several other Autobots. A group of humans were able to bring the new Dinobots back to Cybertron and they helped overcome Shockwave.\n\nGrimlock returned in the third series as a main character. Grimlock, Arcee, Bumblebee and Perceptor were sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertronian technology on the planet. When Cobra attacked the base, the Autobots helped repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. This was simply a distraction, however, to allow Cobra Commander access to the real prize - Serpent O.R., a technorganic android created from the DNA of many great warleaders and parts from Megatron. Predictably the Megatron aspects took control and Serpent O.R. escaped, taking over the G.I. Joe battlesuits and forcing Grimlock and the other Autobots to battle them while he made his escape. The Autobots and Joes pursued him to Cybertron, where they were captured by Serpentor, the Predacons, the Seacons and the Stunticons. While Serpentor captured Optimus Prime, Snake-Eyes led a jailbreak, with Grimlock flattening Rampage in the process. He would then form part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe strike force to rescue Optimus Prime, at one point ripping a Decepticon prisoner's arm off to gain Prime's location. At the end, after Serpentor's defeat and Prime's rescue, Grimlock admitted he was wrong about the Joes, and that they were great heroes, warriors and friends.\n\nThere is a notable disparity in Grimlock's speech patterns between the second and third series. In the second series he is seen to speak normally, referring to himself as \"I\". However, in the third series he speaks in his more normal \"Me Grimlock\" speech.\n\nThe 21st century re-imagining of the original universe by Dreamwave Productions depicted Grimlock in a manner similar to his depiction in Marvel Comics - a powerful, cunning warrior who values strength of body and character. Through \"\", the company shaped a background on Cybertron for Grimlock which showed that he had participated in the planet's underground gladiatorial game in order to unleash the rage and anger he had always overflowed with. When Megatron began using the games to identify suitable soldiers for his burgeoning Decepticon army, Grimlock was recruited by him and initially fought on his side, befriending Starscream and perhaps the scientist, Jetfire, before defecting to the Autobots - not out of any particular fondness for them and their ideals, but rather out of sheer hatred of Megatron and his ideals. He still bears a particularly fierce grudge against Jetfire over an unspecified incident with a cerebro-shell.\n\nDuring the time Autobot leader Sentinel Prime was killed, Grimlock was an established, respected member of the Autobots (perhaps most remembered for his quote \"Me Grimlock, badass!!!\"). Grimlock questioned the new leadership of Optimus Prime, including Prime's first major decision to evacuate Cybertron over defending it. Witnessing and aiding him in battle with Megatron deep beneath Cybertron, however, Grimlock came to respect Prime as time passed. When Prime and Megatron disappeared in an early test of the experimental spacebridge transport system, disarray struck the Autobot and Decepticon ranks and they splintered off into numerous smaller factions - Grimlock founded the Lightning Strike Coalition to fight the battles he considered the most important.\n\nAs the \"Dark Ages\" came to an end, Ultra Magnus reunified the various Autobot factions, with Grimlock becoming something of his right-hand man. Starscream's Predacon faction attacked an attempted peace treaty between the Autobots, the Decepticons and Ratbat's Ultracons. As Grimlock leapt to Ultra Magnus's defence, he apparently perished - naturally, we know he later returned to life, but unfortunately, due to Dreamwave's closure, this story was never resolved, and Grimlock's restoration to life was left unexplained.\n\nWhat is known of the remainder of his time on Cybertron, however, is that he, Slag, Sludge, Snarl, and Swoop formed a team known as the \"Dynobots\" (they are referred to as such in the first issue of \"The Age of Wrath\"). The Dynobots remained on Cybertron when Optimus Prime left on The Ark, pursued by Megatron. When Optimus Prime and Megatron's troops vanished four million years ago, they pursued the Decepticons known as the Insecticons, who had set off in search of the missing leaders. The two teams battled on prehistoric Earth, and the battle ended with both sides trapped in stasis. The eventual awakening of Prime and Megatron's forces in 1984 was followed by the Autobots' discovery and reactivation of the Dynobots, now rechristened the \"Dinobots\" for their new dinosaur alternate modes.\n\nWhen the Transformers were all believed destroyed in the explosion of the ship that was taking them back to Cybertron, several of them, including Grimlock, were recovered by a rogue military faction and reprogrammed so that they could be operating as killing machines. Bumblebee, Frenzy, Grimlock, Laserbeak, Prowl, Ravage, Soundwave and Starscream were forced to attack the Smitco oil refinery in the Arctic to display their power for sale to the highest bidder (Transformer: Generation One #2).\n\nWhen Megatron liberated himself and several others from this control, Grimlock, tired of risking his life for the humans, joined him, ripping off his insignia and joining in the Decepticon attack on San Francisco, during which he was dispatched from behind by Trailbreaker. Left behind by the fleeing Decepticons, he subsequently located and liberated the other Dinobots, and headed for Cybertron. In the four-million-year interim, the planet had been unified by Shockwave for his own sinister ends, but once there, Grimlock led an assault on Iacon, providing enough chaos and unrest for Optimus Prime's Autobot underground to overthrow Shockwave's rule of Cybertron. Grimlock successfully hauled Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus to safety when Shockwave's citadel exploded.\n\nGrimlock's Pretender form is given an entry in the seventh issue of the More Than Meets the Eyes profile series, indictaing there may have been plans to make him a Pretender at some point in the Dreamwave universe.\n\nDreamwave's closure meant that they would tell no further stories of their Grimlock, although his \"War Within\"-era design did appear in the \"\" comic book exclusive to BotCon.\n\nGrimlock also appeared in the Dreamwave \"Transformers/G.I. Joe\" comic. Although not one of the Dinobots in this continuity, transforming into a Sherman Tank, this Grimlock shared the rebellious attitude and speech mannerisms of other incarnations of the G1 character, although he had a softer attitude towards humans. Reactivated by G.I. Joe to fight the Decepticons and Cobra, Grimlock battled Cobra forces and Rumble alongside Roadblock, although the Decepticon's piledriver arms nearly defeated them, with Grimlock telling Roadblock to leave him, until Bumblebee and Scarlett intervened. When Snake Eyes opened the Matrix on Prime's command, Grimlock was presumably deactivated.\n\nBased on the \"Transformers Classic\" toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel UK and \"Generation 2\" comics).\n\nWhen Bludgeon and his Decepticons were banished after the battle of Klo Grimlock refitted his Decepticon battleship, the Graviton, with weapons and recruited his several Dinobots and Autobots to hunt them down. The crew included Ultra Magnus, Springer, Huffer, Elita One, Snarl, Terranotron and the Mini-Cons Swoop and Strongarm. After getting word from Optimus Prime that Megatron was alive on Earth Grimlock left Ultra Magnus in charge of the Graviton and took a shuttle to Earth.\n\nIn the story \"Crossing Over\" by Fun Publications Grimlock was among Autobot troops of Optimus Prime who responded to the sighting of Megatron and arrived in time to save the dimensional traveling Autobot Skyfall from Megatron's wraith.\n\nIn \"Games of Deception\" the Graviton follows Bludgeon's agent Bugbite and several Decepticons to Earth where the Autobots join up with Grimlock. After a brief encounter with the Decepticons the Graviton leaves with Grimlock joining them.\n\nClassic Grimlock's biography was featured in issue #13 of the Transformers Collectors Club magazine.\n\nGrimlock appears in \"Beast Wars Shattered Glass Chapter One: Shattered Time\" by Fun Publications. In this story Ultra Magnus and the Autobots aboard the \"Graviton\" battle Megatron and the Decepticons aboard the \"Talon\". Both ships are pulled through a vortex into the past of \"Shattered Glass\" Earth. Crashing they discover that dangerous energon readings outside the ship will place them in stasis lock. The Autobots devise organic alternate modes to protect them from the energon. The Decepticons create energon-absorbing armor for protection. Grimlock takes on the alternate form of a white velociraptor (his \"Beast Wars\" toy). This team of animal-based Autobots eventually renamed themselves \"Maximals\" after encountering a member of that faction from an alternate universe.\n\nGrimlock and his fellow Maximals eventually joined forces with the heroic Decepticons-as opposed to their Megatron's renamed Predacons-under Galvatron. This would lead to Grimlock joining Galvatron in coming to the aid of Decepticon City on Earth when it was attacked by the Autobots in an effort to break the Decepticon war effort once and for all. Grimlock would be sent in to attack Superion, only to be overpowered after letting his guard down due to the humor-in his eyes, at least-of a Combiner made up of Micromasters. Fortunately, the Micromaster Predacons came to his aid and thwarted Superion's assault.\n\nKup told the Dinobots and Rodimus the story of how he became a member of the Autobot Elite Guard.\n\nGrimlock was also featured in the \"Beast Wars: Uprising\" storyline as a member of the Maximal-Predacon resistance movement instigated by Lio Convoy. Having transplanted his Spark into a Maximal protoform to avoid the immobility common among his fellow Autobot and Decepticon \"Builders,\" Grimlock launches a violent campaign seeking to topple the old regime and bring Cybertron under resistance rule. However, his extreme agenda eventually leads him to steal the G-Virus, a contagion born from the essence of the fallen Galvatron with the ability to remake any Cybertronian in his image. Grimlock soon leads his team to a gladitorial event, intent on unleashing the virus on the spectators, only to have the now Micromaster Hot Rod interfere. One of Grimlock's own subordinates then destroys most of the virus, unaware that a Cybertronian has already been affected and been turned into a new Galvatron.\n\nIn a flashback in \"Maximum Dinobots\" #1 Grimlock lead the Dinobots in taking a Decepticon energon silo in Sub-Sector Nine on Cybertron.\n\nIn the issue on Shockwave, Grimlock and the 'Dinobots' (sporting Cybertronian designs much like their War Within designs) appear in a story that partially pays homage to their Marvel G1 origin. Seeking payback for a humiliating defeat by Shockwave, Grimlock pursued him to prehistoric Earth (which Shockwave was seeding with Energon). In order to protect themselves against Energon surges, the Dinobots required alternate modes covered by a layer of synthetic flesh. Refusing to pick dying and thus weak Ice Age mammals for an alternate form, Grimlock chose to utilise more ferocious dinosaruian beast modes which were much more impressive. The Dinobots got the initial jump on Shockwave, as their attack was too illogical for him to understand, but he quickly recovered and dispatched the entire team, destroying their synthetic skins and sending them into stasis lock. Grimlock got the final laugh, as the Dinobot ship fired a pre-programmed blast into the surrounding volcanoes to unleash a flow of lava that engulfs all six Transformers until they were uncovered by human paleontologists in 2006.\n\nFollowing this, Skywatch, a government agency who knew about Transformers, took over the site. Later, following escalating Transformer activity on Earth (as seen in \"\"), and losing control of their other captive Transformers Ravage and Laserbeak, Skywatch reactivated Grimlock as a response. The reawakening was sabotaged by the Machination, and Grimlock escaped. He met Scorponok, who proposed an alliance as they were both now fugitives. Grimlock refused, but lost the subsequent battle, teleporting himself to the Dinobot ship. Vowing to bring down Scorponok, he was unaware the Machination were manipulating Skywatch into reactivating the other Dinobots, with the aim of having them dispose of Grimlock (\"\").\n\nFollowing their acquisition of the Transformers licence in 2005 IDW Publishing released a comic book series which takes place during the \"Beast Wars\" animated series, but features the toys and characters who did not appear in the show itself. The \"Beast Wars\" incarnation of Grimlock appeared, as a gigantic white \"Velociraptor\"-type dinosaur, and it was revealed that Grimlock was among those in protoform stasis on the Axalon, and like the others was launched into space in the series pilot. He fought against Predacon leader Magmatron in a one-on-one battle but lost the upper hand when Magmatron split into three separate beast forms, which attacked him simultaneously; in the long run however, he provided the necessary distraction for the Maximals to steal Magmatron's Chronal Phase armband, leading to his ultimate defeat. Grimlock has since joined Razorbeast's Maximal team. After the defeat of Magmatron's Predacons the united group of Maximals awaited rescue from Cybertron.\n\nHe appears among the Maximals on the cover of the first issue of the sequel story \"Beast Wars: The Ascending\". In the beginning of \"Beast Wars The Ascending\" Razorbeast speaks to Prowl and Wolfang about how he feels there is no rescue mission coming for them from Cybertron as Grimlock hunts in the nearby woods. In \"Beast Wars: The Ascending\" #4 Grimlock was among the Maximals and Predacons returned to Cybertron to battle Shokaract.\n\nGrimlock had a biography printed in the \"Beast Wars Sourcebook\" by IDW Publishing.\n\nGrimlock also features briefly in the comic story \"Dawn of the Predacus\" in which his exposure to transmatter turns him into a protoform, heralding his eventual role in \"Beast Wars\" fiction. As he is placed in a stasis pod he is looked upon by Predacon-and future Maximal-Dinobot, possibly indicating where the warrior took his future name.\n\nIn the Japanese manga \"Big War\" #2, the Autobots Rodimus Prime, Grimlock, Kup and Wheelie, along with their human allies Spike Witwicky and Daniel Witwicky send Computron into battle against Galvatron's new warrior combiner Abominus. The Terrorcons spit \"corrosive control liquid\" against Computron, taking control of him and turning him into a Decepticon. Spike luckily uses his new Exosuit to free Computron with \"defense spray\". Defeated, Galvatron retreats.\n\nSince Marvel Comics' \"Transformers\" series were primarily written by Bob Budiansky in its early years, the writer was able to present his origin for the Dinobots as he had originally conceived it. Hence, when the Ark crashed on Earth four million years ago, it was followed down to the planet by the Decepticon Shockwave, who touched down in the prehistoric region of Antarctica known as the Savage Land. The Ark's computer detected his presence on the planet, and its scans of the Savage Land led it to believe that dinosaurs were the dominant life form. Thus, it reconstructed Grimlock and his troops into dinosaur forms, in order to battle Shockwave. Unfortunately, he slyly outmaneuvered them and managed to pick them off at a distance with his superior firepower; knocking them into a tar pit one by one. With their final strike the battle ended in a stalemate as the Dinobots made him fall in the pit along with them, buried under a rock slide for several million years.\n\nIn 1984, when Shockwave was accidentally reactivated by an Autobot probe and took command of the Decepticons from Megatron, Autobot medic Ratchet entered into an uneasy alliance with the deposed Decepticon leader, agreeing to recover the Dinobots so that they might defeat Shockwave again. Ratchet pulled a double-cross, however, and had the Dinobots attack Megatron instead, resulting in a battle that ended with Megatron's disappearance.\n\nGrimlock steadily grew more and more displeased with Optimus Prime's leadership, and eventually broke his Dinobots away from the main Autobot faction. After a prolonged period living in self-imposed exile, the news of Optimus Prime's death brought Grimlock back to the Autobots. After proving his worth by defeating the Decepticon Trypticon, Grimlock was elected leader of the Autobots.\n\nIt soon proved that people with power, especially a lot of power, are more likely to be corrupt. Grimlock became a tyrannical ruler who led the Autobots with an iron fist. His policy towards Earth and its inhabitants were vastly different from Optimus Prime's – instead of viewing them as objects of protection, Grimlock expressed a disdain for humanity, viewing them as an inferior species unworthy of their protection. Under Grimlock's leadership, the Ark was repaired and made space-worthy again.\n\nIn issue #32, titled \"Used Autobots\", Wheeljack completed work on his Geothermal Generator, which used the heat from the volcano the Ark had crashed in to generate energon cubes. Although Wheeljack thought this would impress Grimlock by reducing their dependence on human help, Grimlock seemed to think the Autobots should just take what they need from the humans.\n\nBlaster and Goldbug could not endure Grimlock's leadership any more, and set out on their own, only to have Grimlock mark them as traitors. Blaster was hunted down by the Protectobots and later the Dinobots themselves, and placed under imprisonment and torture.\n\nWhen the Autobot Headmasters and Targetmasters arrived from Nebulos, Grimlock refused to recognize the authority of Fortress Maximus and failed to establish an allegiance with his group. This proved to be the last straw for the Autobots under Grimlock's command, who collectively conspired to overthrow him, arranging for Blaster to challenge Grimlock for leadership. During their battle on the moon, the Decepticons took advantage of this weakness in the Autobot ranks and interrupted the duel with an all-out assault. With all Autobots now under attack from their mortal enemies, Grimlock and Blaster put their differences aside and fought alongside each other against the Decepticon horde. Subsequently, Fortress Maximus orchestrated the recreation of Optimus Prime as a Powermaster, and Grimlock stepped down as leader.\n\nGrimlock and the Dinobots were destroyed during the battle against Starscream while the villain was super-powered by the Underbase.\n\nGrimlock was seen among the Autobots being repaired on the Ark when Optimus Prime sent Landmine and Cloudburst on their mission to obtain computer chips to repair fellow Autobots in issue #52, \"Guess Who The Mechannibals Are Having For Dinner?\"\n\nGrimlock's body was seen among the deactivated Autobots Ratchet was doing his best to revive in Transformers #56, \"Back from the Dead\".\n\nAfter a short time, Grimlock (along with Jazz and Bumblebee) was rebuilt by Ratchet as a Pretender. Ratchet shortly after was lost in a transport incident while taking out Megatron, and was thus unable to continue his work restoring other Autobots in stasis lock (Ratchet later returned, physically merged with Megatron). Grimlock swore to one day find a way to revive his Dinobots.\n\nUnder the leadership of Powermaster Optimus Prime, Grimlock proved to be a loyal and powerful Autobot, daring even to battle the Matrix-powered Decepticon Thunderwing during the Matrix Quest. However, he was still obsessed with quickly reviving the Dinobots, a goal which put him at odds with Optimus Prime, who advocated patience in the search for a way to rebuild the fallen Autobots. Grimlock finally lost patience, stole the bodies of the Dinobots and a shuttle from the Ark, and piloted it to the planet Hydrus Four, where scientists had developed a new fuel called nucleon. It was more powerful than energon and capable of bringing dead Transformers back to life, but it was unstable and could have unforeseen consequences. Grimlock was unwilling to subject his Dinobots to anything he would not go through himself, and thus decided to test the fuel on himself first. When no ill effects were apparent, he used it to revive the Dinobots, and brought enough back to revive the remaining fallen Autobots.\n\nThe Dinobots returned to Cybertron with the nucleon, and arrived in time for the battle with Unicron. Their arrival, and their reviving the fallen Autobots with Nucleon, was an important part of Transformer victory that day, but Optimus Prime once again lost his life, sacrificing himself to destroy Unicron, and once again naming Grimlock as his successor with his dying breath.\n\nBefore Grimlock could celebrate his new position, however, the Nucleon's effect on Transformers became apparent. Grimlock began to experience brief bursts of immobility, his joints locking, which reached a peak when he became completely paralyzed in Cybertron's wastelands while he and the Dinobots were under attack by monstrous creatures from beneath Cybertron's surface. Realizing that Grimlock had become trapped in a \"chrysalis\" stage, Prime's Powermaster partner, Hi-Q, tapped into and accelerated the process, completing Grimlock's evolution into a more powerful \"Actionmaster\" – but the enhanced power came with a price: Grimlock was now no longer able to transform into dinosaur mode.\n\nAt that point, Cybertron was believed to be dying as a result of the battle with Unicron, and the Autobots and Decepticons were co-operating to evacuate. However, the Decepticons had a hidden motive: to escape, and leave the Autobots marooned on the dying planet. Grimlock and the Dinobots were the only ones among the Autobots who saw through the Decepticons' false pretense of peaceful co-existence and suspected the plan of mass betrayal. When the Decepticons sabotaged the Autobots' ships and fled the planet, Grimlock saved the Autobots. He revealed that he had captured Decepticon ships after a strike against them before the voyage to Earth, and had hidden them away. Thanks to those ships, the Autobots were able to flee Cybertron and follow the Decepticons to the planet Klo for a final showdown. Unfortunately Decepticon leader Bludgeon had discovered the Autobot homing beacon and laid a trap for them. Grimlock's stubbornness meant the Autobots walked right into it, decimating them. Grimlock was one of the few survivors, and when Optimus Prime returned, recreated by the Last Autobot, Grimlock participated in the rout of the Decepticons.\n\nWhile the monthly \"Transformers\" comic was published in the United States, its sister title in the United Kingdom reprinted its stories, and included many of its own original tales, interspliced with the running American narrative. The author of these stories, Simon Furman, was particularly fond of Grimlock, often using him for his original stories, and even using the character for responses on the readers' letters page. Furman truly transformed Grimlock, from the brutish tyrant of the early American comics into a noble anti-hero.\n\nSet in and around the U.S. stories, Grimlock and the Dinobots were the stars of several stories while self-exiled from the other Autobots, including \"In The National Interest\" where they tried to help expose the Robo-Master hoax. When leader of the Autobots, Grimlock was involved in assisting Action Force battle Megatron in London and attempted to kill the Predacon Divebomb in order to silence embarrassing facts about Swoop's past.\n\nTowards the end of the series, the UK comics began a break-away storyline that branched off from the continuity of the American stories, beginning with Grimlock's decision to once again break his Dinobots away from the main Autobot force. Tired of Prime's pacifistic approach to protecting Earth, Grimlock was joined by several older Autobots like Prowl and Wheeljack, who had just recently been reactivated, and longed for the older, simpler days. Under Grimlock's command, they formed the Earthforce, a pro-active Autobot group based in Canada who regularly battled the two Decepticon forces under the commands of Megatron and Shockwave.\n\nIssue #279 of the Marvel U.K. Transformers comic featured a story called \"Divide and Conquer!\" where Soundwave lead the bulk of the Decepticon forces on Earth against the Autobot Earthforce headquarters while Starscream attacked an oil tanker. Sent into battle by Prowl, the Dinobots routed the main Decepticon forces while Springer lead the Autobot Survivors, Broadside, Inferno, Skids, and Carnivac to defeat Starscream.\n\nThere was no specific ending for the Earthforce crew, but the issue of nucleon was resolved in a one-shot text story contained in the final \"Transformers\" annual (a hardback book containing new material released each year). Of the Dinobots, only Slag retained the ability to transform, until the discovery of new nucleon allowed all the Transformers previously empowered by it to regain their transforming abilities. The place in continuity of this tale is hard to determine. It followed on from the events at the conclusion of the American series, yet cannot fit in with American continuity as it puts Megatron in a situation he cannot possibly be in.\n\nA few years after the conclusion of the original \"Transformers\" comic, the line was given a shot in the arm with the release of the new \"\" toyline and an accompanying comic. Grimlock's toy was re-released for the \"G2\" toyline in several colors including blue, but he continued to appear in his original grey color scheme for most of his appearances in the \"G2\" comic.\n\nWith his transformation capabilities restored (the explanation for which was not offered in the American series), Grimlock was Optimus Prime's second in command in the so-called \"Generation 2\" series, aiding in the Autobots' war against the \"second generation\" of Cybertronians led by Jhiaxus. However, he remained as rebellious and aggressive as ever, though it proved to be a mixed blessing - at one point his urge to combat Jhiaxus's forces led him and his troops right into a trap, while at another time, his willingness to defy Optimus Prime's orders and launch an all-out attack saved Prime from certain death at the hands of Megatron. When the Autobots and Decepticons united against Jhiaxus and the threat of the Swarm - a destructive by-product of Transformer reproduction - Grimlock was the joint leader of the ground troops as Prime and Megatron fought on other fronts, and survived the brutal conflict.\n\nGrimlock appeared in his blue Generation 2 form in the short lived UK. Generation 2 comic series.\n\nGrimlock appears in the TFcon 2008 voice play prelude comic called \"Ground Effects\" where Perceptor informs him about a repeat repeat wave. Grimlock orders the other Dinobots to dig up a Transformer on Dinobot Island.\n\nGrimlock appeared in the TFcon 2008 voice play \"Primitive Recall.\"\n\nThe Classic line appeared in a simple Flash-based video game on the Hasbro web site called \"Transformers Battle Circuit\". In this one-on-one fighting game you press the right and left arrow keys to try to overpower your opponent. In the game you can play Rodimus, Bumblebee, Grimlock, Jetfire, Starscream, Astrotrain, Trypticon or Menasor. Optimus Prime and Megatron each appear as the boss you must defeat to win the game.\n\nGrimlock is featured in the webcomic Twisted Kaiju Theater.\n\nGrimlock appears as a play on the word gridlock in the popular webcomic Least I Could Do.\n\nGrimlock will be portrayed as Hal the Boomerang Bird in Angry Birds Transformers. This version is not a humanoid who can change into a tyrannosaurus, but rather is a Tyrannosaurus who can change into a motorcycle.\n\n\nOptimus Prime, Ironhide and Grimlock are the three Autobot figures available to play in the Monopoly Transformers Collectors Edition game.\n\nThe first completely different character to bear the name of Grimlock was one inhabiting the alternate universe of the 2001 \"Transformers\" toyline, \"\". Grimlock is a 1:60 scale toy.\n\nGrimlock (originally named Build Hurricane in the original Japanese version of the series, \"Car Robots\") was a co-leader of the Autobot Build Team, able to transform into a steam shovel. Despite his harsh appearance, Grimlock is a seasoned, upbeat warrior. He judges any situation in a composed, calm manner, and dispenses accurate advice based on his many past experiences in battle to others, particularly his leader, Wedge. He can combine with his fellow Build Team members to create Landfill, able to form either a leg or a pair of arms.\n\nGrimlock first appeared in episode #18 \"Wedge's Short Fuse\" and last appeared in episode #38 \"The Final Battle Part 2\".\n\nRobots in Disguise Grimlock (in Walmart yellow repaint colors) appeared in the 2004 BotCon voice actor play.\n\n\"Play Synopsis\": Rhinox has built a device to deflect Unicron's attempts to pull victims from other dimensions with his tractor beam. The Autobots deflect two attempts and the victims end up on a frozen planetoid instead of with Unicron. Maximals Rattrap and Silverbolt and the Predacon Waspinator are sent to help the victims, but Reptilion, Sunstorm, Ruination, and \"Universe\" Perceptor are sent to get them for Unicron. As a side effect of the device Rhinox built, a vortex opens which sucks in an Autobot shuttle from the past piloted by Bumblebee, Tracks, and Cosmos. Thrust attacks the Maximal ship, but they are saved by being transported to the Autobot shuttle. The Autobots and Maximals then go to the planet where they save the victims from the Decepticons. On the planet are two groups of Autobots. One is from the \"Robots in Disguise\" story, with Landfill (Walmart recolor), \"Universe\" Side Burn, and \"Universe\" Prowl. The other is from another parallel world with Spy Changer Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Prowl, and Ironhide. They all fight off the Decepticons. The Autobot shuttle is sent back to its own time.\n\n\nAnother alternate-universe incarnation of Grimlock entered the fray in the Transformers: Energon line. Grimlock's toy – packaged with the similarly-redesigned Swoop – was a modern updating of his original figure. It still transformed into a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", but had one major change: Grimlock and Swoop could now combine to form a larger robot named \"Mega-Dinobot\". The characters' joint biography clearly draws on the Generation 1 cartoon incarnation of the original characters, presenting them as Autobots who are simple in speech and thought, but who make up for it in raw strength. Decepticons have been known to flee in fear when faced with the two Dinobots, as Swoop uses his aerial abilities to confuse and distract them, while Grimlock attacks from behind and stomps them flat before they know what hit them. Though heavily armed, the duo's preferred weaponry is their teeth and talons.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that longtime Grimlock fan Simon Furman intended to feature the characters in Dreamwave's \"Energon\" comic book, but the company's closure prevented this.\n\nGrimlock appeared in the text story from Fun Publications called \"Force of Habit\". This story explained where he was during the events of the \"Cybertron\" story. Ultra Magnus was the commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search for the Cyber Planet Keys. He also served as captain of the \"Iron Hope\" which was crewed by Bonecrusher, Grimlock, Ironhide, Knock Out, Overcast, Prowl, Quickstrike, RipTide, Skyblast, Smokescreen, Swoop, Wreckage, and the Sky Scorcher Mini-Con Team. Grimlock and Swoop were sent to stop an attack by Predacon on the ship.\n\n\nProducer Tom DeSanto has stated that he had an idea on how to include the Dinobots and Constructicons in a possible sequel, although director Michael Bay has confirmed that they will not be. However, the Constructicons and their combined form, Devastator, do appear in the 2009 movie.\n\nIn a \"USA Today\" online fan poll, Grimlock was one of the 10 Transformers that the fans wanted in the sequel, tied for second with 16% of the votes.\n\nLater reports revealed that Grimlock and other Dinobots would be featured in the fourth film, with images surfacing of Optimus Prime riding Grimlock into battle in Hong Kong.\n\nIn \"\", Grimlock and the Dinobots are captured by Lockdown as trophies, referred to as legendary knights. After the Autobots escape with the part of the ship holding them, Optimus releases the Dinobots for backup and engages in a battle for dominance with Grimlock which Optimus wins. Submitting to Optimus, Grimlock allows Optimus to ride him into battle in Hong Kong and aids in destroying the KSI Decepticons and protecting the Seed. After Lockdown is defeated, Optimus releases Grimlock and the Dinobots to go their own way. This Grimlock is larger than previous incarnations and, like the rest of the Dinobots, he isn't referred to by name (although in The Last Knight he is named by Cade Yeager) as he cannot speak, or at least has yet to learn how.\n\nGrimlock returned in \"\". Grimlock is among the Autobots taking sanctuary at Cade Yeager's junkyard. He has taken up the personality of a dog, often eating the local police chief's car. During the TRF and Decepticon invasion of the junkyard, Grimlock attacks a fleet of TRF cars along with Slug, eating the Decepticon Dreadbot. Though he is not seen after this, Grimlock presumably joins the other Autobots in returning to Cybertron on Lockdown's ship.\n\nMini-Grimlock, a baby Dinobot, also appears in \"the Last Knight\", as one of the Autobots in Cade's junkyard. It gains Grimlock's fire breath, which it uses in Cade's trailer. Mini-Grimlock is seen snuggling with Izabella and around the other Autobots.\n\nThe Sector 7 viral marketing web site featured several videos recording supposed evidence of Transformers on Earth. These featured cameos by Generation 1 Transformers, including scenes of Grimlock destroying a construction site, as well as scenes of Kickback and Laserbeak being video taped by people accidentally, and a security video showing bits of a robot looking a lot like Generation 1 Bumblebee transforming in a parking garage.\n\nGrimlock's \"Age of Extinction\" incarnation is a playable character in \"\". In the game, he controls very identical to his counterpart in .\n\nGrimlock is one of the main playable characters in , and the only one who does not transform into a motor vehicle.\n\n\nA character named Grimlock appears in \"\", which began airing in 2007. He is similar to his animated Generation 1 incarnation in persona and form, but with his face modified with a feral look. His beast mode now looks more like how an actual \"Tyrannosaurus\" is thought to look and his roar sounds much like the \"T. Rexs roar from \"Jurassic Park\". In robot mode, he wields a flaming battle sword and can breathe fire in beast mode. Grimlock is partnered with fellow Dinobots, Snarl and Swoop. He debuts in episode 6, \"Blast From the Past\". Grimlock acquired his name while the damaged Megatron's head was surveying the Dinobots at Prof. Isaac Sumdac's laboratory. Megatron said, \"And without more substantial robotics for my own body, my prospects are grim, lock\"'ed in this prison of a lab.\" He is also the only one of the Dinobots to talk and the first to transform into robot mode.\n\nIn \"Blast From the Past\" the Autobots visit a dinosaur-themed amusement park where animatronic dinosaurs are on display, but Bulkhead accidentally breaks them. Professor Sumdac and Megatron rebuild the animatronic dinosaurs as technological wonders named the Dinobots, who go on a rampage under the Deception's influence until the attacks powered Sari's AllSpark key affecting Bumblebee and Ratchet's Electromagnetic blast against the Dinobots by making them conscious. Finding a way to control them, Megatron told Grimlock to attack the city by telling the Dinobots they are \"fossil feeders\" due to the way Earth vehicles are powered and that the Autobots are even worse. The Dinobots are lured away by the Autobots, with Prowl secretly placing them at the later named Dinobot Island in hopes that they'll live in peace. However, while expressing his rage at two birds defecating on him, Grimlock accidentally transforms to robot mode and finds his new form to his liking.\n\nIn a TFA short, \"Bulkhead Plays with Grimlock\", Bulkhead throws a tree for no reason. Then Grimlock catches it with his mouth, and brings it back to Bulkhead. Grimlock states he loves fetch and asks to play again. Apparently this is a contradiction to \"Human Error Part 2\" where he criticized Snarl for willing to become a pet to Scrapper.\n\nThe episode \"Survival of the Fittest\" marks his, as well as the rest of the Dinobots, official side change when they help defeat Meltdown, Cyrus \"The Colossus\" Rhodes, and Meltdown's experiments.\n\nIn \"Megatron Rising\" Pt. 1, Optimus Prime, Prowl, and Bulkhead try to get the Dinobots to help them fight the Decepticons, but they refused saying that robots are their enemies. Upon them being told that they are robots too, Grimlock and the other two Dinobots end up fighting each other.\n\nIn \"The Elite Guard\", Optimus Prime leads Ultra Magnus and Sentinel Prime to the downed ship on Dinobot Island when they run into Grimlock and the Dinobots. Despite Optimus' warnings, Sentinel Prime charged them and got defeated. Ultra Magnus repelled them with the lightning he summoned with his hammer.\n\nIn \"A Fistful of Energon\", Prowl and Bulkhead are sent to the island where the Dinobots are, once again, to investigate the reports of a rampage. Soon enough, Grimlock heads right towards Prowl and Bulkhead, thinking something has made him hostile, but later discovering something is wedged between his foot, and yank it out.\n\nLater, under Blackarachnia's seduction, Grimlock returns in the episode \"Black Friday\" to break out Meltdown. Out of the Dinobots, Grimlock had the most love for Blackarachnia, refusing to accept that she's using him when she departs, leaving him heartbroken.\n\nIn \"Predacons Rising\" the Dinobots are once again coerced into doing Blackarachnia's bidding, bringing them into conflict with the Autobots. In the ensuing battle, they are overwhelmed and defeated by and Jetstorm, though Jetfire noted Grimlock seemed to have some fight left in him.\n\nDuring the \"Human Error\" 2-parter, Sari attempted to get the Dinobots' aid only to have a not so warm welcome. Though she managed to convince him not to attack with her techno-organic powers, Grimlock refuses to give the Autobots aid; however, he indirectly led her in looking for Snarl, whom he lost respect towards and considered a 'traitor' for befriending the marooned Scrapper.\n\nGrimlock appears among the characters in \"Re-Unification\", the 2010 TFCon voice actor play prelude comic.\n\n\nThis Grimlock is an evil version of the \"Generation 1\" character. It should also be noted that this Grimlock has Trypticon's colors.\n\nAccording to the Tech Specs Grimlock was created as an experiment in artificial intelligence by the Decepticons which became too violent and Megatron shut him down. Optimus Prime then liberated Grimlock and let him work for the Autobots.\n\nInitially Grimlock is a non-living machine without the ability to transform to a humanoid shape. Once granted an ember by the Omega Terminus he gains the ability to transform. His transformation seems to be tied to his emotions. When calm intellectual he gains a humanoid mode, but when enraged he is forced into dinosaur mode. Grimlock was reprogrammed by Optimus Prime to not be able to attack anything bearing the purple Autobot symbol, but after being granted an ember he seems to have overcome this limitation.\n\nThe Botcon 2008 set was chosen as the \"Action Figure Digest Hot Pick.\"\n\nGrimlock appears in the 2008 April Fool's comic \"Shattered Expectations\" by Fun Publications.\n\nGrimlock appears as a member of Optimus Prime's forces in the \"Transformers: Timelines\" story \"Shattered Glass\". He helps defend the Ark from a Decepticon attack, but is overcome by the Predacons.\n\nGrimlock appears in the preview to \"Dungeons & Dinobots\", printed in the Transformers Collectors Club magazine issue #22. Huffer attempts to capture Grimlock, but Grimlock chases him away while following a strange voice into the depths of Cybertron.\n\nGrimlock appears in the text fiction \"Dungeons & Dinobots\". The mad Autobot scientist Wheeljack duplicates Grimlock's design to create an army of Dinobots, which he uses to attack the Decepticons, but sadly the dinobots attack each other in the frenzy of their first battle. Grimlock runs off, being called to the super computer known as the Omega Terminus, Grimlock is granted an ember, superior intelligence and the ability to transform. Followed by the Rodimus, Blurr, Cliffjumper and Sideswipe, he confronts the four with the aid of an army of zombie mechs, including the reanimated bodies of the dead Cliffjumper from his world and Sideswipe's old leader Drench. He bites the left hand off Rodimus during the battle, but thrown off a cliff during the fight. Although presumed dead he appears at the Autobot headquarters offering his services to Optimus Prime of his own free will, secretly planning on helping grant embers the various Dinobots and Dinocons.\n\nIn \"Do Over\" it is revealed that Grimlock had given the Dinobots and Dinocons embers, then returned them to the Autobots and Decepticons.\n\nIn \"Reunification\" Grimlock is seen gnawing on the body of Blurr, who was punished by Optimus Prime for failing to stop Rodimus from taking the \"Ark\".\n\n\nGrimlock is known for not following orders or trusting in Optimus Prime's ability to be an effective leader. As the leader of the Lightning Strike Coalition Force, Grimlock enjoys smashing things first and asking questions later. Due to Shockwave's experiments, Grimlock has been left with a malfunctioning voice processor and alt-mode inspired by a distant primitive world.\n\nGrimlock is part of Bumblebee's new team of Autobots in \"\", though his personality is much different then what was seen in \"Fall of Cybertron\" and the \"Aligned\" Continuity Comics, and his character's history seems to apply that this is a different character. Coincidentally, this incarnation also sports green colors similar to the 2001's incarnation from the series also titled \"\". He also speaks properly unlike previous incarnations. It is later revealed by one of the show's producers that there is more than one Grimlock in this continuity.\n\nIn \"\", as one of many Decepticon prisoners aboard the Autobot ship \"Alchemor\", Grimlock was the only one not to escape when the vessel crashed on Earth. The stasis unit on his cell was damaged however, and he was thus awake when the Autobots were engaging his former fellow inmate Underbite in the first pilot episode. He was freed after he insulted Underbite, and subsequently engaged the Decepticon in battle to satisfy his destructive impulses. Grimlock then proved an unlikely addition to Bumblebee's team, and with them witnessed the astonishing reappearance of Optimus Prime. After Underbite was imprisoned, Bumblebee decided to allow Grimlock to join the team on probation, and thus has been a major character in the series since. Later, after bringing the cyber-tick Minitron, he was formally inducted into the Autobot ranks and began to sport Autobot symbols instead of the Decepticon ones he sported in all of the episodes prior. According to Bumblebee, the only reason Grimlock was imprisoned on the \"Alchemor\" was due to severe property damage, which Bumblebee deemed to just be him acting like himself and not being a threat. Some major changes from previous Grimlock incarnations is that along with not having a speech impediment that was shown in series prior, he also has a much more mild manner and a showingly kind personality, though he usually is shown as not the most intellectual character on the team.\n\nGrimlock appears in the \"Transformers: Prime\" spinoff comic series, \"Rage of the Dinobots\", in which he and the other Dinobots remain behind on Cybertron after Optimus Prime departs. Grimlock becomes the leader of a city known as Last Spark, ruling over and protecting the citizens in a monarchial fashion. He and the other Dinobots are forced to contend with the prejudices of other Cybertronians due to their altered states, as well as Shockwave's creations, which include a group of Decepticons known as the Forged.\n\nGrimlock appears as a minor character in the portable version of \"\"\n\nGrimlock is one of the main characters of subject in the 2012 game \"\", where he and his team are captured by Shockwave and the Insecticons and taken to a laboratory where Shockwave transforms them into the Dinobots. Grimlock becomes the first to break free following a brief encounter with the disgraced Starscream and proceeds to free three of four (Sludge having been put in stasis lock and left behind after they were captured) other members of his team, discover his Dinobot abilities, and destroy the space bridge Megatron plans to use as a route to a perpetual energy source, Earth.\n\n\nGrimlock is one of the characters who is set to appear in \"\".\n"}

{"id": "1075817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1075817", "title": "Jean-Gaspard Deburau", "text": "Jean-Gaspard Deburau\n\nJean-Gaspard Deburau (born Jan Kašpar Dvořák; July 31, 1796 – June 17, 1846), sometimes erroneously called Debureau, was a celebrated Bohemian-French mime. He performed from 1816 to the year of his death at the Théâtre des Funambules, which was immortalized in Marcel Carné's poetic-realist film \"Children of Paradise\" (1945); Deburau appears in the film (under his stage-name, \"Baptiste\") as a major character. His most famous pantomimic creation was Pierrot—a character that served as the godfather of all the Pierrots of Romantic, Decadent, Symbolist, and early Modernist theater and art.\n\nBorn in Kolín, Bohemia (now Czech Republic), Deburau was the son of a Czech servant, Kateřina Králová (or Catherine Graff), and a former French soldier, Philippe-Germain Deburau, a native of Amiens. Some time before 1814, when he appeared in Paris, Philippe had turned showman, and had begun performing at the head of a nomadic troupe probably made up, at least in part, of his own children. When the company was hired, in 1816, by the manager of the Funambules for mimed and acrobatic acts, the young Deburau was included in the transaction.\n\nApparently, as cast-lists indicate, he began appearing as Pierrot as early as the year of his hiring, although it was not until 1825 that he became the sole actor to claim the role. His \"discovery\" by the theater-savvy public did not occur until several years later, when, in 1828, the influential writer Charles Nodier published a panegyric on his art in \"La Pandore\". Nodier persuaded his friends, fellow men-of-letters, to visit the theater; the journalist Jules Janin published a book of effusive praise, entitled \"Deburau, histoire du Théâtre à Quatre Sous\", in 1832; and by the middle of the 1830s Deburau was known to \"tout Paris\". Théophile Gautier wrote of his talent with enthusiasm (\"the most perfect actor who ever lived\"); Théodore de Banville dedicated poems and sketches to his Pierrot; Charles Baudelaire alluded to his style of acting as a way of understanding \"The Essence of Laughter\" (1855).\n\nHe seems to have been almost universally loved by his public, which included the high and the low, both the Romantic poets of the day and the working-class \"children of paradise\", who installed themselves regularly in the cheapest seats (which were also the highest: the \"paradise\") of the house. It was before this public of artists and artisans that he found himself in his only true element: when, in 1832, he took his pantomime to the Palais-Royal, he failed spectacularly. The occasion was a benefit performance of a pantomime performed earlier—with great success—at the Funambules, and included actors, not only from the Funambules, but also from the Gymnase, the Opéra, and the bastion of high dramatic art, the Théâtre-Français. Louis Péricaud, the chronicler of the Funambules, wrote that \"never was there a greater disaster, a rout more complete for Deburau and his fellow-artists.\" Deburau himself was hissed, and he vowed to play thereafter before no other public than those \"naïfs and enthusiasts\" who were habitués of the Boulevard du Crime.\nBut some of that public, however admiring, made the mistake of confusing his creation with his character, and one day in 1836, as he was out strolling with his family, he was taunted as a \"Pierrot\" by a street-boy, with ugly consequences: the boy died from one blow of his heavy cane. Deburau's biographer, Tristan Rémy, contends that the incident throws into relief the darker side of his art. \"The bottle\", Rémy writes, \"whose label 'Laudanum' he smilingly revealed after Cassander had drained it, the back of the razor he passed over the old man's neck, were toys which he could not be allowed to take seriously and thus put to the test his patience, his reserve, his sang-froid.\" And Rémy concludes: \"When he powdered his face, his nature, in fact, took the upper hand. He stood then at the measure of his life—bitter, vindictive, and unhappy.\"\n\nIn court, he was acquitted of murder. Carné remarked, \"There ensued a trial which \"le tout Paris\" crowded into, in order to get to hear the voice of the famed Debureau .\" The composer Michel Chion named this curiosity about a voice the \"Deburau effect\". The idea of a Deburau effect has been extended to any drawing of the listener's attention to an inaudible sound—which, once heard, loses its interest.\n\nWhen he died, his son Jean-Charles (1829–1873) took over his role and later founded a \"school\" of pantomime, which flourished in the south of France, then, at the end of the century, in the capital. A line can be drawn from that school to the Bip of Marcel Marceau.\n\nJean-Gaspard Deburau is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\n\nIn a review of a pantomime at the Funambules after Deburau's death, Gautier reproached the mime's successor, Paul Legrand, for dressing \"half as a comic-opera Colin, half as a Tyrolean hunter\", thereby degrading the Pierrot of Baptiste. He was answered by a letter from the Funambules' director, who wished to disabuse the poet of his \"error\": \" ... we have some thirty-odd plays performed by Debureau in different costumes, and Paul has simply continued the practice ... \". Pierrot was not Baptiste's only creation. As Robert Storey, one of the most assiduous students of the mime's repertoire, has pointed out, Deburau performed in many pantomimes unconnected with the Commedia dell'Arte:\nHe was probably the student-sailor Blanchotin in \"Jack, l'orang-outang\" (1836), for example, and the farmhand Cruchon in \"Le Tonnelier et le somnambule\" ([The Cooper and the Sleepwalker] late 1838 or early 1839), and the goatherd Mazarillo in \"Fra-Diavolo, ou les Brigands de la Calabre\" ([Brother Devil, or The Brigands of Calabria] 1844). He was certainly the -like \"comique\" of \"Hurluberlu\" (1842) and the engagingly naïve recruit Pichonnot of \"Les Jolis Soldats\" ([The Handsome Soldiers] 1843).\nLike Chaplin's various incarnations, all of whom bear some resemblance to the Little Tramp, these characters, though singular and independent creations, must undoubtedly have struck their audiences as Pierrot-like. For Deburau and Pierrot were synonymous in the Paris of post-Revolutionary France.\n\nThe Pierrot of his predecessors at the Funambules—and that of their predecessors at the Foires St.-Germain and St.-Laurent of the previous century—had been quite different from the character that Deburau eventually devised. He had been at once more aggressive in his acrobatics (his \"superabundance\", in Péricaud's words, \"of gestures, of leaps\") than Baptiste's \"placid\" creation, and much less aggressive in his audacity and daring. The Pierrot of \"Saphir the Enchanter, Pantomime in 3 Parts\" (1817) is a typical pre-Deburau type. Lazy and sexless, he much prefers stuffing his gut to the amorous pastimes of Harlequin and Claudine. And when Harlequin's heroics seem on the point of bringing the machinations of the Enchanter to an end, Pierrot's stupid bungling nearly precipitates disaster. Even when he summons up the pluck and resourcefulness to initiate actions of his own, as he does in \"The Pink Genie and the Blue Genie, or The Old Women Rejuvenated\" (1817), he shows—in the Pink Genie's words at the end of the piece—\"only the signs of an unjust and wicked heart\", and so is buried in a cage in the bowels of the earth.\n\nDeburau dispensed with Pierrot's coarseness and emphasized his cleverness. As theater historian Edward Nye writes, \"[George] Sand describes the new Pierrot as if he were a more reflective version of the old, as if Pierrot had somehow intellectually matured and learnt to moderate his worst excesses, or even to turn them into relative virtues.\" So radical was that maturation that the poet Gautier, though a great admirer of the mime, reproached him after his death for having \"denaturalized\" the character. No longer the cowardly stooge, his Pierrot \"gave kicks and no longer received them; Harlequin now scarcely dared brush his shoulders with his bat; Cassander would think twice before boxing his ears.\" Deburau restored to Pierrot some of the force and energy of the earlier Italian type Pedrolino (though he probably never heard of that predecessor). Part of this may have been due to what Rémy calls the vindictiveness of Deburau's own personality; but what seems more likely is that, with the assurance that comes with great talent, Deburau instinctively forged a role with a commanding stage presence.\n\nNye identifies the source of that presence: it arose from the \"semantic clarity\" of Deburau's art. (\"Such was the semantic clarity of his body language that spectators ‘listened’ to him and could translate his mime into words and phrases\".) Nye explains: From the waning world of the commedia dell’arte he took the concept of playing a role, Pierrot, with recurrent characteristics and types of behaviour. ... From the wider world of theatre he took the principle of character acting, of seeking to imitate the physical and psychological manner of social types as realistically as possible. And Nye suggests how these two orders of acting \"contributed to the clarity of his mime\": \"Firstly, the Pierrot tradition primed the spectator to understand Deburau's mime in certain ways. Secondly, Deburau's character acting provided a social and psychological context\", further sharpening the intelligibility of his performance.\n\nThe expressivity of his acting was abetted by his alterations in Pierrot's costume. His overlarge cotton blouse and trousers freed him from the constraints of the woolen dress of his predecessors, and his abandoning the frilled collaret and hat gave prominence to his expressive face. A black skullcap, framing that face, was his only stark adornment.\n\nBut his real innovations came in the pantomime itself. His biographers, as well as the chroniclers of the Funambules, contend that his pantomimes were all alike. The \"naive scenarios\" that \"limited\" his acting, according to his Czech biographer, Jaroslav Švehla, \"did little more than group together and repeat traditional, threadbare, primitive, and in many cases absurd situations and mimic gags (\"cascades\"), insulting to even a slightly refined taste.\" And Adriane Despot, author of \"Jean-Gaspard Deburau and the Pantomime at the Théâtre des Funambules\", agrees: \"most of the pantomimes are essentially the same; they share the atmosphere of light, small-scale, nonsensical adventures enlivened with comic dances, ridiculous battles, and confrontations placed in a domestic or otherwise commonplace setting.\" But Despot was familiar only with a handful of the scenarios, those few in print; by far the greater number, which present a picture of the pantomime rather different from Despot's, are in manuscript in the Archives Nationales de France and in the library of the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques. And Švehla is proceeding along misguided lines by assuming that Deburau \"longed to represent a better character\" than Pierrot: Deburau was apparently proud of his work at the Funambules, characterizing it to George Sand as an \"art\" (see next section below). \"He loved it passionately\", Sand wrote, \"and spoke of it as of a grave thing\".\n\nThe fact is that four distinct kinds of Commedia-related pantomime held the stage at the Funambules, and for each Deburau created a now subtly, now dramatically different Pierrot.\n\nIf the casual theater-goer (from the mid-twentieth century on) knows Deburau at all, it is the Deburau of \"Children of Paradise\". There, through a brilliant interpretation by Jean-Louis Barrault, he emerges, on-stage and off-, as an exemplar of the common people, a tragic long-suffering lover, a friend of the pure and lonely and distant moon. Neither Deburau nor his Pierrot was such a figure. (That figure is much closer to the Pierrot of his successor, Paul Legrand.) But the myth sprang into being very early, simultaneous with the emergence of Deburau's celebrity. It was the product of clever journalism and idealizing romance: Janin's \"Deburau\" first set things in motion. Deburau, he wrote, \"is the people's actor, the people's friend, a windbag, a glutton, a loafer, a rascal, a poker-face, a revolutionary, like the people.\" Théodore de Banville followed suit: \"both mute, attentive, always understanding each other, feeling and dreaming and responding together, Pierrot and the People, united like two twin souls, mingled their ideas, their hopes, their banter, their ideal and subtle gaiety, like two Lyres playing in unison, or like two Rhymes savoring the delight of being similar sounds and of exhaling the same melodious and sonorous voice.\" Indeed, George Sand noted, after Deburau's death, that the \"titis\", the street boys, of the Funambules seemed to regard his Pierrot as their \"model\"; but, earlier, when she had asked Deburau himself what he thought of Janin's conclusions, he had had this to say: \"the effect is of service to my reputation, but all that is not the art, it's not the idea I have of it. It is not true, and the Deburau of M. Janin is not me: he has not understood me.\"\n\nAs for Banville's idealized Pierrot, it is best appreciated if set against the figure that we find in the scenarios themselves. Late in his life, Banville recalled a pantomime he had seen at the Funambules: Pierrot-baker is confronted by two women—\"two old, old women, bald, disheveled, decrepit, with quivering chins, bent towards the earth, leaning upon gnarled sticks, and showing in their sunken eyes the shadows of years gone by, more numerous than the leaves in the woods.\"\n\"Really now! there's no common sense in this!\" exclaimed (in mute speech) the wise baker Pierrot: \"to allow women to come to such a state is unthinkable. So why hasn't anyone noticed they need to be melted down, remade, rebaked anew?\" And immediately, in spite of their protestations, he seized them, laid them both on his shovel, popped them right in the oven, and then stood watch over his baking with faithful care. When the number of desired minutes had elapsed, he took them out—young, beautiful, transformed by brilliant tresses, with snow at their breasts, black diamonds in their eyes, blood-red roses on their lips, dressed in silk, satin, golden veils, adorned with spangles and sequins—and modestly said then to his friends in the house: \"Well now, you see? It's no more difficult than that!\"\nWhat he is remembering is a scene from \"Pierrot Everywhere\": Pierrot has just stolen Columbine from Harlequin, and he, Cassander, and Leander, along with the fiancées of the latter two, have stumbled upon an oven with magical powers. The fiancées have been aged and wizened by Harlequin's magic bat, and the men hope that the oven can restore their youth.\n[Isabelle and Angelique] refuse to enter the oven, finding themselves fine as they are. \"Pierrot brings in Columbine and wants to burn her alive, too, if she continues to resist his advances; she struggles\" [emphasis added]; the two others succeed in thrusting Isabelle and Angelique inside; Pierrot helps them. Meanwhile Harlequin sticks his head up through the emberbox and signals to Columbine to run off with him. Pierrot sees him; Leander pushes the lid down, hard, and sits on top of it. But hardly has he done so when the box sinks into the ground, swallowing him up.\nPierrot tries to put Columbine inside. He opens the oven door; Isabelle and Angelique come out, young and fresh; they are delighted. Isabelle looks for Leander. A moaning comes from the oven. It is Leander, who has been shut up in it, and who emerges half-baked and furious. They clean him up. Meanwhile, Harlequin has come back in; he makes Columbine step down—she was already on the shovel—and seizes Pierrot. The wicked genie appears and helps Harlequin. They pinion the poor Pierrot and are going to throw him into the oven, when a gong announces the [good] fairy. . . .\nDeburau neither idealized nor sentimentalized his Pierrot. His creation was “poor Pierrot”, yes, but not because he was unfairly victimized: his ineptitude tended to baffle his malice, though it never routed it completely. And if Deburau was, in Švehla’s phrase, an actor of “refined taste”, he was also a gleeful inventor, like Mozart (that artist of ultimate refinement), of sexual and scatological fun. Of his pantomimes in general, George Sand wrote that “the poem is buffoonish, the role cavalier, and the situations scabrous.” And Paul de Saint-Victor echoed her words several weeks after Deburau’s death: “Indeed, in plenty of places, the poem of his roles was free, scabrous, almost obscene.” Unfortunately, Banville’s sanitized—even sanctified—Deburau survives, while the scenario of \"Pierrot Everywhere\", like the more overtly scabrous of the Funambules “poems”, lies yellowing in the files of the Archives Nationales de France.\n\nAt one moment in his career, Deburau—quite inadvertently—contributed to his myths. In 1842, a pantomime was performed at the Funambules in which Pierrot meets a shockingly tragic end: at the final curtain of \"The Ol’ Clo’s Man\" (\"Le Marrrchand d'habits!\"), Pierrot dies on stage. It was an unprecedented dénouement and one not to be repeated, at least at Deburau’s theater. (Imagine the Little Tramp expiring at the end of one of Charlie Chaplin’s films.) It was also an anomaly for which his Romantic admirers were responsible. This pantomime had been invented by Théophile Gautier in a “review” that he had published in the \"Revue de Paris\". He conceived it in the “realistic” vein described above: Pierrot, having fallen in love with a duchess, kills an old-clothes man to secure the garments with which to court her. At the wedding, however, \"à la\" the Commander of \"Don Juan\", the ghost of the peddler—the murdering sword protruding from his chest—rises up to dance with the bridegroom. And Pierrot is fatally impaled.\n\nClaiming that he had seen the pantomime at the Funambules, Gautier proceeded to analyze the action in familiarly idealizing terms. “Pierrot,” he wrote, “walking the street in his white blouse, his white trousers, his floured face, preoccupied with vague desires—is he not the symbol of the human heart still white and innocent, tormented by infinite aspirations toward the higher spheres?” And this dreaming creature of vague desires is essentially innocent of criminal intent: “When Pierrot took the sword, he had no other idea than of pulling a little prank!”\n\nThe temptation to use such material, devised by such an illustrious poet, was irresistible to the managers of the Funambules, and the “review” was immediately turned into a pantomime (probably by the administrator of the theater, Cot d'Ordan). It was not a success: it had a seven-night run, a poor showing for one of Baptiste’s productions. If he indeed appeared in the piece—the matter is under dispute—he did so very reluctantly; it was decidedly not his kind of play. It was never revived at the Funambules, and it should have survived as merely a footnote in Deburau's career.\n\nBut like Banville’s deathless prose, it was Gautier’s “review” that survived—and prospered. Gautier’s ex-son-in-law, Catulle Mendès, refashioned it into a pantomime in 1896, and when Sacha Guitry wrote his play \"Deburau\" (1918) he included it as the only specimen of the mime’s art. Carné did the same (if we may exempt the obviously fabricated \"The Palace of Illusions, or Lovers of the Moon\", in which Baptiste appears as a moonstruck, loveless, suicidal Pierrot, an invention of Carné's screenwriter, Jacques Prévert). It stands today, for the nonscholarly public, as the supreme exemplar of Deburau’s pantomime.\n\nAnd what of Deburau and Pierrot-the-friend-of-the-moon? In the many scenarios in manuscript at the Archives Nationales de France, no connection is visible—save in one, and that, like \"The Ol’ Clo’s Man\", is a clear anomaly. Performed in 1844, after Gautier’s “review” had—at least in the minds of the lettered public—renewed the luster of the Funambules, it was obviously written by an aspiring \"auteur\", judging from its literary pedigree. Entitled \"The Three Distaffs\" and inspired by a tale of the Comtesse d’Aulnoy, it finds, at the end of its action, Harlequin, Pierrot, and Leander all trapped underneath the earth. When the good fairy appears, she announces that her powers are now useless in the terrestrial realm:\n. . . it is on the moon that your happiness must be realized. Poor Pierrot . . . it is you who will be entrusted with the leadership of the celestial voyage that we are about to undertake.\nIn none of the other scenarios in the Archives is there mention of the moon.\n\nBut Deburau’s Romantic admirers often made the association. Banville’s poem \"Pierrot\" (1842) concludes with these lines: “The white Moon with its horns like a bull/Peeps behind the scenes/At its friend Jean Gaspard Deburau.” And as the century progressed, the association—rendered inevitable by the universal familiarity of “Au clair de la lune”—became ever more strong. With the advent of the Symbolist poets, and their intoxication with everything white (and pure: swans, lilies, snow, moons, Pierrots), the legendary star of the Funambules and what Jules Laforgue called Our Lady the Moon became inseparable. Albert Giraud's \"Pierrot lunaire\" (1884) marked a watershed in the moon-maddening of Pierrot, as did the song-cycle that Arnold Schoenberg derived from it (1912). If Carné’s hero had not been moonstruck, his audiences would still be wondering why.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1846395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846395", "title": "Jungle Cruise", "text": "Jungle Cruise\n\nThe Jungle Cruise is a river boat attraction located in Adventureland at many Disney Parks worldwide, namely Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland (the attraction at Hong Kong Disneyland is named \"Jungle River Cruise\"). Disneyland Paris and Shanghai Disneyland are the only Magic Kingdom-style Disney parks that do not have the Jungle Cruise in their attraction rosters.\n\nThe attraction simulates a riverboat cruise down several major rivers of Asia, Africa and South America. Park guests board replica tramp steamers from a 1930s British explorers' lodge and are taken on a voyage past many different Audio-Animatronic jungle animals. The tour is led by a live Disney Cast Member delivering humorous narration. This narration is based on a written and practiced script, but generally is largely delivered ad-lib.\n\nSources of inspiration for the attraction include a 1955 \"True-Life Adventure\", \"The African Lion,\" about a pride of lions, and the film \"The African Queen\". Imagineer Harper Goff referenced the \"African Queen\" frequently in his ideas; even his designs of the ride vehicles were inspired by the steamer used in the film. The project was placed on the schedule to open with the July 17, 1955 debut of Disneyland.\n\nWhen plans began to develop, Bill Evans, the Imagineer responsible for landscaping Disneyland and most of Walt Disney World, faced the daunting task of creating a convincing jungle on a limited budget. Aside from importing many actual tropical plants, he made wide use of \"character plants\" which, while not necessarily exotic, could give the appearance of exoticism in context. In a particularly well-known trick, he uprooted local orange trees and \"replanted\" them upside-down, growing vines on the exposed roots. Disney controls the clarity of the water (known as \"turbidity\") in order to obscure from guests' view the boat's guidance system and undesirable items like perches and mechanized platforms of the bathing elephants and hippos. Initially, the clean water was dyed brown but after a few years the colorant was changed to a green hue and in recent years a bluish-green has been used. The water of the Jungle Cruise is approximately 5 feet deep and is part of the park's 'dark' water system which circulates southward from the northern end of Frontierland's Rivers of America, through Fantasyland and creates the moat of Sleeping Beauty Castle. The water's journey continues flowing past Frontierland's entrance and into Adventureland where it meanders alongside the Tiki Room before entering the Jungle Cruise beside the ride's exit. The water returns to the south end of the Rivers of America via a 37\" diameter underground pipe near Tarzan's Treehouse. Originally, the Jungle Cruise waterway was 1,920 feet in length before being slightly shortened and re-routed in 1994.\n\nAlthough Goff and Evans can be credited with the creation and initial design of the ride, Marc Davis, recognized for his work on venerable attractions such as the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean, added his own style to the ride in later versions and Disneyland updates. The \"Indian Elephant Bathing Pool\" and \"Rhinoceros Chasing Explorers up a Pole\" were among his contributions.\n\nThe attraction was in the opening day roster of the park, and has remained open and largely unchanged in theme and story since then. The original plan was to use real animals, but these plans were abandoned once Disney realized that the animals would likely sleep during the day. Aside from alterations and maintenance changes, four completely new show scenes have been added to date. In 1994 the river channel was rerouted to make way for the queue buildings and entrance courtyard of the Indiana Jones Adventure.\n\nWhile the current version and most previous instances have made use of a comedic spiel, filled with intentionally bad puns, the original intent of the ride was to provide a realistic, believable voyage through the world's jungles. Until 1962, the original spiel had no jokes and sounded much like the narration of a nature documentary.\n\nThe queue and station are themed as the headquarters and boathouse of the Jungle Navigation Company, a river trading company located in a British colony (as evidenced by the Union Jack flying above the boathouse) circa 1938. The queuing area is cluttered with appropriate props, such as pinned insects, an old radio on top of a bookshelf, and a chessboard with miniature animals and decorated shotgun shells replacing the pieces. The extended queue winds upstairs, underneath an Audio-Animatronic hornbill, and then downstairs again. Big band music from the 1940s plays overhead, punctuated by jungle-related news bulletins, helping to reinforce the setting and threading together the show scenes and boat.\n\nOnce aboard the boats, guests are introduced to their skipper and they head into the jungle, allegedly never to return. The first rivers simulated are the Irrawaddy and Mekong rivers, representing tropical Southeast Asia. The boats sail through a dense rainforest inhabited by large butterflies and a pair of toucans, before passing by the Temple of the Forbidden Eye and a shrine to the Hindu monkey deity Hanuman. Passengers then glide precariously under the first of a pair of stone arches severely damaged by an earthquake centuries ago. These are part of the ruins of an ancient Cambodian city where a crumbling temple is one of the few things which have managed to avoid tumbling into the river. Here passengers see an Indo-Chinese tiger, giant spiders, king cobras and mugger crocodiles. Passing a statue of the elephant-headed Hindu deity Ganesha, the boats pass under the second arch and enter the Sacred Indian Elephant Bathing Pool. Here a large herd of Indian elephants frolic and squirt water at the passing vessels.\n\nThe theme moves to the rivers of Africa, and riders see a family of baboons, and a safari camp that has been overrun by gorillas. The boats narrowly avoid the dramatic waterfall, Schweitzer Falls (which riders are told is named after Dr. Albert Falls), and turn down Africa's Nile river where they pass between two African elephants, and large termite mounds. A tableau of the African Veldt follows, showing zebras, wildebeest, giraffes, and gazelles watching a pride of lions feasting on a zebra beneath a rocky outcropping. Beyond the lion's den, an angry rhinoceros has chased a safari party up a tree. Antelope and hyenas watch from nearby. The skipper then pilots the boat into the Congo river disturbing a pod of hippos that signal their intent to attack the boat. Armed with a gun filled with blanks, the skipper fires into the air to frighten them away.\n\nDrums and chanting are heard as the boats come to headhunter territory. The vehicles pass a native village before sailing into an ambush by natives wielding spears, the sound effects for which are usually provided by the skipper.\n\nThe boats now pass behind Schweitzer Falls (referred to as \"the Backside of Water\") to enter the Amazon River. Skeletal animal remains and warning signs featuring pictures of dagger-toothed fish forewarn the next show scene, where the boats encounter a swarm of leaping piranha. The guests then pass a couple of water buffalo and a boa constrictor before they meet shrunken head dealer Trader Sam (\"He'll trade you two of his heads for just one of yours\") before returning to the dock.\n\n\nDescription of specific changes:\nThe baboons at the safari jeep camp previously sat on the African termite mounds. A total of six lions have been removed since opening day: one that growled when the African Veldt was added, two lionesses from the Veldt that were fighting over a bloody strand of zebra meat, a lion and a lioness that each had a zebra leg in their mouth, and a dead lion hanging on a spit over a fire in the native village. Also removed from the Veldt were jackals barking at the pride.\n\nThere are 12 vehicles, with a maximum of 8 in operation at any given time. The boats in 1955 were painted as clean, idealized replicas, but have since been given a more realistic theming reflecting the grunge and wear of actual watercraft due to the addition of Indiana Jones Adventure and its ruggedness.\nNames in use:\n\nNames decommissioned in 1997:\n\nThe skipper introduces himself or herself, and begins to take the boat full of guests down the tropical rivers of the world. The ride starts out in the Amazon River, where the passengers encounter butterflies with one-foot wingspans, or as the skipper might say, twelve inches. The boat then passes Inspiration Falls, which transitions into the Congo River in Africa.\n\nThe skipper explains that there is a pygmy welcoming party waiting for them, but when the boat arrives at the beach, the canoes are empty, and the place deserted. The skipper wonders what scared off the pygmies, and they soon discover that it was a giant python. The boat then passes a camp that has been raided by gorillas, which transitions the cruise into the Nile River.\n\nAfter encountering two elephants, the boat passes along the African Veldt, where numerous African animals watch a pride of lions eat their kill. The boat then passes a lost safari group that has been chased up a pole by an angry rhinoceros and are now trapped. The group then passes by another waterfall, Schweitzer Falls (which riders are told is named after Dr. Albert Falls) and heads past the remains of a plane crash. The boat then encounters a pool of hippos, about to charge the boat until the skipper scares them off. Ominous drums are heard as the group enters headhunter territory. Natives are seen dancing near the boat and guests soon find themselves in an ambush. They escape and proceed into the Mekong River.\n\nThey enter a temple which has been destroyed by an earthquake. Inside, baboons, cobras, giant spiders and a tiger can be found. After they exit, they come across an elephant bathing pool where numerous elephants are relaxing in the water. The boat narrowly avoids being sprayed by water from one of the elephants. The cruise concludes after passing Chief Nami, the head salesman of the jungle, who offers two shrunken heads for one of the passengers'.\n\nThe Walt Disney World Jungle Cruise is set as a depression era British outpost on the Amazon River, operated by the fictional company, The Jungle Navigation Co., whose advertisement poster is painted on the wall near the exit of the attraction. Albert Awol's broadcast is different from that of Disneyland's, being ride specific. Also unlike Disneyland, the queue never extended to a second level.\n\nNear the Hippo Pool, a piece of a downed airplane can be seen along the shoreline. This is the back half of the Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior found at The Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the Casablanca scene.\nEach variety of plant throughout the attraction was carefully selected by landscape architect Bill Evans to ensure that the foliage would be able to endure Florida's unique climate: hot summers and relatively cool winters. The most difficult aspect of this was making sure these plants had the appropriate look and feel of traditional tropical plants in the equatorial jungle.\n\nA Holiday overlay, Jingle Cruise, runs during the Holiday season at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort. This started in the Holiday season of 2013.\n\nA Jungle Cruise themed restaurant, the Skipper Canteen, opened in December 2015 and expanded on the Jungle Navigation Co. storyline, making Dr. Albert Falls into the founder of the company in 1911, with his granddaughter Alberta Falls taking charge of the Navigation Company and the Jungle Cruise in the 1930s.\n\nThe queue of the Jungle Cruise is heavily themed with period artifacts, tools, gear, photos and more. It is intended to resemble an outpost where an exploration of the jungle rivers may be booked. It is divided into four main sections which may be opened or closed in sequence to accommodate crowd fluctuation. The queue was designed to wind about extensively so that guests may see all of the different artifacts in the queue. The most notable section of the queue is the office of Albert Awol.\n\nThere are 15 vehicles, with a maximum of 10 in operation at any given time.\n\nRetired boats\n\nThe Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland attractions are very similar to each other, with the exception of a few minor differences. While the boats in the Magic Kingdom's attraction travel counter-clockwise, the boats at Tokyo Disneyland travel in a clockwise direction.\n\nIn Tokyo Disneyland, the station and surrounding area are themed to a more upscale African city, as opposed to an isolated jungle outpost. This version shares a station building with the park's steam train ride, Western River Railroad. The spiels in Tokyo Disneyland are delivered in Japanese.\n\nThere are 13 vehicles, with a maximum of 12 in operation at any given time.\n\nAll boat names, except Orinoco Ida, are alliterations.\n\nDisneyland Paris does not have any Jungle Cruise attraction, due to the cold temperature and weather of northern France. Because many copies of the original Jungle Cruise attractions exist in other French theme parks, French guests might be used to the experience and not find it exciting. An indoor jeep ride called \"Jungle Expedition\" was originally planned at the opening of the park, but was cancelled due to financial difficulties.\n\nThe shape of Hong Kong Disneyland's route is significantly different compared to the others, and circumnavigates Tarzan's Treehouse. A grand finale is included with a battle between angry fire and water gods. Three languages are regularly available: Cantonese, English, and Mandarin. Each language has a separate queue, allowing visitors to experience the journey in their preferred language.\n\nThe queue takes place in a small boathouse of The Jungle Navigation Co. that is less elaborate than the boathouses found at the other parks. After winding through the queue, guests board one of the boats and meet their skipper who speaks either English, Cantonese, or Mandarin, to accompany the park's guests who speak many different languages themselves.\n\nThe boats then depart and head down the river, past Tarzan's Treehouse where the skipper tells guests to wave goodbye to the guests traversing the treehouse, for they will never see them again. The boats then drift past an Indian elephant and her calf playing in the water, followed by another elephant showering in a waterfall. A large bull Indian elephant emerges from the water squirting a plume of water at the boats with the guests narrowly avoiding the free shower.\n\nThe vessels then drift down a narrow stream past ancient Cambodian ruins which have been claimed by the jungle. Giant spiders and king cobras watch the boats as they move on. Up ahead several crocodiles are seen resting on a small beach, while a school of hungry piranha are jumping in the hopes of attacking the guests. The boats escape into Africa and they pass a large safari camp where several curious gorillas have discovered clothes, guns, hammocks, and books, as the \"Trashing the Camp\" song from \"Tarzan\" plays on a nearby 1930s radio. The African Veldt comes into view where antelope, giraffes, zebras, and African elephants stare at the boats. The vessels then drift into a small pool where a pod of hippos try to tip the boat. Several feet ahead a rhino is seen chasing a safari group up a tree while several hyenas look on laughing.\n\nSkulls and cloth impaled on broken bamboo sticks appears as tribal drums and horns fill the air. The skipper tells guests that they have entered head hunter country and must quietly sneak by. The boats slowly pass through the main village where several upright shields rest in the tall grass. A native notices the boats and all the shields now revealed to have head hunters behind them begin firing spears and poison darts at the boats as they narrowly escape into a rocky canyon. In the rocky canyon, the boats stop near two unusual rock formations that look like faces, revealed by the skipper to be the fire god and the water god who constantly feud over their differences. The fire god sets the river ablaze while the water god vomits a water bomb, causing the flames to die and the whole canyon to become a cloud of steam. The boats escape the canyon and pass a baby elephant before returning to the boathouse.\n\n\nThere are 9 vehicles, with a maximum of 8 in operation at any given time.\n\nAlbert Awol is a fictional Jungle Cruise boat captain and disc jockey for the Disney Broadcasting Company. Considered the \"Voice of the Jungle\", he broadcasts everything from news, to quizzes, reminders, weather, etc. on the DBC (Disney Broadcast Company). He also serves as a period disc jockey for the station, filling the airwaves with music from the 1930s Depression era.\n\nAlbert Awol was added in 1991 to the Jungle Cruise during a refurbishment. According to one report:\nAlbert's broadcast is projected not just over the Jungle Cruise queuing area, but over Adventureland as a whole, setting the time period. In Disneyland, Albert is replaced by \"Jungle Radio.\" Various air personalities comment on the environment, the luminaries who are in the area (including references to the designers of the attraction - Harper Goff, Bob Mattey, Winston Hibler [True-Life Adventure films, upon which Jungle Cruise is based]). The music is a good deal slower in pace and tempo than the tracks used at Walt Disney World. The music was previously linked with the outdoor speakers at the Temple of the Forbidden Eye (Indiana Jones Adventure), however, two separate tracks of material with similar tone and some songs now exist. The Jungle Radio at Disneyland does connect the setting with the nearby Indiana Jones attraction, and ties in announcements that reference Indiana Jones, and the temple in which the ride is set.\n\nSince 2013, a Christmas overlay called Jingle Cruise has run during the holiday season in the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland versions of the Jungle Cruise except for 2017 at Disneyland in which the overlay was not installed.\n\nIn April 2017, it was reported that the ride will undergo extensive planning to change the ride. The updated re-engineering and redesign has extended to the future-star of the film adaptation Dwayne Johnson, and his film production company. Johnson is working with Disney to implement the changes for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts locations worldwide.\n\nA studio recorded soundtrack of the \"Jungle Cruise\" was released in 1968 by Disneyland Records included as the B side of the album \"Walt Disney Presents The Enchanted Tiki Room and the Adventurous Jungle Cruise\" (ST-3966). The Jungle Cruise attraction has always featured narration by a live Disney Cast Member; for the release the narration was provided by Thurl Ravenscroft. This soundtrack was also used in Disneyland television features as early as 1964.\n\nFor years, Walt Disney Pictures had been toying with the idea of turning the \"Jungle Cruise\" into a full-length action adventure motion picture, which it would be loosely inspired by the theme park attraction of the same name. The film, originally scheduled for release in 2007, experienced various delays and changes. Shooting of the film, originally scheduled for 2006, was postponed. Moreover, the original screenplay by Josh Goldstein and John Norville was reportedly rewritten by Al Gough and Miles Millar. The film plot follows a group's riverboat journey through a jungle in search of a cure. Though initially announced to star \"Toy Story\" duo Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, a new iteration of the project is moving forward with Dwayne Johnson starring. The film is described as a \"period piece in the vein of Humphrey Bogart's \"The African Queen\".\" Later, Johnson signed on as a producer in addition to his starring role, and the film is scheduled to start filming in spring 2018. In April 2017, Johnson expressed his interest in having Patty Jenkins helm the project. In July later that year, Jaume Collet-Serra signed on to direct. In late January 2018, Emily Blunt joined the cast while Michael Green was hired to rework the script which was initially written by J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay. In March 2018, Jack Whitehall joined the cast as a relative of Emily Blunt's character. The next month, Édgar Ramírez and Jesse Plemons were cast as villains. Paul Giamatti joined afterwards as a \"crusty harbormaster\". On October 19, 2018, the film was delayed to July 24, 2020.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22487107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22487107", "title": "Lennie Aleshire", "text": "Lennie Aleshire\n\nLeonard Harrison Aleshire (April 27, 1890 – October 15, 1987) was a versatile American vaudeville and later country music performer from the 1920s into the 1960s. A singer, dancer and songwriter, he was also half of a musical comedy duo, Lennie and Goo Goo, with Floyd Rutledge. The pair appeared on local and national radio and television programs originating from Springfield, Missouri during the 1940s and 50s.\n\nLennie Aleshire was born April 27, 1890 in Christian County, Missouri, just south of Springfield. He was playing the fiddle by age six and learned the guitar, banjo and other instruments by ear. At 15, he lived with the Creek Indians near Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, though his mother was half Cherokee. After his parents died, he lived with his brother and sister near Dadeville. Aleshire and his brother John played the fiddle; their sister Linda played guitar. The Aleshire Trio staged their first vaudeville shows at a local silent movie theater with Aleshire sometimes performing in blackface.\n\nIn 1917, Aleshire was drafted for service in World War I, but was excused because he had lost three fingers on his left hand in a sawmill accident, which led to his nickname, the One Finger Fiddler. He worked for a Kansas City saddlery, a railroad, and played professional baseball for three seasons; but returned to vaudeville, writing the song \"Nixa Fling\" after working as a boiler engineer at a Nixa, Missouri cheese factory in 1926, the same year he met his wife, Mae.\n\nAleshire had a varied vaudeville career: he joined McMae Hill, and the troupe of magician and ventriloquist Professor Sage; and spent two years with the Cauble Brothers Circus traveling through the Midwest. He also appeared with Argentinean magician Dawes the Great, performed as a tap dancer, and toured Oklahoma with saxophonist Roy Wrightsman.\n\nAleshire first teamed up with his boyhood friend from Springfield, Floyd Rutledge, in the early 1920s. They developed a hillbilly musical comedy routine, playing traditional as well their homemade instruments which included cowbells strapped to their shoes. The pair toured with the Orpheum Circuit and played at the Palace Theatre in New York City. Aleshire also worked the Bert Levy West Coast vaudeville circuit. In 1928, they joined The Weaver Brothers and Elviry act, based in Springfield, and eventually became known as Lennie and Goo Goo. Aleshire served as straight man for Rutledge's slow-witted Goo Goo.\n\nAleshire was also a songwriter; his tune \"Iva Waltz\" was named for his daughter. His \"My Old Saddle Pal\" was sung by Gene Autry in his 1936 film, \"The Singing Cowboy.\" Aleshire also wrote \"Sleepy Time Waltz\", \"Ozark Waltz\", \"Blackberry Jam\" and \"Ukulele Melody\". In 1939 he co-wrote \"Prairie Reveries\" with Buddy Starcher.\n\nIn 1937, Aleshire joined WWVA-AM's \"Mountaineer Jamboree\" in Wheeling, West Virginia and worked with banjo player Dale Parker as part of the Rhythm Rangers for about a year. He later worked at WLW-AM in Cincinnati, Ohio; and in 1939 at WMMN-AM in Fairmont, West Virginia, where he and Rutledge became close friends with Louis \"Grandpa\" Jones. Jones formed an act called Grandpa Jones and his Grandsons consisting of Aleshire, Loren Bledsoe and Harold Rensler. Aleshire and Rutledge introduced Jones and Ramona Riggins to cowbells, which they adopted.\n\nThe duo returned to Springfield in the early 1940s and appeared on KGBX-AM, and Aleshire toured with Jones. In August 1944, Aleshire, Rutledge and Parker joined KWTO-AM in Springfield and were featured on \"Korn's-A-Krackin\"', carried nationally by Mutual Radio, and other shows. When KYTV-TV's \"Ozark Jubilee\" moved to ABC in 1955, Aleshire and Rutledge went along as Lennie and Goo Goo and were mainstays on the program for more than five years.\n\nIn 1955, RCA Victor released \"Ridin' The Fiddle\" featuring Aleshire and Parker with King Ganam and His Sons of the West.\n\nWhen \"Ozark Jubilee\" was canceled in 1960 (by then renamed \"Jubilee USA\"), Aleshire and Rutledge retired in Springfield but continued to perform; Aleshire also worked as an expert piano tuner and Rutledge, who years earlier had briefly been a local policeman, was a taxi driver (he died at age 64 in 1970). Aleshire and wife Mae had one son, Kenneth Chessnut; and daughter Iva.\n\nAleshire died in Springfield, Missouri on October 15, 1987 at age 97 and was interred in Palmetto Cemetery in Greene County. His widow, Mae, died September 7, 1996.\n\nSeveral of Aleshire's and Rutledge's homemade instruments are displayed at the Ralph Foster Museum at the College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri near Branson.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2538794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2538794", "title": "List of video game genres", "text": "List of video game genres\n\nA video game genre is a specific category of games related by similar gameplay characteristics. Genres are not usually defined by the actual content of the game or its medium of play, but by its common challenge.\n\nGenres may encompass a wide variety of games, leading to even more specific classifications called \"subgenres\". For example, an action game can be classified into many subgenres such as platform games and fighting games. Some games, most notably browser and mobile games, are commonly classified into multiple genres.\n\nThe following is a list of all commonly defined video game genres, with short descriptions for individual genres and major subgenres.\n\nAction games emphasize physical challenges that require Hand-eye coordination and motor skill to overcome. They center around the player, who is in control of most of the action. Most of the earliest video games were considered action games; today, it is still a vast genre covering all games that involve physical challenges.\n\nAction games are classified by many subgenres. Platform games and fighting games are among the best-known subgenres, while shooter games became and continue to be one of the dominant genres in video gaming since the 1990s. Action games usually involve elements of twitch gameplay.\n\nPlatform games (or \"platformers\") have gameplay primarily centered around jumping and climbing to navigate the character's environment while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Generally the player's character in a platform game is able to jump many times their own height and player is offered some control over their movement in midair as well as the height and distance of their jumps. Settings tend to be vertically exaggerated with lots of uneven terrain that the player can leap to or fall off of.\n\n\"Donkey Kong\" was one of the earliest and best-known platformers; the American gaming press classified it using the term \"climbing game\" at the time. \"Super Mario Bros.\" was one of the best-selling games of all time; more than 40 million copies were sold (excluding Game Boy Advance and Virtual Console sales). \"Jumping Flash!\" was the first console platformer to incorporate 3D graphics.\n\nIn shooter games (or simply \"shooters\"), players use ranged weapons to participate in the action, which takes place at a distance. Most shooters involve violent gameplay; lethal weaponry is used to damage opponents. However, some shooters, such as \"Splatoon\", have non-violent objectives.\n\nShooters, aside from subgenre classifications, can be further classified by their perspective of play. First-person shooters are played within the protagonist's perspective; they often include a heads-up display displaying key information such as the current health of the protagonist. In third-person shooters, the protagonist's body can be seen fully; the environment is rendered from a distance. Some shooters incorporate both perspectives.\n\nHero shooters are either first- or third-person multiplayer shooters that strongly encourage cooperative play between players on a single team through the use of pre-designed hero characters that each possess unique attributes, skills, weapons, and other activated abilities. While setting up a match, players on a team typically must each select a hero who is different from those selected by teammates and, as the match progresses, the players gain experience to unlock more powerful abilities for their hero. Outside of a match, players have the ability to customize the appearance of the heroes but with no other in-game effects. Such games are inspired by multiplayer online battle arena games like \"Dota 2\" and \"League of Legends\", and popular team-based shooters like \"Team Fortress 2\". Examples of hero shooters include \"Gigantic\", \"Overwatch\", and \"\".\n\nLight gun shooters are controlled with a gun-shaped controller; light guns function via a light sensor, hence the name \"light gun\". The technology has been used as early as the 1920s for shooter games, although electronic video gaming did not exist at that time.\nShoot 'em ups pit players, who are usually piloting some form of flying vehicle, or flying by some other means, against large waves of opponents; the player is continuously moving and must attack and avoid opponent's attacks as well as obstacles.\n\nSince the 1990s, shooters, most notably first-person shooters, have become widely successful in video gaming, accounting for a large percentage of video game sales. \"Wolfenstein 3D\", created by Id Software and released in 1992, was credited for pioneering gameplay and graphics elements incorporated by many other shooters. Also developed by Id and published one year after Wolfenstein 3D's release, \"Doom\" is broadly considered to be one of the most influential games in video gaming history. Other successful shooter series include \"Half-Life\", a widely acclaimed and commercially successful series noted for its influence on contemporary shooters; and the \"Call of Duty\" franchise, with more than 175 million sales across all its titles.\n\nFighting games center around close-ranged combat typically one on one fights or against a small number of equally powerful opponents, often involving violent and exaggerated unarmed attacks. Most fighting games feature a large number of playable characters and a competitive multiplayer mode. While most fighting games emphasize hand-to-hand combat, some fighting games such as Soulcalibur and Samurai Shodown center around combat with melee weapons. Many fighting games incorporate heavily emphasized attacks based on various martial arts systems. Fighting games were one of the dominant genres in video gaming until the late-1990s, where the genre saw a slight decline. This decline was short lived however, for titles such as Injustice, Dragonball FighterZ and Super Smash Bros dominate the fighter demographic of the modern era.\n\nBeat 'em ups (or \"brawlers\") are a related, but distinct genre to fighting games. While they both involve close-range combat, beat 'em ups put players against large waves of opponents as opposed to a few. Beat 'em ups often incorporate mechanics from other action genres and multiplayer in beat 'em up games tends to be co-operative rather than competitive. Beat 'em ups saw a sudden decline in popularity in the early 90's with the release of fighting games, but 3D beat 'em ups have kept the genre alive. Hack and Slash is a sub-genre often used to refer to weapons based beat 'em ups.\n\nThese games tend to emphasize subterfuge and precision strikes over the more overt mayhem of shooters, for example, the \"Metal Gear\" series, and the \"Sly Cooper\" series. In a Stealth game, players are usually still able to engage in loud, conspicuous combat, but are often punished for it. Other games, such as \"Dishonored\", the player can obtain their goal with or without stealth, but stealth is encouraged. The inclusion of stealth as a mechanic in a game does not necessarily make it a Stealth Game. For example, \"\" has an entire perk tree dedicated to \"Sneaking\", but there few opportunities to use it effectively until the player invests dozens of perks into it, and most of the dungeons in the game are set up in favor of the hack-and-slash strategy that most players adopt.\n\nSurvival games start the player off with minimal resources, in a hostile, open-world environment, and require them to collect resources, craft tools, weapons, and shelter, in order to survive as long as possible. Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the survival horror genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse.\n\nA battle royale game is a video game genre that blends the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a survival game with last man standing gameplay. Battle royale games challenge a large number of players, starting with minimal equipment, to search for weapons and armor and eliminate other opponents, while trying to stay in safe playable area which shrinks as the time passes, with the winner being the last competitor in the game. Notable battle royale games are \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" and \"Fortnite\".\n\nRhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player's sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as \"Dance Dance Revolution\" and music-based games such as \"Donkey Konga\" and \"Guitar Hero\". Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player is required to press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat.\n\n\"PaRappa the Rapper\" has been deemed the first influential rhythm game; whose basic template formed the core of subsequent games in the genre. Other popular rhythm games include Dance Dance Revolution, Maimai, , Cytus, Love Live: School Idol Festival, The Idolmaster, osu!, Taiko no Tatsujin, Crypt of the Necrodancer, etc.\n\nAction-adventure games combine elements of their two component genres, typically featuring long-term obstacles that must be overcome using a tool or item as leverage (which is collected earlier), as well as many smaller obstacles almost constantly in the way, that require elements of action games to overcome. Action-adventure games tend to focus on exploration and usually involve item gathering, simple puzzle solving, and combat. \"Action-adventure\" has become a label which is sometimes attached to games which do not fit neatly into another well known genre.\n\nThe first action-adventure game was the Atari 2600 game \"Adventure\" (1979). It was directly inspired by the original text adventure, \"Colossal Cave Adventure\". In the process of adapting a text game to a console with only a joystick for control, designer Warren Robinett created a new genre. Another typical Action-Adventure game is \"The Legend of Zelda\" by Nintendo, which involves puzzle solving, sword fighting, and item collecting. Because of their prevalence on video game consoles and the absence of typical adventure games, action-adventure games are often called \"adventure games\" by modern gamers.\n\nSurvival horror games focus on fear and attempt to scare the player via traditional horror fiction elements such as atmospherics, death, the undead, blood and gore. One crucial gameplay element in many of these games is the low quantity of ammunition, or number of breakable melee weapons. Notable examples include Silent Hill and Resident Evil.\n\nMetroidvania games (named after its two first well-known franchises, Metroid and Castlevania) feature a large interconnected world map the player can explore, but access to parts of the world is limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be opened after the player has acquired special tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements also aids the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one's steps across the map. Metroidvanias usually do not consist of any linear gameplay and often involve lots of backtracking - especially after new powerups or tools have been obtained. Bossfights are also a staple of metroidvanias, without which they would be considered puzzle or adventure games .\n\nAdventure games were some of the earliest games created, beginning with the text adventure \"Colossal Cave Adventure\" in the 1970s. That game was originally titled simply \"Adventure,\" and is the namesake of the genre. Over time, graphics have been introduced to the genre and the interface has evolved.\n\nUnlike adventure films, adventure games are not defined by story or content. Rather, adventure describes a manner of gameplay without reflex challenges or action. They normally require the player to solve various puzzles by interacting with people or the environment, most often in a non-confrontational way. It is considered a \"purist\" genre and tends to exclude anything which includes action elements beyond a mini game.\n\nBecause they put little pressure on the player in the form of action-based challenges or time constraints, adventure games have had the unique ability to appeal to people who do not normally play video games. The genre peaked in popularity with the 1993 release of \"Myst\", the best-selling PC game of all time up to that point. The simple point and click interface, detailed worlds and casual pace made it accessible, and its sense of artistic surrealism caused news outlets such as \"Wired Magazine\", \"The New York Times\" and the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" to declare that the gaming industry had matured. It had four proper sequels, but none managed to experience the same level of success. The success of \"Myst\" also inspired many others to create similar games with first person perspectives, surreal environments and minimal or no dialogue, but these neither recaptured the success of \"Myst\" nor of earlier personality-driven adventures.\n\nIn the late 1990s the genre suffered a large drop in popularity, mass-market releases became rare, and many proclaimed the adventure game to be dead. More accurately, it has become a niche genre. Adventure games are not entirely uncommon, but they tend to be very low budget in anticipation of modest sales. The genre was somewhat rejuvenated with the release of \"The Longest Journey\" in 1999, which emphasized stronger story elements and more interaction with different characters. A recent resurgence of adventure games on Nintendo consoles might signify a new interest in the genre. A successful Kickstarter campaign in 2012, run by Doublefine Studios, also spoke to the continued interest in Adventure games. The game produced as a result was mired in controversy and production delays, and to some, signalled the true end of the genre outside of niche markets.\n\nThe earliest adventure games were text adventures, also known as interactive fiction. Games such as the popular \"Zork\" series of the late 1970s and early 1980s allowed the player to use a keyboard to enter commands such as \"get rope\" or \"go west\" while the computer describes what is happening. A great deal of programming went into parsing the player's text input.\n\nGraphic adventure games emerged as graphics became more common. Adventure games began to supplement and later on replace textual descriptions with visuals (for example, a picture of the current location). Early graphic adventure games used text-parsers to input commands. The growing use of mice led to the \"point-and-click\" genre of adventure games, where the player would no longer have to type commands. The player could, for example, click on a hand icon and then on a rope to pick up the rope.\n\nA is a game featuring mostly static graphics, usually with anime-style art. As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels or tableau vivant stage plays. Many visual novels track statistics that the player must build in order to advance the plot, and permit a variety of endings, allowing more dynamic reactions to the player's actions than a typical linear adventure plot. Many visual novels are dating sims, including bishōjo games. Visual novels are especially prevalent in Japan, where they make up nearly 70% of PC games released. They are rarely produced for video game consoles, but the more popular games are sometimes ported to systems such as the Dreamcast or the PlayStation 2. The market for visual novels outside Japan, however, was nearly non-existent prior to the success of the Nintendo DS, for which several Japanese visual novels were released in the West, such as the \"Ace Attorney\" series.\n\nThe interactive movie genre came about with the invention of laserdiscs. An interactive movie contains pre-filmed full-motion cartoons or live-action sequences, where the player controls some of the moves of the main character. For example, when in danger, the player decides which move, action, or combination to choose. In these games, the only activity the player has is to choose or guess the move the designers intend him to make. Interactive movies usually differ from games that simply use full motion video, FMV, extensively between scenes in that they try to integrate it into the gameplay itself. This has been used in everything from racing games to fighting games. A few adventure game have tried to use the term to liken the storytelling of their games to those in movies, most notably the later \"Tex Murphy\" games and the more recent \"Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy)\", although they are more aptly classified as genre hybrids. Elements of interactive movies have been adapted for game cut scenes, in the form of Quick Time Events, to keep the player alert. Games like \"Resident Evil 4\" present obvious in-game prompts for the player to react to. Not doing so usually results in the player character either getting hurt or outright killed.\n\nAround this time, real-time 3D adventure games appeared. These included \"Nightfall\" in 1998, \"Shenmue\" in 1999, \"realMyst\" in 2000, \"Shadow of Memories\" in 2001, and \"\" in 2003. They augmented traditional adventure gameplay with some of the attributes more commonly associated with action games. For example, freedom of motion and physics-based behavior.\n\nRole-playing video games draw their gameplay from traditional [not always] role-playing games like \"Dungeons & Dragons\". Most of these games cast the player in the role of one or more \"adventurers\" who specialize in specific skill sets (such as melee combat or casting magic spells) while progressing through a predetermined storyline. Many involve manoeuvring these character(s) through an overworld, usually populated with monsters, that allows access to more important game locations, such as towns, dungeons, and castles. Since the emergence of affordable home computers coincided with the popularity of paper and pencil role-playing games, this genre was one of the first in video games and continues to be popular today. Gameplay elements strongly associated with RPG, such as statistical character development through the acquisition of experience points, have been widely adapted to other genres such as action-adventure games. Though nearly all of the early entries in the genre were turn-based games, many modern role-playing games progress in real-time. Thus, the genre has followed the strategy game's trend of moving from turn-based to real-time combat. The move to real-time combat began with the release of Square's (now Square Enix's) \"Final Fantasy IV\", the first game to use the Active Time Battle system; this was quickly followed by truly real-time role-playing games such as the \"Mana\" series, \"Soul Blazer\" and \"Ultima VII\". Some throwbacks to older turn-based system did exist such as the \"Golden Sun\" series for Game Boy Advance.\n\nThe action role-playing game or action RPG is a type of role-playing video game which incorporates elements from action games or action-adventure games. Some of the first action role-playing games were produced by Nihon Falcom in the 1980s, such as the \"Dragon Slayer\" series and \"Ys\" series. Later so-called \"\"Diablo\" clones\" are also part of this genre. Although the precise definition of the genre varies, the typical action RPG features a heavy emphasis on combat, often simplifying or removing non-combat attributes and statistics and the effect they have on the character's development. Additionally, combat always takes place using a real-time system (hence the \"action\") that relies on the player's ability to perform particular actions with speed and accuracy to determine success, rather than mainly using the player character's attributes to determine this.\n\nMassively multiplayer online role-playing games, or MMORPG, emerged in the mid to late 1990s as a commercial, graphical variant of text-based MUDs, which had existed since 1978. By and large, MMORPG feature the usual RPG objectives of completing quests and strengthening one's player character, but involve up to hundreds of players interacting with each other on the same persistent world in real-time. The massively multiplayer concept was quickly combined with other genres. Fantasy MMORPG, like \"Final Fantasy XI\", \"\", and \"The Elder Scrolls Online\", remain the most popular type of MMOG, with the most popular \"pay-to-play\" game being \"World of Warcraft\", and the most popular \"free-to-play\" games including \"RuneScape\" and \"TERA\", yet other types of MMORPG are appearing. Sci-fi MMORPG like \"Phantasy Star Online\" hold a smaller part of the market, with the popular space sci-fi game \"EVE Online\" being the most notable. Other massively multiplayer online games which do not have a conventional RPG setting include Second Life and Ingress.\n\nThe roguelike video game subgenre borrows its name and gameplay elements from the 1980 computer game \"Rogue\". Superficially, a roguelike is a two-dimensional dungeon crawl with a high degree of randomness and an emphasis on statistical character development. Though traditionally featuring a text user interface, many such games utilize graphic tiles to overcome character set limitations, for example: Pixel Dungeon on PC, Android and iOS.\n\nThe tactical role-playing game subgenre principally refers to games which incorporate gameplay from strategy games as an alternative to traditional RPG systems. Like standard RPG, the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies, but this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid. The genre has its origins in tabletop role-playing games, where each player has time to decide his or her characters' actions.\n\nSandbox RPG or Open World RPG allow the player a large amount of freedom and usually contain a somewhat more open free-roaming (meaning the player is not confined to a single path restricted by rocks or fences etc.) world. Sandbox RPGs contain similarities to other sandbox games such as the Grand Theft Auto series, with a large number of interactable non-player characters, large amount of content and typically some of the largest worlds to explore and longest playtimes of all RPG due to an impressive amount of secondary content not critical to the game's main storyline. Sandbox RPG often attempt to emulate an entire region of their setting. Popular examples of this subgenre include the \"Dragon Slayer\" series by Nihon Falcom, the early \"Dragon Quest\" games by Chunsoft, \"Zelda II\" by Nintendo, \"Wasteland\" by Interplay Entertainment, the \"SaGa\" and \"Mana\" series by Squaresoft, \"System Shock 2\" by Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios, \"Deus Ex\" by Ion Storm, \"The Elder Scrolls\" and \"Fallout\" series by Bethesda Softworks and Interplay Entertainment, \"Fable\" by Lionhead Studios, the \"Gothic\" series by Piranha Bytes, and the \"Xenoblade\" series by Monolith Soft.\n\nAlso known as DRPG (Dungeon RPG), this subgenre consists of RPGs where the player leads a party of adventurers in first-person perspective through a dungeon or labyrinth, typically in a grid-based environment. Examples include the aforementioned \"Wizardry\", \"Might and Magic\" and \"Bard's Tale\" series; as well as the \"Etrian Odyssey\" and \"Elminage\" series. Games of this type are also known as \"blobbers\", since the player moves the entire party around the playing field as a single unit, or \"blob\".\n\nMost \"blobbers\" are turn-based, but some titles such as the \"Dungeon Master\", \"Legend of Grimrock\" and \"Eye of the Beholder\" series are played in real-time. Early games in this genre lack an automap feature, forcing players to draw their own maps in order to keep track of their progress. Environmental and spatial puzzles are common, meaning players may have to, for instance, move a stone in one part of the level in order to open a gate in another part of the level.\n\nRPGs tend towards two sets of characteristics, sometimes referred to as Western and Japanese RPG (also referred to as \"WRPG\" or \"JRPG\"). The first (\"WRPG\") often involves the player creating a character and a non-linear storyline along which the player makes his own decisions. In the second type (\"JRPG\"), the player controls a party of predefined characters through a dramatically scripted linear storyline (though there are JRPGs such as \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" which contain action elements and sandbox environments). There are described advantages to—and dedicated fans of—each system, including fans of Western RPG in East Asia and Japanese RPG in Europe/North America. Western RPG include the \"Fallout\" series and \"Elder Scrolls\" series, while Japanese RPG include the \"Final Fantasy\" series and \"Dragon Quest\" series.\n\nSome RPG give the player several choices in how their story will unfold. Typically the player can have an effect on whether the enemies in the game will be taken out lethally or non-lethally. This is very popular because it makes the player have to deal with the consequences of their own choices whenever they fail to save someone or don't get the ending they desired, for example. This makes for a much more interactive experience between gamers and gameplay, also explaining their popularity. Some notable examples include the \" series\", \"Megami Tensei\", \"SaGa\", \"Mass Effect\" and \"Dragon Age\" series.\n\nDue to RPG origins with \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and other pen and paper role-playing games, the most popular setting for RPG by far is a fantasy world, usually with heavy medieval high fantasy influences, with series such as \"Diablo\", \"Final Fantasy\", \"Elder Scrolls\" and \"Baldur's Gate\" sharing a basic fantasy setting. However, numerous exceptions exist, with some notable examples including the East Asian settings of \"Far East of Eden\" and \"Jade Empire\", the steampunk settings of \"Final Fantasy VI\" and \"Grandia\", the science fiction settings of \"Star Ocean\", \"Xeno\", \"\", and \"Mass Effect\", the retro-futuristic setting of \"Fallout\", and the contemporary settings of \"Mother\", \"Megami Tensei\" and \"Alpha Protocol\".\n\nSimulation video games is a diverse super-category of games, generally designed to closely simulate aspects of a real or fictional reality.\n\nConstruction and management simulations (or CMS) are a type of simulation game which task players to build, expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources.\n\nIn city-building games the player acts as overall planner or leader to meet the needs and wants of game characters by initiating structures for food, shelter, health, spiritual care, economic growth, etc. Success is achieved when the city budget makes a growing profit and citizens experience an upgraded lifestyle in housing, health, and goods. While military development is often included, the emphasis is on economic strength. Perhaps the most known game of this type is \"SimCity\", which is still popular and has had great influence on later city-building games. \"SimCity\", however, also belongs to the \"God Games\" genre since it gives the player god-like abilities in manipulating the world. Caesar was a long-running series in this genre, with the original game spawning three sequels.\n\nBusiness simulation games generally attempt to simulate an economy or business, with the player controlling the economy of the game.\n\nA government simulation game (or \"political game\") involves the simulation of the policies, government or politics of a country, but typically excludes warfare. Recently, these types of games have gained the moniker \"serious game\".\n\nLife simulation games (or artificial life games) involve living or controlling one or more artificial lives. A life simulation game can revolve around individuals and relationships, or it could be a simulation of an ecosystem.\n\nBiological simulations may allow the player to experiment with genetics, survival or ecosystems, often in the form of an educational package. An early example is \"SimLife\", while relatively recent ones are \"\" and \"Spore\". In other educational simulations such as \"Wolf\", the player \"lives the life\" of an individual animal in a relatively realistic way. Hailed as one of the greatest life simulation games, however, is Creatures, Creatures 2, Creatures 3, where the player breeds generations of a species in a hugely detailed ecosystem.\n\nUnlike other genres of games, god games often do not have a set goal that allows a player to win the game. The focus of a god game tends to be control over the lives of people, anywhere from micromanaging a family to overseeing the rise of a civilization.\n\nPet-raising simulations (or digital pets) focus more on the relationship between the player and one or few life forms. They are often more limited in scope than other biological simulations. This includes popular examples of virtual pets such as \"Tamagotchi\", the \"Petz\" series, and \"Nintendogs\".\n\nSocial simulation games base their gameplay on the social interaction between multiple artificial lives. The most famous example from this genre is Will Wright's \"The Sims\".\n\nVehicle simulation games are a genre of video games which attempt to provide the player with a realistic interpretation of operating various kinds of vehicles.\n\nA flight simulation tasks the player with flying an aircraft, usually an airplane, as realistically as possible. Combat flight simulators are the most popular subgenre of simulation. The player controls the plane, not only simulating the act of flying, but also combat situations. There are also civilian flight simulators that do not have the combat aspect.\n\nRacing games typically place the player in the driver's seat of a high-performance vehicle and require the player to race against other drivers or sometimes just time. This genre of games is one of the staples of the computer gaming world and many of the earliest computer games created were part of this genre. Emerging in the late 1970s, this genre is still very popular today and continues to push the envelope in terms of graphics and performance. These games \"tend to fall into \"organized racing\" and \"imaginary racing\" categories\". Organized racing simulators attempt to \"reproduce the experience of driving a racing car or motorcycle in an existing racing class: Indycar, NASCAR, Formula 1, and so on.\" On the other hand, imaginary racing games involve \"imaginary situations, driving madly through cities or the countryside or even fantasy environments\". These \"imaginary\" racing games are sometimes called arcade racing games, in contrast to their more realistic \"racing simulation\" counterparts. Rollings and Adams note that \"racing games are often sold in the sports category,\" but \"from a design standpoint, they really belong in ... vehicle simulations\".\n\nSpace flight simulator games are a subgenre that involve piloting a spacecraft. Space simulators are different from other subgenres, and are not generally considered to be simulators, as their simulated objects do not always exist and often disregard the laws of physics. However, simulators of real spacecraft do exist: \"Orbiter\" is one example.\n\nTrain simulators simulate the vehicles, environments and often economics associated with railway transport. These are frequently historical in nature, reminiscing on the evolution and emergence of the railroad in various countries and the economic booms that often accompanied them.\n\nVehicular combat or \"car combat\" games focus on fast-paced action, as the player operates a car or other vehicle and attempts to disable or destroy CPU or human opponents. Vehicular combat games often allow a player to choose from a variety of potential vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Vehicular combat was born out of racing/shooter combinations like \"Spy Hunter\", \"RoadBlasters\" and \"Rock 'N' Roll Racing\", but differs in that the players can, if desired, take their vehicles off predefined routes and do battle wherever they please. A subgenre of vehicular combat is \"Mecha\" combat, where vehicles generally include giant robot-like tanks.\n\nStrategy video games focus on gameplay requiring careful and skillful thinking and planning in order to achieve victory and the action scales from world domination to squad-based tactics. In most strategy video games, says Andrew Rollings, \"the player is given a godlike view of the game world, indirectly controlling the units under his command.\" Rollings also notes that \"The origin of strategy games is rooted in their close cousins, board games.\" Strategy video games generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time and whether the game's focus is upon strategy or tactics. Real time strategy games are often a multiple unit selection game (multiple game characters can be selected at once to perform different tasks, as opposed to only selecting one character at a time) with a sky view (view looking down from above) but some recent games such as Tom Clancy's EndWar, are single unit selection and third person view. Like many RPG games, many strategy games are gradually moving away from turn-based systems to more real-time systems.\n\n4X refers to a genre of strategy video game with four primary goals: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate. A 4X game can be turn-based or real-time. Perhaps the best known example of this genre is Sid Meier's \"Civilization\" series. 4X games often cover a very large period of time, giving the player the control of an entire civilization or species. Typically these games have a historical setting, encompassing a large amount of human history (Empire Earth, Civilization, Golden Age of Civilizations) or a science fiction setting where the player controls a species set to dominate the galaxy (Master of Orion, Galactic Civilizations).\n\nArtillery is the generic name for early two or three-player (usually turn-based) computer games involving tanks fighting each other in combat or similar derivative games. Artillery games were among the earliest computer games developed and can be considered an extension of the original use of computers, which were once used for military-based calculations such as plotting the trajectories of rockets. Artillery games are considered a type of strategy game, though they have also been described as a type of \"shooting game.\" Examples of this genre are \"Pocket Tanks\", \"Hogs of War\", \"Scorched 3D\" and the \"Worms\" series.\n\nThe moniker \"real-time strategy\" (RTS), usually applied only to certain computer strategy games, (however, this genre is probably the most well known of strategy games and is what most websites mean when they say \"strategy games\") indicates that the action in the game is continuous, and players will have to make their decisions and actions within the backdrop of a constantly changing game state. Real-time strategy gameplay is characterised by obtaining resources, building bases, researching technologies and producing units. Blizzard Entertainment's \"Starcraft\" is a popular RTS played competitively in South Korea and televised to large audiences. Other notable games include the \"Warcraft\" series, \"Age of Empires\" series, \"Dawn of War\", \"Command and Conquer\", and \"Dune II\" (essentially the first RTS game). Outside PC world, very few strategy games are real-time; a few examples are \"Battle for Middle-earth II\", \"Pikmin\" and \"Halo Wars\". Even fewer ones use physical pieces, but at least \"Icehouse\" is an example of such.\n\nReal-time tactics (abbreviated RTT and less commonly referred to as fixed-unit real-time strategy) is a subgenre of tactical wargames played in real-time simulating the considerations and circumstances of operational warfare and military tactics. It is also sometimes considered a subgenre of real-time strategy, and thus may in this context exist as an element of gameplay or as a basis for the whole game. It is differentiated from real-time strategy gameplay by the lack of resource micromanagement and base or unit building, as well as the greater importance of individual units and a focus on complex battlefield tactics. Example titles include \"\", \"World In Conflict\", the \"Close Combat\" series, and early tactical role-playing games such as \"Bokosuka Wars\", \"Silver Ghost\", and \"First Queen\".\n\nMultiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), also known as \"action real-time strategy\" (ARTS), is a genre of strategy video games that originated as a subgenre of real-time strategy, in which a player controls a single character in one of two teams. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's main structure with the assistance of periodically spawned computer-controlled units that march forward along set paths. Player characters typically have various abilities and advantages that improve over the course of a game and that contribute to a team's overall strategy. A fusion of action games, role-playing games and real-time strategy games, players usually do not construct either buildings or units. The genre gained popularity in the 2010s as a form of electronic sports, encompassing games such as the \"Defense of the Ancients\" mod for \"Warcraft III\", its Valve-developed sequel \"Dota 2\", \"League of Legends\", \"Heroes of the Storm\", and \"Smite\".\n\nTower defense games have a very simple layout. Usually, computer-controlled monsters called \"creeps\" move along a set path, and the player must place, or \"build\" towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path for creeps, while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money for killing creeps, and this money can be used to buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range.\n\nThe term turn-based strategy (TBS) is usually reserved for certain computer strategy games, to distinguish them from real-time strategy games. A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action, and some games allow a certain number of moves or actions to take place in a turn. Like real-time strategy games, this genre can include many strategy games which are not solely turn-based games, and games which may contain other features not related to whether the game is turn-based or not. Examples of this genre are the \"Civilization\", \"Heroes of Might and Magic\", \"Making History, Advance Wars\" and \"Master of Orion\".\n\nSome recent turn-based strategy games feature a different gameplay mechanic, with a simultaneous resolution of the turns, every player preparing their future actions in the planning phase, then letting the game follow the orders given at the same time, causing orders to be interrupted by the opponent(s) actions, changing the gameplay from reacting to the opponent's action into guessing them. No definite name has been decided for this new genre, but STBS - Simultaneous Turn-based Strategy - seems to be the unofficial name. The first game of the genre was Combat Mission.\n\nThe gameplay of turn-based tactics games (TBT) is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Examples of this genre include the \"Wars\", \"Jagged Alliance\" and \"X-COM\" series, as well as tactical role-playing games such as the \"Fire Emblem\" and \"Final Fantasy Tactics\".\n\nWargames are a subgenre of strategy video games that emphasize strategic or tactical warfare on a map. Wargames generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time and whether the game's focus is upon military strategy or tactics.\n\nA grand strategy wargame is a wargame that places focus on grand strategy: military strategy at the level of movement and use of an entire nation state or empire's resources.\n\nSports are video games that simulate sports. This opposing team(s) can be controlled by other real life people or artificial intelligence.\n\nOne competes against time or opponent using some means of transportation. The most popular subgenre is racing simulators.\n\nSports games emulate the playing of traditional physical sports. Some emphasize actually playing the sport, while others emphasize the strategy behind the sport (such as \"Championship Manager\"). Others satirize the sport for comic effect (such as \"Arch Rivals\"). One of the best selling series in this genre is the \"FIFA (video game series)\" series. This genre emerged early in the history of video games (e.g., \"Pong\") and remains popular today.\n\nGames that have high competitive factor but does not represent any traditional sports or the concept is fictional designed by the developer (e.g. Ball Jacks).\n\nSports-based fighting games are titles that fall firmly within the definitions of both the Fighting game and Sports game genre, such as boxing and wrestling video games. As such, they are usually put in their own separate subgenres. Often the fighting is far more realistic than in traditional fighting games (though the amount of realism can greatly vary), and many feature real-world franchises or fighters. Examples of this include the Fight Night and WWE 2K series.\n\nA massively multiplayer online game (also called MMO and MMOG) is a multiplayer video game which is capable of supporting large numbers of players simultaneously. By necessity, they are played on the Internet. Many games have at least one persistent world, however others just have large numbers of players competing at once in one form or another without any lasting effect to the world at all. These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including the personal computer, video game console, or smartphones and other mobile devices.\n\nMMO games can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres, an example is the widely played game Minecraft which can be played both as an MMO or a single player game.\n\nCasual games are designed to be easily picked up and put down again, allowing for potentially short bursts of play, such as Call of Duty and most games on a mobile platform. This genre of gaming is meant to be a short and relaxing pastime, a rest in between other occupations and so is most popular with demographics who have less free time. For this reason the games often have auto-saving and syncing as standard so the games can be minimised, put into sleep or otherwise put down with no loss to the player. Market leaders in this genre are often boldly coloured, designed for intuitive interaction and have a high balance of reward to time to keep people coming back. Designers of these games should add a lot of \"juice\" (sound and motion elements that excite the senses) to make them stand out in a sea of highly similar games.\n\nDue to the aforementioned requirements, many of these games are quite simple to pick up and play without lengthy tutorials. Retaining players involves a lot of careful design of levels, challenges and events.\n\nParty games are video games developed specifically for multiplayer games between many players. Normally, party games have a variety of mini-games that range between collecting more of a certain item than other players or having the fastest time at something. Such games include the \"Mario Party\" series, \"Crash Bash\", and \"Rayman Raving Rabbids\". Versus multiplayer games are not generally considered to be party games.\n\nA programming game is a computer game where the player has no direct influence on the course of the game. Instead, a computer program or script is written in some domain-specific programming language in order to control the actions of the characters (usually robots, tanks or bacteria, which seek to destroy each other). In \"SpaceChem\", for example, players design circuits used for creating molecules from raw materials. \"Final Fantasy XII\" also includes some elements of a programming game, as the player creates the AI of his characters, although the player can also choose to directly control the action.\n\nLogic games require the player to solve logic puzzles or navigate complex locations such as mazes. They are well suited to casual play, and tile-matching puzzle games are among the most popular casual games. This genre frequently crosses over with adventure and educational games. \"Tetris\", labeled a puzzle game, is credited for revolutionizing gaming and popularizing the puzzle genre.\n\nTrivia games are growing in popularity, especially on mobile phones where people may only have a few minutes to play the game. In trivia games, the object is to answer questions with the goal of obtaining points. They may be based on real-life trivia shows such as Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? or Family Feud.\n\nMany popular board games and card games have computer versions. AI opponents can help improve one's skill at traditional games. Chess, Checkers, Othello (also known as Reversi), and Backgammon have world class computer programs. Mah-jongg and related games are immensely popular in China and Japan. Go is popular in East Asia, though it is infamously difficult to program a computer to play Go well. has had computer versions for some time, most notably \"\".\n\nIn an IGN article, \"Cookie Clicker\" is credited as one of the few games to have played a major role in the establishment of the genre of idle gaming.\n\nThis genre involves games that orient the player with a trivial task, such as clicking a cookie; and as the game progresses, the player is gradually rewarded certain upgrades for completing said task. In all, these games require very little involvement from the player, and in most cases they play themselves; hence the use of the word \"idle\".\n\nIn early 2014, Orteil released an early version of \"Idle Game Maker\", a tool allowing customized idle games to be made without coding knowledge.\n\nWhile most video games are designed as entertainment, many video games are designed with additional purposes. These purposes are as varied as the nature of information itself—to inform, persuade, or stimulate. These games can have any kind of gameplay, from puzzles to action to adventure.\n\nAdvergames, in the context of video game genres, refers to promotional software specifically made to advertise a product, organization or viewpoint. The first advergames were distributed on floppy disk by the Chef Boyardee, Coca-Cola, and Samsung brands, while the first cereal box advergame was Chex Quest in 1996. The majority of advergames are found online and mostly include simple and cheaply made Flash games. Some advergames were released to consoles, like Pepsiman for Sony PlayStation.\n\nArt games are designed so as to emphasize art or whose structures are intended to produce some kind of non-ludological reaction in its audience. Art games typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design. This concept extends to the realm of modified (\"modded\") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non-art-games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling. Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as \"videogame art.\"\n\nCasual games have very simple rules or play techniques and a very low degree of strategy. They also require no long-term time commitment or special skills to play, making them easy to learn and play as a pastime. There are comparatively low production and distribution costs for the producer. Casual games typically are played on a personal computer online in web browsers, although they now are starting to become popular on game consoles. The purpose of the casual game is to entertain, but with a much lower commitment than other video games.\n\nChristian games attempt to provide the dual purposes of spreading the Christian religion to non-believers through the medium of video games, and providing gamers who identify as Christian with a common pool of games that neither challenge their beliefs nor offend them. Christian video games were first developed by Wisdom Tree for the NES, without license. While largely regarded as derivative titles by the mainstream gaming culture, Christian games have nevertheless expanded in distribution since their inception.\n\nEducational games, as the name implies, attempt to teach the user using the game as a vehicle. Most of these types of games target young users from the ages of about three years to mid-teens; past the mid-teens, subjects become so complex (e.g. Calculus) that teaching via a game is impractical. Numerous subgenres exist, in fields such as math or typing.\n\nEsports games are multiplayer games that are usually played competitively at the professional level. These games are often targeted at the \"hardcore\" gaming audience, and are usually first-person shooter games, requiring twitch-based reaction speed and coordination, or real-time strategy games, requiring high levels of strategic macro- and micromanagement, or MOBAs, requiring both.\n\nAn exergame (portmanteau of \"exercise\" and \"game\") is a video game that provides exercise. \"Exergames\" sub-divide into two main implementations, those with a game specifically designed to use an exercise input device (for example, the game \"Wii Fit\" using the Wii Balance Board) and those implementations using a genre of a game. Games fit into the category of entertainment, and similarly \"exergames\" are a category of \"exertainment\" (formed from \"exercise\" and \"entertainment\"). \"Exertainment\" refers to one aspect of adding entertainment to an exercise workout.\n\nPersonalized games are created for one specific player or a group of players usually as a gift. They are hand-made to feature real names, places and events from the recipient's life. Usual occasions for such games are birthdays, anniversaries, and engagement proposals.\n\nSerious games are intended to educate or train the player. These games tend to promote \"education, science, social change, health care or even the military.\" Some of these games have no specific ending or goal in the game. Rather, the player learns a real life lesson from the game. For example, games from websites such as Newsgaming.com and gamesforchange.org raise political issues using the distinct properties of games.\n\nAs video games are increasingly the subject of scientific studies, game genres are themselves becoming a subject of study.\n\nAn early attempt at analysis of the action and adventure genres appeared in a Game Developers Conference 2000 paper 'Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World'. This critiqued a variety of adventure and action games to categorize gameplay and interaction for adventure, action, and hybrid genres. It provided a graph of the genres along the axes of 'immediacy' vs 'complexity', with an 'ideal-zone' for gameplay that covered and linked adventure and action games. It detailed various interaction styles present in these genres and extrapolated to future user interface and gameplay possibilities for these and other genres. Some of these have since been adopted by persistent worlds. For example, Second Life uses some of the gameplay investment and interface elements described in section 4 of the paper.\n\nIn a University of Queensland study, game enjoyment was correlated with attributes such as immersion, social interaction, and the nature of the goals. These may be underlying factors in differentiating game genres.\n\nStatistical scaling techniques were used in a study presented at the 2007 Siggraph Video Game Symposium to convert subject ratings of game similarity into visual maps of game genres. The maps reproduced some of the commonly identified genres such as first-person shooters and god games. A Michigan State University study found that men have a higher preference for genres that require competition and three-dimensional navigation and manipulation than women do.\n\n\n\n\n"}

All the same, a number of major literary figures have also written genre fiction, for example, John Banville publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black, and both Doris Lessing and Margaret Atwood have written science fiction. Furthermore, Nobel laureate André Gide stated that Georges Simenon, best known as the creator of the fictional detective Jules Maigret, was \"the most novelistic of novelists in French literature\".\n\nNeal Stephenson has suggested that, while any definition will be simplistic, there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction. On the one hand, literary authors are frequently supported by patronage, with employment at a university or a similar institution, and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics. On the other hand, Stephenson suggests, genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales. \n\nHowever, the distinction is becoming blurred with major writers of literary fiction, like Nobel laureate Doris Lessing, as well as Margaret Atwood, writing science fiction. Doris Lessing described science fiction as \"some of the best social fiction of our time\", and called Greg Bear, author of \"Blood Music\", \"a great writer\". Also Georges Simenon, the creator of the Maigret detective novels, has been described by American composer and writer Ned Rorem as \"one of the five greatest French writers of our century\". Rorem placed Simenon in the company of Proust, Gide, Cocteau, and Sartre. \n\nIn an interview, John Updike lamented that \"the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier. ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit\". Likewise, on \"The Charlie Rose Show\", Updike argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because \"they are written in words\".\n\nCharacteristics of literary fiction generally include one or more of the following:\n\n\n"}

The title refers to a fictional political scandal enacted on \"Master Pictures Studios\", a fictional movie company that is actually a cover for arms trading. The title of the play also references other real-life political scandals, such as Watergate and others subsequently given the suffix -gate.\n\nThe play is set in the Sherman Adams Room at the John Mitchell Building in Washington, D.C.. The \"Select Joint Congressional Committee Investigating Alleged Covert Arms Assistance to Alleged Other Americas\" investigates the CIA's attempt to divert arms to Central American guerrillas through a motion picture company's high-budget action film, entitled \"Tet.\" (a reference to the Tet Offensive)\n\n\"Mastergate\" is a satire on congressional investigative committee hearings that took place during the McCarthy Era, on the Watergate investigation, and on the Iran-Contra affair. In his opening address, the chairman explains that the purpose of the hearings is to find out what the president knew and if he had any idea of the affair.\nThe satire employs many aspects of rhetoric and word-play, including puns, malapropism, mixed metaphors, tautology and Washington double-speak.The playwright said of his work that it is \"First and foremost...a play about language. It's not for me to discover that politicians are corrupt or full of hot air. It's really about what they and television have done to the way we speak and the way we listen.\" The play uncovers aspects of the absurd in the working life of government employees; for example, it portrays a non-meeting, a non-discussion, and people being present in the minutes of the meeting despite not attending.\n\nIt has been argued that several of the characters have real-life counterparts, for example, Major Manley Battle may be based on Oliver North.\n\n\n\"Original Broadway Run\" \nCriterion Centre Stage Right \nFirst Preview: September 22, 1989 \nOpening Date: October 12, 1989 \nClosing Date: December 10, 1989 \nPreviews: 23 \nPerformances: 69\n\n\"Original Production Credits\" \nLarry Gelbart \"Writer\" \nMichael Engler \"Director\" \nPhilipp Jung \"Scenic Design\" \nCandice Donnelly \"Costume Design\" \nStephen Strawbridge \"Lighting Design\" \nMarc Salzberg \"Sound Design\"\n\nThe play was filmed for television in 1992. The production used the Emerald Room of the Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles as a backdrop to the hearings.\n\nThe play was recorded by L.A. Theatre Works during their 1991-1992 season with a cast including Walter Matthau and Harold Gould.\n\nPositive reviews included that of Jack Kroll in \"Newsweek\", who wrote, \"If George Orwell were a gag writer, he could have written \"Mastergate\". Larry Gelbart's scathingly funny takeoff on the Iran-Contra hearings is a spiky cactus flower in the desert of American political theatre.\" Similarly, Frank Rich of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"When \"Mastergate\" is funny, it is very funny. When it is not, it still stands up for a patriotic integrity beyond the understanding of the clowns who parade across its national stage.\"\n\nBy contrast, Howard Kissel of the \"Daily News\", wrote \"If you think the title is funny, you'll probably enjoy \"Mastergate.\" If you find it adolescent, which I'm afraid I do, stay home and read Mark Twain on politics.\" Likewise, Linda Winer of \"Newsday\" wrote, \"\"Mastergate\" is a one-joke extended sketch that, unfortunately, never manages the leap to dramatic - much less philosophical - revelation of much we didn't already know. Nevertheless, the joke is a very good one, performed with deadpan delight by deft imitators.\"\n\n\nA film was made in 1992 based on the play.

{"id": "2973964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2973964", "title": "Penetron", "text": "Penetron\n\nThe penetron, short for penetration tube, is a type of limited-color television used in some military applications. Unlike a conventional color television, the penetron produces a limited color gamut, typically two colors and their combination. Penetrons, and other military-only cathode ray tubes (CRTs), have been replaced by LCDs in modern designs.\n\nA conventional black and white television (B&W) uses a tube that is uniformly coated with a phosphor on the inside face. When excited by high-speed electrons, the phosphor gives off light, typically white but other colors are also used in certain circumstances. An electron gun at the back of the tube provides a beam of high-speed electrons, and a set of electromagnets arranged near the gun allow the beam to be moved about the display. The television signal is sent as a series of stripes, each one of which is displayed as a separate line on the display. The strength of the signal increases or decreases the current in the beam, producing bright or dark points on the display as the beam sweeps across the tube.\n\nIn a color display the uniform coating of white phosphor is replaced by dots or lines of three colored phosphors, producing red, green or blue light (RGB) when excited. These primary colors mix in the human eye to produce a single apparent color. In order to produce the same resolution as the B&W display, a color screen needs to have three times the number of pixels. This presents a problem for conventional electron guns, which cannot be focussed or positioned accurately enough to hit these much smaller individual patterns.\n\nA number of companies were working on various solutions to this problem in the late 1940s. At the same time, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had set aside a block of the UHF spectrum for new television channels, and later decided these new channels would be used to broadcast color signals. After extensive tests they found that the only usable system was one developed by CBS that broadcast three B&W images in turn, a full frame of red, then green, then blue. This concept was known as \"field-sequential\" broadcast. CBS built sets that produced color by spinning a color-filter disk in front of a conventional B&W set, timed to follow the frames. To reduce flicker, the frame rate was increased from 60 to 144 frame/s. This made the CBS system incompatible with existing B&W broadcasts, but since it was being used only on the new UHF frequencies this was not considered to be a serious problem.\n\nThe disk, often called a color wheel, comprised three sectors, each a transparent color filter. The colors were red, green, and blue. Because a given sector had to cover the whole screen, image size was limited. Furthermore, any fast motion created primary-colored trailing edges of the objects that were moving. Some recent projection TVs employed color wheels.\n\nThe penetron was original designed by Koller and Williams while working at General Electric (GE). It was initially developed as a novel way to build a single-gun color television with the simplicity of a conventional B&W set. Like the B&W tube, it used a uniform coating of phosphor on the display with a single electron gun at the rear. However, the phosphor coating is applied in layers of different colors, red on the inside closest to the gun, and blue on the outside closest to the front face of the tube. Colors were selected by increasing the power of the electron beam, which allowed the electrons to flow through any lower layers to reach the proper color.\n\nIn a conventional set, voltage is used to control the brightness of the image, not its color, something that the new design also had to achieve. To address these competing needs, the color selection was provided by an external mechanism. The gun was modulated as it would be in a B&W set, with increasing power producing a brighter spot on the screen. A set of fine wires placed behind the screen provided the extra energy needed to select a particular color layer. Since the phosphors were relatively opaque, the system required very high accelerating voltages, between 25 and 40 kV. An improved version was introduced that used transparent phosphor layers and thin insulating layers between them that reduced the required voltages. The dielectric ensured that stray electrons, either off-voltage from the guns or secondary emission from the phosphors themselves, were stopped before they reached the screen.\n\nThe penetron was ideally suited for use with the CBS system. The same timing that caused the mechanical wheel of the CBS sets to turn was instead used to change the voltage of the color selection grid, to the same end. The low switching rate, 144 times a second, meant that the changing high-voltage was not a major source of high-frequency noise. Unlike the mechanical CBS system, the penetron had no moving parts, could be built at any size (which was difficult to do with the disk), and had no problems with flicker. It represented a major advance in display technology.\n\nIt was not long after the introduction of CBS's system that a new system was introduced by RCA that eventually won out. Unlike CBS's field-sequential system, RCA directly encoded the color for every spot on the screen, a system known as \"dot-sequential\". The advantage to the RCA system was that the primary component of the signal was very similar to the B&W signal used on existing sets, which meant the millions of B&W televisions would be able to receive the new signal while newer colors sets could see these in either B&W or color if that additional signal was provided. This was a huge advantage over the CBS system, and a modified version was selected by the NTSC as the new color standard in 1953.\n\nThe major disadvantage was the difficulty in correctly focussing the beam on the correct color, a problem RCA solved with their shadow mask system. The shadow mask is a thin metal foil with small holes photoetched into it, positioned so the holes lie directly above one triplet of colored phosphor dots. Three separate electron guns are individually focussed on the mask, sweeping the screen as normal. When the beams pass over one of the holes, they travel through it, and since the guns are separated by a small distance from each other at the back of the tube, each beam has a slight angle as it travels through the hole. The phosphor dots are arranged on the screen such that the beams hit only their correct phosphor. To ensure the holes line up with the dots, the mask is used to create the dots using photosensitive material. \n\nThe new broadcast system presented a serious problem for the penetron. The signal required the color to be selected at high speeds \"on the fly\" as the beam was being drawn across the screen. This meant the high voltage color selection grid had to be rapidly cycled, which presented numerous problems, notably high-frequency noise that filled the interior of the tube and interfered with the receiver electronics. Another modification was introduced to address this issue, using three separate guns, each fed with a different base voltage tuned to hit one of the layers. In this version no switching was required, eliminating the high-frequency noise.\n\nProducing such a system proved difficult in practice, and for home television use GE instead introduced their \"Porta-Color\" system, a dramatic improvement on RCA's shadow mask system. Other developers continued working with the basic system attempting to find ways of solving the high frequency switching issues, but none of these entered commercial production.\n\nFor other uses, however, the advantages of the penetron remained. Although it was not well suited to the dot-sequential method of color broadcast, that was only important if one was receiving over-the-air broadcasts. For uses where the signal could be provided in any needed format, like in computer displays, the penetron remained useful. When a full color gamut was not needed, the complexity of the penetron was further reduced and it became very attractive. This lent it to custom applications like military avionics, where the nature of the input signal was not important and the developer was free to use any signaling style they wished.\n\nIn the avionics role the penetron had other advantages as well. Its use of phosphors in layers instead of stripes meant that it had higher resolution, three times that of the RCA system. This was very useful for radar display and IFF systems, where the images were often overlaid with textual cues that required high resolution to be easily readable. Additionally, since all of the signal reached the screen in a penetron, as opposed to 15% of it in a shadow mask tube, for any given amount of power the penetron was much brighter. This was a major advantage in the avionics role where power budgets were often quite limited, yet the displays were often hit with direct sunlight and needed to be very bright. The lack of the shadow mask also meant the penetron was much more robust mechanically, and didn't suffer from color shifting under g-loads.\n\nPenetrons were used from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s, mostly for radar or IFF systems where two-color displays (green/red/yellow) were commonly used. Improvements in conventional shadow masks removed most of its advantages during this period. Better focusing allowed the size of the holes in the shadow mask to increase in proportion to the opaque area, which improved display brightness. Brightness was further improved with the introduction of newer phosphors. Problems with doming were addressed through the use of invar shadow masks that were mechanically robust and attached to the tube using a strong metal frame.\n\nPenetron displays were also offered as an option on some graphics terminals, where the high speed color-switching was not required and the penetron's limited gamut was not a concern. IDI offered such displays as an $8,000 option on their IDIgraph and IDIIOM series teminals.\n\nTektronix, a major manufacturer of oscilloscopes, offered a limited gamut of color in some of its CRT 'scopes, using Penetron-type technology.\n\nIn most versions of the penetron the tube has an inner layer of red and outer layer of green, separated by a thin dielectric layer. A complete image is produced by scanning twice, once with the gun set to a lower power that is stopped in the red layer, and then again at a higher power that travels through the red layer and into the green. Yellow can be produced by hitting the same location on both sweeps.\n\nIn a display where the colors are either on or off and various brightness levels do not have to be created, the system can be further simplified by removing the color selection grid and modulating the voltage of the electron gun itself. However, this also causes problems because the electrons will reach the screen faster when accelerated with higher voltages, which means that the deflection system has to be increased in power as well to ensure the scanning creates the same screen size and line widths on both passes.\n\nSeveral alternative arrangements of the penetron were experimented on to address this problem. One common attempt used an electron multiplier at the tube face instead of the selection grid. In this system a low-energy scanning beam was used, and magnets were set to cause the electrons to strike the sides of the multipliers. A shower of higher-energy electrons would then be released and travel to the layered phosphors of a normal penetron arrangement. It was later noticed that the beams emanating from the multipliers landed in rings, which allowed a new arrangement of phosphors in concentric rings instead of layers.\n\nThe main advantage to the penetron is that it lacks the mechanical focusing system of a shadow mask television, which means that all of the beam energy reaches the screen. For any given amount of power, the penetron will be much brighter, typically 85% brighter. This is a major advantage in an aircraft setting, where power supply is limited but the displays need to be bright enough to be easily read even when directly lit by sunlight. The system is guaranteed to produce the correct colors in spite of external interference or the g-forces of maneuvering – a very important quality in aviation settings. The penetron also offered higher resolutions because the phosphor was continuous, as opposed to the small spots in a shadow mask system. Additionally, the lack of the shadow mask makes the penetron much more robust mechanically.\n\n"}

Buddy proposed marriage as was mandatory contractually. However, upon his \"fiance's\" arrival, Buddy was held up with the Armageddon group. His fiance ultimately decided to marry the sergeant who was awaiting Buddy's surrender.\n\nDesiree's daughter, Karen, Ruby's niece, married and had a child with an African-American man. They named the child Whitney. Ruby never knew of the child. She also didn't attend the wedding. Ruby ran into her daughter in a food market. She was shopping with her granddaughter, Ruby's great-grandchild. This mini-reunion resulted in a reconciliation for mother and daughter, and an introduction for Whitney and Ruby. Ruby takes her great-grandchild to the Department of Motor Vehicles, and uses her to get out of jams when she gets caught making off-color remarks to store employees.\n\nRuby stocked up on what she calls \"vintage dinners\" - frozen TV dinners that were taken off the market when health experts discovered that some of the additives were causing cancer. She still serves them on special occasions like Thanksgiving for her family.\n\nRuby resides in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, California (North Hollywood according to Ruby herself in a home shopping call in). Her address is, 264 1/2 Fernando Venezuela Boulevard, (formally Appleby), Hollywood, California, 90036. She dubs her neighborhood \"Boomshakalaka Town\". The majority of Ruby's neighbors are Hispanic. \"It used to be a real elegant neighborhood, but now all the children have earrings and you can smell the rice and beans in the air.\"\n\nRuby's relationship with her neighbors is nothing short of tumultuous. Ruby was raped by her neighbor's dog, Raging Bull. Taking matters into her own hands, Ruby had her friend Dean castrate the dog with bricks as to not have her attacked again.\n\nMexican Jehovah's Witnesses frequently turn up on Ruby's doorstep. She quickly turns them away. Ruby is not a religious person.\n\nFrozen blocks of urine have crashed through Ruby's bathroom ceilings from space shuttles.\n\nRuby's makeup career began when a motion picture came to her hometown called \"Pirate of the Plains\" starring actor Errol Flynn. Flynn took a liking to underage Romaine and slept with her. Ruby, threatening to make a scandal out of the affair, was offered a job doing makeup which kicked started her fifty-year career. She is the oldest working Hollywood Makeup Union member. \"I've been working here fifty years, hell, I'm almost out of rouge!\" Ruby choose to make her makeup the old-fashioned way: in a blender. She has over 720 film and television shows to her credit.\n\nRuby has worked on such stars as Barbara Eden, Bette Davis, Clark Gable (\"Mogambo\"), Debbie Reynolds, Debra Paget and Dennis Weaver (in \"Seven Angry Men\", they didn't have the budget for twelve), Humphrey Bogart, Jane Kaczmarek, Jane Seymour, Jane Wyman (who never said more than a few words to her), Katharine Hepburn, Kirk Douglas (\"The Vikings\"), Maureen O'Hara, Mickey Rooney (she cut out fresh orange peel teeth for him for his Japanese character I.Y. Yunioshi in \"Breakfast At Tiffany's\"), Nick Nolte, Ronald Reagan ('powered his nose' for Chesterfield cigarette ads), Rose Marie, Spencer Tracy, the cast of \"Bonanza\", and has applied putty to Candice Bergen's neck. She also worked for legendary actress, Joan Crawford. \"My job was to draw her eyebrows in five minutes before the alarm went off.\" Crawford's two adopted children implored Ruby to help save them from their mother who was \"strapping them to the bed and giving them enemas\". Ruby went on the side of the woman who \"signed her paychecks\".\n\nRuby has related that she put actor Tony Curtis in a diaper since the director wouldn't let him climb down for bathroom breaks in the movie \"Trapeze\".\n\nRuby got to make amends with actress Vivian Biltmore, the woman who got her fired off the (film) set claiming that she was drunk. Ruby did Biltmore's makeup for her Oscar-winning performance in \"Faded Splendor\". Ruby reconciled with the star while acting as makeup mortician.\n\nRuby also worked on actress Jayne Mansfield. \"I got to the scene of the accident where Jayne Mansfield's head rolled along the side of that highway. Sad thing was, I had done her roots only three days prior. Can you believe her luck?\"\n\nRuby worked on \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (which was the closet thing she ever had to a religious experience). Actress Angela Lansbury accused her of drinking the wine for the Last Supper scene. Ruby was subsequently fired.\n\nRuby did Burt Reynolds' makeup for \"Smokey and the Bandit\".\n\nShe has worked on such motion pictures as \"Showgirls\", doing makeup for actress Elizabeth Berkley. Ruby used ice-cubes on Berkley's nipples before every take. Ruby has also done makeup for the porn industry. Her work can be seen in \"Plymouth Cock.\" \"I never needed a 'beaver brush' when I worked with Minnelli!\"\n\nRuby has had multiple affairs. The list includes: Anthony Quinn, Cornel Wilde, John Garfield, Lawrence Welk, Lorne Greene, Robert Mitchum, John Edgar Hoover, Joe McCarthy. Ruby swears that when she worked with Rock Hudson he was \"all hands.\" Ruby worked on \"Magnificent Obsession\" starring Hudson and Jane Wyman.\n\nShe has only been arrested once in her life. \"It was on one of those low-budget shows. It was all about people turning into rats.\" A half-pound of cocaine was found in the hair and makeup trailer on the set of a B movie Ruby was working on. She was innocent, but years prior she did let a gaffer rub some on one of her nipples and lick it off. \"He got a bigger kick out of it than I did. That's for sure.\"\n\nRuby's favorite film is \"The Lost Weekend\". She helped Ray Milland research his role. \"[I]t took more than a weekend, I can tell ya!\"\n\nRuby is adamant that Liberace was not gay. She saw him and Carol Burnett \"canoodling\" in a restaurant.\n\nShe rejects the reported life story of Grace Kelly. \"She slept with every leading man she ever worked with.\"\n\nRuby tried to cover up the bruises on actress Lana Turner, given to her by abusive boyfriend Johnny Stompanato. \"He smacked her around, and she liked it!\"\n\nRuby worked on actress Hedy Lamarr. In response to Orson Welles' \"The War Of The Worlds\" radio broadcast, Lamarr and Ruby dove underneath the makeup trailer, \"with our kissers in the dirt for six hours.\" \"Hedy was so mad, she put a gypsy curse on Orson, which is why he got so fat,\" says Ruby.\n\nUnbeknownst to the public, Ruby was the \"Deep Throat\" that brought 1970s actress Linda Granger's career to halt. This brought an end to both Linda's hit television series \"VIP Lounge\", and to her character Vicki Starr, who was killed off in the program. Ruby leaked that Linda was a drug addict who tried to snort the translucent power from her makeup kit. The last straw was when Ruby took it away from her, and Linda slapped her. Linda also, at some point, got Ruby fired from the set of \"Vegas Vixens\".\n\nBack in the 1950s, Ruby had the opportunity to become a secret agent for the FBI. A listening devise was transplanted in Ruby's back molar to spy on possible communist Hollywood movie stars. While spying on John Garfield, Garfield misinterpreted Ruby's (drunk) facial expressions, and thought she was coming onto him. After a brief liaison, Ruby worked every John Garfield picture.\n\nRuby took it upon herself to spy on possible communist sympathizers in Hollywood for her then lover, Senator Joseph McCarthy. Being in the makeup business, she had prime access to spy on the stars.\n\nDriving home after a day of doing makeup on a George Schlatter comedy show, Ruby was startled when her Buick began shaking violently. Ruby jumped out of her car thinking it was another California earthquake. Suddenly, a beam of bright light shone in front of her. A green figure emerged from a metallic mobile home-shaped spacecraft. The creature led Ruby aboard. There she drank and danced with the creature she called, \"Mayor of the Moon\" and \"the top alien back home.\" She was then probed by the creature. Soon after, she was led back to her car which had been washed and simonized. Ruby went to the FBI to tell them of her encounter.\n\nRuby's brand of cigarette choice is Pall Mall. She began smoking as early as seven years old. She has what many would describe as an alcohol problem, but Ruby would never admit to this. She sometimes refers to her alcohol as \"medication\", or a purifier. She is not one to refrain from taking medication for her artificial hip, (which was put in backwards), with beer. She is keen on not missing Happy Hour at Smog Cutters, which she frequently drives to in her blue Buick. She enjoys champagne music and wine tasting. Ruby is known to call into The Family Spending Channel, a home shopping network, when she's had \"a few too many.\"\n\nRuby only gets mammograms as to ensure that she doesn't get dropped by Artist Guild's health insurance program. \"Even if I get a lump out here on the Matterhorn, by the time it gets to base camp, I'll be 105.\"\n\nRuby has had a hysterectomy.\n\n\n"}

Directed by Fred Young and starring Chatir Harro, Noorsini, and Astaman, it follows a young doctor who, after his fiancée is blinded in an automobile accident, becomes an optometrist and restores her sight.\n\nAs a sign of his love, the medical student Hardjono has given his fiancée Karnasih his handkerchief. After Hardjono finishes his final exams, his parents give him a new car, with which Hardjono takes Karnasih on holiday to Mega Mendung, near Bogor. However, during their excursion the car crashes into a log. Though Hardjono receives only minor injuries, Karnasih is blinded in the accident.\n\nIn the weeks afterwards, Karnasih—hoping to conceal her loss of sight and thus preserve his love for her—refuses to meet with Hardjono. Undaunted, Hardjono continues to contact her. When they do meet, Karnasih pretends that she can still see, a ruse which fails after Hardjono attempts to give her a handkerchief which has fallen to the ground.\n\nHardjono, hoping to become an optometrist and restore Karnasih's vision, decides to go abroad and receive further training. Karnasih, meanwhile, dedicates her time to educating poor children at her own school, the Taman Karnasih.\n\nSix years pass, and Hardjono—having received the training he sought—returns. He operates on Karnasih. Six weeks pass, and Karnasih's vision is restored, allowing her to see her beloved again.\n\n\"Saputangan\" was directed by Fred Young as the second film for his company Bintang Soerabaja, following \"Sehidup Semati\" (\"One in Life, One in Death\"). Young initially wrote the story as a stage play for his theatrical troupe, also named Bintang Soerabaja. The story was adapted into a screenplay by Tan Tjoei Hock, who had joined the company together with financier and film producer The Teng Chun. Production began in September 1949 and was, at the time, estimated to require two months of filming.\n\nThough the film was shot in black-and-white, the titular handkerchiefs in \"Saputangan\" were hand-tinted. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that this hand tinting, done owing to references to the handkerchiefs' colour, was done poorly, such that the colour was jittery.\nThe film starred Chatir Harro, Noorsini, and Astaman. It also featured Netty Herawaty, Darussalam, Ribut Rawit, Mohammad Jusuf, Sukarsih, R.A. Sri Mulat, Pak Kasur, and Lilik Sudjio. Its soundtrack featured seven songs, including \"Inilah Laguku\" (\"This is My Song\"), \"Asmara Kelana\" (\"Love of the Wanderer\"), \"Saputangan\" (\"Handkerchief\"), \"Pulau Bali\" (\"The Island of Bali\"), and \"Saputangan Tanda Kasih\" (\"Handkerchief, Sign of Love\").\n\nA novelisation of \"Saputangan\" was published by Gapura in 1949; the publishing house, owned by Andjar Asmara, had novelised all Indonesian films produced or in production since independence up to that point. The film was in theatres by February 1950, when it was screening in Jakarta. The film was exported to Singapore, where it was banned by the film censor Jack Evans in May 1950 for being \"not up to standards\"; J. B. Kristanto, in his \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" (\"Indonesian Film Catalogue\"), suggests that the issue was Communism-inspired dialogue. This ban was lifted on 1 June 1950, and \"Saputangan\" was soon screened to popular success at the Alhambra Theatre.\n\nThe reviewer for the \"Sunday Courier\" received \"Saputangan\" warmly, writing that the film was \"unlike any other\" and was the first Indonesian film to not feature any fighting.\n\n\"Saputangan\" may now be lost. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, Kristanto records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.\n\n"}
{"id": "4450450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4450450", "title": "Suspense", "text": "Suspense\n\nSuspense is a state of mental uncertainty, anxiety, of being undecided, or of being doubtful. In a dramatic work, suspense is the anticipation of the outcome of a plot or of the solution to an uncertainty, puzzle, or mystery, particularly as it affects a character for whom one has sympathy. However, suspense is not exclusive to fiction.\n\nIn literature, films, television, and plays, suspense is a major device for securing and maintaining interest. It may be of several major types: in one, the outcome is uncertain and the suspense resides in the question of \"who, what, or how\"; in another, the outcome is inevitable from foregoing events, and the suspense resides in the audience's anxious or frightened anticipation in the question of \"when\". Readers feel suspense when they are deeply curious about \"what\" will happen next, or when they know what is likely to happen but don’t know \"how\" it will happen. It would be difficult (and perhaps pointless) to write a piece of fiction in which there were not some issue the reader had a burning wish to find out about. Consequently, even in historical fiction, with characters whose life stories are well known, the \"why\" usually brings suspense to the novel.\n\nAn adjunct to suspense is foreshadowing, as found in hints of national crisis or revolution in Isabel Allende’s \"House of the Spirits\" (1991).\n\n\nSome authors have tried to explain the \"paradox of suspense\", namely: a narrative tension that remains effective even when uncertainty is neutralized, because repeat audiences know exactly how the story resolves. Some theories assume that true repeat audiences are extremely rare because, in reiteration, we usually forget many details of the story and the interest arises due to these holes of memory; others claim that uncertainty remains even for often told stories because, during the immersion in the fictional world, we forget fictionally what we know factually or because we expect fictional worlds to look like the real world, where exact repetition of an event is impossible.\n\nThe position of Yanal is more radical and postulates that narrative tension that remains effective in true repetition should be clearly distinguished from genuine suspense, because uncertainty is part of the definition of suspense. Baroni proposes to name \"rappel\" this kind of suspense whose excitement relies on the ability of the audience to anticipate perfectly what is to come, a precognition that is particularly enjoyable for children dealing with well-known fairy tales. Baroni adds that another kind of suspense without uncertainty can emerge with the occasional contradiction between what the reader knows about the future (cognition) and what he desires (volition), especially in tragedy, when the protagonist eventually dies or fails (\"suspense par contradiction\").\n\n\n\n"}

The plot and content of the conversation is drawn from popular mythology but the performance mainly consists of an impromptu debate between characters involving sarcasm, puns, philosophy positions and humour. The main plot is sung from the same oral texts used for the yakshgana form of dance- drama. Performers claim that this was a more intellectual rendition of the dance during the monsoon season.\n\nThe art form is popular in Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Shimoga districts of Karnataka and Kasaragod district of Kerala. It is a derived form of Yakshagana—a classical dance or musical form of art from the same region.\n\nA typical Tala-Maddale show consists of veteran artists sitting in a circular fashion along with a Bhagavata (the singer, with \"Tala\" or pair of small hand cymbals) and a \"Maddale\" (a type of drum) player. Artists play the roles of characters in stories, typically, from Ramayana, Mahabharata, and other puranas. Some consider the as a good presentation of oratorial skills.\n\nArtists are normally well versed with the Hindu epics and puranas. Kannada language is the normal medium of communication. Tala-Maddale performances are mostly held during the night, the traditional reason being that in ancient times, people finished their work by this time and assembled in temples to watch Tala Maddale. It is organized by either hobbyists who are interested in the art at their houses or as a public event in villages and towns.\n\nAs is common in many Indian art forms, A Tala Maddale performance is commenced with a puja to Lord Ganesh (the Hindu God of knowledge, learning and art) with a prayer song by Bhagavatha. Usually this song is \"Gajamukhadavage ganapage\". This tends to be followed by a combination of pre scripted as well as ex tempore debates between the artists. Hence, while the average length of a performance is about three hours, it can extend depending upon the debate. Due to the latter, artists are expected to be well versed with the subject matter too. In ancient times, Tala-Maddale performances often took the form of all-night performances, from 7 pm right up to 6 am.\n\nSubjects of Tala Maddale performances normally focus on episodes from the Hindu epics of Bhagavata and Puranas. However, episodes have also been created on other more current issues, some of which include the Second World War, the Tashkent Agreement, the Indian freedom struggle \"(Swarajya Vijaya)\" and computerisation \"(Ganakasura Kalaga)\".\n\nSome of the popular Tala maddale artists are Sheni Gopala Krishna Bhat, Kerekai Krishna Bhat, Kerekai Umakant Bhat, Polali Shankaranarayana Shastri, Shankaranarayana Samaga, Vasudeva Samaga, Prabhakara Joshi, M.V. Hegde, Kumble Sundar Rao, M.L. Samaga, Padekallu Vishnu Bhat, Sadashiva Alva Talapady, Appu Nayak Athrady, Ramana Acharya and Prashanth Belur. Artha vaibhava or the grandeur of dialogues tends to be a highlight of these performances relished by the rasikas (audience).\n\nIn August 2016, the story of the Indian Freedom Struggle, Swarajya Vijaya, was enacted in Tala Maddale in the outer yard of the Sri Ananteshwara Temple at Rajangana, Karnataka. The episode (prasanga) had been written by M.V. Hegde. A similar Tala Maddale performance related to the Indian freedom struggle had been held at this very place on 14 August 1947 when India achieved freedom from British Colonial powers.\n\nYou may watch a video clip of Taala Maddale ತಾಳ ಮದ್ದಲೆ session here.\n\nIntroduction to Maddale https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbPtmXeIowQ\n"}

Since TangoVia Buenos Aires understands tango as a constantly evolving living art form, it promotes all of its formats as contemporary and alive.\n\nThe organization's main goal is the development and implementation of educational and preservation projects linked to tango, especially the recovery of original sheet music, recordings, films and all other historical material related to the genre. TangoVia Buenos Aires also produces festivals, concert seasons, books and educational tools, documentaries and CDs.\n\nSince its inception, TangoVia Buenos Aires has worked with the Orquesta Escuela de Tango Emilio Balcarce (“Emilio Balcarce” Tango Orchestra School), created by artistic director Ignacio Varchausky and directed today by the prestigious maestro Néstor Marconi. The award-winning documentary “” — directed by Caroline W. Neal and co-produced by TangoVia Buenos Aires — traces the birth and development of this pedagogical programme based on oral transmission, thanks to which young musicians learn the orchestral styles of tango, its language and secrets, directly from great musicians who played in the orchestras of the 1940s and 1950s and remain active today.\n\nOfficially presented on 17 June 2009, the Digital Tango Archive is TangoVia's exhaustive and almost archaeological effort to recover lost materials relating to the history of tango recordings. Unique in the world - the Digital Tango Archive already houses over 700 original arrangements for the tango orchestra (orquesta típica) and more than 600 for bandoneon solos. Through the digitalisation of high quality recordings, high resolution digital scanning of photographs, scores, musical arrangements and the correct transcription of video archives, a security copy is being created of the enormous amount of existing material. Its classification according to multiple criteria enables this material, once reserved to a few scholars, to be offered to everyone for free consultation. In Argentina there are at least one hundred thousand tango recordings made between 1902 and 1995 (end of the analogical era). However, less than 20% of this material is available on CD. There are already three thousand recordings that appear in catalogues, and thousands of hours of radio and TV programmes, which no longer exist in any format and have been lost forever.\n\nThrough a series of activities, TangoVia Buenos Aires has contributed to the promotion, preservation and first-hand enjoyment of the art of one of the most influential Argentine musicians in history: Horacio Salgán. One example is the artistic production of the CD “Raras Partituras 4” featuring Salgán’s unknown compositions and arrangements for both tango orchestra (recorded by the Gran Orquesta TangoVia Buenos Aires) and for piano solo (recorded by Andrés Linetzky). The CD was produced in collaboration with the Biblioteca Nacional de Argentina (Argentina's National Library) and was followed by the book “Arreglos para orquesta típica: Tradición e innovación en manuscritos originales” (Arrangements for a Typical Tango Orchestra: Tradition and Innovation in Original Manuscripts), co-published with the National Library and offering for the first time Salgán’s original arrangements for tango orchestra, as well as an analysis, bibliography and catalogue of Salgán’s work.\n\nSince TangoVia Buenos Aires believes the tango tradition continually reinvents itself, it produces new recordings and festivals every year, featuring today’s most notable artists in contemporary tango. Since 2003 TangoVia Buenos Aires has been the artistic producer of the Buenos Aires Tango Festival in Paris, in conjunction with the National Theater Palais Chaillot; 2008 marked the fourth edition of this festival. Other productions include the Festival Montpellier Danse 03, the Festival Buenos Aires Tango in the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome in both 2006 and 2008, and the Festival TangoVia Buenos Aires in both Genoa, Italy and Lille, France in 2005.\n\nIn the field of CD production, TangoVia Buenos Aires has launched two series. One of them is \"El arte del bandoneón\" (The Art of the Bandoneon). This series intends to create and preserve a kind of musical memory: a unique register of the most outstanding contemporary bandoneon players, recorded intimately playing solos on the bandoneon. The series began with the CD “Instantaneas” by Julio Pane and continued in 2008 with the CDs “Tiempo Esperado” by Néstor Marconi, “Mi Fueye Querido” by Leopoldo Federico, which won the 2009 Latin Grammy Award for Best Tango Album, and “Mi Refugio” by Walter Rios. The second series “El arte de la orquesta típica\" (The Art of the Tango Orchestra) began with “Amanecer Ciudadano” featuring an orchestra directed by the renowned bandoneonist Víctor Lavallén.\n\nTangoVia Buenos Aires is supported by numerous public and private institutions, both in Argentina and abroad, including The Government of the City of Buenos Aires, la Sociedad Argentina de Autores y Compositores de Música (SADAIC), la Asociación Argentina de Intérpretes Musicales (AADI), Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Biblioteca Nacional de la Republica Argentina, Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA), Festival de Tango Buenos Aires, IICES, Jazz at Lincoln Center, CODARTS (Conservatory of Rotterdam), Sydney Youth Orchestra, Fondazione Musica per Roma and Parco della Musica, Publishing Houses Warner/Chappell Music and Epsa Publishing, and the Foundation “La Casa del Tango”.\n\n"}

{"id": "356118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=356118", "title": "Transatlantic Records", "text": "Transatlantic Records\n\nTransatlantic Records was a British independent record label. The company was established in 1961, primarily as an importer of American folk, blues and jazz records by many of the artists who influenced the burgeoning British folk and blues boom. Within a few years, the company had started recording British artists. The company's philosophy was intentionally eclectic.\n\nThe label was founded by Englishman Nat Joseph who started the company at the age of 21 after visiting the US and realizing that there was a wealth of music that was not being made available in the UK to British music fans. Transatlantic imported labels from the US such as the jazz labels Prestige and Riverside and the Tradition folk music label. From the outset, many of the covers included photography and design by Brian Shuel. Transatlantic were also instrumental in the importation of MK records (a Russian classical label), which were then issued with the original Russian labels, but with an English printed sleeve.\n\nThe company's first commercial success came not from music but from three sex education albums. The controversy over these records led to sales approaching 100,000 and the resulting financial lift gave the company money to develop its musical base.\n\nSome of their early records included artists as diverse as The Dubliners, actress Sheila Hancock, jazz singer Annie Ross, actresses Jean Hart and Isla Cameron, and Shakespearean actor Tony Britton. They managed to mix the folk music interest with the money making capacity of the sex education records by issuing \"When Dalliance was in Flower\" – a series of bawdy songs performed by Ed McCurdy and licensed from the American Elektra label. As often happened, these were issued first on the Transatlantic label in the UK and then on the subsidiary label XTRA. The catalogue numbers often contained \"TRA\" within the prefix, thus MTRA, XTRA, and LTRA were all used. The latter prefix was used with a series of LPs produced by Bill Leader (who worked with Nat Joseph from the outset as an engineer). Amongst these \"Leader\" records were recordings by Nic Jones, Martin Simpson, Mick Ryan, Bandoggs (another Nic Jones group), Andrew Cronshaw, and Al O'Donnell.\n\nWith the advent of psychedelia and flower power the Transatlantic stable of artists achieved greater success, culminating in the formation of the supergroup Pentangle. Meanwhile, Transatlantic had been extending its eclecticism, recording such as the eccentric audio collageist Ron Geesin, and The Purple Gang, whose \"Granny Takes A Trip\" was banned by the BBC in 1967. CBS had released the extremely successful contemporary music budget sampler with The Rock Machine Turns You On in 1967. Before CBS could follow up, Transatlantic released \"Listen Here!\" early in 1968. Like 'Rock Machine' the record was priced at 14/11d (£0.75) – but Transatlantic took promotion one stage further by not only printing the track listing on the front, but also the price. The record was designed to preview not only the forthcoming Pentangle double album, but solo records by members Bert Jansch and John Renbourn. \"Listen Here!\" also served to introduce a new group The Sallyangie, with siblings Mike and Sally Oldfield.\n\nIn 1975, Joseph sold a 75% share of his company to Sidney Bernstein's Granada Group and the company became part of Granada. There was a culture clash between the independent-spirited Transatlantic and the corporate sensibilities of Granada and two years later Granada sold its share in Transatlantic to the Marshall Cavendish publishing company, which also acquired Joseph's 25% share. The new company was renamed Logo Records. In the 1990s, Logo Records and the Transatlantic Records catalogue was sold to Castle Communications (now Sanctuary Records).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3343435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3343435", "title": "Xenosaga: Pied Piper", "text": "Xenosaga: Pied Piper\n\nXenosaga: Pied Piper is a role-playing video game co-developed by Monolith Soft, Namco Mobile, and Tom Create. The game was published by Namco in 2004 for mobile devices. A spin-off of the \"Xenosaga\" trilogy and forming part of the \"Xeno\" metaseries, the storyline follows the human life of cyborg Ziggurat 8—a key character in the \"Xenosaga\" trilogy—a century before the events of \"Xenosaga Episode I\". Gameplay follows a similar system to the mainline \"Xenosaga\" games but adjusted for mobile devices.\n\nThe storyline of \"Pied Piper\" was planned from an early stage, and was incorporated as a mobile title after Monolith Soft was approached by Namco's mobile division. The storyline was written by series creators Tetsuya Takahashi and Soraya Saga; \"Pied Piper\" would be Saga's last project for the \"Xenosaga\" series. The game's title is a reference to the German legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. Originally released through Vodafone Live, it would later be released through NTT DoCoMo's i-mode.\n\nSimilar to the rest of the \"Xenosaga\" series, \"Xenosaga: Pied Piper\" is a role-playing video game in which the player controls a party of characters to progress through environments linked to the main narrative. The player, taking the role of main protagonist Jan Sauer, explores environments from a 2D overhead perspective, with a combination of conversations and cinematic cutscenes advancing the narrative; battles take place in a virtual space tied to the story. Enemies encountered during exploration are fought using a turn-based battle system carrying over mechanics from \"Xenosaga Episode I\"; characters can save \"Boost\" points to interrupt an enemy's turn to perform an early action. Each character has specific actions they are specialized at, such as Jan being skilled with knife-based attacks. Actions include standard attacks and special attacks triggered using points accumulated by death blows dealt to enemies in previous battles.\n\n\"Pied Piper\" is set a century before the events of \"Xenosaga Episode I\"; taking place 4000 years in the future, humanity has left Earth and established civilization in another part of the Milky Way galaxy under the rule of the Galaxy Federation. The story follows Federal Police Special Operations member Jan Sauer investigating a series of terrorist attacks on the Federation's hyperspace transport network U.M.N.. The man behind the terrorist attacks is a mysterious figure called Voyager, whose U.M.N.-based crimes are accompanied by cruel attacks on civilian women and children. As he continues to investigate, Jan is forced to navigate sensitive political negotiations between the Federation and the Immigrant Fleet theocracy, who worship an ancient artifact called the Zohar. Jan's investigations reveal Voyager's identity as Erich Webster, a member of their team whose addiction to information led him to become what he is in search of the god-like entity U-DO. On the point of death after his Congress contact Dmitri Yuriev stops providing him with the drugs necessary to counter U-DO's influence, Erich manipulates the Immigrant Fleet to communicate with U-DO through the Zohar. Rejected by U-DO, he is instead granted a new life as a being called a Testament by Wilhelm, immortal CEO of Vector Industries. Having killed everyone close to Jan including his wife and son, Voyager asks him to choose between eternal life as a Testament or being killed by him; Jan instead shoots himself. Jan is later resurrected as the cyborg Ziggurat 8, playing a key role in the events of the \"Xenosaga\" trilogy. Ziggurat 8's history with Voyager is alluded to when the characters cross paths throughout the series, but it is not explained fully until \"Xenosaga Episode III\", which includes an extensive plot summary of \"Pied Piper\" and major character profiles.\n\nThe story of Ziggy was always part of series creator Tetsuya Takahashi's plan for the \"Xenosaga\" project, but Monolith Soft had yet to decide in what form it should be presented. Takahashi later stated that Ziggy's story was originally part of the planned scenario for \"Xenosaga Episode II\". The team were then contacted by the mobile development division of series publisher Namco, asking whether Monolith Soft could work with them on a mobile property. The team decided to use the mobile game to communicate Ziggy's story and agreed to the collaboration. Namco Mobile developed the game, while Monolith Soft handled the story development. External studio Tom Create helped develop the game. The creation of \"Pied Piper\" formed part of a move by the newly-established lead developers of \"Xenosaga\" to expand the series into other media following the release of \"Episode I\". The game's script was co-written by series creators Tetsuya Takahashi and his wife Soraya Saga. \"Pied Piper\" was Saga's last contribution to the \"Xenosaga\" series prior to leaving the project in 2005. The game's title is a reference to the German fable of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. \"Pied Piper\" was first announced in July 2004. The game was originally published exclusively for Vodafone devices, a version was released on 5 July 2006 for NTT DoCoMo's i-mode service. The third video game release in the \"Xenosaga\" series, the game is one of two games to remain exclusive to Japan.\n\n"}
