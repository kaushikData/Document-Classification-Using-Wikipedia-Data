The island has since been covered with fill and used for Interstate 787.\n\nIn the 1880s, thousands of visitors jammed Pleasure Island, also known as \"Dreamland.\" In truth, it was not an actual island, but was separated from the mainland by the Erie Canal.\n\nBy Memorial Day, 1907, Pleasure Island was built up and re-opened as Al-Tro Island Park, named for the two cities it was located between, Albany and Troy. It featured 40-piece orchestra in a dance hall, a roller-skating rink, a roller coaster, a theater with 4,000 seats, its own miniature railroad, a pony track and more than a hundred other attractions. The park even had its own police force consisting of 15 uniformed officers to maintain safety and order. A boardwalk extended the entire length of the island.\n\nBy the early 1920s, Al-Tro Island Park began to fall out of favor due to changing tastes in leisure. No one knows exactly when it closed or what happened to it. Most agree that the park \"vanished without a trace.\" The Mid-City Amusement Park was constructed as a replacement nearby on Broadway, also in Menands, but it too has since been destroyed.\n"}

Its sister newspaper is \"Al Masaiya\", is the only afternoon newspaper in the country with limited influence and readership.\n\nThe paper is published in broadsheet format with 48 pages, both colour and black and white contents. It has more than thirty national and international branches.\n\n\"Al Jazirah\" was established in 1960 by Al Jazirah Corporation. The chairman of the newspaper is Mutlaq bin Abdullah. Othman Al Omeir who currently owns the liberal Arabic e-newspaper \"Elaph\" was a member of the paper's board of directors. Furthermore, he was a sport correspondent in the early 1970s and later, London correspondent of the paper. In 1977, Abdel Rahman Al Rashid was appointed editor-in-chief of the daily, who also served as a correspondent and later as its Washington bureau chief from 1981 to 1985. The current editor-in-chief of the newspaper is Khalid bin Hamd Al Malik.\n\n\"Al Jazirah\" is considered by Anti-defamation League as very conservative as well as pro-Islamic. The paper is also described as pro-government.\n\nThe paper is said to have a limited circulation and is not widespread in contrast to the other Saudi papers. However, it is widely distributed in Saudi Arabia and in other Arab and European countries. Global Investment House reported the market share of the paper as around 6.0% in November 2009. In 2008, \"Al Jazirah\" became the first Saudi daily which reported its subscription numbers and sales. It is also the first Saudi newspaper to announce its circulation figures quoting the National Distribution Company, a third party company owned equally by Saudi newspapers. The paper underwent its first circulation audit in November 2009.\n\n\"Al Jazirah\" had a circulation of 85,000 copies in 2001. The daily's circulation was given as 93,000 by Western media observers in 2002. The estimated circulation of the paper in 2003 was 80,000 copies. Its 2007 circulation figure is given to be 110,000 by World Association of Newspapers. The confirmed circulation of the paper is reported to be more than 131,000 copies in June 2008. The circulation of the daily, which was confirmed by the BPA, was 125,415 copies for the last six months of 2011. For the first six-month period of 2013 the paper had a circulation of 123,097 copies.\n\nIt is argued that \"Al Jazirah\" is one of four leading Saudi daily newspapers along with \"Al Watan\", \"Al Riyadh\" and \"Al Madina\". At the beginning of the 1990s, \"Al Jazirah\" and \"Al Riyadh\" competed against each other to be more influential than the other.\n\nThe paper was awarded the best print prize in Asia by IFRA in Manila in 2007 and its website was awarded the digital excellence award by the Saudi Ministry of Communications and Information Technology in 2007. In addition, the editors of the paper were invited by the World Association of Newspapers to its 2007 conference held in South Africa. It was the first invitation of the association for a Saudi daily.\n\n\"Al Jazirah\" usually publishes reports and interviews concerning national, Arab and international issues. The paper is mostly known for its daily supplements on different topics such as economy, sports, culture, computers, medicine and science. It also has a weekly supplement, \"Telecom and Digital World\". It also carries cartoons.\n\nThe Arab Press Network states that the paper extensively covers the activities of the ruling Saudi family and adopts an uncritical approach towards the government's policies on most of its 60 daily pages. It is further discussed that its columnists and the debate they initiate are both weak. Then minister of health Ghazi Al Gosaibi's poem written for King Fahd, entitled \"A Pen Bought and Sold\", was published on the front page of the paper in 1984. In the poem, Al Gosaibi indirectly accused the ruling elites, including Prince Sultan, then Minister of Defence, of corruption and Saudi Oger of improper tender activities regarding the public hospitals. King Fahd fired him after reading the poem.\n\nOn 3 and 10 January 2002, a commentary by Muhammad bin Saad al Shuwayir was published in the paper. The commentary was entitled “Why Pork Is Forbidden?”. The author said that the transformation of the Jews into apes and pigs was a punishment “because monkeys and pigs were considered among the lowliest of animals, in nature and manners.” He further stated that Jews always represent the human lowness, as expressed in Quran. Jasser Abdulaziz al Jasser, a columnist of \"Al Jazirah\", criticised Russia, especially Sergey Lavrov, for supporting Assad regime's Alawite minority rule over a Sunni majority in Syria on 24 March 2012. Al Jasser argued that the same tactics used by Russia to oppress Muslim majority in Chechnya and the Caucasus were employed by Assad to oppress Sunni majority in Syria. \"Al Jazirah\"'s front page on 17 June 2012 was entirely in black and white, showing photographs of King Abdullah and late Crown Prince Nayef, who died in Geneva on 16 June 2012.\n\nIn September 2008, a reporter of the paper, Fahd al Jukhaidib, wrote an article in which he described frequent power cuts in Qubba in northern Saudi Arabia. The article also informed the readers about a protest in front of the government-owned electricity company as a result of power cuts experienced. Upon publication of his article, he was sentenced in October 2008 to two months in prison and 50 lashes for inciting the public to protest against a series of electric power reductions. He was free on appeal in 2009.\n\n\"Al Jazirah\" seems not to be conservative in terms of using technology to provide advanced technological platforms to its readers. The paper is the first Saudi daily in launching online website that was formed in 1996. It is also the first daily paper in the Middle East to launch mobile phone application which had more than 50,000 users in 2013. In addition to these technological innovations, \"Al Jazirah\" is also innovative in launching first online women’s daily covering female achievements in Saudi Arabia, latest developments and other topics related to women.\n\nIn 2013, the daily cooperated with Goss International for press upgrade, refurbishment and relocation venture.\n\nList of newspapers in Saudi Arabia\n"}

Wallis as executive producer. The screenplay was adapted by Casey Robinson from the novel by Rachel Field. The music was by Max Steiner and the cinematography by Ernie Haller. The film stars Bette Davis and Charles Boyer with Barbara O'Neil, Jeffrey Lynn, Virginia Weidler, Helen Westley, Walter Hampden, Henry Daniell, Harry Davenport, George Coulouris, Montagu Love, Janet Beecher and June Lockhart.\n\nRachel Field's novel is based on the true story of Field's great-aunt, Henriette Deluzy Desportes, a French governess who fell in love with the Duc de Praslin, her employer. When Praslin's wife, the Duchesse, was murdered, Henriette was implicated. It was a real-life scandal that contributed to the political turmoil before the French Revolution of 1848 which deposed France's Louis Philippe I.\n\nMademoiselle Henriette Deluzy-Desportes (Bette Davis), a French woman, starts teaching at an American girls school. She is confronted by the tales and gossip about her that circulate among her pupils and, thus provoked, she decides to tell them her life story.\n\nDeluzy-Desportes is governess to the four children of the Duc de Praslin (Charles Boyer) and the Duchesse de Praslin (Barbara O'Neil) in Paris during the last years of the Orleans monarchy. As a result of the Duchesse's constantly erratic and temperamental behavior, all that remains is an unhappy marriage, but the Duc remains with his wife for sake of their children.\n\nDeluzy-Desportes. with her warmth and kindness, wins the love and affection of the children and their father, but also the jealousy and hatred of their mother. She is forced to leave and the Duchess refuses to give her a letter of recommendation to future employers. The Duc confronts his wife and she invents alternative letters taking opposite attitudes, which in fact she has not written and does not intend to write. Her account enrages him and, at the breaking point, he kills her.\n\nThe Duc de Praslin is in a privileged position; as a peer his case can only be heard by other nobles. He refuses to confess his guilt or openly to admit his love for Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, knowing that his fellow nobles wish to use such an admission to blame her for the murder by declaring that he was acting at her bidding. Ultimately the Duc takes poison to prevent himself from ever publicly proclaiming his love for Henriette, since he knows that would convict her; however, he lives long enough to reveal it to another of his servants, Pierre (Harry Davenport), a kindly old man who had warned the governess to leave the de Praslin household. With the Duc's death, the authorities accept that they have no evidence upon which to base a judgment that Henriette solicited the murder and she is released.\n\nDeluzy-Desportes had been recommended for the teaching position \"in the land of the free\" by an American minister, Rev. Henry Field (Jeffrey Lynn), to whom she had expressed a loss of faith while in prison. He proposes marriage, and it is implied that Henriette will accept.\n\n\nThe film was positively reviewed by critics. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote that film-goers willing to sit through the long running time \"will find the film a source of much emotional satisfaction; others of less Spartan stamp will certainly protest that it wears out their patience in the telling of a comparatively uncomplicated tale. For the Warners are here handing out a tear-laden old-fashioned drama—and a very heavy one, too.\"\n\n\"Variety\" called it \"film theatre at its best ... Casey Robinson in the scripting captured the quaintness of the manners and customs of Paris, in 1848, and succeeded admirably in retaining both spirit and characters of the novel, despite the necessity for much deletion of material.\" \"Film Daily\"'s headline announced: \"Dramatically powerful, beautifully mounted and superbly cast; film should be one of year's strongest box-office attractions.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" wrote: \"A powerful drama, with a strong appeal for women. The production is lavish, and the direction and performances are of the highest order.\" John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that Litvak had swung the viewer into the historical setting \"with all the romantic, profuse gusto at his command. I think a few of the scenes of governess and children might have been elided, for, with the sinister doings in the background, we can't forever sustain a nursery mood. In general, though, the long picture seems short, which, of course, is something very much in its favor.\"\n\n\"All This, and Heaven Too\" placed fifth on \"Film Daily\"'s year-end nationwide poll of 546 critics naming the best films of 1940.\n\nA successful, but expensive costume drama, it was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Picture; O'Neil was nominated for Best Supporting Actress; and Ernest Haller for Best Cinematography.\n\n"}

Other features include such things as ratings of the cafeterias at scientific institutes, fake classifieds and advertisements for a medical plan called HMO-NO, and a very odd letters page. The magazine is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n\"AIR\" awards the annual science Ig Nobel Prizes, for ten achievements that \"first make people laugh, and then make them think\". \"AIR\" also runs the Luxuriant Flowing Hair Club for Scientists.\n\n\"AIR\" is not the first science parody magazine. The \"Journal of Irreproducible Results\" (\"JIR\") was founded by Alex Kohn and Harry Lipkin in 1955, but most of its editorial staff, including editor Marc Abrahams, left after the magazine was bought by publisher George Scherr in 1994. Scherr filed a number of court actions against \"AIR\", alleging that it was deceptively similar to the \"Journal\" and that it had stolen the name \"Ig Nobel Prize\", but these actions were unsuccessful.\n\nOccasional \"AIR\" articles are factual and illuminating, if a bit offbeat. For example, in 2003 researcher-documentary producer Nick T. Spark wrote about the background and history of Murphy's Law in a four-part article, \"Why Everything You know About Murphy's Law is Wrong\". It was revised, expanded and later published in June 2006 as the book \"A History of Murphy's Law\". Another example: it was scientifically proved and waggishly reported that instruments can distinguish shit from Shinola.\n"}

For much of that time, his program, \"The Art of Jazz,\" aired on FM radio stations in New Jersey and was heard throughout the New York metropolitan area. Vincent was known for his smooth, resonant voice and encyclopedic knowledge of jazz. He championed jazz as a unique American art form on a par with western classical music.\n\nA popular part of Vincent's radio broadcasts were his interviews with jazz greats, including Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Ray Charles, Roy Eldridge, Duke Ellington, Tal Farlow, Art Farmer, Dizzie Gillespie, Jimmy Hamilton, Woody Herman, Richard \"Groove\" Holmes, Kenyon Hopkins, Stan Kenton, Gerry Mulligan, Peter Nero, Anita O'Day, Houston Person, Arthur Prysock, Lou Rawls, Don Sebesky, Jimmy Smith, Maxine Sullivan, Dr. Billy Taylor, Cal Tjader, Dinah Washington - and many others.\n\nIn 1956, Art Vincent developed the engineering plans for radio station WFHA. He and the station manager built WFHA from the ground up, completing it in 1959. Vincent became the station's chief engineer. Around 1960, Vincent hosted his first broadcast on WFHA, a short-lived country music show. In 1961 he debuted his show, \"The Art of Jazz.\"\n\nVincent broadcast a wide range of jazz recordings, from obscure to popular, including all genres, such as blues, Dixieland, manouche, bebop, contemporary, avant garde, etc. His shows often included contests and topical call-in segments. Jazz musicians were frequent in-studio guests, and Vincent would often play interviews he had recorded on-location. Through this rich and varied format, he strove to give his audience a quality listening experience.\n\nVincent was a maverick, refusing to follow some of the commercial broadcasting conventions of his day. He wouldn't speak over the beginning or end of a track, as was the norm for most DJs of the time. He would play several tracks in sequence, talk-free and without commercials. He declined to use management-endorsed playlists, instead developing unique playlists for each broadcast, based on his personal taste and feedback from listeners and musicians.\n\nIn 1967 Vincent moved his show to WJLK and then to WRLB in 1969. He was popular in the NY area jazz community, and developed close relationships with fans and musicians alike. In 1972, he was a guest on the WOR television program, \"The Joe Franklin Show,\" along with flutist Bobbi Humphrey. Vincent also appeared on the Franklin show in the late 1960s or early 1970s, with his longtime friend, guitarist Tal Farlow. Additionally, Farlow composed theme music for the \"Art of Jazz,\" writing two iterations of the theme: \"Blue Art\" and \"Blue Art, Too.\" Farlow released the latter version on LP in 1981, much to the delight of Vincent and his fans.\n\nThroughout his career, Vincent served as master of ceremonies for jazz concerts in New Jersey and elsewhere. In 1972, he was instrumental in starting what became a long-running jazz performance series at the Monmouth County Library in New Jersey. Vincent proposed the idea, and worked with library management to plan the first jazz concerts held in a U.S. public library reading room. He served as MC for the initial three years of the series. Vincent also produced dozens of jazz concerts, at various venues, featuring performers such as Ruth Brown, Tal Farlow, Jimmy Heath, Etta Jones, Hank Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Ray Nance, Zoot Simms, Grady Tate, Teddy Wilson and other top players. (Vincent can be heard as MC on the final track of guitarist Eddie Hazell's 1976 album \"Take Your Shoes Off, Baby.\") In the mid 1970s, with friends and colleagues, he started the AOJ & Company, a non-profit organization devoted to the promotion of jazz through live concerts, lectures and member networking.\n\nIn 1979 the \"Art of Jazz\" show moved to NPR affiliate WBGO. That same year, Vincent was heard on NPR hosting the EBU's French Jazz Festival (and again in 1981). In 1980, Vincent co-hosted the \"Kool Jazz Festival\" on NPR, live from Gracie Mansion in New York City. For the 1980-81 Golden Apple Awards, NYC Jazz Magazine readers nominated Vincent as the best DJ in the local jazz community. Vincent left WBGO in 1981, but continued to be active in the New York area jazz scene. In the mid-1980s he was heard on WBJB.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Vincent recorded a series of jazz musician interviews for Florida-based \"Backstage America,\" a nationally syndicated program of arts-related news and commentary. Vincent's 15 minute \"Jazzcast\" segments were heard on radio stations in 17 states. He interviewed over 75 musicians for this series, including Toshiko Akiyoshi, Betty Carter, Buck Clayton, Panama Francis, Chico Hamilton, Milt Hinton, Clifford Jordan, Branford Marsalis, David \"Fathead\" Newman, and Sun Ra, to name a few.\n\nVincent's radio show received a mention in Batt Johnson's book, \"What is This Thing Called Jazz?\" (iUniverse, 2000). Part of Vincent's 1973 interview with bassist Gene Ramey is quoted in Richard Lawn's textbook, \"Experiencing Jazz\" (McGraw-Hill, 2006; Routledge, 2nd ed. 2012).\n\nArt Vincent wrote the liner notes for several jazz albums, including:\n"}

She is considered by many Peruvians referring to the perfect music to \"drown the sorrows\". Obituaries recognized the sharp tone of her voice, her particular interpretation and the accompaniment of the accordion of Víctor Lara.\n\nShe began her first steps as an amateur singer at age 15, on several radio stations in Lima, but professionally at age 18. Doña Julia and Don Víctor met in 1948, in Miraflores, when she was looking for a piano teacher. Since then, he stayed with her. Víctor Lara was the one who came to baptize her with the pseudonym Carmencita Lara. At the moment that she had to register in a dependency of the state, Julia wanted to do it with the pseudonym of July García. The official replied that they did not register foreign artists there, implying that she did not like the name. Victor told Julia: - \"Put Carmencita just like my mom and we complete with Lara\".\n\nShe went through all the radio stations looking for an opportunity, until the first contract arrived. The contract was made with[Radio Excelsior, on 2 June 1955. The owner of the radio station had listened to her in a restaurant located next to the Plaza de Armas where she went to sing. Her first recording was \"Olvídala amigo\", composition of the iqueño Luis R. Cueto, and of whom don Víctor was the one of the idea to record it. For this they used an accordion, cajón and double bass accompaniment instruments. This at the beginning of the 60s in a studio by the guitarist, Óscar Avilés.\n\nFrom there they came, \"Llora, llora corazón\", \"Indio\" by Alicia Maguiña, singer-songwriter and researcher, who has always highlighted the value of Carmencita for the popular culture. Other tracks she recorded: \"Clavel Marchito\" by Armando Gonzáles, \"Milagro\" by Augusto Rojas Llerena and \"El Árbol de mi casa\" by Salvador Oda.\n\nThe couple of artists made a series of contributions to Peruvian music. She ended the stigma that the criollos do not sing huaynos. She was an innovator of the Peruvian waltz, not only in her way of interpreting it but also in the instrumental accompaniment she had. Don Víctor Lara, contributed incorporating for the first time the sound of the accordion and the battery in the Peruvian waltz. In addition, she devised the successful formula of fusing the female voice with the harp. She used \"¡Llora cholo, llora y sufre!\" as the lema in the beginnings of the concerts.\n\n"}

It was directed by Ph. Carli and starred Annie Krohn, Sylvain Boekebinder, Vally Lank, and Jan Kruyt. The film follows a man and his mistress who reunite after their son and step-daughter unwittingly fall in love. The black-and-white film, which may now be lost, was tinted different colours for certain scenes. It was released in early 1930 to commercial success, although critical opinion was mixed.\n\nVan Kempen is a supervisor at a tea plantation named Ciranu in West Java. He keeps a mistress, or \"njai\", named Siti. Together they have two children, Adolf and Annie. One day, van Kempen returns to the Netherlands, leaving Siti and their young mixed-race children behind. In the Netherlands he marries a young widow and takes her daughter, Ervine, as his step-daughter. Siti, meanwhile, lives with her uncle in a hut in the forest and prays fervently for van Kempen's return, even asking for help from the local shaman (\"dukun\").\n\nFifteen years later, after his wife dies, van Kempen and Ervine return to the Indies. He has been hired as a supervisor at another plantation, not far from his old place of work. He searches for Siti and the couple's children, but none of his old coworkers know where they are. Unbeknownst to van Kempen, his children have been raised as natives and wear the traditional clothes, although they have also received a Western education. Adolf has become a hunter, while Annie stays at home with their mother.\nFrederick, the new manager at Ciranu, has meanwhile fallen for Ervine and tries unsuccessfully to woo her.\n\nSome time afterwards, as Ervine is wandering through the woods she stumbles upon a deer and, startled, faints. Adolf comes across her and brings her back to the plantation, where van Kempen recognises him and takes him on as a supervisor. Frederick, however, is jealous of Adolf and Ervine's relationship and entices the workers at van Kempen's plantation to go on strike until Adolf is fired. Although heartbroken, van Kempen must fire his son.\n\nAdolf goes to Lampung, in Sumatra, to hunt elephants. Meanwhile, Frederick has begun wooing Annie, who rejects him as Ervine did before. When Adolf returns and hears of the supervisor's actions, he fights Frederick and knocks him out. Ervine, meanwhile, has heard that her lover has returned and goes to the hut in the woods, nearly fainting after being caught in a downpour. Adolf sends a letter to van Kempen telling him where to find Ervine. The family are reunited.\n\n\"De Stem des Bloeds\" was directed by Ph. \"Flip\" Carli, a man of mixed Indonesian-European descent who had previously made several documentaries. He targeted the film at Dutch audiences, which may account for the focus on native customs and farming; such coverage was unusual for contemporary works of fiction, although documentaries had handled the subject before. His production house, which handled the film, was the Bandung-based Kinowerk Carli; some contemporary reviews erroneously gave the house's name as Cosmos Film.\n\nProduction began in late 1929 or early 1930, with scenes shot in West Java and Sumatra. \"De Stem Des Bloed\" starred Annie Krohn, Carli's mixed-race wife, as Annie as well as Sylvain Boekebinder (van Kempen), Vally Lank, and Jan Kruyt. The story was advertised as being adapted from the novel of the same name.\n\nLike all contemporary films produced in the Indies, \"De Stem des Bloeds\" had low production values. The film was silent and in black-and-white; the final production consisted of 3,652 meters of film. The intertitles were in Dutch, which the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran notes that most viewers – those who were native or ethnic Chinese – were unable to read. In order to provide a semblance of colour, Carli tinted certain scenes entirely in one shade during post-production; for instance, a scene where farmers were gathering rice was tinted violet.\n\n\"De Stem des Bloeds\" was released in 1930, seeing its Batavia (now Jakarta) premiere on 22 March of that year. By July it was being screened in Surabaya, East Java. It was reported to be a success, with native audiences filling the theatres in Batavia and Surabaya.\n\nThe film received mixed critical reception. An anonymous review in the Batavia-based \"Doenia Film\" praised the film's picture (especially its colour) and both Krohn and Boekebinder's acting. A review in the Surabaya-based \"De Indiesche Courant\" likewise praised the film, stating that it \"fascinates from beginning to end\" and showed that even in the Indies a \"grand\" film could be made. However, the review criticised the censorship bureau's failure to catch scenes of Frederick drinking alcohol, which the reviewer found \"dangerous to the prestige [of Dutchmen]\" considering the large native audiences. Kwee Tek Hoay, writing in \"Panorama\", criticised the film extensively, writing that it seemed meant exclusively for Dutch audiences in the Netherlands, as those living in the Indies would be able to see it did not reflect reality and was in places illogical. He found the colouring one extension of this lack of logic, writing that a violet tinge indicated that the farmers were harvesting rice at sunset – something that never happened.\n\nCarli went on to make two more films starring Krohn. The first, \"Sarinah\" (1931), was a romance set on the south coast of Java which had Krohn in the titular role. The second, \"Karina's Zelfopoffering\" (\"Karina's Sacrifice\"), followed the following year; this film saw Krohn play a mixed-raced woman living at the palace in the Sultanate of Yogyakarta. \"Karina's Zelfopoffering\" was a commercial failure and Carli left the Indies not long afterwards, moving to the Netherlands. He lived there until his death in 1972.\n\nWriting in 2009, Biran suggests that \"De Stem des Bloeds\" was clearly written from an Indo point of view because of the positive roles of Indo children. He finds the film sympathetic to native culture, including the faithful \"njai\". He notes with interest that, although in real life mixed-race children were faced with a sense of disgust, in \"De Stem des Bloeds\" an Indo man is heroic enough to rescue a pure Dutch woman and fight with a Dutchman.\n\nThe film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" (\"Indonesian Film Catalogue\") records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.\n"}

{"id": "1440907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1440907", "title": "Erotic photography", "text": "Erotic photography\n\nErotic photography is a style of art photography of an erotic, sexually suggestive or sexually provocative nature. \n\nAfter the 1960s erotic photography began to be less commonly referred to as such, and to be increasingly described as glamour photography.\n\nErotic photography generally produces a composed image of a subject in a still position. Though the subjects of erotic photography are usually completely or mostly unclothed, that is not a requirement. \n\nErotic photography should be distinguished from nude photography, which contains nude subjects not necessarily in an erotic situation, and pornographic photography, which is of a sexually explicit nature. Pornographic photography generally does not claim any artistic or aesthetic merit.\n\nErotic photographs are normally intended for commercial use, including mass-produced items such as decorative calendars, pinups and for men's magazines, such as \"Penthouse\" and \"Playboy\", but sometimes the photographs are intended to be seen only by a subject's partner. \n\nThe subjects of erotic photographs may be professional models, celebrities or amateurs. Very few well-known entertainers have posed nude for photographs. The first entertainer to pose nude for photographs was the stage actress Adah Isaacs Menken (1835–1868). On the other hand, a number of well-known film stars have posed for pinup girl photographs and been promoted in photography and other media as sex symbols. Traditionally, the subjects of erotic photographs have been female, but since the 1970s erotic images of men have also been published.\n\nBefore 1839, depictions of nudity and erotica generally consisted of paintings, drawings and engravings. In that year, Louis Daguerre presented the first practical process of photography to the French Academy of Sciences. Unlike earlier photograph methods, his daguerreotypes had stunning quality and did not fade with time. Artists adopted the new technology as a new way to depict the nude form, which in practice was the feminine form. In so doing, at least initially, they tried to follow the styles and traditions of the art form. Traditionally, in France, an académie was a nude study done by a painter to master the female (or male) form. Each had to be registered with the French government and approved or they could not be sold. Soon, nude photographs were being registered as académie and marketed as aids to painters. However, the realism of a photograph as opposed to the idealism of a painting made many of these intrinsically erotic.\n\nIn \"Nude Photography, 1840–1920\", Peter Marshall notes: \"In the prevailing moral climate at the time of the invention of photography, the only officially sanctioned photography of the body was for the production of artist's studies. Many of the surviving examples of daguerreotypes are clearly not in this genre but have a sensuality that clearly implies they were designed as erotic or pornographic images\".\n\nThe daguerreotypes were not without drawbacks, however. The main difficulty was that they could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use negatives. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for portraiture. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Another limitation was the monochrome image that the technology could produce. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one of two or more people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her genitals. The cost of the process also limited the spread of the technology. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society. \n\nStereoscopy was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes, including the erotic images. This technology produced a type of three dimensional view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than ₤GB 10,000.\nIn 1841, William Fox Talbot patented the calotype process, the first negative-positive process, making possible multiple copies. This invention permitted an almost limitless number of prints to be produced from a glass negative. The technology also reduced the exposure time and made possible a true mass market for low cost commercial photography. The technology was immediately employed to reproduce nude portraits, classified by the standards of the time as pornographic. Paris soon became the centre of this trade. In 1848 only thirteen photography studios existed in Paris; by 1860, there were over 400. Most of them made income from the sale of illicit nude images to the masses who could now afford it. The pictures were also sold near train stations, by traveling salesmen and women in the streets who hid them under their dresses. They were often produced in sets (of four, eight or twelve), and exported internationally, mainly to England and the United States. Both the models and the photographers were commonly from the working class, and the artistic model excuse was increasingly hard to use. By 1855, no more photographic nudes were being registered as académie, and the business had gone underground to escape prosecution.\nThe Victorian pornographic tradition in Britain had three main elements: French photographs, erotic prints (sold in shops in Holywell Street, a long vanished London thoroughfare, swept away by the Aldwych), and printed literature. The ability to reproduce photographs in bulk assisted the rise of a new business individual, the porn dealer. Many of these dealers used the postal system to distribute erotic photography, sending the photographic cards to subscribers in plain wrappings. Victorian pornography had several defining characteristics. It reflected a very mechanistic view of the human anatomy and its functions. Science, the new obsession, was invoked to ostensibly study the nude human body. Consequently, the sexuality of the subject is often depersonalised, and is without any passion or tenderness. At this time, it also became popular to depict nude photographs of women of exotic ethnicities, under the umbrella of science. \n\nStudies of this type can be found in the work of Eadweard Muybridge. Although he photographed both men and women, the women were often given props like market baskets and fishing poles, making the images of women thinly disguised erotica. \n\nParallel to the British printing history, photographers and printers in France frequently turned to the medium of postcards, producing great numbers of them. Such cards came to be known in the US as \"French postcards\".\n\nThe initial appearance of picture postcards (and the enthusiasm with which the new medium was embraced) raised some legal issues that can be seen as precursors to later controversies over the Internet. Picture postcards allowed and encouraged many individuals to send images across national borders, and the legal availability of a postcard image in one country did not guarantee that the card would be considered \"proper\" in the destination country, or in the intermediate countries that the card would have to pass through. Some countries refused to handle postcards containing sexual references (such as of seaside scenes) or images of full or partial nudity (including images of classical statuary or paintings). Many French postcards featured naked women in erotic poses. These were described as postcards but whose primary purpose was not for sending by post because they would have been banned from delivery. Street dealers, tobacco shops, and a variety of other vendors bought the photographs for resale to tourists. The sale of erotica was banned, and many of these postcards were sold \"under the counter\".\n\nInstead, nude and erotic photographs were marketed in a monthly magazine called \"La Beauté\" that was ostensibly targeted for artists looking for poses. Each issue contained 75 nude images which could be ordered by mail, in the form of postcards, hand-tinted or sepia toned.\n\nThe early 1900s saw several important improvements in camera design, including the 1913 invention of the 35 mm or \"candid\" camera by Oskar Barnack of the Ernst Leitz company. The Ur-Leica was a compact camera based on the idea of reducing the format of negatives and enlarging them later, after they had been exposed. This small, portable device made nude photography in secluded parks and other semi-public places easier, and represented a great advance for amateur erotica. Artists were enamored with their new ability to take impromptu photos without carrying around a clunky apparatus.\n\nEarly 20th century artist E. J. Bellocq, who made his best known images with the older style glass plate negatives, is best remembered for his down-to-earth pictures of prostitutes in domestic settings in the Storyville red light district of New Orleans. In contrast to the usual pictures of women awkwardly posed amid drapery, veils, flowers, fruit, classical columns and oriental braziers, Bellocq's sitters appear relaxed and comfortable. David Steinberg speculates that the prostitutes may have felt at ease with Bellocq because he was \"so much of a fellow outcast.\"\n\nOther photographers of nude women of this period include Alexandre-Jacques Chantron, Jean Agélou and Alfred Cheney Johnston. Chantron was already an established painter before experimenting with photography, while Agélou and Johnston made their career in photography.\n\nJulian Mandel (possibly a pseudonym) became known in the 1920s and 1930s for his exceptional photographs of the female form. Participating in the German \"new age outdoor movement,\" Mandel took numerous pictures in natural settings, publishing them through the Paris-based studios of Alfred Noyer and P-C Paris, Les Studios and the Neue Photographische Gesellschaft. The models often are found in highly arranged classical poses, photographed both in-studio and outdoors. The images are composed artfully, with exquisite tones and soft use of lighting—showing a particular texture created by light rather than shadow.\n\nAnother noteworthy photographer of the first two decades of the 20th century was the naturist photographer Arundel Holmes Nicholls (1923-2008). His work, featured in the archives of the Kinsey Institute, is artistically composed, often giving an iridescent glow to his figures. Following in Mandel's footsteps, Nicholls favored outdoor shots.\n\nMany photographs from this era were intentionally damaged. Bellocq, for instance, frequently scratched out the faces of his sitters to obscure their identities. Some of his other sitters were photographed wearing masks. Peter Marshall writes, \"Even in the relatively bohemian atmosphere of Carmel, California in the 1920s and '30s, Edward Weston had to photograph many of his models without showing their faces, and some 75 years on, many communities are less open about such things than Carmel was then.\"\n\nNude photographers of the mid-20th century include Walter Bird, John Everard, Horace Roye, Harrison Marks and Zoltán Glass. Roye's photograph \",\" depicting a model wearing a gas mask while on a crucifix caused much controversy when published in the English Press in 1938. The image is now considered one of the major pre-war photographs of the 20th century.\nDuring the Second World War, pin-up girl photographs reached a wide audience. Unlike earlier erotic photographs, whose subjects were usually anonymous, a number of well-known film stars posed for pin-up photographs and they were promoted as sex symbols. The emphasis was initially on bare legs, short skirts or swim suits and shapely figures; but in the 1950s such photos started to show naked breasts. \n\"Playboy\" magazine, founded in 1953, achieved great popularity and soon established the market for men's and lifestyle magazines. Erotic photography soon became closely associated with it and gained increasing public attention. \n\nFounded in 1965, \"Penthouse\" magazine went a step further than \"Playboy\" and was the first to clearly display genitals, initially covered with pubic hair. The models looked usually directly into the camera, as if they would enter into relationship with the mostly male viewers. \nIn the 1970s, in the mood of feminism, gender equality and light humour, magazines such as \"Cleo\" included male nude centrefolds. \n\nUnlike the traditional erotic photographs, which use any attractive female subjects, the male nude photographs are usually of celebrities.\nThe spread of the Internet in the 1990s and increasing social liberalization brought a renewed upsurge of erotic photography. There are a variety of print and online publications, which now compete against the major magazines (\"Playboy\", \"Penthouse\") and cater for the diverse tastes. There are a large number of online erotic photography sites, some of which describe themselves or are so described by others as pornography. Where the subject is presented in a romantic or sexually alluring manner, it may be described as glamour photography.\n\n"}

The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.\n\nThe family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, \"The Life of Larry\" and \"Larry & Steve\". MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of \"Family Guy\" had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim aired that episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.\n\nMacFarlane co-created—alongside Mike Henry and Richard Appel—the \"Family Guy\" spin-off \"The Cleveland Show\", which premiered September 27, 2009. They began discussing the project in 2007. Appel and Henry served as the show's executive producers and showrunners, handling the day-to-day operations, with limited involvement from MacFarlane. Henry and Appel conceived the show as \"more of a family show, a sweeter show\" than \"Family Guy\". The first season consisted of 22 episodes, and the show was picked up by Fox for a second season, which consisted of 13 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009, before the first season began. It was extended to a full second season. Appel signed a new three-year, seven-figure deal with Fox to continue serving as showrunner on \"The Cleveland Show\" in 2010. Fox chairman Gary Newman commented: \"What is special about him is his incredible leadership ability.\" The show follows the \"Family Guy\" character Cleveland Brown, who is voiced by Henry, as he leaves the town of Quahog and moves with his son to start his own adventure.\n\nFox canceled \"The Cleveland Show\" on May 13, 2013, roughly a week before the May 19 conclusion of its fourth season. On July 16, 2013, MacFarlane confirmed an upcoming twelfth season episode of \"Family Guy\" centering on Cleveland's return to Quahog.\n\nAn event known as \"Night of the Hurricane\" depicts a hurricane hitting the hometowns of MacFarlane's sitcoms \"Family Guy\", \"American Dad!\" and \"The Cleveland Show\", culminating in a stand-off among the three fathers of each family.\n\nIt was announced that a special episode of \"Family Guy\" featuring an official crossover with \"The Simpsons\" would premiere in 2014. At San Diego Comic Con a 5-minute preview was shown. The episode, titled \"The Simpsons Guy\", was aired September 28, 2014.\n\nThe series may crossover with MacFarlane's other series, \"The Orville\".\n\nAs of 2009, six books have been released about the \"Family Guy\" universe, all published by HarperCollins since 2005. The first, \"\" () by Steve Callahan, was released in April 26, 2005. Written in the style of a graphic novel, the plot follows Stewie's plans to rule the world. Other books include \"\" (), which covers the events of the episode \"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\"; and \"Family Guy and Philosophy: A Cure for the Petarded\" (), a collection of 17 essays exploring the connections between the series and historical philosophers. A book written from Brian's point of view (written by Andrew Goldberg) was published in 2006, called \"Brian Griffin's Guide to Booze, Broads and the Lost Art of Being a Man\".\n\n\"Family Guy\" has been commercially successful in the home market. The show was the first to be resurrected because of high DVD sales. The first volume, covering the show's first two seasons, sold 1.67 million units, topping TV DVD sales in 2003, while the second volume sold another million units. Volumes six and seven debuted at fifth place in United States DVD sales; volume seven was the highest-selling television DVD, selling 171,000 units by June 21, 2009. \"Family Guy Presents Blue Harvest\", the DVD featuring the \"Star Wars\" special \"Blue Harvest\", was released on January 15, 2008, and premiered at the top of United States DVD sales. The DVD was the first \"Family Guy\" DVD to include a digital copy for download to the iPod. In 2004, the first series of \"Family Guy\" toy figurines was released by Mezco Toyz; each member of the Griffin family had their own toy, with the exception of Stewie, of whom two different figures were made. Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures were released, with various forms of Peter. In 2008, the character Peter appeared in advertisements for Subway Restaurants, promoting the restaurant's massive feast sandwich.\n\nFamily Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One was written by executive story editor Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and actress Alex Borstein. The book was first published on May 8, 2007. The book is a biographical monologue by Lois Griffin discussing her memories of growing up and to her attempted run for mayor in the town of Quahog. Though the book primarily consists of a loose narrative monologue by Lois, it is also interspersed with sections from other characters such as Peter Griffin. The book covers events featured in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\", with which it shares a title. It was published in the United Kingdom in 2007 by Orion Books.\n\nA comic book based on the \"Family Guy\" universe was produced. Published by Titan Comics, edited by Steve White and illustrated by Anthony Williams and S. L. Gallant. The writing and the illustrations will be supervised by the show's producers. The first comic book was released on July 27, 2011.\n\nInside Family Guy will be released in May 2019, as part of the series' 20th anniversary.\n\nAs promotion for the show, and, as Newman described, \"[to] expand interest in the show beyond its diehard fans\", Fox organized four \"Family Guy Live!\" performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud. The cast also performed musical numbers from the \"\" comedy album. The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 Montreal Comedy Festival. The \"Family Guy Live!\" performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each.\n\nIn 2007, at the 59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, MacFarlane performed (as the digitally inserted Stewie and Brian) the ceremony's opening number. He performed a song insulting modern television to the tune of the song \"The Fellas At The Freakin' F.C.C.\" performed in the episode \"PTV\". The song insulted TV shows such as \"Two and a Half Men\", \"Desperate Housewives\", and \"Scrubs\", as well as the final scene of \"The Sopranos\".\n\nIn 2009, a special televised performance show aired entitled \"Family Guy Presents Seth & Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show\", in which voice actors Alex Borstein and MacFarlane performed songs from the show, as well as a parody of Lady Gaga's song \"Poker Face\" in the voice of Marlee Matlin, who appeared on stage as a guest during the performance. Some new animated gags also appeared in the show.\n\nOn July 22, 2007, in an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", MacFarlane announced that he may start working on a feature film, although \"nothing's official.\" In \"TV Week\" on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released \"Family Guy\" feature film sometime \"within the next year.\" He came up with an idea for the story, \"something that you could not do on the show, which [to him] is the only reason to do a movie.\" He later went to say he imagines the film to be \"an old-style musical with dialogue\" similar to \"The Sound of Music\", saying that he would \"really be trying to capture, musically, that feel.\" On October 13, 2011, Seth MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a \"Family Guy\" film had been made, and that it would be written by himself and series co-producer Ricky Blitt.\n\nOn November 30, 2012, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a \"Family Guy\" film. The project was put on hold while MacFarlane worked on \"Ted 2\".\n\nOn August 10, 2018, Fox announced that a live-action/animated film based off the series is in development\n\nThe \"Family Guy Video Game!\" is a 2006 action game released by 2K Games and developed by High Voltage Software. The game received mixed reviews, averaging 50% favorable reviews for the PlayStation 2 version, 51% for the PlayStation Portable version, and 53% for the Xbox version, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game received praise for its humor, but was criticized for its short playtime and \"uninteresting gameplay\". On November 2, 2009, IGN journalist Ryan Langley reported the production of a \"Family Guy\"-based party game for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii. He cited the LinkedIn profiles of former HB Studios developer Chris Kolmatycki and Invisible Entertainment co-owner Ron Doucet, which stated that the individuals had worked on the game. MacFarlane recorded exclusive material of Peter's voice and other \"Family Guy\" characters for a 2007 pinball machine of the show by Stern Pinball.\n\nA game called \"Family Guy Online\" was launched into public beta in April 2012, but permanently shut down on January 18, 2013.\n\n\"\", which is centered around the episode \"Road to the Multiverse\", was released on November 20, 2012.\n\n\"\" launched on iOS and Android on April 10, 2014.\n\n\"Family Guy: Another Freakin Mobile Game\" was released on iOS on April 25, 2017.\n"}

{"id": "5082443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5082443", "title": "Hellboy: The Science of Evil", "text": "Hellboy: The Science of Evil\n\nHellboy: The Science of Evil is a video game adapted from the 2004 \"Hellboy\" film by Guillermo del Toro, based on the comic book character of the same name. It was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable on June 24, 2008 in North America, followed by an August 15 release in Europe and August 22 release in Australia.\n\nAll versions follow the same story line, however the PSP version of the game differs from the Xbox 360 and PlayStation versions. There are 3 playable characters: Hellboy, Abe Sapien, and Liz Sherman. Lobster Johnson was planned to be included as a playable character, voiced by Bruce Campbell, but the DLC was never released. Herman von Klempt (voiced by Jürgen Prochnow) is the game's main villain, along with several of his 'kriegaffen'. The game has online and offline multiplayer co-op for up to 2 players.\n\nThe game was created under the creative direction of both the comic book's creator, Mike Mignola, and the film's director, Guillermo del Toro. Ron Perlman, Selma Blair and Doug Jones reprise their roles from the film as Hellboy, Liz Sherman and Abe Sapien respectively, providing voice-overs.\n\nPlayers control Hellboy in a third-person perspective as they progress through a series of levels broken up into six chapters. Levels consist of separate stages and routes occupied by multiple groups of enemies that differ between chapters. In most cases, all enemies in an area must be defeated in order to move to the next phase of the chapter, with ghostly barriers of smoke blocking paths while foes remain present. To combat opponents, Hellboy uses his stone \"right hand of doom\" for most hand-to-hand combat situations, with heavy and quick attacks that can be mixed together for varied combinations. Foes can eventually be stunned, as indicated with a grey flash. Hellboy also performs other attacks, such as slams and head butts, along with cinematic finishing moves when his opponent is near death. These finishing moves are necessary in the boss fights. As Hellboy defeats his enemies, he receives energy that is stored in his health meter. This energy is used to execute certain grapple moves and to activate \"Hellmode\", where Hellboy's right hand of doom becomes engulfed in flames causing further damage in combat.\n\nAnother weapon that can be used is Hellboy's oversized pistol known as the Samaritan. The weapon fires single shots with up to nine different types of ammunition (certain types are not available on certain levels). While most kinds are for damaging opponents like \"Heavy\", \"Grenade\" and \"Splinter\" ammunition, others can be used during the game's puzzles like \"Ignite\" to light beacons or \"Release\" to destroy cursed vines. Additional types of ammunition like \"Charge\" can only be obtained by defeating certain enemies with a finishing move.\n\nHellboy can pick up various objects on each level to be used as a projectile or weapon such as barrels, hammers, pipes, rocks and even parts of enemies or their own weapons. Some items are used in tasks to progress through levels such as lighting fires or lanterns. Other puzzle elements include certain obstacles like doors and cracked walls that require Hellboy to smash through with his right hand of doom and then pull levers connected to obstructions. Throughout the single player mode, there are collectables in the form of artifacts and lores. These act as additional small details to the story and increase maximum energy capacity for the Hellmode ability.\n\nThe story mode can be played cooperatively with another player, both locally with another controller or online over Xbox Live for the Xbox 360 version and PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 version. The game's host always plays as Hellboy and can save each chapter while the second player has the choice of playing as either Abe Sapien or Liz Sherman, both with their own unique abilities and form of combat such as Abe's array of martial arts moves for combat or Liz's pyrokinesis.\n\nThe plot opens in Romania where Hellboy has been sent to track a crazed witch through an abandoned graveyard inhabited by werewolves and the undead. As he battles the witch, she shapeshifts into a swarm of crows that retreats and takes refuge in the nearby village. When Hellboy arrives, he is ambushed by a Nazi soldier and pushed downhill into the village.\n\nThe action shifts to 25 years earlier in an unknown part of rural Japan where Hellboy has been sent in to investigate reports of paranormal activity. He is quickly attacked by an Oni. It is revealed through an old monk later that the Oni's hostility is because their sacred artifact was stolen by the Nazis, under the command of Herman von Klempt who is seeking to use it for their own gain. After heading into the cliffs, Hellboy spots Klempt but is attacked by one of Herman's Kriegaffe. Their fight continues in an old temple until Herman falls over the cliffs after accidentally being struck by a log thrown by his own minion. Hellboy returns the artifact to the old monk.\n\nThe story continues back in the present in Romania with Hellboy pursuing the witch into the abandoned village, which is filled with the undead and Nazi robots battling one another. In a final battle with the witch in the village church, Hellboy pulls down the giant bell, crushing the witch. This is followed by the collapse of the church itself with Hellboy falling into the underground catacombs, where he finds a group of excavating creatures resembling an Ogdru Hem, also swarming with \"frog monsters\". Eventually Hellboy destroys the foundations of the catacombs, causing it to cave in and knocking him into an abyss.\n\nThe following chapter follows Hellboy on a past mission 40 years ago in the Tunisian desert. He stumbles upon a wounded alien soldier who tells of the Nazis again attempting to gain power. This time they tried to use an alien beast, but failed and even though the alien is contained in a crystal prison, it was controlling the fallen Nazis in an attempt to destroy all life on Earth. Further on another soldier reveals that the beast had followed the alien soldiers to Earth. Hellboy tracks down and battles the giant worm while underground. He leads the worm to the surface and defeats it.\n\nBack in the present day, Hellboy wakes up after washing up on the shores of an unknown part of Eastern Europe. There he finds a giant castle on the cliffside. He tries to send a transmission for backup, but his radio signal overlaps with Herman von Klempt's, alerting each to the other's presence. After making his way further into the castle, Hellboy encounters an undead soldier who tells him the castle was built by the Nazis to carry out their experiments, with Klempt returning to finish his work. Hellboy eventually tracks down Klempt to his laboratory. Klempt releases a giant cyborg mutant to kill Hellboy, but during the battle Klempt's control room catches fire and he is badly burned revealing him to be a robot. After Hellboy and the cyborg continues their battle outside, Klempt's real head appears in a hovering jar. Hellboy grabs Klempt's jar and forces it into the power core on the mutant's back, causing it to explode, throwing Hellboy off the castle and into the ocean. After emerging from the water, Hellboy watches the castle's destruction only to suddenly spot the same swarm of crows the witch turned into leading Hellboy off once again on another mission.\n\nThe game received \"generally unfavorable reviews\" on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. While some critics praised the combat style, most of them complained that the game had repetitive game play and that the graphics weren't up to current console generation standards. TeamXbox stated that if this game had been made for last-gen consoles, it would have fared better, but since it wasn't, it loses the appeal. \"X-Play\" gave it a 1 out of 5, and \"Hardcore Gamer\" gave it 2.5 out of 5\n\n"}
{"id": "51692174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51692174", "title": "Ice hockey in Canada", "text": "Ice hockey in Canada\n\nIce hockey in Canada dates back to the 19th century. The sport is very popular and played year-round and at every level. The modern form of ice hockey began in Canada in the late 19th century, and is widely considered Canada's national pastime, with high levels of participation by children, men and women at various levels of competition.\n\nThe contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in Montreal, where the first indoor hockey game was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day.\n\nBefore the formation of the NHL the first professional ice hockey leagues was the Coloured Hockey League in 1895.\n\nThe Stanley Cup is the oldest trophy in North American sports. Lord Stanley of Preston was appointed by Queen Victoria to be the Governor General of Canada on June 11, 1888. While governor, ice hockey was still just forming in Canada. He first got to see the game of hockey played at Montreal's 1889 Winter Carnival. During the carnival he watched the Montreal Victorias play the Montreal Hockey Club. Since then, he and his family became very involved in the game of ice hockey. His two sons, Arthur and Algernon, convinced their father to donate a trophy that would be considered to be a visible sign of the ice hockey championship, which was a silver bowl inlaid with gold. The trophy was first presented in 1893 and was called the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup. The name of the trophy was later changed to its more famous name, The Stanley Cup.\n\nProfessional teams emerged after 1900. Five cities in the United States and Ontario formed the International Professional Hockey League (IPHL) in 1904. The American-based league was the beginning of professional ice hockey. The IPHL attracted high end Canadian players, depriving Canada of its best players. Although many Canadian amateur teams paid their players under the table, most Canadian hockey associations still stuck to the codes of amateurism. The IPHL ceased after three years, but that was long enough to spark the creation of a Canadian-based professional league, the Ontario Professional Hockey League, in 1908. Though some believe the IHL's short existence was due to lack of spectator interest, the primary reason the league failed was a loss of good players back to Canadian teams that by 1906 played in hockey associations, such as the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association, that allowed professionals to play alongside amateurs. The National Hockey League was formed in 1917.\n\nThe violence of the sport instigated the Ottawa Silver Seven and Montreal Wanderers rivalry of 1907. Newspapers described hockey as a combination of \"brutal butchery\" and \"strenuous spectacle,\" speaking to public perceptions and different ways of experiencing the game. Ideals of respectable, middle-class masculinity and rough, working-class masculinity co-existed within accounts of fast, skilled, rugged, hard-hitting hockey.\n\nDuring the 1920s the Winnipeg's senior hockey league for the 1919-20 season, the Winnipeg Falcons, featuring the Icelandic Canadians, became Canadian national champions and won the 1920 Olympic gold medal in Antwerp for Canada in hockey. With their devotion to Canada in World War I, their integration made this team a symbol of Canadian masculinity, unaffected by the ethnic stereotyping and discrimination that affected some other sports teams during the 1920s.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association was forced to re-evaluate its position on amateurism in ice hockey and to assess its relationship to the amateur sports infrastructure in Canada, which was headed by the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada. The lackluster performance of the Canadian national hockey team at the 1936 Olympics, over player availability forced radcaial changes on approaches to how the game was formulated in the country.\n\nMaurice Richard is considered one of the greatest hockey players Canada has ever produced especially in Quebec. Richard won two Hart Trophies as league MVP, and led the Montreal Canadiens to eight Stanley Cups\n\nIn September 1972, Canada's best hockey players from the National Hockey League (NHL) played the elite amateurs from the Soviet Union in a friendly series. When Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau met his Soviet counterpart, Alexei Kosygin, in 1971, their discussions included increasing the hockey competitions between the two countries. Soon after, hockey hierarchies of both nations decided on a series of eight games, four to be played across Canada and four in Moscow. For Canadians, the Summit Series was intended to be a celebration of their global supremacy in ice hockey. The architects of Soviet hockey, on the other hand, had designs on surprising Canada and the world with their skill and claiming the Canadian game as their own.\n\nProminent trophies for national championships in Canada are the Memorial Cup for the top junior-age men's team and the Allan Cup for the top men's senior team. There are national championships in several other divisions of play. Hockey Canada is the sport's official governing body in Canada and is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). A Canadian national men's team, composed of professionals, competes in the annual IIHF Men's World Championship and in the Olympics. Russia and U.S.A are considered the Canada national team major rival.\n\nIce hockey is one of the most played sports in the country at youth level.\n\nThe sport is facing increaseing competition for youth participation from sports such as Basketball, Soccer,\n\nWomen's hockey in Canada is growing.\n\nIce hockey is so popular it is conflated with Canadian national identity.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16141", "title": "Jazz guitar", "text": "Jazz guitar\n\nThe term jazz guitar may refer to either a type of guitar or to the variety of guitar playing styles used in the various genres which are commonly termed \"jazz\". The jazz-type guitar was born as a result of using electric amplification to increase the volume of conventional acoustic guitars.\n\nConceived in the early 1930s, the electric guitar became a necessity as jazz musicians sought to amplify their sound to be heard over loud big bands. When guitarists in big bands only had acoustic guitars, all they could do was play chords; they could not play solos because the acoustic guitar is not a loud instrument. Once guitarists switched from acoustic guitar to semi-acoustic guitar and began using guitar amplifiers, it made the guitar much easier to hear, which enabled guitarists to play guitar solos. Jazz guitar had an important influence on jazz in the beginning of the twentieth century. Although the earliest guitars used in jazz were acoustic and acoustic guitars are still sometimes used in jazz, most jazz guitarists since the 1940s have performed on an electrically amplified guitar or electric guitar.\n\nTraditionally, jazz electric guitarists use an archtop with a relatively broad hollow sound-box, violin-style f-holes, a \"floating bridge\", and a magnetic pickup. Solid body guitars, mass-produced since the early 1950s, are also used.\n\nJazz guitar playing styles include \"comping\" with jazz chord voicings (and in some cases walking bass lines) and \"blowing\" (improvising) over jazz chord progressions with jazz-style phrasing and ornaments. Comping refers to playing chords underneath a song's melody or another musician's solo improvisations. When jazz guitar players improvise, they may use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression and elements of the tune's melody.\n\nThe stringed, chord-playing rhythm can be heard in groups which included military band-style instruments such as brass, saxes, clarinets, and drums, such as early jazz groups. As the acoustic guitar became a more popular instrument in the early 20th century, guitar-makers began building louder guitars which would be useful in a wider range of settings.\n\nThe Gibson L5, an acoustic archtop guitar which was first produced in 1923, was an early “jazz”-style guitar which was used by early jazz guitarists such as Eddie Lang. By the 1930s, the guitar began to displace the banjo as the primary chordal rhythm instrument in jazz music, because the guitar could be used to voice chords of greater harmonic complexity, and it had a somewhat more muted tone that blended well with the upright bass, which, by this time, had almost completely replaced the tuba as the dominant bass instrument in jazz music.\n\nDuring the late 1930s and through the 1940s—the heyday of big band jazz and swing music—the guitar was an important rhythm section instrument. Some guitarists, such as Freddie Green of Count Basie’s band, developed a guitar-specific style of accompaniment. Few of the big bands, however, featured amplified guitar solos, which were done instead in the small combo context. The most important jazz guitar soloists of this period included the Manouche virtuoso Django Reinhardt, Oscar Moore who was featured with Nat “King” Cole’s trio, and Charlie Christian of Benny Goodman's band and sextet, who was a major influence despite his early death at 25.\n\nIt was not until the large-scale emergence of small combo jazz in the post-WWII period that the guitar took off as a versatile instrument, which was used both in the rhythm section and as a featured melodic instrument and solo improviser. In the hands of George Barnes, Kenny Burrell, Herb Ellis, Barney Kessel, Jimmy Raney, and Tal Farlow, who had absorbed the language of bebop, the guitar began to be seen as a “serious” jazz instrument. Improved electric guitars such as Gibson’s ES-175 (released in 1949), gave players a larger variety of tonal options. In the 1940s through the 1960s, players such as Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, and Jim Hall laid the foundation of what is now known as \"jazz guitar\" playing.\n\nAs jazz-rock fusion emerged in the early 1970s, many players switched to the more rock-oriented solid body guitars. Other jazz guitarists, like Grant Green and Wes Montgomery, turned to applying their skills to pop-oriented styles that fused jazz with soul and R&B, such as soul jazz-styled organ trios. Younger jazz musicians rode the surge of electric popular genres such as blues, rock, and funk to reach new audiences. Guitarists in the fusion realm fused the post-bop harmonic and melodic language of musicians such as John Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Ornette Coleman, and Miles Davis with a hard-edged (and usually very loud) rock tone created by guitarists such as Cream's Eric Clapton who had redefined the sound of the guitar for those unfamiliar with the black blues players of Chicago and, before that, the Delta region of the Mississippi upon whom his style was based. With John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Clapton turned up the volume on a sound already pioneered by Buddy Guy, Freddie King, B.B. King and others that was fluid, with heavy finger vibratos, string bending, and speed through powerful Marshall amplifiers.\n\nFusion players such as John McLaughlin adopted the fluid, powerful sound of rock guitarists such as Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. McLaughlin was a master innovator, incorporating hard jazz with the new sounds of Clapton, Hendrix, Beck and others. McLaughlin later formed the Mahavishnu Orchestra, an historically important fusion band that played to sold out venues in the early 1970s and as a result, produced an endless progeny of fusion guitarist. Guitarists such as Pat Martino, Al Di Meola, Larry Coryell, John Abercrombie, John Scofield and Mike Stern (the latter two both alumni of the Miles Davis band) fashioned a new language for the guitar which introduced jazz to a new generation of fans. Like the rock-blues icons that preceded them, fusion guitarists usually played their solid body instruments through stadium rock-style amplification, and signal processing \"effects\" such as simulated distortion, wah-wah, octave splitters, compression, and flange pedals. They also simply turned up to full volume in order to create natural overdrive such as the blues rock players.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the radical experiments of early 1970s-era fusion gave way to a more radio-friendly sounds of smooth jazz. Guitarist Pat Metheny mixed the sounds of blues, country, and “world” music, along with rock and jazz, playing both a flat-top acoustic guitar and an electric guitar with a softer, more mellow tone which was sweetened with a shimmering effect known as “chorusing\". During the 1980s, a neo-traditional school of jazz sought to reconnect with the past. In keeping with such an aesthetic, young guitarists of this era sought a clean and round tone, and they often played traditional hollow-body arch-top guitars without electronic effects, frequently through vacuum tube amplifiers.\n\nAs players such as Bobby Broom, Peter Bernstein, Howard Alden, Russell Malone, and Mark Whitfield revived the sounds of traditional jazz guitar, there was also a resurgence of archtop luthierie (guitar-making). By the early 1990s many small independent luthiers began making archtop guitars. In the 2000s, jazz guitar playing continues to change. Some guitarists incorporate a Latin jazz influence, acid jazz-style dance club music uses samples from Wes Montgomery, and guitarists such as Bill Frisell continue to defy categorization.\n\n While jazz can be played on any type of guitar, from an acoustic instrument to a solid-bodied electric guitar such as a Fender Stratocaster, the full-depth archtop guitar has become known as the prototypical \"jazz guitar.\" Archtop guitars are steel-string acoustic guitars with a big soundbox, arched top, violin-style f-holes, a \"floating bridge\" and magnetic or piezoelectric pickups. Early makers of jazz guitars included Gibson, Epiphone, D'Angelico and Stromberg. The electric guitar is plugged into a guitar amplifier to make it sound loud enough for performance. Guitar amplifiers have equalizer controls that allow the guitarist to change the tone of the instrument, by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain frequency bands. The use of reverb effects, which are often included in guitar amplifiers, has long been part of the jazz guitar sound. Particularly since the 1970s jazz fusion era, some jazz guitarists have also used effects pedals such as overdrive pedals, chorus pedals and wah pedals.\n\nThe earliest guitars used in jazz were acoustic, later superseded by a typical electric configuration of two humbucking pickups. In the 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest among jazz guitarists in acoustic archtop guitars with floating pickups. The original acoustic archtop guitars were designed to enhance volume: for that reason they were constructed for use with relatively heavy guitar strings. Even after electrification became the norm, jazz guitarists continued to fit strings of 0.012\" gauge or heavier for reasons of tone, and also prefer flatwound strings. The characteristic arched top can be made of a solid piece of wood that is carved into the arched shape, or a piece of laminated wood (essentially a type of plywood) that is pressed into shape. Spruce is often used for tops, and maple for backs. Archtop guitars can be mass-produced, such as the Ibanez Artcore series, or handmade by luthiers such as Robert Benedetto.\n\n\nJazz rhythm guitar often consists of very textural, odd-meter playing that includes generous use of exotic, difficult-to-fret chords. In 4/4 timing, it is common to play 2.5 beat intervals such as on the 2 and then the half beat or \"and\" after 4. Jazz guitarists may play chords \"ahead\" of the beat, by playing the chord a swung eighth note before the actual chord change. Chords are not generally played in a repetitive rhythmic fashion, like a rock rhythm guitarist would play.\n\nJazz guitarists use their knowledge of harmony and jazz theory to create jazz chord \"voicings,\" which emphasize the 3rd and 7th notes of the chord. Some more sophisticated chord voicings also include the 9th, 11th, and 13th notes of the chord. In some modern jazz styles, dominant 7th chords in a tune may contain altered 9ths (either flattened by a semitone, which is called a \"flat 9th\", or sharpened by a semitone, which is called a \"sharp 9th\"); 11ths (sharpened by a semitone, which is called a \"sharp 11th\"); 13ths (typically flattened by a semitone, which is called a \"flat 13th\").\n\nJazz guitarists need to learn about a range of different chords, including major 7th, major 6th, minor 7th, minor/major 7th, dominant 7th, diminished, half-diminished, and augmented chords. As well, they need to learn about chord transformations (e.g., altered chords, such as \"alt dominant chords\" described above), chord substitutions, and re-harmonization techniques. Some jazz guitarists use their knowledge of jazz scales and chords to provide a walking bass-style accompaniment.\n\nJazz guitarists learn to perform these chords over the range of different chord progressions used in jazz, such as the ubiquitous ii-V-I progression, the jazz-style blues progression (which, in contrast to a blues-style 12 bar progression, may have two or more chord changes per bar) the minor jazz-style blues form, the I-vi-ii-V based \"rhythm changes\" progression, and the variety of modulation-rich chord progressions used in jazz ballads, and jazz standards. Guitarists may also learn to use the chord types, strumming styles, and effects pedals (e.g., chorus effect or fuzzbox) used in 1970s-era jazz-Latin, jazz-funk, and jazz-rock fusion music.\n\nJazz guitarists integrate the basic building blocks of scales and arpeggio patterns into balanced rhythmic and melodic phrases that make up a cohesive solo. Jazz guitarists often try to imbue their melodic phrasing with the sense of natural breathing and legato phrasing used by horn players such as saxophone players. As well, a jazz guitarists' solo improvisations have to have a rhythmic drive and \"timefeel\" that creates a sense of \"swing\" and \"groove.\" The most experienced jazz guitarists learn to play with different \"timefeels\" such as playing \"ahead of the beat\" or \"behind the beat,\" to create or release tension.\n\nAnother aspect of the jazz guitar style is the use of stylistically appropriate ornaments, such as grace notes, slides, and muted notes. Each subgenre or era of jazz has different ornaments that are part of the style of that subgenre or era. Jazz guitarists usually learn the appropriate ornamenting styles by listening to prominent recordings from a given style or jazz era. Some jazz guitarists also borrow ornamentation techniques from other jazz instruments, such as Wes Montgomery's borrowing of playing melodies in parallel octaves, which is a jazz piano technique. Jazz guitarists also have to learn how to add in passing tones, use \"guide tones\" and chord tones from the chord progression to structure their improvisations.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, with jazz-rock fusion guitar playing, jazz guitarists incorporated rock guitar soloing approaches, such as riff-based soloing and usage of pentatonic and blues scale patterns. Some guitarists used Jimi Hendrix-influenced distortion and wah-wah effects to get a sustained, heavy tone, or even used rapid-fire guitar shredding techniques, such as tapping and tremolo bar bending. Guitarist Al Di Meola, who started his career with Return to Forever in 1974, was one of the first guitarists to perform in a \"shred\" style, a technique later used in rock and heavy metal playing. Di Meola used alternate-picking to perform very rapid sequences of notes in his solos.\n\nWhen jazz guitar players improvise, they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz guitar. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised \"by ear\" by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play \"by ear.\" Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and piano players, bebop-era jazz guitarists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios. Jazz guitar players tend to improvise around chord/scale relationships, rather than reworking the melody, possibly due to their familiarity with chords resulting from their comping role. A source of melodic ideas for improvisation is transcribing improvised solos from recordings. This provides jazz guitarists with a source of \"licks\", melodic phrases and ideas they incorporate either intact or in variations, and is an established way of learning from the previous generations of players.\n\nIn jazz big bands, popular during the 1930s and 1940s, the guitarist is considered an integral part of the rhythm section (guitar, drums and bass). They usually played a regular four strums to the bar, although an amount of harmonic improvisation is possible. Freddie Green, guitarist in the Count Basie orchestra, was a noted exponent of this style. The harmonies are often minimal; for instance, the root note is often omitted on the assumption that it will be supplied by the bassist.\n\nWhen jazz guitarists play chords underneath a song's melody or another musician's solo improvisations, it is called \"comping\", short for \"accompanying\" The accompanying style in most jazz styles differs from the way chordal instruments accompany in many popular styles of music. In many popular styles of music, such as rock and pop, the rhythm guitarist usually performs the chords in rhythmic fashion which sets out the beat or groove of a tune. In contrast, in many modern jazz styles within smaller, the guitarist plays much more sparsely, intermingling periodic chords and delicate voicings into pauses in the melody or solo, and using periods of silence. Jazz guitarists commonly use a wide variety of inversions when comping, rather than only using standard voicings.\n\nIn this style, the guitarist aims to render an entire song — harmony, melody and bass — in something like the way a classical guitarist or pianist can. Chord roots cannot be left to the bassist in this style. Chords themselves can be used sparsely or more densely, depending on both the individual player and his or her arrangement of a particular piece. In the sparse style, a full chord is often played only at the beginning of a melodic phrase. The denser chordal textures, in contrast, approach chord soloing (see below). A third approach is to maintain a steady, busy bass-line, like a New Orleans pianist. Here, no more than two or three notes are played at a time, and the full harmony is indicated by arpeggiation. Exponents of this style often come from a country, folk or ragtime background, such as Chet Atkins, although it is also sometimes employed by straight-ahead jazz practitioners, for instance Martin Taylor. Chord-melody is often played with a plectrum (see Tal Farlow, George Benson and others); whereas fingerstyle, as practised by Joe Pass, George van Eps, Ted Greene, Robert Conti, Lenny Breau or hybrid picking as practised by Ed Bickert, Laszlo Sirsom and others allows for a more complex, polyphonic approach to unaccompanied soloing.\n\nCharlie Christian and Django Reinhardt are generally held to have initiated the use of the guitar to play melodies and improvisations over other instruments, the former using an early form of amplification, the latter playing forcefully on an acoustic guitar. Over the years, jazz guitarists have been able to solo in standard jazz idioms, such as bebop, cool jazz and so on, while in also absorbing influences from rock guitarists, such as the use of electronic effects.\n\nJazz guitarists are not limited to single note improvisation. When working with accompaniment, chord solos are created by improvising chords (harmony) and melody simultaneously, usually in the upper register on strings 1,2,3 and 4. Wes Montgomery was noted for playing successive choruses in single notes, then octaves and finally a chord solo - this can be heard in his improvisation on the standard Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?). When playing without accompaniment, jazz guitarists may create chord solos by playing bass, melody and chords, individually or simultaneously, on any or all strings - such as the work of Lenny Breau, Joe Pass, Martin Taylor and others. This technique can be also be incorporated into unaccompanied soloing: for instance Django Reinhardt's \"improvisations\", as he called his solo pieces.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The studio operated independently from 1988 until 2000, when it was acquired by Infogrames, who changed the name to Melbourne House. In 2006 the studio was sold to Krome Studios.\n\nThe name Beam was a contraction of the names of the founders: Naomi Besen and Alfred Milgrom.\n\nIn the early years, two of Beam's programs were milestones in their respective genre. \"The Hobbit\", a 1982 text adventure by Philip Mitchell and Veronika Megler, sold more than a million copies. It employed an advanced parser by Stuart Richie and had real-time elements. Even if the player didn't enter commands, the story would move on. In 1985 Greg Barnett's two-player martial arts game \"The Way of the Exploding Fist\" helped define the genre of one-on-one fighting games on the home computer. The game won Best Overall Game at the Golden Joystick Awards.\n\nIn 1988 Beam's publisher, parent company Melbourne House, was sold to Mastertronic for £850,000. Subsequently games were released through varying publishers. The 1988 fighting games and \"Fist +\", the third installment in the Exploding Fist series, were published through Telecomsofts Firebird label. 1988 also saw the release of space-shoot'em-up \"Bedlam\", published by GO!, one of U.S. Gold's labels, and \"The Muncher\", published by Gremlin Graphics.\n\nIn 1987 Nintendo granted a developer's licence for the NES and Beam developed games on that platform for US and Japanese publishers. Targeted at an Australian audience, releases such as \"Aussie Rules Footy\" and \"International Cricket\" for the NES proved successful. In 1992 they released the original title \"Nightshade\", a dark superhero comedy game. The game was meant to be the first part in a series, but no sequels were ever made; however, it served as the basis for \"Shadowrun\".\n\nIn 1993 they released \"Shadowrun\", with an innovative dialogue system using the acquisition of keywords which could be used in subsequent conversations to initiate new branches in the dialogue tree. In 1997, Beam relaunched the Melbourne House brand, under which they published the PC titles \"Krush Kill 'n' Destroy\" (KKND), and the sequels \"KKND Xtreme\" and \"\". They released \"KKND2\" in South Korea well before they released it in the American and European markets, and pirated versions of the game were available on the internet before it was available in stores in the U.S. They were the developers of the 32-bits versions of \"Norse By Norse West: The Return of the Lost Vikings\" for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and PC in 1996. They also helped produce SNES games such as \"WCW SuperBrawl Wrestling\", \"Super Smash TV\" and an updated version of \"International Cricket\" titled \"Super International Cricket\". They ported the Sega Saturn game \"Bug!\" to Windows 3.x in August, 1996.\n\n1998 saw a return to RPGs with \"Alien Earth\", again with a dialogue tree format. Also in 1998, the studio developed racing games \"DethKarz\" and \"GP 500\".\n\nIn 1999 Beam Software was acquired by Infogrames and renamed to Infogrames Melbourne House.\n\nThey continued to cement a reputation as a racing game developer with \"\" and \"\" (both Dreamcast and PlayStation 2), followed by the technically impressive \"Grand Prix Challenge\" (PlayStation 2), before a disastrous venture into third-person shooters with \"\" (PlayStation 2, GameCube).\n\nIn 2004 the studio released \"Transformers\" for the PlayStation 2 games console based on the then current Transformers Armada franchise by Hasbro. The game reached the top of the UK PlayStation 2 games charts, making it Melbourne House's most successful recent title.\n\nThe studio then completed work on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of Eden's next-generation Xbox 360 title \"Test Drive: Unlimited\".\n\nIn December 2005, Atari decided to shift away from internal development, seeking to sell its studios, including Melbourne House. In November 2006 Krome Studios announced that it had acquired Melbourne House from Atari and that the studio would be renamed to Krome Studios Melbourne.\n\n\n\n"}

While the original \"Kung Fu\" series was set in the American old west, \"Kung Fu: The Legend Continues\" was set in modern times. It starred David Carradine and Chris Potter as a father and son trained in kung fu – Carradine playing a Shaolin monk, Potter a police detective. The series aired in syndication for four seasons from January 27, 1993 to January 1, 1997, and was broadcast in over 70 countries. Filming took place in Toronto, Ontario. Reruns of the show have been aired on TNT.\n\nThe show was canceled when its producer, Prime Time Entertainment Network (also known as PTEN), ceased operations and no other producer opted to continue the series.\n\nLike his grandfather and namesake from the original series, Kwai Chang Caine is a Shaolin priest who walked out of the past. Caine was the head of a temple in Northern California, where his son Peter (Nathaniel Moreau, later Robert Bednarski) also lived and studied, until the temple was destroyed in a fire caused by a renegade priest who believed the priests should serve as mercenaries. After the destruction of the temple, each believed the other had perished and went on their separate ways; Caine wandered and traveled, much as his grandfather had, while Peter became a foster child and eventually a police officer. The series begins when Caine comes to fictional Sloanville and ends up in the Chinatown section of town, where Peter's precinct is located, and they are reunited after 15 years.\n\n\n\"Kung Fu: The Legend Continues\" lasted four seasons with a total of 88 episodes. The pilot episode, \"Initiation,\" was presented as a two-parter. It established the main characters and introduced many of the concepts that are seen throughout the series. As with the rest of the series, much of the storytelling was done through flashbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 27, 2014, Warner Bros. released the complete first season on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time in the USA only not Canada, via their Warner Archive Collection. Season 2 was released on August 18, 2015.\n\n\n"}

She is half Irish and half Polish and describes herself as being \"bi-Polish\".\n\nAs a young woman she entered California State University and began training in their police academy program, but decided that law enforcement was not for her when she came to the realization that she may someday have to use a gun. So she decided to try her hand at acting and began her career as an extra in films.\n\nLandon began acting in a bit part in 1979's \"Bitter Heritage\", also released as \"Naked in My Grave\". She was cast as a featured skater in \"Roller Boogie\" in that same year.\n\nShe gained a small role in 1981's \"Full Moon High\", her first of many collaborations with director Larry Cohen. Landon had spent part of her early career as a model and in 1980 was a runner-up in the \"Miss Black Velvet\" pageant in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nWhile there, a casting director told her to go see another casting director in Los Angeles (Rueben Cannon), regarding a feature film called \"...All the Marbles\". As she found modeling boring and was unable to sit still for hours at a time, she took his suggestion. She starred as \"Molly\" in \"...All the Marbles\", a film starring Peter Falk that had an alternate title, \"The California Dolls\". She described this as her most satisfying role. She was chosen as one of the final four women for the role and was required to undergo rigorous training at a professional wrestling school. Even though she broke her foot during the last match of the tryouts, she and Vicki Frederick won their parts over 2,000 other young actresses trying out, including one young actress named Kathleen Turner. The successful film was the last directing effort by Robert Aldrich (whom she famously referred to as Robert Altman upon meeting him for the first time).\n\nLandon went on to play Velda, right-hand woman to private eye Mike Hammer, in the 1982 film \"I, the Jury\".

At age 19, Lipton wrote the poem that became the basis for the lyrics to the song \"Puff the Magic Dragon\". He went on to write books on independent filmmaking and become a pioneer in the field of projected three-dimensional imagery. His technology is used to show 3D films on more than 25,000 theater screens worldwide.\n\nLipton majored in physics at Cornell University after starting out in electrical engineering. A self-described \"mediocre student\", he only excelled once he found a field he loved. Lipton now urges schools to be more \"accepting of eccentric people with a different point of view because we are the people who make the difference.\"\n\nLipton was 19 when he wrote the poem that was adapted into the lyrics for the 1963 song \"Puff the Magic Dragon\", performed by Peter Paul and Mary. His inspiration was a 1936 Ogden Nash poem, \"A Tale of Custard the Dragon\". \"Pirates and dragons, back then, were common interests in stories for boys,\" Lipton said. \"The Puff story is really just a lot like Peter Pan.” Lipton has spent years denying that the song was about marijuana and believes that the myth was created by New York columnist Dorothy Kilgallen.\n\nIn the 1960s, Lipton shot several experimental films on 16 mm stock, most with running times of less than 10 minutes. The best known, \"Let a Thousand Parks Bloom\", a 27-minute film about Berkeley's People's Park, played at the Tate Liverpool Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art. The following decade, he wrote two books on technologies and methods for independent filmmakers: \"The Super 8 Book\" (1975) and \"Independent Film Making\" (1979). \"Lipton on Filmmaking, a\" compendium of his magazine writings, was also published in 1979.\n\nLipton is a pioneer in the field of projected three-dimensional imagery and is one of the creators of the electronic stereoscopic display industry. His interest dates back to his childhood in New York where he attended movie palaces, with some films shown in 3D. He drew his own 3D comics using red and green crayons on tracing paper, which were viewed using primitive glasses constructed of cardboard tubes and magnifying lenses.\n\nRoyalties from \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" and \"Independent Filmmaking\", which remained in print for 20 years, gave Lipton an independent income that allowed him to follow his interests. His career in stereoscopic display began to gel around 1972. In one early stint, he served as the \"convergence setter\" for the 1983 3D film \"Rottweiler: Dogs from Hell\", determining for each shot the optimal distance separating the two camera lenses. Previewing a scene from the film, technical staff from Universal were impressed by the stereoscopic imagery, but little else.\n\nHe built a prototype of a flicker-free, field-sequential 3D display system and founded StereoGraphics Corporation in 1980 to fund development. The system worked by doubling the display rate of images, thereby overcoming a problem inherent in 3D motion picture projection, where each eye views only half the available images. In 1989, he patented the active ZScreen polarization filter that uses a circularly polarized liquid crystal filter placed in front of a projector, which can then display both the left and right halves of a stereo pair. After Real D Cinema acquired StereoGraphics in 2005, the technology became the basis for the RealD cinema system. As of 2017, the system was in use in more than 26,500 screens worldwide. Lipton was the chief technology officer at RealD until 2009, when he left to do independent consulting.\n\nLipton published his definitive treatment of the subject, \"Foundations of the Stereoscopic Cinema: A Study in Depth\", in 1982. In 2011, the International 3D Society gave him its Century Award for Lifetime Achievement. As of 2015, he held 68 stereography-related patents.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "319762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=319762", "title": "Logos", "text": "Logos\n\nLogos (, ; ; from , , ) is a term in Western philosophy, psychology, rhetoric, and religion derived from a Greek word variously meaning \"ground\", \"plea\", \"opinion\", \"expectation\", \"word\", \"speech\", \"account\", \"reason\", \"proportion\", and \"discourse\", but it became a technical term in Western philosophy beginning with Heraclitus (), who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge. \"Logos\" is the logic behind an argument. \"Logos\" tries to persuade an audience using logical arguments and supportive evidence. \"Logos\" is a persuasive technique often used in writing and rhetoric.\n\nAncient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways. The sophists used the term to mean discourse; Aristotle applied the term to refer to \"reasoned discourse\" or \"the argument\" in the field of rhetoric, and considered it one of the three modes of persuasion alongside \"ethos\" and \"pathos\". Stoic philosophers identified the term with the divine animating principle pervading the Universe. Within Hellenistic Judaism, Philo of Alexandria () adopted the term into Jewish philosophy. The Gospel of John identifies the Logos, through which all things are made, as divine (\"theos\"), and further identifies Jesus Christ as the incarnate Logos. The term is also used in Sufism, and the analytical psychology of Carl Jung.\n\nDespite the conventional translation as \"word\", it is not used for a word in the grammatical sense; instead, the term \"lexis\" (, ) was used. However, both \"logos\" and \"lexis\" derive from the same verb (), meaning \"(I) count, tell, say, speak\".\n\nAuthor and Professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes logos as a \"premise\". She states that, to find the reason behind a rhetor's backing of a certain position or stance, one must acknowledge the different \"premises\" that the rhetor applies via his or her chosen diction. The rhetor's success, she argues, will come down to \"certain objects of agreement...between arguer and audience\". \"Logos is logical appeal, and the term logic is derived from it. It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker's topic.\" Furthermore, logos is credited with appealing to the audience's sense of logic, with the definition of \"logic\" being concerned with the thing as it is known.\nFurthermore, one can appeal to this sense of logic in two ways. The first is through inductive reasoning, providing the audience with relevant examples and using them to point back to the overall statement. The second is through deductive enthymeme, providing the audience with general scenarios and then indicating commonalities among them.\n\nPhilo distinguished between \"logos prophorikos\" (\"the uttered word\") and the \"logos endiathetos\" (\"the word remaining within\"). The Stoics also spoke of the \"logos spermatikos\" (the generative principle of the Universe) which foreshadows related concepts in Neoplatonism. Early translators of the Greek New Testament such as Jerome (in the 4th century AD) were frustrated by the inadequacy of any single Latin word to convey the meaning of the word \"Logos\" as used to describe Jesus Christ in the Gospel of John. The Vulgate Bible usage of was thus constrained to use the (perhaps inadequate) noun for \"word\", but later Romance language translations had the advantage of nouns such as in French. Reformation translators took another approach. Martin Luther rejected (verb) in favor of (word), for instance, although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving \"the living word\" as felt by Jerome and Augustine.\n\nThe writing of Heraclitus () was the first place where the word \"logos\" was given special attention in ancient Greek philosophy, although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time. For Heraclitus, \"logos\" provided the link between rational discourse and the world's rational structure.\n\nWhat \"logos\" means here is not certain; it may mean \"reason\" or \"explanation\" in the sense of an objective cosmic law, or it may signify nothing more than \"saying\" or \"wisdom\". Yet, an independent existence of a universal \"logos\" was clearly suggested by Heraclitus.\n\nAristotle identifies two specific types of persuasion methods: artistic and inartistic. He defines artistic proofs as arguments that the rhetor generates and creates on their own. Examples of these include relationships, testimonies, and conjugates. He defines inartistic proofs as arguments that the rhetor quotes using information from a non-self-generated source. Examples of these include laws, contracts, and oaths.\n\nFollowing one of the other meanings of the word, Aristotle gave \"logos\" a different technical definition in the \"Rhetoric\", using it as meaning argument from reason, one of the three modes of persuasion. The other two modes are \"pathos\" (, ), which refers to persuasion by means of emotional appeal, \"putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind\"; and \"ethos\" (, ), persuasion through convincing listeners of one's \"moral character\". According to Aristotle, \"logos\" relates to \"the speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove\". In the words of Paul Rahe:\n\n\"Logos\", \"pathos\", and \"ethos\" can all be appropriate at different times. Arguments from reason (logical arguments) have some advantages, namely that data are (ostensibly) difficult to manipulate, so it is harder to argue against such an argument; and such arguments make the speaker look prepared and knowledgeable to the audience, enhancing \"ethos\". On the other hand, trust in the speaker—built through \"ethos\"—enhances the appeal of arguments from reason.\n\nRobert Wardy suggests that what Aristotle rejects in supporting the use of \"logos\" \"is not emotional appeal per se, but rather emotional appeals that have no 'bearing on the issue', in that the \"pathē\" [, ] they stimulate lack, or at any rate are not shown to possess, any intrinsic connection with the point at issue—as if an advocate were to try to whip an antisemitic audience into a fury because the accused is Jewish; or as if another in drumming up support for a politician were to exploit his listeners's reverential feelings for the politician's ancestors\".\n\nAristotle comments on the three modes by stating: \nStoic philosophy began with Zeno of Citium , in which the \"logos\" was the active reason pervading and animating the Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the \"seminal logos\" (\"\"logos spermatikos\"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate matter. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine \"logos\".\n\nThe Stoics took all activity to imply a \"logos\" or spiritual principle. As the operative principle of the world, the \"logos\" was \"anima mundi\" to them, a concept which later influenced Philo of Alexandria, although he derived the contents of the term from Plato. In his Introduction to the 1964 edition of Marcus Aurelius' \"Meditations\", the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote that \"Logos\" ... had long been one of the leading terms of Stoicism, chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe\".\n\nPublic discourse on ancient Greek rhetoric has historically emphasized Aristotle's appeals to \"logos\", \"pathos\", and \"ethos\", while less attention has been directed to Isocrates' teachings about philosophy and \"logos\", and their partnership in generating an ethical, mindful \"polis\". Isocrates does not provide a single definition of \"logos\" in his work, but Isocratean \"logos\" characteristically focuses on speech, reason, and civic discourse. He was concerned with establishing the \"common good\" of Athenian citizens, which he believed could be achieved through the pursuit of philosophy and the application of \"logos\".\n\nIn the Septuagint the term \"logos\" is used for the word of God in the creation of heaven in Psalm 33:6, and in some related contexts.\n\nPhilo (), a Hellenized Jew, used the term Logos to mean an intermediary divine being or demiurge. Philo followed the Platonic distinction between imperfect matter and perfect Form, and therefore intermediary beings were necessary to bridge the enormous gap between God and the material world. The \"Logos\" was the highest of these intermediary beings, and was called by Philo \"the first-born of God\".\nPhilo also wrote that \"the Logos of the living God is the bond of everything, holding all things together and binding all the parts, and prevents them from being dissolved and separated\".\n\nPlato's Theory of Forms was located within the Logos, but the Logos also acted on behalf of God in the physical world. In particular, the Angel of the Lord in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) was identified with the Logos by Philo, who also said that the Logos was God's instrument in the creation of the Universe.\n\nIn Christology, the \"Logos\" () is a name or title of Jesus Christ, seen as the pre-existent second person of the Trinity. The concept derives from , which in the Douay–Rheims, King James, New International, and other versions of the Bible, reads:\nThe Koine Greek reads, \"Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν, καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος.(En arkhêi ên ho lógos, kaì ho lógos ên \"pròs tòn theón, kaì theòs ên ho lógos\".) The definite article is used with 'theos/god', making it 'God', and the second usage is indefinite (without an article), rendering it 'god'. Thus David Bentley Hart translates it as 'In the origin there was the Logos, and the Logos was present with GOD, and the Logos was god'.\n\nHowever, many ancient Greek scholars, including Dr. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton (Professor of New Testament Language and Literature) explains that concepts of definite articles in English and Koine Greek are not similar: \"In the New World Translation the opening verse of the Gospel according to John is mistranslated as follows: “Originally the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.” A footnote which is added to the first word, “Originally,” reads, “Literally, In (At) a beginning.” By using here the indefinite article “a” the translators have overlooked the well-known fact that in Greek grammar nouns may be definite for various reasons, whether or not the Greek definite article is present. A prepositional phrase, for example, where the definite article is not expressed, can be quite definite in Greek, [in Hebrew 10:31, \"εις χειρας θεου ζωντος\" is properly rendered (even by the New World Translation) with the definite article expressed twice, “into the hands of the living God.”] as in fact it is in John 1:1\"\n\nThe word \"logos\" has been used in different senses along with \"rhema\". Both Plato and Aristotle used the term \"logos\" along with \"rhema\" to refer to sentences and propositions.\n\nThe Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek uses the terms \"rhema\" and \"logos\" as equivalents and uses both for the Hebrew word \"dabar\", as the Word of God.\n\nSome modern usage in Christian theology distinguishes \"rhema\" from \"logos\" (which here refers to the written scriptures) while \"rhema\" refers to the revelation received by the reader from the Holy Spirit when the Word (\"logos\") is read, although this distinction has been criticized.\n\nNeoplatonist philosophers such as Plotinus (270 AD) used the term \"Logos\" in ways that drew on Plato and the Stoics, but the term Logos was interpreted in different ways throughout Neoplatonism, and similarities to Philo's concept of Logos appear to be accidental. The Logos was a key element in the meditations of Plotinus regarded as the first Neoplatonist. Plotinus referred back to Heraclitus and as far back as Thales in interpreting Logos as the principle of meditation, existing as the interrelationship between the hypostases—the soul, the intellect (\"nous\"), and the One.\n\nPlotinus used a trinity concept that consisted of \"The One\", the \"Spirit\", and \"Soul\". The comparison with the Christian Trinity is inescapable, but for Plotinus these were not equal and \"The One\" was at the highest level, with the \"Soul\" at the lowest. For Plotinus, the relationship between the three elements of his trinity is conducted by the outpouring of Logos from the higher principle, and \"eros\" (loving) upward from the lower principle. Plotinus relied heavily on the concept of Logos, but no explicit references to Christian thought can be found in his works, although there are significant traces of them in his doctrine. Plotinus specifically avoided using the term Logos to refer to the second person of his trinity. However, Plotinus influenced Gaius Marius Victorinus, who then influenced Augustine of Hippo. Centuries later, Carl Jung acknowledged the influence of Plotinus in his writings.\n\nVictorinus differentiated between the Logos interior to God and the Logos related to the world by creation and salvation.\n\nAugustine of Hippo, often seen as the father of medieval philosophy, was also greatly influenced by Plato and is famous for his re-interpretation of Aristotle and Plato in the light of early Christian thought. A young Augustine experimented with, but failed to achieve ecstasy using the meditations of Plotinus. In his \"Confessions\", Augustine described Logos as the \"Divine Eternal Word\", by which he, in part, was able to motivate the early Christian thought throughout the Hellenized world (of which the Latin speaking West was a part) Augustine's Logos \"had taken body\" in Christ, the man in whom the \"logos\" (i.e. or ) was present as in no other man.\n\nThe concept of the \"logos\" also exists in Islam, where it was definitively articulated primarily in the writings of the classical Sunni mystics and Islamic philosophers, as well as by certain Shi'a thinkers, during the Islamic Golden Age. In Sunni Islam, the concept of the \"logos\" has been given many different names by the denomination's metaphysicians, mystics, and philosophers, including \"ʿaql\" (\"Intellect\"), \"al-insān al-kāmil\" (\"Universal Man\"), \"kalimat Allāh\" (\"Word of God\"), \"haqīqa muḥammadiyya\" (\"The Muhammadan Reality\"), and \"nūr muḥammadī\" (\"The Muhammadan Light\").\n\nOne of the names given to a concept very much like the Christian Logos by the classical Muslim metaphysicians is \"ʿaql\", which is the \"Arabic equivalent to the Greek ('intellect').\" In the writings of the Islamic Neoplatonist philosophers, such as al-Farabi () and Avicenna (d. 1037), the idea of the \"ʿaql\" was presented in a manner that both resembled \"the late Greek doctrine\" and, likewise, \"corresponded in many respects to the Logos Christology.\"\n\nThe concept of Logos in Sufism is used to relate the \"Uncreated\" (God) to the \"Created\" (humanity). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be possible without the Logos. The Logos is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is \"unique\" within each region. Jesus and Muhammad are seen as the personifications of the Logos, and this is what enables them to speak in such absolute terms.\n\nOne of the boldest and most radical attempts to reformulate the Neoplatonic concepts into Sufism arose with the philosopher Ibn Arabi, who traveled widely in Spain and North Africa. His concepts were expressed in two major works \"The Ringstones of Wisdom\" (\"Fusus al-Hikam\") and \"The Meccan Illuminations\" (\"Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya\"). To Ibn Arabi, every prophet corresponds to a reality which he called a Logos (Kalimah), as an aspect of the unique Divine Being. In his view the Divine Being would have for ever remained hidden, had it not been for the prophets, with Logos providing the link between man and divinity.\n\nIbn Arabi seems to have adopted his version of the Logos concept from Neoplatonic and Christian sources, although (writing in Arabic rather than Greek) he used more than twenty different terms when discussing it. For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or \"Universal Man\" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence.\n\nOther Sufi writers also show the influence of the Neoplatonic Logos. In the 15th century Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī introduced the \"Doctrine of Logos and the Perfect Man\". For al-Jīlī, the \"perfect man\" (associated with the Logos or the Holy Prophet) has the power to assume different forms at different times and to appear in different guises.\n\nIn Ottoman Sufism, Şeyh Gâlib (d. 1799) articulates Sühan (Logos-\"Kalima\") in his \"Hüsn ü Aşk\" (\"Beauty and Love\") in parallel to Ibn Arabi's Kalima. In the romance, \"Sühan\" appears as an embodiment of Kalima as a reference to the Word of God, the Perfect Man, and the Reality of Muhammad.\n\nCarl Jung contrasted the critical and rational faculties of logos with the emotional, non-reason oriented and mythical elements of \"eros\". In Jung's approach, logos vs eros can be represented as \"science vs mysticism\", or \"reason vs imagination\" or \"conscious activity vs the unconscious\".\n\nFor Jung, logos represented the masculine principle of rationality, in contrast to its female counterpart, \"eros\":\n\nJung attempted to equate logos and eros, his intuitive conceptions of masculine and feminine consciousness, with the alchemical Sol and Luna. Jung commented that in a man the lunar anima and in a woman the solar animus has the greatest influence on consciousness. Jung often proceeded to analyze situations in terms of \"paired opposites\", e.g. by using the analogy with the eastern yin and yang and was also influenced by the Neoplatonists.\n\nIn his book \"Mysterium Coniunctionis\" Jung made some important final remarks about anima and animus:\n\nIn so far as the spirit is also a kind of \"window on eternity\"... it conveys to the soul a certain influx divinus... and the knowledge of a higher system of the world, wherein consists precisely its supposed animation of the soul.\n\nAnd in this book Jung again emphasized that the animus compensates eros, while the anima compensates logos.\n\n"}
{"id": "1936508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936508", "title": "Mini-Baccarat", "text": "Mini-Baccarat\n\nMini-Baccarat is a smaller, lower-stakes version of Punto banco Baccarat. Mini-Baccarat is different in that it is generally lower limits than baccarat. It is also different in that the player does not get to pick up the cards, and the fact that the table is smaller in size. Mini-Baccarat is popular in many casinos, especially among Asian gamblers.\n\nIn original Baccarat the banker deals two cards to the “punters” (players) and to himself, face-down from the shoe. If anyone has a count of eight or nine, they should turn their cards face-up and win immediately. A count of six or seven means a player must stand. In case the count is less than five a player has to pull out the third card. The banker must draw to a point under three, stand with a point above six. He can do either with a point of three to a player’s third-card nine or with a point of five to a player’s third-card four. In other case, the banker should draw or stand as dictated by the most-favorable odds. Like Baccarat, Mini-Baccarat is a comparing card game played between two hands, the \"player\" and the \"banker\". Each baccarat coup has three possible outcomes: \"player\" (player has the higher score), \"banker\" (banker has the high score), and \"tie\". It is strictly a game of chance, with no skill or strategy involved; each player's moves are forced by the cards the player is dealt.\n\nIn Mini-Baccarat, cards have a point value: cards two through nine are worth face value (in points); tens, jacks, queens and kings have no point value (i.e. are worth zero); aces are worth 1 point; jokers are not used. Hands are valued according to the \"rightmost digit\" of the sum of their constituent cards. If the total of the cards is a two-digit number, ten is subtracted from the total value of the hand. So, a hand of a 7 and a 4 would be one. For example, a hand consisting of 2 and 3 is worth 5, but a hand consisting of 6 and 7 is worth 3 (i.e., the 3 being the rightmost digit in the combined points total of 13). The highest possible hand value in baccarat is therefore nine.\n\nThe Player and Banker are each dealt two cards. If either Player or Banker or both achieve a total of 8 or 9 with the first two cards (known as a \"natural\"), the coup is finished and the result is announced: Player win, a Banker win, or tie. Natural 9 beats natural 8. If neither the Player nor Banker is dealt a total of 8 or 9 in the first two cards, the tableau is consulted, first for Player's rule, then Banker's. \n\n\nIf Player drew a third card, the Banker acts according to the following more complex rules:\n\nThe casinos list these rules in a more easily remembered format as follows:\n\n\nIf a player bets on tie and the hands tie, the player win 8:1 or 9:1 depending on the house rules.\n"}
{"id": "702661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=702661", "title": "Natya Shastra", "text": "Natya Shastra\n\nThe Nāṭya Śāstra (Sanskrit: नाट्य शास्त्र, \"Nāṭyaśāstra\") is a Sanskrit text on the performing arts. The text is attributed to sage Bharata Muni, and its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE.\n\nThe text consists of 36 chapters with a cumulative total of 6000 poetic verses describing performance arts. The subjects covered by the treatise include dramatic composition, structure of a play and the construction of a stage to host it, genres of acting, body movements, make up and costumes, role and goals of an art director, the musical scales, musical instruments and the integration of music with art performance.\n\nThe \"Nāṭya Śāstra\" is notable as an ancient encyclopedic treatise on the arts, one which has influenced dance, music and literary traditions in India. It is also notable for its aesthetic \"Rasa\" theory, which asserts that entertainment is a desired effect of performance arts but not the primary goal, and that the primary goal is to transport the individual in the audience into another parallel reality, full of wonder, where he experiences the essence of his own consciousness, and reflects on spiritual and moral questions. The text has inspired secondary literature such as Sanskrit bhasya (reviews and commentaries) such as by the 10th century Abhinavagupta.\n\nThe title of the text is composed of two words, \"Nāṭya\" and \"Śāstra\". The root of the Sanskrit word \"Natya\" is \"Nat\" (नाट) which means \"act, represent\". The word \"Shastra\" (शास्त्र) means \"precept, rules, manual, compendium, book or treatise\", and is generally used as a suffix in the Indian literature context, for knowledge in a defined area of practice.\n\nThe composition date of \"Natyashastra\" is unknown, estimates vary between 500 BCE to 500 CE. The text may have started in the 1st millennium BCE, expanded over time, and most scholars suggest, based on mention of this text in other Indian literature, that the first complete version of the text was likely finished between 200 BCE to 200 CE. The \"Natya Shastra\" is traditionally alleged to be linked to a 36,000 verse Vedic composition called \"Adibharata\", however there is no corroborating evidence that such a text ever existed.\n\nThe text has survived into the modern age in several manuscript versions, wherein the title of the chapters vary and in some cases the content of the few chapters differ. Some recensions show significant interpolations and corruption of the text, along with internal contradictions and sudden changes in style. Scholars such as PV Kane state that some text was likely changed as well as added to the original between the 3rd to 8th century CE, thus creating some variant editions, and the mixture of poetic verses and prose in a few extant manuscripts of \"Natyasastra\" may be because of this. According to Pramod Kale, who received a doctorate on the text from the University of Wisconsin, the surviving version of \"Natya Shastra\" likely existed by the 8th-century.\n\nThe author of the \"Natya Shastra\" is unknown, and the Hindu tradition attributes it to the \"Rishi\" (sage) Bharata. It may be the work of several authors, but scholars disagree. Bharat Gupt states that the text stylistically shows characteristics of a single compiler in the existing version, a view shared by Kapila Vatsyayan. The \"Agni Purana\", a generic encyclopedia, includes chapters on dramatic arts and poetry, which follow the \"Natyashastra\" format, but enumerates more styles and types of performance arts, which states Winternitz, may reflect an expansion in studies of the arts by the time \"Agni Purana\" was composed.\n\nThe \"Natyashastra\" is the oldest surviving ancient Indian work on performance arts. The roots of the text extend at least as far back as the \"Natasutras\", dated to around the mid 1st millennium BCE. \n\nThe \"Natasutras\" are mentioned in the text of Panini, the sage who wrote the classic on Sanskrit grammar, and who is dated to about 500 BCE. This performance arts related Sutra text is mentioned in other late Vedic texts, as are two scholars names Shilalin (IAST: Śilālin) and Krishashva (Kṛśaśva), credited to be pioneers in the studies of ancient drama, singing, dance and Sanskrit compositions for these arts. The \"Natyashastra\" refers to drama performers as Śhailālinas, likely because they were so known at the time the text was written, a name derived from the legacy of the vedic sage Śilālin credited with \"Natasutras\". Richmond et al. estimate the \"Natasutras\" to have been composed around 600 BCE.\n\nAccording to Lewis Rowell, a professor of Music specializing on classical Indian music, the earliest Indian artistic thought included three arts, syllabic recital (\"vadya\"), melos (\"gita\") and dance (\"nrtta\"), as well as two musical genre, \"Gandharva\" (formal, composed, ceremonial music) and \"Gana\" (informal, improvised, entertainment music). The \"Gandharva\" subgenre also implied celestial, divine associations, while the \"Gana\" was free form art and included singing. The Sanskrit musical tradition spread widely in the Indian subcontinent during the late 1st millennium BCE, and the ancient Tamil classics make it “abundantly clear that a cultivated musical tradition existed in South India as early as the last few pre-Christian centuries”.\n\nThe art schools of Shilalin and Krishashva, mentioned in both the Brahmanas and the Kalpasutras and Srautasutras, may have been associated with the performance of vedic rituals, which involved storytelling with embedded ethical values. The Vedanga texts such as verse 1.4.29 of \"Panini Sutras\" mention these as well. The roots of the \"Natyashastra\" thus likely trace to the more ancient vedic traditions of integrating ritual recitation, dialogue and song in a dramatic representation of spiritual themes. The Sanskrit verses in chapter 13.2 of Shatapatha Brahmana (~800–700 BCE), for example, are written in the form of a riddle play between two actors.\n\nThe most studied version of the text, consisting of about 6000 poetic verses, is structured into 36 chapters. The tradition believes that the text originally had 12,000 verses. Somewhat different versions of the manuscripts exist, and these contain 37 or 38 chapters. Predominant number of its verses are in precise Anustubh meter (4x8, or exactly 32 syllables in every \"shloka\"), some verses are in Arya meter (a morae-based Sanskrit meter), and the text has some text that is in prose particularly in chapters 6, 7 and 28.\n\nThe structure of the text harmoniously compiles aspects of the theatrical arts into separate chapters. The text opens with the mythical genesis and history of drama, mentions the role of different Hindu deities in various aspects of the arts, and the recommended Puja (consecration ceremony) of a stage for performance arts. The text, states Natalia Lidova, then describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures.\n\nChapters 6 and 7 present the \"Rasa\" theory on aesthetics in performance arts, while chapters 8 to 13 are dedicated to the art of acting. Stage instruments such as methods for holding accessories, weapons, relative movement of actors and actresses, scene formulation, stage zones, conventions and customs are included in chapters 10 to 13 of the \"Natyashastra\".\n\nThe chapters 14 to 20 are dedicated to plot and structure of underlying text behind the performance art. These sections include the theory of Sanskrit prosody, musical meters and the language of expression. Chapter 17 presents the attributes of poetry and figures of speech, while chapter 18 presents the art of speech and delivery in the performance arts. The text lists ten kinds of play, presents its theory of plot, costumes, and make-up. The text dedicates several chapters exclusively to women in performance arts, with chapter 24 on female theater. The training of actors is presented in chapters 26 and 35 of the text.\n\nThe theory of music, techniques for singing, and music instruments are discussed over chapters 28 to 34. The text in its final chapters describes the various types of dramatic characters, their roles and need for team work, what constitutes an ideal troupe, closing out the text with its comments of the importance of performance arts on culture.\n\nThe contents of the \"Natyashastra\", states Susan Schwartz, are \"in part theatrical manual, part philosophy of aesthetics, part mythological history, part theology\". It is the oldest surviving encyclopedic treatise on dramaturgy from India, with sections on the theory and practice of various performance arts. The text extends its reach into asking and understanding the goals of performance arts, the nature of the playwright, the artists and the spectators, their intimate relationship during the performance. \"Natya\" topics as envisioned in this text includes what in western performing arts would include drama, dance, theatre, poetry and music. The text integrates its aesthetics, axiology and description of arts with mythologies associated with Hindu Devas and Devis. Performance arts, states \"Natyashastra\", are a form of Vedic ritual ceremony (yajna).\n\nThe general approach of the text is treat entertainment as an effect, but not the primary goal of arts. The primary goal is to lift and transport the spectators, unto the expression of ultimate reality and transcendent values. The text allows, states Schwartz, the artists \"enormous innovation\" as they connect the playwright and the spectators, through their performance, to \"Rasa\" (the essence, juice).\n\nThe \"rasa theory\" of \"Natyashastra\", states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, presumes that bliss is intrinsic and innate in man, it exists in oneself, that manifests non-materially through spiritual and personally subjective means. Performance arts aim to empower man to experience this \"rasa\", or re-experience it. Actors aim to journey the spectator to this aesthetic experience within him. Rasa is prepared, states \"Natya Shastra\", through a creative synthesis and expression of \"vibhava\" (determinants), \"anubhava\" (consequents) and \"vyabhicharibhava\" (transitory states). In the process of emotionally engaging the individual in the audience, the text outlines the use of eight sentiments – erotic, comic, pathetic, terrible, furious, odious, heroic and marvellous.\n\nThe text discusses a variety of performance arts as well as the design of the stage.\n\nThe \"Natyashastra\" defines drama in verse 6.10 as that which aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor's art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a super sensual inner state of being. The \"Natya\" connects through \"abhinaya\", that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein asserts \"Natyashastra\", the actors use two practices of \"dharmi\" (performance), in four styles and four regional variations, accompanied by song and music in a playhouse carefully designed to achieve \"siddhi\" (success in production). Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art to engage every aspect of life, in order to glorify and gift a state of joyful consciousness.\n\nThe text discusses the universal and inner principles of drama, that it asserts successfully affects and journeys the audience to a supersensual state of discovery and understanding. The stories and plots were provided by the Itihasas (epics), the Puranas and the Kathas genre of Hindu literature.\n\nThe text states that the playwright should know the \"bhavas\" (inner state of being) of all characters in the story, and it is these bhavas that the audience of that drama connects with. The hero is shown to be similar to everyone in some ways, trying to achieve the four goals of human life in Hindu philosophy, then the \"vastu\" (plot) emerges through the \"representation of three worlds – the divine, the human, the demonic\". Drama has dharma, it has artha, it has kama, it has humor, fighting and killing. The best drama shows the good and the bad, actions and feelings, of each character, whether god or man.\n\nAccording to \"Natyashastra\", state Sally Banes and Andre Lepeck, drama is that art which accepts human beings are in different inner states when they arrive as audience, then through the art performed, it provides enjoyment to those wanting pleasure, solace to those in grief, calmness to those who are worried, energy to those who are brave, courage to those who are cowards, eroticism to those who want company, enjoyment to those who are rich, knowledge to those who are uneducated, wisdom to those who are educated. Drama represents the truths about life and worlds, through emotions and circumstances, to deliver entertainment, but more importantly ethos, questions, peace and happiness.\n\nThe function of drama and the art of theatre, as envisioned in \"Natyashastra\" states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, is to restore the human potential, man's journey of \"delight at a higher level of consciousness\", and a life that is enlightened.\n\nThe text goes into specifics to explain the means available within dramatic arts to achieve its goals. Just like the taste of food, states \"Natyashastra\", is determined by combination of vegetables, spices and other articles such as sugar and salt, the audience tastes dominant states of a drama through expression of words, gestures and temperaments. These dominant states are love, mirth, sorrow, anger, energy, terror, disgust and astonishment. Further, states the text, there are 33 psychological states which are transitory such as discouragement, weakness, apprehension, intoxication, tiredness, anxiety, agitation, despair, impatience. There are eight temperamental states that a drama can deploy to carry its message. The text describes four means of communication between the actors and the audience – words, gestures, dresses and \"aharya\" (make ups, cosmetics), all of which should be harmonious with the temperament envisioned in the drama. The text discusses the dominant, transitory and temperamental states, for dramatic arts, and the means that an artist can use to express these states, in chapters 6 through 7.\n\nThe \"Natyasastra\" describes the stage for performance arts as the sacred space for artists, and discusses the specifics of stage design, positioning the actors, the relative locations, movement on stage, entrance and exit, change in background, transition, objects displayed on the stage, and such architectural features of a theatre; the text asserts that these aspects help the audience get absorbed in the drama as well as understand the message and the meaning being communicated. After the 10th-century, Hindu temples were designed to include stages for performance arts (for example, \"kuttampalams\"), or prayer halls (for example, \"namghar\") that seconded as dramatic arts stage, based on the square principle described in the \"Natyasastra\", such as those in the peninsular and eastern states of India.\n\nThe \"Natyasastra\" discusses Vedic songs, and also dedicates over 130 verses to non-Vedic songs. Chapter 17 of the text is entirely dedicated to poetry and the structure of a song, which it states is also the template for composing plays. Its chapter 31 asserts that there are seven types of songs, and these are \"Mandraka\", \"Aparantaka\", \"Rovindaka\", \"Prakari\", \"Ullopyaka\", \"Ovedaka\" and \"Uttara\". It also elaborates on 33 melodic alankaras in songs. These are melodic tools of art for any song, and they are essential. Without these melodic intonations, states the text, a song becomes like \"a night without the moon, a river without water, a creeper with a flower and a woman without an ornament\". A song also has four basic architectural \"varna\" to empower its meaning, and these tone patterns are ascending line, steady line, descending line and the unsteady line.\n\nThe ideal poem produces bliss in the reader, or listener. It transports the audience into an imaginative world, transforms his inner state, and delivers him to a higher level of consciousness, suggests \"Natyashastra\". Great songs do not instruct or lecture, they delight and liberate from within to a state of godlike ecstasy. According to Susan Schwartz, these sentiments and ideas of \"Natyashastra\" likely influenced the devotional songs and musical trends of the Bhakti movement that emerged in Hinduism during the second half of the 1st millennium CE.\n\nIndian dance (\"nritta\", नृत्त) traditions, states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, have roots in the aesthetics of \"Natyashastra\". The text defines the basic dance unit to be a \"karana\", which is a specific combination of the hands and feet integrated with specific body posture and gait (\"sthana\" and \"chari\" respectively). Chapter 4 describes 108 \"karanas\" as the building blocks to the art of dance. The text states the various movements of major and minor limbs with facial states as means of articulating ideas and expressing emotions.\n\nThe \"Natyashastra\" is, states Emmie Te Nijenhuis, the oldest surviving text that systematically treats \"the theory and instruments of Indian music\". Music has been an integral part of performance arts in the Hindu tradition since its Vedic times, and the theories of music found in the \"Natyasastra\" are also found in many Puranas, such as the Markandeya Purana.\nThe ancient Indian tradition, before the \"Natyashastra\" was finalized, classified musical instruments into four groups based on their acoustic principle (how they work, rather than the material they are made of). The \"Natyashastra\" accepts these four categories as given, and dedicates four separate chapters to them, one each on stringed instruments (chordophones), hollow instruments (aerophones), solid instruments (idiophones), and covered instruments (membranophones).\n\nChapters 15 and 16 of the text discuss Sanskrit prosody in a manner similar to those found in more ancient Vedanga texts such as the \"Pingala Sutras\". Chapters 28 through 34 are dedicated to music, both vocal and instrument based. Chapter 28, discusses the harmonic scale, calling the unit of tonal measurement or audible unit as \"Śruti\", with verse 28.21 introducing the musical scale as follows,\n\nThe music theory in the \"Natyashastra\", states Maurice Winternitz, centers around three themes – sound, rhythm and prosody applied to musical texts. The text asserts that the octave has 22 \"srutis\" or microintervals of musical tones or 1200 cents. This is very close to the ancient Greek system, states Emmie Te Nijenhuis, with the difference that each \"sruti\" computes to 54.5 cents, while the Greek enharmonic quartertone system computes to 55 cents. The text discusses \"gramas\" (scales) and \"murchanas\" (modes), mentioning three scales of seven modes (21 total), some of which are the same as the Greek modes. However, the Gandhara-grama is just mentioned in \"Natyashastra\", while its discussion largely focuses on two scales, fourteen modes and eight four \"tanas\" (notes). The text also discusses which scales are best for different forms of performance arts.\n\nThe \"Natyashastra\" describes from chapter 28 onwards, four types of regular musical instruments, grouping them as stringed giving the example of veena, covered giving the example of drums, solid giving the example of cymbals, and hollow stating flutes as example. Chapter 33 asserts team performance, calling it \"kutapa\" (orchestra) which it states to have one male and one female singer with nine to eleven musical instruments accompanied by players.\n\nThe \"Natyashastra\" enshrines the male and female actors in any performance art to be the most important. The brightness of performance, or its lack, impacts everything; a great play that is poorly performed confuses and loses the audience, while a play that is inferior in significance or meaning becomes beautiful to the audience when brilliantly performed, states \"Natyashastra\". A performance art of any form needs auditors and director, states the text, whose role is to work together with the actors from the perspective of the audience and the significance or meaning the playwright of the art work is attempting to convey.\nThe text dedicates significant number of verses on actor training, as did the Indian dramaturgy literature that arose in its wake. The ideal actor training, states \"Natyashastra\", encourages self-development within the actor and raises the actor's level of consciousness, which in turn empowers him or her to express ideas from that higher state of consciousness. Acting is more than physical techniques or rote recitation, it is communication through emotions and expression of embedded meaning and levels of consciousness in the underlying text.\n\nThe actor, states the text, should understand the three Guṇas, that is \"Sattva\", \"Rajas\" and \"Tamas\" qualities, because human lives are an interplay of these. The actor must feel a specific state within, to express it without. Thus, states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, the guidelines in \"Natyasastra\" employ the ideas in Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, with concepts mirroring \"asanas\", \"pranayama\" and \"dhyana\", both for actor training and the expression of higher levels of consciousness.\n\nSpecific training on gestures and movements for actors, their performance and significance, are discussed in chapters 8 through 12 of the \"Natyashastra\". Chapter 24 is dedicated to females in performance arts, however other chapters on actor training include numerous verses that mention women along with men.\n\nThe \"Natyashastra\" and other ancient Hindu texts such as the Yajnavalkya Smriti assert that arts and music are spiritual, with the power to guide one to moksha, through empowering the concentration of mind for the liberation of the Self (soul, Atman). These arts are offered as alternate paths (\"marga\" or yoga), in strength similar to the knowledge of the Srutis (Vedas and Upanishads). Various medieval scholars, such as the 12th-century Mitaksara and Apararka, cite \"Natyashastra\" and Bharata in linking arts to spirituality, while the text itself asserts that beautiful songs are sacred and performance arts are holy.\n\nThe goal of performance arts, states \"Natyashastra\" is ultimately to let the spectator experience his own consciousness, then evaluate and feel the spiritual values innate in him, and rise to a higher level of consciousness. The playwright, the actors and the director (conductor) all aim to transport the spectator to an aesthetic experience within him to eternal universals, to emancipate him from the mundane to creative freedom within.\n\n\"Abhinavabhāratī\" is the most studied commentary on \"Natyasastra\", written by Abhinavagupta (950–1020 CE), who referred to \"Natyasastra\" also as the \"Natyaveda\". Abhinavagupta's analysis of \"Natyasastra\" is notable for its extensive discussion of aesthetic and ontological questions, such as \"whether human beings comprehend performance arts as \"tattva\" (reality and truth in another plane), or is it an error, or is it a form of superimposed reality (\"aropa\")?\n\nAbhinavagupta asserts that \"Natyasastra\" and performance arts appeal to man because of \"the experience of wonder\", wherein the observer is pulled in, immersed, engaged, absorbed, and satisfied. The performance arts in \"Natyasastra\", states Abhinavagupta, temporarily suspends man from his ordinary world, transfers him into another parallel reality full of wonder, where he experiences and reflects on spiritual and moral concepts, and in there is the power of arts to transform the inner state of man, where the beauty of the art lifts him into the goals of Dharma (correct living, virtues, duties, right versus wrong, responsibilities, righteous). Abhinavagupta is also known for his Advaita Vedanta treatises and a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, where he touches upon the aesthetics in \"Natyasastra\".\n\nThe detailed \"Natyasastra\" review and commentary of Abhinavagupta mentions older Sanskrit commentaries on the text, suggesting the text was widely studied and had been influential. His discussion of pre-10th century scholarly views and list of references suggest that there once existed secondary literature on the \"Natyasastra\" by at least Kirtidhara, Bhaskara, Lollata, Sankuka, Nayaka, Harsa and Tauta. However, all text manuscripts of these scholars have been lost to history or are yet to be discovered.\n\nThe first chapter of the text declares that the text's origins came after the four Vedas had been established, and yet there was lust, covetousness, wrath and jealously among human beings. The text was written as a fifth Veda, so that the essence of the Vedas can be heard and viewed, in \"Natya\" form to encourage every member of the society to dharma, artha and kama. The text originated to enable arts that influence the society and encourage each individual to consider good counsel, to explain sciences and demonstrate arts and crafts widely. The text is a guide and progeny of what is in the Vedas, asserts the \"Natysashastra\". The text re-asserts a similar message in the closing chapter, stating for example, in verses 36.20–21 that performance arts such as drama, songs, music, and dance with music are equal in importance as the exposition of the Vedic hymns, and that participating in vocal or instrumental music once is superior to bathing in river Ganges for a thousand days.\n\nNāṭyaśāstra, states Natalia Lidova, has been far more than \"a mere compendium on drama\". It provided the foundation of theatrical and literary works that followed, which shaped the post-Vedic culture. It has been an important source book of Hindu performance arts and its cultural beliefs regarding the role of arts in the social (dharmic) as well as the personal inner life of man in Hinduism.\n\nThe \"Natysashastra\" text has been influential in other arts. The 108 dance forms described in the \"Natyasastra\", for example, have inspired Shiva sculptures of the 1st-millennium BCE, particularly the Tandava style which fuses many of these into a composite image found at the Nataraja temple of Chidambaram. The movements of dance and expression in the \"Natyashastra\" are found carved on the pillars, walls and gateways of 1st-millennium Hindu temples.\n\nThe specifications provided in the \"Natyashastra\" can be found in the depiction of arts in sculpture, in icons and friezes across India.\n\nThe \"Rasa\" theory of \"Natyashastra\" has attracted scholarly interest in communication studies for its insights into developing texts and performances outside the Indian culture.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "416095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=416095", "title": "Psychic detective", "text": "Psychic detective\n\nA psychic detective is a person who investigates crimes by using purported paranormal psychic abilities. Examples have included postcognition (the paranormal perception of the past), psychometry (information psychically gained from objects), telepathy, dowsing, clairvoyance, and remote viewing. In murder cases, psychic detectives may purport to be in communication with the spirits of the murder victims.\n\nAlthough there are documented cases where individuals claiming psychic abilities have assisted police in solving crimes, there is considerable skepticism in regard to the general use of psychics under these circumstances. Many police departments around the world have released official statements saying that they do not regard psychics as credible or useful on cases.\n\nMany prominent police cases, often involving missing persons, have received the attention of alleged psychics. In November 2004, purported psychic Sylvia Browne told the mother of kidnapping victim Amanda Berry, who had disappeared 19 months earlier: \"She's not alive, honey.\" Browne also claimed to have had a vision of Berry's jacket in the garbage with \"DNA on it\". Berry's mother died two years later believing that her daughter had been killed; Berry was found alive in May 2013 having been a kidnapping victim of Ariel Castro along with Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus. After Berry was found alive, Browne received criticism for the false declaration that Berry was dead. Browne also became involved in the case of Shawn Hornbeck, which received the attention of psychics after the eleven-year-old went missing on 6 October 2002. Browne appeared on \"The Montel Williams Show\" and provided the parents of Shawn Hornbeck a detailed description of the abductor and where Hornbeck could be found. Browne responded \"No\" when asked if he was still alive. When Hornbeck was found alive more than four years later, few of the details given by Browne were correct. Shawn Hornbeck's father, Craig Akers, has stated that Browne's declaration was \"one of the hardest things that we've ever had to hear\", and that her misinformation diverted investigators wasting precious police time.\n\nWhen Washington, D.C. intern Chandra Levy went missing on 1 May 2001, psychics from around the world provided tips suggesting that her body would be found in places such as the basement of a Smithsonian storage building, in the Potomac River, and buried in the Nevada desert among many other possible locations. Each tip led nowhere. A little more than a year after her disappearance, Levy's body was accidentally discovered by a man walking his dog in a remote section of Rock Creek Park.\n\nFollowing the disappearance of Elizabeth Smart on 5 June 2002, the police received as many as 9,000 tips from psychics (and others crediting visions and dreams as their source). Responding to these tips took \"many police hours\", according to Salt Lake City Police Chief Lieutenant Chris Burbank. Yet, Elizabeth Smart's father, Ed Smart, concluded that: \"the family didn't get any valuable information from psychics.\" Smart was located by observant witnesses who recognized her abductor from a police photograph. No psychic was ever credited with finding Elizabeth Smart.\n\nIn the case of the Long Island serial killer, the psychic said the body would be found in a shallow grave, near water and a sign with a G in it would be nearby. Despite the vagueness of this claim (the body was not in a shallow grave, water is everywhere in Long Island, and no sign with a G was nearby) the \"New York Post\" stated that the \"Psychic Nailed it!\". Describing the case, skeptic and author Benjamin Radford wrote: \"more surprising than the psychic's failure is the fact that this information was described as an amazing success on over 70,000 websites without anyone realizing that she was completely wrong.\"\n\nA body was located in the US by Psychic Annette Martin. Dennis Prado, a retired US paratrooper, had gone missing from his apartment and police had been unable to locate his whereabouts. With no further leads, the chief investigating officer, Fernando Realyvasquez, a sergeant with the Pacifica (California) Police, contacted psychic detective Annette Martin. Prado had lived near a large forest, some 2000 square miles. Martin was given a map, she circled a small spot on the map, about the size of two city blocks. She said that Prado had struggled for breath, had died, and his body would be there within the indicated area. She described the path he took, and where the body would be found. Although the area had been searched before and Prado had not been found, a search and rescue officer initiated a new search with the help of a search dog, as Martin suggested \"A search dog is going to find him.\" They found the body covered with dirt at the location, as Martin had indicated. While the body had deteriorated, there was no evidence that he had been attacked and it is thought that he had likely died of natural causes, as she also indicated.\n\nIn August 2010, Aboriginal elder Cheryl Carroll-Lagerwey claimed to have seen the location of a missing child, Kiesha Abrahams, in her dream. The missing child's disappearance was being investigated by police. She took them to a location where a dead body was found, however it was of an adult woman and not the body of the child.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, in 1996, a Belgian-born Sydney psychic, Phillipe Durant was approached by the fiancé of missing Paula Brown to help locate her. Durante told police the location of the body of Brown. She was found less than two kilometres of the spot he had indicated in Port Botany, New South Wales, by a lorry driver who came across the body. \"Even though the body was discovered purely by chance, the speculation by a clairvoyant appears to have been uncannily accurate\", a police spokeswoman conceded. Durant had used a plumb bob and a grid map, combined with some hair from the victim.\n\nIn 2001, the body of Thomas Braun was located by Perth-based Aboriginal clairvoyant Leanna Adams in Western Australia. Police had initially been unable to find the body. The family of Braun had been told to contact Adams, an Aboriginal psychic who lived in Perth. The Braun family had requested police to do a search based on Adams's directions but they had not assisted. Adams went to Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, and took the family members directly to Braun's remains, a spot high on a ridge west of the town, some 20 kilometres out. The remains were not immediately identifiable. Police later confirmed the remains to be his using DNA testing.\n\nNoreen Renier claimed to have solved the murder of Kimberly McAndrew who was murdered August 12, 1989. Six years after McAndrew went missing the Halifax Regional Police hired Renier to help. Renier gave the police three interviews which were recorded and obtained for review by Tampa Bay Skeptics founder Gary P. Posner. Using psychometry Renier claimed to channel the murder victim. After a long analysis of the tapes Posner states that Renier took the detectives \"on a wild goose chase\". All Renier's statements were misleading, vague or incoherent, never leading to anything solid that could be verified. Renier assured the police that the body would be found before Christmas saying it would be \"a nice Christmas present for everybody\". As of 2018 the body of Kimberly McAndrew has not been discovered and nothing that Renier said on the three recordings has assisted the police in any way. Recordings of Noreen Renier can be found here.\n\nMany police departments around the world have released official statements saying that they do not regard psychics as credible or useful on cases.\n\nAustralian police, officially, in general have said that they do not accept assistance from psychics. This was in response to an Australian TV show \"Sensing Murder\" in which psychics attempt to crack unsolved murders.\nWestern Australian Police have a policy that they do not contact psychics for assistance with investigations, however they will accept information contributed by psychics. \nAn unnamed Australian federal police officer was suspended following his seeking the aid of a clairvoyant in regard to death threats made against Prime Minister John Howard. A federal police spokesman said they do \"not condone the use of psychics in security matters.\"\nThere are still cases of psychics professing to have trained with the Australian police and failing to provide credible evidence to support qualifications or evidence of being a psychic profiler or intuitive profiler with the Australian police.\n\nWhile official policy for police forces in Australia does not advocate the use of psychics for investigations, one former Detective Senior Constable, Jeffrey Little, has said police do use them \"even though they officially say they don't\". Additionally, police in NSW have used psychic Debbie Malone on a number of cases. While no evidence she has supplied has solved murders or missing investigations on their own, her evidence had been used to corroborate theories, and in one case, included in a coroner's brief on a case. Little, in reference to one case she assisted on, felt her description of what happened was \"exceptional\", other officers also had been impressed by her assistance, while yet other NSW officers felt she had not helped solve any cases. Sergeant Gae Crea and Detective Sergeant Damian Loone, state that she did not give them anything the police and the public didn't already know. Crea recounts \"I've dealt with a lot of psychics, but no one has ever said, 'I can see where the body is buried and I'll take you there'\".\n\nNew Zealand police have said \"spiritual communications were not considered a creditable foundation for investigation.\"\n\nIn 2006, 28 British police forces responded to a query from the Association for Rational Inquiry to say that they did not and have never used psychics, one force saying \"We are unaware of any inquiries significantly progressed solely by information provided by a psychic medium.\" In 2009, when the Metropolitan Police had denied the use of psychics and were then presented with emails suggesting the use of a psychic they made a press statement authorized by the senior investigating officer that was much more ambiguous: \"We do not identify people we may or may not speak with in connection with inquiries. We are not prepared to discuss this further.\"\n\nA 1993 survey of police departments in the 50 largest cities in the United States revealed that a third of them had accepted predictions from psychic detectives in the past, although only seven departments treated such information any differently from information from an ordinary source. No police department reported any instances of a psychic investigator providing information that was more helpful than other information received during the course of a case, since any information has to be proved, only information matching other evidence could be used. A follow-up study looking at small and medium-sized cities in the United States, found that psychics were called upon by the police departments of those cities even less frequently than large cities. A former senior investigator for the FBI has stated that psychics may be used \"as a last resort <nowiki>[and]</nowiki> as an investigative tool with caution\" for providing clues not directly admissible in the court of law such as a criminal's character, or the location of dead bodies.\n\nA number of tests have been conducted on psychics detectives, using control groups, to try to establish any psychic ability relating to crime solving. One of the earliest was carried out by Dutch Police officer, Fillipus Brink in 1960. He conducted a year-long study of psychics, but found no evidence of any crime-solving abilities. Another study was conducted in 1982 where evidence from four crimes was given to three groups: psychic detectives, students and police detectives. The clues related to four crimes, two crimes that had been solved, and two that had not been. The study found no difference between the three groups in ability to indicate what crimes had been committed by looking at the evidence. Some flaws in the scientific method were apparent in these two tests. A further test was conducted in 1997, this test focusing on improving on the scientific methods used in the previous tests. This study used two groups, one consisting of three students from the University of Hertfordshire, the other group consisting of three psychics (two psychic detectives and a non-detective psychic who had a media profile and had been endorsed by police due to his abilities). The two groups were shown three objects associated with three serious crimes. They then advocated theories, but once again, no difference was found in terms of the accuracy between the two groups.\n\nTo assess the claims of psychic crime-solving, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (now Committee for Skeptical Inquiry) established a task force of investigators. The group recorded many failures by psychics to provide useful information to criminal investigators, and felt that psychics may use \"retrofitting\" (or after-the-fact matching), offering vague clues, and then trying to retroactively fit them to details that are only discovered later. In addition to cases of retrofitting, the apparent use of cold reading (a psychic's fishing for information while appearing to gain it paranormally), exaggeration, and examples where the psychic has used non-psychic sources of information, were also reviewed.\n\nIn 2008, while being interviewed for the \"Skeptiko\" podcast, managing editor of Skeptical Inquirer, Ben Radford challenged the host, Alex Tsakiris, to give him the best case for evidence of a psychic solving a crime. As Tsakiris had \"repeatedly accused skeptical investigators of purposely choosing the weakest cases\", Radford agreed to investigate in depth a case from any period in history, around the world, \"that presented the gold standard for evidence\". Tsakiris chose psychic Nancy Weber who, in 2006, appeared on an episode of the Biography Channel \"Psychic Investigators\". Weber claimed to have helped the New Jersey police solve the 1952 serial murders of Amie Hoffman and Dierdre O'Brien. The police arrested James Koedatich in 1983 who was later found guilty of serial murder. \"Psychic Investigators\" interviewed Weber as well as the two police detectives she worked with, Hughes and Moore, who verified Weber had given them information \"she could not have known\". Radford spent the next nine months reviewing the case, and he and Tsakiris re-interviewed the detectives as well as the psychic on the \"Skeptiko\" podcast. Radford discovered that the detectives had not kept their notes from the case, and that their story had changed since the TV show aired. In fact, he found that their stories now contradicted the psychic's story. A further discovery by Radford using a New Jersey phone book from 1982 found that if the psychic had indeed given the detectives all the evidence she claimed she had, the police could have discovered the killer with a 15-minute search through the phone book. Radford believes that the police and the psychic \"simply fell prey to confirmation bias\".\n\nABC's Nightline \"\" program for 17 August 2011 featured psychic detectives and their involvement with the case of Ali Lowitzer. Typical of missing person cases, families are approached by people claiming they will help bring the missing home. \"They told me, I see trees, water, dirt...but it is all very vague\" according to Susan Lowitzer a mother whose daughter has been missing since 26 April 2010. Retired FBI agent and ABC consultant Brad Garrett states, \"In 30 years...I have never seen a psychic solve a mystery\". JREF investigator and mentalist Banachek feels that psychic detectives take advantage of families, \"...because of fame and money, [they] step in and try to act like an authority\". Banachek believes that not all psychic detectives are frauds, some are self-deluded and believe they are helping, but they \"send police on wild-goose chases wasting precious time and resources\". Psychic Georgia O'Conner states that Ali is dead, she was tortured and her body dismembered. When asked by ABC's JuJu Chang how can she tell parents this kind of information when she might be wrong, O'Conner replies \"I can't let my ego get in the way of what I see\". Despite the attention from psychic detectives Ali Lowitzer remains missing from her Spring, Texas home.\n\nNo psychic detective has ever been praised or given official recognition by the FBI or US national news for solving a crime, preventing a crime, or finding a kidnap victim or corpse.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Criminology, Australia's official crime research agency, advises parents of missing children not to resort to using psychics who approach them. Former FBI analyst and profiler Clint Van Zandt has criticized the use of psychic detectives and has stated that \"What happens many times is that professed psychics allow themselves the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. After the case is solved, they make their previously vague predictions somehow fit the crime and the criminal.\" A detailed 2010 study of Sylvia Browne predictions about 115 missing persons and murder cases has found that despite her repeated claims to be more than 85% correct, \"Browne has not even been mostly correct in a single case.\"\n\nPsychologists, researchers and other authors have posited a number of possible explanations for the belief that some can provide valuable crime information from psychic abilities. The possible explanations include confirmation bias (or our natural tendency to favor information to confirm our beliefs), wishful thinking (which is the act of making decisions based upon what is appealing rather than reasoned), and \"retrofitting\" (or retroactively refining the specifics of a prediction after the facts are revealed). The act of reinterpreting vague and nebulous statements made by psychic detectives is also referred to as the \"multiple out\". Taking advantage of these cognitive limitations is the practice of cold reading which creates the illusion of knowing specific information. Additionally, police detectives and other authors suggest that psychic detectives appear successful due to making common-sense or high-probability predictions such as finding bodies at dump sites or \"near water.\"\n\nWhile police departments claim they do not seek out or use psychics to solve crimes, they must follow up on all credible tips. If police do not refute this theory then \"many in the public continue to believe that psychics are secretly employed by law enforcement\" If the police state they do not use psychics then psychics claim that the police do not want to \"share the credit\" and are just covering up.\n\nFinally, the use of psychics may simply reduce anxiety and fill the emotional needs of individuals who must be experiencing great stress.\n\nThere is a long history of psychic detectives in horror and crime fiction, and in other genres as well. One of the earliest forms of the genre was the character Flaxman Low, created in 1897 by mother and son Kate and Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard. The Prichards wrote their stories at the behest of the press baron Cyril Pearson for his monthly \"Pearson's Magazine\", though they were disconcerted to find the tales promoted by Pearson as \"real\". The collected work was published as \"The Experiences of Flaxman Low\" in 1899.\n\nOther literary examples include Jules de Grandin (created by Seabury Quinn), Doctor Occult (created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster) and Agent Jasi McLellan created by Cheryl Kaye Tardif.\n\nThe popular TV show, \"Psych\" features a charlatan paranormal detective helping the Santa Barbara police with crimes that range from robberies to kidnappings to murders. However, the man actually uses an acute sense of observation he acquired as a child; a eidetic memory; excellent vision; and deduction and reasoning to solve cases, making a running gag of his claim to be a psychic.\n\nIn Douglas Adams's \"Dirk Gently\" novels, the titular character—a \"holistic\" detective—is implied to have psychic powers on occasion. One incident involved Gently attempting to scam his university classmates into paying for a set of answers to an exam, supposedly obtained using psychic powers that Gently did not think he had. To his surprise, the answers he provided, which he thought he had produced randomly, turned out to be entirely correct. He was expelled as a result.\n\nPeter F. Hamilton wrote a series of books about the ex-military psychic Greg Mandel. In the series, Greg was a retired special forces soldier created as part of an elite spec-ops unit, the Mindstar Brigade, in the 'English Army', having fought a vicious war in Turkey and helped a rebellion overthrow the People's Socialist Party at home. Having won the rebellion he then retired to Rutland, suddenly being called out of retirement by the rich heirhess Julia Evans to use his psychic talents to find the root of industrial espionage against her company, Event Horizon [an organisation that was also integral to the overthrow of the communist government]. The series not only focuses on Greg's abilities, but also the abilities of other psychics created as part of the Mindstar Programme, the effects of social and economic change throughout the 21st century, global warming and rapid scientific advances. Greg regularly uses his abilities both for interrogation and as an offensive weapon.\n\nThe episode \"Bart the Murderer\" of \"The Simpsons\" depicts a psychic joining the hunt to find Principal Skinner.\n\nThe episode \"Cartman's Incredible Gift\" of \"South Park\" depicts a skeptical view of psychic detectives.\n\nThe manga and anime series \"YuYu Hakusho\" depicts a teenage boy named Yusuke Urameshi working as a Spirit Detective: a human who hunts down demons using psychic abilities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27690813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27690813", "title": "Radio in Argentina", "text": "Radio in Argentina\n\nRadio in Argentina is an important facet of the nation's media and culture. Radio, which was first broadcast in Argentina in 1920, has been widely enjoyed in Argentina since the 1930s. Radio broadcast stations totaled around 150 active AM stations, 1,150 FM stations, and 6 registered shortwave transmitters. An estimated 24 million receivers were in use in 2000 (2.4 per household).\n\nRadio broadcasting enjoys a long and varied history in Argentina, tracing its origins to a 1910 stay in the southside Buenos Aires suburb of Bernal by Guglielmo Marconi, inventor of the wireless telegraph. There, he achieved a rudimentary radio transmission with a kite-mounted antenna connected to earphones. Argentine publisher José C. Paz later sponsored Marconi's radio transmission from Italy to Buenos Aires, the first transatlantic broadcast into South America.\nThree local medical students, led by Enrique Susini, began their own radio experiments in 1917 and, installing transmission equipment in Buenos Aires' Coliseo Theatre, they broadcast, on August 27, 1920, \"Parsifal\", the first opera on radio and only the second radio broadcast in the World. These installations became LOR Radio Argentina, the World's first formal radio station. The number of receivers in the city at the time: around 20. This station was joined in 1922 by LOX, whose ad for the Los Andes Restaurant is probably the World's first on radio. Several more stations opened in Buenos Aires during Argentina's prosperous 1920s and growing numbers of artists signed contracts for live performances on the growing variety of radio dramas.\n\nLeading stations at the time began broadcasting from the numerous, ornate theatre stages in Buenos Aires, including LR5 Radio Splendid (so named for the venue where its shows were produced, the Grand Splendid Theatre). Among the notable events broadcast live at the time was President Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear's inaugural, in 1922, and the 1923 \"bout of the century\" in Polo Grounds, New York City, between Jack Dempsey and Luis Ángel Firpo for the World Heavyweight title.\n\nThe medium's boom and the lucrative local ad market allowed Susini to sell his station in 1930 to U.S. telecom giant ITT for US$200 million, a record at the time. The visionary entrepreneur invested a part of the funds into Lumiton Studios, among the first to produce sound movies in the world.\n\nArgentine radio embraced tango in the early 1930s, airing the work of orchestras such as Francisco Canaro's and Julio de Caro's; LR1-Mundo (referred to as LR1 for its being the first on the dial) became the standard for tango broadcasts. The decade saw the rise of Jaime Yankelevich, a former radio valve distributor, as the dominant force in the medium, thorough Radio El Mundo (inaugurated in 1935), and Radio Belgrano, which became the first in Argentina to broadcast through a chain of repeater stations, and the first to expand into late-night broadcasting. Buenos Aires was by then home to 25 stations (as many as in New York, a city, at the time, almost three times larger). The state entered the radio market in 1937, with the inaugural of LRA Radio Nacional Radio Mitre became the first in Argentina to broadcast around the clock, in 1960.\n\nLuis Sandrini's \"Felipe\" and other comedy shows became ratings leaders during the 1940s, and as most Argentines were still either immigrants or first and second generation Argentines, many revolved around the use of thickly accented ethnic humor. Some of the most popular were Niní Marshall's characters, particularly \"Catita\" and \"Cándida (1939 film)\". The trend was not without its detractors, however, and in 1943, the newly installed dictatorship of General Pedro Ramírez banned humor which \"deformed the language,\" leading to exile for Marshall and numerous other radio stars.\nProgramming focused on Argentine folk music and Peronist propaganda during the populist administration of President Juan Perón, who met his influential wife, Evita, when the latter was a radio matinée star; among Perón's most compelling voices in support on the radio was Tango composer Enrique Santos Discépolo, who also hosted political commentary shows. The public sector became increasingly involved in Argentine radio during Perón's 1946-55 presidency, and afterwards. All broadcast chains were nationalized, and state radio extended overseas in 1958 with the inaugural of the Argentine Foreign Broadcasting Service. The station became only the third in the Western Hemisphere (after the Voice of America and Radio Canada International) to broadcast internationally and in several languages.\n\nTelevision in Argentina, which had been developed by Jaime Yankelevich in 1951 under state licence, eroded radio's listener base during the 1950s and '60s. A number of radio hosts, however, such as musician Jorge Raúl Batallé, talent show host Roberto Galán, and news and commentary hosts, such as Antonio Carrizo, Cacho Fontana, and Héctor Larrea (whose \"Rapidísmo\", from 1967, became influential to the Argentine morning show format) rivaled their television counterparts.\nCensorship also intensified, however, and a number of commentators had shows cancelled, notably Hugo Guerrero Marthineitz, who hosted the intellectual interview program, \"El show del minuto\". The \"Comité Federal de Radiodifusión\" (COMFER) was established in 1972 to both regulate the growing number of unlicensed stations, as well as to increase state influence over the medium. The return of Juan Perón from exile led to a second round of nationalizations in 1974, including all major television stations. The Radio Broadcasting Law of 1980, which led to the privatization of 44 stations, touched off an era of state disinvolvement in Argentine radio, however, and helped lead to corporate consolidation over the airwaves. Many of these hitherto public radio stations (known by their acronym, LRA) had helped extend the medium into Argentina's then-remote far north and Patagonia. Argentine radio, was long dominated by AM broadcasting (only 22 FM stations were in service), and AM remained popular on the airwaves, even as FM stations grew to outnumber these in subsequent decades.\n\nThe return of democracy in 1983 led to an unprecedented selection of news programs, and many became known for muck-raking exposés; some of the highest-rated included Magdalena Ruiz Guiñazú, Santo Biasatti, and Nelson Castro. A number of new stations dedicated to Rock music and other forms of pop culture also opened, notably \"Rock & Pop\" (1985), led by Daniel Grinbank; the station became well known in the late 1980s for its irreverent \"Radio Bangkok\" program, hosted by Lalo Mir. Easy listening host Nora Perlé (\"Canciones son amores\"), \"Jazzología\" host Carlos Inzillo, Variety show host Chiche Gelblung (\"Edición Chiche\"), and critic and raconteur Alejandro Dolina (\"La venganza sera terrible\"), also became prominent in radio broadcasting at this time.\nFootball remained a perennial favorite on the Argentine radio, and some of the best-known announcers have included Fioravanti, José María Muñoz, Enrique Macaya Márquez, Horacio Pagani, Marcelo Araujo, and Víctor Hugo Morales, among many others.\n\nArInfo (Buenos Aires) became the first Argentine station to broadcast online in 2001 and by 2009, 61 stations did so, nationwide. The ownership structure of both radio and television broadcasting became increasingly concentrated after the 1980 Media Law, however, and many of the most popular radio stations are owned by conglomerates, including Radio Continental (Telefé), Radio Mitre (Grupo Clarín), Radio Rivadavia (Grupo Uno), and Radio 10 (Daniel Hadad). The contentious Audiovisual Communication Services Law, signed by President Cristina Kirchner in 2009 and upheld by the Argentine Supreme Court in 2013, would restrict the number of media licences per proprietor and limit the influence of the principal media conglomerates by allocating a greater share of these to the state and NGOs.\n\n"}

Key figures are Jesse Richards and Peter Rinaldi.\n\nOn August 27, 2008, Jesse Richards published a 15-point Remodernist Film Manifesto, calling for a \"new spirituality in cinema\", use of intuition in filmmaking, as well as describing the remodernist film as being a \"stripped down, minimal, lyrical, punk kind of filmmaking\". Point 4 is:\n\nThe Japanese ideas of wabi-sabi (the beauty of imperfection) and mono no aware (the awareness of the transience of things and the bittersweet feelings that accompany their passing), have the ability to show the truth of existence, and should always be considered when making the remodernist film.\n\nThere are also several polemic statements made in the manifesto that criticize Stanley Kubrick, filmmakers that shoot on digital video, as well as Dogme 95. In December, 2008, Turkish film magazine \"Bakiniz\" translated the manifesto into Turkish and soon after Polish magazine \"Red\" translated it into Polish.\n\nRemodernist film calls for a return to emotional and spiritual meaning in cinema, as well as an emphasis on new ideas of narrative structure and subjectivity. Elements of No Wave Cinema, French New Wave, punk film, expressionist, spiritual and transcendental filmmaking, as well as Antonin Artaud's ideas on the Theatre of Cruelty helped lead to this new film movement. They champion the works of Andrei Tarkovsky, Yasujirō Ozu, Robert Bresson, Jean Rollin, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jean Vigo, Amos Poe, Jean Epstein and Nicholas Ray among others, as well as Bela Tarr's film \"Satantango\" and Jean-Luc Godard's \"Hail Mary\".\n\nThe idea of Stuckism in relation to filmmaking and photography started 2001 when Jesse Richards and Nicholas Watson began releasing work as The New Haven Stuckists Film Group. On March 8, 2008 their film \"Shooting at the Moon\" made its London premiere at Horse Hospital during its FLIXATION Underground Cinema Club event. Remodernist Film and Photography was founded by Richards and Smith in 2004.\n\nFilms later seen as Remodernist included \"Youngblood\" (1995) by Harris Smith, \"Shooting at the Moon\" (1998–2003) by Jesse Richards and Nicholas Watson, and \"Medway Bus Ride\" (1999) by Wolf Howard.\n\nAmos Poe is part of the movement, which he said was \"just a bunch of kids.\" He said in 2008:\n\nIn late August, 2009, an International Alliance of Remodernist Filmmakers was started by Jesse Richards in order to promote discussion and collaboration amongst those following the manifesto. The filmmakers include Jesse Richards, Harris Smith, Christopher Michael Beer, Dmitri Trakovsky, Kate Shults, Peter Rinaldi and Khurrem Gold of America, Roy Rezaali of Holland, Rouzbeh Rashidi of Iran and Dean Kavanagh of Ireland.\n\nIn October, 2009, with the intention \"to further develop and explain Remodernist film concepts\", a series of articles by Jesse Richards, Peter Rinaldi and Roy Rezaali were published in the magazine MungBeing.\n\nRichards said, \"Remodernism rejected Postmodernism for its 'failure to answer or address any important issues of being a human being'\", and that Remodernism is \"about seeking truth, establishing meaningful connections\" and \"addressing the shadow\".\n\nIn his essay \"Concepts and Craft in Remodernist Film\", Richards said that Remodernist film craft \"embraces the amateur\", involves the idea of filmmakers \"teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean. I think that is the exploration of craft\".\n\nThe article explains the differences between modernist, post-modernist and remodernist cinema, describing Robert Bresson and Andrei Tarkovsky as \"early Remodernist filmmakers\", and notes films that make emphasis of \"small moments\", including Bela Tarr's film \"Satantango\", \"...every moment of the film \"Satantango\" is a good example of this kind of exploration of \"moments\"- the film starts with a ten-minute shot following cows coming out of a barn and wandering around a run-down agriculture collective. These kinds of moments are all but ignored in most examples of modern cinema, and that's a terrible, terrible thing\".\n\nRichards says of Remodernist filmmaking:\n\nI believe that the most effective way to really make subjective and authentic work involves an \"addressing of the shadow\" (as Billy Childish and Charles Thomson have described it). Now what does this mean exactly? It might mean that you are really obsessed with pubic hair, or maybe you are really embarrassed by a physical or mental disability that you try to hide, or like Billy Childish, you were abused as a child. \n\nIn another article, entitled \"A Quick Primer and History\", Richards relaxes the criticism in the manifesto against digital video, noting that it can \"have a place in Remodernist cinema\" but that it should be given a new language, and that it currently \"mimic(s) film\". The article also broadens the aim of the movement, explaining the common bond among Remodernist filmmakers being a search for truth, knowledge, authenticity and spirituality in their work, but having different approaches on achieving that goal.\n\nPeter Rinaldi, analyzes the manifesto and shares his \"personal thoughts\" on it in his essay, \"The Shore as seen from The Deep Sea\". Particularly, he defends the criticism of digital and later of Stanley Kubrick, saying first, \"for the most part, the \"easiness\" of video has led to degradation in the images created\", and:\nI think, for the most part, the generation that I grew up in had Kubrick as their Giant. His work has a mystical \"perfectionism\" that is awe-inspiring at times. This perfectionism is anathema to the Remodernist mentality and for many healthy reasons, this giant (or whatever giant towers over your work) must fall in our minds. We must become the giant. \n\nThe rest of the article draws direct connections between ideas in the manifesto and some Christian and Buddhist teachings.\n\nIn June 2010, after publishing a letter from Richards about the Remodernist Film Manifesto on his site, film critic Roger Ebert tweeted, \"Much discussed on serious film blogs: The Remodernist Film Manifesto. Lars von Trier, get out of town\".\n\nIn February 2010, the Australian film magazine \"Filmink\" announced the forthcoming production of a compilation feature film being made by members of the Remodernist film movement, which the magazine says “recalls art movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries which saw artists attempting to strive toward artistic freedom and authenticity\". The film, which will consist of ten-minute pieces by various members of the film movement “from around the globe”, is scheduled to premiere in December, 2010 in New York. Participating filmmakers include: Peter Rinaldi, Kate Shults, Rouzbeh Rashidi, Dean Kavanagh, Roy Rezaali, Heidi Beaver and Christopher Michael Beer. Richards’ \"Remodernist Film Manifesto\" “forms the basis” of the joint project.\n\nThe film's premiere was announced for November 13, 2011 at the Quad Cinemas in New York City.\n\nIn the November 2011 print edition of \"Filmink\", film scholar, critic and programmer Jack Sargeant wrote about the movement and \"In Passing\", referring to the movement as \"the new personal cinema\" and describing the evolution of \"lyrical cinema\" from the work of Andrei Tarkovsky, Wim Wenders, Jim Jarmusch, Bela Tarr and through to the Remodernist filmmakers.\n\nSargeant goes onto describe \"In Passing\":\n\nThe film is neither a fully experimental work, nor a movie fixated on classic narrative; rather, In Passing explores the passing of time and the relation of time to cinematic space. Often focusing on intimate yet small details – the table top exploration of a crustacean, the patter of rain on a window, cats at play, the ocean shot from a moving car, a couple looking into a camera knowing that the film they are making will fail – and finding something lyrically poignant and even personal within these transient moments. There are scenes in which people seem to vanish, no longer seen onscreen, yet the space they once occupied still resonates with their echoes, moving through the poetic sublime.In common with Wim Wenders, Jim Jarmusch and Gus Van Sant, and films like \"Meek's Cutoff\", there is a sense of homesickness to the films that make up \"In Passing\". This sense of homesickness is not necessarily rooted in a sense of being away from home, but in the sense that even at home, the protagonists are still searching for their place within the day-to-day world.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40445271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40445271", "title": "Ridiculusmus", "text": "Ridiculusmus\n\nRidiculusmus is an award-winning British theatre company founded in 1992 by Angus Barr, Jon Haynes and David Woods. Their work has been described as \"seriously funny,\" \"Dadaist\" and \"physical theatre.\" Theatre critic Ian Shuttleworth said that Ridiculusmus is \"not so much rough theatre as completely dishevelled.\" Since 1996, the company has been led by Haynes and Woods as co-directors, and although the majority of their stage works in recent years have been two-handers, they additionally work with a large pool of collaborators.\n\nTheir first few productions were adaptations of novels, but, apart from a two-man version of \"The Importance of Being Earnest,\" produced in 2005, since 1997 Haynes and Woods have devised and written all Ridiculusmus' plays. Some of these have been published by Oberon Books and commissioned by the Barbican, London.\n\nThe founding members met as students at London's Poor School and while there they began busking on the London underground and doing comedy club open spots. They called themselves Mel, Pat & Harm, and performed comic songs from the 1920s and 1930s to the accompaniment of Barr's ukulele. They also opened a Dadaist comedy club called The Tomato Club above a couscous restaurant in Kentish Town. The highlight of the evening was the \"tomato spot,\" in which comics were invited to perform deliberately bad material to an audience armed with over-ripe tomatoes. The listing in \"Time Out\" said \"Don't come,\" to which the magazine added \"probably advice worth taking.\"\n\nOn graduating from The Poor School, Ridiculusmus filled a cancelled slot at London's Canal Cafe Theatre with a hastily produced adaptation of Jerome K. Jerome's \"Three Men in a Boat.\" It played to mixed reviews and encouraged the troupe to produce more adaptations; their next production was a promenade version of Flann O'Brien's cult classic novel \"The Third Policeman.\" Opening at Aras na Gael, the show, with free pints of The Wrastler stout given to any audience member bringing a bicycle part, became an instant small scale hit. Adding fellow Poor School graduates Kevin Henshall and Lucy Cuthbertson, the company grew to five members. Finding it difficult to survive in London, Ridiculusmus began to tour, and jumped at an offer to be in residence at The Playhouse in Derry, Northern Ireland. A trio once again—Woods and Haynes adapted another O'Brien novel, \"At Swim-Two-Birds\", which toured widely.\n\nIn 1996 Ridiculusmus broke away from the adaptation of novels and began writing and producing their own work. The development season in the Sister Mary room at the playhouse in Derry resulted in three self-authored pieces, \"School\", \"The Exhibitionists\" and \"Christmas.\"\n\n\"The Exhibitionists\" went on to tour nationally and internationally over the next six years.\n\nIn 1999 Woods and Haynes coined the acrostic mnemonic ARSEFLOP to articulate their working principles: Attitude, Reality, Sensitivity, Edge, Focus, Listen, Open Your Heart and Play.\n\nRidiculusmus has created seven more main stage works in the last 15 years: \"Say Nothing\"; \"Ideas Men\"; \"Tough Time, Nice Time\"; \"Total Football\"; \"The World Mouse Plague\"; \"The Eradication of Schizophrenia in Western Lapland\" and \"Give Me Your Love\". \n\n\nThe group, who had been project grant recipients, were up until the end of March 2015 a National portfolio organisation of the Arts Council of England. They have received project funding from many prestigious sources such as the \"National Lottery\" through \"Arts Council England\"; the \"Wellcome Trust\"; \"Royal Victoria Hall Foundatio\"n; the Australian Government through the \"Australia Council for the Arts\"; \"Victorian College of the Arts\", \"Melbourne University\" and the \"City of Melbourne\" through Arts House and its Culture Lab programme.\n\n"}
{"id": "13462164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13462164", "title": "Royal entry", "text": "Royal entry\n\nThe Royal Entry, also known by various names, including Triumphal Entry, Joyous Entry, consisted of the ceremonies and festivities accompanying a formal entry by a ruler or his representative into a city in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period in Europe. The entry centred on a procession carrying the entering prince into the city, where he was greeted and paid appropriate homage by the civic authorities. A feast and other celebrations would follow.\n\nThe Entry began as a gesture of loyalty and fealty by a city to the ruler, with its origins in the \"adventus\" celebrated for Roman emperors, which were formal entries far more frequent than triumphs. The first visit by a new ruler was normally the occasion, or the first visit with a new spouse. For the capital they often merged with the Coronation festivities, and for provincial cities they replaced it, sometimes as part of a Royal Progress, or tour of major cities in a realm. (See also Itinerant court, about this.)\n\nFrom the late Middle Ages entries became the occasion for increasingly lavish displays of pageantry and propaganda. The devising of the iconography, aside from highly conventional patterns into which it quickly settled, was managed with scrupulous care on the part of the welcoming city by municipal leaders in collaboration with the chapter of the cathedral, the university, or hired specialists. Often the greatest artists, writers and composers of the period were involved in the creation of temporary decorations, of which little record now survives, at least from the early period.\n\nThe contemporary account from Galbert of Bruges of the unadorned \"Joyous Advent\" of a newly installed Count of Flanders into \"his\" city of Bruges, in April 1127, shows that in the initial stage, undisguised by fawning and triumphalist imagery that came to disguise it, an Entry was similar to a parley, a formal truce between the rival powers of territorial magnate and walled city, in which reiteration of the city's \"liberties\" in the medieval sense, that is its rights and prerogatives, were set out in clear terms and legitimated by the presence of saintly relics:\n\"On April 5... at twilight, the king with the newly elected Count William, marquis of Flanders, came into our town at Bruges. The canons of Saint Donatian had come forth to meet them, bearing relics of the saints and welcoming the king and new count joyfully in a solemn procession worthy of a king. On April 6... the king and count assembled with their knights and ours, with the citizens and many Flemings in the usual field where reliquaries and relics of the saints had been collected. And when silence had been called for, the charter of the liberty of the church and of the privileges of Saint Donatian was read aloud before all... There was also read the little charter of agreement between the count and our citizens... Binding themselves to accept this condition, the king and count took an oath on the relics of saints in the hearing of the clergy and people\".\n\nThe procession of a new Pope to Rome was known as a \"possesso\". A ruler with a new spouse would also receive an Entry. The entry of Queen Isabeau of Bavaria into Paris in 1389 was described by the chronicler Froissart. The Entries of Charles IX of France and his Habsburg queen, Elizabeth of Austria, into Paris, March 1571, had been scheduled for Charles alone in 1561, for the \"entrate\" were typically celebrated towards the beginning of a reign, but the French Wars of Religion had made such festivities inappropriate, until the peace that followed the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye signed in August 1570.\n\nUntil the mid-14th century, the occasions were relatively simple. The city authorities waited for the prince and his party outside the city walls, and after handing over a ceremonial key with a \"loyal address\" or speech, and perhaps stopping to admire \"tableaux vivants\" such as those that were performed at the entry into Paris of Queen Isabeau of Bavaria, described in detail by the chronicler Froissart, conducted him through the streets which were transformed with colour, with houses on the route hanging tapestries and embroideries or carpets or bolts of cloth from their windows, and with most of the population lining the route. At Valladolid in 1509\n\nHeraldic displays were ubiquitous: at Valladolid in 1509, the bulls in the fields outside the city were caparisoned with cloths painted with the royal arms and hung with bells. Along the route the procession would repeatedly halt to admire the set-pieces embellished with mottoes and pictured and living allegories, accompanied by declamations and the blare of trumpets and volleys of artillery. The procession would include members of the three Estates, with the nobility and gentry of the surrounding area, and the clergy and guilds of the city processing behind the prince. From the mid-14th century the guild members often wore special uniform clothes, each guild choosing a bright colour; in Tournai in 1464 three hundred men wore large embroidered silk fleur de lys (the royal badge) on their chests and backs, at their own expense. The prince reciprocated by confirming, and sometimes extending, the customary privileges of the city or a local area of which it was the capital. Usually the prince also visited the cathedral to be received by the bishop and confirm the privileges of the cathedral chapter also. There a \"Te Deum\" would be customary, and music written for the occasion would be performed.\n\nDuring the 14th century, as courtly culture, with the court of Burgundy in the lead, began to stage elaborate dramas re-enacting battles or legends as entertainment during feasts, the cities began to include in entry ceremonies small staged pageant \"tableaux\", usually organised by the guilds (and any communities of foreign merchants resident), and drawing on their growing experience of medieval theatre and pageantry. Initially these were on religious themes, but \"gradually these tableaux developed, through the fifteenth and into the sixteenth century, into a repertory of archways and street-theatres which presented variants of a remarkably consistent visual and iconographical vocabulary.\" Fortune with her wheel, Fame and Time, the seven Virtues, both Christian and Classical, and the Nine Worthies and other Classical, Biblical and local heroes, among whose number the honoree was now to be counted. As the tradition developed, the themes became more specific, firstly stressing the legitimacy of the prince, and his claim by descent, then setting before him the princely virtues and their rewards, which especially included the benefits to him of encouraging prosperous cities and provinces.\n\nThe procession might pause for allegorical figures to address it, or pass beside a genealogical tree or under a temporary classical-style triumphal arch with either painted figures or posed actors perching on it, standing in for statuary in the case of arches. Still more elaborate entertainments began to be staged during or after the civic feast, and by the mid-17th century these could be as spectacular as the staged naval battles, masques, operas and ballets that courts staged for themselves. The court now often had a major role in both designing and financing entries, which increasingly devoted themselves to the glorification of the absolute monarch as hero, and left the old emphasis on his obligations behind; \"any lingering possibilities of its use as a vehicle for dialogue with the middle classes vanished\". At the third \"triumph\" at Valladolid in 1509, a lion holding the city's coat-of-arms shattered at the King's arrival, revealing the royal arms: the significance could not have been lost, even on those unable to hear the accompanying declamation.\n\nDuring the 16th century, at dates differing widely by location, the tableau vivant was phased out and mostly replaced by painted or sculpted images, although many elements of street-theatre persisted, and small masques or other displays became incorporated into the programmes. The entry in 1514 of Mary Tudor to Paris, as Louis XII's new Queen, was the first French entry to have a single organizer; ten years before Anne of Brittany's entry had been \"largely medieval\", with five stops for mystery plays in the streets.\n\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, the entry of the ten-year-old Henry VI of England, to be crowned king of France in Paris, 2 December 1431, was marked with great pomp and heraldic propaganda. Outside the city he was welcomed by the mayor in a blue velvet \"houppelande\", his retinue in violet with scarlet caps, and representatives of the Parlement de Paris in red trimmed with fur. At the porte Saint-Denis the royal party were greeted with a grand achievement of the French arms that Henry claimed, gold fleurs de lis on an azure ground. The king was offered large red hearts, from which doves were released, and a rain of flowers pelted the procession. At the symbolic gateway, a canopy of estate embroidered with more gold lilies was erected over the young king, who was carried in a litter supported on six lances carried by men dressed in blue. Through the city there were welcoming pageants and allegorical performances: before the Church of the Innocents, a forest was erected, through which a captured stag was released and \"hunted\".\n\nEducated folk of the Middle Ages had close at hand an example of an allegorical series of entries at a wedding, in the frame story that opens Martianus Capella's encyclopedic introduction to all one needed to know of the arts, \"On the Wedding of Philology and Mercury and of the Seven Liberal Arts.\" With the revival of Classical learning, Italian entries became influenced by literary descriptions of the Roman triumph. Livy's account was supplemented by detailed descriptions in Suetonius and Cassius Dio of Nero's Greek Triumph, and in Josephus of the Triumph of Titus.\n\nMore recherché sources were brought to bear; Aulus Gellius' \"Noctes Atticae\" furnished a detail that became part of the conventional symbolism: coronation with seven crowns. Boccaccio's long poem \"Amorosa visione\" (1342–43), following the schema of a triumph, offered a parade of famous personages, both historical and legendary, that may have provided a model for Petrarch, who elaborated upon Livy in an account of the triumph of Scipio Africanus and in his poem \"I Trionfi\". Castruccio Castracani entered Lucca in 1326 riding in a chariot, with prisoners driven before him. Alfonso V of Aragon entered Naples in 1443 seated on a triumphal car under a baldachin, as is shown by a surviving bas-relief on the earliest, and still perhaps the most beautiful, permanent post-classical Triumphal arch, which he built the same year. In Italian, specific meanings developed for \"trionfo\" as both the whole procession, and a particular car or cart decorated with a display or tableau; although these usages did not spread exactly to other languages, they lie behind terms such as \"triumphal entry\" and \"triumphal procession\".\n\nThe emphasis began to shift from the displays as static tableaux that were passed by a procession in festive but normal contemporary dress, to the displays' being incorporated in the procession itself, a feature also of the religious medieval pageant; the tableaux were mounted on \"carri\", the precursors of the float, and were now often accompanied by a costumed throng. The carnival parades of Florence that were refined to a high pitch in the late quattrocento set a high standard; they were not without a propaganda element at times, as in the lavish parades of Carnival 1513, following the not-universally welcomed return of the Medici the previous year; the theme of one pageant, more direct than subtle: \"The Return of the Golden Age\". With the French invasions of Italy from 1494, this form of entry spread north. Cardinal Bibbiena reported in a letter of 1520 that the Duke of Suffolk had sent emissaries to Italy to buy horses and bring back to Henry VIII of England men who knew how to make festal decorations in the latest Italian manner.\nCharles V was indulged in a series of Imperial \"entrate\" in Italian cities during the Habsburg consolidation after the Sack of Rome, notably in Genoa, where Charles and his heir Philip made no less than five triumphal entries. Impressive occasions like Charles V's Royal Entry into Messina in 1535 have left few concrete survivals, but representations were still being painted on Sicilian wedding-carts in the 19th century.\n\nAfter Mantegna's great mural of the Triumphs of Caesar rapidly became known throughout Europe in numerous versions in print form, this became the standard source, from which details were frequently borrowed, not least by Habsburg rulers, who especially claimed the Imperial legacy of Rome. Although Mantegna's elephants were difficult to copy, chained captives, real or acting the part, were not, and elaborate triumphal carts, often pulled by \"unicorns\" might replace the earlier canopy held over the prince on horseback. The woodcuts and text of the \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\" of 1499 were another well-known source, and Petrarch's \"I Trionfi\" was printed in many illustrated editions; both were works of mythological allegory, with no obvious political content. Entries became displays of conspicuous learning, often with lengthy Latin addresses, and the entertainments became infused with matter from the abstruse worlds of Renaissance emblems and hermeticism, to which they were very well suited. In the world of Renaissance Neo-Platonism, the assertion and acting-out of the glory and power of the prince might actually bring it about.\n\nA precocious example of the Entrata with a consistent and unified allegorical theme was the Entry of Medici pope Leo X into Florence, November 1515. All the city's artistic resources were drawn upon to create this exemplary Entry, to a planned programme perhaps devised by the historian Jacopo Nardi, as Vasari suggested; the Seven Virtues represented by seven triumphal arches at stations along the route, the seventh applied as a temporary façade to the Duomo, Santa Maria del Fiore, which still lacked a permanent one.\n\nApart from the permanent theme of the reciprocal bonds uniting ruler and ruled, in times of political tension the political messages in Entries became more pointed and emphatic. A disputed succession would produce a greater stress on the theme of legitimacy. After the Reformation, tension became a permanent condition, and most Entries contained a sectarian element. After about 1540 French entries and Habsburg ones in the Low Countries were especially freighted with implication, as the rulers' attempts to suppress Protestantism brought Protestant and Catholic populations alike to the edge of ruin. But initially this increased the scale of displays, whose message was now carefully controlled by the court.\nThis transformation happened much earlier in Italy than in the North, and a succession of entries for Spanish Viceroys to the blockaded city of Antwerp, once the richest in Northern Europe and now in steep decline, were \"used by the city fathers to combine increasingly eulogistic celebrations of their Habsburg rulers with tableaux to remind them of the commercial ruin over which they presided.\" The \"Pompa Introitus\" of the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand into Antwerp in 1635, devised by Gaspar Gevartius and carried out under the direction of Rubens, was made unmistakably pointed, and included a representation of the god of commerce, Mercury, flying away, as a lamenting figure representing Antwerp points at him and looks imploringly out at the Viceroy, whilst beside her lie a sleeping sailor and a river god, representing the wrecked trade of the city from the blockading of the river Scheldt. Eventually the Viceroy managed to obtain the lifting of the ban on trade with the Indies which the entry had represented as Antwerp's only hope of escaping ruin; but by then the Spanish had agreed to the permanent blockade of the river.\nIn 1638, the occasion of the French queen mother Marie de Medici's triumphal entry into Amsterdam lent \"de facto\" international recognition of the newly formed Dutch Republic, though she actually traveled to the Netherlands as an exile. Spectacular displays and water pageants took place in the city's harbor; a procession was led by two mounted trumpeters; a large temporary structure erected on an artificial island in the Amstel River was built especially for the festival. This building was designed to display a series of dramatic tableaux in tribute to her once she set foot on the floating island and entered its pavilion. The distinguished poet and classicist Caspar Barlaeus wrote the official descriptive booklet, \"Medicea Hospes, sive descriptio publicae gratulationis, qua ... Mariam de Medicis, excepit senatus populusque Amstelodamensis\". Published by Willem Blaeu, it includes two large folding engraved views of the ceremonies.\n\nAlthough the essence of an entry was that it was supposed to be a peaceful, festive occasion, very different from the taking of a town by assault, several entries actually followed military action by the town against their ruler, and were very tense affairs. In 1507 the population of Genoa revolted against the French who had conquered them in 1499, and restored their Republic. Louis XII of France defeated the Genoan army outside the city, which then agreed a capitulation, including an entry which was followed by the execution of the Doge and other leaders of the revolt. The gestural content was rather different from a peaceful entry; Louis entered in full armour, holding a naked sword, which he struck against the portal as he entered the city, saying \"Proud Genoa! I have won you with my sword in my hand\".\n\nCharles V entered Rome in splendour less than three years after his army had sacked the city. The famously troublesome citizens of Ghent revolted against Philip the Good in 1453 and Charles V in 1539, after which Charles arrived with a large army and was greeted with an entry. A few weeks later he dictated the programme of a deliberately humiliating anti-festival, with the burghers coming barefoot with nooses round their necks to beg forgiveness from him which, after imposing a huge fine, he consented to do. The entries of Charles and his son Philip in 1549 were followed the next year by a ferocious anti-Protestant edict that began the repression that led to the Revolt of the Netherlands, in the course of which Antwerp was to suffer a terrible sack in 1576 and a long siege in 1584–85, which finally ended all prosperity in the city.\n\nDuring the 17th century the scale of entries began to decline. There was a clear trend, led from Medici Florence, to transfer festivities involving the monarch into the private world of the court. The \"intermezzi\" developed in Florence, the \"ballet de cour\" that spread from Paris, the English masque, and even elaborate equestrian ballets all increased as entries declined. In 1628, when Marie de' Medici commissioned from Rubens a \"Triumphal Entry of Henri IV into Paris\", it was for a suite of grand decorations for her own palace, the Luxembourg; Rubens did not recreate historic details of the 1594 Royal Entry, but overleapt them to render the allegory itself (\"illustration\").\n\nThe cultural atmosphere of Protestantism was less favourable to the Royal Entry. In the new Dutch Republic entries ceased altogether. In England, part of the Accession Day festivities in 1588, following the defeat of the Spanish Armada were especially joyous and solemn. Delaying the event a week to 24 November, Elizabeth rode in triumph, \"imitating the ancient Romans\" from her palace of Whitehall in the city of Westminster to enter the city of London at Temple Bar. She rode in a chariot\n\"made with four pillars behind, to have a canopie, on the top whereof was made a crowne imperiall, and two lower pillars before. whereon stood a lyon and a dragon, supporters of the armes of England, drawn by two white horses\"\n\nThe Earl of Essex followed the triumphal car, leading the caparisoned and riderless horse of estate, followed by the ladies of honour. The windows of houses along the procession route up the Strand were hung with blue cloth. At Temple Bar, the official gate to the City, there was music and the Lord Mayor handed over the mace and received it again. In a \"closet\" constructed for the occasion, the Queen heard a festive service celebrated by fifty clergymen at St. Paul's Cathedral and returned in a torchlit procession in the evening.\n\nNevertheless, the entry of James I into London in 1604 was the last until the Restoration of his grandson in 1660, after the English Civil War. The court of Charles I intensified the scale of private masques and other entertainments, but the cities, increasingly at odds with the monarchy, would no longer play along. The Duchy of Lorraine, a great centre of all festivities, was swallowed up in the Thirty Years War, which left much of Northern and Central Europe in no mood or condition for celebrations on the old scale. In France the concentration of power in royal hands, begun by Richelieu, left city elites distrustful of the monarchy, and once Louis XIV succeeded to the throne, royal progresses stopped completely for over fifty years; in their place Louis staged his elaborate court fêtes, redolent of cultural propaganda, which were memorialised in sumptupously illustrated volumes that the \"Cabinet du Roi\" placed in all the right hands.\n\nChanges in the intellectual climate meant the old allegories no longer resonated with the population. The assassinations of both Henry III and Henry IV of France, of William the Silent and other prominent figures, and the spread of guns, made rulers more cautious about appearing in slow-moving processions planned and publicised long in advance; at grand occasions for fireworks and illuminations, rulers now characteristically did no more than show themselves at a ceremonial window or balcony. The visit of Louis XVI to inspect the naval harbour works at Cherbourg in 1786 seems, amazingly, to have been the first French entry of a King designed as a public event since the early years of Louis XIV well over a century before. Though considered a great success, this was certainly too little and too late to avoid the catastrophe awaiting the French monarchy.\n\nIdeologues of the French Revolution took the semi-private fête of the former court and made it public once more, in events like the \"Fête de la Raison\". Under Napoleon, the Treaty of Tolentino (1797) requisitioned from the Papacy a mass of works of art, including most of the famous sculptures of Roman antiquity in the Vatican. A Joyous Entry under the name of a fête was arranged for the arrival of the cultural loot in Paris, the carefully prepared \"Fête de la Liberté\" of 1798. With the increased sense of public security of the 19th century, Entries became grander again, on such occasions as the Visit of King George IV to Scotland, where medieval revivalism makes its first appearance, along with much Highland romanticism, Queen Victoria's visits to Dublin and elsewhere, or the three Delhi Durbars. On these occasions, though ceremonial acts remained meaningful, overt allegories never regained the old prominence, and the decorations receded into festive, but simply decorative affairs of flags, flowers and bunting, the last remnant of the medieval show of rich textiles along the processional route.\n\nToday, though many parades and processions have quite separate, independent origins, civic or republican equivalents of the Entry continue. They include Victory parades, New York's traditional ticker-tape parades and the Lord Mayor's Show in London, dating back to 1215 and still preserving the Renaissance car, or float model. It is not frivolous to add that the specific occasion of the contemporary American Thanksgiving Day Parade or the Santa Claus parade is the triumphal entry into the city of Santa Claus in his sleigh.\n\nTo the occasional irritation of modern art historians, many of the great artists of the time spent a good deal of time on the ephemeral decorations for entries and other festivities, including Jan van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Holbein, Andrea del Sarto, Perino del Vaga, Polidoro da Caravaggio, Tintoretto, Veronese and Rubens. For some court artists, such as Inigo Jones or Jacques Bellange, it seems to have been their major occupation, and both Giulio Romano and Giorgio Vasari were very heavily engaged in such work. Composers from Lassus and Monteverdi to John Dowland, and writers such as Tasso, Ronsard, Ben Jonson and Dryden also contributed. Shakespeare does not seem to have written anything for such an occasion, but with Jonson he was one of a group of twenty gentlemen processing in \"The Magnificent Entertainment\", as the published record called the first entry of James I of England into London.\n\nArt historians also detect the influence of the tableau in many paintings, especially in the late Middle Ages, before artists had trained themselves to be able to develop new compositions readily. In the Renaissance, artists were often imported from other cities to help with, or supervise, the works, and entries probably helped the dissemination of styles.\n\nA festival book is an account of festivities such as entries, of which there are many hundreds, often surviving in very few copies. Originally manuscripts, often illustrated, compiled for prince or city, with the arrival of print they were frequently published, varying in form from short pamphlets describing the order of events, and perhaps recording speeches, to lavish books illustrated with woodcuts or engravings showing the various tableaux, often including a fold-out panorama of the procession, curling to and fro across the page. The pamphlets were ephemera themselves; a printed description of two leaves describing the entry of Ferdinand into Valladolid, 1513, survives in a single copy (at Harvard) because it was bound with another text. A lost description of the ceremonious reception given by Louis XII to Ferdinand at Savona (June 1507) is only known from a purchase receipt of Ferdinand Columbus.\n\nThese \"livrets\" are not always to be trusted as literal records; some were compiled beforehand from the plans, and others after the event from fading memories. The authors or artists engaged in producing the books had by no means always seen the entry themselves. Roy Strong finds that they are \"an idealization of an event, often quite distant from its reality as experienced by the average onlooker. One of the objects of such publications was to reinforce by means of word and image the central ideas that motivated those who conceived the programme.\" One Habsburg entry was all but called off because of torrential rain, but the book shows it as it should have been. Thomas Dekker, the playwright and author of the book on \"The Magnificent Entertainment\" for James I is refreshingly frank:\n\nThe Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I, went a step further, creating enormous virtual triumphs that existed solely in the form of print. The \"Triumphs of Maximilian\" (begun in 1512 and unfinished at Maximilian's death in 1519) contains over 130 large woodcuts by Dürer and other artists, showing a huge procession (still in open country) culminating in the Emperor himself, mounted on a huge car. \"The Triumphal Arch\" (1515), the largest print ever made, at 3.57 x 2.95 metres when the 192 sheets are assembled, was produced in an edition of seven hundred copies for distribution to friendly cities and princes. It was intended to be hand-coloured and then pasted to a wall. Traditional tableau themes, including a large genealogy, and many figures of Virtues, are complemented by scenes of Maximilian's life and military victories. Maximilian was wary of entries in person, having been locked up by his loyal subjects in Bruges in 1488 for eleven weeks, until he could pay the bills from his stay.\n\nAn early meeting between the festival book with travel literature is the account of the visit in 1530 of the future Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, then King of Hungary and Bohemia to Constantinople.\n\nIn Habsburg territories in the New World, the \"entradas\" of the Viceroy of Mexico were celebrated at his landing at Veracruz and at Mexico City; on the way, the ceremonial entry at the \"second city\", Puebla de los Ángeles, which were presented as late as 1696, served to promote an elite that self-identified strongly with Spain, and incurred expenses, which were borrowed from the ecclesiastic \"cabildo\", that exceeded the annual income of the city. Printed commemorative pamphlets spelled out in detail the elaborately artificial allegories and hieroglyphic emblems of the Entry, often drawn from astrology, in which the Viceroy would illuminate the city as the sun. In the 18th century, the Bourbon transformation of \"entrées\" into semi-private \"fêtes\" extended to Spanish Mexico: \"While the event continued to be extravagant under Bourbon rule, it became more privatized and took place to a larger degree indoors, losing its street theater flavor and urban processional character.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The trick has also been used by magicians Carl Hertz, Harry Beardmore, Harry Blackstone (Sr. and Jr.) John Mulholland, John Angel, Sabrina Vera, and Tommy Wonder.\n\nThe magician displays a bird cage, holding it between both of his hands. The cage is rectangular, about six inches tall by six inches wide by eight inches long, and made of wire on all six sides. Often there is a bird, though in modern performances of the act it is usually fake, inside the cage. The magician will offer the cage for inspection by an audience member, but he will never actually release his grip of it. Then, without covering the cage, the magician makes a sudden motion and the cage (and anything inside) vanishes from sight.\nA variation of the trick was featured in the 2006 film \"The Prestige\".\n\nThe bird cage is designed to collapse if it is not supported from both ends. Two of the opposite corners of the cage pull away from each other so that the box becomes somewhat of a tube, about 18 inches long and only one or two inches thick, that resembles a bundle of wire that is thicker in the middle than at the ends. An elastic cord attached to one end of the cage runs up the sleeve of the magician's jacket so that when the cage collapses, it is drawn up his sleeve and hidden from view. As a living bird is likely to be injured or killed when the cage collapses, fake birds are most commonly used in modern presentations of the vanishing bird cage.\n\n"}

{"id": "1968876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968876", "title": "Video game clone", "text": "Video game clone\n\nA video game clone is either a video game (or series) which is very similar to or heavily inspired by a previous popular game or series.\n\nThe term is usually derogatory, implying a lack of originality and creativity; however, an intentional clone may be anything from a \"ripoff\" to an honorary homage to its exemplar. Accusing a game of being a clone carries the implication that its developers or publishers try to profit off of the exemplar's success. In particularly bad cases this may be seen as a form of plagiarism or fraud and could be taken to court.\n\nCloning a game in digital marketplaces is common, because it is hard to prevent and easy to compete with existing games. Developers can copyright the graphics, title, story, and characters, but they cannot easily protect software design and game mechanics. A patent for the mechanics is possible, but acquiring one is expensive and time-consuming.\n\nWithin the field of video games, popular game concepts often lead to that concept becoming incorporated or expanded upon by other developers. In other cases, games may be developed with clear influence from one or more earlier games. Such derivations are not always considered clones though the term may be used to make a comparison between games. As copyright law does not protect gameplay concepts, the reuse of such ideas is generally considered acceptable. Games like \"Tetris\" and \"Breakout\" inspired many games that used similar core concepts but expanded beyond that; the \"Breakout\"-inspired \"Arkanoid\" itself inspired many other clones that built upon its unique additions to \"Breakout\". Gameplay elements of \"Street Fighter II\" and \"Mortal Kombat\" became common gameplay elements in the fighting game genre, A large number of games that tried to capitalize on the success of the 3D adventure game \"Myst\" were grouped as \"Myst clones\". Some video game genres are founded by archetypal games of which all subsequent similar games are considered derivatives; notably, early first-person shooters were often called \"\"Doom\" clones\", while the success of the open-world formula in \"Grand Theft Auto\" led to the genre of GTA clones. The genre of endless runners is based on the success and simplicity of the game \"Canabalt\". In these cases, games that are \"clones\" of another are generally not implied to have committed any intellectual property infractions, and otherwise considered legally acceptable practices, although calling such games clones is generally considered derogatory.\n\nTrue video games clones occur when competitors, on seeing the success of a video game title, attempt to compete by creating a near-copy of the existing game with similar assets and gameplay with little additional innovation; developer Jenova Chen compared the nature of these clones similar to plagiarism in which there is little attempt to distinguish the new work from the original. \"BYTE\" reported in December 1981 that at least eight clones of Atari, Inc.'s arcade game \"Asteroids\" existed for personal computers. The magazine stated in December 1982 that that year \"few games broke new ground in either design or format ... If the public really likes an idea, it is milked for all it's worth, and numerous clones of a different color soon crowd the shelves. That is, until the public stops buying or something better comes along. Companies who believe that microcomputer games are the hula hoop of the 1980s only want to play Quick Profit.\" Video game clones are seen by those developing them as low risk; knowing that a game or genre is popular, developing a clone of that game would appear to be a safe and quick investment, in contrast with developing a new title with unknown sales potential.\n\nSuch cloning of video games initially bore out from arcade games, buoyed by the success of that sector during its \"golden age\" in the early 1980s. Cloning would continue as home video game consoles became popular, and in part, the number of clones being produced and saturating the market were considered part of the reason for the video game market crash in 1983. A new resurgence in cloned video games came with the rise of social network games, typically which were offered as freemium titles to entice new players to play.\n\nMore recently, the cost, ease and simplicity of the tools needed to develop mobile games has made cloning in that sector a significant problem. For example, \"Flappy Bird\" had been cloned dozens of times due to programming code clearinghouses offering templated code to which others could easily add their own art assets. The creators of \"Threes!\" spent 14 months developing the game and tuning its mechanics, but the first clone was released 21 days after \"Threes!\" and the original was quickly overshadowed by \"2048\", a clone that was developed over a weekend.\n\nIn 1981 Atari, Inc. warned in full-page advertisements \"Piracy: This Game is Over\", stating that the company \"will protect its rights by vigorously enforcing [its] copyrights and by taking appropriate action against unauthorized entities who reproduce or adapt substantial copies of ATARI games\", like a home-computer clone. In present-day law, it is nonetheless held that game mechanics of a video game are part of its software, and are generally ineligible for copyright. The United States Copyright Office specifically notes: \"Copyright does not protect the idea for a game, its name or title, or the method or methods for playing it. Nor does copyright protect any idea, system, method, device, or trademark material involved in developing, merchandising, or playing a game. Once a game has been made public, nothing in the copyright law prevents others from developing another game based on similar principles.\" The underlying source code, and the game's artistic elements, including art, music, and dialog, can be protected by copyright law. In the United Kingdom, \"neither a game’s ‘look and feel’ nor its mechanics are protectable\", according to Nicolas Murfett, a legal associate for Harbottle & Lewis, while the European Union has yet to come to a resolution on the matter. As an alternative, some elements of video game software have been protected through patents or trademarks.\n\nIt is generally recognized in the video game industry that borrowing mechanics from other games is common practice, and their widespread use would make them ineligible for legal copyright or patent protection. Courts also consider \"scènes à faire\" (French for \"scenes that must be done\") for a particular genre as uncopyrightable; games involving vampires, for example, would be expected to have elements of the vampire drinking blood and driving a stake through the vampire's heart to kill him. Up until 2012, courts were reluctant to find for copyright infringement of clones; attorney Stephen C. McArthur, writing for \"Gamasutra\", said that courts opted to take a more lax view to balance innovation in the industry and prevent overzealous copyright protection that could have one company claim copyright on an entire genre of games.\n\nA shift in legal options for developers to challenge clones arose from the 2012 federal court decision that ruled in favor of the Tetris Company, the owners of the \"Tetris\" copyright, over the clone \"Mino\" which used the same gameplay as \"Tetris\" but with different art assets. The developers for \"Mino\" has cited in their defense that they only used the uncopyrightable gameplay elements of \"Tetris\" in \"Mino\". The court ruled that copyright law was in favor of the Tetris Company's claim, as the gameplay was copied without changes, and while the art assets were new, the \"look and feel\" of \"Mino\" could be easily confused for that of \"Tetris\". This decision serves as case law for other developers to fend off \"look-and-feel\" clones. Similarly, SpryFox LLC, the developers of the mobile game \"Triple Town\", successfully defended their game from a clone, \"Yeti Town\", developed by 6Waves, through court settlement after the judge gave initially rulings in favor of SpryFox; these rulings suggested that there was copyright protection on the gameplay mechanics despite drastic differences in the games' art assets, though other factors, such as prior agreements between SpryFox and 6Waves, may have also been involved.\n\nOther notable legal actions involving video game clones include:\n\n\nMore recently, with the popularity of social and mobile game stores like Apple's App Store for iOS system and Google Play for Android-based systems, a large number of likely-infringing clones have begun appearing. While such storefronts typically include a review process before games and apps can be offered on them, these processes do not consider copyright infringement of other titles. Instead, they rely on the developer of the work that has been cloned to initiate a complaint regarding the clone, which may take time for review. The cloned apps often are purposely designed to resemble other popular apps by name or feel, luring away purchasers from the legitimate app, even after complaints have been filed. Apple has released a tool to streamline claims of app clones to a team dedicated to handle these cases, helping to bring the two parties together to try to negotiate prior to action. While Apple, Google, and Microsoft took steps to stem the mass of clones based on \"Swing Copters\" after its release, experts believe it is unlikely that these app stores will institute any type of proactive clone protection outside of clear copyright violations, and these experts stress the matter is better done by the developers and gaming community to assure the original developer is well known, protects their game assets on release, and gets the credit for the original game.\n\nAnother approach some companies have used to prevent clones is via trademarks as to prevent clones and knockoffs. Notably, King have gotten a United States trademark on the word \"Candy\" in the area of video games to protect clones and player confusion for their game \"Candy Crush Saga\". They have also sought to block the use of the word \"Saga\" in the trademark filing of \"The Banner Saga\" for similar reasons, despite the games having no common elements. Within the European Union, one can register for a European Union trade mark that includes multimedia elements, which would allow a developer or publisher to trademark a specific gameplay element that is novel from past games, providing a different route for them to protect their work from cloning. For example, Rebellion Developments filed to register its \"Kill Cam\" mechanic as a trademark from its series \"Sniper Elite\" in October 2017, though as of February 2018, the application is still being reviewed.\n\n"}
{"id": "1312856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1312856", "title": "Yoshimoto Kogyo", "text": "Yoshimoto Kogyo\n\nYoshimoto is said to be almost single-handedly responsible for the development of Japanese manzai after World War II and, in fact, the kanji that are now used for the word \"manzai\" were introduced by Yoshimoto in 1933, spelling a new era for the comedy style. Although pure \"manzai\" is no longer the dominant form of entertainment in Japan, Yoshimoto's influence remains and the spirit of \"manzai\" lives on in modern Japanese comedy, as can be seen by the prevalence of the Kansai dialect in many \"owarai\" productions.\n\nThe current director of Yoshimoto is Isao Yoshino, who replaced the long-standing ex-senior director Masao Kimura in January 2005. Kimura had been part of the company since entering in 1969, and in the 35 plus years that Kimura worked with Yoshimoto, it expanded greatly and its reputation as a successful company grew enormously. Fresh out of university, Yoshimoto is still the goal for many young comedians, and many of them hope to be accepted into the 'New Star Creation' school in Osaka, or one of others across Japan.\n\nYoshimoto now boasts more than 650 entertainers, possibly the most famous being the \"owarai\" \"kombi\" (duo) Downtown, successors of the \"manzai\" duo Yasu-Kiyo in the 1980s. As in much of Japanese culture, there exists a strong bond between senpai (senior) and kōhai (junior) members of the entertainment industry. Many lower level employees of Yoshimoto do not receive full salaries but rather benefit from the advice and guidance of senior members of the company.\n\n\n\nYoshimoto has been expanding its business in recent years, due to the so-called <nowiki>'</nowiki>\"warai\" boom'. They now have their own comedy theme park in Otaru, Hokkaido and have begun signing the likes of musicians, producers, athletes and singers alongside business with the Japanese \"owarai\" industry.\n\nYoshimoto Kogyo is the owner of a number of corporate offices and stages, most situated in the downtown areas of Osaka and Tokyo. The company has two headquarters, Osaka HQ (大阪本部) and Tokyo HQ (東京本部) and a number of stages, namely Lumine the Yoshimoto (ルミネtheよしもと), 5 up Yoshimoto (5upよしもと), NMB48 Theater (NMB48劇場), Nanba Grand Kagetsu (なんばグランド花月), and a new stage in the popular Shibuya district of Tokyo, Yoshimoto Mugendai Hall (ヨシモト∞ホール). Yoshimoto also had a comedy museum in downtown Osaka called Yoshimoto Shōtengai (吉本笑店街), but it closed in 2009.\n\nYoshimoto Kogyo also owns a community FM radio station, YES-fm 78.1 (callsign: JOZZ7AF-FM), based in Namba, Osaka.\n\n\n"}
