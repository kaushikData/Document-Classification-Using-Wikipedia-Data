{"id": "37071533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37071533", "title": "Berdjoang", "text": "Berdjoang\n\nBerdjoang (literally \"struggle\", also known under the title Hope of the South) is a 1943 film from the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). The film, produced by the Japanese studio Nippon Eigasha, is credited as having been directed by Rd. Ariffien, although Ariffien may have actually served as an assistant. Starring Mohamad Mochtar, Sambas, Dhalia, Kartolo, and Chatir Harro, it follows several villagers and their different approaches to Japanese military rule. The propaganda film was meant to draw Indonesians to enter a Japanese-sponsored army and survives, in part, in the Netherlands.\n\nIn Legok, a Japanese spokesman gives a speech regarding the formation of military units for native Indonesians. Two village boys, the best friends Saman (Sambas) and Anang (Mohamad Mochtar), try to join the army. Saman is not accepted owing to a lame leg, but Anang begins training. Saman, meanwhile, begins working indirectly for the Japanese occupation government by taking up work at a food company.\n\nWhile Anang is away, the university-educated Ahmad (Chatir Harro), a fellow villager, express interest in Anang's girlfriend, Saman's sister Hasanah (Dahlia). Hasanah is not interested as she considers him ill-mannered and lazy. She tells him he should join the army, something Ahmad refuses to do. Saman, who has proven himself with his diligence, is promoted and eventually marries his boss's daughter, Nani (R.A. Pulunggana).\n\nOne day, Anang – now a unit leader – returns to the village with several of his men. He sees that Saman has been unable to join the army and thus apologises, as he considers their actions as children responsible for Saman's injuries. Their discussion is interrupted by cries of \"Thief!\" from outside; they rush out and see that Ahmad has been caught stealing from Saman's factory. Although Saman hits Ahmad several times, he refuses to press charges against the thief. Anang then takes his leave to go back to the army.\n\nThe Empire of Japan began occupying the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) in early 1942. The country's film industry was essentially shut down: all but one film studio was closed. The Japanese film studio Nippon Eigasha established a branch in the Indies. This was the company which produced \"Berdjoang\". The film was one of several Japanese propaganda films produced during the period; \"Berjoang\" was aimed at enticing Indonesians to join the army.\n\n\"Berdjoang\" was produced by the Japanese-sponsored Nippon Eigasha. It is credited as having been written and directed by Rd. Ariffien, but the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that a Japanese man named Kurata Bunjin was the actual director, with Rd. Ariffien as his assistant. It starred Mohamad Mochtar, Sambas, Dhalia, Kartolo, and Chatir Harro. Hajopan Bajo Angin was artistic director. The black-and-white film had Indonesian and Japanese-language dialogue. Filming started on 1 September 1943, with Siat Yu Ming on camera.\n\nThe film departed from the rising intellectual movement of works produced domestically in 1940 and 1941; these films had shown university students, depicted by well-educated actors, as heroes, while \"Berdjoang\" relegated the intellectual elite to the realm of petty criminals.\n\n\"Berdjoang\" was released in 1943. It was the only domestically-produced feature film released in the Dutch East Indies; Nippon Eigasha and Persafi did, however, make five short films as well as several newsreels before the Japanese surrendered in August 1945.\n\nThe film is one of several Japanese propaganda films have survived, in whole or in part, at the Netherlands Government Information Service. A ten-minute reel, thought to be the fourth act, was discovered in Jakarta and brought to the Netherlands, where it is now stored at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. This extract was screened at the 1997 Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival, during a feature on Japanese newsreels and other productions during the occupation of the Indies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1443960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1443960", "title": "Castlevania: Curse of Darkness", "text": "Castlevania: Curse of Darkness\n\nCastlevania: Curse of Darkness action adventure game developed by Konami for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Despite development for both PlayStation 2 and Xbox, only the PlayStation 2 version was released in Japan. An Xbox version was released throughout Asia under the NTSC-J Format, with English language dialogue. A manga adaptation was also published by Tokyopop.\n\nBeing a 3D game like \"\" before it, \"Curse of Darkness\" differs from its predecessor in a number of ways. It includes a more complex, action/adventure style of gameplay, much like \"Symphony of the Night\" and \"Aria of Sorrow\". Hector is not a member of the Belmont clan, so he does not use the \"Vampire Killer\" whip; instead he has the ability (much like Alucard and Soma Cruz) to equip a variety of different weapons ranging from swords (both one handed and two handed), spears, axes (also both one handed and two handed), brass knuckles and an extra type called special weapons (which varies from tonfas to gatling guns). However, there is an extra gameplay mode after finishing the game that allows players to play as Trevor Belmont, equipped with the \"Vampire Killer\" and the subweapons which are the knife, axe, holy water, cross, and stopwatch. The battle system is somewhat similar to that of Dynasty Warriors, whereas one button is used for standard combo attacks, and a secondary button is used for stronger \"finishing attacks\" after a singular standard attack or a combo of standard attacks. As the player acquires progressively stronger weapons throughout the game, the number of standard and finishing attacks the player can perform increases accordingly. Each different weapon type has a different set of combos that can be performed.\n\nDeparting from the central hub level layout of \"Lament of Innocence\", wherein the player chooses from a number of distinct stages all accessible from a central hallway, \"Curse of Darkness\" features a more complete game world with a complete castle map as in \"Symphony of the Night\". However, the game still uses the same map engine as \"Lament of Innocence\", rather than the square-based grid of 2D Castlevanias. Furthermore, a noticeable difference in level design is that much of the game does not take place in Dracula's castle, but rather exploring forests, mountains, temples, aqueducts, ruins, and villages in Europe. The player will be also aided by \"Innocent Devils\", which are demonic creatures developed by Hector himself through the Devil Forgery skill, in order to defeat enemies and solve puzzles within the game. They're similar to Alucard's Familiars in \"Symphony of the Night\", however they level up and evolve together with Hector. The Innocent Devils (commonly referred as I.D.'s) come in 6 different types. Each I.D. gives specifics bonuses to Hector's stats.\n\nIn PS2 version only, the player can get the Moai statue. This item can only be obtained if the player has a cleared save file of Castlevania: Lament of Innocence on their memory card. Conversely, load times are faster in the Xbox version.\n\n\"Curse of Darkness\" is set in the year 1479, three years after the events of \"\". Though defeated by vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, Dracula's curse continues to ravage the European countryside, spreading disease, mob violence, and heresy in its wake. Amidst all this devastation is Hector, a Devil Forgemaster who had formerly worked under the employ of Dracula but betrayed him sometime during the events of \"Castlevania III\". Eventually growing disgusted with Dracula's brutal methods, Hector leaves Castlevania and relinquishes his powers to live amongst humans, settling down to live a peaceful life. When Hector's fiancée Rosaly is accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake, Hector learns that her murder was directed by his rivalrous Devil Forgemaster, Isaac. Seeking revenge, Hector chases his former colleague back to his old home, and back to the demonic life he believed he had left behind him.\n\nWhen the game begins, Hector arrives at an Abandoned Castle to confront Isaac. The latter scoffs at his desire for revenge and dares him to regain his powers so they can settle their score in a satisfying way. Hector reluctantly accepts the challenge, and starts hunting his former friend across the Transylvanian countryside. During his quest, he encounters several people: Julia Laforeze, a young witch in exile who turns out to be Isaac's sister, Trevor Belmont, who distrusts him for being a Devil Forgemaster, Zead, a kindly holyman who provides him with reliable information about Isaac's whereabouts, and St. Germain, a mysterious time traveller who presses him to abandon his quest, but eventually leaves him alone with some cryptic comments about a \"new destiny\" having emerged for him.\n\nAt one point, Trevor decides to trust Hector, and uses his own blood to unlock a parallel world called the Infinite Corridor, where Isaac is supposedly hiding. However, when Hector fights a Dullahan there, an evil glyph channels his energy and uses it to summon a new incarnation of Dracula's castle. Isaac, who intended this all along, cruelly stabs Trevor and leaves him for dead.\n\nHector enters the new Castlevania, where he fights and defeats his nemesis. As he prepares to kill him in a fit of rage, he suddenly remembers Julia, who had warned him not to let the Curse take hold of him. Horrified, Hector realizes that his actions are being controlled by Dracula's Curse. A triumphant Zead appears and confirms this, explaining that the Devil Forgemasters were supposed to fight to the death, with the blood-stained Hector becoming the vessel for the Count's reincarnation. Having secured Isaac's body for this purpose, he reveals himself to be Death and attacks, in vain. Hector proceeds to fight Dracula, who is unable to take full control of Isaac's body and returns to the afterlife. Hector then uses his powers as a Devil Forgemaster to lift the Curse. Julia comes to his rescue, and they start a new life together. Meanwhile, St. Germain departs for the distant future, wondering how the struggle between mankind and Dracula will end.\n\nIt was produced by Koji Igarashi (also known as \"IGA\"), who has worked on several other games in the \"Castlevania\" series, including \"\", \"\" and \"\". Also returning are series artist Ayami Kojima and composer Michiru Yamane.\n\nMichiru Yamane once again composes the music. Guitars, which were omitted from Lament of Innocence's score, have returned in Curse of Darkness. There was a sampler given away as a bonus to anyone who pre-ordered a copy of Castlevania: Curse of Darkness from supporting retailers.\n\nAnimaze has done the English language-voicework for the Characters.\n\nThe game was generally well received, generating mid to high review scores. Common praises often go to the game's battle system – which as stated by IGN \"...can offer up a fairly wide variety of skirmishes and strategies...\" -, the Innocent Devil system and musical score. Common criticisms of the game go to the game's environments, which have generally been considered dull and repetitive. X-Play gave Curse of Darkness a 3 out of 5 while IGN gave it a 7.8, or \"Good\" rating. GamePro Magazine gave the game a 4.0 out of a 5.0 fun factor, stating that it was a game that got more intriguing as it goes on. GameSpot rated it 6.8, saying it looked good and had solid controls, but the level design was \"monotonous\". \"Game Informer\"s Tim Turi felt that it was \"decent\" but did not feel like it captured the \"overall style and atmosphere\" of other \"Castlevania\" games.\n\nAdapted and illustrated by Kou Sasakura, a two-volume manga adaptation titled was published in Japan from 2005 to 2006. Taking place between the events of \"\" and \"Castlevania: Curse of Darkness\", the manga centers on Isaac and Hector. Tokyopop licensed it for English-language release in North America. The first volume, (), was released September 1, 2008, and the second, (), was published January 1, 2009. It is also licensed in France by Soleil Manga.\n\n\"Castlevania: Curse of Darkness\" was positively received by English-language readers. The first volume ranked 72nd on the list of the top 100 best-selling graphic novels in September 2008 with an estimated 1,564 copies sold. In December 2008, the second volume placed 171st on the list of the top 300 best-selling graphic novels with an estimated 720 copies sold. However, it received mixed reviews from English-language critics—two of whom were fans of the Castlevania franchise. Criticism focused on Sasakura's artwork which tended to focus on close-ups and neglect the backgrounds, and the lack of fleshed-out characters. Mania Entertainment's Nadia Oxford disliked having a child as one of the main characters, calling it \"unnecessary pandering to a younger audience\" and concluding that \"It's disappointing to see Castlevania thrown to a kid like so many other great properties.\" Conversely, another reviewer described it as \"a fairly well done vampire comic book\" with a \"pitch perfect mood\" and pleasant artwork, and About.com's Deb Aoki ranked it fifteenth on her list of the twenty-two best vampire manga.\n\n\n"}

In MMA fights are competed over, in contrast to professional wrestling where the outcomes and moves performed are often scripted or predetermined. Despite the differences in competition, there have been people that have competed in both professional wrestling and MMA. \nProfessional wrestling could be considered a performance art which combines athletics with theatrical performance. Matches are contested on a pre-determined basis, where the fight on display is merely for entertainment purposes. Viewers are integral to a professional wrestling match, as the audience is who the action is for. Professional wrestling mixes many styles of amateur wrestling, striking and showmanship to display a fight, whilst the two performers work together to achieve a \"worked\" fight. Professional wrestling was first popularized in the 19th century Europe as a carnival attraction.\n\nMixed Martial Arts, is a hybrid of many types of physical full-contact sports; including wrestling, boxing and Martial Arts, such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The early 1990s saw the Ultimate Fighting Championship popularize the term \"Mixed Martial Arts\", for such a bout. Competitors in MMA are generally skilled in many different styles, however, it is possible to be only proficient in one type of combat. As some professional wrestling moves are simply worked versions of legitimate holds, there can be a crossover between the two.\n\nPossibly the most successful pro wrestler and MMA star is Brock Lesnar, who has won the world championships in both the WWE and UFC. Other wrestlers to have won a championship in both MMA and Pro Wrestling include Bobby Lashley (Shark Fights Heavyweight Championship as well as the Impact Global Championship), and Dan Severn who won the UFC Superfight Championship, and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nSince MMA's rise to prominence in the 1990s, some pro wrestlers or MMA fighters have been cynical against the other's profession. This can be an attack on the sport as a whole, or acting as a fan dismissing certain actions within that sport.\n\nBelow is a list of professional wrestlers to have appeared in an official Mixed Martial Arts match; as well as their career win/loss record.

{"id": "5459290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5459290", "title": "Cringe comedy", "text": "Cringe comedy\n\nCringe comedy is a specific genre of comedy that derives humor from social awkwardness. Often a cringe comedy will have an air of a mockumentary and revolve around a serious setting, such as a workplace, to lend the comedy a sense of reality.\n\nThe protagonists are typically egotists who overstep the boundaries of political correctness and break social norms. Then the comedy will attack the protagonist by not letting them become aware of their self-centered view, or by making them oblivious to the ego-deflation that the comedy deals them. Sometimes, however, an unlikable protagonist may not suffer any consequences, which violates people's moral expectations, and also makes the audience cringe.\n\nHumour theorist Noël Carroll explains humour in relation to incongruity theory and annoyance: \"Imagine the cutlery laid out for a formal dinner. Suppose that the salad fork is in the wrong place. If you are the sort of person who is disturbed by such deviations from the norm, you will not be capable of finding this amusing. On the other hand, if you are more easy-going about such matters and also aware of the incongruity, it may elicit a chuckle. That is, you may find the error amusing or not. But if you find it genuinely amusing you cannot find it annoying.\"\n\nPopular examples of television programmes that employ this genre of comedy include \"Seinfeld\", \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\", \"Mr. D\", \"The Larry Sanders Show\", \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\",\"Friday Night Dinner\", \"Arrested Development\", \"The Office\", \"Da Ali G Show\", \"The Comeback\", \"Parks and Recreation\", \"Modern Family\", \"Miranda\", \"People Just Do Nothing\", \"Mr Bean\", \"Louie\", \"Girls\", \"The Mindy Project\", \"The Inbetweeners\", \"Peep Show\", \"The IT Crowd\", \"Nathan for You\", \"The Last Man on Earth\", \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\", \"The Eric Andre Show\", \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\", \"Impractical Jokers\", \"Who is America?\", and \"Veep\".\n"}
{"id": "6627226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6627226", "title": "Dark Reign 2", "text": "Dark Reign 2\n\nDark Reign 2 is a 3D real-time strategy Microsoft Windows game released on June 30, 2000 by Activision and Pandemic Studios. Being a prequel to \"\", \"Dark Reign 2\"'s storyline focuses on what has come before the conflict in the first \"Dark Reign\". The game features three modes: campaign, online multiplayer and an instant action mode.\n\nThe two opposing factions introduced in \"Dark Reign 2\" are the Sprawlers (which later evolve to be the \"Freedom Guard\" faction of \"Dark Reign\") and the Jovian Detention Authority a.k.a. JDA (which evolve to be the \"Imperium\" faction). The two sides are caught up in a conflict spanning Earth's 26th (and final) century. In the Intro, a Sprawler Leader who interacts with the player in the Sprawler campaign quotes:\n\nThe struggle between the Sprawlers and JDA is, at its heart, the struggle between authority and freedom, government and proletariat. As the earth reeled into ecological collapse, the JDA established large dome cities to protect the citizenry from the harsh conditions outside. However, they left behind all those who would not succumb to their dictatorial will: the Sprawlers. The disenfranchised Sprawlers are thus left in the outside world, bathed in the harsh conditions of a dying planet and fueled by the explosive rage of rebels fighting for a free life under the thumb of a cold overlord. Thus, the Sprawlers desperately fight to break into the dome cities, while the JDA desperately sally out into the decaying 'Sprawl' to keep them out and in a state of submission.\n\nThe player can choose to play either the Sprawlers or the JDA campaigns, both with similarities and differences to the overall story. If the player chooses the Sprawlers, he/she is referred to as \"Sirdar\", a new member of the council eager to prove him/herself. If the player chooses the JDA, he/she is a member of strike force, guided by the JDA central AI, \"CYGNET\". Both sides are concerned with the massive increase in seismic activity around the world which is consuming it and each other. As the story progresses, both sides gain access to new units and structures which the player will need to use in order to proceed further and develop more powerful strategies.\n\nThe Sprawlers are running low on numbers and have been on the defensive for a long time. The council heavily squabbles on going offensive or staying defensive, noting they can't stay on the defensive forever. A new Sirdar (the player) begins by aiding them in a more important offensive than the skirmishes of recent, hacking a communication centre feeding a city zone JDA propaganda so that the Sprawlers can spread their own message. They are the first to notice that seismic activity on Earth is increasing on a global scale and taking advantage by making a strike on a crippled base, bringing their first victory.\n\nDuring the quake, they discover that the door seal of Togra's shrine, the research lab of the great Togra himself, has opened despite only being openable by Togra. According to legends, the breaking of the seal signals the beginning of a chain of events. The Sirdar must then send forces through icey mountains to rescue the Voodun high priest, Booda Shun, from JDA captivity and take him to the shrine so he can examine the site.\n\nAfter interpreting the site, Booda Shun brings disturbing news. The breaking of the seal indicates that Earth's time is limited and \"the planet is rolling toward a catastrophic collapse\", which will bring the end of everything. During the previous mission, JDA forces were snooping around the site, which indicates they may have find something or are making plans. Sirdar is ordered to hack into the nearby Cygnet relay station to see what the JDA have in mind. After infiltrating the station despite heavy resistance before and after, the station is destroyed and the council reviews the information.\n\nThe plans reveal the JDA are relocating massive numbers of citizens to the central dome. Activity in the area is increasing at phenomenal rates. The purpose is clear. The JDA are preparing to evacuate Earth, leaving the Sprawlers behind. The council is outraged. As one member says, \"First they ruin the planet and then they leave us to die with it.\" He declares death to the JDA and asks who is with him. With this, the whole council unites and puts their squabbling behind. But they find that the dome could have been assaulted easily years ago. Because of how much harder the direct way is to penetrate at the current time, they find the only possible way through is along the coast, which passes through two sub-factions, known as the Breks and the Judas.\n\nThe Sirdar is charged with leading the way. After securing the river and earning the Breks trust, thanks to new aerial and water technologies, they find the JDA have a secret weapons facility not far ahead from intel by their new allies. A prototype mobile bomb sits outside. Sirdar, if careful, is able to make off with three copies of the prototype, though only one is required. Then the sprawlers aid the Judas in taking out JDA forces that are thinning their numbers, gaining their trust.\n\nWith their forces built, the final missions involve storming the dome and preventing the JDA from being able to evacuate. If successful, the Sprawlers will become the dominant force and the JDA will be either severely crippled or destroyed.\n\nActivity in the city is going wild with sprawlers making regular skirmishes and setting up anti-air batteries that harass air traffic. The situation in Sector 13 is the worst. After being shot down by one of the batteries, Strike Force's first objective is to rescue a base from destruction, push back Sprawler forces and clearing all the anti-air batteries in the area so that an air strike can be performed on the Sprawler base. Along the way, the first earthquake occurs, almost destroying the base Strike Force rescues.\n\nIn the next mission, the JDA also discover Togra's shrine has been damaged in the quake. They wish to investigate. Strike Force captures a Voodun priest as a prisoner and force him to take them to the shrine. But along the way, powerful Togran pylons prevent movement up the hill without being destroyed. To deal with this, Strike Force deploys aerial infantry to destroy two Togran power generators in order to disable the pylons and proceed. At the site, they discover a strange mobile artifact, which resembles an ancient slab on a hovering platform. Cygnet indicates the higher up ranks wish to study the artifact and orders Strike Force to evacuate the artficat to a transporter.\n\nShortly after, radio chatter shows the evacuation plans are in effect and there is a state of panic. In one jungle area, a large JDA force is evacuating without authorization and are primarily concerned with themselves. Their plans make them abandon their post at a large powered gate, which is meant to prevent hordes of Sprawlers from entering the zone. Strike Force is sent in to deal with the cowards before they can escape, which is followed by pushing back the Sprawlers and building power generators on the gate, reactivating it. With the JDA's grip on the sector regained, Strike Force is relocated.\n\nIt is at that time found that there are three Togran artifacts. Strike Force is tasked with retrieving the second artifact hidden in a temple but along the way, encounter heavy resistance with suicidal cultists of unknown origin, as well as Baron Samedi's, traditionally a Sprawler power from the Shrine. Despite this, Strike force is able to locate and evacuate the artifact. Afterward, the challenge is on to find the third. This is achieved by a large offensive in Arctic mountains to capture Booda Shun, the Voodun High Priest, who reveals the location of the third artifact. Hidden in a city sector, Strike Force must find it before the Sprawlers do. The problem is not only pushing back the Sprawlers, but taking punishment from the frequent earthquakes in the zone.\n\nToward the end, the evacuation plan is in the final stages. However, the JDA does not wish for the artifacts to be taken into the hands of the Sprawlers, along with the Sprawlers leaving with them. They try to destroy all three artifacts, but can't for three reasons. First, a large destructive force is required to destroy them. Second, they have to be destroyed at the same time. Finally, destroying the artifacts will bring about the end of the world. During the final stage, as the last JDA citizens are being evacuated, Cygnet requests that Strike Force sacrifice themselves by remaining behind and destroying the artifacts, achieving this by gathering them around a large number of atomic energy plants before detonating them. It ends with the defeat of the Sprawlers, the salvation of the JDA, the destruction of Earth and the loss of Strike Force. This brings the JDA Campaign to a rather sad and abrupt end.\n\nThe game contains multiplayer functionality, allowing up to 32 players at once, featuring four 'rulesets\"; Gluttony, Protect HQ, Blood Bath, and Deathmatch. Blood Bath is a mode in which the first team to kill a certain number of units wins. Protect HQ (by far the most used) is a ruleset in which a player who loses their HQ for a certain period of time (about three minutes) loses. Gluttony is a condition where the first player to collect a certain amount of resources wins. Deathmatch is a ruleset in which a player who loses all of their units is defeated.\n\nPlayers are allowed to create custom mods for the game by making simple configuration files and using the packaging software which can be found on the original game CD.\n\nThe game has a built-in map editor and there are several tutorials available on the internet to create your own terrains.\n\nIn 2011, an unauthorized leak of the complete source code tree to the game was made to the Internet and posted to a Google Code repository by a claimed former Pandemic Studios developer under a LGPL license. A Hacker News user received confirmation from the repository owner that this was in fact a leak and not an officially sanctioned code release. The leak also included headers and code from 3rd-party sources with licenses that explicitly forbid public disclosure and redistribution.\n"}

In the case of an RGB color display, the derived unit of pixel pitch is a measure of the size of a triad plus the distance between triads. \n\nDot pitch may be measured in linear units (with smaller numbers meaning higher resolution), usually millimeters (mm), or as a rate, for example dots per inch (with a larger number meaning higher resolution). Closer spacing produces a sharper image (as there are more dots in a given area). However, other factors may affect image quality, including: \n\nThe exact difference between horizontal and diagonal dot pitch varies with the design of the monitor (see pixel geometry and widescreen), but a typical entry-level 0.28 mm (diagonal) monitor has a horizontal pitch of 0.24 or 0.25 mm, a good quality 0.26 mm (diagonal) unit has a horizontal pitch of 0.22 mm.\n\nThe above dot pitch measurement does not apply to aperture grille displays. Such monitors use continuous vertical phosphor bands on the screen, so the vertical distance between scan lines is limited only by video input signal's vertical resolution and the thickness of electron beam, so there is no vertical 'dot pitch' on such devices. Aperture grille only has horizontal 'dot pitch', or otherwise known as 'stripe pitch'.\n\n"}

With perfect play, if neither side can force a win, the game is a draw.\n\nSome games with relatively small game trees have been proven to be first or second-player wins.

In the traditional sense, this is carried on terrestrial radio signals and received with an antenna.\n\nFTA also refers to channels and broadcasters providing content for which no subscription is expected, even though they may be delivered to the viewer/listener by another carrier for which a subscription is required, e.g. cable, satellite or the Internet. These carriers may be mandated (or opt) in some geographies to deliver FTA channels even if a premium subscription is not present (providing the necessary equipment is still available), especially where FTA channels are expected to be used for emergency broadcasts, similar to the 112 emergency service provided by mobile phone operators and manufacturers.\n\nFree-to-view (FTV) is, generally, available without subscription but is digitally encoded and may be restricted geographically.\n\nFree-to-air is often used for international broadcasting, making it something of a video equivalent to shortwave radio.\nMost FTA retailers list free to air channel guides and content available in North America for free to air use.\n\nAlthough commonly described as free, the cost of free-to-air services is met through various means:\n\nIn Brazil the main FTA satellite is the Star One C2, it holds approximately 30 C-band analog channels, including all major networks like Rede Globo, SBT, Record, RedeTV!, Band and others, and 5 digital HDTV channels.+itv 1\n\nThere are a number of competing systems in use. Early adopters used C-band dishes several feet in diameter to receive analog microwave broadcasts, and later digital microwave broadcasts using the 3.7-4.2 GHz band. Today, although large C-band dishes can still receive some content, the 11.7-12.2 GHz is also used. Ku-band signals can be received using smaller dishes, often as small as under a meter in diameter, allowing FTA satellite to be picked up from smaller spaces such as apartment balconies (note, however, that these dishes are not quite as small as those commonly used for commercial services such as Dish Network, DirecTV, Bell ExpressVu, Shaw Direct, etc. Dishes intended for those services may not deliver an adequate signal on Ku-band). The European-developed DVB-S and DVB-S2 standards are the most commonly used broadcast methods, with analog transmissions almost completely discontinued as of mid-2014.\n\nThe most common North American sources for free-to-air DVB satellite television are:\n\nMost of these signals are carried by US satellites. There is little or no free Canadian DVB-S content available to users of medium-size dishes as much of the available Ku-band satellite bandwidth is occupied by pay-TV operators Shaw Direct and Bell TV, although larger C-band dishes can pick up some content. FTA signals may be scattered across multiple satellites, requiring a motor or multiple LNBs to receive everything. This differs from Europe, where FTA signals are commonly concentrated on a few specific satellites.\n\nAnother difference between North American FTA and FTA in most of the rest of the world is that in North America, very few of the available signals are actually intended for home viewers or other end-users. Instead, they are generally intended for reception by local television stations, cable system headends, or other commercial users. While it is generally thought to be legal for home viewers to view such transmissions as long as they are not encrypted, this means that there are several unique challenges to viewing FTA signals that are not present in other areas of the world. Among these are:\n\n\nThe largest groups of end-users for Ku-band free-to-air signals were initially the ethnic-language communities, as often free ethnic-language programming would be sponsored by Multilingual American Communities and their broadcasters. Depending on language and origin of the individual signals, North American ethnic-language TV is a mix of pay-TV, free-to-air and DBS operations. Today, many American broadcasters send a multitude of programming channels in many languages, spanning many new channels, so they can get National support, which ultimately leads to carriage by cable systems, to additionally support the high costs of broadcasting signals in this way.\n\nNevertheless, free-to-air satellite TV is a viable addition to home video systems, not only for the reception of specialized content but also for use in locations where terrestrial ATSC over-the-air reception is incomplete and additional channels are desired.\n\nAustralia has five major free-to-air networks: Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Seven Network, Nine Network, Network Ten, and Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). Traditionally each network had only a single channel in a geographic area, though with the advent of digital television each network now has SD multichannels 7TWO, 7mate, 7flix, 9Go!, 9Gem, 9Life, 10 Boss, 10 Peach, SBS Viceland and SBS Food respectively, and one HD networks simulcasting ABC HD, 7HD, 9HD, 10 HD and SBS HD respectively. With the exception of SBS, each commercial broadcaster also has one SD datacasting channel: Your Money, TVSN and Spree TV respectively; SBS instead broadcasts NITV free-to-air. The ABC is exempt from the policy limiting the number of multichannels, and currently runs three SD channels ABC, ABC Comedy, ABC ME, ABC News, and a primary channel which is simulcast on both analogue and digital. ABC and SBS channels are available across Australia; outside the major capital cities, regional affiliates provide channels that are essentially identical to the metropolitan commercial channels. In addition, community television provides one channel in some major cities.\n\nAustralia's two main government-owned TV channels, the ABC and SBS, along with the digital-only multichannels ABC Comedy, ABC ME and SBS Viceland, are both available free-to-air on the Optus D1 satellite. Viewers in remote parts of Australia could also access Seven Central and Imparja Television, or WIN WA and GWN7 in Western Australia, through the DVB-S free-to-view Optus Aurora service, which was replaced in December 2013 with the DVB-S2 free-to-view Optus VAST service.\n\nOther satellite-only channels such as Expo, Press TV and Al Jazeera English are available free-to-air on various satellites.\n\nNew Zealand has a number of FTA broadcasters such as Television New Zealand's TVNZ 1 and TV2, as well as MediaWorks New Zealand's TV3 and FOUR, Sky Network Television's Prime and the government subsidised the Māori Television and Te Reo channels.\n\nFour channels, TV One, TV2, TV3, FOUR are also broadcast timeshifted by +1 hour on Freeview and Sky platforms.\n\nA broadcast of parliament and a number of local channels, such as Cue TV are also available. Local stations such as CTV and Face TV (previously Triangle TV) were free-to-air analogue PAL transmissions prior to CTV migrating to the free-to-air digital DVB-T service and Face TV's terrestrial free-to-air service shutoff from December 2013.\n\nA digital terrestrial version of Freeview was launched in 2008, which, unlike the analogue and free-to-air satellite options, supports high-definition broadcasts for TV One, 2 and 3.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the largest and most dominant television channel, Television Broadcasts Limited, was the first free-to-air commercial television channel when it commenced broadcasting on 19 November 1967. It may also well be among the oldest and first station to broadcast over-the-air in East and Southeast Asia.\n\nIn Korea, KBS, MBC (the 2 main public broadcasters), SBS (privately owned, but available for free to viewers), and EBS (including both TV and radio) are the free-to-air broadcasting stations. They dominate more than 80% of advertisement profits, according to the recent survey from the agency .\nDue to the recent government's decision, digital television service for all free-to-air networks would be scheduled before the year 2012, followed by the end of analog television broadcasting.\n\nAround 600 FTA television channels and 180 Radio Channel are broadcast from ku-band and c-band transponders on the INSAT-4B and GSAT-15 satellite covering India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and parts of Afghanistan, China, and Myanmar. In India, the channels are marketed as DD Direct Plus/ DD Free Dish by Doordarshan, India's national broadcaster and other Indian private broadcaster ABS Free Dish from the ABS2 satellite, one can receive free-to-air regional TV channels using small DTH antenna and freetoair set-top box.\n\nUp until 2012, Israel had several free-to-air channels, the major ones rating-wise: Channel 2, Channel 10, and Channel 1. The other ones were Channel 23, Channel 33, and Channel 99.\n\nEuropean countries have a tradition of most television services being free to air. Germany, in particular, receives in excess of 100 digital satellite TV channels free to air. Approximately half of the television channels on SES Astra's 19.2° east and 28.2° east satellite positions, and Eutelsat's Hot Bird (13° east) are free-to-air.\n\nA number of European channels which one might expect to be broadcast free-to-air - including many countries' national terrestrial broadcasters - do not do so \"via satellite\" for copyright reasons. (Rights to purchase programs for free-to-air broadcast, especially via satellite, are often higher in price than for encrypted broadcast.) However, these channels usually provide a scheme to offer free, but encrypted, viewing with free-to-view broadcasts. Certain programming on Italy's RAI, and the majority of Dutch channels are covered by such schemes (although in the case of RAI some programming is transmitted without encryption where there are no copyright issues). In Austria, the main national networks broadcast free-to-view via satellite; however, all regional and some smaller channels are transmitted free-to-air, and the national public broadcaster, ORF, offers a special free-to-air channel which airs selected programming without (i.e. those without copyright issues) via satellite all over Europe.\n\nAs Germany and Austria speak the same language and use the same satellite, Austrian viewers are able to receive about 120 free German-speaking channels from both countries.\n\nIn general, all satellite radio in Europe is free to air, but the more conventional broadcast systems in use mean that SiriusXM style in-car reception is not possible.\n\nCable and satellite distribution allow many more channels to carry sports, movies and specialist channels which are not broadcast as FTA. The viewing figures for these channels are generally much lower than the FTA channels.\n\nVarious European countries broadcast a large number of channels via free-to-air terrestrial, generally as an analog PAL/SECAM transmission, digital DVB-T/T2 or a combination of the two.\n\nIn France, there are twenty six national television channels (MPEG-4 HD video) and 41 local television channels broadcast free-to-air via the TNT DVB-T service.\n\nIn Germany there are various free-to-air DVB-T services available, the number of which varies by region. Das Erste, ZDF, ZDFneo, ZDFinfo, 3sat, Arte, KiKA and Phoenix are available throughout the country, in addition to at least one region-dependent channel which is provided by the regional ARD member. Additionally, ARD's EinsFestival, EinsPlus and tagesschau24 are variously available in some parts of the country, and various commercial channels are available in metropolitan areas.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, there are nine television channels and 11 radio channels broadcast free-to-air via the DVB-T Saorview service. Analog PAL versions of some of the channels were also broadcast until October 24, 2012, when all analogue television broadcasting was shut down.\n\nIn the Netherlands, 3 national public television channels NPO 1, NPO 2 and NPO 3, and 7 national public radio channels broadcast free-to-air via the DVB-T Digitenne service. The television and radio channels of the regional public broadcasters are also free-to-air via the DVB-T service.\n\nIn the UK, around 220 free-to-air television channels and 25 free-to-air radio channels are available terrestrially via the Freeview DVB-T service. Seven HD channels are also broadcast via a public service broadcast multiplex and a commercial multiplex, both DVB-T2.\n\nIn Denmark, nine channels are as of 2018 free-to-air, distributed via 18 main transmitter sites and 30 smaller, auxiliary transmitters. The nine channels (DR1, DR2, DR3, DR Ultra, DR Ramasjang, DR K, Folketinget, TV2 Regionerne, and sign language/local programme) come in two DVB-T2 MUXes.\n\n\n"}

It is usually conducted through a variety of media or through sponsorship deals, particularly with sporting events or people.\n\nAlthough not as highly regulated as tobacco advertising and alcohol advertising, in many countries there are strict laws about the way in which such services can be marketed.\n\nGaming operators often sponsor sporting events, sportspeople or television coverage. For example, Bet365 sponsor snooker players and the Channel 4 coverage of The 2005 Ashes was sponsored by Betfair, both being online betting sites. In other instances, they will do stunts to get public attention. For example, many professional boxers have been sponsored by GoldenPalace.com, and sport temporary Golden Palace tattoos on their bodies. \n\nTo get around advertising restrictions, some online poker companies advertise free-play sites, like PartyPoker.net and PokerStars.net, and sometimes even call these free sites \"poker schools\". These sites restrict access to those of legal age, even though it is not required.\n\nIn Australia, the principle gaming agency TAB (Totalisator Agency Board) ran advertisements on TV during the 1990s, under the tagline \"The Adrenaline Bet\" (a play on the company's name). Since then, the TAB has been restricted from all advertising on television and other media, but is still allowed to print race dividends in the newspaper.\n\nFrom September 2007 the UK banned the advertising of around 1,000 gambling sites because they do not meet the guidelines dictated by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nChannel 4 Racing enjoyed a turnaround in its financial fortunes after UK law was changed to allow bookmakers to advertise directly on TV; it now contains bookmakers' adverts placed within the programme, shortly before each race.\n\nIn 2018, the BBC found links to gambling websites on the junior sections of the websites of several football clubs.\n\n"}

Billed as the oldest community circus in the world, it is one of only a handful of programs like it in the United States. The Great Y Circus started small and has grown tremendously throughout the years. The only years it was dark were from 1943-1948 (during the war) and in 1987-1988 (when the YMCA was without the insurance coverage required and continuation of the circus was in doubt).\n\nEach year, approximately 300 performers of all ages (from 20 months and up) learn circus skills in classes that are held at the YMCA from September through April.

L. James. It is the fourth installment in the \"Fifty Shades\" series, which had its start as fanfiction.\n\nThe novel was released on 18 June 2015 to coincide with the birth date of the character Christian Grey. The work's first printing run consisted of 1.25 million copies.\n\nChristian Grey, a successful and rich 27-year-old businessman, meets 21-year-old university student Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele when she interviews him on behalf of her friend/roommate Katherine \"Kate\" Kavanagh (being sick with the flu at the time) for the university newspaper. The characters develop an attraction for each other and Christian proposes a sadomasochistic relationship with Ana.\n\nChristian hopes that his relationship with Ana will relieve the effects of a traumatic childhood, but his dark sexual proclivities and self-loathing drive Ana away. Ana is initially naive about Christian's sadism and the power dynamics in their relationship but as the novel progresses she comes to understand that his behaviour is cold and controlling.\n\nOn 1 June 2015 James announced that she was in the process of writing another book in the \"Fifty Shades\" series due to popular demand from her fanbase. Later that same day she posted an image on her Instagram account that confirmed that the novel would be titled \"Grey\", that it would be told from the perspective of Christian Grey, and that she had deliberately chosen its publication date in order to coincide with Grey's birthday. Pre-order sales for \"Grey\" have been extremely strong, which led many retailers to order large quantities of the book in order to meet release day demand. An editor for \"The Bookseller\" also commented that \"Grey\" could become the \"biggest book of the year\".\n\nOn 11 June 2015 Random House reported that a finished copy of \"Grey\" had been stolen and that the theft was being investigated by Kent police. The theft, which occurred on 8 June, has been compared to the 2008 leak of Stephenie Meyer's \"Midnight Sun\", an unreleased companion novel that retells the events of \"Twilight\" from the perspective of Edward Cullen. Whereas the leak of \"Midnight Sun\" caused Meyer to put the work on indefinite hold, James stated that \"Grey\" would be released as scheduled.\n\nCritical reception for \"Grey\" has been generally negative and many critics have criticized it for being too similar to \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". The \"Daily Mail's\" reviewer commented that \"Ms James has simply shadowed the whole plot of Book One, reproducing the clunky polystyrene dialogue word for word, and inserting italicised thoughts by Christian himself.\" \"The Independent\" criticized the book and the choice to include Grey's internal monologues, stating that he had a \"vacuous mental life\" and that \"The effect is increasingly comical – Mills & Boon meets \"Peep Show\" – while the rest of his internal monologue is spent stating the bleeding obvious.\" \"The Telegraph\" wrote a scathing review where they called it \"as sexy as a misery memoir and as arousing as the diary of a sex offender\" and wrote \"It’s hard to work out what Ms Steele sees in him – even if you try to imagine him as Jamie Dornan, it’s Jamie Dornan as the serial killer in \"The Fall.\" \"The Guardian\" remarked on the book, stating that while the first book was \"a rather fun and fairly mild portrait of a woman’s sexual fantasy\", that \"Instead of lighthearted and repetitive mild S&M, the \"love affair\" is now the twisted work of an utter psychopath.\" In the US, \"The Washington Post\" also found little of the original series in the rewrite: \"Where Ana had bizarre quirks, a perplexing \"inner goddess\" who was an Olympic-caliber backflipper, and a general sense of naive wonder that lightened \"Fifty Shades\" and reminded readers not to take the story too seriously, there is none of that here. \"Grey\" is dark and unrelenting and far too serious, like Mr. Grey.\" \n\nFan reception for \"Grey\" has been positive and the book sold over 1 million copies in its first week of release.\n\n"}

The basic concept behind a house of mirrors is to be a maze-like puzzle. In addition to the maze, participants are also given mirrors as obstacles, and glass panes to parts of the maze they cannot yet get to. Sometimes the mirrors may be distorted because of different curves, convex, or concave in the glass to give the participants unusual and confusing reflections of themselves, some humorous and others frightening.\n\nThe first known literary example is in Gaston Leroux's novel \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1911), in which Erik has built one for the Shah of Persia as a trap and later uses a similar trap to protect his lair from his enemies. Perhaps the first cinematic instance of this was at the climax of the film \"The Lady from Shanghai\" (1948). Other notable examples include Woody Allen's movie \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\" (1993) which directly refers to \"The Lady from Shanghai\"; the CBS soap \"Guiding Light\" which, in 1980, featured a now famous sequence that depicted heroine Rita Bauer (Lenore Kasdorf) being pursued through a hall of mirrors by villain Roger Thorpe (Michael Zaslow); the show \"Macgyver\", where Jack Dalton is brainwashed and is forced to fire on Macgyver; and \"the Teen Titans series\" episode \"Betrayal\". Francisco Scaramanga's \"Fun House\" in the James Bond film \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" has a House of mirrors. In an episode of the Twilight Zone, \"In Praise of Pip\", a bookie tries to tell his dying son how much he loves him while chasing him inside a house of mirrors; the 1984 movie Conan the Destroyer with Arnold Schwarzenegger contains a house of mirrors fight, and the 1983 Walt Disney movie \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" (an adaptation of Ray Bradbury's novel of the same title) culminates in a house of mirrors confrontation. In the fourth season of the show Leverage, in the episode \"The Carnival Job\", Elliot has a showdown with Molly's captors in a house of mirrors.\n\nThe concept has also been used in comics. In \"\", Batman is seen chasing the Joker through an amusement park and into a hall of mirrors. It was used to create suspense as Joker could not clearly decipher what was real and what was just an image.\n\nIn Charlie Chaplin's 1928 movie The Circus, Charlie Chaplin is chased into a mirror maze by a thief and the police. Charlie Chaplin Official Youtube Movie Clip: Charlie Chaplin - The Mirror Maze (The Circus)\n\nIn John Boorman's 1974 movie \"Zardoz\", character \"Z\" (Sean Connery) battles against \"The Vortex\" in a mirror maze.\n\nOne of the most famous ending sequences in film history related to a house of mirrors is in \"Enter the Dragon\" starring Bruce Lee. The finale takes place in a house of mirrors, where Lee learns it is best to smash the glass obstacles to solve his problem and defeat the villain.\n\n\"\" (2017) - John Wick (Keanu Reeves) engages in a chase, gunfight, and climactic knife fight in a multi-floor modern art museum exhibit called \"Reflections of the Soul\" made of halls, rooms, and stairways lined with mirrors with lights and video screens reflected in them.\n\nThe Kraftwerk album \"Trans-Europe Express\" includes a song called \"The Hall of Mirrors\". Fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth also has a song called \"House of Mirrors\" of his \"Hard Hat Area\" album. The Insane Clown Posse album \"The Ringmaster\" has a song called \"House of Mirrors\", representing it as one of the attractions of the Dark Carnival.\n\nThe origins of the house of mirrors stem from the hall of mirrors in the Palace of Versailles.\n\nUpon a visit to France to discuss colonial land agreements, Peter Stuyvesant arrived at the Palace of Versailles and gazed upon the hall of mirrors present in the palace. Peter (or Petris) became determined to bring this amazement to the newly founded colonial city of New Amsterdam, of which he was governor. Peter Stuyvesant's House of Mirrors was founded in 1651 and he charged one Dutch gulden for admission.\n\n"}

Based in Paris, it offers courses balanced between artistic research, professional development and technical training.\n\nIn 2012, The Hollywood Reporter rated La fémis no.6 in its best international film school rankings (it included U.S.-based film schools) and no.3 in its 2014 best international film school rankings (it excluded U.S.-based film schools). Its alumni have won three of the world's most prestigious film prizes - Cannes Film Festival's Golden Palm, Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion and Berlin International Film Festival's Golden Bear - ten times, making it the most rewarded film school in the world, preceding the Beijing Film Academy and the Tisch School of the Arts of New York City, in winning those three prizes.\n\nFrom 1944 to 1985, the IDHEC (Institut des hautes études cinématographiques) was the main French film school — training 1,439 French and foreign film professionals.\n\nIn 1985, the school was restructured under the supervision of the then Minister of Culture Jack Lang and La Fémis was created in 1986. Originally, scriptwriter Jean-Claude Carrière was its president and Jack Gajos was its director.\n\nWhen La Fémis was created, the school had seven teaching departments: direction, screenwriting, picture, sound, editing, production, and set design. A script continuity course was added in 1992 and a distribution/exploitation course in 2003. Lastly the master-class workshop, a European production training program, was co-created with the Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg, Ludwigsburg, Germany in 2002. La Fémis is a full member of CILECT, the international network of film schools.\n\nThe school is now a public establishment under the responsibility of the Ministry of culture and communication. The school first opened in the Palais de Tokyo (Paris 16e), moving on February 15, 1999 to the old \"Rapid Film\" - Pathé Studios at 6, rue Francoeur (18e). Their founder and French prime class producer Bernard Natan was deported by the Nazis 1942.\n\nThe main curriculum students follow a four-year training course. During the first year, they all follow the same general course: initiation into the various jobs involved in filmmaking, experimenting in every technical position within a film crew.\n\nDuring the second and third year, they follow a specific curriculum depending on the department they have chosen, including theoretical classes, exercises, days devoted to film analysis, analytical seminars and collective exercises making films. They spend their fourth year fulfilling an individual end-of-studies project (known as \"travail de fin d'études\" or TFE) and taking part in their classmates' projects.\n\nIn sum, the school is designed to foster an applied cinephilia, in which the study of films past and present underwrites advanced skills in the practicalities of filmmaking; returning alumni, like Jean Paul Civeyrac, who come back to themselves lead seminars, carry on this tradition of encouraging advanced auteurist ambitions among the new students.\n\nThe school is the subject of a 2016 French film called \"Le Concours (The Graduation)\", directed by Claire Simon about the exhaustive application process to be accepted as a student.\n\nLa Fémis has trained over 700 students in all filmmaking trades: directors, screenwriters, producers, editors, cameramen, sound engineers, decorators, script supervisors, distributors and exhibition managers/executives.\n\nAmong them: \n\"(in alphabetical order)\"\n\n\n"}

The \"uniques\" are a superhero team working as a covert operation unit. Main actors are Arnaldo André, Mariano Martínez and Griselda Siciliani, the two main supervillains are played by Favio Posca and Carlos Belloso.\n\nUnlike most productions by Pol-ka, \"Los únicos\" is not a telenovela featuring common people or a vengeance plot. Instead, it is a crime fiction comedy with metafictional elements. As such, it avoids the usual constrains of the plots of the aforementioned genres. The plot is influenced by the \"X-Men\" film series, \"Heroes\" and \"Sky High\".\n\nNicolás Cabré makes a spin-off of the \"Sin Código\" telenovela, playing again his former character of \"Axel Etcheverry\". In the new plot, the \"Nielsen Security\" group has gone bankrupt, and Axel blames his former teammate Gabriel Nielsen for it. Nielsen (which was played by Adrián Suar, creator of both series) has appeared a number of times, as well as other characters and references to the former telenovela.\n\nArnaldo André composed his character, an experimented leader managing a team, based over his own protective relations with relatives, and the ways TV producers try to motivate him to accept a work. He made a deliberate effort to avoid giving an authoritarian style to the character, to avoid comparisons with his former character at \"Valientes\".\n\nThe series has had cameos from notable Argentine actors, such as Esteban Prol, Eugenia Suárez, Carlos Baute and Anabela Ascar. Gonzalo Heredia, from the previous successful telenovela \"Malparida\", played himself in a casual scene, with a brief cameo of Juana Viale, also from that telenovela. Osvaldo Laport will play again his former character of \"Amador Heredia\" from \"Soy Gitano\". Miguel Ángel Rodríguez and Martín Bossi will play crime bosses, and Ana María Orozco will join the team. A fashion show will include the presence of Pía Slapka, acting as herself, and fashion designer Roberto Giordano.\n\nThe series had a successful rating, with nearly 20 points.\n\nThe \"Uniques\" are actually one of several covert operation units of skilled or superpowered people working at different countries. Alfredo Monterrey organized many of those units, and the series is about the creation and organization of the Argentine branch. His recruits are Diego Rouvier, Axel Etcheverry, María Soledad Marini, Rubén Hagi, Rosario Ahumada, Violeta Morano and Hugo Albarracín. María has superhuman strength, Axel has an unbreakable skeleton, Rubén Hagi has indestructible skin, and Violeta Morano is precognitive. Diego and Rosario have no superhuman powers: Diego is a skilled secret agent, and Rosario a former burglar with a taste for high-stake thefts. The team is opposed by the villains Livio Muzak and Ronco Milevich. Ronco is capable of electric manipulation.\n\n\n"}

A long-standing friend of former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, Lord Levy spent nine years as Tony Blair's special envoy to the Middle East, being replaced by Gordon Brown's appointee, Lord Williams of Baglan, from September 2007.\n\nBorn in Stoke Newington, North London, to devout Jewish immigrant parents of modest means, Levy was educated at Grocers, later known as Hackney Downs School.\n\nLevy qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1966 (ACA then FCA) and set up a very successful professional accountancy practice.\n\nThe practice attracted a great number of clients in the music and entertainment industry and Levy became a specialist in international copyright and licence.\n\nAmongst the clients were the Foundations, Vanity Fair, Roger Greenaway, Barry Mason and many other successful producers and artists.\n\nLevy founded Magnet Records with Peter Shelley in 1973. This became one of the most successful independent labels of its day and at one stage had 10% of the British singles market with four singles in the top ten.\n\nThe successful artists on the label included Adrian Baker, Alvin Stardust, Chris Rea, Bad Manners, Darts, Susan Cadogan, Silver Convention and Guys 'n' Dolls.\n\nLevy sold Magnet Records to Warner Brothers in 1988 for £10m.\n\nGuitarist Chris Rea said of Levy, \"He is extremely tough, one of the hardest bastards I have ever met, but I would leave my children with him rather than anyone else.\" The music producer Pete Waterman described him as \"the greatest salesman I have ever met. He would be able to sell sand to the Arabs.\"\n\nAfter Magnet was sold, Levy set up M&G Records with backing from Polygram. M&G Records was so named as it was the initials of Michael and his wife Gilda, and featured acts such as Zoe who had a top five hit with \"Sunshine on a Rainy Day\" and Pele who had success with \"Fair blows the wind for France\". Polygram were then bought out and the company was eventually sold to Bertelsmann (BMG) in 1997.\n\nLevy was involved in fundraising from his early life and from the late 1960s for many causes including Jewish and Israeli causes. For this he showed a special adeptness, raising, between 1988–1994, £60m for Jewish Care, an amalgam of several Jewish charitable organisations, of which he is now President. Simon Morris, Chief Executive of Jewish Care, said of Levy that, when it comes to fundraising, \"there's no one better in the country.\" Levy has been described as the number one fundraiser in the country.\n\nLevy first met Tony Blair at a dinner party in 1994, hosted by Israeli diplomat Gideon Meir, the two having a common friend in Eldred Tabachnik, a senior barrister (now a QC and a former president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews) at 11 King's Bench Walk, the chambers founded by Derry Irvine where Blair had trained in the early 1980s. They soon became close friends and tennis partners. Levy ran the Labour Leader's Office Fund to finance Blair's campaign before the 1997 general election and received substantial contributions from such figures as Alex Bernstein and Robert Gavron, both of whom were ennobled by Blair after he came to power. Levy himself was created a life peer on 23 September 1997 as Baron Levy, of Mill Hill in the London Borough of Barnet. Since making his maiden speech on 3 December 1997, Levy has not spoken in a debate at the House of Lords.\n\nHe has been described by \"The Jerusalem Post\" as \"undoubtedly the notional leader of British Jewry\". He was a founding member of the Jewish Leadership Council, the leadership of UK Jewish community. Levy has close ties with Israeli political leaders. His son, Daniel Levy, was active in Israeli political life, and has served as an assistant to the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and to Knesset member Yossi Beilin. His son Daniel is now based in the UK and is now President of the US Middle East Project and before that was Head of the Middle East Department of the European Council of Foreign Relations. Levy has praised Blair for his \"solid and committed support of the State of Israel\" and \"his commitment to the peace process\". Levy was associated with the Labour Friends of Israel.\n\nKnown as \"Lord Cashpoint\" to some in the media and politics, he was the leading fundraiser for the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007 (having raised over £100m for the Labour Party. In 2007 he voluntarily decided to step down at the same time as former Prime Minister Tony Blair. \n\nIn 2000, Levy was criticised when it was revealed that he had paid only £5,000 tax during the financial year 1998–1999 – however it was subsequently shown even in that year the tax paid was £30,000. In an interview at the time, repeated on BBC2's Newsnight on 16 March 2006, Levy stated that \"Over the years I have paid many millions of tax and, if you average it, each year it comes to many hundreds of thousands of pounds. In that particular year, I was giving my time to the Labour Party and the voluntary sector, and I just lived off capital.\"\n\nFrom 1998 until 2007, he acted as Prime Minister Blair's personal envoy to the Middle East.\n\nMany leaders in the region including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have praised Levy for always offering constructive suggestions. Mr Blair has said Lord Levy carried out \"a perfectly excellent job as my envoy under very difficult circumstances\".\n\nIn September 2005, Levy was appointed President of the Council of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, the body overseeing the government's Specialist schools and Academy programmes.\n\nLevy was arrested and questioned in connection with the \"Cash for Honours\" inquiry by the Metropolitan Police on 12 July 2006 (whereby it was suggested that money was paid to political parties for Honours in particular peerages). No charges were made against Levy and the police removed all details from their files.\n\nLevy is President of Jewish Care, the Jewish Free School, Volunteering Matters, Jewish Lads' and Girls' Brigade and Barnet & Southgate College. and the Honorary President of UJIA.\n\nHe is a Member of the World Board of Directors, The International Peace Institute, IPI (2014- ). He is a Member of the Advisory Council, Step Up to Serve Campaign (2013- ). He is the Chair of the Policy Network Foundation, a policy think tank.

He and his wife Gilda were restrained with handcuffs and had bleach poured over them. Levy was hit on the head with a shovel and had his wrist broken; the attackers fled with £80,000 of cash and jewellery.\n\nLord Levy received an Honorary Doctorate from Middlesex University in 1999, and the Israel Policy Forum (USA) Special Recognition Award in 2003. In 1994 he was a Recipient of the B'nai B'rith First Lodge Award and in 1998 a Recipient of the Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Scopus Award.

Upon its launch, it replaced the Southeast Asian feed of Nickelodeon in the Philippines, which used to be distributed in the country since its launch in 1996.\n\nIn October 11, 2006, Viacom's subsidiary MTV Networks Asia Pacific set up a new unit to manage Nickelodeon's southeast Asia operations. On April 1, 2011, MTV Networks launched a dedicated Filipino Nickelodeon channel.\n\nIn October 1996, Nickelodeon decided to reach the popular channel to the Philippines, Japan and Russia as an attempt to bring the popular channel to Asia. One of their shorts were Right Here, Right Now (based on the 1993 Nick USA shorts) and their ID's were by FRONT. In 2003, it became a part of Nicksplat (Nickelodeon's headquarters in Asia).\n\nOn October 11, 2006, Viacom's subsidiary MTV Networks Asia Pacific set up a new unit to manage Nickelodeon (Southeast Asia) TV based in Singapore. Nickelodeon was launched in Singapore and expanded its services in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Polynesia. Nickelodeon Philippines, Nickelodeon Pakistan, and Nickelodeon India started working independently. They started their new website in 2003.\n\nOn March 15, 2010, Nickelodeon revamped their logo same as the United States and worldwide and started broadcasting newer Nickelodeon shows from the United States that represents the new Nickelodeon logo and airs latest episodes of current Nick shows.\n\nOn April 1, 2011, the Nickelodeon Asia feed was replaced with a dedicated Filipino Nickelodeon channel, although it will still use the Nick-Asia branding used in other countries. On April 11, 2011, the lineup was changed prior to Nickelodeon Southeast Asia. The new schedule will put live-action programs in the primetime slot and will double the Nick Jr. block.\n\nNickelodeon celebrated the release of the new channel on April 9, 2011 on the Bonifacio Global City, Open Field, Taguig City with the event entitled, \"Nick World\". The event included mascots of notable Nicktoons characters with storytelling, an animals show, martial arts performances and a world of exciting attractions, booths, and modules for kids.\n\nStarting on May 23, 2011, the lineup of Nickelodeon will once again change where they will cease airing the Nick Jr. block in the afternoon timeslot and will be replaced by live-action shows and miscellaneous NickToons programs. This lineup will double the TeenNick block which only runs in the evening and other animated shows that only airs once a day.\n\nIn 2012, Nickelodeon uses new graphics used in the US and UK, however it only applies to selected programs' promos and station IDs. The former Nick-Asia graphics is still used.\n\nIn 2015, Nickelodeon Philippines introduced Hapon Hangout, A Nickelodeon hour special that starts at 4:00pm to 6:30pm every weekdays.\n\nOn July 17, 2017, the channel was rebranded into the US version. It was made by Superestudio, an Argentina branding agency.\n\nThe Philippines Kids Choice Awards is the second setting of the Kids Choice Awards in Asia preceded by Indonesia. The show was first held since 2008 at the Aliw Theater in Pasay and was first hosted by Michael V. and some various Filipino artists. Nickelodeon, an American cable television network, brought Kids' Choice Awards to the Philippines in an effort to strengthen its presence in Asia. According to Amit Jain, executive Vice-President and managing director of MTV Networks India, China and Southeast Asia, \"This is a milestone for Nickelodeon's business in Southeast Asia as it will deliver on Nick's commitment\nof providing global kids-centric shows and properties which are adapted to reflect local tastes and aspirations.\" The Philippines KCA has been inactive all over the years.\n\nPrior to the launch of Nickelodeon Philippines in the fall of 1998, Nickelodeon first aired in the country as a block of the free-to-air State-owned TV channel PTV until 1992. The block used to air in the mornings and afternoons mostly educational, drama-related programmes and game shows. Then, it moved to New Vision 9 until 1998, and again from 2003 to 2006 as RPN. During that time, GMA Network purchased the rights to air \"Rugrats\" and selected Nick Jr. shows from 1998 to 2006.\n\nRPN lost its broadcasting rights of airing Nickelodeon shows to ABC in 2006. Nick shows were later dubbed for the first time to Filipino on August 11, 2008 (with the exception of \"Go, Diego, Go!\"), making it the first national network to do so. Later rebranded as TV5, the channel ended its contract with Nickelodeon on June 30, 2010, months after it was purchased by PLDT's MediaQuest Holdings from the Cojuangco group and Malaysia-based broadcaster Media Prima Berhad which caused a major reshuffle in the TV5's programming. \"Yo Gabba Gabba!\", also a Nickelodeon production, was the only Nick program retained by TV5 after losing its rights to ABS-CBN. Although produced by Nickelodeon, it wasn't dubbed to Filipino as the contract have been already expired.\n\n\"SpongeBob SquarePants\" was also aired on Q (now GMA News TV) weekday mornings until February 18, 2011 when the network was discontinued. It wasn't dubbed in Filipino either.\n\nABS-CBN launched \"Nick Time\" (later Nickelodeon on ABS-CBN) on July 26, 2010 at under their \"Team Animazing\" timeblock. Nickelodeon shows such as \"Dora the Explorer\", \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", \"The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron\", and \"\" among others are shown during Nick Time, thus continuing the Filipino dub that was started by TV5. However, ABS-CBN's airing of Nickelodeon's shows was criticized for having majority of episodes edited due to time constraints, heavy advertising gaps and ABS-CBN's importance to local programming. \"Dora the Explorer\" ended on June 24, 2011 while \"The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron\", \"Avatar: The Legend of Aang\" and \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" ended last October 8, 2011 and replaced by \"Go, Diego, Go!\", \"The Penguins of Madagascar\" and \"\" on October 15, 2011. After a week, \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" goes back to air.\n\nStudio 23, ABS-CBN's former affiliate, launched \"Nickelodeon on Studio 23\" on October 4, 2010. Like its mother station ABS-CBN, programs are dubbed in Tagalog. As of now, there are no plans to air shows such as \"iCarly\" on either network, despite its popularity. Studio 23 launched \"Catscratch\" that premiered last August 2011. The Nickelodeon on Studio 23 block temporarily ended in October 2011 and returned in January 2012.\n\nAfter 3 years, Nickelodeon on Studio 23 ended airing its block on January 16, 2014 to pave way for Channel 23's relaunch as ABS-CBN Sports+Action (currently known as S+A), a sports-oriented channel. To allow smooth transition of the new channel, Nickelodeon on ABS-CBN Sports+Action was launched last January 20, 2014 and all of its shows are reverted to its original English language rather than Filipino-dubbed. Since the launch of ABS-CBN's digital black box ABS-CBN TV Plus in 2015, it is no longer seen on ABS-CBN Sports+Action. Currently, the network's digital channel \"Yey!\" carries all Nickelodeon & Nick Jr. shows (under the \"Nickelodeon sa Yey!\" banner) in Filipino-dubbed audio, with notable exception of shows like \"Peppa Pig\". The said block paved way the introduction of \"The Fairly OddParents\" (currently the second longest active Nick cartoon show after \"SpongeBob SquarePants\") to free television in summer of 2018. Some shows are still being aired on the main channel on weekends.\n\nNickelodeon airs new programs and episodes of current Nick shows every 2–7 months after the US broadcast but sometimes takes a year. The program lineup is different from the Nick-Asia feed where live-action programs are aired twice in the afternoon and evening and the Nick Jr. block runs longer. Along with the announcement of the dedicated feed, there were several shows announced to be premiering on Nickelodeon this year such as \"Bubble Guppies\", \"House of Anubis\", \"The Fresh Beat Band\", \"\" and \"T.U.F.F. Puppy\". Original Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. titles still remains in the channel. The Loud House's Chinese dub available in Malaysia and Singapore via SAP (Second Audio).\n\nProgramming in Nickelodeon Philippines also in Southeast Asia has often been segmented into blocks.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26744396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26744396", "title": "Play (theatre)", "text": "Play (theatre)\n\nA play is a form of literature written by a playwright, usually consisting of dialogue and singing between characters, intended for theatrical performance rather than just reading. Plays are performed at a variety of levels, from Broadway, Off-Broadway, regional theater, to Community theatre, as well as university or school productions. There are rare dramatists, notably George Bernard Shaw, who have had little preference as to whether their plays were performed or read. The term \"play\" can refer to both the written texts of playwrights and to their complete theatrical performance.\n\nComedies are plays which are designed to be humorous. Comedies are often filled with witty remarks, unusual characters, and strange circumstances. Certain comedies are geared toward different age groups. Comedies were one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece, along with tragedies. An example of a comedy would be William Shakespeare's play \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", or for a more modern example the skits from \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nA generally nonsensical genre of play, farces are often acted and often involve humor. An example of a farce includes William Shakespeare's play \"The Comedy of Errors\", or Mark Twain's play \"Is He Dead?\".\n\nA satire play takes a comic look at current events people while at the same time attempting to make a political or social statement, for example pointing out corruption. An example of a satire would be Nikolai Gogol's \"The Government Inspector\" and Aristophanes' \"Lysistrata\". Satire plays are generally one of the most popular forms of comedy, and often considered to be their own genre entirely.\n\nRestoration comedy is a genre that explored relationships between men and women, and was considered risqué in its time. Characters featured in restoration comedy included stereotypes of all kinds, and these same stereotypes were found in most plays of this genre, so much so that most plays were very similar in message and content. However, since restoration comedy dealt with unspoken aspects of relationships, it created a type of connection between audience and performance that was more informal and private.\n\nIt is commonly agreed that restoration comedy has origins in Molière’s theories of comedy, but differs in intention and tone. The inconsistency between restoration comedy’s morals and the morals of the era is something that often arises during the study of this genre. This may give clues as to why, despite its original success, restoration comedy did not last long in the seventeenth century. However, in recent years, it has become a topic of interest for theatre theorists, who have been looking into theatre styles that have their own conventions of performance.\n\nThese plays contain darker themes such as death and disaster. Often the protagonist of the play has a tragic flaw, a trait which leads to their downfall. Tragic plays convey all emotions and have very dramatic conflicts. Tragedy was one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece. Some examples of tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", and also John Webster's play \"The Duchess of Malfi\".\n\nThese plays focus on actual historical events. They can be tragedies or comedies, but are often neither of these. History as a separate genre was popularized by William Shakespeare. Examples of historical plays include Friedrich Schiller's \"Demetrius\" and William Shakespeare's \"King John\".\n\nBallad opera, a popular theatre style at the time, was the first style of musical to be performed in the American colonies. The first musical of American origin was premiered in Philadelphia in 1767, and was called “The Disappointment”, however, this play never made it to production. Around the 1920s, theatre styles were beginning to be defined more clearly. For musical theatre, this meant that composers gained the right to create every song in the play, and these new plays were held to more specific conventions, such as thirty-two-bar songs. When the Great Depression came, many people left Broadway for Hollywood, and the atmosphere of Broadway musicals changed significantly. A similar situation occurred during the 1960s, when composers were scarce and musicals lacked vibrancy and entertainment value.\n\nBy the 1990s, there were very few original Broadway musicals, as many were recreations of movies or novels.\nMusical productions have songs to help explain the story and move the ideas of the play along. They are usually accompanied by dancing. Musicals can be very elaborate in settings and actor performances. Examples of musical productions include \"Wicked\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof\".\n\nThis theatre style originated in the 1940s when Antonin Artaud hypothesized about the effects of expressing through the body as opposed to “by socially conditioned thought.” In 1946, he wrote a preface to his works in which he explained how he came to write what and the way he did.\n\nAbove all, Artaud did not trust language as a means of communication. Plays within the genre of theatre of cruelty are abstract in convention and content. Artaud wanted his plays to have an effect and accomplish something. His intention was to symbolise the subconscious through bodily performances, as he did not believe language could be effective. Artaud considered his plays to be an enactment rather than a re-enactment, which meant he believed his actors were in reality, rather than re-enacting reality.\n\nHis plays dealt with heavy issues such as patients in psych wards, and Nazi Germany. Through these performances, he wanted to “make the causes of suffering audible”, however, audiences originally reacted poorly, as they were so taken aback by what they saw. Much of his work was banned in France at the time.\n\nArtaud did not believe that conventional theatre of the time would allow the audience to have a cathartic experience and help heal the wounds of World War II. For this reason, he moved towards radio-based theatre, in which the audience could use their imagination to connect the words they were hearing to their body. This made his work much more personal and individualized, which he believed would increase the effectiveness of portraying suffering.\n\nTheatre of the Absurd: This genre generally includes metaphysical representations of existential qualms and questions. Theatre of the absurd denies rationality, and embraces the inevitability of falling into the abyss of the human condition. Instead of discussing these issues, however, theatre of the absurd is a demonstration of them. This leaves the audience to discuss and question the content of the play for themselves.\n\nOne of the main aspects of theatre of the absurd is the physical contradiction to language. Oftentimes, the dialogue between characters will directly oppose their actions.\n\nFamous playwrights within this genre include Beckett, Sartre, Ionesco, Adamov, and Genet.\n\nThe term \"play\" can be either a general term, or more specifically refer to a non-musical play. Sometimes the term \"straight play\" is used in contrast to \"musical\", which refers to a play based on music, dance, and songs sung by the play's characters. For a short play, the term \"playlet\" is sometimes used.\n\n"}

Sooklek regained his mouth with the ouster of Thanom in 1973.\n\nAn animation series in both 2D and 3D has been produced with Sooklek in the starring role. A commemorative book has also been launched by the Prayoon Foundation. The book is divided into two sections with the first focusing on Sooklek and the second about Prayoon's life and works.\n\nTo commemorate Prayoon's centenary, the Thailand Post launched a sheet of stamps.

The premise of the sketch is that the joke is so funny that anyone who reads or hears it promptly dies from laughter.\n\nThe sketch appeared in the first episode of the television show \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" (\"Whither Canada\"), first shown on 5 October 1969. \n\nThe German translation of the joke in the sketch is made of various meaningless, German-sounding nonce words, and so it does not have an English translation.\n\nThe sketch is framed in a documentary style and opens with Ernest Scribbler (Michael Palin), a British \"writer of jokes\", creating the funniest joke in the world only to die laughing. His mother (Eric Idle) finds the joke, reads it and also immediately dies laughing. A brave Scotland Yard inspector (Graham Chapman) attempts to retrieve the joke, with the playing of very sombre music on gramophone records and the chanting of laments by fellow policemen to create a depressing mood. The inspector leaves the flat with the joke but also dies from laughter.\n\nThe British Army wish to determine \"the military potential of the Killer Joke\". They test the joke on a rifleman (Terry Jones), who snickers and falls dead on the range. They then translate it into German, with each translator working on only one word of the joke for their own safety (one translator saw two words of the joke and had to be hospitalised). The German \"translation\" (in reality mostly just nonsense words) is used for the first time on 8 July 1944 in the Ardennes, causing German soldiers to fall down dead from laughter:\nThe German version is described as being \"over 80,000 times as powerful as Britain's great pre-war joke\" (at this point a newsreel of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain waving his \"Peace of paper\" appears on screen). The joke is then used in open warfare, with Tommies running through an open field amid artillery fire shouting the joke at the Germans, who die laughing in response. Afterward, a German field hospital is shown with uncontrollably laughing German soldiers in bandages, presumably having heard some parts of the joke. \n\nIn a subsequent scene, a British officer from the Joke Brigade (Palin) has been taken prisoner and is being interrogated by Gestapo officers. The British officer uses the joke to escape as his German captors die laughing, with one German officer (Cleese) insisting the joke isn't funny before finally cracking up and then uttering a Woody Woodpecker-style laugh before expiring.\n\nThe Germans attempt counter-jokes. For example, film is shown of Adolf Hitler supposedly saying \"My dog has no nose\", then a German soldier asking \"How does he smell?\", with Hitler replying \"Awful!\" Eventually their best \"V-joke\" (in reference to the V-1 flying bomb) is attempted on a radio broadcast: \"Der ver zwei peanuts, valking down der strasse, und von vas assaulted...peanut. Ohohohoho!\" Although the joke is followed triumphantly by the German anthem \"Deutschland über alles\", the attack is ineffective.\n\nThe British joke is said to have been laid to rest when \"Peace broke out\" at the end of the war, and countries agree to a Joke Warfare ban at the Geneva Convention. In 1950, the last copy of the joke is sealed under a monument in the Berkshire countryside, bearing the inscription \"To the Unknown Joke\". Thus, the English version of the joke is never revealed to the audience.\n\nThe footage of Adolf Hitler is taken from Leni Riefenstahl's film \"Triumph of the Will\". The section (about 34 minutes into the film) where Konstantin Hierl presents the Reich Labor Corps to Hitler is the source of the speech used for the joke. The first clip shows Hitler saying ' (\"In particular, no one will live in Germany anymore [without working for their country]\"), subtitled \"My dog has no nose\". In the film, the camera cuts briefly away from Hitler; the punchline of the joke is the next shot that shows Hitler's face: \"Awful\". The original words are ', from \"[The whole nation will go through] your school\". \"How does he smell?\" is from a scene just before Hitler's speech; the original German is \"\", \"We are the Reich's young men!\"\n\nRobert W. Chambers's 1895 short story collection \"The King in Yellow\" has a recurring motif of a play (named \"The King in Yellow\") which causes all who read it to go mad.\n\nMark Twain's story \"A Literary Nightmare\" (also published as \"Punch, Brothers, Punch!\") tells of a jingle so catchy that, upon hearing it, the listener cannot stop repeating it until it is passed on to someone else.\nLord Dunsany's 1916 story \"The Three Infernal Jokes\", published in the collection \"Tales of Wonder\", concerns jokes that kill those who hear them.\n\nThe 1943 war-time story \"Nothing But Gingerbread Left\", by science fiction writer Henry Kuttner, has a very close premise. Rather than a joke, a marching song (in German) is used as a weapon against the German soldiers. Engineered by American linguists, it is by design such a catchy song that the soldiers cannot stop singing it, and eventually they can think of nothing else. At the climax, Adolf Hitler is ready to deliver a critically important speech, but begins chanting the marching song.\n\nA story that ran for several weeks in the Sunday comics of \"Li'l Abner\" during 1967 concerned the creation of a joke, never actually revealed, that was so funny that anyone who heard it immediately died laughing. For safety reasons, government agents somehow decided to keep the joke hidden in the protective custody of Abner Yokum. Meanwhile, comedian Bob Hope learns of the existence of this \"Funniest Joke in the World\", but not about its deadly effects, and decides that he wants to recite it on his next television show. He procures the joke from Abner, and the government agents learn of this development too late to prevent him from reading it on national television. It turns out, however, that before Bob Hope obtained the joke from him, Abner had read the joke, not understood it, and substituted his own favourite joke. It is this joke that Bob Hope reads on the air, to no harmful effect whatsoever.\n\nThe sketch was later remade in a shorter version for the film \"And Now for Something Completely Different\". It is also available on the CD-ROM video game version of the film \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\".\n\nIf the German version of the joke is entered into Google Translate, instead of an English translation the program returns “[FATAL ERROR]”.\n\n\n"}

It has a long tradition in various countries and is commonly associated with the circus. Other skills similar to tightrope walking include slack rope walking and slacklining.\n\nAcrobats maintain their balance by positioning their centre of mass directly over their base of support, i.e. shifting most of their weight over their legs, arms or whatever part of their body they are using to hold them up. When they are on the ground with their feet side by side, the base of support is wide in the lateral direction but narrow in the sagittal (back-to-front) direction. In the case of highwire-walkers, their feet are parallel with each other, one foot positioned in front of the other while on the wire. Therefore, a tightwire walker's sway is side to side, their lateral support having been drastically reduced. In both cases, whether side by side or parallel, the ankle is the pivot point.\n\nA wire-walker may use a pole for balance or may stretch out his arms perpendicular to his trunk in the manner of a pole. This technique provides several advantages. It distributes mass away from the pivot point, thereby increasing the moment of inertia. This reduces angular acceleration, so a greater torque is required to rotate the performer over the wire. The result is less tipping. In addition the performer can also correct sway by rotating the pole. This will create an equal and opposite torque on the body.\n\nTightwire-walkers typically perform in very thin and flexible, leather-soled slippers with a full length suede or leather sole to protect the feet from abrasions and bruises while still allowing the foot to curve around the wire. Though very infrequent in performance, amateur, hobbyist, or inexperienced funambulists will often walk barefoot so that the wire can be grasped between the big and second toe. This is more often done when using a rope, as the softer and silkier fibres are less taxing on the bare foot than the harder and more abrasive braided wire.\n\n\nThe word \"funambulism\" or the phrase \"walking a tightrope\" is also used in a metaphorical setting not referring to any actual acrobatic acts. For instance, politicians are said to \"walk a tightrope\" when trying to balance two opposing views with little room for compromise. The term can also be used in satirical or acidic contexts. Nicholas Taleb uses the phrase in his book \"The Black Swan\". \"You get respect for doing funambulism or spectator sports\". Taleb is criticising scientists who prefer popularism to vigorous research and those who walk a fixed and narrow path rather than explore a large field of empirical study.\n\n"}

Dutton.\n\nThe title character in narrative works is one who is named or referred to in the title, such as The Doctor in the TV series \"Doctor Who\", Harry Potter in the namesake series of novels and films, \"Romeo and Juliet\" in the Shakespeare play or Annie Oakley in the musical \"Annie Get Your Gun\".\n\nThe \"title character\" need not be fictional, such as Erin Brockovich in the film of the same name or Thomas More in the play \"A Man for All Seasons\" by Robert Bolt.\n\nThe title character need not be named in the title, but may be referred to by some other word or phrase, such as Bilbo Baggins in \"The Hobbit\" or Idi Amin in \"The Last King of Scotland\". A title character may only be indirectly \"described\" in the title, as in \"An Ideal Husband\" by Oscar Wilde, where the 'ideal husband' (the title role) is the apparently perfect Sir Robert Chiltern.\n\nThe title character need not be the subject of the whole title in a strict grammatical sense: Uncle Tom is the title character of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and Lee Marvin is often described as playing the title character in the film \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\", as his character (Liberty Valance) is named in the title, even though the subject of the title is the person who shot him.\n\nA title character may be the main antagonist, e.g. Sauron in \"The Lord of the Rings\" or Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\". In \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", the wizard is the title character, but Dorothy Gale is the main character. In the video game \"The Legend of Zelda\", the title character, Princess Zelda, is the damsel in distress, but the protagonist is Link. The title character may be unseen, e.g. Godot in \"Waiting for Godot\", Rebecca de Winter in the 1938 novel \"Rebecca\", or Jason Bourne in the 2012 film \"The Bourne Legacy\".\n\nTitle character has been attributed to objects, for example the bus in the film and musical \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\".\n\nThe general phrase \"title character\" can be replaced with a description of the character, which is then \"titular\". For example, the title character of \"Dracula\" can be referred to as \"the titular vampire\", and the title character of \"Hamlet\" is \"the titular prince of Denmark\".\n\n"}
