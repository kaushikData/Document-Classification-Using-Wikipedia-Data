Extinction Agenda is a 2.5D side-scrolling action platform available for Microsoft Windows. It was developed by a Thai independent developer Extend Studio.\n\nThe game takes place in a future setting where the Earth is contaminated by pollution. A group of scientist were trapped in Deep Space Reprocessing station after a mysterious asteroid emitting unknown fluorescent gas collided into the station. The survivors then discovered that machines in the station becomes violent towards them after being exposed to the gas. Eventually, they managed to send the sample of the gas to the research team back at the United Earth Headquarters to find out a way to rescue them and called the gas \"Zytron\". Player takes control of the game protagonist \"Ares\", the first Zytron immune robot created to battle machines that become malevolent from being exposed to the Zytron gas, in a mission to rescue the survivors from a deep space station.\n\nPlayers control Ares' movement with WASD keys on the keyboard and aim with mouse. Ares can double jump and roll to avoid attacks and obstacles and can change his suit during the course of the game which gives him a different aesthetic appearance and abilities. He can also activate Vakyl Cannon, a rechargeable orbital cannon which destroys all of the enemies on screen. Players can collect parts from destroyed enemies to craft items and upgrade weapons. They can also collect Datacubes which are scattered throughout the stages which not only unlock background information about certain characters and enemies, but also improve Ares' abilities such as lowering the number of parts required to craft items. Throughout the game players will be able to obtain new weapons in each stage. At the end of each stage, Ares will have to defeat bosses in order to progress. Players can go back between stages during the game by accessing the in-game menu.\n\nA.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda was originally called \"Trashman\", but the development team changed the name to appeal more to international audiences.\n\nThe game reception is mostly average. Critics from major publications praised A.R.E.S. for its soundtrack and detailed vibrant artwork while criticizing the length of the game to be too short. Due to its popularity, the soundtrack of the game was eventually released on Steam as a downloadable content on January 2, 2012. A.R.E.S. won second prize in 2010 Microsoft's Dream.Build.Play. contest along with other notable independent games such as Beat Hazard.\n"}

{"id": "4916835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4916835", "title": "Atari Karts", "text": "Atari Karts\n\nAtari Karts is a kart racing video game developed by Miracle Designs and published by Atari Corporation exclusively for the Atari Jaguar first in North America on December 15, and later in Europe on December 22 of the same year. It is one of the first titles developed by Miracle Designs and its gameplay is similar to the \"Mario Kart\" series, where items are placed at predetermined points in the tracks.\n\nIn \"Atari Karts\", players take control of one of the seven characters available including Bentley Bear, the protagonist of the arcade game Crystal Castles, with each one having different capabilities. In single player mode, players race against computer-controlled characters in multi-race cups over four levels of difficulty and during the races, speed boosting and other power-ups can be used to gain an advantage while in multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups. It features numerous homages to the history of Atari and its games.\n\n\"Atari Karts\" received mixed reception when it was released. While it received praise for its graphics, sound and controls, many were divided in regards to the gameplay and others criticized its lack of offensive power-ups during both single and multiplayer modes, and lack of variety. Critics also compared the game with \"Super Mario Kart\", which was released three years prior on the SNES. Although it never received a direct sequel, Miracle Designs would go on to develop multiple kart racing titles such as \"Merlin Racing\" for the Nuon and \"Rascal Racers\" for the PlayStation, which are considered spiritual successors to the game. Retrospective reviews for the title have been equally divisive in recent years.\n\n\"Atari Karts\" is a kart racing game, similar to \"Super Mario Kart\", featuring both a single-player and multiplayer modes. During gameplay, players take control of one of seven available characters at the beginning of the game and drive karts around tracks. Before starting to drive, a traffic light will appear and start the countdown. When the light turns green, the race begins. During a race, the player's viewpoint is from behind his or her kart. The goal of the game is to either finish a race ahead of other racers, who are controlled by the computer and other players. Unlike \"Super Mario Kart\", however, no battle and/or time trial modes are present. When starting the game, four levels of difficulty are available to choose from and they are comprised of three cups, though only one difficulty level is accessible at the start and by winning all of the three cups at the selected level of challenge, the \"Miracle Race\" challenge can be accessed. In the Miracle Race, either one or two players compete in a race against a boss character and when defeated, they become playable characters. By pressing Option at the main menu, players can access the options screen where a number of settings can be changed, such as controls and set the type of terrain display when racing, with hill (which gives tracks a roller coaster-like feel to them) being the default mode. When selecting a characters, another player can join at any given time on the character select screen. Progress and settings are automatically kept into the cartridge's internal EEPROM and the game also features support for the ProController.\n\nTiles marked with a specific mark are arrayed on the race tracks; these give special abilities (power-ups) to a player's kart if the vehicle passes over them. These power-ups can either benefit or harm those who have picked them up, ranging from a rabbit icon that give players a speed boost for a few seconds to a red icon that reverse the vehicle's controls for brief period of time as well. On two-player races, a green icon that reverse the opponent's controls is the only offensive power-up available on the game. As with \"Super Mario Kart\", each cup consists of five-lap races and each one takes place on a distinct track, with more being unlocked on higher difficulties but in order to continue through a cup, a fourth or higher position must be achieved in each race. If a player finishes in fifth to eighth position, they are \"ranked out\" and the race must be replayed at the cost of one of a limited number of lives until a placing of fourth or above is earned. If the player has no lives when they rank out, the game is over, though players can pick up a heart icon (extra life) that are placed on a fixed spot on the track.\n\nThe game makes numerous homages to Atari's history and its games. Bentley Bear, the main player character of \"Crystal Castles\", is a playable character and has a track based on his game as well. The Borregas Cup is a reference to the company's old address: 1196 Borregas Avenue, Sunnyvale, California. The Tempest Cup's name is a tribute to Dave Theurer's arcade game \"Tempest\". The Miracle Race is named after Miracle Designs, the game's developer.\n\n\"Atari Karts\" initially features seven playable characters, while four more playable characters can be unlocked by completing the \"Mirace Race\" challenges on each difficulty level for a total of 11 playable characters to choose from:\n\nAccording to ex-Atari Corporation vice-president in third-party development Bill Rehbock, programmers Filip Hautekeete and Peter Vermeulen at Miracle Designs received an Alpine development kit for the Atari Jaguar from Atari Corp. themselves and started working on with it. Both Filip and Peter created a demo showcasing an emulated interpretation of the Mode 7 graphics mode found in the Super Nintendo to test the capabilities of the Jaguar and sent it to Bill and ex-Atari employee J. Patton. Impressed with the results seen from the demo, Atari decided to create a game by combining both \"F-Zero\" and \"Super Mario Kart\", with Bill suggesting the usage of Bentley Bear from \"Crystal Castles\" along with other characters from Atari, which did not make it into the final release and designing the game with a \"cutesy\" atmosphere for the family audience. This demo became the starting point for the development of \"Atari Karts\". \n\n\"Atari Karts\" makes extensive use of the Mode 7 technique developed by Miracle Designs for the system, featuring elevated and lowered terrains when racing on the tracks. The soundtrack was composed in by Fabrice Gillet in ProTracker on an Amiga. Neither he nor the people who created the in-game artwork are listed in the game's credits at the end of the game, with the manual just referring to them as the \"Miracle Designs Team\". \"Atari Karts\" was developed in Belgium and was formally announced in early 1995 under the working title \"Kart\". It was also previewed in a supplementary July 1995 issue by \"Edge\" magazine under a new working title; \"Super Karts\", which lead to the confusion that Virgin Interactive's similarly named \"SuperKarts\" was being converted to the Jaguar. In both internal documents from Atari and a list of upcoming games for the system by \"VideoGames\" magazine, listed the title of the project under its final name minus the letter S and as a September 1995 title. Development on the game was completed on December 11 1995, a few days before release. The game was showcased during the Fun 'n' Games Day event hosted by Atari.\n\n\"Atari Karts\" received mostly mixed reviews. The two sports reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave it scores of 5.5 and 5 out of 10, particularly criticizing the dull track design. One of them elaborated that \"Although the scenery changes, each race is an exercise in repetition: pick up icons, don't hit anything.\" They did, however, compliment the smoothness of the controls. \n\n\"GamePro\" commented that the game was well-made but too simplistic and cutesy to appeal to anyone but young children, concluding, \"These races present just the right level of cuteness and challenge for those younger Jaguar gamers. The question, of course, is how many seven-year-olds are out there looking for Jag games?\". \n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" agreed that \"Atari Karts\" was chiefly geared to a younger audience and lacks sophistication, and further criticized that the various tracks are visually different but handle and feel the same. However, he said the game \"does have a certain charm that makes it hard to avoid.\" \n\nReviewers for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", \"GamePro\", and \"Next Generation\" all accused the game of being an obvious knockoff of \"Super Mario Kart\".\n\n\"JustClaws\" website gave the game their maximum rating of 5 out of 5 stars.\n\nIn a retrospective review for \"The Atari Times\", Gregory D. George criticized the lack of interesting power-ups and the limited enemy AI, which results in perfect drivers as the player's competition.\n\nAfter \"Atari Karts\" was released to the market, Miracle Designs started working on a sequel to the game but never moved forward beyond the planning phase.\n\n\"Merlin Racing\", an racing title developed by the same team and released for the Nuon, is considered a spiritual successor to the game.\n\n"}

{"id": "44798902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44798902", "title": "Captain Marvel (M. F. Enterprises)", "text": "Captain Marvel (M. F. Enterprises)\n\nCaptain Marvel was a superhero published by Myron Fass' short-lived M. F. Enterprises. The character is unrelated to those published by Fawcett Comics, DC Comics, or Marvel Comics and only appeared in a few comics in the late 1960s before legal challenges shut down the publisher.\n\n\"Captain Marvel\" lasted for four issues (cover-dated April–Nov. 1966). It was followed by two issues of \"Captain Marvel Presents the Terrible Five\", numbered #1 and #5 (Sept. 1966 and Sept. 1967).\n\nCaptain Marvel was a jet-booted and laser-eyed alien android powered by an \"M\"-emblemed medallion who had been sent to Earth by his creators to escape the atomic destruction of their war-ravaged planet. \n\nVowing to protect the peace of his new home, the self-proclaimed \"Human Robot\" took the secret identity of journalist turned Dartmoor University professor Roger Winkle in the city of Riverview, USA where he lived with his young ward Billy Baxton, the first person he met when he arrived on Earth and the only one who knew his true origins. \n\nCaptain Marvel possessed superhuman strength and speed and the ability to fly thanks to his jet-heeled Astro-Boots that enabled him to hurl through sky and space at fantastic speeds. \n\nHis super-durable robotic body was equipped with advanced alien technology that, among other things, allowed him to generate force fields and sonic blasts and to shoot metal-melting laser beams out of his eyes. He also had a super-intelligent computer brain programmed with the scientific knowledge of two worlds that could alter his internal mechanisms to do anything from breath underwater to travel through time. \n\nCaptain Marvel's signature ability, however, was the power to detach his head, limbs and hands and send them flying off in all directions whenever he shouted \"Split!\" and reattach them when he shouted \"Xam!\"\n\nDespite these impressive talents, he was by no means invulnerable. \n\nHe had to remember to rub his energy-giving amulet once every twenty-four hours in order to recharge his circuitry or else he would start to lose important functions like memory and mobility. \n\nGlass barriers and electronic interference could prevent him from reassembling himself, and his metallic structure meant he could be attracted and held by large powerful magnets. What's more his synthetic body parts were made of materials not available on Earth and could not be replaced if lost or destroyed.\n\n\"Captain Marvel\"'s villains included characters who resembled other companies' characters, or whose names were actually already in use by other companies, such as the super-stretchable alien master of disguise Plastic Man (Plastic Man), who was renamed Elasticman after his first appearance, and the bristly-mustached mad scientist Dr. Fate (Doctor Fate), who was torn between a desire for revenge and his obsession with learning the electronic secrets of the android he called a \"human thingamajig\". \n\nThe flying, hypnotic mastermind known as the Bat resembled Batman enough to prompt a response from DC Comics attorneys threatening to sue for plagiarism. The character's name was changed to the Ray (not to be confused with the Quality Comics character) along with the addition of a lightning bolt emblem on his chest.\n\nOther characters were only somewhat less legally contentious. The handsome Prof. Doom of the subversive organization B.I.R.D. (Bureau of International Revolutionary Devices) secretly performed on-campus mind control experiments which endangered Prof. Winkle's relationship with the university president's daughter Linda Knowles. Colonel Cold was a bioterrorist who secretly hid capsules containing a deadly virus in ballpoint pens and distributed them throughout the city. Tarzac, the bald and green-gilled self-styled \"King of the Sharks\", rode a giant seahorse and protected an underwater fortress. Nuclear physicist turned metal-mouthed pirate Atom-Jaw could bite through solid steel. \n\nAnd then there was Tinyman, a miniature human being who, in an inversion of Ant-Man and the Atom's powers, could grow to normal adult male size and quickly shrink back down again. Working as circus sideshow freak when not engaged in illegal activities, the white-haired, blue and black-clad Tinyman eventually tired of his sordid lifestyle and reformed with the hero's help, taking the name Jack Baker and going back to school to get his law degree, eventually becoming the local district attorney.\n\nCaptain Marvel's true nemesis, the only foe he actually \"hated\" (because he was pre-programmed to by his makers), was the burly, flame-throwing Destroyer, an android like himself, a literally fiery-eyed, skullcap-clad weapon of mass destruction created by the enemy Volcano People of the hero's home planet who also escaped the death of their world and was now allied with Earth's own hostile subterranean race.\n\nThe M. F. Enterprises version of Captain Marvel made a cameo appearance, along with other alternate versions of Captain Marvel, in issue #27 of DC Comics' \"The Power of Shazam!\" (1997). The character is shown performing his trademark division trick while wearing the traditional thunderbolt costume of Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel.\n\nA strikingly similar superhero was Mort Todd and Daniel Clowes's the Divisible Man whose bizarrely dark and humorous stories appeared in issues of \"Lloyd Llewellyn\" and \"Anything Goes!\" back in the eighties and was, according to Todd, created as an attempt to do something as \"nuttily visual\" as Jack Cole's original Plastic Man.\n\n"}
{"id": "383282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=383282", "title": "Character actor", "text": "Character actor\n\nA character actor or character actress is a supporting actor who plays unusual, interesting, or eccentric characters. The term, often contrasted with that of leading actor, is somewhat abstract and open to interpretation. In a literal sense, all actors can be considered character actors since they all play \"characters\", but in the usual sense it is an actor who plays a distinctive and important supporting role.\n\nA character actor may play characters who are very different from the actor's off-screen real-life personality, while in another sense a character actor may be one who specializes in minor roles. In either case, character actor roles are more substantial than bit parts or non-speaking extras.\n\nThe term is used primarily to describe television and film actors, and is less used to describe theater actors. An early use of the term was in the 1883 edition of \"The Stage\", which defined a character actor as \"one who portrays individualities and eccentricities\". Actors with a long career history of playing character roles may be difficult for audiences to recognize as being the same actor.\n\nUnlike leading actors, they are generally seen as less glamorous. While a leading actor often has physical beauty needed to play the love interest, a character actor may be short or tall, heavy or thin, balding, older, or simply unconventional-looking and distinctive in some physical way. For example, the face of Chicago character actor William Schutz was disfigured in a car accident when he was five years old, but his appearance despite reconstructive surgery helped him to be memorable and distinctive to theater audiences. Generally, the names of character actors are not featured prominently in movie and television advertising on the marquee, since a character actor's name is not expected to attract film audiences. The roles that character actors play in film or television are often identified by only one name, such as \"Officer Fred\", while roles of leading actors often have a full name, such as \"Captain Jack Sparrow\". Some character actors have distinctive voices or accents, or they develop memorable mannerisms. A character actor with a long career may not have a well-known name, yet may be instantly recognizable.\n\nDuring the course of an acting career, an actor can sometimes shift between leading roles and secondary roles. Some leading actors, as they get older, find that access to leading roles is limited by their increasing age. In the past, actors of color, who were often barred from roles for which they were otherwise suited, found work performing ethnic stereotypes. Sometimes character actors have developed careers based on specific talents needed in genre films, such as dancing, horsemanship, acrobatics, swimming ability, or boxing. Many up-and-coming actors find themselves typecast in character roles due to an early success with a particular part or in a certain genre, such that the actor becomes so strongly identified with a particular type of role that casting directors steer the actor to similar roles. Some character actors play essentially the same character over and over, as with Andy Devine's humorous but resourceful sidekick, while other actors, such as Sir Laurence Olivier, have the capacity of submerging themselves in any role they play. That being said, some character actors can be known as \"chameleons\", actors who can play roles that vary wildly. One such example of this is Gary Oldman. Some character actors develop a cult following with a particular audience, such as with the fans of \"Star Trek\" or \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\".\n\nCharacter actors tend to play the same type of role throughout their careers, including Harvey Keitel as a \"tough and determined guy\", Dame Maggie Smith as an \"upstanding lady matriarch\", Christopher Lloyd as an eccentric, Claude Rains as a \"sophisticated, sometimes ambiguously moral man\", Abe Vigoda as a \"leathery, sunken-eyed\" and tired hoodlum on the verge of retirement, Christopher Walken as a \"speech maker\", Vincent Schiavelli as \"the confused guy\", Fairuza Balk as a \"moody goth girl\", Steve Buscemi as \"a quirky, smart guy with a mind just outside of reality\" and Forest Whitaker as a \"calm, composed character with an edge and potential to explode\". Ed Lauter usually portrayed a menacing figure because of his \"long, angular face\" which was easily recognized in public, although audiences rarely knew his name. Character actors can play a variety of types, such as the femme fatale, gunslinger, sidekick, town drunk, villain, whore with a heart of gold, and many others. A character actor's roles are often perceived as being substantially different from their perceived real-life persona, meaning that they do not portray an extension of themselves, but rather a character substantially different from their off-screen persona. Character actors subsume themselves into the characters they portray, such that their off-screen acting persona is practically unrecognizable. According to one view, great character actors are rarely out of work, and often have long careers that span decades. They are also often highly regarded by fellow actors.\n\n\n"}

The term was coined by the American motion picture trade magazine \"Variety\" following the explosion of films in the genre released in 1973 in the U.S. after the success of \"Five Fingers of Death\". The word is a play on chop suey, combining \"chop\" (as in karate chop referring to a strike with the edge of the hand) and \"sock\" (as in a punch).\n\nChopsocky movies are usually characterized by over-blown story-lines, cheesy special effects (particularly exaggerated and sometimes bizarre sound effects during the actual fight scenes), and excessive violence. The genre also is known for its clumsy dubbing. Although the term \"chopsocky\" is commonly used as a name of martial arts cinema by the general media, the word can be disparaging as well. Another common meaning is a generalization for martial arts movies from Asia or Hong Kong in particular without necessarily having the negative connotation. \"Variety\" magazine, the originator of the term, defined \"chopsocky\" simply as a martial arts film with no negative connotations.\n\n"}

In television broadcasting, the term denotes the absence of both audio and video program material. Technically, a carrier wave may be still be being transmitted; in radio, the result is silence, and in television, the result is a silent black image. \n\nAlthough television directors may use the command \"fade to black\" or \"to black\" to indicate a momentary transition to a completely black image, the term \"dead air\" is most often used in cases where program material comes to an unexpected halt, either through operator error or technical malfunction. Among professional broadcasters, dead air is considered one of the worst things that can occur. Moreover, dead air could affect advertising revenue if it affects the airplay of paid commercials.\n\nThe term \"dead air\" does not refer to a broadcast transmitter that is intentionally shut down, i.e. \"closed\", \"signed off\" or \"off the air\", by a control operator.\n\nIn the US, dead air, if prolonged and occurring without permission, is an actionable offense that can result in fines from the FCC.\n\nBroadcast stations can use programmable devices known as \"silence sensors\", \"off air alarms\" or \"silence monitors\" that will sound an alarm and alert personnel if dead air persists more than a few seconds.\n\nOn September 11, 1987, Dan Rather walked off the set of the CBS Evening News when a late running U.S. Open tennis match threatened to delay the start of his news broadcast. The match then ended sooner than expected but Rather was gone. The network broadcast six minutes of dead air before Rather was found and returned to the studio. CBS affiliates criticized Rather for the incident.\n\nOne significant case of dead air occurred during Super Bowl LII in 2018, when the NBC television broadcast experienced 26 seconds of dead air during a commercial break. The network blamed \"a brief equipment failure\", and stated that no commercial advertising was lost. Prior to Super Bowl XLV, Green Bay radio station WCHK-FM announced that it would intentionally go to dead air during the game, since the hometown Packers were playing in the game.\n\nWhen British Virgin Radio host Chris Evans did not arrive for work on time resulting in Vanessa Feltz filling in for 30 minutes until Evans took the microphone, \"The Guardian\" characterized it as a promotional stunt that forced Feltz \"to fill the dead air with jokes\".\n\n"}

{"id": "30102827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30102827", "title": "Eliza Doolittle", "text": "Eliza Doolittle\n\nEliza Doolittle is a fictional character from London who appears in the play \"Pygmalion\" (George Bernard Shaw, 1912) and the musical version of that play, \"My Fair Lady\".\n\nEliza is a Cockney flower girl, who comes to Professor Henry Higgins asking for elocution lessons, after a chance encounter at Covent Garden. Higgins goes along with it for the purposes of a wager: That he can turn her into the toast of elite London society. Her Cockney dialect includes words that are common among working class Londoners, such as ain't; \"I ain't done nothing wrong by speaking to the gentleman\" said Doolittle.\n\nDoolittle receives voice coaching and learns the rules of etiquette. The outcome of these attentions varies between the original play and the various adaptations (see \"Pygmalion\" article).\n\nThe part of Eliza was originally played by Mrs Patrick Campbell, at that time the most famous actress on London's West End stage. Shaw had written the role for her, and although many considered her too old for the role she triumphed. The unprecedented use of the word \"bloody\" - as a scripted intensive - caused a sensation when Campbell delivered it.\n\nFor the 1938 film \"Pygmalion\", George Bernard Shaw personally requested the young English actress Wendy Hiller play Doolittle, a part she had previously played on stage opposite Leslie Howard as Higgins. Her performance served as the definitive film portrayal until Audrey Hepburn played the role in the highly successful 1964 film musical \"My Fair Lady\".\n\nJulie Andrews originated the musical version of Doolittle on stage in \"My Fair Lady\", with Rex Harrison as Higgins. Sally Ann Howes took the role of Eliza Doolittle in 1958 when Julie Andrews left. Harrison went on to reprise his role in the 1964 film alongside Audrey Hepburn as Doolittle. At the 37th Academy Awards, the award for Best Actress went to Andrews for her performance as Mary Poppins. Hepburn was not nominated. Despite this, many critics greatly applauded Hepburn's \"exquisite\" performance. \"The happiest thing about [\"My Fair Lady\"]\", wrote Bosley Crowther, \"is that Audrey Hepburn superbly justifies the decision of Jack Warner to get her to play the title role.\" Her co-star Rex Harrison, also called Hepburn his favourite leading lady and Gene Ringgold of \"Soundstage\" also commented that \"Audrey Hepburn is magnificent. She is Eliza for the ages,\" while adding, \"Everyone agreed that if Julie Andrews was not to be in the film, Audrey Hepburn was the perfect choice.\"\n\nMartine McCutcheon played the role in the 2001 London revival of \"My Fair Lady\". Despite missing many performances (citing health problems), having to have various understudies perform the role and withdrawing nearly five months early from the production's transfer to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, she won the award for best actress in a musical at the 2002 Laurence Olivier Awards. One of the understudies was then-unknown \"First Lady of the West End\" Kerry Ellis.\n\nLauren Ambrose is currently playing the role in the 2018 Lincoln Center Theater revival of \"My Fair Lady\" on Broadway, a performance for which she was nominated for the 2018 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical and won the 2018 Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical. Kirsten Anderson has been Ambrose's alternate, performing the role once a week. Laura Benanti will replace Ambrose in October 2018 to perform the role through February 2019.\n\nA song from \"My Fair Lady\", titled \"Just You Wait\", sung by Eliza, includes this passage:\n\n\"One day I’ll be famous! I’ll be proper and prim;\" <br>\n\"Go to St. James so often I will call it St. Jim!\"<br>\n\"One evening the king will say:\" <br>\n\"‘Oh, Liza, old thing,\" <br>\n\"I want all of England your praises to sing.\"<br>\n\"Next week on the twentieth of May\" <br>\n\"I proclaim ‘Liza Doolittle Day!\" \n\nFans of \"My Fair Lady\" have ever after been fond of making an informal observance of Eliza Doolittle Day each May twentieth.\n\n"}
{"id": "9475751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9475751", "title": "Erfworld", "text": "Erfworld\n\nErfworld is a story-driven fantasy/comedy webcomic about a master strategy gamer summoned into and stuck inside a wargame. The first book, The Battle for Gobwin Knob was written by Rob Balder and illustrated by Jamie Noguchi. Erfworld was recognized as one of the top 10 graphic novels of 2007 by Time Magazine. The second book, Love is a Battlefield was illustrated by Xin Ye. Before his departure, David Hahn was the artist for much of the third book, Hamsterdance versus the Charlie Foxtrot, which will be completed by Xin Ye with colors and inks by Lauri Ahonen and Lillian Chen. A portion of the webcomic series has been animated, Ken-Burns-style, with voice-over work by Arthur Chu.\n\n\"Erfworld\" follows a graphic novel format, with a new page added with each update. The setting is \"Erfworld\", a fantasy world that adheres to the rules of a fictional turn-based strategy wargame. The narrative focuses on a complex story about warring factions within this world, but most installments also contain humor, puns, and side-gags about strategy-fantasy video games, role-playing games, and references to history or popular culture. The webcomic's distinctive visual style counters the theme of unending violence with a twee, kawaii artistic sensibility (described by the creators as \"cute\") in which characters are drawn to look like dolls, or anime characters, or toys. Injuries draw no blood in Erfworld, and damage is cured overnight. That same charming aesthetic follows in its lisping use of letter changes in frequently used names, particularly replacing \"r\" with \"w\" (spidews, dwagons, and twolls instead of spiders, dragons, and trolls). The comic was originally started as an attempt to bring all of author Rob Balder's fantasy-related strips from his other comic, PartiallyClips, into the same universe and tell a story with them.\n\n\"Erfworld's\" plot, setting, and characters are released under a Creative Commons Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike license.\n\nWebcomics authors such as Howard Tayler of \"Schlock Mercenary\" and Mohammad \"Hawk\" Haque of \"Applegeeks\" have posted reviews and comments about \"Erfworld\", and it has been cited on the webcomic site \"Fleen\", by authors outside the webcomic field such as Time-Blog and \"Time\" author/journalist Lev Grossman in his articles \"Webcomics are the New Blogs\" and \"Erfworld: It's a Boopin' Good Webcomic!\" Grossman also listed Erfworld as one of the Top 10 Graphic Novels of 2007. The addition of \"Erfworld\" to GiantITP was noted in \"First Watch,\" \"Dragon Magazine's\" monthly section on new developments in gaming and entertainment. Additionally, Erfworld was reviewed by Webcomic Overlook, receiving four stars out of five, and was profiled by NPR.\n\nFollowing on the success of the \"Order of the Stick\" Kickstarter project, in February 2012, author Rob Balder launched the Erfworld \"Year of the Dwagon\" Kickstarter, seeking funding for a motion comic project. The Kickstarter was extremely successful, resulting in funding of almost $85,000, making it the fourth-largest comics category Kickstarter project as of May 2012.\n\n\"Erfworld's\" premise is that overlord Stanley the Plaid is conducting a military campaign to quest for the Arkentools - artifacts of ancient power left behind by the Titans who created the Erfworld. Stanley controls one of these tools, the Arkenhammer, but his quest for the others seems to have been costly and unsuccessful; the story opens as his final living warlord is killed in battle. Stanley's chief adviser, Wanda Firebaugh, convinces him to purchase a \"Summon Perfect Warlord\" spell as a final attempt to prevent defeat. The spell summons Earth gamer Parson Gotti (whose name is an anagram for \"Protagonist\") into Erfworld, where he is to serve as chief warlord under Stanley.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Ansom of Jetstone is leading a massive coalition toward Stanley's capital, Gobwin Knob, hoping to destroy Stanley's side forever. Ansom's coalition has many members, but most prominent in the story are Jetstone (Ansom's kingdom), the forces of Transylvito (a vampire-like people) and Archons (hovering female fighters) he has hired from Charlie, a powerful overlord and mercenary.\n\nEarly in the comic, one of Ansom's officers, Jillian Zamussels, flies on a scouting mission, but is captured by Stanley's forces and taken to Gobwin Knob. Wanda interrogates Jillian and, having gained magical or emotional control of her, releases her to become an unwitting double agent. During this time, Parson has been learning the battle mechanics of Erfworld and has planned an attack on Ansom's coalition. He sends a force of dwagons to make hit-and-run raids on the coalition's siege units, then draws Ansom into various traps as the coalition pursues the wounded dwagons. Jillian eventually locates the dwagons but is unwilling to attack because she is under Wanda's mind-control spell. Wanda's spell ultimately fails, however, and Jillian leads an attack that destroys the dwagons. Stanley is enraged about Parson and Wanda's unsuccessful plans and decides to take his last stand back into his own hands. He takes the surviving dwagons, then departs his capital to start his side afresh on the uninhabited site of another capital he sacked some years ago. Stanley's departure is a major turning point in the story, as these events leave Parson in sole command of the limited forces remaining at Gobwin Knob, which he must rally in a final stand against Ansom's much larger coalition.\n\nParson quickly puts some defensive plans into action. Parson contacts Charlie, and asks him to switch sides; Charlie declines but agrees to sit the fight out. Also, as Ansom's forces scout the mining tunnels under Gobwin Knob to find weak points, Parson orders Sizemore, Stanley's dirtamancer, to ignore all but the scouts closest to the city, but to strike those with overwhelming force. This ploy tricks Ansom into thinking he has found an unguarded route to the main city garrison.\n\nMeanwhile, Ansom has dispatched a force of air units, led by Jillian, to hunt down Stanley. They eventually rendezvous with forces from Transylvito (but without Charlie's promised Archons) and head Stanley off at a narrow pass. When Stanley and his flight of dwagons arrive at this choke point, an intense fight ensues, leaving him with heavy losses. Stanley escapes under a veil cast by his foolamancer and heads back toward Gobwin knob.\n\nWhile Stanley is still away, the final battle for Gobwin Knob begins in earnest. Ansom first sends a large force of Jetstone units into the tunnels beneath the city, which are all destroyed by hidden traps and forces. Wanda animates the fallen enemies into an army of uncroaked soldiers, which Parson uses to protect the outer walls of Gobwin Knob. Ansom fails to breach the well-protected outer walls until he re-enlists Charlie's help at a high cost. Once the wall is breached, Ansom pours his units into the city and does a \"Dance Dance Revolution\"-style dance led by Charlie's Archons, which gives his forces a massive bonus and leads them to victory.\n\nParson does not admit defeat though, and uses a perfidious false surrender offer as a ruse to assassinate Ansom. Parson's twoll lackey Bogroll tackles Ansom from the parapet and both fall to their deaths. Parson then collapses his own city, killing most coalition forces within the walls, but even this leaves too many enemy units alive. Parson retreats with the casters into the isolated portal room to plan the desperate final attack that will be the story's climax. Gobwin Knob is built atop an extinct volcano, so Parson orders the casters to make it erupt. The casters use magic to link the minds of Wanda the Croakamancer and Sizemore the Dirtmancer, so that with their combined skill they can uncroak the volcano.\n\nParson and the casters flee though a portal to escape the resulting eruption, and return to find a ruin. The coalition is erased and the terrain itself changed. Sizemore shows Parson that he has discovered a fortune in gemstones exposed by the volcano, while Wanda finds the Arkenpliers (Ansom's former arkentool) and attunes to them. With the power of the Arkenpliers, Wanda is able to permanently reanimate dead units to their original strength. She uses them to \"decrypt\" the late Prince Ansom and most of the other fallen coalition forces as powerful new allies.\n\nThe first book concludes as Parson (also known as Lord Hamster) asks Maggie, Gobwin Knob's thinkamancer, to what extent his actions are his own doing, and to what extent they were forced by magical loyalty. She tells Parson he is himself mostly responsible for the death and desolation around him. Parson appears to be both disgusted with the actions he had to take, and also empowered by learning that he has control over his own destiny. He walks away and speaks angrily to the \"Erfworld\". He ends his monologue by shouting \"I won't be a gamepiece. I'm a Player. Fuck You!!\", apparently breaking the Erfworld's \"censorship\", and throws his sword into the lava, where it melts.\n\nIn the aftermath of this battle, Gobwin Knob is rebuilt. Wanda and Ansom lead the decrypted army on a campaign to conquer the world and convert all to the belief that attunement to the Arkentools, not royal origin, is the true source of divinely ordained rule. Book Two begins as this army confronts the forces of Jetstone, after the off-screen destruction of their ally Unaroyal. The decrypted Ansom attempts to persuade his still-living brothers to accept Toolism. They refuse, and a battle breaks out in which Ansom's brother Ossomer is captured. Ansom then makes another attempt to persuade him, only to watch Wanda order Ossomer cut down so she can decrypt him. The army then marches on Jetstone's capital city with intent to take the city, which according to the rules of Erfworld ends the side and causes the remaining cities to become \"neutral.\" Wanda and Parson agree that they almost certainly have the forces to win, but then Charlie uses the Arkendish (which he controls) to intervene in the battle by ending Stanley's turn.\n\nAlso known as Lord Hamster, Parson serves as Chief Warlord or warlord of the side Gobwin Knob throughout the story, and as its protagonist, whisked away from Earth to Erfworld at the beginning of the first book. His name is an anagram of \"Protagonist\".\n\nPrior to the story, Parson is depicted as having been the author of the webcomic Hamstard (actually created by the authors of Erfworld as a meta-background for Parson's character and as an \"easter egg\"). He spent months at a time designing strategy games for his own amusement as an escape from an unsatisfying job and life.\n\nParson questions whether Erfworld is real or just a coma dream of his, if his actions truly are his own (the summoning is supposed to put him under Stanley's command) and the ethics of his situation (his actions makes him responsible for thousands of deaths and he is serving what appears to be the evil side). Still, he chooses to tentatively accept the reality of the situation and the role he has been given. Parson is large by Erfworld standards (and fat by real-world standards), standing roughly twice as tall as Wanda Firebaugh. He does not conform to all the rules of the universe (for example, he doesn't have visible \"stats\" like the in-world characters). Janice has said that he is a Hippiemancer; whether this is true or not is unknown.\n\nOverlord of the side \"Gobwin Knob\" and of the nearly lost Plaid tribe. Stanley serves as the superior of the protagonist throughout the story so far, with whom he is initially at odds.\n\nOriginally known as Stanley the Plaid, he started off as a piker unit under King Saline IV and eventually rose to the position of warlord. During his service, he came to possess the Arkenhammer, a mysterious tool of divine origin, setting himself apart as a warlord, and later, ruler. King Saline IV later paid to have Stanley promoted to Heir Designate. Thus, when King Saline IV was killed in an attack while Stanley was away, Stanley and his side were not dissolved and retook the city.\n\nAt the time of the story, Lord Stanley is involved in an ongoing war in an effort to find the other Arkentools, believing it is the will of the Titans he control them. At the beginning of the first book, this war has reduced his realm from eleven cities to only Gobwin Knob itself. He had Wanda summon \"the perfect warlord\" in an attempt to win the battle for Gobwin Knob, which yielded Parson Gotti. In Stanley's first meeting with Parson, Parson convinced him that \"tool\" was a term of honor. Drawing a connection between this title and his search for the Arkentools, Stanley declared that he should henceforth be addressed as \"Tool\". Stanley objects strongly to being called a \"bad guy,\" and considers himself to be divinely favored by the Titans. Stanley's underlings often suffer from his unchecked ego and limited patience, as well as his limited intelligence. His name (and newly assumed title) is a play on Stanley Tools.\n\nChief Croakamancer serving Lord Stanley, and a member of the lost Croatan tribe. Wanda is the second named character to appear in the first book. Her name is a play on \"wand of fireball.\"\n\nShe is a patient and skilled manager, though she is ruthless in battle and not above using seduction as a means of manipulating others. She is skilled at many types of magic, but has stated that only Croakamancy (which she uses to animate fighters \"croaked\" in battle as \"uncroaked\") holds any interest for her. She has demonstrated some ability with Hat Magic, Dollamancy, and Thinkamancy (which are all Fate magics). By the end of book one, she controls the Arkenpliers, an Arkentool that allows her to perform feats of croakamancy that are normally impossible, such as raising corpses to create lifelike intelligent \"decrypted\" units.\n\nDuring the first book, Prince Ansom serves as Chief Warlord to King Slately of the Jetstone and the leader of the Royal Crown Coalition fighting against Stanley, and the primary antagonist. His name is a play on \"handsome\" (cf. Prince Charming), while his initial outfit resembled the costume worn by Evel Knievel.\n\nHe was a skilled leader, warrior, and tactician but lacked modesty and was prone to reckless behavior when his pride was at stake. His crest was a radish. He carried the Arkenpliers, though he was not attuned to them, and thus could not use their full abilities. He had a history of personally riding to Jillian's rescue, and Wanda believes he was in love with her. While he apparently looked down on those not of royal or noble houses—Vinny correctly guessed that he despised Stanley not so much for his attacks on other peoples as for the fact he came to rule by regicide—he did, according to Jillian, honestly believe in the concept of noblesse oblige, and as a result often put himself in unnecessary danger to protect his troops.\n\nHe was croaked by Bogroll and decrypted (improved uncroaking) by Wanda at the end of the first book, and serves Gobwin Knob as Chief Warlord at the start of the second, prior to his capture.\n\nA female barbarian and warlord, fighting for the army of Prince Ansom. She has been known to engage in combat even when directed to avoid it. She has an unrealistically oversized sword. Her personal relationship with Prince Ansom is initially unclear but evolves into a romance; she declined Ansom's invitation to join him in his tent, but later that night approached it, stopped, and walked away. Later, she professes her love for Ansom after breaking Wanda's spell, and it is implied that they sleep together when she spends a night on his flying carpet. She chats casually with Wanda after being tortured and interrogated by her, but later suddenly breaks down and collapses. It is revealed that Wanda is able to influence her feelings and thoughts. She has stated that she was originally the heir of the kingdom of Faq, an isolated and peaceful Utopian kingdom visually modeled after Japanese feudal society, and the daughter of King Banhammer, a philosopher-king who disliked his heir for her violent and aggressive ways. Her name is an approximation of \"jillions of muscles.\" During the intermission between books 1 and 2, she restores Faq with herself as queen, with assistance from Transylvito.\n\nA Dirtamancer in the army of Gobwin Knob and one of the few remaining members of the Plaid Tribe. In the beginning of the first book, he helped Parson learn how magic works in Erfworld.\n\nHe is very curious and loves to study all types of magic, but is unskilled in any beyond his specialty, and knows little about military matters. When forced into combat as the battle reaches Gobwin Knob itself, he is very regretful about taking lives, but reluctantly accepts it as his duty to do so.\n\nA one-eyed twoll who served as a guardsman in Gobwin Knob and lackey to Parson. He was loyal and typically good-natured, although a frequent target of the other guardsmen's pranks. Bogroll was croaked by Coalition forces, having sacrificed himself in a kamikaze attack on Ansom, and cannot be decrypted due to the grievous harm inflicted on his body. Bogroll was a character in the PartiallyClips strip, and is the only crossover between PartiallyClips and Erfworld. His name is a British English colloquialism for toilet paper.\n\nA count of the Transylvito tribe who fights for the Royal Crown Coalition. Like other Transylvitans, Vinny has the appearance of a vampire, though sunlight apparently does not harm him. Vinny seems to be a close advisor and friend of Prince Ansom, to whom he has few qualms about speaking frankly. He has confronted Ansom with his opinion that Stanley's commoner origins, not his military aggressions against several coalition members, are at the root of Ansom's antipathy toward Stanley, while assuring Ansom that this issue would not affect his personal loyalty. As his name implies, he controls the coalition's bat scouting units. His name is a reference to Vinny Boombatz, a fictional character created by stand-up comedian Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nA Thinkamancer in the employ of Gobwin Knob. She is very skilled in her specialty and amoral in its application. She can send thinkagrams (telepathic messages) and link multiple casters together to combine their powers. She controlled a link with the Foolamancer Jack Snipe and the Lookamancer Misty, then later a link with the Croakamancer Wanda and the Dirtmancer Sizemore. When she broke the first link, she protected herself from the backlash at the expense of the other two. Parson planned to punish her by explicitly ordering her to break the second link and protect Wanda and Sizemore. She would probably have died from the backlash while doing so, but Parson decided against it at the last moment. She bears a passing physical resemblance to Margaret Thatcher.\n\nThe Overlord of Charlescomm. Charlie has consistently remained offscreen, interacting with other characters via remote communication. The character of Charlie, his archons, and his penchant for mystery are likely drawn from the titular character of the 1970s television series Charlie's Angels. However, his Eyebook handle, CharlsNChrg, refers to the 80s TV show, Charles in Charge.\n\nCharlie was first contracted by Prince Ansom during the first book to supply a group of Archons to reinforce the expedition sent to rescue Jillian Zamussels. Later, after Ansom broke off the alliance in the expectation that Charlie would make a new alliance with Transylvito, Charlie instead took advantage of his release from his contract to begin dealing with Parson. Charlie shows no real commitment to either side, but does value his reputation as a mercenary who \"stays bought\".\n\nPrince Ansom's brother and chief warlord of Jetstone after the Battle for Gobwin Knob. He was captured by Wanda and then killed and 'popped again'; executed and resurrected by the Arkenpliers. However, he appears to have broken the loyalty to the pliers and became a Jetsone unit again. His name is an approximation of \"awesomer\".\n\nFour Arkentools have appeared in the comic so far, but only three have been drawn.\n\nA hammer resembling a toy croquet mallet. Owned by and attuned to Stanley the Plaid/Tool, the Arkenhammer has the power to control dwagons, glow brightly, levitate itself and its wielder, generate multiple lightning bolts, \"rock out\" (play heavy rock music to the benefit of combat units) turn approximately 20 percent of walnuts cracked with it into pigeons and turn some bird-like units into walnuts. Stanley claims the Arkenhammer has chosen him for divine reasons, and uses this, and Wanda's beckoning, as rationale for his quest to obtain the other tools.\n\nA sword-sized pair of needle-nose pliers. Previously owned by but not attuned to Prince Ansom, they served as a close combat weapon and had the power in his hands to \"turn most Uncroaked to dust\". Stanley believed that Ansom's attack on Gobwin Knob was divinely directed to bring the Arkenpliers to him. Seen in the hands of the Unaroyal Warlord Lady Sylvia Lazarus of the Coalition immediately prior to a volcanic eruption, the Arkenpliers were recovered by Wanda from the aftermath of the explosion, and have attuned to her. They give Wanda the ability to \"decrypt\" corpses, restoring them to life (or at least a close approximation thereof) with nearly intact intellect, memories, and abilities - though their loyalty is to the Croakamancer that raised them rather than their previous side. Wanda can also decrypt units that normally can not be uncroaked. These abilities are unparalleled in the discipline of Croakamancy.\n\nAn object resembling a satellite dish. Owned by and attuned to Charlie, it gives him a mastery of Thinkamancy, allowing him to hack into Stanley's communications systems and communicate with Parson via his Eyebook. Parson uses the fact that Charlie is not a Royal but still attuned to it to further provoke Ansom. Parson later learns from Wanda's Decrypted Archons that the Arkendish grants Charlie many additional abilities, some of which are unknown even to them: he can handle an unlimited number of Thinkagrams, and extend some of his abilities to his personal guard of Archons. With the dish, Thinkamancer links can exist over distances, and appear to be able to be broken with little repercussion. Any commander in the world is able to contact those Archons by concentrating hard enough and long enough - this allows Charlie to contact and hire out to any side in the world. The Arkendish may also be the reason Charlie can produce Archon units.\n\nA pair of red slippers, they give an attuned wearer unlimited move. The other mentioned ability is that they can send their wearer \"home\", depending on what home means to the one wearing them. As Overlady Judy's use of them in Book 0 has shown, can send you to a place where the concept of ruler does not apply (as that position was passed to Dame Branch)\n\nThe laws of nature governing Erfworld are similar to the rules of a turn-based strategy game. Forces are divided into \"sides\" each of which is controlled by an overlord or monarch; overlords and monarchs have powers over their units that are similar to those of a player in a strategy game.\n\nBattle takes place in turns; each side is able only to attack on its own turn, and no turns occur during the night. Each unit (a term that encompasses both various creatures and sapient beings) has a certain amount of \"Move,\" which governs the maximum distance it may travel during its side's turn. Thus, units may only travel to other locations during their turn, but at other times, they may move around within the bounds of the hexagonal region, or \"hex,\" where they ended up after their own turn.\n\nAll people in Erfworld appear fully formed as adults. Any side is able to \"pop\" new units each turn at each of its city sites. Units can learn new skills and gain promotion at a cost of time and money, or these abilities and ranks can simply be \"popped\" along with the unit. Each unit has an \"upkeep\" cost, paid by the overlord of its side out of the treasury. At the start of their side's turn, each unit receives rations, heals back to full health, and experiences minor maintenance such as personal cleanup.\n\nUnits have various battle stats associated with them. Each has a \"level\" as would a unit in a strategy game. Level determines power in battle and increases with successive victories. Certain units can also offer bonuses (temporary boosts in level) to the forces they are leading; warlords give a bonus to the troops they lead, as do certain casters. One of the stranger bonuses available is \"dance fighting,\" a bonus earned by dancing while fighting.\n\nOne of the more unusual features of the Erfworld universe is that it appears to be censored. When Parson is summoned to the world, he discovers almost immediately that whenever he attempts to use a word that could be considered a profanity it comes out as \"Boop\". Parson's reaction shows that this is an in-universe mechanic.\n\nThe natives of Erfworld apparently understand that the word represents profanity, but it is unclear whether they understand each boop as the word Parson had intended to use. Sizemore and Wanda are the only characters to have responded appropriately to a word that was \"booped out,\" but it is possible they determine the word's meaning from the context.\n\nThere is one notable exception to the general censorship. \"Crap\" has been used by the natives of Erfworld, both before and after Parson is summoned there. Only Jillian Zamussels' use of the word has been other than literal, though the earliest use by Lady Firebaugh could have been taken as both a literal observation and a curse word. Artist Jamie Noguchi has stated that he does not believe the word \"crap\" to be profanity.\n\nOn the second night after Stanley the Tool leaves Gobwin Knob, Parson overhears the Gobwin troops singing drinking songs which work around the restriction by alluding to—rather than explicitly describing—deficiencies in manhood among the Jetstone and Transylvito factions. For instance, he is surprised to learn that Erfworlders can use the word \"testes\". Other characters seem to have figured out their own loopholes; for example, one of Ansom's allies remarks that \"the Sofa King is Sofa-King finished here\" on page 117.\n\nArtist Jamie Noguchi once stated that Boop was originally supposed to be \"meep\".\n\nIn the final page of book one, in an act of defiance and anger Parson yells an uncensored \"Fuck you!!\" directed at Erfworld itself. Since then, none of Parson's swearing has been censored by Erfworld. The authors explained the page as pointing up the difference between censoring words (harming nobody) while simultaneously depicting or glorifying acts of mass violence (harming many).\n\nMagic can be performed in Erfworld by units called casters. Each caster has a specialty in one of twenty-four magical disciplines, but can theoretically cast in any discipline. These specialties can be combined by mentally linking casters together using the magical discipline of \"thinkamancy\"- a process that increases magical power but sometimes harms the casters involved when their link is broken.\n\nIt is explained in the second Parson's Klog, that three fundamental elements (Life, Motion, and Matter) are combined in all possible combinations to get eight major classes of magic. Magic within each class can be further aligned to any of three axes (Erf, Fate and Numbers), thus dividing each class into three disciplines. This gives a total of twenty-four disciplines, which are described - along with any known details - in the tables below:\n\n"}

{"id": "26044646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26044646", "title": "Federico Ramos", "text": "Federico Ramos\n\nFederico \"Freddy\" Ramos is a Uruguayan guitarist, arranger, producer and composer based in Santa Monica, California.\n\nHe began his career playing with Eduardo Mateo and Uruguayan rock bands Psiglo and Dias de Blues. He is credited with incorporating jazz, blues and rock influences to urban Uruguayan music as it is ascertained in the book \"De las Cuevas al Solís\" by Fernando Peláez. Federico later moved to southern Spain and eventually to Los Angeles where he is a specialty studio musician. He has shared stage, collaborated with, or recorded for artists Andy Williams, Dr. Yusef Lateef, Jon Anderson, Milton Nascimento, Ray Brown, Jr., Freddie Hubbard, Cheb Mami, Joan Sebastian, Alejandro Fernández, Vicente Fernández, Jon Hassell, Mark Isham, Elton John, James Moody, Terry Plumeri, Alphonso Johnson, Chester Thompson, and Dionne Warwick. Federico has participated in many films and television shows along films composers such as Hans Zimmer, John Powell, James Horner, Germaine Franco, Danny Elfman and Michael Giacchino. \n\nBorn in the big town Treinta y Tres, Uruguay, Federico began his studies in Montevideo, capital of the country. The musical roots of his ancestors first directed him to the Southern Coast of Spain and while residing in Sevilla and Jeréz de la Frontera Federico was involved with flamenco music. Nevertheless, he formally puto el que lee studied classical guitar at the Real Conservatorio de Madrid during the five-year residency. Formal studies were continued first at the Berklee College of Music in Massachusetts and later in California at the Guitar Institute of Technology (MI). In Valencia, at the California Institute of the Arts, he was the recipient of full scholarships. In due course Federico obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts and taught a course on Cross-Cultural Improvisation at the California Institute of the Arts.\n\nWhen Federico arrived in the United States in 1980, soon began expanding his musical and cultural spectrum. He settled in Santa Monica. In the eighties Federico co-founded Eternal Wind, a band whose music style was characterized by improvisational compositions of world sounds. Eternal Wind Dr. Charles Moore, Adam Rudolph, Ralphs Jones and Federico, recorded several albums that were released by the Chicago-based Flying Fish Records Co.. Soon, Eternal Wind toured extensively with Dr.Yusef Lateef, who then wrote and composed two symphonic works intended to be performed and recorded by Eternal Wind. One of them, \"The African-American Epic Suite for Quintet and Orchestra\" was recorded in Germany with the Köln Radio Orchestra in 1993, and released in Europe by ACT Records. As a member of Eternal Wind, Federico also participated in the recording of \"Metamusic\", also written and conducted by Dr. Lateef exclusively for his quartet. Later on, in 1995, the work \"The World at Peace\" of Yusef Lateef and Adam Rudolph (Eternal Wind) performed by 12 musicians, was released by Meta Records. This live performance at the Jazz Bakery of Los Angeles features Federico playing acoustic, electric and midi guitars throughout the session as well as his performance of percussion instruments and African kudu horn. References to Lateef and Eternal Wind association are further explored in Yusef Lateef's autobiography \"The Gentle Giant\".\n\nIn 1990, Federico Ramos, Eduardo Márquez Del Signore and Bernardo Rubaja worked in a debuting ensemble of compositions and performances. The ensemble fused ancient folk traditions of South America with an array of influences spanning jazz, pop, avant-garde and classical music. The instrumental textures and harmonic tints of their native cultures offered a unique and personalized style. Their recorded work \"Newland\", was released by Narada Productions, featuring Mark Isham on trumpet, Alex Acuña on drums and percussion and Steve Fowler on flutes. In 1991, Federico was introduced to the Englishman and pioneer artist Jon Anderson of the legendary progressive rock group \"Yes\", with whom he recorded. Subsequently, the Windham Hill releases of \"Deseo\", \"Toltec\", \"The Best Of Jon Anderson-South America 1993\" and \"Deseo Remixes\" followed. Federico toured as lead guitarist on Jon's Latin American tour of nine countries in 1993. In Belo Horizonte, Brazil, Federico was guest guitarist performing with Milton Nascimento, Simone and James Taylor, for a benefit presentation in the fight against hunger, Natal Sem Fome (Christmas Without Hunger).\n\nLater, the Uruguayan drummer José Luis Pérez joined Federico to create Pérez & Ramos. Their work \"Flip Flop\" expressed a contemporary improvisational music based primarily on the Uruguayan rhythms of candombe and African rhythms blending tango, Brazilian melodies and jazz. Pérez&Ramos' \"Flip Flop\" was well-reviewed after being released by World Alchemy Records in February 1994. During the year 1994, Federico was co-producer on the project \"Heart of Brazil\" with Dionne Warwick in the recording of Brazilian Artist Eliana Estevão.\n\nDuring those years, Ramos co-founded the group Hecho en México with musicians Luis Pérez Ixoneztly and Germaine Franco (with whom now he collaborates for film scores). Hecho en México's music was a junction of pre-Columbian sounds of instruments and language with other contemporary musical expressions.\n\nNorth Star released Calido's \"Tropical Nights\" in the year 1994. The duet of Federico and guitarist Ramon Stagnaro featured melodic songs with an array of exotic rhythms of Latin and Spanish compositions. Soon followed the collaboration with Michael Feinstein \"Michael & George: Feinstein Sings Gershwin\", which was nominated for a Grammy. The Savage Rose's disc \"For Your Love\" was granted the Gold Sales Award in Denmark in 2002. The recording of \"En Vivo Desde el Auditorio Nacional\" with Mexican superstar Joan Sebastian was awarded the Grammy for the 2006 best live disc. Also released in 2006 was a DVD of the Latin American Tour with Jon Anderson. For 2007, an educational disc for DW drums under the guide of Alex Acuña includes a vast array of Latin American styles.\n\nIn 1995 Federico again joined with Uruguayan drummer José Luis Pérez and Uruguayan bassist Eduardo Márquez Del Signore (Jon Anderson‘s Latin Band). The Trio found in the combination of their sounds the name of Ritual and the compact disc Presencia was released by Amazone Records. \"Presencia\" was presented in Montevideo, in the Teatro Solís in July 1997 with sold out tickets. Ritual traveled to Montevideo accompanied by their guest artist, pianist, composer and producer Tommy Eyre, the Englishman that had arranged Joe Cocker's version of \"A Little Help From My Friends\". From 1996, Federico engaged in different work projects, collaborations and special guest performances. Among these musical productions Federico's highlighted participations are: Cielo y Tierra: \"Heaven and Earth\", Warner-México 1996, with Jon Anderson, performing acoustic guitars and choirs; putoInternational Inc. 1997, guest guitarist; Adam Rudolph's Moving Pictures: Contemplations\", Meta Records 1997, acoustic guitars, charango, oud, bamboo flutes; Cayambe: \"Influences\", Andes Inc. 1997, guitars; Cayambe: America, Andes Inc. 1998, guitars; Heart & Soul\", North Sound Music Group 1999, flamenco guitarists (with individual performances also by Ramon Stagnaro and Adam Del Monte), soloist guitars, composer and arranger.\n\nDuring the early months of 1997, Sony Music contracted Federico as producer of Alexis Peña ‘s recording project. For this occasion Federico convoked the participation of renowned musicians such as Alex Acuña and Alphonso Johnson (\"Weather Report\"), Alex Ligertwood (\"Santana\") and Tommy Eyre (B.B. King, George Michael, Gary Moore). In February 2001 \"The African-American Epic Suite\" by Dr. Yusef Lateef with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.\n\nFor over a decade, Federico toured with famed, multi-Grammy award winner Mexican singer Joan Sebastian throughout Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and the U.S.. In 2016 and 2017, Federico toured with The Alphonso Johnson Band, feat. the maestro Chester Thompson in Chicago, and throughout Argentina and Uruguay, where he also taught clinics. He is a dedicated studio musician collaborating in recordings, and music for films and TV shows.\n\nRamos was the guitarist for the Disney animated film Coco, and performed one of the songs at the 90th Academy Awards.\n\nOther past collaborations include recordings and performances with the following artists\n\nUSA: Jackson Browne, Lionel Richie, Jon Hassell, Mark Isham, Norman Connors, Charlie Haden, Ahmed Abdul Malik, Scarlet Rivera, Cecil McBee, Billy Childs, Freddie Hubbard, Terry Plumeri, James Newton, Alphonso Johnson, Chester Thompson\n\nBRAZIL: Milton Nascimento, Moacir Santos, João Noguera, Martinho da Vila, Geraldo Azevedo, Jose Roberto Bertrami;\n\nINDIA: L.

{"id": "102445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102445", "title": "Graphic novel", "text": "Graphic novel\n\nA graphic novel is a book made up of comics content. Although the word \"novel\" normally refers to long fictional works, the term \"graphic novel\" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work. It is distinguished from the term \"comic book\", which is generally used for comics periodicals.\n\nFan historian Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\" in an essay in the November 1964 issue of the comics fanzine \"Capa-Alpha\". The term gained popularity in the comics community after the publication of Will Eisner's \"A Contract with God\" (1978) and the start of Marvel's Graphic Novel line (1982) and became familiar to the public in the late 1980s after the commercial successes of the first volume of Art Spiegelman's \"Maus\" in 1986 and the collected editions of Frank Miller's \"The Dark Knight Returns\" in 1986 and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' \"Watchmen\" in 1987. The Book Industry Study Group began using \"graphic novel\" as a category in book stores in 2001.\n\nThe term is not strictly defined, though Merriam-Webster's full dictionary definition is \"a fictional story that is presented in comic-strip format and published as a book\", while its simplest definition is given as \"cartoon drawings that tell a story and are published as a book\". In the publishing trade, the term extends to material that would not be considered a novel if produced in another medium. Collections of comic books that do not form a continuous story, anthologies or collections of loosely related pieces, and even non-fiction are stocked by libraries and bookstores as \"graphic novels\" (similar to the manner in which dramatic stories are included in \"comic\" books). The term is also sometimes used to distinguish between works created as standalone stories, in contrast to collections or compilations of a story arc from a comic book series published in book form.\n\nIn continental Europe, both original book-length stories such as \"La rivolta dei racchi\" (1967) by Guido Buzzelli, and collections of comics have been commonly published in hardcover volumes, often called \"albums\", since the end of the 19th century (including such later Franco-Belgian comics series as \"The Adventures of Tintin\" in the 1930s).\n\nAs the exact definition of the graphic novel is debated, the origins of the form are open to interpretation.\n\n\"The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck\" is the oldest recognized American example of comics used to this end. It originated as the 1828 publication \"Histoire de M. Vieux Bois\" by Swiss caricaturist Rodolphe Töpffer, and was first published in English translation in 1841 by London's Tilt & Bogue, which used an 1833 Paris pirate edition. The first American edition was published in 1842 by Wilson & Company in New York City using the original printing plates from the 1841 edition. Another early predecessor is \"Journey to the Gold Diggins by Jeremiah Saddlebags\" by brothers J. A. D. and D. F. Read, inspired by \"The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck\". In 1894 Caran d'Ache broached the idea of a \"drawn novel\" in a letter to the newspaper \"Le Figaro\" and started work on a 360-page wordless book (never published). In the United States there is a long tradition of reissuing previously published comic strips in book form. In 1897 the Hearst Syndicate published such a collection of \"The Yellow Kid\" by Richard Outcault and it quickly became a best seller.\n\nThe 1920s saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition, with Belgian Frans Masereel cited as \"the undisputed king\" of this revival. His works include \"Passionate Journey\" (1919). American Lynd Ward also worked in this tradition, publishing \"Gods' Man\", in 1929 and going on to publish more during the 1930s.\n\nOther prototypical examples from this period include American Milt Gross's \"He Done Her Wrong\" (1930), a wordless comic published as a hardcover book, and \"Une semaine de bonté\" (1934), a novel in sequential images composed of collage by the surrealist painter Max Ernst. Similarly, Charlotte Salomon's \"Life? or Theater?\" (composed 1941–43) combines images, narrative, and captions.\nThe 1940s saw the launching of \"Classics Illustrated\", a comic-book series that primarily adapted notable, public domain novels into standalone comic books for young readers. In 1947 Fawcett Comics published \"Comics Novel\" #1: \"Anarcho, Dictator of Death\", a 52-page comic dedicated to one story. In 1950, St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented \"picture novel\" \"It Rhymes with Lust\", a film noir-influenced slice of steeltown life starring a scheming, manipulative redhead named Rust. Touted as \"an original full-length novel\" on its cover, the 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer \"Drake Waller\" (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin proved successful enough to lead to an unrelated second picture novel, \"The Case of the Winking Buddha\" by pulp novelist Manning Lee Stokes and illustrator Charles Raab. Presaging Will Eisner's multiple-story graphic novel \"A Contract with God\" (1978), cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman wrote and drew the four-story mass-market paperback \"Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book\" (Ballantine Books #338K), published in 1959.\n\nBy the late 1960s, American comic book creators were becoming more adventurous with the form. Gil Kane and Archie Goodwin self-published a 40-page, magazine-format comics novel, \"His Name Is... Savage\" (Adventure House Press) in 1968—the same year Marvel Comics published two issues of \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" in a similar format. Columnist and comic-book writer Steven Grant also argues that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's Doctor Strange story in \"Strange Tales\" #130–146, although published serially from 1965–1966, is \"the first American graphic novel\". Similarly, critic Jason Sacks referred to the 13-issue \"Panther's Rage\"—comics' first-known titled, self-contained, multi-issue story arc—that ran from 1973 to 1975 in the Black Panther series in Marvel's \"Jungle Action\" as \"Marvel's first graphic novel\".\n\nMeanwhile, in continental Europe, the tradition of collecting serials of popular strips such as \"The Adventures of Tintin\" or \"Asterix\" led to long-form narratives published initially as serials.\n\nBy 1969, the author John Updike, who had entertained ideas of becoming a cartoonist in his youth, addressed the Bristol Literary Society, on \"the death of the novel\". Updike offered examples of new areas of exploration for novelists, declaring he saw \"no intrinsic reason why a doubly talented artist might not arise and create a comic strip novel masterpiece\".\n\nGil Kane and Archie Goodwin's \"Blackmark\" (1971), a science fiction/sword-and-sorcery paperback published by Bantam Books, did not use the term originally; the back-cover blurb of the 30th-anniversary edition () calls it, retroactively, \"the very first American graphic novel\". The Academy of Comic Book Arts presented Kane with a special 1971 Shazam Award for what it called \"his paperback comics novel\". Whatever the nomenclature, \"Blackmark\" is a 119-page story of comic-book art, with captions and word balloons, published in a traditional book format. It is also the first with an original heroic-adventure character conceived expressly for this form.\n\nEuropean creators were also experimenting with the longer narrative in comics form. In the United Kingdom, Raymond Briggs was producing works such as \"Father Christmas\" (1972) and \"The Snowman\" (1978), which he himself described as being from the \"bottomless abyss of strip cartooning\", although they, along with such other Briggs works as the more mature \"When the Wind Blows\" (1982), have been re-marketed as graphic novels in the wake of the term's popularity. Briggs notes, however, \"I don't know if I like that term too much\".\n\nIn 1976, the term \"graphic novel\" appeared in print to describe three separate works. \"Bloodstar\" by Richard Corben (adapted from a story by Robert E. Howard) used the term to define itself on its dust jacket and introduction. George Metzger's \"Beyond Time and Again\", serialized in underground comix from 1967 to 1972, was subtitled \"A Graphic Novel\" on the inside title page when collected as a 48-page, black-and-white, hardcover book published by Kyle & Wheary.\n\nThe digest-sized \"\" (1976) by Jim Steranko, designed to be sold on newsstands, used the term \"graphic novel\" in its introduction and \"a visual novel\" on its cover, although \"Chandler\" is more commonly considered an illustrated novel than a work of comics.\nThe following year, Terry Nantier, who had spent his teenage years living in Paris, returned to the United States and formed Flying Buttress Publications, later to incorporate as NBM Publishing (Nantier, Beall, Minoustchine), and published \"Racket Rumba\", a 50-page spoof of the noir-detective genre, written and drawn by the single-name French artist Loro. Nantier followed this with Enki Bilal's \"The Call of the Stars\". The company marketed these works as \"graphic albums\".\n\nThe first six issues of writer-artist Jack Katz's 1974 Comics and Comix Co. series \"The First Kingdom\" were collected as a trade paperback (Pocket Books, March 1978), which described itself as \"the first graphic novel\". Issues of the comic had described themselves as \"graphic prose\", or simply as a novel.\n\nSimilarly, \"Sabre: Slow Fade of an Endangered Species\" by writer Don McGregor and artist Paul Gulacy (Eclipse Books, August 1978)—the first graphic novel sold in the newly created \"direct market\" of United States comic-book shops—was called a \"graphic album\" by the author in interviews, though the publisher dubbed it a \"comic novel\" on its credits page. \"Graphic album\" was also the term used the following year by Gene Day for his hardcover short-story collection \"Future Day\" (Flying Buttress Press).\n\nAnother early graphic novel, though it carried no self-description, was \"The Silver Surfer\" (Simon & Schuster/Fireside Books, August 1978), by Marvel Comics' Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Significantly, this was published by a traditional book publisher and distributed through bookstores, as was cartoonist Jules Feiffer's \"Tantrum\" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1979) described on its dustjacket as a \"novel-in-pictures\".\n\nHyperbolic descriptions of longer comic books as \"novels\" appear on covers as early as the 1940s. Early issues of DC Comics' \"All-Flash Quarterly\", for example, described their contents as \"novel-length stories\" and \"full-length four chapter novels\".\n\nIn its earliest known citation, comic book reviewer Richard Kyle used the term \"graphic novel\" in \"Capa-Alpha\" #2 (November 1964), a newsletter published by the Comic Amateur Press Alliance, and again in an article in Bill Spicer's magazine \"Fantasy Illustrated\" #5 (Spring 1966). Kyle, inspired by European and East Asian graphic albums (especially the Japanese \"manga\"), used the label to designate comics of an artistically \"serious\" sort. Following this, Spicer, with Kyle's acknowledgment, edited and published a periodical titled \"Graphic Story Magazine\" in the fall of 1967. \"The Sinister House of Secret Love\" #2 (Jan. 1972), one of DC Comics' line of extra-length, 48-page comics, specifically used the phrase \"a graphic novel of Gothic terror\" on its cover.\n\nIn response to criticism regarding the content of comic books, and to the establishment of the industry's self-censorship Comics Code Authority, an underground alternative comix movement was created.\n\nThe term \"graphic novel\" began to grow in popularity months after it appeared on the cover of the trade paperback edition (though not the hardcover edition) of Will Eisner's \"A Contract with God\" (October 1978). This collection of short stories was a mature, complex work focusing on the lives of ordinary people in the real world based on Eisner's own experiences. The term \"graphic novel\" was intended to distinguish it from the traditional serialized nature of comic books, with which it shared a storytelling medium.\n\nOne scholar used graphic novels to introduce the concept of graphiation, a newly coined term used to describe graphic expression or visual enunciation. Graphiation refers to the theory that the entire personality of an artist is visible through his or her visual representation of a certain character, setting, event, or object in a novel, and as a means to examine and analyze drawing style.\n\nEven though Eisner’s \"A Contract with God\" was finally published in 1978 by a smaller company, Baronet Press, it took Eisner over a year to find a publishing house that would allow his work to reach the mass market. Eisner cited Lynd Ward's 1930s woodcuts (see above) as an inspiration.\n\nThe critical and commercial success of \"A Contract with God\" helped to establish the term \"graphic novel\" in common usage, and many sources have incorrectly credited Eisner with being the first to use it. These included the \"Time\" magazine website in 2003, which said in its correction, \"Eisner acknowledges that the term 'graphic novel' had been coined prior to his book. But, he says, 'I had not known at the time that someone had used that term before.' Nor does he take credit for creating the first graphic book.\"\nOne of the earliest contemporaneous applications of the term post-Eisner came in 1979, when \"Blackmark\"'s sequel—published a year after \"A Contract with God\" though written and drawn in the early 1970s—was labeled a \"graphic novel\" on the cover of Marvel Comics' black-and-white comics magazine \"Marvel Preview\" #17 (Winter 1979), where \"Blackmark: The Mind Demons\" premiered—its 117-page contents intact, but its panel-layout reconfigured to fit 62 pages.\n\nFollowing this, Marvel from 1982 to 1988 published the \"Marvel Graphic Novel\" line of 10\" × 7\" trade paperbacks—although numbering them like comic books, from #1 (Jim Starlin's \"The Death of Captain Marvel\") to #35 (Dennis O'Neil, Mike Kaluta, and Russ Heath's \"Hitler's Astrologer\", starring the radio and pulp fiction character the Shadow, and released in hardcover). Marvel commissioned original graphic novels from such creators as John Byrne, J. M. DeMatteis, Steve Gerber, graphic-novel pioneer McGregor, Frank Miller, Bill Sienkiewicz, Walt Simonson, Charles Vess, and Bernie Wrightson. While most of these starred Marvel superheroes, others, such as Rick Veitch's \"Heartburst\" featured original SF/fantasy characters; others still, such as John J. Muth's \"Dracula\", featured adaptations of literary stories or characters; and one, Sam Glanzman's \"A Sailor's Story\", was a true-life, World War II naval tale.\n\nCartoonist Art Spiegelman's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Maus\" (1986), helped establish both the term and the concept of graphic novels in the minds of the mainstream public. Two DC Comics book reprints of self-contained miniseries did likewise, though they were not originally published as graphic novels: \"\" (1986), a collection of Frank Miller's four-part comic-book series featuring an older Batman faced with the problems of a dystopian future; and \"Watchmen\" (1986-1987), a collection of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' 12-issue limited series in which Moore notes he \"set out to explore, amongst other things, the dynamics of power in a post-Hiroshima world\". These works and others were reviewed in newspapers and magazines, leading to increased coverage. Sales of graphic novels increased, with \"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\", for example, lasting 40 weeks on a UK best-seller list.\n\nOutside North America, Eisner's \"A Contract with God\" and Spiegelman's \"Maus\" led to the popularization of the expression \"graphic novel\" as well. Until then, most European countries used neutral, descriptive terminology that referred to the form of the medium, and not the contents. In Francophone Europe for example, the expression \"bandes dessinées\" – which literally translates as \"drawn strips\" – is used, while the terms \"stripverhaal\" (\"strip story\") and \"tegneserie\" (\"drawn series\") are used by the Dutch/Flemish and Scandinavians respectively. European comics studies scholars have observed that Americans originally used \"graphic novel\" to describe everything that deviated from their standard, 32-page comic book format, meaning that all larger-sized, longer Franco-Belgian comic albums, regardless of their contents, fell under the heading.\n\nAmerican comic critics occasionally refer to European graphic novels as \"Eurocomics\", and attempts were made in the late 1980s to cross-fertilize the American market with these works. American publishers Catalan Communications and NBM Publishing released translated titles, predominantly from the backlog catalogs of Casterman and Les Humanoïdes Associés.\n\nSome in the comics community have objected to the term \"graphic novel\" on the grounds that it is unnecessary, or that its usage has been corrupted by commercial interests. Writer Alan Moore believes,\n\nAuthor Daniel Raeburn wrote, \nWriter Neil Gaiman, responding to a claim that he does not write comic books but graphic novels, said the commenter:\n\nResponding to writer Douglas Wolk's quip that the difference between a graphic novel and a comic book is \"the binding\", \"Bone\" creator Jeff Smith said, \"I kind of like that answer. Because 'graphic novel' ... I don't like that name. It's trying too hard. It is a comic book. But there is a difference. And the difference is, a graphic novel is a novel in the sense that there is a beginning, a middle and an end.\" \"The Times\" writer Giles Coren said, \"To call them graphic novels is to presume that the novel is in some way 'higher' than the karmicbwurk (comic book), and that only by being thought of as a sort of novel can it be understood as an art form.\"\n\nSome alternative cartoonists have coined their own terms to describe extended comics narratives. The cover of Daniel Clowes' \"Ice Haven\" (2001) describes the book as \"a comic-strip novel\", with Clowes having noted that he \"never saw anything wrong with the comic book\". The cover of Craig Thompson's \"Blankets\" calls it \"an illustrated novel\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4500240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4500240", "title": "Ideal Toy Company", "text": "Ideal Toy Company\n\nIdeal Toy Company was an American toy company founded by Morris and Rose Michtom. During the post–World War II baby boom era, Ideal became the largest doll-making company in the United States. Their most popular dolls included Betsy Wetsy, Toni, Saucy Walker, Shirley Temple, Miss Revlon, Patti Playpal, Tammy, Thumbelina, Tiny Thumbelina, and Crissy. Their last big hit was the Rubik's Cube.\n\nMorris and Rose Michtom founded the Ideal Novelty and Toy Company in Brooklyn when they invented the Teddy bear in 1903. After Michtom's death in 1938, the company changed its name to the Ideal Toy Company, and Michtom's nephew Abraham Katz became chief executive.\n\nDuring World War II, the company's value rose from $2 million to $11 million. The company's dolls were so popular during the post–World War II baby boom era, they began selling dolls under license in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Brazil.\n\nKey Ideal employees during the 1950s, '60s, and '70s were Lionel A. Weintraub and Joseph C. Winkler. Weintraub, the son-in-law of Abraham Katz, joined the company in 1941 and rose to become president, chairman of the board, and chief executive officer. Winkler joined Ideal in 1956, rising to vice president by 1971.\n\nIn 1951, Ideal partnered with competitors the American Character Doll Company and the Alexander Doll Company to establish the United States-Israeli Toy and Plastic Corporation, designed to produce material for toys in Israel and the U.S. Ideal CEO Abraham Katz was named president of the new company.\n\nIn 1968, the American Character Doll Company filed for bankruptcy, and Ideal acquired the defunct company's dyes, patents, and trademarks, as well as specific products like the \"Tressy\" Gro-Hair doll.\n\nIn late 1971, Ideal joined the New York Stock Exchange; valued at $71 million, it was one of the U.S.'s top three toy companies.\n\nBy 1970, Ideal had outgrown its manufacturing complex in Hollis, Queens. The company wanted to build a new plant in College Point, Queens (later the site of Shea Stadium), but was unable to strike a deal with the Lindsay administration. Consequently, the company opened a new facility in Newark, New Jersey, in the early 1970s, while continuing to operate its factory in Hollis.\n\nIdeal had earnings of $3.7 million in fiscal year 1979-1980, but lost $15.5 million in fiscal year 1980-1981. (Sales both years averaged c. $150 million.) Trying to maximize profits on the Rubik's Cube craze, in May 1981 Ideal filed civil suits against dozens of distributors and retailers selling knockoff cubes.\n\nIn May 1981, Joseph Winkler was named Ideal's president, succeeding Lionel Weintraub, who remained chairman and CEO.\n\nIn 1982, the company moved its headquarters from Hollis, Queens, to Harmon Meadow, New Jersey. It was sold to CBS Toys later that year for c. $58 million.\n\nIn 1987, CBS sold Ideal to Viewmaster International, which renamed itself View-Master Ideal in the process.\n\nIn 1989, View-Master Ideal was bought by Tyco Toys of Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, for $43.9 million. The Ideal line remained part of Tyco until Tyco’s merger with Mattel, Inc., in 1997.\n\nIdeal's United Kingdom assets were sold to Hasbro, which has since released Mouse Trap and KerPlunk under its MB Games brand. Other toys that originated with Ideal continue to be marketed and sold by other companies, including Rubik's Cube by Hasbro and Magic 8-ball by Mattel.\n\nThe Ideal brand was revived by Plaza Toys on its Fiddlestix building sticks products, but by January 2011 was a Poof-Slinky brand.\n\nIn January 2014, the Ideal brand became part of a new company, Alex Brands, after the May 2013 acquisition of Alex Toys by Propel Equity Partners.\n\nIdeal began making dolls in 1907 to complement its line of teddy bears. Their first doll was “Yellow Kid” from Richard Felton Outcault's comic strip of the same name. After that Ideal began making a line of baby and character dolls such as Naughty Marietta (from the Victor Herbert operetta), and Admiral Dot. Ideal advertised their dolls as \"unbreakable,\" since they were made of composition, a material made of sawdust and glue. Ideal produced over 200 variations of dolls throughout the composition era.\n\nUnderstanding branding well, Ideal had a boy doll launched in 1914 named the Uneeda Kid, after a biscuit company.\n\nOne of Ideal's most lasting products was Betsy Wetsy, introduced in 1934 and in production for more than 50 years. The doll was named after the daughter of Abraham Katz, the head of the company. Ideal, via the Betsy Wetsy doll, was also one of the first doll manufacturers to produce an African American version of a popular doll. In 2003, the Toy Industry Association named Betsy Wetsy to its Century of Toys List, a compilation commemorating the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.\n\nDebuting in 1934, the Shirley Temple doll was their best-selling doll. Ideal follow up with licensed Disney dolls and a Judy Garland doll.\n\nTwo cosmetics-based doll series were launched after World War II: Toni was introduced at the end of the 1940s, followed by the 1950s-dominating Miss Revlon series.\n\nIdeal had a hobby division in the 1950s, but shifted from that to games in 1962. By the early 1970s, 30% of the company's sales were games such as Mouse Trap and Hands Down.\n\nDoll designer Judith Albert worked for Ideal Toy Company from 1960–1982. Master sculptor Vincent J. DeFilippo spent 27 years creating dolls for Ideal from 1963–1980. Some of the company's most popular dolls during this period were Tammy (1962–1966), Flatsy dolls (1969–1973), Crissy (1969–1974), and Tressy (1970–1972).\n\nPopular Ideal toys in the 1970s included a full line of Evel Knievel toys, Snoopy toys, and the Tuesday Taylor and Wake-up Thumbelina dolls.\n\nFor a short time, the company had a huge seller with the Magic Cube, which it imported from Hungary in 1980 and renamed Rubik's Cube.\n\n\n\n(Reference Packaging) https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1952-Lucille-Ball-Beautiful-I-Love-Lucy-Rag-Doll-Mint-in-Original-Box-/152788070611?_trksid=p2047675.l2557&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&nma=true&si=%252FkTztth6WWZnnOCVdUpZDONlz%252FY%253D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc\n"}
{"id": "47279111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47279111", "title": "Kineikonic Mode", "text": "Kineikonic Mode\n\nThe kineikonic mode is a term for the moving image as a multimodal form. It indicates an approach to the analysis of film, video, television and any instance of moving image media that examines how systems of signification such as image, speech, dramatic action, music and other communicative processes work together to create meaning within the spatial and temporal frames of filming and editing.\n\nAs a way of exploring how informal digital video production involved not only the familiar functions of filming and editing, but also the dramatization of identity, drawing from film theory and multimodality theory, Andrew Burn and David Parker coined the term kineikonic in 2003 by combining the Greek words \"kinein\" meaning \"to move\" and \"eikon\" meaning \"image\". Kineikonic analysis pays attention to how the modes of the moving image, such as speech, music, dramatic action, work together in kineikonic texts, be they film, video, videogame or animation, by observing both the modes within an individual frame and also how these modes work together throughout the temporal sequence of the text, both within and beyond the level of the shot. In this sense, the kineikonic model disputes Metz's proposal that there can be no grammar of film below the level of the shot. The concept of 'mode' stems from multimodal theory, and refers to 'a set of socially and culturally shaped resources for making meaning. Mode classifies a ‘channel’ of representation or communication for which previously no overarching name had been proposed'. By examining modes, such as sound, movement, image, and gesture, analysts can understand how the meaning of a text is constructed across and between the signifying systems of these semiotic forms.\n\nOne can understand the kineikonic mode by examining each mode individually, such as tracing the rhythm, melody or harmonic patterns of the music in and across the shots of a film. However, a central proposition of the kineikonic is a theory of how the 'contributory' modes are organized by the 'orchestrating modes' of filming and editing: how they have been juxtaposed to work both through the space of the film (the frames), and through the timeline of the film, the movement through time of the images, as well as the time-based modes of language, music and sound.\n\nThe kineikonic mode has been important in contemporary analyses of filmic text because it moves beyond the dominant emphasis in film studies on the processes of filming and editing to a common set of semiotic principles operating across all the modes involved. The kineikonic mode provides a language with which to analyze the elements within and throughout a film in a way that recognizes how all of the pieces of the film work both by themselves and together to create meaning. In deploying a multimodal and social semiotic theory of communication, it also allows for a common analytical framework to be applied across the moving image text and its context, so that the text can be analysed in relation to the meanings created by different media of exhibition (projectors, the internet, mobile phones), and by their discursive surroundings (cinemas, YouTube, tablet interfaces), as well as in relation to their regimes of production and reception.\n\nSince its coining in 2003, the theory of the kineikonic mode has been expanded in several ways. Some have examined how tracing the kineikonic mode can show how particular youth identities are represented in youth-produced videos, such as representing a Native self through the ways in which various modes are highlighted and put together., or how primary school children use embodied modes of action and self-representation to invoke memory and construct identity. Another expansion of the theory is to examine in more detail how time works in the orchestration of the modes. Andrew Burn has expanded his own theory to discuss both this new temporal understanding of the kinekonic, but also by developing the idea of the \"metamodal kineikonic\". The metamodal kineikonic shows how modes \"nest\" in one another and how this nesting can be analysed at whatever level suits the purposes of the analyst, whether it be at the orchestrating level or at the smallest level of granularity, such as tonal contour in spoken language, or a lighting change.\n"}

They were to be enemies, just as Antu and Peripillán were. Caicai was sent to live in the sea to help care for it with the Ngen-ko (water spirits), and Tenten was sent to live on earth to help care for the earth with the other Ngen, and to help humanity; thus these two snakes were used as an instrument through which the will of the ancient Mapuche spirits was fulfilled.\n\nIt is said that after Caicai awoke from his years-long slumber,he became enraged because of the ungratefulness that men showed for every gift given to them by the sea and thus used his fish-shaped tail to hit the water. With it began a great flood, since he had the desire to punish humanity and to incorporate all terrestrial life to its dominions. Caicai ordered the waters to flood the valleys and hills, and to bring all its inhabitants to the bottom of the sea.\n\nSeeing Tenten, that both humans and animals were desperate and that men invoked her, and as by orders of her father, she was the one who had to provide them with wisdom and protection; she decided to help humanity. Thus she helped the inhabitants and the animals to escape by raising them on her back and taking them to the hills; and she transformed into birds those who were trapped by the waters, so they could escape by flying; those who were drowning into fish and marine mammals (one of them being the origin of the cahuelche (talking dolphin)), and those who had already drowned in sumpall (Mapuche mermen and mermaids). Those who were immobilized by the terror they felt, were transformed into mankial (petrified). But as the sea continued to rise, Tenten had to order the hills to increase in height to counteract the power of Caicai. Angry, Caicai began to fight against Tenten in a titanic battle that lasted a long time, until both snakes were tired.Caicai was partially defeated as he wasn't able to flood all the land, however, the waters did not return completely to their old level, giving Chile its current geography.\n\nAccording to Chiloé tradition,Caicai was satisfied with the portion of land that he had managed to flood, and delegated his functions pertaining to the sea to the great Millalobo.\n\nAccording to Mapuche tradition, after the cataclysm, everyone continued their quiet life; until one day it was Tenten who was angered by the attitude that men had, and made all the volcanoes erupt and the population had to move to other safer places. From that moment on, Tenten continues to manifest itself through earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, while Caicai causes tidal waves and floods when he rolls over during his sleep.\n\nA variant of the myth tells that Caicai's anger against human beings began because a girl rejected her son, the Trauco.\n\nSome Huilliche communities of Chiloé say that the battle originated because a daughter of the Trauco rejected the pillán Peripillán, and for this reason her son decided to take revenge.\n\nIn Argentina there are other later versions of the myth, which change the original parents of both mythical snakes, indicating that they would be brothers and/or sons of the gods Nguenechèn and Kueyen. \n\n\n"}

Note that if \"v\" and \"w\" are the origins of R and R\nrespectively, then (\"v\",\"w\") is completely labeled.\nWe say that (\"v\",\"w\") is \"almost completely labeled\" (with respect to some missing label \"g\")\nif the sets associated with \"v\" and \"w\"\ncontain all labels in {1, ..., \"m\" + \"n\"} other than \"g\".\nNote that in this case, there will be a \"duplicate label\" that is associated with both\n\"v\" and \"w\".\n\nA \"pivot operation\" consists of taking some pair (\"v\",\"w\") and replacing \"v\" with some\nvertex adjacent to \"v\" in P, or alternatively replacing \"w\" with some\nvertex adjacent to \"w\" in P. This has the effect (in the case that\n\"v\" is replaced) of replacing some label of \"v\" with some other label.\nThe replaced label is said to be \"dropped\". Given any label of \"v\", it is possible\nto drop that label by moving to a vertex adjacent to \"v\" that does not contain the\nhyperplane associated with that label.\n\nThe algorithm starts at the completely labeled pair (\"v\",\"w\") consisting of the pair of\norigins. An arbitrary label \"g\" is dropped via a pivot operation, taking us to\nan almost completely labeled pair (\"v′\",\"w′\"). Any almost completely labeled pair\nadmits two pivot operations corresponding to dropping one or other copy of its\nduplicated label, and each of these operations may result in another almost completely\nlabeled pair, or a completely labeled pair. Eventually the algorithm finds a\ncompletely labeled pair (\"v\",\"w\"), which is not the origin.\n(\"v\",\"w\") corresponds to a pair of unnormalised probability distributions\nin which every strategy \"i\" of player 1 either pays that player 1, or pays less than 1 and is played\nwith probability 0 by that player (and a similar observation holds for\nplayer 2). Normalizing these values to probability distributions, we have a Nash\nequilibrium (whose payoffs to the players are the inverses of the normalization\nfactors).\n\nThe algorithm can find at most \"n\" + \"m\" different Nash equilibria. Any choice of\ninitially-dropped label determines the equilibrium that is eventually found by\nthe algorithm.\n\nThe Lemke–Howson algorithm is equivalent to the following homotopy-based approach.\nModify \"G\" by selecting an arbitrary pure strategy \"g\", and giving the player who owns\nthat strategy, a large payment \"B\" to play it. In the modified game, that strategy \"g\"\nis played with probability 1, and the other player will play his best response\nto \"g\" with probability 1. Consider the continuum of games in which \"B\" is\ncontinuously reduced to 0. There exists a path of Nash equilibria connecting\nthe unique equilibrium of the modified game, to an equilibrium of \"G\".\nThe pure strategy \"g\" chosen to receive the bonus \"B\" corresponds to the\ninitially dropped label.\nWhile the algorithm is efficient in practice, in the worst case the number\nof pivot operations may need to be exponential in the number of pure strategies\nin the game.\n\nSubsequently, it has been shown that it is PSPACE-complete to find any of the solutions\nthat can be obtained with the Lemke–Howson algorithm.\n"}

The \"Souvenirs de la Marquise de Créquy\" is attributed to her by university librarians.\n\nIn her \"Souvenirs\", which consists mainly of accurate noble genealogies and court gossip from the reigns of Louis XIV, Louis XV, Louis XVI and Napoleon, there is a tale for which the author of the \"Souvenirs\" is the sole authority. This story, widely believed in France, is her statement, with a detailed story to back it up, that Britain's national anthem, \"God Save the Queen\", was in fact written by Lully and sung by a French girls' school to greet Louis XIV. The French author of \"Souvenirs\" further states that the tune was later plagiarized by Handel and sold to the British crown as their anthem.\n\nIf it is true, as some have claimed, that the story about the sale of the anthem is actually from a much later tabloid, then this anachronism is a reason why the author of \"Souvenirs\" is sometimes placed in the company of forgers, alongside the authors of such works as the \"Historia Augusta\", \"De Situ Britanniae\", and Annio of Viterbo. If, on the other hand, the French tabloids of the 1850s published Madame de Créquy's story based on her memoirs, it's possible she believed the story to be true, or that the story is true.\n\n"}

In November 2004, Geneon USA signed a deal with Toei Animation to distribute some of their titles into the North American market. Launching titles included \"Air Master\", \"Interlude\", and \"Slam Dunk\". However, in late 2006, the deal ended and all of the released titles went out of print.\n\nIn March 2007, Geneon became the exclusive North American distributor for Bandai Visual USA. Four months later, it was announced that ADV Films would take over the distribution, marketing, and sales of Geneon USA's properties in the United States, starting October 1, 2007. According to the announcement, Geneon USA would continue to acquire, license, and produce English subs and dubs of anime for release in North America. However, the deal was canceled in September before it was implemented, with neither company giving details as to why beyond stating they were \"unable to reach a mutual agreement.\"\n\nOn December 3, Geneon USA closed distribution operations, with titles solicited through November 5 shipped. Titles that were in mid-release or licensed but unreleased were left in limbo. The Bandai Visual USA titles that were being distributed by Geneon were not affected by this closure, though some were delayed while Bandai Visual found a new distributor. Another North American anime company, Funimation Entertainment, began negotiating with Geneon USA to distribute some of the company's licensed titles. In July 2008, a formal arrangement was announced and Funimation acquired the rights to \"manufacture, sell, and distribute\" various Geneon anime and live-action titles. Former Geneon USA titles has since been re-licensed by other companies such as Funimation, Aniplex of America, Sentai Filmworks, Media Blasters, Discotek Media, Nozomi Entertainment, Maiden Japan, Viz Media, NIS America, Ponycan USA and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\nOn November 12, 2008, Dentsu announced that it was selling 80.1% of its ownership in the company to NBCUniversal's Universal Pictures International Entertainment (UPI), who planned to merge the company with its Universal Pictures Japan division to form a new company.

The game combines features that were first seen in \"RollerCoaster Tycoon\" and \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 2\", which were both amusement park management simulators created by Chris Sawyer for the PC. The game was released worldwide for iOS and Android in December 2016, while a version for Microsoft Windows and macOS was released in September 2017.\n\n\"Classic\" implements the same gameplay as the first two games in the \"RollerCoaster Tycoon\" series. Played from an isometric view, players are tasked with building or revitalizing an amusement park by adding rides, attractions, facilities, paths, landscaping, and staff to manage the park. In particular, the game allows players to plan out a wide array of custom roller coasters and other rides using tracks, such as log flumes and go-karts. The player also must manage the park's finances to make sure they bring in sufficient revenues from guests to cover the cost of running the park and installing new features.\n\nChris Sawyer had developed the original \"RollerCoaster Tycoon\" and its sequel \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 2\", which released respectively in 1999 and 2002. The games had come out of his work developing a sequel to \"Transport Tycoon\", which he released in 1994. Sawyer allowed Frontier Developments to develop \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\" while he worked on \"Locomotion\", a 2004 spiritual successor to \"Transport Tycoon\". Following this release, Sawyer had appeared to disappear from the games industry; according to Sawyer in a 2016 interview, he took this absence in part over the legal difficulties he had over securing unpaid royalties from Atari, whom had acquired the rights to publish the \"RollerCoaster Tycoon\" series through Infogrames purchase of Hasbro Interactive. He also stated that he was disappointed with the state of video games during this period which focused too much on violence. \n\nSawyer re-emerged in 2010 with the opening of 31X Ltd. a holding company for his \"Transport Tycoon\" intellectual property. However, he saw there was interest in a mobile version of this game, and took 31X in a direction towards mobile development. In 2013, he announced the mobile version of \"Transport Tycoon\", developed with Origin8. With Origin8's help, Sawyer was able to convert the original \"Transport Tycoon\" code from a form that relied heavily on assembly code to transfer it into a more portable form. The title was released in late 2013. He considered the mobile release of \"Transport Tycoon\" a success, and that Origin8 was willing to continue to help port \"RollerCoaster Tycoon\" into a similar mobile format. Sawyer also recognized that there was a demand for a game that used the more simple controls and graphics offered in the original \"Tycoon\" games, which worked well for mobile and touch-screen devices. \n\nIn March 2016, Sawyer affirmed he had started work on \"RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic\" with Origin8, to be released for mobile devices. As with the rework of \"Transport Tycoon\", this required Sawyer and Origin8 to rework the assembly code from \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 2\" into C. They were also able to add new elements to the game during this period.\n\nThe game was released for both Android and iOS devices on December 22, 2016. On that same day, Sawyer released a statement explaining his reason for developing the game: \"It was my long term ambition to bring the classic game to modern touch screen devices as its visual style and tactile nature are so well suited to smartphones and tablets.\" Meanwhile, the CEO of Atari stated that the game should appeal to both long-time fans, as well as new players.\n\nA Microsoft Windows and macOS port of the game was released on September 28, 2017.\n\nBob Fekete of \"iDigitalTimes\" praised the game for faithfully porting the original games on mobile devices for a low price tag, but criticized the game's \"cramped\" feel and occasionally low framerates.\n"}

By 1900 he was living with his parents and siblings in Cincinnati, Ohio, and in 1910 lived in Chicago. He was unrelated to Sam Ash, born Samuel Ashkynase (1897–1956), founder of the eponymous musical instrument store, despite some erroneous claims that they were one and the same person.\n\nHe first recorded as a tenor singer for Columbia Records in 1914, and the following year found success in a duet with Elida Morris, \"Hello Frisco!\" from the Broadway musical \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1915\". In December 1915 he appeared on the Broadway stage, in a leading role in Rudolf Friml's operetta \"Katinka\", which ran for over 200 performances. \nHe recorded regularly for Columbia over the next few years. In 1915 he made one of his most commercially successful recordings, \"America, I Love You\", and in 1917 he recorded \"Cleopatra Had a Jazz Band\". His regular appearances in Broadway revues included \"Doing Our Bit\" (1917), \"Monte Cristo Jr.\" (1919), and \"Oh, What A Girl!\" (1919) among others. In the 1920s he continued to record for Columbia as well as for a number of other record labels, including Little Wonder, Gennett, Grey Gull, and OKeh. He also continued to appear in Broadway musicals, including \"Some Party\" in 1922, \"The Passing Show of 1922\", and \"Houseboat on the Styx\" in 1928.\n\nFrom 1929, he was based in Hollywood. He made his film debut that year, third on the bill as a suspect in the Craig Kennedy mystery \"Unmasked\", starring Robert Warwick in his first \"talkie\". Over the next two decades he had hundreds of small parts in movies, playing characters such as waiters, news vendors, ship stewards, and reporters. In \"Mad Love\", starring Peter Lorre, his role was one of the detectives seeking the murderer. In \"It's a Wonderful Life\", in 1946, he played the part of the nervous bank teller trying to calm the crowd when they demand their savings. Ash also featured in a number of popular film serials such as \"Dick Tracy\", \"The Masked Marvel\", and \"Captain America\".

{"id": "364035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=364035", "title": "Television in New Zealand", "text": "Television in New Zealand\n\nTelevision in New Zealand was introduced in 1960 as a state-run service. The broadcasting sector was deregulated in 1989, when the Government allowed competition to the state-owned Television New Zealand (TVNZ). There are currently three forms of broadcast television: a terrestrial (DVB-T) service provided by Freeview; satellite services provided nationwide by both Freeview and Sky; and an internet television service delivered over cable and fibre broadband.\n\nThe first nationwide digital television service was launched in December 1998 by Sky, who had a monopoly on digital satellite television until the launch of Freeview's nationwide digital satellite service in May 2007. The Freeview digital terrestrial service launched on 14 April 2008. A pay digital terrestrial service was launched in 2012 by Igloo and closed in 2017; this was a joint venture between Sky and TVNZ and provided Freeview UHF aerial channels along with eleven Sky channels. Broadband television currently operates from Vodafone. On July 2016, Sky announced that Igloo will be discontinued although Freeview channels will still be available. The Vodafone service includes all Sky channels and Freeview channels.\n\nThe digital changeover in New Zealand is now complete. It began on 30 September 2012, when Hawke's Bay and the West Coast (including parts of Tasman) switched off analogue television transmission. The rest of the South Island switched off analogue television transmission on 28 April 2013, followed by the lower North Island on 29 September 2013. The upper North Island (including the Waikato, Auckland, Bay of Plenty and Northland) was the last region to cease analogue transmissions on 1 December 2013.\n\nFull-time television broadcasting was first introduced in New Zealand in 1960 and transmitted from the NZBC's existing 1YA radio broadcasting facility at 74 Shortland Street in Auckland, now home to the University of Auckland's Gus Fisher Gallery. The annual television licence fee was NZ£4. Prime Minister Walter Nash had made a surprise announcement (a surprise both to the NZBS and to other members of the Labour government) in London in November 1959 that New Zealand would have television within twelve months; the system was to be state-owned but to carry commercials, and would be introduced in stages in the four main centres. The first non-experimental programme was transmitted on Wednesday 1 June 1960.\n\nInitially, programming was done on a regional basis, with different services broadcasting from the main cities, AKTV2 in Auckland, being the first on 1 June 1960, followed in 1961 by CHTV3 in Christchurch on 1 June and WNTV1 in Wellington on 1 July, and then DNTV2 in Dunedin on 31 July 1962. Today, however, programming and scheduling is done in Auckland where all the major networks are now headquartered.\n\nNational won the 1960 election, and the new Minister of Broadcasting, Arthur Kinsella in the new National government rewrote the Broadcasting Act of 1936, and set up the state-owned New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC) in 1962 to control public radio and television (although the party had been polarised between having a state-owned, private enterprise or mixed system). \n\nThe first broadcast relay stations were commissioned in 1963, extending television coverage to Hamilton, Tauranga and Palmerston North. Coverage was further expanded to Napier-Hastings and Invercargill in 1964, Timaru in 1965, and Whangarei and New Plymouth in 1966.\n\nAdvertising was introduced to Aucklanders on 4 April 1961, and facilitated increasing transmission hours to twenty-eight per week. By 1962 there were 65,000 licences, by 1963 there were 80,000 licences and an estimated audience of 300,000 or one-eighth of the population, and by 1966 there were half a million licences. By the 1970s, almost every household had a set. \n\nInitially, the hours of transmission were from 5pm until close at about 10pm, later extending, in 1966, to 2pm opening. A test pattern was transmitted from 9am to allow for adjustment of TV sets in homes by technicians.\n\nIt was not until 1969 that the four stations were networked; the NZBC's first live network news bulletin was read by Dougal Stevenson on Wednesday 5 November.\n\nThe NZBC had asked the Government for the approval of a second TV channel as early as 1964, but this was rejected as the Government considered increasing coverage of the existing TV service to be of greater priority. By 1971, however, two proposals for a second channel were under consideration: that of the NZBC for a non-commercial service; and a separate commercial channel to be operated by an Independent Television Corporation, headed by Gordon Dryden.\n\nAlthough the Broadcasting Authority had favoured the Independent Television Corporation bid, the incoming Labour government favoured the NZBC's application and awarded it the licence without any formal hearings beforehand. (Eventually, Independent Television was awarded NZ$50,000 in compensation.)\n\nOn Wednesday 31 October 1973, colour television using the Phase Alternating Line (PAL) system was introduced, in readiness for the 1974 British Commonwealth Games, which were to be held in Christchurch in January and February 1974. The final switchover for colour television was in December 1975.\n\nThe introduction of a second TV channel (then called TV2) on Monday 30 June 1975 also saw the reorganisation of broadcasting in New Zealand. The NZBC was dissolved in April of that year, with the two television channels, Television One and TV2, run separately from one another. TV2 was renamed South Pacific Television in 1976.\n\nIn 1978, the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand (BCNZ) was established, and in 1980, TV One and South Pacific (known once again as TV2) were merged into a single organisation, Television New Zealand (TVNZ).\n\nIn 1988, following major economic reforms to the state sector, the BCNZ was dissolved. TVNZ and Radio New Zealand (RNZ) became separate \"State-Owned Enterprises\" (SOEs) which would have to compete commercially and return dividends to the Crown.\n\nRather than continuing to be used to directly fund TVNZ and RNZ, the licence fee, now called the broadcasting fee, was to be used for local content production and the state funding for non-commercial broadcasting in radio and television on a contestable basis. As part of wide-ranging reforms in the broadcasting sector, the Labour government of David Lange established the Broadcasting Commission, which became known as and finally called New Zealand on Air.\n\nBroadcasting in New Zealand was deregulated in 1989. Restrictions on television advertising were also revised in 1989, so that TVNZ channels could show advertisements anytime except Christmas Day, Good Friday, and Easter Sunday, and between 6am and noon on Anzac Day. In that year, TV3 became the first privately owned TV station in the country, finally ending the state monopoly. Restrictions on foreign ownership were also removed, and TV3 was subsequently sold to Canada's CanWest. Sky TV, in which TVNZ originally had a small stake, began broadcasting New Zealand's first pay TV service on three UHF channels.\n\nOther free-to-air commercial television operators now include TV3's sister channel Four (previously known as C4) and Prime TV. Sky TV remains the dominant pay-TV operator, now operating on satellite, although Vodafone also operates cable TV services.\n\nAlthough TVNZ had to compete with its commercial rivals through the 1990s, it maintained a dominant market position and paid a significant amount of its profits to the Crown in dividends. By 1998–1999, the National Party–led coalition was moving to privatise TVNZ and announced that the broadcasting fee would be discontinued. Since the 1970s, the licence fee had been capped at NZ$100 a year, and was not allowed to increase with inflation. In real terms, this meant that public funding of broadcasting in New Zealand was greatly reduced by the time of the broadcasting fee's abolition.\n\nHowever, the 1999 election saw a Labour-led coalition gain office. Over its next two terms, attempts were made to reintroduce public service functions to the sector. In 2003, TVNZ was restructured as a Crown-Owned Company with a public service Charter. The Charter, abolished by the Key National government in 2008, received a small amount of government subsidy, but TVNZ remains predominantly dependent on commercial revenue and is obliged to continue paying dividends to the Crown.\n\nIt can apply to NZ On Air (funded directly from the Government since 2000) for support in local content initiatives, such as drama and comedy, and funding of programming for minority groups such as gay, Christian and rural New Zealanders. The funding of Maori programming has since passed to Te Mangai Paho, the Maori broadcasting commission.\n\nIn 2004, the Maori Television Service was established to promote Maori language and culture. MTS is funded partly through direct government funding and partly through commercial advertising, but is eligible for contestable programming funds from Te Mangai Paho.\n\nIn 2006, the Government announced the introduction of two new non-commercial digital television services operated by TVNZ, offering drama, arts, documentary and children's programming called TVNZ 6 and TVNZ 7. However, after a change of Government, funding for the two channels was not renewed. In 2011, the children's channel, TVNZ 6, was replaced by the commercial youth channel TVNZ U, leaving New Zealand with no free to air children's television. TVNZ Kidzone 24 was subsequently established, but was only available behind a Sky TV pay wall before it ceased broadcasting in 2016. TVNZ 7 ceased broadcasting on 30 June 2012, with a number of its programs being picked up by other channels. In response, public broadcasting advocates announced plans to form a new lobby group.\n\nFreeview is a non-profit organisation providing free-to-air digital television and digital radio to New Zealand. The Freeview service is available via satellite throughout New Zealand. Freeview's terrestrial service is a high definition digital terrestrial television service available to 75 percent of the country's population, using DVB-S and DVB-T standards on government provided spectrum.\n\nAnalogue switchoff in New Zealand was completed on 1 December 2013. A major benefit of digital television is the ability to overcome the poor reception caused by New Zealand's rugged topography. Digital TV offers more channels, better pictures and sound quality and new services such as on-screen programme guides.\n\nIt was estimated that on 31 December 2008, 198,938 Freeview certified set-top boxes and IDTVs had been sold since the platform's launch (146,416 Satellite, 52,522 UHF). It is estimated that Freeview is in 12.6% of New Zealand homes (roughly 420,000 people). This makes it New Zealand's third largest television platform, and New Zealand's second largest digital platform. Freeview-certified set-top boxes and PVRs are available at most major New Zealand retailers. Cheaper, uncertified equipment can also be used.\n\nNew Zealand's deregulated broadcasting environment has led to many regional stations (either non-commercial public service or privately owned) that broadcast only in one region or city. These stations mainly broadcast free to air on UHF frequencies, although some are carried on subscription TV. Content ranges from local news, access broadcasts, satellite sourced news, tourist information and Christian programming to music videos. Over a dozen regional television stations in New Zealand are grouped by the Regional Broadcasters Association.\n\nMany digital channels are broadcast into New Zealand via satellite. These include Freeview, Sky Television, and many Australian and other channels. Most can be received using a standard blind-scan capable set-top box in addition to the standard 60 cm satellite dish that is fitted to many houses.\n\nNew Zealand has a number of television channels that are, or have been, only available on pay television networks.\n\n\nIn 2014, streaming television entered the New Zealand market. About one quarter of the population now use streaming as a form of television. Service providers include:\n\nFree providers include: \n\n\n\n"}

On May 27, 2013, the music video was released for \"Rap vs. Real\".\n\n\"The Greatest Story Never Told Chapter 2: Bread and Circuses\" was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69, based on 6 reviews, which indicates \"positive reviews\". Robert Christgau of MSN Music found the album \"slightly less militant and, as a direct result, stronger\" than its predecessor and stated, \"almost nothing here dips to ordinary. And beats or not, one reason is that the rapper's rough clarity is musical bedrock.\" Chris Dart of \"Exclaim!\" gave the album a seven out of ten, saying \"Saigon's only downfall is that sometimes he's just a little too earnest. Social conscience and political awareness are good, but occasionally they feel too much like he's making us eat our vegetables. \"Brownsville Girl\" comes across like an after-school special, while \"Blown Away\" is just straight-up ham-fisted in its tales of social injustice. These missteps aside, it's hard to argue with Bread and Circuses. It's not game changing, but Saigon's fanbase will love it, and sometimes it's better to stick with what you know.\" Amanda Bassa of HipHopDX gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying \"In true Sai-giddy fashion, he leaves his audience with some of his own lessons that he has learned in life. Rather than sounding preachy, he succeeds in leaving the impression that he simply wants other people to listen, understand, and take notes in hopes that children like his daughter won’t have to grow up in such a volatile environment (word to \"Crazy World\"). “Stocking Cap” Sai may be no more, but Saigon proves that he still hasn’t lost his touch on the mic.\" \n\nChristopher Minaya of \"XXL\" gave the album an XL, saying \"In short, Saigon’s second LP offers a sizable amount of diversity over fitting instrumentals, exhibiting how much he has evolved as a rapper by personifying his bars to reflect his music and his life. The album is gratifying, surely enough to make those whom purchase the album to be happy with what they paid for.\" Steve Juon of RapReviews gave the album an eight out of ten, saying \"As a sequel to \"The Greatest Story Never Told\" some people will feel that it's not as good as the original, but as for this reviewer Saigon is still that dude who has something to say that's worth hearing.\" David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album four outr of five stars, saying \"Still, the beats are as varied and well selected as the guest list which counts Styles P, Chamillionaire, Marsha Ambrosius, and Lecrae amongst its most desirable guest shots. A couple more albums this rich and Saigon might actually save the game, begging the question: then what will he rap about?\"\n\nThe album debuted at number 151 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, with first-week sales of 2,800 copies in the United States.\n"}

His prototype is found everywhere in America, but is most closely identified with the tall corn and cotton country. He has been called by some the most enduring theatrical figure in the American theatre.\n\nToby Tolliver is a rube in the grand tradition. His hair is bright as a fire truck, and he usually wears overalls that are likely as not held up by one strap. He speaks a low brand of English, and many cultivated customs of society are beyond him.\nUnderneath Toby's country appearance and unsophisticated manner, there runs deep currents of native wit, of cunning and resourcefulness. Unlike many rubes before him, Toby is True Blue. Sometimes he actually rises to the heroic, though invariably he makes it appear accidental.\n\nToby is awkward, unlettered, boisterous, full of fun, with a great amount of common sense. He is the fellow in the play who says what the man in the audience wishes he could have thought of. Toby has been a show business character for a long time - some say since Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" first hit the \"boards\". For thirty-eight years, Toby and his counterpart Susie were the chief asset for Neil and Caroline, the Schaffner Players.

Before that, on December 24, 1949, it transmitted Pope Pius XII's message at Christmas and at the beginning of the Jubilee year in Belarusian. Roman Catholic priest Piotr Tatarynovich was the first editor-in-chief and for a long time the only staff member of the Belarusian Service.\n\nOriginally the programs were broadcast on a weekly basis and contained news from the Vatican, information on the Catholic church and the Belarusian diaspora, as well as catechesal and apologetic reflections. Later Fr. Kastus Maskalik joined the Service working mainly as an announcer. Bishop Ceslau Sipovich, Fr. Tamash Padzyava and some other Belarusian Catholic immigrants collaborated with the Service. After his retirement in 1970 Fr. Tatarynovich lived in Rome and was involved in publishing and translation activities.\n\nLeu Garoshka, a Greek-Catholic priest, was in charge of the Vatican Radio's Belarusian Service from 1970 to 1977. By then, the number of programs had increased to five editions a week. Each edition lasted 14 minutes. Apart from the Vatican news, Fr. Garoshka focused on apologetic and Belarusian national themes. He developed a series of programmes on Christian aspects in the Belarusian literature, the history of Christianity in Belarus, Belarusian religious figures and arguments for the existence of God by famous personalities, such as scientists, astronomers, composers.\n\nAfter Fr. Garoshka's death in 1977, the Service was headed by Fr. Robert Tamushansky. For the first time the staff included not only priests but also secular believers. In 1980, Pope John Paul II visited the Belarusian Service during his visit to the Vatican Radio. From 1988 to 1993, the Service produced a monthly newsletter on Christian and Belarusian national themes which was distributed by mail among Belarusian immigrants and believers. Live commentaries of solemn Vatican events were broadcast in the Belarusian language. With the opening of borders, the office of the Belarusian Service was visited by the Belarusian Catholic hierarchies, public and cultural figures: Vasyl Bykau, Rygor Baradulin, Anatol Hrytskevich, Adam Maldzis, Janka Zaprudnik, Vitaut Kipel, Fr. Jan Matusevich, Fr. Alexander Nadson, cardinal Kazimir Svyontek and others.\n\nIn 1996, Belgian Jesuit Fr. Claude Robinet took charge. Contacts with the Belarusian Catholic Church increased during that period. Local correspondents started to send reports. The official website was launched.\n\nStarting from 2010, the Belarusian Service was directed by Fr. Aliaksandr Amialchenia. During this period changes brought the Service up to modern broadcasting standards. In particular, the program structure was changed, focusing on relevance, timeliness and ease of comprehension. In April 2011, the Belarusian Service launched an Official Facebook page.

It took place on November 2, 2018, at King Saud University Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The event hosted the first-ever WWE World Cup tournament \"to determine the best in the world\". It also marked the in-ring return of Shawn Michaels, who retired in 2010, as well as the return of Hulk Hogan—who had not appeared on WWE television since a 2015 scandal—who served as the event's host.\n\nThe card comprised of twelve matches, including one on the pre-show. In the main event, D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) defeated The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane). In the penultimate match, Shane McMahon defeated Dolph Ziggler to win the WWE World Cup after replacing The Miz, who was ruled unable to compete after originally qualifying for the final. In other prominent matches, The Bar defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The New Day, AJ Styles defeated Samoa Joe to retain the WWE Championship, and Brock Lesnar defeated Braun Strowman to win the vacant WWE Universal Championship for a record second time.\n\nDue to the controversy surrounding the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, WWE faced harsh criticism for continuing on with the event despite the killing and was asked to stop its business ventures in Saudi Arabia by multiple parties. The controversy also led to the company's top babyfaces, John Cena and Daniel Bryan, boycotting the show. The event itself was negatively received, in particular due to the Universal Title bout and the World Cup final.\n\nOn March 5, 2018, WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority announced the Greatest Royal Rumble, a live event to be held on April 27, 2018 at the King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. On September 17, 2018, WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority announced the follow up to the Greatest Royal Rumble, Crown Jewel, a live event to be held on November 2, 2018 at the King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh. The events are part of a 10-year strategic multiplatform partnership between WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority in support of Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia’s social and economic reform program. On October 6, 2018, it was announced that the venue for Crown Jewel was changed from the King Fahd International Stadium to the King Saud University Stadium.\n\nIn 2015, the WWE terminated Hulk Hogan's contract due to a report by the \"National Enquirer\" and Radar Online of an anti-black rant made by Hogan on his controversial leaked sex tape in which he was heard expressing disgust with the notion of his daughter dating black men, referenced by the repeated use of the racial slur \"nigger\". On July 15, 2018, after a three-year suspension, the company reinstated Hogan into the WWE Hall of Fame, and on October 31, it was announced that Hogan would be the host of Crown Jewel.\n\nThe card consisted of twelve matches, including one on the pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands. Storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"SmackDown Live.\"\n\nAt SummerSlam, Brock Lesnar defended the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns. Before the match began, Braun Strowman came out and announced that he would be cashing in his Money in the Bank contract on the winner. During the match, however, Strowman was incapacitated by Lesnar, preventing him from cashing in. The distraction allowed Reigns to defeat Lesnar and win the championship, ending Lesnar's 504-day reign. The following night on \"Raw,\" General Manager Kurt Angle told Lesnar's advocate Paul Heyman that although Lesnar had a contractual rematch, it would not occur for an indefinite period of time. The following week, Strowman announced that he would be cashing in against Reigns at Hell in a Cell inside the namesake structure. At the event, Lesnar interfered in the match by kicking in the cell door and attacking both men, rendering them unable to continue, thus ruling the match a no contest and Reigns retained the championship. The following night on \"Raw,\" both Reigns and Strowman called out Lesnar, resulting in Acting General Manager Baron Corbin scheduling a triple threat match between Reigns, Strowman, and Lesnar for the Universal Championship at Crown Jewel. On the October 22 episode of \"Raw\", however, Reigns relinquished the title after announcing that his leukemia, which had been in remission since late 2008, had legitimately relapsed. This turned the scheduled triple threat match into a singles match between Lesnar and Strowman for the now vacant title.\n\nOn September 17, 2018, WWE scheduled the WWE World Cup for Crown Jewel, an eight-man tournament to \"determine the best in the world\" with four wrestlers representing Raw and SmackDown each. On the October 8 episode of \"Raw\", for his accomplishments in WWE, free agent John Cena was announced as the first entrant to represent Raw. That same episode, a 10-man \"global\" battle royal commenced where the winner would be added to the tournament. Acting General Manager Baron Corbin took part with nine local competitors, but was lastly eliminated by a returning Kurt Angle, disguised as The Conquistador, thus Angle won the battle royal to qualify for the tournament. Two more qualifiers were decided on the October 9 episode of \"SmackDown\", where Jeff Hardy and Randy Orton qualified for the tournament by defeating Samoa Joe and Big Show, respectively. Raw's final two qualifiers were decided on the October 15 episode of \"Raw\", where Seth Rollins and Dolph Ziggler qualified by defeating Drew McIntyre and Dean Ambrose, respectively. SmackDown's final two qualifiers were decided on the \"SmackDown 1000\" special, where The Miz and Rey Mysterio, the latter making his full-time WWE return, qualified for the tournament by defeating Rusev and Shinsuke Nakamura, respectively. On the October 29 episode of \"Raw\", Acting General Manager Baron Corbin replaced Cena with Bobby Lashley after praising Lashley's post-match beat down of Finn Bálor earlier that night. In storyline, Corbin replaced Cena as he did not technically qualify for the tournament. In reality, Cena legitimately refused to participate due to the controversy surrounding the event. On the October 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon gave his four participants an ultimatum: if their finalist were to lose, they would be fired from SmackDown.\n\nAt Super Show-Down, AJ Styles defeated Samoa Joe by submission in a no countout, no disqualification match to retain the WWE Championship. On the same night, Daniel Bryan defeated The Miz to earn a WWE Championship match. Following Bryan's win, it was announced by SmackDown General Manager Paige that he would receive his WWE Championship match against Styles at Crown Jewel. However, after the two had a heated exchange on the October 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", Commissioner Shane McMahon announced that their championship match would take place that night. Styles successfully retained his championship after submitting Bryan with the \"Calf Crusher\". Moments after the match concluded, Joe attacked both men, choking each out with the \"Coquina Clutch\". Enraged, Styles demanded to face Joe at Crown Jewel with the title on the line, and Paige reluctantly made it official. In reality, Bryan had also legitimately refused to work Crown Jewel due to the controversy surrounding the event, so WWE moved his championship match up to the October 30 episode of \"SmackDown\".\n\nAt Super Show-Down, Triple H defeated The Undertaker in a No Disqualification match. After the match, Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, and Kane showed mutual respect for one another until Undertaker and Kane attacked Triple H and Michaels. On the following \"Raw\", Triple H and Michaels formally rechristened themselves as D-Generation X, challenging The Brothers of Destruction to a tag team match at Crown Jewel, marking Michaels' first match since being retired by The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXVI in 2010.\n\nOn the \"SmackDown 1000\" special on October 16, 2018, The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus) defeated The New Day (represented by Big E and Xavier Woods) to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, with help from their new ally Big Show. A rematch for the titles was scheduled for Crown Jewel.\n\nOn November 1, it was announced that Shinsuke Nakamura would defend the United States Championship against Rusev on the event's pre-show.\n\nDuring the pre-show, Shinsuke Nakamura defended the United States Championship against Rusev. In the climax, following a low blow, Nakamura performed the \"Kinshasa\" on Rusev to retain the title.\n\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with host Hulk Hogan hyping up the crowd for the event.\n\nIn the first match, Rey Mysterio faced Randy Orton in SmackDown's first WWE World Cup quarterfinal match. During the match, Orton attempted to remove Mysterio's mask. Orton countered a \"619\" atttempt from Mysterio into a DDT. In the end, Mysterio countered an \"RKO\" attempt into a roll-up to win the match and advance to the semi-finals. After the match, Orton attacked Mysterio with an \"RKO\" and threw Mysterio on top of the Arabic announce table.\n\nNext, The Miz faced Jeff Hardy in SmackDown's second WWE World Cup quarterfinal match. Hardy performed a \"Whisper in the Wind\" on Miz for a near fall. In the climax, Miz countered a \"Twist of Fate\" and performed the \"Skull Crushing Finale\" on Hardy to win the match and advance to the semi-finals.\n\nAfter that, Seth Rollins faced Bobby Lashley (with Lio Rush) in Raw's first WWE World Cup quarterfinal match. In the end, Rollins performed \"Тhe Stomp\" on Lashley to win the match and advance to the semi-finals.\n\nIn the fourth match, Kurt Angle faced Dolph Ziggler (with Drew McIntyre) in Raw's second and the final WWE World Cup quarterfinal match. Angle performed a trio of suplexes on Ziggler for a nearfall. Ziggler performed a DDT on Angle for a nearfall. Angle performed an \"Angle Slam\" on Ziggler for a nearfall. Ziggler performed a \"Famouser\" on Angle for a nearfall. Angle applied the ankle lock on Ziggler, however, Ziggler countered. In the climax, Ziggler performed a \"Zig-Zag\" on Angle to win the match and advance to the semi-final.\n\nNext, The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus) (with Big Show) defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston) (with Xavier Woods). In the end, Sheamus countered a \"Big Ending\" from Big E and shoved Big E into Big Show, who was standing on the ring apron. Whilst the referee was distracted, Show performed a \"Knockout Punch\" on Big E and Sheamus performed a \"Brogue Kick\" on Big E to retain the title.\n\nAfter that, The Miz faced Rey Mysterio in SmackDown's WWE World Cup semi-final match. Miz performed the \"Skull Crushing Finale\" on Mysterio for a nearfall. Mysterio performed the \"619\" on Miz. In the end, Miz countered a splash from Mysterio into a roll-up for the win to earn a spot in the finals.\n\nNext, Seth Rollins faced Dolph Ziggler (with Drew McIntyre) in Raw's WWE World Cup semi-final match. Rollins and Ziggler exchanged a number of roll-ups for nearfalls. Rollins performed a \"Rip Cord Knee\" on Ziggler for a nearfall. Rollins performed a suicide dive on Ziggler. Ziggler performed a \"Famouser\" on Rollins for a nearfall. Ziggler countered a \"Falcon Arrow\" into a \"Zig-Zag\" on Rollins for a nearfall. In the end, as Rollins attempted a splash on Ziggler, McIntyre pushed Rollins and Ziggler performed a Superkick on Rollins to win the match to advance to the finals. After the match, Byron Saxton interviewed Ziggler where he vowed to win the WWE World Cup.\n\nIn the ninth match, AJ Styles defended the WWE Championship against Samoa Joe. Joe dominated Styles early in the match and began to target Styles' knee. Joe performed a suicide dive on Styles outside the ring. In the end, Styles performed a \"Phenomenal Forearm\" on Joe to retain the title.\n\nAfter that, Braun Strowman faced Brock Lesnar (with Paul Heyman) for the vacant Universal Championship. Acting General Manager Baron Corbin came out to present the title to the winner. Before the match began, Corbin attacked Strowman with the title. Lesnar attacked Strowman with three \"F-5s\", however, all three resulted in nearfalls. Lesnar performed another \"F-5\" on Strowman, but to the outside of the ring, forcing Strowman to beat a countout. In the end, Lesnar performed a fifth \"F-5\" on Strowman to regain the title. With this win, Lesnar became the first two-time Universal Champion.\n\nIn the penultimate match, The Miz was originally supposed to face Dolph Ziggler (with Drew McIntyre) in the finals of the WWE World Cup. McIntyre was immediately ejected at ringside. As McIntyre headed to the back, Miz attacked Ziggler before the bell and threw him outside the ring. As Miz exited the ring, he tweaked his leg (kayfabe), which led to him unable to compete. This led to SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon taking Miz's place in the match. As the match officially began, McMahon attacked Ziggler, however, Acting Raw General Manager Baron Corbin interfered only to get ejected himself. Ziggler performed a \"Zig-Zag\" on McMahon for a nearfall. In the end, McMahon performed a \"Coast to Coast\" on Ziggler to win the match and the WWE World Cup, and celebrated throughout the arena with the trophy.\n\nIn the main event, D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) faced The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) in Michaels' first match since 2010, as well as the first time that the two tag teams ever faced each other in a tag team match. During the match, all four men brawled, leading to outside the ring where Kane put Triple H through an announce table. Michaels performed a moonsault from the top rope on Undertaker and Kane outside the ring. The end came when Michaels performed \"Sweet Chin Music\" on Kane, followed by a \"Pedigree\" from Triple H, who pinned Kane to win the match. During the match, Triple H was legitimately injured, suffering a torn pectoral muscle.\n\nAfter his interference in the WWE Universal Championship title match, Braun Strowman sought revenge against Baron Corbin. After chasing him through the arena during the next \"Raw\" episode, Stephanie McMahon struck a bargain with him a week later: if he ceased attacking Corbin until after 2018 Survivor Series and led \"Team Raw\" to victory, he would be granted a match against Corbin and another Universal Championship title match against Brock Lesnar, and could freely determine the stipulations in either match.<ref name=\"11/5 Raw\"></ref><ref name=\"11/12 Raw\"></ref> At Survivor Series, Strowman eliminated 4 of the 5 members of \"Team Smackdown\" and led his team to a decisive victory. On the following \"Raw\", he was granted his match against Corbin at , which he stipulated to be a namesake match. If Strowman wins, he is granted another Universal title match against Brock Lesnar at the 2019 Royal Rumble and Corbin loses all authority. If Corbin, on the other hand, is successful, he will become the permanent General Manager of \"Raw\" and Strowman will not face Lesnar.\n\nThe involvement of Shane McMahon in the WWE World Cup final was used a build-up towards Survivor Series. It drew heavy criticism from various wrestlers on the \"Raw\" roster. Acting General Manager Baron Corbin accused McMahon of stealing the World Cup from \"Raw\" and of having massively abused his power. The same statements were reiterated by Dolph Ziggler, who called McMahon's actions a conspiracy, and his partner Drew McIntyre. Both wrestlers proclaimed Ziggler to be the \"true best in the world\". Furthermore, Stephanie McMahon called her brother's actions \"an insult to the entire \"Raw\" locker room\" and urged Braun Strownman to rectify this wrong by leading \"Team Raw\" to victory at Survivor Series. On the \"Smackdown Live\" episode following Crown Jewel, general manager Paige announced Shane McMahon as the \"best in the world\", drawing a negative crowd reaction. McMahon admitted that he is indeed not the best wrestler in the world, but saw it as his duty as the commissioner of \"Smackdown Live\" to assure that his brand won the WWE World Cup. As The Miz had originally qualified for the final, he took credit for McMahon's victory and subsequently demanded to captain \"Team Smackdown\", to which McMahon and Paige obliged, naming him co-captain along with Daniel Bryan. Bryan and Miz then named McMahon as part of \"Team Smackdown\" on the grounds of him winning the WWE World Cup. During the men's Survivor Series match, McMahon eliminated Ziggler, who kept on referring to himself as the \"best in the world\", but could not help his team overcome Braun Strowman, who almost single-handedly eliminated most of his team. Altogether, \"Smackdown Live\" suffered a clean sweep on the pay-per-view, only winning the tag team match on the pre-show.\n\nFurthermore, the Miz tried to convince Shane McMahon to form a tag team, again painting McMahon's win at the WWE World Cup as a team effort. However, their tag team, branded by Miz as \"The Best Team in the World\", lost its debut match to a duo of local competitors after a roll-up to Miz.\n\nAs had already been the case with their previous show in Saudi Arabia, Greatest Royal Rumble, WWE came under scrutiny for catering to a state accused of severe human rights abuses, leading a war of attrition in Yemen and suppressing women's rights. \n\nDue to restrictions on women under Islamic law in Saudi Arabia, women have not been allowed to perform at WWE's events in Saudi Arabia, although female performer Renee Young did provide commentary at Crown Jewel. Prior to the announcement of Crown Jewel, WWE announced its first-ever all-women's pay-per-view event, WWE Evolution, which took place on October 28, 2018. Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque, WWE's Executive Vice President of Talent, Live Events and Creative, denied that Evolution was intended to be a counterpoint for the all-male Saudi Arabia events, explaining that WWE's female performers \"deserve[d] the opportunity\" for such a showcase, and that it \"was simply the right time for this to happen.\"\n\nIn wake of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi agents, WWE has faced calls to cancel the event, with prominent U.S. Democratic and Republican politicians criticizing the company's endeavors in Saudi Arabia. Questions were raised whether because of the position of Administrator of the Small Business Administration Linda McMahon, who is the wife of WWE CEO Vince McMahon and a former WWE executive herself, WWE's endeavors in Saudi Arabia could still be viewed as a strictly private business enterprise. Due to this, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez urged the US government to pressure WWE into canceling the event, while Republican Lindsey Graham, among others, called for WWE to reconsider their business deal with the Saudi kingdom. English comedian and political commentator John Oliver also weighed in on the controversy on his show \"Last Week Tonight\", criticizing WWE for what he saw as blatant pro-Saudi propaganda. \n\nKnox County Mayor and professional wrestler Glenn \"Kane\" Jacobs, who was scheduled to compete in a tag team match, announced he would work at the event, contrasting reports that the majority of WWE's wrestlers felt uncomfortable working the show. Former WWE wrestler John Layfield spoke on Fox News in favor of the event in order to promote change, while current WWE wrestlers Randy Orton, Ronda Rousey and Mark Henry had similar remarks when speaking with TMZ. On the other hand, John Cena, who was scheduled to participate in the WWE World Cup and had called it \"an honor and a privilege\" to compete in Saudi Arabia during the Greatest Royal Rumble, was replaced by Bobby Lashley, as he reportedly refused to work the show in wake of the Khashoggi murder. Daniel Bryan, who was scheduled to face AJ Styles for the WWE Championship, had his title match bumped up to the October 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", and was replaced on the Crown Jewel card by Samoa Joe, as he too reportedly refused to work the show. \n\nWWE continued to promote the show, but erased all references to Saudi Arabia as the event's location. On October 19, the day tickets were to go on sale, the Saudi government confirmed the death of Khashoggi within the consulate and WWE.com removed ticket information from the event page. On October 25, WWE confirmed the event would go on as planned, citing contractual obligations to the General Sports Authority. Speaking with Sky Sports on pushing forward with the event despite the murder, WWE CBO Stephanie McMahon spoke of \"an incredibly tough decision, given that heinous act\", but said that in the end it was strictly a business decision.\n\nThe show received generally negative to mixed reviews from critics. The conclusions to the World Cup tournament and Universal Championship match in particular received severe criticism.\n\nCBS Sports' Adam Silverstein and Jack Jorgensen gave the event a \"C-\" rating, describing that the show \"failed as a normal event but at least had enough to talk about afterward\", while finding the booking and WWE's long-term plans questionable. The Universal Championship match received a \"D+\" rating, with Lesnar's \"surprise\" win being listed as a positive but being wholly outweighed by \"no offense from Strowman\". Five matches received a \"C+\" rating, including the Styles-Joe WWE Championship match for being \"relatively slow\", the WWE World Cup Final for being \"creative though a bit confounding\", and the main event tag match between DX and the Brothers of Destruction, which offered \"effort and nostalgia ... but not much more\" given the wrestlers' age resulting in them \"operating at 50 percent of their prior capacity\".\n\nBryan Rose of the \"Wrestling Observer\" described Crown Jewel as a show that ended \"mercifully\" after a \"very plodding, long\" main event. Despite this, Rose noted that the tag team main event was better than the main event at Super Show-Down. Of the WWE World Cup matches and the SmackDown tag title match, most were \"paint by numbers\" or \"nothing special\", with only Ziggler-Angle \"decent\" and Ziggler-Rollins \"pretty good\". Meanwhile, the matches of Ziggler-McMahon and Lesnar-Strowman \"couldn't be more destructive towards people that need a boost the most\", while a \"McMahon winning [the WWE World Cup], which was to crown the best in the world, feels like an allegory for something.\" Lastly, Styles-Joe \"was good while it lasted, but they’ve had better matches.\"\n\nJason Powell of \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\", who viewed the event as a \"cash grab\" by WWE, wrote that \"Crown Jewel was gross for all the obvious reasons, including Vince McMahon doubling down on the controversy by bringing back Hulk Hogan.\" For the main event tag match, Powell wrote that despite their efforts, \"everyone involved came up short regardless of how much gushing the broadcast team did afterward\", and the four veterans were instead \"stealing the spotlight from the deserving full-time stars of yet another generation\". Powell felt that all the WWE World Cup tournament matches were \"basic and brief\", and that Shane McMahon (for some reason Powell could not understand) had become \"yet another heel authority figure\" in WWE. Powell did manage to find a few positives with the show, including the decision not to rush into giving Strowman a world title and a \"quality Kickoff Show match\" between Rusev and Nakamura.\n\nThe WWE World Cup was an eight-man single elimination tournament to determine the \"best in the world\". Four participants came from Raw and four participants came from SmackDown. Participants from Raw and SmackDown faced opponents of their own brand until one member of their brand was left, after which, the finalist from Raw faced the finalist from SmackDown. John Cena was originally announced as a direct participant on account of his previous achievements in WWE, but was replaced by Bobby Lashley after he legitimately refused to work the show in wake of the Khashoggi incident.\n\n"}
