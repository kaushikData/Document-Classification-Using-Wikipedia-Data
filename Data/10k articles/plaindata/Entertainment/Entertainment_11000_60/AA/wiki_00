{"id": "1148117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1148117", "title": "Comic book death", "text": "Comic book death\n\nIn the comic book fan community, the apparent death and subsequent return of a long-running character is often called a comic book death. A comic book death is generally not taken seriously by readers and is rarely permanent or meaningful other than for story or thematic purposes.\n\nCommenting on the impact and role of comic book character deaths, writer Geoff Johns said:\n\nThe phenomenon of comic book death is particularly common for superhero characters. Writer Danny Fingeroth suggests that the nature of superheroes requires that they be both ageless and immortal.\n\nA common expression regarding comic book death was once \"The only people who stay dead in comics are Bucky, Jason Todd, and Uncle Ben,\" referring to the seminal importance of those characters' deaths to the title character: Captain America's sidekick (retconned dead in 1964), Batman's second Robin (dead in 1988), and Spider-Man's uncle (dead since 1962), respectively. This long-held tenet was broken in 2005, when Jason Todd returned to life as the Red Hood and Bucky was reported to have survived the accident that seemingly killed him, brought back in 2005 as the Winter Soldier, remaining in the shadows for decades. Barnes apparently died again in 2011 after a short tenure as Captain America, only to be revived by Nick Fury's Infinity Formula.\n\nBecause death in comics is so often temporary, readers rarely take the death of a character seriously—when a character dies, the reader feels very little sense of loss, and simply left wondering how long it will be before they return to life.\n\nAlthough several comic book deaths are well-known, two of the best-known are the 1980 \"death\" of Jean Grey in Marvel's \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" and that of Superman in DC's highly publicized 1993 \"Death of Superman\" storyline. There is one major distinction between the two, however—whereas it was never intended that Superman's death be permanent, but rather that he would return to life at the conclusion of the story, Jean's passing was intended to be permanent, as the editor Jim Shooter felt that would be the only satisfactory outcome given that she had committed mass murder. Despite this, the story was retconned a few years later to facilitate Jean's return.\n\nIn 2007, the death of Captain America made real-world headlines when he met his apparent end, but Steve Rogers returned in \"\" in late 2009.\n\nComic book characters themselves have made comments about the frequency of resurrections. Professor X has commented \"in mutant heaven there are no pearly gates, but instead revolving doors.\" When Siryn was made aware of her father's death, she refused to mourn him, giddily claiming that since her father has died as an X-Man, he was likely going to be soon resurrected, shocking her friends. Her father is later restored to life but is recruited by the Apocalypse Twins as part of their new Horsemen of Apocalypse. The obituary writer of the in-universe newspaper the \"Daily Bugle\" once bemoaned to reporter Ben Urich about how many retractions he has had to write after each resurrection of a superhero or supervillain.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9802783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9802783", "title": "Cupid and Death", "text": "Cupid and Death\n\nCupid and Death is a mid-seventeenth-century masque, written by the Caroline era dramatist James Shirley, and performed on 26 March 1653 before the Portuguese ambassador to Great Britain. The work and its performance provide a point of contradiction to the standard view that the England of Oliver Cromwell and the Interregnum was uniformly hostile to stage drama.\n\nAfter the closure of the theatres in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War, Shirley earned a living as a schoolteacher. As part of his new occupation, he wrote dramas — morality plays and masques — for his students to perform. The final works of his career, including \"Honoria and Mammon\" and \"The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses\" (both published in 1659), were works for student performers. \"Cupid and Death\" is another work in this category, though its resemblances with the great masques of the late Stuart Court have been noted by critics — it \"is much more like a Court Masque than any of Shirley's other school Masques\". Perhaps this aspect of the work made it seem appropriate for the Portuguese ambassador, the Count of Peneguiaõ. Shirley's past Royalist connections with the Stuart Court, and even his Roman Catholicism, clearly (if surprisingly) did not stand as insuperable obstacles to a public staging of the work.\n\n\"Cupid and Death\" was first published in quarto in 1653, by the booksellers John Crook and John Baker. It was reprinted in 1659. The full musical score for the masque, by Matthew Locke and Christopher Gibbons, has survived, and was published together with Shirley's text in a modern edition in 1951.\n\nThe drama depends on a traditional tale, found in Aesop and many subsequent versions. For his source, Shirley employed a 1651 translation of Aesop by John Ogilby, with whom he'd worked at the Werburgh Street Theatre in the later 1630s. Shirley wrote commendatory verses for Ogilby's volume.\n\nIn the tale and in Shirley's retelling, Death and Cupid accidentally exchange their arrows and cause chaos as a result. Cupid shoots potential lovers and inadvertently kills them. Death shoots at elderly people whose time of passing has come, and strikes them ardent instead; he shoots duellists about to fight, and they drop their swords to embrace and dance and sing. The \"serious\" portion of the masque features the kind of personifications standard in the masque form: Nature, Folly, Madness, and Despair. As usual in masques of Shirley's era, the work contains a comic anti-masque, with a tavern Host and a Chamberlain, and a dance of \"Satyrs and Apes.\" (The poor Chamberlain is struck by Death with Cupid's arrow, and falls in love with an ape.) The god Mercury eventually intervenes to set things right; Cupid is banished from the courts of princes to common people's cottages (a suitably sober moral for the Puritan regime then in power). The slain lovers are shown rejoicing in Elysium.\n\n\"\"Cupid and Death\" resembles Caroline masque in its use of staging, music, dance, singing and dialogue. Yet it differs in that the masquers take part in the action and they do not dance with the audience at the end...The balance between spoken prose dialogue, recitative and song carries the performance away from masque and towards opera, a form Davenant planned to introduce to the London stage as early as 1639.\"\n\n\"Cupid and Death\" was performed at Rutland Boughton's Glastonbury Festival in 1919, by the Consorte of Musicke (notably Anthony Rooley and Emma Kirkby) in 1985, and by the Halastó Kórus (directed by Göttinger Pál) in Budapest in 2008.\n\n"}
{"id": "33805228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33805228", "title": "Efsi Toys", "text": "Efsi Toys\n\nEfsi was a Dutch company making diecast cars and trucks starting in 1959 under the Bestbox name. The company could be considered the Matchbox Toys of the Netherlands, but its origins and purpose as a government sponsored employer was far less commercial than other toy manufacturers. Efsi was based in Heerlen, the Netherlands, which is located in southern Limburg province.\n\nIn 1959 (some sources say 1962), Bestbox started making simple diecast cars in Limburg province (Bickford 2009). The Dutch Wiki site reports that in the 1960s, the coal mines in Limburg closed. Some significant post-mining industries where workers relocated were automobile producers DAF and Nedcar in Born. After the closure, DSM (The Dutch State Mines) tried providing new employment to out-of-work or disabled miners in different shops or factories. These 'WIM' workshops (Workshop for Disabled Miners) were backed by a national Fund for Social Institutions (FSI). \n\nOne of the activities was to continue the production of Best-box models. Later the name was changed to EFSI, apparently a phonetic pronunciation of FSI (EFSI Dutch Wiki page; see also EFSI Made in Holland, 2010–2011). The Bestbox name was discontinued in 1971, perhaps because of the similarity to the name (and competition) of Matchbox toys (Breithaupt 2001). Though similar to Matchbox, and popular locally, Efsi toys do not seem to have been too well known outside the Netherlands (Rixon 2005, p. 85). Most Efsi products were marked \"Made in Holland\" (as opposed to 'Made in the Netherlands') on the base.\n\nAmong EFSI's first vehicles were a set of 1960s Formula One cars including Ferrari, Brabham, Honda, Lotus, and Cooper Maserati (Breithaupt 2001; Rixon 2005, p. 85). These were first marketed under the Best Box name and had realistic engines, thick black tires and realistic, solid appearing, deep-set wheels. Several other vehicles were also marketed under the Best Box label, like a Citroen Dyan sedan. Another popular line were a very Matchbox-like series of diecast bodied Ford Model T vehicles in various forms including coupe, sedan, pickup, delivery van, delivery van in fire engine livery (with ladder), tanker, and wrecker truck. Some Model T versions had diecast bases, but plastic bodies. Overall, these were simple but attractive models, produced since the Best Box days, then later cast with the Efsi name up to about 1980 or beyond. The Model T delivery van was made in several liveries like Harrod's, Cadbury, and George Travis wholesale confectioner. Even later, many Efsi vehicles were closely duplicated by Spain's Auto Pilen (Bras 2012a; Bras 2012b; Breithaupt 2001).\n\nOther cars, like a Jaguar XKE convertible, BMW coupe, and a Citroën DS ambulance were also made. Many EFSI cars were a bit smaller than those made by Matchbox and some dies seemed very close to Matchbox - like the Mercedes-Benz 280 convertible and a Mercedes-Benz flat bed truck. One earlier Ford Transit van casting appears similar to one made by Zylmex around 1990, so EFSI appears to have participated in the common practice of buying tooling and also selling it to companies in other countries.\n\nMany Efsi dies were made by a company in Portugal, though models themselves were made in the Netherlands (Efsi-toys 2006). In the 1980s, EFSI became known for its HO scale truck and bus lines. Early trucks were Dutch DAFs but a Mercedes-Benz cab (long and short wheelbase) and a Commer van were also common (Bickford 2009; Rixon 2005, p. 97). Varied liveries were seen, often of Dutch or mainland European products like Philips, KLM airlines, Miele appliances, Intertrans Freight Logistics, and Libeltex nonwoven materials (EFSI Made in Holland, 2010–2011; Johnson 1998, pp. 65–66; Rixon 2005, p. 97). Other international companies like Exxon Escorenes, Pirelli, Hurlimann Beer, Chiquita Bananas, and Safeway Foods were also done. One truck, a FIAT van with sliding side door was often seen with automobile ads (FIAT or Citroen) or with Police or 'Gendarmerie', according to language. Just as often, though, trucks were produced clean, without any livery at all. One bus, a Bova Futura, was made in at least 15 different liveries.\n\nEarly trucks were produced with a basic unadorned black wheel design, while later ones incorporated a triangular chrome wheel that looked a lot like a Majorette design. Packaging in the 1980s was simple as trucks were held in flimsy plastic containers with an EFSI identification sticker on the lower side of the container. Later, more design and color was incorporated on a cardboard blister, but, still, the presentation was simpler than more developed diecast companies - no printing was usually seen on the back of the blister card. One interesting aspect of packaging was the eight sided STOP sign in red seen on the blister packages for EFSI Toys. The sign, which says \"code\" right next to it, seems to be a warning that the toy is unsafe for children under a certain age. Most EFSI toys were stamped 'Holland' or 'Made in Holland'. Blister packs for smaller trucks and cars were variously marked as Efsi RevWheels, Efsi Toppers, or Efsi Plus (Bras 2012a).\n\nAround 1988, apparently when the disabled miner program was discontinued, the company name was changed to Holland Oto, which is still in operation, making contemporary models of trucks, buses, and agricultural vehicles (Bickford 2009, Holland-Oto Miniaturen 2010). Today, Holland-Oto is headquartered in Weert, just southeast of Eindhoven, but north of the Heerlen home of the former Efsi establishment in Limburg. While earlier Efsi packaging was either white or yellow or some combination of the two, the Holland Oto vehicles were generally the same products, but now in a blue and orange package (Bras 2012a).\n\nHolland Oto had connections with Dutch AHC, and thus today has connections to the JOAL and Pilen enterprises in Spain (Breithaupt 2001). For example, in 1980, Pilen S.A. introduced new vehicles. These were the former Model Ts rebadged and some of the typical Efsi HO trucks - though re-engineered by Pilen with that company's considerable talent for diecast refinement (Bras 2012b).

Such celebrations have been held for over a century, but the specific term \"Evolution Day\" for the anniversary appears to be a neologism which was coined prior to 1997. By highlighting Darwin's contributions to science, the day's events are used to educate about evolutionary biology. It is similar to the better-known Darwin Day, held on the anniversary of his birth (12 February 1809). It is unrelated to the secularization campaign by the Giordano Bruno Foundation to have the German public holiday of Ascension Day renamed to \"Evolutionstag\" (Evolution Day).\n\n1909, the 50th anniversary of the publication of \"On The Origin of Species\" and the 100th anniversary of Darwin's birth, saw several major events celebrating both. At Cambridge, more than 400 scientists and dignitaries from 167 countries met in a widely reported event of public interest to honour Darwin's contributions and discuss the latest discoveries and ideas related to evolution, the New York Academy of Sciences held a celebration at the American Museum of Natural History,\nand the Royal Society of New Zealand held an event with \"a very large attendance.\"\n\nThe Darwin Centennial Celebration (1959) had a major, well publicised event from 24–28 November at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn 2009, the BBC aired BBC Darwin Season, a series of television and radio programs, to celebrate Darwin's bicentenary and the 150th anniversary of the publication of \"the Origin\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35166850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35166850", "title": "Fifty Shades of Grey", "text": "Fifty Shades of Grey\n\nFifty Shades of Grey is a 2011 erotic romance novel by British author E. L. James. It is the first instalment in the \"Fifty Shades\" trilogy that traces the deepening relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia Steele, and a young business magnate, Christian Grey. It is notable for its explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of sexual practices involving bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, and sadism/masochism (BDSM). Originally self-published as an ebook and a print-on-demand, publishing rights were acquired by Vintage Books in March 2012.\n\n\"Fifty Shades of Grey\" has topped best-seller lists around the world, selling over 125 million copies worldwide by June 2015. It has been translated into 52 languages, and set a record in the United Kingdom as the fastest-selling paperback of all time. Critical reception of the book, however, has tended towards the negative, with the quality of its prose generally seen as poor. Universal Pictures and Focus Features produced a film adaptation, which was released on 13 February 2015 and also received generally unfavourable reviews.\n\nThe second and third volumes of the trilogy, \"Fifty Shades Darker\" and \"Fifty Shades Freed\", were published in 2012. \"\", a version of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" being told from Christian's point of view, was published in June 2015.\n\nAnastasia \"Ana\" Steele is a 21-year-old college senior attending Washington State University in Vancouver, Washington. Her best friend is Katherine \"Kate\" Kavanagh, who writes for the college newspaper. Due to an illness, Kate is unable to interview 27-year-old Christian Grey, a successful and wealthy Seattle entrepreneur, and asks Ana to take her place. Ana finds Christian attractive as well as intimidating. As a result, she stumbles through the interview and leaves Christian's office believing it went poorly. Ana does not expect to meet Christian again, but he appears at the hardware store where she works. While he purchases various items including cable ties, masking tape, and rope, Ana informs Christian that Kate would like some photographs to illustrate her article about him. Christian gives Ana his phone number. Later, Kate urges Ana to call Christian and arrange a photo shoot with their photographer friend, José Rodriguez.\n\nThe next day José, Kate, and Ana arrive for the photo shoot at the Heathman Hotel, where Christian is staying. Christian asks Ana out for coffee and asks if she is dating anyone, specifically José. Ana replies that she is not dating anyone. During the conversation, Ana learns that Christian is also single, but he says he is not romantic. Ana is intrigued but believes she is not attractive enough for Christian. Later, Ana receives a package from Christian containing first edition copies of \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\", which stuns her. Later that night, Ana goes out drinking with her friends and ends up drunk dialling Christian, who informs her that he will be coming to pick her up because of her inebriated state. Ana goes outside to get some fresh air, and José attempts to kiss her, but he is stopped by Christian's arrival. Ana leaves with Christian, but not before she discovers that Kate has been flirting with Christian's brother, Elliot. Later, Ana wakes to find herself in Christian's hotel room, where he scolds her for not taking proper care of herself. Christian then reveals that he would like to have sex with her. He initially says that Ana will first have to fill in paperwork, but later goes back on this statement after making out with her in the elevator.\n\nAna goes on a date with Christian, on which he takes her in his helicopter, \"Charlie Tango\", to his apartment. Once there, Christian insists that she sign a non-disclosure agreement forbidding her from discussing anything they do together, which Ana agrees to sign. He also mentions other paperwork, but first takes her to his playroom full of BDSM toys and gear. There, Christian informs her that the second contract will be one of dominance and submission, and there will be no romantic relationship, only a sexual one. The contract even forbids Ana from touching Christian or making eye contact with him. At this point, Christian realises that Ana is a virgin and takes her virginity without making her sign the contract. The following morning, Ana and Christian again have sex. His mother arrives moments after their sexual encounter and is surprised by the meeting, having previously thought Christian was homosexual, because he was never seen with a woman. Christian later takes Ana out to eat, and he reveals that he lost his virginity at age 15 to one of his mother's friends, Elena Lincoln, and that his previous dominant/submissive relationships failed due to incompatibility. Christian also reveals that in his first dominant/submissive relationship he was the submissive. Christian and Ana plan to meet again, and he takes Ana home, where she discovers several job offers and admits to Kate that she and Christian had sex.\n\nOver the next few days, Ana receives several packages from Christian. These include a laptop to enable her to research the BDSM lifestyle in consideration of the contract; to communicate with him, since she has never previously owned a computer; and to receive a more detailed version of the dominant/submissive contract. She and Christian email each other, with Ana teasing him and refusing to honour parts of the contract, such as only eating foods from a specific list. Ana later meets with Christian to discuss the contract and becomes overwhelmed by the potential BDSM arrangement and the potential of having a sexual relationship with Christian that is not romantic in nature. Because of these feelings, Ana runs away from Christian and does not see him again until her college graduation, where he is a guest speaker. During this time, Ana agrees to sign the dominant/submissive contract. Ana and Christian once again meet to further discuss the contract, and they go over Ana's hard and soft limits. Christian spanks Ana for the first time, and the experience leaves her both enticed and slightly confused. This confusion is exacerbated by Christian's lavish gifts and the fact that he brings her to meet his family. The two continue with the arrangement without Ana's having yet signed the contract. After successfully landing a job with Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP), Ana further bristles under the restrictions of the non-disclosure agreement and her complex relationship with Christian. The tension between Ana and Christian eventually comes to a head after Ana asks Christian to punish her in order to show her how extreme a BDSM relationship with him could be. Christian fulfils Ana's request, beating her with a belt, and Ana realises they are incompatible. Devastated, she breaks up with Christian and returns to the apartment she shares with Kate.\n\nThe \"Fifty Shades\" trilogy was developed from a \"Twilight\" fan fiction series originally titled \"Master of the Universe\" and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name \"Snowqueen's Icedragon\". The piece featured characters named after Stephenie Meyer's characters in \"Twilight\", Edward Cullen and Bella Swan. After comments concerning the sexual nature of the material, James removed the story from the fan-fiction websites and published it on her own website, FiftyShades.com. Later she rewrote \"Master of the Universe\" as an original piece, with the principal characters renamed Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele and removed it from her website before publication. Meyer commented on the series, saying \"that's really not my genre, not my thing... Good on her—she's doing well. That's great!\"\n\nThis reworked and extended version of \"Master of the Universe\" was split into three parts. The first, titled \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", was released as an e-book and a print on demand paperback in May 2011 by The Writers' Coffee Shop, a virtual publisher based in Australia. The second volume, \"Fifty Shades Darker\", was released in September 2011; and the third, \"Fifty Shades Freed\", followed in January 2012. The Writers' Coffee Shop had a restricted marketing budget and relied largely on book blogs for early publicity, but sales of the novel were boosted by word-of-mouth recommendation. The book's erotic nature and perceived demographic of its fan base as being composed largely of married women over thirty led to the book being dubbed \"Mommy Porn\" by some news agencies. The book has also reportedly been popular among teenage girls and college women. By the release of the final volume in January 2012, news networks in the United States had begun to report on the \"Fifty Shades\" trilogy as an example of viral marketing and of the rise in popularity of female erotica, attributing its success to the discreet nature of e-reading devices. Due to the heightened interest in the series, the license to the \"Fifty Shades\" trilogy was picked up by Vintage Books for re-release in a new and revised edition in April 2012. The attention that the series has garnered has also helped to spark a renewed interest in erotic literature. Many other erotic works quickly became best-sellers following \"Fifty Shades\" success, while other popular works, such as Anne Rice's \"The Sleeping Beauty\" trilogy, have been reissued (this time without pseudonyms) to meet the higher demand.\n\nOn 1 August 2012, Amazon UK announced that it had sold more copies of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" than it had the entire \"Harry Potter\" series combined, making E. L. James its best-selling author, replacing J. K. Rowling, though worldwide the \"Harry Potter\" series sold more than 450 million copies compared with \"Fifty Shades of Grey\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sales of 60 million copies.\n\n\"Fifty Shades of Grey\" has topped best-seller lists around the world, including those of the United Kingdom and the United States. The series had sold over 125 million copies worldwide by June 2015 and has been translated into 52 languages, and set a record in the United Kingdom as the fastest-selling paperback of all time.\n\nIt has received mixed to negative reviews, with most critics noting poor literary qualities of the work. Salman Rushdie said about the book: \"I've never read anything so badly written that got published. It made \"Twilight\" look like \"War and Peace\".\" Maureen Dowd described the book in \"The New York Times\" as being written \"like a Bronte devoid of talent,\" and said it was \"dull and poorly written.\" Jesse Kornbluth of \"The Huffington Post\" said: \"As a reading experience, \"Fifty Shades\" ... is a sad joke, puny of plot\".\n\nPrinceton professor April Alliston wrote, \"Though no literary masterpiece, \"Fifty Shades\" is more than parasitic fan fiction based on the recent \"Twilight\" vampire series.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" writer Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the book a \"B+\" rating and praised it for being \"in a class by itself.\" British author Jenny Colgan in \"The Guardian\" wrote \"It is jolly, eminently readable and as sweet and safe as BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism) erotica can be without contravening the trade descriptions act\" and also praised the book for being \"more enjoyable\" than other \"literary erotic books\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" noted that the book was \"the definition of a page-turner\", noting that the book was both \"troubling and intriguing\". A reviewer for the \"Ledger-Enquirer\" described the book as guilty fun and escapism, and that it \"also touches on one aspect of female existence [female submission]. And acknowledging that fact – maybe even appreciating it – shouldn't be a cause for guilt.\" \"The New Zealand Herald\" stated that the book \"will win no prizes for its prose\" and that \"there are some exceedingly awful descriptions,\" although it was also an easy read; \"(If you only) can suspend your disbelief and your desire to – if you'll pardon the expression – slap the heroine for having so little self respect, you might enjoy it.\" \"The Columbus Dispatch\" stated that, \"Despite the clunky prose, James does cause one to turn the page.\" \"Metro News Canada\" wrote that \"suffering through 500 pages of this heroine's inner dialogue was torturous, and not in the intended, sexy kind of way\". Jessica Reaves, of the \"Chicago Tribune\", wrote that the \"book's source material isn't great literature\", noting that the novel is \"sprinkled liberally and repeatedly with asinine phrases\", and described it as \"depressing\".\n\nThe book garnered some accolades. In December 2012, it won both \"Popular Fiction\" and \"Book of the Year\" categories in the UK National Book Awards. In that same month, \"Publishers Weekly\" named E. L. James the 'Publishing Person of the Year', a decision whose criticism in the \"LA Times\" and the \"New York Daily News\" was referred to by and summarised in \"The Christian Science Monitor\". Earlier, in April 2012, when E. L. James was listed as one of \"Time\" magazine's \"100 Most Influential People in the World\", Richard Lawson of \"The Atlantic Wire\" criticised her inclusion due to the trilogy's fan fiction beginnings.\n\n\"Fifty Shades of Grey\" has attracted criticism due to its depictions of BDSM, with some BDSM participants stating that the book confuses BDSM with abuse and presents it as a pathology to be overcome, as well as showing incorrect and possibly dangerous BDSM techniques.\n\nCoinciding with the release of the book and its surprising popularity, injuries related to BDSM and sex toy use spiked dramatically. In 2012, the year after the book was published, injuries requiring Emergency Room visits increased by over 50% from 2010 (the year before the book was published). This is speculated to be due to people unfamiliar with both the proper use of these toys and the safe practice of bondage and other \"kinky\" sexual fetishes attempting what they had read in the book.\n\nThere has also been criticism against the fact that BDSM is part of the book. Archbishop Dennis Schnurr of Cincinnati said in an early February 2015 letter, \"The story line is presented as a romance; however, the underlying theme is that bondage, dominance, and sadomasochism are normal and pleasurable.\" The feminist anti-pornography organisation Stop Porn Culture called for a boycott of the movie based on the book because of its sex scenes involving bondage and violence. By contrast, Timothy Laurie and Jessica Kean argue that \"film fleshes out an otherwise legalistic concept like 'consent' into a living, breathing, and at times, uncomfortable interpersonal experience,\" and \"dramatises the dangers of unequal negotiation and the practical complexity of identifying one's limits and having them respected.\"\n\nSeveral critics and scientists have expressed concern that the nature of the main couple's relationship is not BDSM at all, but rather is characteristic of an abusive relationship. In 2013, social scientist Professor Amy E. Bonomi published a study wherein the books were read by multiple professionals and assessed for characteristics of intimate partner violence, or IPV, using the CDC's standards for emotional abuse and sexual violence. The study found that nearly every interaction between Ana and Christian was emotionally abusive in nature, including stalking, intimidation, and isolation. The study group also observed pervasive sexual violence within the CDC's definition, including Christian's use of alcohol to circumvent Ana's ability to consent, and that Ana exhibits classic signs of an abused woman, including constant perceived threat, stressful managing, and altered identity.\n\nA second study in 2014 was conducted to examine the health of women who had read the series, compared with a control group that had never read any part of the novels. The results showed a correlation between having read at least the first book and exhibiting signs of an eating disorder, having romantic partners that were emotionally abusive and/or engaged in stalking behaviour, engaging in binge drinking in the last month, and having 5 or more sexual partners before age 24. The authors could not conclude whether women already experiencing these \"problems\" were drawn to the series, or if the series influenced these behaviours to occur after reading by creating underlying context. The study's lead researcher contends that the books romanticise dangerous behaviour and \"perpetuate dangerous abuse standards.\" The study was limited in that only women up to age 24 were studied, and no distinction was made among the reader sample between women who enjoyed the series and those that had a strong negative opinion of it, having only read it out of curiosity due to the media hype or other obligation.\n\nAt the beginning of the media hype, Dr. Drew and sexologist Logan Levkoff discussed on \"The Today Show\" whether the book perpetuated violence against women; Levkoff said that while that is an important subject, this trilogy had nothing to do with it – this was a book about a consensual relationship. Dr. Drew commented that the book was \"horribly written\" in addition to being \"disturbing\" but stated that \"if the book enhances women's real-life sex lives and intimacy, so be it.\"\n\nIn March 2012, branches of the public library in Brevard County, Florida, removed copies of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" from their shelves, with an official stating that it did not meet the selection criteria for the library and that reviews for the book had been poor. A representative for the library stated that it was due to the book's sexual content and that other libraries had declined to purchase copies for their branches. Deborah Caldwell-Stone of the American Library Association commented that \"If the only reason you don't select a book is that you disapprove of its content, but there is demand for it, there's a question of whether you're being fair. In a public library there is usually very little that would prevent a book from being on the shelf if there is a demand for the information.\" Brevard County public libraries later made their copies available to their patrons due to public demand.\n\nIn Macaé, Brazil, Judge Raphael Queiroz Campos ruled in January 2013 that bookstores throughout the city must either remove the series entirely from their shelves or ensure that the books are wrapped and placed out of the reach of minors. The judge stated that he was prompted to make such an order after seeing children reading them, basing his decision on a law stating that \"magazines and publications whose content is improper or inadequate for children and adolescents can only be sold if sealed and with warnings regarding their content\".\n\nIn February 2015, the Malaysian Home Ministry banned the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" books shortly after banning its film adaptation after permitting them for three years in local bookstores, citing morality-related reasons.\n\nA film adaptation of the book was produced by Focus Features, Michael De Luca Productions, and Trigger Street Productions, with Universal Pictures and Focus Features securing the rights to the trilogy in March 2012. Universal is also the film's distributor. Charlie Hunnam was originally cast in the role of Christian Grey alongside Dakota Johnson in the role of Anastasia Steele, but Hunnam gave up the part in October 2013, with Jamie Dornan announced for the role on 23 October.\n\nThe film was released on 13 February 2015, and although popular at the box office, critical reactions were mixed to negative.\n\nE. L. James announced the film's soundtrack would be released on 10 February 2015. Prior to the soundtrack's release, the first single, \"Earned It\", by The Weeknd, was released on 24 December 2014. On 7 January 2015, the second single, \"Love Me like You Do\" by Ellie Goulding was released. Australian singer Sia released the soundtrack's third single, \"Salted Wound\", on 27 January 2015.\n\nAn album of songs selected by E. L. James was released on 11 September 2012 by EMI Classics under the title \"Fifty Shades of Grey: The Classical Album\", and reached number four on the US \"Billboard\" classical music albums chart in October 2012. A \"Seattle P-I\" reviewer favourably wrote that the album would appeal both to fans of the series and to \"those who have no intention of reading any of the Grey Shades\".\n\nThe \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" trilogy has inspired many parodies in print, in film, online, and on stage. In November 2012, Universal Studios attempted to prevent the release of \"Fifty Shades of Grey: A XXX Adaptation\", a pornographic film based on the novel, citing copyright and trademark infringement. Smash Pictures, the porn producer, later responded to the lawsuit with a counterclaim that \"much or all\" of the \"Fifty Shades\" material was placed in the public domain in its original \"Twilight\"-based form, but later capitulated and stopped production of their film.\n\nAmazon.com lists over 50 book parodies, e.g.:\n\n\n\nStage productions include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56864754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56864754", "title": "Florence (video game)", "text": "Florence (video game)\n\nFlorence is an interactive story and video game developed by the Australian studio Mountains and published by Annapurna Interactive. The game was released on February 14, 2018 (Valentine's Day) for iOS and on March 14, 2018 for Android. In \"Florence\", the player follows the story of 25-year-old Florence Yeoh as she lives her daily routine and meets Krish, a cellist she sees in the park. The game features little written dialogue and tells Florence's story through a series of brief chapters. The game uses basic puzzles to reinforce pieces of Florence's life as players progress through her story.\n\nLead designer Ken Wong wanted to create games that eschewed violence and was inspired by his work on \"Monument Valley\" to have a more narrative-focused experience that included puzzles. The game received favorable reviews that praised the game's art-style, music, and narrative structure.\n\n\"Florence\" is divided into 20 chapters, each featuring a different portion of Florence Yeoh's life. The chapters are separated into six acts, which represent different portions of Florence's growth and change. The game plays out linearly, requiring input from the player in the form of short minigames which help mimic or reveal Florence's thoughts and actions. These games include: Florence brushing her teeth, Florence following the sound of a cello to find Krish, Krish cleaning his room before Florence visits, and Florence packing up her things when Krish moves in—and giving Krish's things back to him when he moves out—among others. A single play-through of \"Florence\" takes approximately 30 minutes.\n\nThe game follows Florence Yeoh, a 25-year-old woman who lives alone and is settled into a monotonous routine of working at her job and mindlessly interacting with social media on her commute. One morning, her phone dies and she follows the sound of a cello and sees Krish, a street performer, for the first time. Krish befriends her and they go out on some dates. They kiss for the first time and begin to take their relationship more seriously. Krish moves in with Florence and is pushed by her to follow his dreams of being a great cellist. As a thank you, Krish gives Florence a painting set and Florence fantasizes about following her passion of being an artist.\n\nThe couple have their first fight six months later at a grocery store. After a year, the two have fallen into a routine and begin to drift apart. After another fight, Krish moves out. Florence decides to quit her job and follow her painting passion, where she finds success.\n\nAfter his success with \"Monument Valley\", game designer Ken Wong felt that he had done what he could at his development studio, Ustwo, and wanted to create his own studio. He chose to move back to his native Australia after seeing the game development scene in Melbourne grow. Wong founded a new company, Mountains, in Melbourne.\n\nAfter hiring staff, Mountains had no direction on what kind of game they wanted to create. Wong's approach was to first hire the team and then come up with a solid game. The staff discussed how film and books regularly explored love and human emotions, but that it was missing from game design and it would be a \"good challenge.\" They opted to move forward and create \"Florence\". It was the first game Wong had worked on since \"Monument Valley\". \n\nWong and the rest of the team wanted to create a game that eschewed violence. Wong said, \"I wanted to explore what kind of stories and what kind of dynamics we can get without resorting to violence.\" Mountains decided to make the game on mobile so it could be as accessible as possible. The team's goal was to create a game where players focus on exploring emotions instead of achieving goals. In contrast to Wong's previous game, \"Monument Valley\", Wong wanted to create an experience that was similar to a comic book or silent movie with a focus on narrative. Wong and the team were inspired by film in creating \"Florence\", and specifically cited \"500 Days of Summer\", \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", and \"Titanic\". \n\nThe developers wanted to make the game a linear experience early on in the process because of a concern that people with more life experience would make the \"correct\" choices and avoid the moral of the game. Mountains was inspired by the way people consume other media for the emotional connections they bring, and wanted to bring that feeling to video games. The team decided to use music as a substitute for dialogue throughout the game, with the cello representing Krish while the piano follows Florence. Mountains used musical themes for the characters after accidentally creating them during development of the \"Groceries\" chapter, where Krish and Florence have their first fight. Wong chose the name Florence as she was designed to be a Chinese Australian whose parents picked an \"old fashioned name\" for their daughter when they immigrated.\n\n\"Florence\" was announced on October 24, 2017. A demo shown publicly at PAX Australia 2017 focused on the first 15 minutes of the game. The game received positive marks from Australian video game journalists. \"Kotaku Australia\" Rae Johnston called \"Florence\" her \"stand-out game\" and felt that the game's minigames succeeded in making her invested in the characters. \"PC Authority\" Alayna Cole praised the game for standing out with a story about love and diversity, describing it as feeling \"like a rarity\" in modern video game culture.\n\n\"Florence\" was well received by critics. CJ Andriessen of \"Destructoid\" described the game as \"a truly beautiful product\" and felt that the game was one of the most imaginative storytelling devices he had ever seen. Tim Biggs of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" felt that the minigames made \"Florence\" \"truly special\" and that it was \"breathtaking and emotionally affirming\". Jordan Erica Webber of \"The Guardian\" praised \"Florence\"s ability to capture \"what it's like to fall in love for the first time.\" \"Eurogamer\" Christian Donlan noted that the game's puzzle format to life doesn't \"quite work\" but still loved the journey the game provided. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" Patrick Shanley praised Wong and his team for nailing the \"getting to know you\" aspect of dating. IGN Japan's Esra Krabbe called it a \"universal work of art\" and praised it as a game that anyone could play. \"The Guardian\" Simon Parkin listed \"Florence\" as his \"Game of the Month\" and noted that the game never felt trite and was well executed.\n\nMany reviewers compared the game to the \"WarioWare\" series. \"The Verge\" Andrew Webster compared the game to a \"webcomic crossed with \"Warioware\",\" and \"Polygon\" Allegra Frank praised the game's minigames as making the emotional component of the game resonate with the player. Destructoid's Andriessen echoed Frank on the effectiveness of the minigames and felt that the game was a \"beautiful product\".\n\nCriticism focused on some story elements, specifically its ending. \"Destructoid\" Andriessen stated that the game left him with a \"pessimistic opinion\" about love and noted that \"it's the narcissistic pursuit of their real passion, art, that wins out in the end.\" \"Eurogamer\" Donlan felt that the ending traded \"one easy cliché for another\", although concluding that the ending's disappointment may have been the point.\n"}

It is \"the 'throwing into relief' of the linguistic sign against the background of the norms of ordinary language.\" The term was first associated with Paul Garvin in the 1960s, who used it as a translation of the Czech \"aktualisace\" (literally \"to actualise\"), borrowing the terms from the Prague school of the 1930s.\n\nThere are two main types of foregrounding: parallelism and deviation. Parallelism can be described as unexpected regularity, while deviation can be seen as unexpected irregularity. As the definition of foregrounding indicates, these are relative concepts. Something can only be unexpectedly regular or irregular within a particular context. This context can be relatively narrow, such as the immediate textual surroundings (referred to as a 'secondary norm') or wider such as an entire genre (referred to as a 'primary norm').\n\nFor example, the last line of a poem with a consistent metre may be foregrounded by changing the number of syllables it contains. This would be an example of a deviation from a secondary norm. In the following poem by E. E. Cummings, there are two types of deviation:\n\nFirstly, most of the poem deviates from 'normal' language (primary deviation). In addition, there is secondary deviation in that the penultimate line is unexpectedly different from the rest of the poem. Nursery rhymes, adverts and slogans often exhibit parallelism in the form of repetition and rhyme, but parallelism can also occur over longer texts. For example, jokes are often built on a mixture of parallelism and deviation. They often consist of three parts or characters. The first two are very similar (parallelism) and the third one starts out as similar, but our expectations are thwarted when it turns out different in end (deviation).\n\nForegrounding can occur on all levels of language (phonology, graphology, morphology, lexis, syntax, semantics and pragmatics). It is generally used to highlight important parts of a text, to aid memorability and/or to invite interpretation.\n\n"}

Other sellers commonly sold them with their own brand names but most or all resellers still called them a Guitaro.\nThe Guitaro's strings are longer than used on medium-sized or larger autoharps, resulting in a lower tone than usual. The instruments have 15 chord bars, and have fewer strings than most medium or larger sized autoharps, all of which somewhat limits their versatility. Like other autoharps, either fingerpicks or a flatpick can be used. Sara Carter played a Guitaro in some performances, and videos can still be found online showing her playing one.\n\nIn 1964, the \"Guitaro\" was introduced by Oscar Schmidt-International. Designed by Glen Peterson and Henry Ruckner, the instrument came in two models. One sported a resonator and had a soundhole in its back; the other had the soundhole in the front and no resonator. The resonator model was dropped in the early 70s.\n"}

{"id": "6265910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6265910", "title": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n\nThe James S. Brady Press Briefing Room is a small theater in the West Wing of the White House where the White House Press Secretary gives briefings to the news media and the President of the United States sometimes addresses the press and the nation. It is located between the workspace assigned to the White House press corps and the office of the Press Secretary.\n\nThe first presidential press conference was held on 15 March 1913 in the Oval Office, during the presidency of Woodrow Wilson. Subsequently, through to 1969, communications from the President and general press news conferences took place in various locations, including the Indian Treaty Room, the State Department auditorium, and the White House East Room. \n\nIn 1969, to accommodate the growing number of reporters assigned to the White House, President Richard Nixon had the indoor swimming pool, which had been installed by the March of Dimes for Franklin D. Roosevelt, covered and turned into press offices and a lounge that could double as a briefing room. \n\nIn 2000, the room was renamed the \"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\" in honor of James Brady, the press secretary who had been shot and permanently disabled during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981.\n\nIn December 2005, the White House announced the intention to renovate the aging Press Briefing Room and cramped press corps offices. On August 2, 2006, the final briefing was held, and President George W. Bush hosted several previous press secretaries at a closing ceremony and there was some hesitation and concern about whether the press would be allowed to return to the White House. In the interim, the White House Conference Center was used as temporary location for press conferences.\n\nPresident Bush reopened the renovated room in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on the morning of July 11, 2007. He held his first formal press conference in the new briefing room the next day, following the release of a report on the progress of the Iraqi government. The modernization cost nearly US$8.5 million. Of that sum, $2.5 million was funded by the media, and the remainder was funded by tax dollars. Each correspondent's seat was priced at $1,500. Beneath the current press room lies the former White House swimming pool that has since become a computer server room.\n\nThe most noticeable change to the briefing room was a different backdrop for the press conferences, which now featured a softly lit screen flanked by mock columns, instead of the previous blue curtain. The new podium contained video screens for teleconferencing and multimedia displays. For safety reasons, the trapdoor which provided access to the old swimming pool (a popular stop for visitors) was replaced by a discreet staircase.\n\nDespite complaints about the previous briefing room's lack of space, the current briefing room has only one more press seat than it did prior to renovation.\n\nThe seating assignments are organized by the White House Correspondents' Association, not by the White House press staff.\n"}
{"id": "35442894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35442894", "title": "Kharabeesh", "text": "Kharabeesh\n\nKharabeesh ( ) is a Jordan-based company that produces Arabic-language animated cartoons, music videos and talk shows that generally tackle political issues in the Arab world. The top four most-viewed Kharabeesh videos posted on YouTube have more than 2 million views. All views feature either Housni Mubarak or Muammar Gaddafi. \"Karabeesh\" means \"scribbles\" in Arabic. The political cartoons produced by Kharabeesh have received international attention during and after the Arab Spring revolutions.\n\nKharabeesh is part of Think Arabia, a media group that “aims to be a leading creative production, technology and publishing company for the new media platforms in the region and the world.\"\n\nKharabeesh was co-founded by Jordanian blogger Wael Attili, Mohammad Asfour and Wafa Nabulsi, in 2008. Their aim was to produce satirical animated videos and distribute them solely through new media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Attili traces the genesis of the idea for Kharabeesh to 2005-2006, when the founders felt that there was “a lack and a need for Arabic content” in the world of social media and online videos. Initially operating out of a small office in Jabal Amman, Amman, Kharabeesh has now grown to become an open space where illustrators, animators, designers work collaboratively. A profile of Kharabeesh and Attili in the magazine Jordan Business writes that \"Attili brought together his college buddies, who were all struggling to manage their own slew of start-ups in the web industry, and decided to form Kharabeesh.\" \n\nThe founders of Kharabeesh originally decided to orient their content along political themes that are salient for most Arabs, as opposed to cultural and social issues that are distinct to each individual country. The Kharabeesh founders also felt that the internet and online media were the ideal platforms on which to tackle these issues, offering more freedom of expression than was available in traditional print media, in which the \"ceiling of freedom\" is much lower.\n\nWhen it was initially launched, Kharabeesh, and in order to create a sustainable group of companies to be able to serve each other and form a new concept of partnership in the Arab world, each partner merged their own start-ups in the tech and web fields to create a mother company called Think Arabia with other two partners, Firas Otaibi and Shaher Otaibi. In doing so, Kharabeesh was able to outsource its web and graphic design services to the sister companies in order that each company would in turn assist the others' financial viability.\n\nAlthough Kharabeesh was active before the Arab Spring, the popularity of their political videos during the wave of revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and elsewhere in the Arab world pushed the company to a new level of recognition. The popularity of the political cartoons in particular was such that a Tunisian television channel volunteered to translate a video about the flight of deposed Tunisian President Ben Ali from Arabic to Spanish.\n\nCurrently Kharabeesh CEO, Attili has said that the Kharabeesh script-writing and animation team draws “inspiration from our personal, everyday experiences ... using them to power our sketches and cartoons … That’s what makes them so appealing to people.” Attili is one of Jordan's longest-active bloggers, having begun blogging in 2005.\n\nAttili maintains that Kharabeesh was built out of the idea that “a new creative industry was emerging in the Arab world,\" and that secret of Kharabeesh's success lies in its emphasis on creativity rather than profit. Although the company sometimes takes individual commissions from clients, most of its work is generated in-house and involves testing the success of ideas in order to determine if potential buyers are interested. According to Attili, creation and execution come before business and funding, saying that the company values “new, funny and edgy mini-cartoon shows designed specifically for the wed audience.”\n\nKharabeesh's cartoons have been compared to JibJab, not only because of their political nature but also their animation style and technique. Kharabeesh shares their techniques on a \"KharabeeshWorkshop\" channel on YouTube.\n\nBetween January 30, 2011 and February 1, 2011, Kharabeesh released two animated shorts depicting then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak addressing the Egyptian people following the ousting of Tunisian President Ben Ali. In the first animated video of the series, which as of April 8, 2012 has over 1,800,000 views on YouTube, Housni Mubarak addresses the Egyptian people in Egyptian Colloquial Arabic, a clear departure from the public speeches he had recently given at the time, which were noted to have been delivered solely in Modern Standard Arabic. The caricatured Mubarak offers trivial solutions to the Egyptian people and pledges not to leave his position, before punched off his podium by a fist representing \"the People.\" In the second video of the series, Mubarak addresses an angry mob, ignoring their chants demanding that he step down. A week later, Kharabeesh launched the third and final video of the series, which shows Mubarak receiving phone calls of congratulations from his counterparts abroad.\n\nKharabeesh has also produced videos satirizing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, and Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nAccording to a statement by Wael Attili to the Saudi channel Al Arabiya in 2011, the company's market value is between 7 and 8 million dollars.\n\n"}

{"id": "33190861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33190861", "title": "List of James Bond films", "text": "List of James Bond films\n\nJames Bond is a fictional character created by novelist Ian Fleming in 1953. Bond is a British secret agent working for MI6 who also answers to his codename, 007. He has been portrayed on film by actors Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig, in twenty-six productions. All the films but two were made by Eon Productions. Eon now holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.\n\nIn 1961 producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman joined forces to purchase the filming rights to Fleming's novels. They founded the production company Eon Productions and, with financial backing by United Artists, began working on \"Dr. No\", which was directed by Terence Young and featured Connery as Bond. Following \"Dr. No\"s release in 1962, Broccoli and Saltzman created the holding company Danjaq to ensure future productions in the \"James Bond\" film series. The series currently encompasses twenty-four films, with the most recent, \"Spectre\", released in October 2015. With a combined gross of nearly $7 billion to date, the films produced by Eon constitute the fourth-highest-grossing film series, behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \"Star Wars\", and Wizarding World films. Accounting for the effects of inflation the Bond films have amassed over $14 billion at current prices. The films have won five Academy Awards: for Sound Effects (now Sound Editing) in \"Goldfinger\" (at the 37th Awards), to John Stears for Visual Effects in \"Thunderball\" (at the 38th Awards), to Per Hallberg and Karen Baker Landers for Sound Editing, and to Adele and Paul Epworth for Original Song in \"Skyfall\" (at the 85th Awards), and to Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for Original Song in \"Spectre\" (at the 88th Awards). Additionally, several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song, including Paul McCartney's \"Live and Let Die\", Carly Simon's \"Nobody Does It Better\" and Sheena Easton's \"For Your Eyes Only\". In 1982, Albert R. Broccoli received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.\n\nWhen Broccoli and Saltzman bought the rights to existing and future Fleming titles, it did not include \"Casino Royale\", which had already been sold to producer Gregory Ratoff, with the story having been adapted for television in 1954. After Ratoff's death, the rights were passed on to Charles K. Feldman, who subsequently produced the satirical Bond spoof \"Casino Royale\" in 1967. A legal case ensured that the film rights to the novel \"Thunderball\" were held by Kevin McClory as he, Fleming and scriptwriter Jack Whittingham had written a film script upon which the novel was based. Although Eon Productions and McClory joined forces to produce \"Thunderball\", McClory still retained the rights to the story and adapted \"Thunderball\" into 1983's \"Never Say Never Again\". The current distribution rights to both of those films are held by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio which distributes Eon's regular series.\n\nStrangways, the British Intelligence (SIS) Station Chief in Jamaica, is killed. In response, British agent James Bond—also known as 007—is sent to Jamaica to investigate the circumstances. During his investigation Bond meets Quarrel, a Cayman fisherman, who had been working with Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. One of the islands was Crab Key, home to the reclusive Dr. No.\n\nBond visits the island, where he meets a local shell diver, Honey Ryder. The three are attacked by No's men, who kill Quarrel using a flame-throwing armoured tractor; Bond and Honey are taken prisoner. Dr. No informs them he is a member of SPECTRE, the SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion, and he plans to disrupt the Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam. Bond and Honey escape from the island, killing No and blowing up his lair in the process.\n\nSPECTRE's expert planner Kronsteen, known as \"Number Twelve\", upon order of the organization's Number One, devises a plot to steal a Lektor cryptographic device from the Soviets and sell it back to them while exacting revenge on Bond for killing their agent Dr. No; ex-SMERSH operative Rosa Klebb, SPECTRE's Number Three, is in charge of the mission. She recruits Donald Grant as an assassin and Tatiana Romanova, a cipher clerk at the Soviet consulate in Istanbul, as the unwitting bait.\n\nBond travels to Turkey and meets with Ali Kerim Bey, the MI6 officer in Turkey. Between them, they obtain the Lektor, and the three escape with the device on the Orient Express. However, they are followed by Grant, who kills Kerim Bey and a Soviet security officer. Grant pretends to be another British agent and meets Bond. Over dinner Grant drugs Romanova, then overcomes Bond. Bond tricks Grant into opening Bond's attaché case in the manner that detonates its tear gas booby trap, allowing Bond to attack and kill him. Bond and Romanova escape with the Lektor to Venice. Rosa Klebb, disguised as a hotel maid, attempts to steal the Lektor and kill Bond, but ends up being shot by Romanova.\n\nBond is ordered to observe bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger. He suspects Goldfinger of cheating at cards and foils his scheme by distracting his female accomplice, who is later killed by Goldfinger's Korean manservant and henchman Oddjob after Bond seduces her. Bond is then instructed to investigate Goldfinger's gold smuggling operation and he tails the dealer to Switzerland. Bond is captured when he reconnoitres Goldfinger's plant and is drugged unconscious; Goldfinger then transports Bond to his Kentucky stud farm where he holds Bond captive. Bond escapes briefly to witness Goldfinger's meeting with US mafiosi, observing secretly as Goldfinger presents to the gangsters his plans to rob Fort Knox by using materials they have smuggled to him and later kills them to avoid paying issues.\n\nBond is recaptured after hearing the details of the operation, but he subsequently seduces Pussy Galore, Goldfinger's private pilot and convinces her to inform the American authorities. Goldfinger's private army break into Fort Knox and access the vault, where Bond fights and kills Oddjob, while American troops battle with Goldfinger's army outside. Bond's plane is hijacked by Goldfinger, but Bond struggles with him, and shoots out a window, creating an explosive decompression, killing Goldfinger.\n\nBond investigates the hijacking of an Avro Vulcan loaded with two atomic bombs, which had been taken by SPECTRE. The organisation demands a ransom for the return of the bombs. Bond follows a lead to the Bahamas, where he meets up with his CIA counterpart and friend Felix Leiter. The pair suspect a rich playboy, Emilio Largo, who is soon discovered to be SPECTRE's Number Two, ordered by the secretive Number One to direct the operation, and search the area around his yacht and then the area where they think the yacht may have travelled. After finding the plane—but without the nuclear devices on board—the two agents arrange for Largo's yacht to be tracked and ambushed once the bombs are being moved by Largo.\n\nBond is brought out of retirement to deal with SMERSH and is promoted to the head of MI6 on the death of M. He recruits baccarat player Evelyn Tremble to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre. Having embezzled SMERSH's money, Le Chiffre is desperate for money to cover up his theft. Tremble stops Le Chiffre's cheating and beats him in a game of baccarat. Tremble is captured, tortured and killed. Bond establishes that the casino is located atop a giant underground headquarters run by the evil Dr. Noah; he and Moneypenny travel there to investigate. Dr. Noah turns out to be Sir James's nephew Jimmy Bond, who plans to use biological warfare to make all women beautiful and kill all tall men, leaving him as the \"big man\" who gets all the girls. The casino is then overrun by secret agents and a battle ensues, but the building explodes, killing all inside.\n\n007 is sent to Japan to investigate the spacecraft theft and astronaut kidnapping in orbit of American Project Gemini spacecraft \"Jupiter 16\" by an unidentified spacecraft. Upon his arrival, Bond is contacted by Aki, assistant to the Japanese secret service leader Tiger Tanaka. Bond established that the mastermind behind the hijacking is SPECTRE's Number One, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, in conjunction with Osato, a local industrialist. Bond follows the trail to Blofeld's island headquarters and spaceport, while the spacecraft, \"Bird One\", attacks a Soviet capsule. Blofeld explains Bond that his plot is to fake in front of each superpower that \"Bird One\" is an enemy spacecraft to transform the Cold War in World War III.\n\nTanaka's ninja troops attack the island, while Bond manages to distract Blofeld and create a diversion which allows him to open the hatch, letting in the ninjas. During the battle, Osato is killed by Blofeld, who activates the base's self-destruct system and escapes. Bond, Kissy, Tanaka, and the surviving ninjas escape through the cave tunnel before it explodes, and are rescued by submarine.\n\nWhile searching for Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE, Bond saves Tracy di Vicenzo on the beach from committing suicide by drowning, and later meets her again in a casino. Bond then receives information from Marc-Ange Draco, the head of the European crime syndicate \"Unione Corse\" and Tracy's father, about Blofeld's Swiss solicitor. Bond breaks into the solicitors office and establishes Blofeld is corresponding with the London College of Arms. Posing as an emissary of the college, Bond meets Blofeld, who has established a clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps. Bond soon establishes that Blofeld is brainwashing his patients to distribute bacteriological warfare agents throughout various parts of the world.\n\nBond escapes from the clinic after Blofeld identifies him as the British agent. Bond arranges a raid on the clinic using men from Draco's organisation. The raid is a success, although Blofeld escapes. Bond marries Tracy, but she is murdered shortly afterwards by Irma Bunt, Blofeld's partner.\n\nBond is tasked with investigating a major diamond smuggling ring which begins in Africa and runs through Holland and the UK to the United States. Disguised as professional smuggler and murderer Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case: he is given the diamonds and travels on to the US, where he is met by Felix Leiter. Bond moves through the chain, which leads to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte.\n\nBond follows the diamonds to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where he finds that a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains to him that the satellite can blow up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil rig as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.\n\nJames Bond is sent to investigate the murder of three British MI6 agents, all of whom have been killed within 24 hours. He discovers the victims were all separately investigating the operations of Dr. Kananga, the dictator of a small Caribbean island, San Monique. He also establishes that Kananga also acts as Mr. Big, a ruthless and cunning gangster.\n\nUpon visiting San Monique, Bond determines that Kananga is producing two tons of heroin and is protecting the poppy fields by exploiting locals' fear of voodoo and the occult. Through his alter ego, Mr. Big, Kananga plans to distribute the heroin free of charge at his Fillet of Soul restaurants, which will increase the number of addicts. Bond is captured by Kananga, but he escapes, killing Kananga and destroying the poppy crop.\n\nAfter receiving a golden bullet with James Bond's code \"007\" etched into its surface M relieves Bond of a mission locating a British scientist, Gibson, who has invented the \"Solex agitator\", a device to harness solar power, thereby solving the energy crisis. The bullet signifies Bond is a target of assassin Francisco Scaramanga and Bond sets out unofficially to find him. From a spent golden bullet, Bond tracks Scaramanga to Macau, where he sees Scaramanga's mistress collecting golden bullets at a casino. Bond follows her to Hong Kong, where he witnesses the murder of Gibson and the theft of the Solex agitator. Bond is subsequently assigned to retrieve the agitator and assassinate Scaramanga.\n\nBond meets with Hai Fat, a wealthy Thai entrepreneur suspected of arranging Gibson's murder, and is captured, but subsequently escapes. He tracks Scaramanga to an island in Red Chinese waters, where the two men fight and Bond kills the assassin.\n\nBond is tasked with investigating the disappearance of British and Soviet ballistic missile submarines and the subsequent offer to sell a submarine tracking system. Bond works alongside Major Anya Amasova of the KGB. The pair track the plans across Egypt and identify the person responsible for the thefts as shipping tycoon, scientist and anarchist Karl Stromberg.\n\nBond and Amasova follow a suspicious tanker owned by Stromberg and establish it is responsible for the missing submarines; the submarine in which they are travelling is also captured by Stromberg. Stromberg plans to destroy Moscow and New York, triggering nuclear war; he planned to then establish a new civilisation. Bond escapes, freeing the submariners captured from the other submarines and follows Stromberg to his headquarters, where he shoots the tycoon and a torpedo destroys the base.\n\nA Drax Industries Moonraker space shuttle on loan is hijacked and Bond is ordered to investigate. Bond meets the owner of the company, Hugo Drax and one of Drax's scientists, Dr. Holly Goodhead. Bond follows the trail to Venice, where he establishes that Drax is manufacturing a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Bond again meets Goodhead and finds out that she is a CIA agent.\n\nBond travels to the Amazon looking for Drax's research facility, where he is captured. He and Goodhead pose as pilots on one of six space shuttles being sent by Drax to a hidden space station. There Bond finds out that Drax plans to destroy all human life by launching fifty globes containing the toxin into the Earth's atmosphere. Bond and Goodhead disable the radar jammer hiding the station from Earth and the US sends a platoon of Marines in a military space shuttle. During the battle, Bond kills Drax and his station is destroyed.\n\nAfter a British spy boat sinks, a marine archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, is tasked to retrieve its Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC) communication system before the Russians do. After Havelock is murdered by Gonzales, a Cuban hit-man, Bond is ordered to find out who hired Gonzales. While investigating, Bond is captured, but Gonzales is subsequently killed by Havelock's daughter Melina, and she and Bond escape. Bond identifies one of those present with Gonzales as Emile Leopold Locque and so follows a lead to Italy and meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and a well-connected Greek businessman and intelligence informant, Aris Kristatos. Kristatos tells Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, Kristatos' former organised crime partner.\n\nAfter Ferrara is murdered—and the evidence points to Columbo—Bond is captured by men working for Columbo. Columbo then explains that Locque was actually hired by Kristatos, who is working for the KGB to retrieve the ATAC. Bond and Melina recover the ATAC but are captured by Kristatos. They escape and follow Kristatos to Greece, where he is killed and the ATAC is destroyed by Bond.\n\nBond investigates the murder of 009, killed in East Berlin while dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Fabergé egg. An identical egg appears at auction and Bond establishes the buyer, exiled Afghan prince, Kamal Khan is working with Orlov, a renegade Soviet general, who is seeking to expand Soviet borders into Europe. Bond meets Octopussy, a wealthy woman who leads the Octopus cult. Bond finds out that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures, replacing them with replicas, while Khan has been smuggling the real versions into the West, via Octopussy's circus troupe.\n\nBond infiltrates the circus, and finds that Orlov replaced the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead, primed to explode at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament, in the belief that the bomb was an American one that was detonated by accident, leaving the West's borders open to Soviet invasion. Bond deactivates the warhead and then he returns to India, joining an assault on Khan's palace.\n\nBond investigates the hijacking of two cruise missiles with live nuclear warheads which had been taken by SPECTRE. He meets Domino Petachi, the pilot's sister, and her lover, Maximillian Largo, SPECTRE's Number One, who directly responds to Blofeld. Following them to France, Bond informs Domino of her brother's death and subsequently finds his MI6 colleague killed by Fatima Blush, another SPECTRE agent: Bond kills her. Bond and Felix Leiter then attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the Flying Saucer, in search of the missing nuclear warheads. Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in North Africa, but Bond subsequently escapes with Domino. The two agents ambush Largo while he is placing one of the bombs.\n\nBond investigates millionaire industrialist Max Zorin, who is trying to corner the world market in microchips. He establishes that Zorin was previously trained and financed by the KGB, but has now gone rogue. Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley which will give him a monopoly in the manufacturing of microchips.\n\nBond uncovers Zorin's plan is to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the Hayward and San Andreas faults, which will cause them to flood. A larger bomb is also on site in the mine to destroy a \"geological lock\" that prevents the two faults from moving at the same time. Bond destroys the bomb, and subsequently kills Zorin.\n\nBond aids the defection of KGB officer General Georgi Koskov, by wounding a female KGB sniper, Kara Milovy, a cellist. During his debriefing Koskov alleges KGB's old policy of \"Smiert Spionam\", meaning \"Death to Spies\", has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is subsequently abducted from the safe-house and Bond is ordered to kill Pushkin.\n\nBond tracks down Milovy and establishes she is Koskov's girlfriend and that the defection was staged. He subsequently finds out that Koskov is a friend of the arms dealer Brad Whitaker. After meeting Pushkin and faking his assassination by Bond, Bond investigates a scheme by Koskov and Whitaker to embezzle KGB funds and use them to purchase diamonds, which they then use to purchase drugs. After Koskov purchases the drugs, Bond destroys them. Koskov is subsequently arrested by Pushkin, while Bond kills Whitaker.\n\nBond aids Felix Leiter in the capture of drugs lord Franz Sanchez; Sanchez escapes and maims Leiter, killing his wife. Bond swears revenge, but is ordered to return to duty by M. Bond refuses, and M revokes his licence to kill, causing Bond to become a rogue agent; although officially stripped of his status, he is unofficially given help by Q.\n\nBond journeys to Sanchez's home in the Republic of Isthmus and is taken onto Sanchez's staff, where he manages to raise Sanchez's suspicions against a number of his employees. When Bond is taken to Sanchez's main base and drugs refinery, he is recognised by one of Sanchez's men and captured. He escapes, destroying the refinery in the process, and pursues Sanchez, killing him.\n\nIn 1986 Bond and Alec Trevelyan—agent 006—infiltrate an illicit Soviet chemical weapons facility and plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is shot, but Bond escapes from the facility as it explodes. Nine years later, Bond witnesses the theft by criminal organisation Janus of a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter that can withstand an electromagnetic pulse. Janus uses the helicopter to steal the control disk for the dual GoldenEye satellite weapons, using the GoldenEye to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse; there are two survivors of the attack, the programmers, Natalya Simonov and Boris Grishenko.\n\nBond investigates the attack and travels to Russia where he locates Simonova and learns that Trevelyan, who had faked his own death, was the head of Janus. Simonova tracks computer traffic to Cuba and she and Bond travel there and locate Trevelyan, who reveals his plan to steal money from the Bank of England before erasing all of its financial records with the GoldenEye, concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy. Bond and Simonova destroy the satellite facility, killing Trevelyan and Grishenko in the process.\n\nBond investigates the sinking of a British warship in Chinese waters, the theft of one of the ship's cruise missiles—and the shooting down of a Chinese fighter plane. He uncovers a link to media mogul Elliot Carver which suggests that Carver had purchased a GPS encoder on the black market.\n\nBond encounters Chinese agent Wai Lin, who is also investigating the matter and the two agree to work together. They discover that Carver had used the GPS encoder to push the British ship off course and into Chinese waters to incite a war for ratings. With the British fleet on their way to China, Bond and Wai Lin find Carver's stealth ship, board it and prevent the firing of a British cruise missile at Beijing. They blow a hole in the ship, exposing it to radar, leading to its sinking averting war between Britain and China.\n\nBond recovers money for Sir Robert King, a British oil tycoon and friend of M, but the money is booby-trapped and kills King shortly afterwards. Bond traces the money to Renard, a KGB agent-turned-terrorist, who had previously kidnapped King's daughter Elektra. MI6 believes that Renard is targeting Elektra King a second time and Bond is assigned to protect her; the pair are subsequently attacked.\n\nBond visits Valentin Zukovsky and is informed that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is in league with Renard: Bond kills Davidov and follows the trail to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. Posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, Bond meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones. The two witness Renard stealing the GPS locator card and a half quantity of weapons-grade plutonium from a bomb and set off an explosion, from which Bond and Jones escape. Elektra kidnaps M after she thinks Bond had been killed and Bond establishes that Elektra intends to create a nuclear explosion in a submarine in Istanbul to increase the value of her own oil pipeline. Bond frees M, kills Elektra and then disarms the bomb on the submarine where he kills Renard.\n\nBond investigates North Korean Colonel Tan-Sun Moon, who is illegally trading African conflict diamonds for weapons. Moon is apparently killed and Bond is captured and tortured for 14 months, after which he is exchanged for Zao, Moon's assistant. Despite being suspended on his return, he decides to complete his mission and tracks down Zao to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Zao escapes, but the trail leads to British billionaire Gustav Graves.\n\nGraves unveils a mirror satellite, \"Icarus\", which is able to focus solar energy on a small area and provide year-round sunshine for crop development. Bond discovers Moon has also undergone the gene therapy and has assumed the identity of Graves. Bond then exposes Moon's plan: to use the Icarus as a sun gun to cut a path through the Korean Demilitarized Zone with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea and reunite the countries through force. Bond disables the Icarus controls, kills Moon and stops the invasion.\n\nA reboot of the series, with Bond winning his 00 status in the pre-credits sequence. Bond is instructed to investigate the funding of terrorism. He tracks down and kills a bomb-maker and takes his mobile phone. Searching through the phone, Bond discovers a text message which he traces to Alex Dimitrios, and then on to financer Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre's investments involve short-selling stock in successful companies and then engineering terrorist attacks to sink their share prices. Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype \"Skyfleet\" airliner, which forces Le Chiffre to set up a high-stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale to recoup his fortune. Bond is instructed to beat Le Chiffre and is aided by a member of HM Treasury, Vesper Lynd.\n\nBond beats Le Chiffre at the poker table, but Lynd is kidnapped by Le Chiffre after the game, as is Bond, who is captured whilst pursuing them; Lynd is ransomed for the money and Bond is tortured. Le Chiffre is subsequently killed by Mr. White, a liaison between Le Chiffre and a number of his clients. Bond learns that his poker winnings were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd was supposed to have done, and Bond establishes that she was a double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, but White takes the money and Lynd sacrifices herself in exchange for Bond's life, as he later finds out from M. Bond subsequently finds and captures White.\n\nAlong with M, Bond interrogates Mr. White regarding his organisation, Quantum. M's bodyguard, Mitchell, a double agent, attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond traces the organisation to Haiti and a connection to environmentalist Dominic Greene.\n\nBond uncovers a plot between Greene and an exiled Bolivian General, Medrano, to put Medrano in power in Bolivia while Quantum are given a monopoly to run the water supply to the country. Bond ascertains Quantum are damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to force the price up. Bond attacks the hotel where Greene and Medrano are finalising their plans and leaves Greene stranded in the desert with only a tin of engine oil to drink. Bond then finds Vesper Lynd's former lover and member of Quantum, Yusef Kabira.\n\nAfter an operation in Istanbul ends in disaster, Bond is missing and presumed to be dead. In the aftermath, questions are raised over M's ability to run the Secret Service, and she becomes the subject of a government review over her handling of the situation. The Service itself is attacked, prompting Bond's return to London. His presence assists MI6's investigation in uncovering a lead, and Bond is sent to Shanghai and Macau in pursuit of a mercenary named Patrice. There, he establishes a connection to Raoul Silva, a former MI6 agent who was captured and tortured by Chinese agents. Blaming M for his imprisonment, he sets in motion a plan to ruin her reputation before murdering her. Bond saves M and attempts to lure Silva into a trap, and while he is successful in repelling Silva's assault, M is mortally wounded. Bond returns to active duty under the command of the new M, Gareth Mallory.\n\nIn the aftermath of Raoul Silva's attack on MI6, a cryptic message sets in motion events that will see James Bond come face-to-face with the sinister organisation known as \"Spectre\". As Gareth Mallory, the newly appointed M, continues fighting political pressures that threaten the future of MI6, Bond follows a trail from Mexico to Austria and Morocco as he is drawn into a confrontation with an enemy from his past; one who holds a dangerous secret that will force him to question the value of everything he has fought to protect.\n\nThe Eon-produced films have a combined gross of nearly $7 billion, and constitute the fourth-highest-grossing film series, behind \"Star Wars\", \"Harry Potter\" films and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\nThe Bond films have been nominated for a number of awards throughout their fifty-year history, with most films winning an award; these include successes at the British Academy Film Awards, Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards. In addition, in 1982 Albert R. Broccoli received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.\n\n\n"}

The most widely accepted theory is that the story is of Incan origin and was preserved through oral tradition until it was adapted for theatrical presentation in colonial times.\n\n\"Ollantay\" was first published in 1857 by Johann Jakob von Tschudi, in Quechua and German. The first Spanish version appeared in Lima in 1868, published by José Sebastián Barranca and subtitled \"The tribulations of a father and the generosity of a king\" (\"Los rigores de un padre y la generosidad de un rey\"); since then different versions have been published in a variety of languages.\n\nIt was first assumed that Antonio Valdés, priest of Sicuani, was the author of \"Ollantay\". English historian Clements R. Markham proposed this in the 19th century, and many others assumed it to be correct, including Dr. Raúl Porras Barrenechea. However, this theory of authorship has two major shortcomings: (1) there is no direct documentation indicating such an origin; (2) Valdés is not known to have written any other piece of literature or any other historical work. It seems more likely that this priest's contribution was limited to simply copying decaying manuscripts that he encountered in La Paz or other cities.\n\nIt was also suggested that the author was Justo Pastor Justiniani, but evidence later surfaced indicating that he served only as a copyist. Similarly, Juan Espinoza Medrano (aka El Lunarejo), a celebrated mestizo writer of the 17th century, was also considered a possible author. The lack of any documentary evidence supporting these possibilities has been taken to indicate a more likely pre-colonial origin for the play.\n\nThree hypotheses have emerged regarding the origin of \"Ollantay\":\n\nThere are six original copies of this play. One is from around 1770 and attributed to the priest Antonio Valdés, and is held in the Convent of Santo Domingo in Cuzco, Peru. Two are believed to be derived from this one, written by Dr. Justo Pastor Justiniani and Justo Apu Sahuaraura Inca, and held in the General Archive of the Nation of Peru and the National Library of Peru, respectively. Two others are found in the Dominican Convert of Cuzco, and the third was published by Johann Jakob von Tschudi on the basis of a manuscript with origins in La Paz, Bolivia.\n\n\"Ollantay\" is divided into three acts. It is written predominantly in octosyllable verse alternating with hendecasyllable verse, and contains both blank verse and assonant rhyme.\n\nA general of the Incan armies, Ollantay is a warrior of commoner origin that has been decorated and elevated to the nobility in return for his service to the empire. He falls in love with Cusi Coyllur (or Kusi Quyllur, \"happy star\"), the daughter of the Inca ruler Pachacutec, but this love is prohibited due to his commoner background. Nevertheless, blinded by love, he pursues a secret relationship with Cusi Coyllur, a secret shared only with the Queen Ccoya Anahuarqui.\n\nDespite ominous omens from the Incan high priest, Ollantay decides to ask the Incan king for his daughter's hand. Pachacutec, reminding Ollantay of his humble origins, reproaches Ollantay for his audacity and angrily expels him from the court. Cusi Coyllur is then imprisoned in the Acllahuasi (\"house of chosen women\") where she is to expiate her sins; there she gives birth to a baby girl, fruit of her love with Ollantay, that she names Ima Sumac (\"how beautiful\").\n\nOllantay, on learning that Cusi Coyllur is no longer in the palace, believes that she has been murdered and decides to leave the imperial capital Cusco together with his servant and confidant Piqui Chaqui (\"flea foot\"). He threatens to one day return and destroy Cusco, then flees to the city which carries his name, Ollantaytambo, where he and his followers arm themselves and prepare for battle.\n\nThe Incan ruler Pachacutec orders his general Rumi Nawi (\"Stone-eyed\") to gather forces and march to confront Ollantay. Ollantay sends his general Orqo Waranka (\"A thousand mountains\") to ambush Rumi Nawi in a mountain pass, defeating Rumi's forces but allowing him to escape. Other battles ensue. Ten years later Pachacutec dies without having defeated Ollantay, and his son Tupac Yupanqui succeeds him.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Acllahuasi, Cusi Coyllur has endured hardship at the hands of Mama Caca (\"Stone Mother\") but also found an ally in Pitu Salla (\"Twinned Love\"), who has raised Cusi's daughter Ima Sumac as her own. When Ima accidentally discovers her true heritage, she proposes to go to the new Incan king and ask for clemency for her mother.\n\nAt the same time, new Incan ruler Tupac Yupanqui resolves to finally defeat and capture Ollantay, and sends Rumi Nawi, who promises to redeem his earlier failure. Rumi Nawi employs a deceptive plan: he presents himself at the gates of Ollantaytambo covered in wounds, pretending that the new Incan ruler has abused him and suggesting that he would like to join Ollantay's rebellion. When the gates are opened, Rumi Nawi's men capture Ollantay, Orqo Waranka, and other rebels without resistance, eventually bringing them to Cusco to face Tupac Yupanqui's judgement. After consultation with his advisors and his generals, Tupac condemns the prisoners to death, but then reverses himself at the last minute and not only pardons them, but decides to give them high-ranking posts in the empire. Ollantay is named the senior general and deputy of the Inca ruler, while Orqo Waranka is named ruler of the state of Antisuyu.\n\nSoon afterwards, Ima Sumac enters the imperial palace to ask for clemency for her imprisoned mother. Although Tupac doesn't yet know whom this is, he takes an interest in the case and together with Ollantay goes to the Acllahuasi. There they find a woman with very long hair and a ghostly appearance that Tupac finally recognizes as his sister in a moment of anagnorisis. Cusi Coyllur tells her story, and a magnanimous Tupac Yupanqui frees her and immediately gives her hand to Ollantay, ending the Incan drama on a happy note.\n\n"}

In 1985 he worked as a stand-in for Renato Pozzetto in the movie \"È arrivato mio fratello\". Immediately after, he had a small part in \"Grandi magazzini\" and performed in many commercials. In 1987 in \"Soldati – 365 all’alba,\" he played a gay recruit. Thanks to his expressive skills and to his surreal acting, similar to the already mentioned Renato Pozzetto, Ghislandi has been often been asked to play roles as character actor, working both in the cinema and on television, without until recently getting lead roles. He boasts roles in important films like \"Il muro di gomma\" of Marco Risi, \"I mitici – Colpo gobbo a Milano\" of Carlo Vanzina, \"Vajont\" and \"Porzûs\" of Renzo Martinelli and, recently, was one of the actors chosen by Leonardo Pieraccioni in his successful movies (\"Il principe e il pirata\", \"Il paradiso all’improvviso\" and \"Ti amo in tutte le lingue del mondo\").\nPietro Ghislandi is known to the general public for being the one and only Italian ventriloquist.

Richeux became a theatrical proprietor, leasing the Ramsgate Victoria Pavilion from 1906, while Agnes Richeux leased the Artillery Theatre, Woolwich, from 1909. After Richeux's death, his widow married, in 1914, the theatre manager Frank Rolison Littler (1879–1940), who adopted the five children, all of whom took his surname.\nThe younger son Emile, and one of the daughters, Blanche, also went into theatrical management.\n\nWith Blanche, Littler started a theatrical career in 1927, assembling small companies for provincial tours. After a stint as resident manager of his parents' theatre in Woolwich, he became an independent theatre owner in 1931, buying two theatres in Leicester. The following year he married a widow, Annie Leonora Maclachlan, an actress, professionally known as Norah Delaney. There were no children of the marriage. Over the following years he bought theatres in Manchester and Norwich. His first London productions were pantomimes at the Coliseum, the Prince's, and Drury Lane.\n\nLittler's West End shows included \"Glamorous Night\" (1936), \"Brigadoon\" (1950); \"Carousel\", (1951); \"Guys and Dolls\" (1953, \"Can-Can\" (1954), \"The Black and White Minstrel Show\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof \" (both 1966). He presented more than 200 pantomimes in the regions, but unlike his younger brother, Emile, he played no part in writing any of his pantomimes, and concentrated wholly on the business side of the theatre.\n\nLittler was chairman and managing director of three major theatre groups, chairman of a fourth (Moss Empires). From the beginning of commercial television in the UK, he was a major shareholder in Associated Television. He was a member of the council of the Theatrical Managers' Association, and vice-president of the boards of the Society of West End Theatre Managers, Denville Home for Aged Actors and Actresses and the Variety Artistes' Benevolent Fund. He served on the boards of the South Bank Theatre and the Royal Opera House.\n\nIn 1957, Littler was appointed CBE.

{"id": "1547090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1547090", "title": "Pronuntiatio", "text": "Pronuntiatio\n\nPronuntiatio was the discipline of delivering speeches in Western classical rhetoric. It is one of the five canons of classical rhetoric (the others being inventio, dispositio, elocutio, and memoria) that concern the crafting and delivery of speeches. In literature the equivalent of ancient \"pronuntiatio\" is the recitation of epics (Aris. Po. 26.2.).\n\nAs with \"memoria\", the canon that dealt with the memorization of speeches, \"pronuntiatio\" was not extensively written about in Classical texts on rhetoric. Its importance declined even more, once the written word became the focus of rhetoric, although after the eighteenth century it again saw more interest in the works of men such as Gilbert Austin.\n\nRhetoricians laid down guidelines on the use of the voice and gestures (\"actio\") in the delivery of oratory. There were instructions on the proper modulation of the voice (volume and pitch), as well as the phrasing, pace, and emphasis of speech. Also covered were the physical aspects of oration: stance, gestures, posture, and facial expressions. There was also the concept of \"exercitatio\" (or practice exercises) that enabled speakers to both memorize their speeches and practice their delivery.\n\nThis excerpt from Quintilian's \"Institutio oratoria\" provides an example of the types of advice provided by rhetoricians:\n\nWhile the content, structure, and style of oration were (and continue to be) the most important elements of oratory, effective delivery enhances its persuasive power, and poor delivery detracts greatly from its intended effect.\n\nDelivery is based on the technology of the times.\nDuring Cicero's time, delivery was predominantly speaking. Written delivery developed because of the written language, and now delivery is both spoken and written. Technology has taken away the distinctions between written and oral delivery.\nWritten discourse did not become important until reading became more common. Because the ancients did not use punctuation, their writing consisted of one long stream of words called \"scriptio continua\". \nDuring the editing process, modern rhetors must go through three stages: correctness rule, formatting, and presentation. \nWriters face more problems than speakers because they must be conscious of spelling, punctuation, and grammar. \nPunctuation is useful in written discourse because it marks the end of a thought and allows the reader to pause and process the information.\nVisual rhetoric focuses on images and how words function as images.\nThe delivery of ocular demonstration is the use of words to produce mental images in the audience. Textual presentation allows the writer to grab the reader's attention before actually reading the text based on the appearance of the text. The invention of word processors has allowed writers to enhance the appearance of their text and use effects to put emphasis on certain words or thoughts.\n\"Delivery\" refers not only to written or spoken language, but also to photographs, paintings, or movies.\n\n\n"}

In the capital, Yaoundé the main area of prostitution is the neighbourhood of Mini Ferme. UNAIDS estimate there are 112,000 sex workers in the country.\n\nCameroon attracts sex tourism from the West, especially for child prostitution. The Cameroonian government has attempted to stop this trade by agreeing to multilateral agreements such as charters against sex tourism, like signing up with the Universal Federation of Travels Agents Associations (UFTAA).\n\nSection 343 of the Criminal Code criminalises \"Whoever, of either sex, engages habitually for gain, in sexual intercourse with others.\" The punishment is imprisonment of 6 months to 5 years and a fine. As 'habitual' is difficult to prove, this law is rarely enforced. The same section also prohibits solicitation.\n\nSection 294 of the code criminalises \"Whoever procures, aids or facilitates another person's prostitution, or shares in the proceeds of another person's prostitution, whether habitual or otherwise, or who is subsidised by and person engaging in prostitution.\" The punishment is imprisonment of 6 months to 5 years and a fine, however is there is coercion involved, a minor is involved (under 21) or if he is the manager, owner or otherwise in control of an establishment where prostitution takes place, the punishment is doubled.\n\nSection 361 of the code criminalised adultery for both sexes. Married prostitutes and clients therefore both commit an offence, but this is rarely enforced.\n\nLaw enforcement is sometimes corrupt. Sex worker report being arrested for not carrying an identification card and having to pay a bribe to be released. Sexual assaults, rape and having unprotected sex with officers to be released have also been reported.\n\nAs with other sub-Saharan African countries, HIV is a problem. Sex workers are one of the high risk groups. Access to health care and antiretroviral (ARTs) medicines for sex workers has improved. UNAIDs reported that in 2016 the estimated HIV prevalence amongst sex workers was 24.3%.\n\nIn 2005, American biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, proposed carrying out clinical tests of a new antiretroviral drug on prostitutes in Douala. These trials were opposed, including by anti-AIDS activist group ACT UP.\n\nCameroon is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Child traffickers often use the promise of education or a better life in the city to convince rural parents to give their children over to an intermediary, who then exploits the children in sex trafficking; traffickers also kidnap victims, as heightened public awareness of trafficking has led parents to be less willing to give their children to intermediaries. Sometimes relatives subject children to sex trafficking within the country. Homeless children and orphans are especially vulnerable to trafficking. Teenagers and adolescents from economically disadvantaged families are often lured to cities by the prospect of employment but are subjected to sex trafficking.\n\nCameroonian women and men are lured to Europe and other regions by fraudulent internet marriage proposals or offers of well-paying jobs, and subsequently are subjected to forced prostitution. Cameroonians from disadvantaged social strata, rural areas, and students are increasingly exploited in sex trafficking in the Middle East, especially Kuwait and Lebanon, as well as in Europe, including Finland, the United States, and multiple African countries, including Nigeria. Some Cameroonian women reported being recruited for domestic work in Kuwait but sold at “slave shops” upon arrival for sex trafficking. Trafficking networks typically involve destination-country recruitment agencies that use Cameroonian intermediaries to fraudulently recruit fellow Cameroonians for work abroad. Reports suggest local awareness-raising activities targeting fraudulent recruitment have caused intermediaries to operate with greater discretion, often directing victims to travel to the Middle East through neighbouring countries, including Nigeria. Some evidence indicates Cameroonian trafficking networks in Morocco force women into prostitution. Cameroonian women also transit Morocco en route to Europe, where they are often forced into prostitution by European trafficking networks.\n\nThe government incorporated its 2011 anti-trafficking law into the penal code as Section 342-1 “Trafficking and Slavery of Persons.” The government published the penal code in French and English, the two official languages of the government. The French version defines “trafficking in persons” (“la traite de personnes”) in line with the 2000 UN TIP Protocol, whereas the English version defines “trafficking in persons” to require movement. In addition, although the English version does not define “exploitation,” its definition of “slavery in persons” does not require movement and criminalizes most forms of human trafficking. Contrary to international law, both versions require the use of threat, fraud, deception, force, or other forms of coercion in sex trafficking crimes against children. Section 342-1 prescribes penalties of 10 to 20 years imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 to one million CFA francs (FCFA) ($80 $1,608) for “la traite de personnes”/“slavery in persons.” There are enhanced penalties if the trafficking victim is 15 years old or younger, if a weapon is used, or if the victim sustains serious injuries as a result of being subjected to trafficking.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Cameroon as a 'Tier 2' country.\n"}

TVS was founded by Daniel Diez Castillo in 1993 and is located in the small town of San Pablo de Yao, in the Buey Arriba territory. This small community inhabits 32, 000 people and most are coffee growers and/or producers. The focus of TVS is to acknowledge and give voice to the farmers in the mountain ranges. TVS is preserving the culture of this small community and “connecting them to the broader cultural life of Cuba \nTVS promotes awareness of the lives of those living in the Sierra Maestra through the form of art. TVS uses art to speak about the community's needs, beliefs, identity and to find “solutions to problems” in the region. TVS received national recognition on January 15, 1993 when institutions came together to sponsor and support TVS. UNESCO provided additional funding and support. The Cuban government supplied staff and training for employers and volunteers through the ICRT.\n\nTelevisión Serrana was founded to \"rescue the culture of \"campesino\" communities\" and to foster communication between communities, particularly those in the mountainous region of the Sierra Maestra. Through the exchange of information, TVS hopes to identify solutions to common problems between these communities. Furthermore, TVS aims to affirm the identity of the people of the Sierra Maestra during a time of increased globalism.\n\nThe project of TV Serrana began in 1993 by Daniel Diez Castillo. Castillo was a television producer in Havana, Cuba from The Cuban National Broadcasting Channel (ICRT). When Castillo left Havana, Cuba was in the “Periodo Especial” or Special Period. This was the economic crisis that followed after the fall of the Soviet Union. Castillo went east towards the region of the Sierra Maestra. The Sierra Maestra is known for its amazing mountains and the men who came across it. Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and many other rebels organized themselves to fight against Fulgencio Batista. Due to the mountainous terrain, the Sierra Maestra became isolated from other parts of Cuba. Before Castillo came along, the rest of Cuba portrayed Sierra Maestra as the \"producers of staples; nothing was said about their dreams, their conflicts, their culture\" \n. Daniel Diez Castillo then wanted to film the real Sierra Maestra, his goal was to “make a collective form of cinema, to produce movies and documentaries narrating the history and identity of people living that area, to create a form of partaken communication far from the capital” \n. TV Serrana was first funded by UNESCO, but after time they were able to self-fund its own programs.\n\nTools used for Television Serrana are simple, it includes: \"VHS, Super VHS and Beta nonprofessional cameras and editing equipment\". The crew of TVS consists of “three cameramen, three directors, two editors, two producers, two sound assistants and three drivers who also set up the lighting when needed. One main feature used in TVS are video letters. A video letter is a reportage that captures the people of Sierra Maestra’s experiences, lives and dreams through their own perspective. Video letters are not edited by the media, but they show the true reality and struggles of the people. Video letters are also important because they are seen by others and are used for responding. They create communication between boundaries and is a great factor in Television Serrana.\n\nThe program aims to promote self-sustaining activities, TV Serrana provides programs and opportunities to the people living within the villages. A majority of the training workshops were given through El Centro de Estudios para la Comunicación Comunitaria (CECC), created in 1996. TV Serrana along with the help of supporting institutions provides training and services through seminars that help locals with communication and community building skills through the use of media. These programs offer lessons to villagers \"willing to use video in their communities as a tool for participatory development and democratic communication\". Other services accessible through TVS is the ability to transfer and copy video-cassettes from and to Beta VHS and S-VHS which allow people within the communities to share their stories.\n\nTelevision Serrana has been a growing success, but there were difficulties in the beginning. One of the problems of TVS was the lack of experience many of the crew members had. Most had to take training sessions on how to work media products and running programs within the community. As mentioned before, the trainees had to learn how to do video letters and how to transfer and copy video-cassettes to and from Beta VHS. The greatest of constraints for the project was gaining the trust and confidence needed by the local communities. Many of the villagers were skeptical of the programs intentions, which created difficulties to gain the support from locals. The people of Sierra Maestra felt the newcomers were intruding onto their land, interrupting their daily lives and thought the intentions of the crew were to give the locals a bad image. The crew had to show the people that they came with positive objectives and wanted to help the communities.\n"}

The plays within the manuscript roughly follow the chronology of the Bible and so were believed to be a cycle, which is now considered not to be the case.\nThis play gained its name because in the manuscript it immediately follows another nativity play involving the shepherds. In fact, it has been hypothesized that the second play is a revision of the first. It appears that the two shepherd plays were not intended to be performed together since many of the themes and ideas of the first play carry over to the second one. In both plays it becomes clear that Christ is coming to Earth to redeem the world from its sins. Although the underlying tone of \"The Second Shepherd's Play\" is serious, many of the antics that occur among the shepherds are extremely farcical in nature.\n\nThe biblical portion of the play, a retelling of the Visitation of the Shepherds, comes only after a longer, invented story that mirrors it, in which the shepherds, before visiting the holy baby outside in a manger, must first rescue one of their sheep that has been hidden in a cradle indoors by a comically evil sheep-stealing couple. Once they have discovered and punished the thieves, the storyline switches to the familiar one of the three shepherds being told of the birth of Christ by an angel, and going to Bethlehem to offer the true Child gifts.\n\nAt the start of the play, Coll, the first shepherd (\"primus pastor\") arrives in a field, invoking God in anachronistic terms (referring, as the shepherds will do throughout the play, to the life and death of Christ even though at this point of the play Christ has not yet been born) complaining about the (typically English) cold weather and about his poverty and the arrogance of local gentry. He begins by saying, \"Lord, what these weders are cold! And I am ill happyed\" which translates as \"Lord [God], the weather is cold and I am ill prepared/clothed.\" Gib, the second shepherd, arrives without seeing Coll and complains first about the weather and then about the plight of married men, himself included, with bawdy speculation about the lives of men with more than one wife and advice to \"young men of wooing\" to \"Be well war of weding\" (wary of marriage). He paints a portrait of his wife as a loud, heavy-drinking, alternately abusive and sentimentally pious, whale-sized woman. \"By him that died for us all, I would I had run til I had lost her!\" at which point he is startled by Coll. They confer about where Daw, a third, young, lazy and mischievous, shepherd, has gotten to, at which point Daw arrives complaining about employers, hunger, and about recent floods which he compares to Noah's flood.\n\nMak, a local good-for-nothing and well-known thief, arrives and pretends to be a yeoman from a lord. Although they recognize him from the start, he insults and threatens them by saying that he will have them flogged. When they threaten him, he pretends not to have known who they were. Mak tries to gain sympathy from the shepherds by explaining how his wife is a lazy drunk who gives birth to too many children. Invoking Christ and Pontius Pilate, Mak agrees to camp with the shepherds, and feigns to lie down among them. However, once they have fallen asleep he casts a spell to make sure they will not wake up and then sneaks off to steal one of their sheep. He heads back to his cottage and trades insults with Gill, his wife, who firmly believes that Mak will be hanged for the theft and comes up with a plan for hiding the sheep – she will put it in an empty cradle and pretend that it is her newborn child, and that she is loudly, painfully in labor with its twin, so that the shepherds will quickly give up any search.\n\nMak sneaks back among the shepherds and pretends to awaken along with them. They head off to take account of their sheep while Mak heads home to prepare. With despair at their catastrophic ill fortune, the shepherds realize a sheep is missing and go to search Mak's house. They are initially fooled by Mak and Gill's ruse despite Gill going so far as to say that if she's lying she'll eat the child in her cradle (as she indeed plans to). The shepherds leave defeated, but realize that they have failed to bring any gifts to the \"baby\", and go back. When they remove the swaddling clothes they recognize their sheep, but decide not to kill Mak but instead roll him in canvas and throw him up and down, punishing him until they are exhausted.\n\nWhen they have left Mak's cottage, the biblical story proper begins – the Angel appears and tells them to go to \"Bedlam\" (Bethlehem) to see the Christ child. They wonder at the event, chastising each other for their collective delay, and then go to the manger where Mary (Mother of Jesus) welcomes them and receives their praise for her mildness. They each address the Child in turn, beginning by praising His authority and His creation of all things in tones of reverence and awe, but each comically shifting mid-speech to cooing, gushing baby talk, since they are addressing an adorable baby, who Coll, Gib, and Daw respectively give \"a bob of cherries,\" a bird, and a ball (\"Have and play thee withal, and go to the tennis!\") The shepherds rejoice at their salvation, all thoughts of hardship and complaint vanished, and leave singing in unison.\n\nThe name \"Wakefield Master\" is a title given by Charles Mills Gayley to an unknown author of at least five of the plays that are found in the Wakefield Mystery Plays. In 1903, Gayley and Alwin Thaler published an anthology of criticism and dramatic selections entitled \"Representative English Comedies.\" It had long been believed that the Towneley Play was a mediocre work that showed extensive borrowing from other sources but containing vibrant and exciting material, apparently by one author, who was responsible for four or five complete pageants and extensive revisions. Gayley refers to this person as the \"master\" (with a lowercase m) in the book. Then, in a 1907 article, Gayley amended this to \"The Wakefield Master\", the name which is still frequently used (Wakefield Cycle Authorship). Of the 32 plays found in the manuscript, tradition has attributed \"The Second Shepherd's Play\" to the \"Wakefield Master\", along with \"Noah\", \"The First Shepherd's Play\", \"Herod the Great\", and \"The Buffeting of Christ.\" A sixth play, \"The Killing of Abel\" is also thought to have been heavily influenced by him if not exclusively written by him, along with \"The Last Judgment,\" of which he contributed to at least half. Many of the other plays in the manuscript have a few stanzas that were most likely written by him as well.\n\nAlthough nothing is known about the author, or the origins of the plays, it is agreed by several scholars that they date sometime between 1400-1450. Because of his influence in most of the Wakefield plays, it is possible he was brought into Wakefield with the purpose of editing and reworking the several plays that were already written, and did such a successful job that he was kept on to write several other plays afterwards. The plays he wrote might have replaced plays that were taken from York and it is believed that he is a contemporary to the \"York Master\", another unnamed playwright who produced several other influential plays during the same era.\n\nSome question the existence of one \"Wakefield Master\", and propose that multiple authors could have written in the Wakefield Stanza. However, scholars and literary critics find it useful to hypothesize a single talent behind them, due to the unique poetic qualities of the works ascribed to him.\n\nThe plays of the \"Wakefield Master\" are identified by their unique stanza form, which is nine lines rhyming a b c c c b with internal rhymes in the first four lines.\n\nThis stanza format is the primary evidence critics use to identify what has been written by him. Along with his unique stanzas, the \"Wakefield Master's\" plays are also characterized by their emphasis on characterization that delves into the rural contemporary life of the characters. Using modern day technology which included plows, mills, and forges, as well as colloquial speech amongst the dialogue between the characters, the stories exemplified early traits of realism that would have made the stories more relevant for the audience of that time period.\n\nThe author also used contrasting dialects in \"The Second Shepherd's Play\", in the part where Mak pretends to be a yeoman. The regular dialect is Northern-midlands, with Mak's deceptive dialect being from the south. Two different studies (Trusler, and Cawley) on the main dialect certified that these plays did come from Wakefield.\n\nDepending on the area of the performances, the plays were performed in the middle of the street, on pageant wagons in the streets of great cities (this was inconvenient for the actors because the small stage size made stage movement difficult), in the halls of nobility, or in the round in amphitheatres, as suggested by current archaeology in Cornwall and the southwest of England. All medieval stage production was temporary and expected to be removed upon the completion of the performances. Actors, predominantly male, typically wore long, dark robes. Medieval plays, such as the Wakefield cycle or the Digby Magdalene, featured lively interplay between two distinct areas—the wider spaces in front of the raised staging areas, and the elevated areas themselves (called, respectively, the platea and the locus). Also typical was to have the actors would move between these locations in order to suggest scene changes, rather than remain stationary and have the scene change around them as is typically done in modern theater.\n\nThe staging of this play likely required two sets. It is suggested that the first stage is composed of Mak's house. In Mak's house, many of the farcical actions occur (for example, this is the location of where the sheep was \"born\"). The other stage is where the holy manger and the religious iconography would occur. This is more than likely where the angel appears and where the Shepherds go to visit Mary. These two different stages would allow the audience to easily see the parallels between farcical and serious.\n\nAlthough Albert C. Baugh complained of the combination of low farce and high religious intent in the play, the unity is a distinctive feature of the play, where the Mak-subplot has been shown to have numerous analogues in world folklore. Wallace H. Johnson theorized that the union of a complete and independent farce with a complete and independent Nativity play resulted from the accumulation of years of horseplay and ad-libbing in rehearsal. Some have seen the folk-origins of the story as contributing to an extended reflection on class-struggle and solidarity in light of immediate and eternal realities\n\nMaynard Mack explains that this play is often categorized as simple and containing little artistic merit. What begins to emerge in Mack's article is that he feels that the play is not only sophisticated, but the comedic aspects are there to enhance the rest of the text. He explains that in examining the text as two separate entities, a viewer would be doing the text a great injustice; rather, one should view them as a collection whole in order to understand the importance of exaggeration and the idea of a terrible beauty.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45617112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45617112", "title": "Wolfenstein: The Old Blood", "text": "Wolfenstein: The Old Blood\n\nWolfenstein: The Old Blood is an action-adventure first-person shooter video game developed by MachineGames and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was released on 5 May 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game is a stand-alone title in the \"Wolfenstein\" series and a prequel to 2014's \"\", set in an alternate-history 1946. The single-player story follows war veteran William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz and his efforts to discover the locations of a Nazi compound. Development began in 2014, soon after the release of \"The New Order\".\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective and its levels are navigated on foot. The story is arranged in chapters which players complete in order to progress, separated into two interconnected campaigns. The game features a variety of weapons, including pistols, shotguns, and explosives, most of which can be dual wielded. A cover system is also present; players lean in and out of cover instead of the more common system where players lock into cover.\n\n\"Wolfenstein: The Old Blood\" received generally positive reviews. Many critics praised the game's intense firefights, intriguing locations, and the balance between stealth and action. Many critics disliked the game's story, however, with most reviewers saying that it was the weakest part of the game and a step back compared to \"The New Order\"s story, which was highly complimented.\n\n\"Wolfenstein: The Old Blood\" changes little from the basic gameplay of \"The New Order\". As such, it is an action-adventure shooter game played from a first-person perspective. To progress through the story, players take on enemies while navigating throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections, \"health\" and \"armor\", that regenerate. If an entire section is lost, players must find and use a health pack or body armor piece, to replenish the missing health.\n\nPlayers use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, and may run, jump and occasionally swim to navigate through the locations. Melee attacks can be used to silently take down enemies without being detected. Alternatively, players can ambush enemies, which will result in an intense firefight between the two parties. Enemy types vary; standard Nazi human soldiers, which vary in strength, robot-like characters known as Supersoldaten (Super Soldiers), giant mechanical dogs known as Panzerhunds, zombie-like Nazi soldiers and civilians known as Shamblers, and vicious dogs are some of the enemies players will encounter.\n\nIn combat, a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which can be used as a tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows the player to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. \"The Old Blood\" adds various weapons that were not featured in \"The New Order\", such as a steel pipe. The steel pipe is one of the biggest additions to the game; it consists of two small steel pipes which can be connected together to make a larger pipe. Both pipe states can be used as a melee attacks (each with their own animations) and in specific circumstances. The two small pipes, called \"Pipes\" in the weapon inventory, can be used to climb rock walls, and the large pipe, called \"Pipe\" in the inventory, is used to break open weak environmental surfaces. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options—they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies.\n\nAs with \"The New Order\", players can complete \"Perks\"; each Perk has a task the player can complete. Perks encourage the player to change their play style on the fly; collecting \"helmets\", getting silent kills, killing specific enemies a select number of times, getting a set number of kills with a specific weapon, and getting kills via explosives are some of the objectives. Once a Perk's task is complete, the player unlocks a bonus, such as more overall health or armor, more ammunition for a certain weapon, or the ability to gain health after a silent takedown. Various collectibles are also scattered throughout the levels; concept art, character models and bios, notes, which tell small side stories of the game, and gold bars are some of the collectibles.\n\nOther modes in the game differing from the main chapters are Challenge Arenas and Nightmare Levels. Challenge Arenas unlock as the player progresses through the story and are accessed from the main menu. Being a basic arena battle mode, players fight waves of enemies to obtain a Bronze, Silver, or Gold metal. Nightmare Levels are accessed by finding and interacting with a bed that is hidden in each chapter. There's a hidden easter egg where players can play \"Wolfenstein 3D\"; the player moves through pixelated hallways, mostly equipped with just a pistol, fighting Nazi soldiers. The objective is to find a key that unlocks an elevator.\n\n\"Wolfenstein: The Old Blood\" takes place in an alternate history 1946, just prior to the prologue of \"Wolfenstein: The New Order\", with O.S.A. agents William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz (Brian Bloom) and Richard Wesley (taking up the codename Agent One) on a mission to infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein and obtain a top secret folder containing the location of \"SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer\" Wilhelm \"Deathshead\" Strasse from the castle's commander, Nazi archeologist and \"Standartenführerin\" Helga von Schabbs. Entering the castle disguised as Schutzstaffel officers, B.J. and Wesley fail to find the folder and are captured by Helga's lieutenant, \"Sturmbannführer\" Rudi Jäger, a massive and sadistic dog trainer who feeds captured prisoners to his mechanically augmented canines. While Wesley is dragged away by Rudi for interrogation, B.J. succeeds in escaping the prison cells and fighting his way through the castle. B.J. eventually locates Wesley strapped to an electric chair used by the Nazis for torture. Before B.J. can rescue Wesley, Rudi activates the chair and electrocutes him. Jager then feeds Wesley's dead body to his prized albino dog, Greta, and straps B.J. into the chair, shocking him as well. B.J. breaks free, injures Rudi, and kills Greta.\n\nEscaping the castle, B.J. travels to the nearby village of Paderborn and meets up with the local German resistance leader, Ludwig Kessler, as well as Kessler's assistant Annette, a young Jewish girl whom Kessler is sheltering from the Nazis. Kessler's tavern is attacked by Nazi forces led by Rudi, wearing an experimental suit of power armor, whom B.J. defeats and kills. B.J., Kessler, and Annette flee via rowboat to the village of Wulfburg, where Helga is conducting an archeological excavation attempting to find a hidden underground vault containing occult knowledge previously possessed by King Otto I.\n\nAfter meeting up with O.S.A. operative Pippa (codenamed Agent Two), B.J. disguises himself as a waiter and infiltrates the tavern where Helga is staying. Helga sees through B.J.'s disguise and captures him, but B.J. manages to escape during a massive earthquake caused by the Nazis opening the vault. The opening of the vault also releases a gas that causes anyone that dies within the vicinity of Wulfburg to reanimate as hostile, burning, zombies known as \"shamblers\". B.J. fights his way through the burning ruins of Wulfburg while fighting through the zombified Nazis and civilians who died in the earthquake. Agent Two is killed by a shambler, and B.J. has to kill her again when she reanimates as one. Attempting to return to Kessler and Annette, B.J. finds the two of them have gone into Wulfburg in an attempt to rescue Annette's companion, Katrin.\n\nB.J. finds Annette and Kessler separated by a collapsing bridge and stranded on opposite buildings, and the player is given the choice of traveling to Annette's building or Kessler's building. The person B.J. travels to will be rescued by him, while the other person will be killed by the shamblers. B.J. then travels to the Nazi excavation in pursuit of Helga, finally encountering her within King Otto's vault. There he finds the source of the zombie-creating gas, an undead giant known as 'The Monstrosity,' a creature created by King Otto's alchemists as a weapon of war, then sealed away by the king after deciding it was an abomination. Helga is initially successful in using Old High German commands to control the monster, but when she attempts to order it to eat B.J., the monster fatally wounds her instead. B.J. fights and kills The Monstrosity, then finally obtains the secret folder from a dying Helga. B.J. is extracted from Wulfburg by his friend Fergus, and the two of them embark from RAF Kinloss to assassinate Deathshead and end the war, while B.J. thinks about the nature of monsters and hopes that he can finally rest after this .\n\nThe existence of \"Wolfenstein: The Old Blood\" was first acknowledged by Bethesda Softworks on 4 March 2015, through the release of an announcement trailer. Footage of the game was showcased at PAX East on 6–7 March 2015. Though initially announced to only be available digitally, it was later confirmed that the game would also receive a physical retail release in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe development team initially planned to create a series of individual downloadable content (DLC) packs, but later decided to change this to a standalone expansion pack. When this decision was made, development on two of the DLC was already underway, and the team decided to merge the two DLC into one standalone game. During this process, some members of the team experimented with creating artwork of the game in the style of movie posters from the 1960s, resulting in the inspiration to make the game have a \"B movie vibe\", though the game also took inspiration from films such as \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967) and \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968). The development team's decision to make the game a prequel was to allow players to experience the game without playing previous titles in the series. It also allowed the team to explore concepts that were mentioned in \"The New Order\". For the game, the team aimed to focus on gameplay. \"It's something you can just play through and immediately have fun\", said executive producer Jerk Gustafsson. The team also tried to create different route possibilities within the combat spaces, offering a balance between stealth and action sequences.\n\nAt one point during the game, Blazkowicz encounters a group of inebriated Nazis singing in a tavern. Though the motion capture was performed by actors, the audio director requested for the voices to be performed by members of the development team; to achieve an accurate performance, members of the team learned some German, and became inebriated prior to recording.\n\nThe team initially planned to reuse assets from \"The New Order\" in \"The Old Blood\", but ultimately altered most assets in some way. Due to the team's focus on eighth generation consoles and PC, they were able to achieve some rendering updates, as well as the creation of larger and more detailed environments in the game. The game also intentionally included several references to \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\".\n\n\"Wolfenstein: The Old Blood\" makes use of an original score, composed by musician Mick Gordon, who also composed the for \"The New Order\". To create music with a style reflecting the game, Gordon performed with a string quartet, spending time manipulating a broken mandolin and cello. He also placed some items inside a piano, to create a unique sound.\n\n\"Wolfenstein: The Old Blood\" received \"generally favorable reviews\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n\"Destructoid\"'s Chris Carter praised the game for its brevity, saying that both episodes \"don't waste as much time as some missions in [\"The New Order\"]. Both Castle Wolfenstein and Wulfburg are expansive enough to justify an entire game.\" He also said that \"the development team does a good job of managing the pacing between stealth and action\". Carter said that Helga Von Schabbs is a character that kept him \"engaged\" throughout the game, that he \"slightly [preferred]\" \"The Old Blood\" over \"The New Order\", and that choosing to play the game is a \"no-brainer\".\n\n\"Polygon\"'s Justin McElroy complimented the game's action gameplay, stating that he liked the choice of weapons, the gunplay, and the mix of stealth and action, while being critical of the game for not having the components that made \"The New Order\" great. \"\"The Old Blood\" suggests B-movie camp\", McElroy said, \"there are barely any moments where the action slows down enough to develop the type of characters and motivation that charged the big combat set pieces in [\"The\"] \"New Order\"\".\n\nMarty Sliva of IGN complimented the game's stealth puzzles, saying, \"These scenes turn down the volume, but keep the tension high, as many enemies are able to tear you apart extremely quickly if you get caught.\" Sliva also \"appreciated\" the easter eggs referencing other Bethesda games, liked the firefights, which he called \"satisfying\", and praised the environment, which he said was \"interesting\". Sliva did however dislike the presence of zombies, the \"weak\" story, and having to manually pick up items. Sliva wrapped up his review by saying \"\"Wolfenstein: The Old Blood\" doubles down on blood and guts, but in doing so sacrifices some of its heart.\"\n\n\"PC Gamer UK\"'s Chris Thursten said, \"what was novel a year ago isn't necessarily novel now\". He was mostly positive of the game's action gunplay, calling it \"excellent\". He said the Challenge arenas are also a good addition that he'd like to see in future \"Wolfenstein\" games. Most negative comments were related to \"The New Order\", in Thursten's opinion, being superior to \"The Old Blood\". Thursten said ,\"Nothing in \"The Old Blood\" exceeds what was achieved in \"The New Order\", and there are moments when the two are uncannily similar\".\n\nGamesRadar+'s Andi Hamilton praised the game's shooting gameplay, calling it \"satisfying\", the \"strong\" pacing, the visuals, particularly the set pieces, which he called \"beautiful\", and the fact it's a standalone game, Hamilton said it \"works\". Hamilton did however call the game's story \"weak\" compared to \"The New Order\", and said certain stealth sections were \"rough\". Hamilton summarized his review by saying \"\"Wolfenstein: The Old Blood\" is another sterling effort from MachineGames, fast proving to be real players in the FPS genre. This add-on clearly has smaller scope than was found in \"The New Order\", keeping things much more 'down to Earth', but the core shooting experience that makes the reborn Wolfenstein such a pleasure to play remains perfectly intact. If you like shooting zombies and Nazis with extravagantly powerful weapons (and lets be honest here, who doesn’t?) this is well worth checking out.\"\n\nMatt Bertz of \"Game Informer\" said: \"Had \"The Old Blood\" been injected with more new blood, maybe it would have matched or surpassed the quality of \"The New Order\". But by over-relying on nostalgia to drive the experience, it's well-crafted fan service rather than an attempt to push the series in new directions. For a standalone expansion that's not an unforgivable offense, but we're excited to see what Machine Games can do with the series now that this genealogical exercise is flushed out of its system.\"\n\nIn Japan, where the Xbox One version was ported for release on 28 May 2015, followed by the PlayStation 4 version on 4 June 2015, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of two eights, one nine, and one eight for a total of 33 out of 40.\n\nTom Hoggins of \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the PS4 version four stars out of five and said, \"For those that have played through \"The New Order\" and are keen for more of its beefy action, this delivers around 7 hours of it for a decent price. I’d argue \"The Old Blood\" also makes a satisfying starter to \"The New Order\"’s more substantial meal if you haven’t yet had a taste. A well-priced piece of downloadable content that works equally well on either side of the main game? Clever.\" David Jenkins of \"Metro\" gave the same console version eight out of ten and called it \"A great follow-up to \"The New Order\", which cleverly reuses all of its best features and yet still finds time to add plenty of new elements of its own.\" Justin Clark of \"Slant Magazine\" gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it \"a wonderful palate cleanser, something to undo long-standing wrongs before diving in to a much deeper, gratifying installment. The conundrum is that the people who already know what MachineGames is capable of with this series have seen the future, and \"The Old Blood\" doesn't provide all that compelling a reason to return to the past.\" Christopher Byrd of \"The Washington Post\" gave the same console version an average review and said, \"The game’s B-movie vibe is evocative of the work of those skilled filmmakers who embrace the silly or even the self-consciously stupid.\" Steve Tilley of \"Toronto Sun\" similarly gave the same console version a mixed review and stated, \"\"The Old Blood\" is just OK. It’s a great deal for the price – as a $25 digital download via the PlayStation Store, the Xbox Games Store and Steam, it’s a rarity in an era when 25 bucks might get you a couple map packs’ worth of downloadable content – but I’ve discovered there’s such a thing as too old-school.\" Drew Toal of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the same console version a mixed review and said that it \"just feels a little gratuitous\". Ebenezer Samuel of \"New York Daily News\" gave the Xbox One version three stars out of five and called it \"a less weighty experience overall.\"\n\n"}
