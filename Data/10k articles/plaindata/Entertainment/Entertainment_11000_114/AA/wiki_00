Currently based in Hong Kong, it was held in Singapore since 1981 until disagreements between co-organisers Reed Exhibitions and Singapore Technologies in 2006 forced its relocation from 2007.\n\nAsian Aerospace was held at the old Paya Lebar Airport in Singapore when it was first hosted in 1981. Organised by ITF, a British organiser, it grew to become the third largest airshow in the world, and was touted by its organisers as the \"world’s second most influential airshow\" . ITF was subsequently acquired by Reed Exhibitions in 1982. Held once every two years, it boasted 759 exhibiting companies from 37 countries, a total of 26,814 trade visitors from 81 countries recorded, and trade deals amounting to USD3.52 billion were concluded in the 2004 event.\n\nThe largest edition of the show was held from 21 February to 24 February 2006, the 13th and final show in Singapore. Held jointly with several conferences including the Asia Pacific Security Conference (APSEC), the C4I Asia Conference (C4i Asia), the Asia Pacific Airline Training Symposium (APATS), the Asian Aerospace UAV Asia-Pacific Conference and the IATA/Asian Aerospace Aviation Summit, it featured a rebranded Asian Defense Technology military component. At show's end, it drew 940 exhibitors from 43 countries, 34,300 trade participants from 89 countries and concluded a record US15.2 billion in sales.\n\nFrom 2008, the show moved from Singapore as Reed Exhibitions could not agree with the Government of Singapore over development plans for a new 24-hectare permanent exhibition site in Changi. While Reeds was still in negotiations to source for a new location, the Singapore government announced its intentions to organise the Singapore Airshow from 2008 in the absence of Asian Aerospace. It was revealed on February 13, 2006 that Reed has chosen AsiaWorld-Expo at Hong Kong International Airport island, Lantau Island, Hong Kong as the new site, with the first relocated show to be held in 2007 to avoid clashing with the Singapore Airshow the following year.\n\nOn September 3, 2007 the 4-day Asian Aerospace International Expo and Congress kicked off in Hong Kong with 500 companies from 20 countries participating. The Airbus A380 was allowed to do a special flypast twice over the Victoria Harbour as part of the show. The Aircraft Interiors EXPO ASIA was held concurrently with the airshow, but the scaled-down show was without its military-related businesses due to political sensitivities in relation to China. Immediately prior to the event's commencement, Reeds announced over 500 exhibitors from over 20 countries and around 10,000 pre-registered trade visitors.\n\n"}

After reconciling with the injured Emelie, he jokingly puts the bear mask back on, and is shot by a bear hunter.\n\n\nThe film earned mainly positive reviews from critics. Ivan Kander of \"short of the week\" gave film the positive review said \"Edgerton isn’t trying to surprise you—he already pulled off that magic trick once with Spider. Instead, he’s reveling a bit in a sort of misanthropic playground. Our protagonist is a cartoon character of sorts—the Wile E. Coyote of cinematic schadenfreude. He’s always getting himself, and his loved ones, into the darndest, deadliest situations. And, all the while, we can’t help but laugh at his misfortune.\" David Brook of \"blue print review\" gave the film three and a half out of five stars and said \"A sequel to Spider, Bear basically replays the gag in a new setting. Predictable of course for this reason, but still funny and well produced.\" Another critic in his review said that \"Reviewing a film this short is going to be fairly similar to reviewing an advert, because and with so little time to build character or a world, it essentially comes down to did you did or did you didn’t like the punch. In this case, I did, it gave me a legitimate ‘ I didn’t see that coming’ moment, upon the fact that it was coolly put together and even pulls of a very impressive stunt. Not one I’ll remember for the rest of my days for sure, but an amusing distraction, which is exactly what I think it was designed to be.\"\n\nThe film received a honorable mention in the category \"Best narrative short film\" at the 12th International Cycling Film Festival 2017.\n\n\"Bear\" is a follow-up of Edgerton's 2007 short film \"Spider\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1228013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1228013", "title": "Bikutsi", "text": "Bikutsi\n\nBikutsi is a musical genre from Cameroon. It developed from the traditional styles of the Beti, or Ewondo, people, who live around the city of Yaoundé. It was popular in the middle of the 20th century in West Africa. It is primarily dance music.\n\nThe word 'bikutsi' literally means 'beat the earth' or 'let's beat the earth' (\"bi\"- indicates a plural, -\"kut\"- means 'to beat' and -\"chi\" means 'earth'.) The name indicates a dance that is accompanied by stomping the feet on the ground.\n\nBikutsi is characterised by an intense rhythm (3+3, with a strong \"two\" feel), though it is occasionally and its tempo is usually quarternote. it is played at all sorts of Beti gatherings, including parties, funerals and weddings.\n\nBeti gatherings fall into two major categories:\n\n\nA double sided harp with calabash amplification called the \"mvet\" is used during these ceremonies, by Beti storytellers, who are viewed as using the \"mvet\" as an instrument of God to educate the people. The Ekang phase is intensely musical, and usually lasts all night. There are poetic recitations accompanied by clapping and dancing, with interludes for improvised and sometimes obscene performances on the balafon (a type of xylophone). These interludes signal the shift to the bikutsi phase, which is much less strictly structured than Ekang. During bikutsi, women dance and sing along with the balafon, and lyrics focus on relationships, sexuality and the lives of famous people. These female choruses are an integral part of bikutsi, and their intense dancing and screams are characteristic of the genre. Traditional bikutsi was often ironic in its content, as many modern bikutsi songs still are.\n\nIn its modern form, bikutsi is very popular, and rivals makossa as the country's most renowned style.\n\nPopular bikutsi first appeared in the 1940s with the recording of Anne-Marie Nzie. Some twenty years later, the style was electrified with the addition of keyboards and guitars. The most popular performer of this period was Messi Me Nkonda Martin, frontman for Los Camaroes and known as \"the father of modern bikutsi music\". In an effort to translate the sound and spirit of traditional bikutsi music to more modern terms, Messi incorporated the sound of a balafon into the electric guitar by linking together the guitar strings with lengths of cotton cord. Played in this way, the electric guitar sounded similar to the balafon. The music itself, then, was only slightly altered, while the image and outside perception of bikutsi music was changed enormously. Other bands during this time, such as Les Vétérans, were also popular.\n\nInternational acclaim began in 1987 with the formation of Les Têtes Brûlées by Jean Marie Ahanda. The late guitarist of Les Têtes Brulées, Zanzibar, invented the trick of damping the strings of his guitar with a strip of foam rubber to produce the music's characteristic balafon-like thunk. (The balafon is a marimba-like instrument that is widely used in African folk music.) More modern performers include Jimmy Mvondo Mvelé and Mbarga Soukous.\n\nPresent-day bikutsi as performed by artists like Lady Ponce, K-Tino, Racine Sagath and Natascha Bizo is sometimes regarded as controversial. It has been criticised for the perceived sexual content of its lyrics and dancing style. In this respect bikutsi resembles mapouka from Côte d'Ivoire, which is also considered indecent by many Africans. The main difference is that present day bikutsi is still often performed by female artists who use it as a means of self-expression in a traditionally male-dominated society.\n\nThus a singer like K-Tino, self-styled \"femme du peuple\" (\"woman of the people\") sees herself as having an important part to play in the emancipation and liberation of the women of Cameroon.\n\nAmong the current crop of artists are Patou Bass and Ovasho Bens, the promoter of a dance and philosophy called \"zig zag\". His first album is composed not only of Cameroonian traditional rhythms but also West Indian zouk and Jamaican-style reggae.\n\nBikutsi has influenced Western musicians such as Paul Simon on his 1990 album \"The Rhythm of the Saints\".\n"}

{"id": "7165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7165", "title": "Cartoon", "text": "Cartoon\n\nA cartoon is a type of illustration, possibly animated, typically in a non-realistic or semi-realistic style. The specific meaning has evolved over time, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a \"cartoonist\", and in the second sense they are usually called an \"animator\".\n\nThe concept originated in the Middle Ages, and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting, fresco, tapestry, or stained glass window. In the 19th century, beginning in \"Punch\" magazine in 1843, cartoon came to refer – ironically at first – to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers. In the early 20th century, it began to refer to animated films which resembled print cartoons.\n\nA cartoon (from and —words describing strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a full-size drawing made on sturdy paper as a study or \"modello\" for a painting, stained glass, or tapestry. Cartoons were typically used in the production of frescoes, to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp plaster over a series of days (\"giornate\").\n\nSuch cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or \"pounced\" over a cartoon, held against the wall, would leave black dots on the plaster (\"pouncing\"). Cartoons by painters, such as the Raphael Cartoons in London, and examples by Leonardo da Vinci, are highly prized in their own right. Tapestry cartoons, usually colored, were followed with the eye by the weavers on the loom.\n\nIn print media, a cartoon is an illustration or series of illustrations, usually humorous in intent. This usage dates from 1843, when \"Punch\" magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages, particularly sketches by John Leech. The first of these parodied the preparatory cartoons for grand historical frescoes in the then-new Palace of Westminster. The original title for these drawings was \"Mr Punch's face is the letter Q\" and the new title \"cartoon\" was intended to be ironic, a reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of Westminster politicians.\n\nCartoons can be divided into gag cartoons, which include editorial cartoons, and comic strips.\n\nModern single-panel \"gag cartoons\", found in magazines, generally consist of a single drawing with a typeset caption positioned beneath, or—less often—a speech balloon. Newspaper syndicates have also distributed single-panel gag cartoons by Mel Calman, Bill Holman, Gary Larson, George Lichty, Fred Neher and others. Many consider \"New Yorker\" cartoonist Peter Arno the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself). The roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes Charles Addams, Charles Barsotti, and Chon Day.\n\nBill Hoest, Jerry Marcus, and Virgil Partch began as magazine gag cartoonists and moved to syndicated comic strips. Richard Thompson is noteworthy in the area of newspaper cartoon illustration; he illustrated numerous feature articles in \"The Washington Post\" before creating his \"Cul de Sac\" comic strip. The sports section of newspapers usually featured cartoons, sometimes including syndicated features such as Chester \"Chet\" Brown's \"All in Sport\".\n\n\"Editorial cartoons\" are found almost exclusively in news publications and news websites. Although they also employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using irony or satire. The art usually acts as a visual metaphor to illustrate a point of view on current social or political topics. Editorial cartoons often include speech balloons and sometimes use multiple panels. Editorial cartoonists of note include Herblock, David Low, Jeff MacNelly, Mike Peters, and Gerald Scarfe.\n\n\"Comic strips\", also known as \"cartoon strips\" in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence. In the United States, they are not commonly called \"cartoons\" themselves, but rather \"comics\" or \"funnies\". Nonetheless, the creators of comic strips—as well as comic books and graphic novels—are usually referred to as \"cartoonists\". Although humor is the most prevalent subject matter, adventure and drama are also represented in this medium. Some noteworthy cartoonists of humorous comic strips are Scott Adams, Steve Bell, Charles Schulz, E. C. Segar, Mort Walker and Bill Watterson.\n\nPolitical cartoons are like illustrated editorial that serve visual commentaries on political events. They offer subtle criticism which are cleverly quoted with humour and satire to the extent that the criticized does not get embitered.\n\nThe pictorial satire of William Hogarth is regarded as a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th century England. George Townshend produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s. The medium began to develop in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and caricature, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon. By calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account for their behaviour, many of Gillray's satires were directed against George III, depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of revolutionary France and Napoleon. George Cruikshank became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray, from 1815 until the 1840s. His career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications.\n\nBy the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many other countries featured cartoons commenting on the politics of the day. Thomas Nast, in New York City, showed how realistic German drawing techniques could redefine American cartooning. His 160 cartoons relentlessly pursued the criminal characteristic of the Tweed machine in New York City, and helped bring it down. Indeed, Tweed was arrested in Spain when police identified him from Nast's cartoons. Sir John Tenniel was the toast of London.\n\nPolitical cartoons can be humorous or satirical, sometimes with piercing effect. The target of the humor may complain, but they can seldom fight back. Lawsuits have been very rare; the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century in Britain came in 1921, when J. H. Thomas, the leader of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the British Communist Party. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of \"Black Friday\", when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out Miners' Federation. To Thomas, the framing of his image by the far left threatened to grievously degrade his character in the popular imagination. Soviet-inspired communism was a new element in European politics, and cartoonists unrestrained by tradition tested the boundaries of libel law. Thomas won the lawsuit and restored his reputation.\n\nCartoons such as \"xkcd\" have also found their place in the world of science, mathematics, and technology. Cartoons related to chemistry are, for example, the \"Wonderlab\", which looked at daily life in the lab. In the U.S., one well-known cartoonist for these fields is Sidney Harris. Not all, but many of Gary Larson's cartoons have a scientific flavor.\n\nBooks with cartoons are usually magazine-format \"comic books,\" or occasionally reprints of newspaper cartoons.\n\nIn Britain in the 1930s adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by DC Thomson; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines, comic books and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just. D.C. Thomson issued the first \"The Dandy Comic\" in December 1937. It had a revolutionary design that broke away from the usual children's comics that were published broadsheet in size and not very colourful. Thomson capitalized on its success with a similar product \"The Beano\" in 1938.\n\nOn some occasions, new gag cartoons have been created for book publication, as was the case with \"Think Small\", a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by Volkswagen dealers. Bill Hoest and other cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with humorous automotive essays by such humorists as H. Allen Smith, Roger Price and Jean Shepherd. The book's design juxtaposed each cartoon alongside a photograph of the cartoon's creator.\n\nBecause of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, \"cartoon\" came to refer to animation, and the word \"cartoon\" is currently used in reference to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons. While \"animation\" designates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word \"cartoon\" is most often used as a descriptor for television programs and short films aimed at children, possibly featuring anthropomorphized animals, superheroes, the adventures of child protagonists or related themes.\n\nIn the 1980s, \"cartoon\" was shortened to \"toon\", referring to characters in animated productions. This term was popularized in 1988 by the combined live-action/animated film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", followed in 1990 by the animated TV series \"Tiny Toon Adventures\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3169032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3169032", "title": "Cliffjumper", "text": "Cliffjumper\n\nCliffjumper is the name of several fictional robot superhero characters from the Transformers robot superhero franchise. His name is usually associated with an Autobot whose toys are often red repaints of Bumblebee toys.\n\nCliffjumper's bio indicates that he compensates for his small size by being the first to rush into any dangerous situation, desiring only to beat up \"Decepti-creeps.\" Although this trait has his fellow Autobots' respect, occasionally it ensnares him into situations he cannot handle. His motto is \"Let me at 'em!\" \n\nCliffjumper's weapon is his glass gas gun, which fires a gas that turns metal as brittle as glass for a short time. In the episode \"Fire In the Sky,\" he mentions his gun has a \"defrost cycle\" to melt ice.\n\nAccording to original tech spec notes written by Bob Budiansky found at Iacon One in 2006 the original name for Cliffjumper was Blow-Out, a name later used for a \"Generation 2\" Autobot.\n\nHasbro registered the name Cliffjumper for U.S. Trademark in October 2003.\n\nIn \"The Transformers\" animated series, Cliffjumper was part of the original Autobot crew of the Ark. When the Autobots and Decepticons were reawakened, Cliffjumper was given the alternate mode of an Earth car. He and Hound were sent to scout out the location of the Decepticons. Although ordered not to engage the Decepticons, Cliffjumper took the opportunity to try to shoot Megatron, revealing their existence to the Decepticons. Because of this, Hound was blown off the road by Laserbeak – something that made Cliffjumper regret his impulsiveness. Hound, however, did not blame him, quipping that he was only sorry he missed.\n\nCliffjumper's bravery was often a boon to the Autobots – as well as a problem. In the episode \"Changing Gears\", Cliffjumper's rash actions helped the Autobots get past a Decepticon force field and stop their Solar Needle device from destroying the sun. However, Cliffjumper survived the blast but he ended up having a temporary concussion which he was able to recover quickly.\n\nCliffjumper's most prominent appearance came in the season 2 episode \"Traitor\", where he developed the belief that Mirage had sold them out to the Decepticons after missing a Decepticon power plant while on patrol. Mirage then devised a scheme to prove he was not a traitor, setting the Decepticons and Insecticons, who were in a feud, against each other. However, Cliffjumper had followed him, and misinterpreted his actions. Reporting back to base, Cliffjumper told Optimus Prime what he saw and then believed he must be stopped. But Prime decided to go back to the power plant to stop the Decepticons and then find Mirage so they can hear his side of the story with Ratchet accompanying them. Once they got to the power plant they saw no one there until Mirage shows up, who led them into an ambush by the Decepticons and Insecticons. The reason for the setup soon became apparent, as Mirage had been implanted by one of Bombshell's cerebro shells which Ratchet removed, after Cliffjumper knocked him out. Cliffjumper did realize that Mirage didn't betray the Autobots, along with realizing that Mirage was telling him the truth of not seeing them while he was on patrol, when he heard both Prime and Ratchet sum up as to why Mirage set them up. After the Decepticon plant's destruction, Cliffjumper apologized to Mirage for not believing him.\n\nIn \"Starscream's Brigade\", Cliffjumper and Jazz were invited as guest of honor for an unveiling of a statue for their leader Prime but were under attack when Starscream showed up, after he broke off from Megatron, along with his newly created Combaticons. During the scuffle Cliffjumper suggested to Jazz into calling headquarters for help but were captured before they can make the call, as Starscream wanted their Energy absorber for the Combaticons. Cliffjumper with Jazz were chained up at a water and power plant but they did get rescued by the other Autobots when they found their location.\n\nDuring \"\", Cliffjumper, with Jazz again is stationed on Moonbase 1, from which try unsuccessfully to escape when attacked by Unicron. After their apparent consumption by the planet-eater, they are ultimately saved by Daniel Witwicky.\n\nBy season 3, Cliffjumper was reduced to a background character, a result of voice actor Casey Kasem's objection to the portrayal of Arab characters as stereotypical villains and eventual departure from the show.\n\nHis last appearance in the original U.S. cartoon was in \"Five Faces of Darkness, Part 1\", the first episode of the third season.\n\nCliffjumper appeared in the following books:\n\nCliffjumper reappeared in the third G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers crossover series from Devil's Due Publishing as part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe force trying to rescue Optimus Prime.\n\nWhen civil war broke out on the planet Cybertron between the Autobots and Decepticons, Cliffjumper joined the Autobot cause.\nWhen Decepticon Military Operations Commander Shockwave led a force of Decepticons against the Autobot capitol of Iacon, Cliffjumper was among the Autobots who defended the capitol (Transformers: War Within #3).\n\nWhen Decepticon leader Megatron and Autobot leader Optimus Prime disappeared in an accident with a space bridge, the Autobot and Decepticon forces splintered into smaller factions. Cliffjumper stayed with the Autobots under the leadership of Prowl. Learning that the Decepticons were testing a new mobile command base at the Praetorus Wharf, Prowl led Cliffjumper, Gears, Jazz, Skids and Sideswipe to investigate. What they discovered was Trypticon. The giant Decepticon easily routed them, and Prowl's team were only saved by Shockwave's calling him away to battle against the Fallen and Chaos Trinity. (Transformers: The War Within - The Dark Ages #3).\n\nSix million years ago, Ultra Magnus united the Autobot factions and lead them to victory over Decepticons and Ultracons. Megatron returned to Cybertron in command of the clone forces of the Aerospace Extermination Squadron and took over Cybertron. Cliffjumper was among the Autobots enslaved and forced to labor tunneling into Cybertron's core (Transformers: War Within - The Age of Wrath #2). Eventually Optimus Prime returned to Cybertron and helped free the enslaved Autobots.\n\nCliffjumper was among the Autobots who followed Optimus Prime on his mission on board the Ark and crash landed on Earth.\nIn 1984, when the Ark's computer re-activated, it reformatted Cliffjumper as in the form of an Earth car. Eventually the combined forces of the Autobots on Earth, and their human allies were able to capture the Decepticons. A ship called the Ark II was built to take the Cybertronians back to Cybertron, along with some human companions, but the ship exploded shortly after takeoff. The human allies were killed, but the Cybertronians were lost in the ocean, again in stasis lock.\n\nCliffjumper traveled to Cybertron along with Optimus Prime and a number of Autobots when arrested by Ultra Magnus.\n\nBumblebee was placed in command of the Autobot supply shuttle Orion, with Powerglide, Warpath, Seaspray, Cosmos, Cliffjumper, Bumper and the Powerdashers assigned to him. Their mission was to aid the Autobots on Earth. Upon arriving in the Earth system from transwarp space, they witnessed the arrival of Sunstorm (Transformers: Generation One III #1). After Omega Supreme was damaged in the fight with Sunstorm, Cliffjumper was reluctantly assigned the duty of protecting him until he recovered. Dreamwave would go out of business at this point, preventing any further tales of Cliffjumper from being told.\n\nThe \"Classics\" storyline by Fun Publications is set in a sequel to the Marvel Comics story, ignoring the events of the U.K. and \"Generation 2\" comics. It is revealed that Cliffjumper had been in stasis since the attack by the Underbase powered Starscream in the Marvel Comics story, and was only recently revitalized on Cybertron. Optimus Prime then returns to Earth commanding a small groups of Autobots including Cliffjumper when they learn Megatron has returned.\n\nIn \"Crossing Over\" the mysterious Skyfall allies himself with the Autobots as they investigate a strange energy reading in South America. Cliffjumper is assigned to watch over Skyfall by Optimus Prime. Skyfall, Cliffjumper and the Decepticon Landquake arrive in an underground energon pool together and meet the Autobot Breakaway, who is guarding the pool, but has little memory of why. Together Breakaway, Landquake and Skyfall feel they are somehow connected. Cliffjumper refuses to leave Skyfall as they are sent through a dimensional portal by Breakaway's Caretaker computer to find their \"fourth\".\n\nIn the \"Transformers: Timelines\" story \"Shattered Glass\" Cliffjumper is separated in dimensional transit and ends up by himself on a mirror universe Cybertron where the tyrant Optimus Prime and his evil Autobots are opposed by Megatron and the heroic Decepticons. After being shot by Optimus Prime for being a traitor, he is recovered by the Decepticons and joins their cause. He and his glass gas is key to the destruction of the launch pad to the Ark - a space ship the Autobots plan to use to conquer Earth.\n\nCliffjumper appears in the fiction \"Dungeons & Dinobots\", a text based story. He defends the Arch-Ayr fuel dump with the Decepticons from an Autobot attack. He later captures the Dinobots Slugfest and Goryu for the Decepticons to reprogram as Dinocons. Cliffjumper, Sideswipe, Blurr and Rodimus then track Grimlock through a maze of traps and discover the Omega Terminus. A trap separates him with Sideswipe, leaving him to survive with Rodimus. Cliffjumper refuses to be part of Rodimus' plan to use the Terminus to create an army to take over Cybertron. After a run-in with Grimlock and zombified versions of Cliffjumper's evil counterpart and Sideswipe's old commander Drench, they escape the maze.\n\nCliffjumper appears in the story \"Do Over\". When Megatron is captured by the Autobot Targetmasters led by Ricochet, it is Cliffjumper who warns Starscream not to send a large force to rescue him, but instead send a small group of Micromasters. He is among the crew of the Nemesis, which follows the Autobot's Ark to Earth before being shot down by human defenses.\n\nCliffjumper appears in \"Eye in the Sky\". After meeting the Decepticons new human allies Cliffjumper warns that the Autobots probably survived the crash to Earth. He helps recover the stasis pod of Crasher and gets her back online. Cliffjumper, Crasher, Frenzy, Heatwave, Ravage and Soundwave are sent on a mission to Burpleson Air Force Base to stop the Autobots from controlling the Global Orbital Defense System. Heatwave uses his powers to convince the GODS transmitter to fire the weapon on itself and stop the Autobots from taking control.\n\nCliffjumper appears in \"Reunification\" having returned to Cybertron where he was reunited with Landquake, Skyfall and Breakaway just before Cyclonus attempts to kill Megatron at the command of Alpha Trion.\n\nCliffjumper made his first IDW Publishing appearance in issue #3 of \"\", mourning Bumper alongside Bumblebee and Hubcap.\n\nWhen he next appears in Spotlight: Cliffjumper, he successfully engages an entire platoon of Decepticons single handed.\n\nEvents specific to the Marvel U.K. Transformers comics are in \"italics\".\n\nCliffjumper appears in the Marvel Comics \"Transformers\" comic, where his role is much the same as in the animated series. The earlier comic stories feature Cliffjumper prominently, deploying his 'glass gas' gun against unfortunate Decepticons.\n\n\"Cliffjumper works with Windcharger and Gears on the \"Dinobot Hunt\", charged with bringing in the mentally incapacitated Dinobot Sludge. Unfortunately the party were victims of an ambush set up by Soundwave.\"\n\nCliffjumper returns in \"Totaled!\" to fight alongside hundreds of Autobots and Decepticons against the Underbase-empowered Starscream, and was one of the many casualties of his rampage.\n\nCliffjumper is one of eight playable characters in the 1986 Commodore 64 video game \"\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name Cliffjumper was given to a female Mini-Con in \"\". She does not appear in any cartoon or comic-book series, although she did receive a biography in the Dreamwave \"More Than Meets The Eye\" comics.\n\nCliffjumper's bio described her as almost the polar opposite of the Generation 1 Cliffjumper - where he was brash and always ready to fight, she is quiet and reserved, seeking an end to the war so she can return to her scientific career. Sadly for her, she was stuck with , her polar opposite, as a partner. A cocky type always seeking adventure, he often teased her about her name, unaware of the damage it did to her self-esteem. After he was taken as one of Unicron's four horsemen, she felt slightly relieved - almost immediately feeling guilty at the mere thought of it.\n\nThe name Cliffjumper (Overdrive in Japan) was used again in the \"\" line.\n\nIn the \"Transformers: Energon\" animated series, Cliffjumper's name was frequently swapped with fellow Autobot Downshift, as they were originally mistaken for one another when they first appeared. His vehicle mode was a dune racer.\n\nThis Cliffjumper is more reminiscent of the original, as he is described as loving high-risk situations, although not the battle fervour of the original. Cliffjumper loves stunt driving, with the more risk and speed involved the better. While he is a skilled warrior, his unnecessary risk-taking has earned him more than one reprimand from Optimus Prime.\n\nCliffjumper appeared in the \"Transformers: Energon\" series as one of the inexperienced soldiers under the command of sent into the rift caused by the collision of Unicron's head with his body. They eventually succeeded in bringing Optimus Prime's team back to the normal universe. In the final battle, he gave his spark energy to empower Optimus Supreme against the Unicron-possessed Galvatron.\n\nCliffjumper also appeared in the accompanying \"Energon\" comics by Dreamwave Productions. He originally came to Earth to battle the Terrorcons, and became part of the Autobot forces permanently stationed there.\n\nLater, he was knocked out by a surprise attack from Tidal Wave, who further threatened his life to get to do what he wanted.\n\nHe was part of the Autobot forces in Los Angeles, battling against the horde of Insecticon clones - until they were surprisingly bailed out by Megatron. Dreamwave's closure prevented this story from ever being completed.\n\nCliffjumper is the name of a character from the 2007 \"Transformers\" movie .\n\nCliffjumper is impatient and is considered the opposite of the composed Autobot Bumblebee. He'd rather take down a Decepticon by force and then try to get information from their smoldering wreckage than spy on them.\n\nThe Legends 2-pack with Cliffjumper and Recon Barricade says that Cliffjumper and Barricade are old rivals. Cliffjumper often taunts Barricade into making mistakes. Most of the time his taunts lead to victory.\n\nIn \"\" #1 by IDW Publishing, back on ancient Cybertron, Bumblebee and Cliffjumper were tasked to watch over the All Spark at the temple at Simfur. In issue #3, Megatron learns that Optimus Prime has broken into his room so he sends Bumblebee, Camshaft, Cliffjumper, Jazz, Prowl and Smokescreen to arrest Optimus for treason. Optimus demands to speak directly to Megatron, but when the group is traveling to Megatron's location, they are ambushed by Barricade, Brawl, Crankcase, , Starscream, and Thundercracker - who have orders to kill the lot of them. Smokescreen is able to cover Optimus and his group's retreat in the confusion of an explosion. In issue #4 Arcee, Bumbelbee, Cliffjumper, Jazz and Smokescreen ambush Ironhide, who they believed works for Megatron, but Ironhide instead joins Optimus Prime's Autobots.\n\nCliffjumper is among the Autobot forces who witness the launching of the Decepticon ship Nemesis.\n\nIn \"\", the Decepticon Starscream barely makes it to the \"Nemesis\" on Mars before he runs out of power. His return is noted by the Autobot Cosmos, who alerts Arcee, Cliffjumper, Smokescreen, Camshaft and Air Raid. Aided by Thundercracker on the \"Nemesis\", Starscream recovers and sends the information on the Allspark Frenzy had gathered back to Cybertron just as Hardtop spots the Autobots closing on the \"Nemesis\". In issue #3, Cliffjumper is shot in the back by Starscream.\n\nUnlike the other Autobots who were clearly shown to have been killed, Cliffjumper's status was ambiguous in the actual fiction. Chris Mowry says he survived, however. John Barber sneakily alluded to it years later for \"Convergence\".\n\nAll toys of this character are officially licensed from General Motors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of his temper, Cliffjumper has never been much of a spy. Even though he works in Intelligence, he does not interact much with the enemy. Instead, he collects information from field agents and finds the important bits for his superiors. Of course, knowing everything there is to know about the Decepticons makes him a little tense, which is why he's always ready for a fight.\n\nIn the \"Transformers Animated\" episode \"Autoboot Camp\", an Autobot similar in appearance to Bumblebee, but taller, and with longer horns and a red and gray color scheme, is featured. Although not named, series artist Derrick J. Wyatt confirmed that the character is Cliffjumper.\n\nHe makes a reappearance in the season 3 opener, \"Transwarped\", where he gets to speak. He speaks when telling Longarm Prime/Shockwave that, per Ultra Magnus's orders, the Space Bridge Nexus is to be shut down due to the Decepticons trying to transwarp to Cybertron. He then appears outside Longarm/Shockwave's office, told by Longarm to dispose of a cube that was once Blurr, being told it was \"sensitive materials.\"\n\nCliffjumper appeared again in \"Five Servos of Doom\" where he is contacted by Optimus Prime, Sentinel Prime, , and Jetstorm. He told the Earth bound Autobots that about \"50 megacycles ago, Ultra Magnus was attacked by the Decepticon traitor Shockwave.\" He then goes on to say that Ultra Magnus is \"... in recovery, but Shockwave got away with his Magnus hammer and did a number on the communications systems.\" He then gets told that Prowl has captured many of Megatron's top soldiers. He later appears alongside Alpha Trion and Preceptor in a transmission to Sentinel Prime concerning the laters return to Cybertron. Cliffjumper taunts Sentinel by saying that \"he thought it was Prowl\" when Sentinel attempts to take credit for capturing Megatron's soldiers. He was also seen in \"Endgame Part 2\" when Optimus Prime and his team captured Megatron, Shockwave, and Lugnut.\n\nCliffjumper appears among the characters in \"Re-Unification\", the 2010 TFCon voice actor play prelude comic.\n\n\nThis Cliffjumper is the counterpart of \"Generation 1\" Cliffjumper in the \"Shattered Glass\" mirror-universe storyline. He is blue instead of red, and well as being evil like the Autobots in this timeline. His friends described him as being overly trusting. He died before the \"Generation 1\" Cliffjumper arrived on his world, and G1 Cliffjumper was mistaken for his counterpart until the truth became known.\n\nIn \"Dungeons & Dinobots\", the Omega Terminus reanimates the dead body of Cliffjumper and uses it as a weapon against the other Cliffjumper and his Decepticon companions. The undead Cliffjumper is destroyed by Scraplets, who devour dead metal.\n\nCliffjumper appeared in the 2010 computer animated series \"\". His Earth form is a red second-generation Dodge Challenger decorated with bull horns on the hood. Unlike the previous versions of Cliffjumper he is not a recolor of Bumblebee, however he was in the \"War for/Fall of Cybertron\" video games, however in the animated series when the Autobots change into Earth-based vehicles their appearance changes completely except for Cliffjumper, whose Cybertronian robot mode remained when he was a Dodge Challenger for unknown reasons.\n\nCliffjumper first appears in the first two episodes of the \"Transformers: Prime\" 5-part mini-series \"Darkness Rising.\" Outside of Jasper, Nevada, Cliffjumper tells how he got a boot from human police officers for being parked illegally, and scared the officers by kicking it off and driving by. He soon discovers a deposit of Energon and is attacked by Vehicons, destroying the Energon during the one-sided fight before being captured. He is taken before , who fatally stabs the Autobot in the chest when Cliffjumper asks where Starscream's master is. Cliffjumper's lifeless body is later used by to test the Dark Energon he obtained, reanimating the Autobot into a mindless beast before being sliced in half and later falling to his death.\n\nIn \"Predatory\", Airachnid mentioned to Arcee the deaths of Cliffjumper and Tailgate, whom were both her partners and suggested Arcee was the reason they died. Also Cliffjumper is seen in one of the flashback's rescuing Arcee with Bumblebee as they saved her from Airachnid on Cybertron. In \"Partners\", Arcee discovers that it was Starscream who killed Cliffjumper, and attempts to take revenge by forcing Starscream into a fight despite his surrender. In \"Stronger, Faster\", Cliffjumper was mentioned by Ratchet, as he blamed Optimus's beliefs in protecting humanity for causing Cliffjumper's demise, infuriating Arcee.\n\nIn \"Out of the Past,\" a flashback showed that Cliffjumper and Arcee had been captured by Starscream in his plot to force them into decoding a cryptic Autobot message at the time when Arcee didn't know Cliffjumper. Upon being imprisoned, Cliffjumper is asked by Arcee about how he got captured. Cliffjumper states that he intercepted some Decepticon message where Starscream was delivering Energon to Shockwave. In order to get the encryption from Arcee and Cliffjumper, Starscream brings them to Kaon to let Shockwave extract it from them. When Shockwave plans to dispose of Cliffjumper, Starscream tells Shockwave the Cliffjumper is his. Shockwave acknowledges Starscream's orders and leaves. Before Starscream can finish off Cliffjumper, Arcee breaks free and frees Cliffjumper while trapping Starscream. Arcee and Cliffjumper learn from Starscream that Shockwave is using the Energon to build a Space Bridge. While heading towards Shockwave, Cliffjumper tells Arcee that he knows what Airachnid did to Tailgate. Arcee and Cliffjumper take out two Vehicon guards at the Space Bridge where the Decepticons can use the Space Bridge to get to Earth before Autobot reinforcements can arrive. Cliffjumper distracts two more Vehicons while Arcee sabotages the Space Bridge. After knocking out Shockwave, Arcee and Cliffjumper are attacked. Arcee and Cliffjumper escape into the Space Bridge before it explodes. When Shockwave tries to follow them, Arcee manages to shoot Shockwave in the head as Arcee and Cliffjumper successfully arrive on Earth. Before leaving to find Optimus Prime, Arcee and Cliffjumper are left wondering if Shockwave survived the Space Bridge's explosion.\n\nCliffjumper appears in the short story \"Bumblebee at Tyger Pax\" By Alex Irvine.\n\nCliffjumper appears in the novel \"Transformers: Exodus\".\n\nCliffjumper is one of the Autobots featured in the \"Transformers: Prime\" trade paperback by IDW Publishing, which leads into the animated series.\n\nCliffjumper appears in the 2010 video game \"\". He is a red redeco of Bumblebee and unique to the Nintendo DS version of the game.\n\nCliffjumper appears again in \"\". He is playable in Chapter 4 of the game. In this chapter Cliffjumper and Jazz explore the Sea of Rust looking for Grimlock. He has the special ability to turn invisible. This level is also the first time he fights elite guards.\n\nHe appears in \"\" in the Cybertron levels. He is a playable character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "73192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73192", "title": "Codex Seraphinianus", "text": "Codex Seraphinianus\n\nCodex Seraphinianus, originally published in 1981, is an illustrated encyclopedia of an imaginary world, created by Italian artist, architect and industrial designer Luigi Serafini during 30 months from 1976 to 1978. It is approximately 360 pages (depending on edition) and written in a cipher alphabet in a constructed language.\n\nOriginally published in Italy, it has been released in several countries.\n\nThe Codex is an encyclopedia in manuscript with copious hand-drawn, colored-pencil illustrations of bizarre and fantastical flora, fauna, anatomies, fashions, and foods. It has been compared to the still undeciphered Voynich manuscript, the story \"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\" by Jorge Luis Borges, and the artwork of M. C. Escher and Hieronymus Bosch.\n\nThe illustrations are often surreal parodies of things in the real world, such as a bleeding fruit, a plant that grows into roughly the shape of a chair and is subsequently made into one, a copulating couple that metamorphoses into an alligator. Others depict odd, apparently senseless machines, often with delicate appearances and bound by tiny filaments. Some illustrations are recognizable as maps or human faces; while others (especially in the \"physics\" chapter) are mostly or totally abstract. Nearly all of the illustrations are brightly coloured and highly detailed.\n\nThe writing system (possibly a false one) appears modeled on Western writing systems, with left-to-right writing in rows and an alphabet with uppercase and lowercase letters, some of which double as numerals. Some letters appear only at the beginning or end of words, similarly to Semitic writing systems. The curvilinear letters are rope- or thread-like, with loops and even knots, and are somewhat reminiscent of Sinhalese script.\n\nThe book's \"language\" has defied analysis for decades. The page-numbering system, however, has been cracked (apparently independently) by Allan C. Wechsler and Bulgarian linguist Ivan Derzhanski, among others, and is a variation of base 21.\n\nIn a talk at the Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles on 11 May 2009, Serafini stated that there is no meaning behind the \"Codex\"'s script, which is asemic; that his experience in writing it was similar to automatic writing; and that what he wanted his alphabet to convey was the sensation children feel with books they cannot yet understand, although they see that the writing makes sense for adults.\n\nThe book is in eleven chapters, in two sections. The first section appears to describe the natural world of flora, fauna and physics. The second deals with various aspects of human life, including garments, history, cuisine and architecture. Each chapter seems to address a general encyclopedic topic, as follows:\n\n\nAfter the last chapter is a table of contents or index, followed by an apparent afterword whose writing is more casually rendered.\n\nTwo plates in the sixth chapter contain lines of French text, a quote from Marcel Proust's \"A la recherche du temps perdu: Albertine disparue\" (\"In Search of Lost Time: Albertine Gone\"). The words scattered on the floor of the illustration are from the same book.\n\nThe original edition was issued in two volumes:\n\nTwo years later, a single-volume edition was issued in the United States, in Germany and in the Netherlands:\n\nThe 1980s editions were out of print for several years before Franco Maria Ricci published an augmented, single-volume edition in 1993:\n\n\nIn 2006, Rizzoli published an expanded, but less expensive, edition in Italy. It features additional illustrations and a preface by the author:\n\n\nIn 2013, Rizzoli published a second revised edition, as well as limited, signed, and numbered \"deluxe\" edition. They printed 300 copies in Italian and 300 in English:\n\n\nIn 2016, a 2017 \"Codex Seraphinianus\" wall calendar was published by Universe Publishing.\n\n\nBaird Searles, in \"Asimov's Science Fiction\" (April 1984), says \"the book lies in the uneasy boundary between surrealism and fantasy, given an odd literary status by its masquerade as a book of fact\".\n\nDouglas R. Hofstadter, in \"\", finds many of the illustrations \"grotesque and disturbing\" and others \"extremely beautiful and visionary\". He says the book \"seems to [some people] to glorify entropy, chaos, and incomprehensibility\".\n\nAmerican journalist Jim Dwyer finds that the work is an early critique of the Information Age.\n\nIf the encyclopedia tends to fix the knowledge of a certain era, in Serafini's \"fantaencyclopedia\" there is nothing solid. According to Italo Calvino, the skeleton is \"the only nucleus of reality which endures in the same way in this world full of interchangeable shapes\". For this ironic and involving variability, the Codex Seraphinianus keeps in touch with the psychic area and establish an attempt of \"contradictory world's cataloguing of halfway shapes\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "170362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170362", "title": "Cold reading", "text": "Cold reading\n\nCold reading is a set of techniques used by mentalists, psychics, fortune-tellers, mediums, illusionists (readers), and scam artists to imply that the reader knows much more about the person than the reader actually does. Without prior knowledge, a practiced cold-reader can quickly obtain a great deal of information by analyzing the person's body language, age, clothing or fashion, hairstyle, gender, sexual orientation, religion, race or ethnicity, level of education, manner of speech, place of origin, etc. Cold readings commonly employ high-probability guesses, quickly picking up on signals as to whether their guesses are in the right direction or not, then emphasizing and reinforcing chance connections and quickly moving on from missed guesses. Psychologists believe that this appears to work because of the Forer effect and due to confirmation biases within people.\n\nBefore starting the actual reading, the reader will typically try to elicit cooperation from the subject, saying something such as, \"I often see images that are a bit unclear and which may sometimes mean more to you than to me; if you help, we can together uncover new things about you.\" One of the most crucial elements of a convincing cold reading is a subject eager to make connections or reinterpret vague statements in any way that will help the reader appear to make specific predictions or intuitions. While the reader will do most of the talking, it is the subject who provides the meaning.\n\nAfter determining that the subject is cooperative, the reader will make a number of probing statements or questions, typically using variations of the methods noted below. The subject will then reveal further information with their replies (whether verbal or non-verbal) and the cold reader can continue from there, pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones. In general, while revelations seem to come from the reader, most of the facts and statements come from the subject, which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader got something correct.\n\nSubtle cues such as changes in facial expression or body language can indicate whether a particular line of questioning is effective or not. Combining the techniques of cold reading with information obtained covertly (also called \"hot reading\") can leave a strong impression that the reader knows or has access to a great deal of information about the subject. Because the majority of time during a reading is spent dwelling on the \"hits\" the reader obtains, while the time spent recognizing \"misses\" is minimized, the effect gives an impression that the cold reader knows far more about the subject than an ordinary stranger could.\n\nJames Underdown from Center for Inquiry and Independent Investigations Group said, \"In the context of a studio audience full of people, cold reading is not very impressive.\" Underdown explains cold-reading from a mathematical viewpoint. A typical studio audience consists of approximately 200 people, divided up into three sections. A conservative estimate assumes each person knows 150 people. Underdown says:\n\nMentalist Mark Edward relates from personal experience as a \"psychic performer\" how powerful a hit can be when someone in a large audience \"claims\" a phrase such as a \"clown in a graveyard\" statement. Edward describes a mental image of a clown placing flowers on graves and adds, \"Does that mean anything to someone?\" whereupon a woman stands up and claims that he is speaking directly to her. She remembers it as Edward specifically stating that \"she\" knew a man who dressed as a clown and placed flowers on graves in her hometown. Edward reports that it took some convincing to get her to understand that he was \"not\" directly talking to her, but had thrown the statement out to the entire audience of 300 people. She made the connection, and because it seemed so personal and the situation so odd she felt that he was talking to her directly.\n\n\"Shotgunning\" is a commonly used cold reading technique. This technique is named after the manner in which a shotgun fires a cluster of small projectiles in the hope that one or more of them will strike the target.\n\nThe cold reader slowly offers a huge quantity of very general information, often to an entire audience (some of which is very likely to be correct, near correct or at the very least, provocative or evocative to someone present), observes their subjects' reactions (especially their body language), and then narrows the scope, acknowledging particular people or concepts and refining the original statements according to those reactions to promote an emotional response. A majority of people in a room will, at some point for example, have lost an older relative or known at least one person with a common name like \"Mike\" or \"John\".\n\nShotgunning might include a series of vague statements such as:\n\nThe Forer effect relies in part on the eagerness of people to fill in details and make connections between what is said and some aspect of their own lives, often searching their entire life's history to find some connection, or reinterpreting statements in a number of different possible ways so as to make it apply to themselves.\n\n\"Barnum statements\", named after P. T. Barnum, the American showman, are statements that seem personal, yet apply to many people. And while seemingly specific, such statements are often open-ended or give the reader the maximum amount of \"wiggle room\" in a reading. They are designed to elicit identifying responses from people. The statements can then be developed into longer and more sophisticated paragraphs and seem to reveal great amounts of detail about a person. A talented and charismatic reader can sometimes even bully a subject into admitting a connection, demanding over and over that they acknowledge a particular statement as having some relevance and maintaining that they are just not thinking hard enough, or are repressing some important memory.\n\nStatements of this type might include:\n\nRegarding the last statement, if the subject is old enough, his or her father is quite likely to have died, and this statement would easily apply to a large number of medical conditions. The list includes: heart disease, pneumonia, diabetes, emphysema, cirrhosis of the liver, renal failure, most types of cancer, and, for that matter, to any cause of death in which cardiac arrest precedes death, or damage to the brainstem responsible for cardiopulmonary function.\n\nWarm reading is a performance tool used by professional mentalists and psychic scam artists. While hot reading is the use of foreknowledge and cold reading works on reacting to the subject's responses, warm reading refers to the judicious use of Barnum effect statements.\n\nWhen these psychological tricks are used properly, the statements give the impression that the mentalist, or psychic scam artist, is intuitively perceptive and psychically gifted. In reality, the statements fit nearly all of humanity, regardless of gender, personal opinions, age, epoch, culture or nationality.\n\nMichael Shermer gives the example of jewelry worn by those in mourning. Most people in this situation will be wearing or carrying an item of jewelry with some connection to the person they have lost, but if asked directly in the context of a psychic reading whether they have such an item, the client may be shocked and assume that the reader learned the information directly from the deceased loved one. Robert Todd Carroll notes in \"The Skeptic's Dictionary\" that some would consider this to be cold reading.\n\nThe rainbow ruse is a crafted statement which simultaneously awards the subject a specific personality trait, as well as the opposite of that trait. With such a phrase, a cold reader can \"cover all possibilities\" and appear to have made an accurate deduction in the mind of the subject, despite the fact that a rainbow ruse statement is vague and contradictory. This technique is used since personality traits are not quantifiable, and also because nearly everybody has experienced both sides of a particular emotion at some time in their lives.\n\nStatements of this type include:\n\nA cold reader can choose from a variety of personality traits, think of its opposite, and then bind the two together in a phrase, vaguely linked by factors such as mood, time, or potential.\n\nThe mentalist branch of the stage-magician community approves of \"reading\" as long as it is presented strictly as an artistic entertainment and one is not pretending to be psychic.\n\nSome performers who use cold reading are honest about their use of the technique. Lynne Kelly, Kari Coleman, Ian Rowland, and Derren Brown have used these techniques at either private fortune-telling sessions or open forum \"talking with the dead\" sessions in the manner of those who claim to be genuine mediums. Only after receiving acclaim and applause from their audience do they reveal that they needed no psychic power for the performance, only a sound knowledge of psychology and cold reading.\n\nIn an episode of his \"Trick of the Mind\" series broadcast in March 2006, Derren Brown showed how easily people can be influenced through cold reading techniques by repeating Bertram Forer's famous demonstration of the \"personal validation fallacy\", or \"Forer effect\".\nIn a detailed review of four sittings done by medium Tyler Henry, Edward and Susan Gerbic reviewed all statements made by him on the TV show \"Hollywood Medium\". In their opinion not one statement made by Henry was accurate, yet each sitter felt that their reading was highly successful. In interviews done with each sitter afterward, all four claimed specific statements made by Henry but after reviewing the show it was shown that he had not. Each sitter had misremembered the precise statement. One of many examples of this was when Henry, during a session with celebrity Ross Matthews, stated \"Bambi, why am I connecting to Bambi\"? Matthews stated that his father who was a hunter would not shoot deer because of the movie \"Bambi\". In the post interview, Matthews stated that \"it was weird that Henry knew that my father would not shoot deer because of Bambi\", demonstrating that Matthews had misremembered what Henry had said.\n\nGerbic has pointed out the broader issue of the human brain attempting to make connections that then make it appear that the psychic was correct. She lists this among a number of techniques or situations that psychics take advantage of.\n\nFormer New Age practitioner Karla McLaren has spoken about developing a system of cold reading without realising, saying in a 2004 interview that \"I didn't understand that I had long used a form of cold reading in my own work! I was never taught cold reading and I never intended to defraud anyone; I simply picked up the technique through cultural osmosis.\" McLaren has said that since she was always very perceptive, she could easily figure out many of the issues that people brought into sessions with them. In order to reduce the appearance of unusual expertise that might have created a power differential, she posed her observations as questions rather than facts. This attempt to be polite, she realized, actually invited the other person, as McLaren has said, to \"lean into the reading\" and give her more pertinent information.\n\nAfter some people have performed hundreds of readings, their skills may improve to the point where they may start believing they can read minds. They may ask themselves if their success is because of psychology, intuition or a psychic ability. This point of thought is known by some skeptics of the paranormal as the \"transcendental temptation\". Magic historian and occult investigator Milbourne Christopher has warned that the transcendental choice may lead one unknowingly into a belief in the occult and a deterioration of reason.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51528233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51528233", "title": "Connectivity (media)", "text": "Connectivity (media)\n\nConnectivity refers broadly to social connections forged through mediated communications systems. That is, 'since the arrival of the World Wide Web and the spread of mobile communications, mediated connectivity has been quietly normalized as central to a consolidating ‘global imaginary’ One aspect of this is the ability of the social media to accumulate economic capital from the users' connections and activities on social media platforms by using certain mechanisms in their architecture. According to several scholars (van Dijck and Poell) \"it is a key element of social media logic, having a material and metaphorical importance in social media culture\". This concept originates from the technological term of \"connectivity\" but its application to the media field has acquired additional social and cultural implications. The increasing role of social media in everyday life serves as the basis of such connectivity in the 21st century. It shows the interrelations between the users activities on social media and at the same time the empowerment of the social media platforms with the data that was produced by the users and given to those services for granted.\n\nConnectivity developed with the rise of the Internet, first with the introduction Web 1.0 and later Web 2.0. New improvements in equipment, software, the advancement of speed and access have increased the level and quality of connectivity. Along with these improvements, new media such as social networking systems (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google+), websites that provide access to user-generated content (e.g. Youtube, Myspace, Flickr), trading and marketing sites (e.g. Amazon, eBay, Groupon) and also game sites (e.g. FarmVille, The Sims Social) have become an essential part of everyday life of an average user: \"Just as electricity in the 19th and 20th centuries transformed societies by penetrating every fibre of people’s personal and professional lives, network connectivity is probably the most powerful transformative force in early 21st-century cultures\". This made a shift in the understanding of the nature of connectivity and moved the initial focus just from a technical side of the notion to its increasingly acquired techno-socio-cultural character. \n\nAs mentioned before, connectivity is built on the principles of Web 2.0. that promote an openness, create the vision of empowerment of the user in the generation of a new content and coordination of the information flow on the Internet. These mechanisms encourage staying in touch with each other despite distances and share as much data as possible. According to Youngs, the development of the Internet has resulted in the deeper permeation of ICTs into public and private spheres of peoples' life, their relationships and spheres of identity. Hence, connectivity becomes a resource of maintaining these activities. However, van Dijck notices that this connectivity is not just a neutral feature of new media, but is manufactured by the combination of human and technological resources, where the role of technologies is intransparent. Algorithms and protocols that are part of such platforms prompt users activities and online experiences on social media platforms. One of the most prominent activities on social media includes sharing and as Kennedy argues, \"sharing rhetoric draws on a cultural image of connectivity. Social media platforms are not the only actors to use such imagining, mobile-based platforms do the same. Network providers, handset manufacturers, and social media platforms each promote social activities of togetherness enabled by their products which evidences a sustained cultural norm of sharing through teletechnologies for the purpose of affective connectivity\". Therefore, such architecture creates even bigger demand in connectivity that is continuously exploited by the online market. As José van Dijck notices, connectivity quickly assumed the connotation of users accumulating social capital, while in fact this term increasingly referred to owners amassing economic capital. As the result, social media gain political and economic importance having the power at the levels of grassroots activists, governments, and corporations.\n\nFacebook can serve as a good example how connectivity is being produced and exploited by social media. Van Dijck mentions three concepts implemented in the technological side of connectivity which result in the connective structure of the platform and in the creation of its additional social and cultural dimensions. These are platform, protocol and interface. \n\nSeveral scholars (van Dijck, Gillespie) mention in their works the ambiguity of the term \"platform\" that promises to bring openness, access, to be neutral and help people build social connections and participate in online activities, but in fact implies a more complicated structure of the media, most of the time created for the profit purposes and as the enhancement of control under the users. As for the protocols and interfaces, the algorithms behind the platform are intransparent and presented to the user as intermediaries for 'staying in touch', being connected, encouraging to make those connections, but at the same time the platform itself \"facilitates the cultivation of 'weak ties' as well as the fabrication of 'strong ties'\". Therefore, connectivity becomes a new type of social capital gained from the platform's working principles.\n\n\"Culture of connectivity\" is the term suggested by the Dutch scholar José van Dijck for defining the contemporary interweaving of the online and offline practices and the omnipresence of social media in modern life. The researcher explained the emergence of this culture as the process that evolved in a rather short period of time and indicated the shift from \"networked communication to \"performed\" sociality, from a participatory culture to culture to connectivity\". Moreover, the evolution of this culture was one of the parts of the changing processes that took place in private, corporate and public domains.\n\n"}

Players are given a scenario and have to break out of a locked room within 45 minutes, and each player can only enter each themed room once.\n\nFounded in 2012, Freeing HK is the city’s first room escape game. It was set up by a group of four friends, including a business student from HKUST called Raymond Sze Wai-hang and a business man called Instant Wan Sze-tang. Freeing HK aims at providing “an alternative to the usual entertainments such as shopping, karaoke or watching movies, which Hong Kong people are so tired of”. It also symbolizes escaping from boring Hong Kong.\n\nIn these years, the phenomenon “Hong Kong Kid” frequently hits the headlines stating that Hong Kong youngsters have low emotional intelligence and are vulnerable to adversity. “The game can help participants enhance their problem-solving skills and learn to stand still when facing challenges”, said one of the founders, Raymond Sze Wai-hang. Amid the game, participants are locked up in a room and there is only one way to escape which is to figure out the correlation between clues and solve all the questions by themselves. Skills like the way to fire up imagination, solve problems and communicate with teammates thus can be learnt throughout the activity.\n\nFreeing HK is a local real-life game established by four young people. By the time they wanted to actualize their ideas, negative opinions and discouragement were from all around. Spending a half year on marketing, they finally started the business and had over 80,000 customers within a year. This case has aroused the public attention and has emboldened youngsters to be brave to set up a business. Recently, the team has adopted the new technology introduced by ALiVE, a laboratory of School of Creative Media of City University of Hong Kong. For a long time, Hong Kong has been criticized for overlooking the importance of creativity. Regarding this, Freeing HK is considered as an encouragement to the public in achieving their dreams.\n\nFreeing HK has received a wide coverage from mass media since it has launched in 2012. They have been invited by national and international media for Interviews and news reports. National media included BBC News （UK）, TVB (Hong Kong), Now TV (Hong Kong) and Dragon TV (Shanghai) while International media included AFP (France), CBC (Canada) and CNN (US).\n\nOver 100,000 people have experienced this real-life escape game so far. 80 percent of the customers aged from 15 to 25. Freeing HK was at first targeting mainly youngsters in Hong Kong. Gaining popularity among Hong Kong society, there is a growing trend in customers from office workers as well.\n\nBeside typical walk-ins, collaboration with other companies and corporate training are within Freeing HK's services. It has so far organized corporate team building events for a wide range of companies, such as P&G and Cathay Pacific, with debriefing sections provided as well. Meanwhile, Freeing HK have also involved in several charity events with local organizations, such as Evangelical Lutheran Church Social Service (Hong Kong) and Orbis. Freeing HK also has frequent commercial collaboration with other companies, such as LG and Acuvue.\n\nThe game had had 5,000 people visiting in the first three months after it launched. Initially, Freeing HK had only one outlet located in Sai Yeung Choi Street South, Mong Kok. In 2013, outlets in Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui were opened respectively in April and May. In September 2013, the 4th outlet was based in Kwun Tong, which is the first outlet that adopts 3-D technology. Later, the Yuen Long and Tsuen Wan outlets and the first overseas outlets in Macau were launched. Freeing HK is now planning to extend their business to Guangzhou.\n\nIn 2013, HK escape, another real-life room escape in Hong Kong was accused by Freeing HK of infringement of copyrights. Freeing HK demanded compensation and immediate injunction to stop HK escape's business.\n\nIn 2013, the Freeing SG was set up in Singapore, being the largest \"Freeing\" flagship globally.\n\nFreeing HK has 7 branches, 6 of them located in Hong Kong and 1 in Macau. All branches have different themes including adventure, technology, Hong Kong style, fantasy, riddle, dream and Macau style. These themed rooms are located in Causeway Bay, Kwun Tong, Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui, Tsuen Wan, Yuen Long and Macau respectively.\nIn order to make the game as a tailor-made experience for Hongkongers, riddles are based on knowledge of Hong Kong or stories, movies and places that local people are familiar with. The outlet in Mong Kok themed Hong Kong were built based on Hong Kong featured stories, sites, tools such as traditional toys and other collective memories in the city. For example, one of the themed rooms is called Stalker’s Treachery, and players have to escape by crawling along the tunnel,like most local Gangster wars do.\n\nTechnologies such as 3-D animation, laser, projection and interactive inductor are employed to enhance the sense of reality and create tense atmosphere. Besides, Role-playing game (RPG) elements are added into the game. For example, in Kwun Tong branch which uses technology as the theme, players have to use laser to “kill” the monster; while in another themed room, 3 actors who dress like magicians will guide the players through the adventure. Freeing HK makes the real life room escape game into a 21st-century adventure.\n\n\n"}

Series creator Tim Kring returned as executive producer. During the 2015 Super Bowl, NBC aired a 16-second teaser promo for the series.\n\nOn July 9, 2015, a six-chapter web-series titled \"Dark Matters\" was released to introduce the characters and story of \"Heroes Reborn\". On January 13, 2016, it was announced that \"Heroes Reborn\" would not be renewed for a second season.\n\nAccording to the official synopsis, the miniseries will \"reconnect with the basic elements of the show's first season\" in which ordinary people discover that they have special abilities. A six-chapter prequel web-based series titled \"Dark Matters\" was released on July 9, 2015, to introduce the new characters and story lines.\n\nThe series takes place one year after a terrorist attack in Odessa, Texas. The government blames those with extraordinary abilities (\"Evolved humans\", or \"Evos\"), who are forced into hiding when vigilantes systematically hunt and kill them. Two such killers, Luke and Joanne Collins, are seeking revenge for the son they lost at the Odessa bombing.\n\nNoah Bennet is also in hiding, but is found by the conspiracy theorist Quentin Frady, who tries to show him the truth behind the Odessa tragedy. Meanwhile, new characters are discovering their own unique abilities. In Illinois, Tommy tries to live a normal life with his dream girlfriend, Emily, after being forced to move and change his name to hide his powers. In Tokyo, Miko is looking for her missing father, but her quest to find him could prove deadly. A new hero is emerging in Los Angeles through Carlos, a former soldier whose brother (an Evo) tried to protect people with powers. Malina is an innocent teenager who, although inexperienced with her powers, has a great destiny. Meanwhile, in the shadows, Erica Kravid, the head of the highly successful tech conglomerate Renautas, has acquired Primatech with dark goals.\n\nAs the number of Evos grows, some heroes of the past, including Hiro Nakamura, Matt Parkman, Mohinder Suresh, The Haitian René, Angela Petrelli, Micah Sanders, and Molly Walker, cross paths with the new, emerging Evos.

He stated that \"This is not the fifth season, this is actually the 10th season\".\n\n\n\nIn Canada, the series was simulcast with the American broadcast. In Australia, the series began airing on September 30, 2015. The first two episodes that aired in Australia received 444,000 and 372,000 viewers respectively.\nThe series started broadcasting in the UK from February 16, 2016.\n\n\"Heroes Reborn\" received mixed-to-negative reviews from television critics, with a critic score of 53 out of 100 on Metacritic. On Rotten Tomatoes it received a 43% fresh rating, where it was criticized for overuse of special effects and melodrama.\n\nAbout the show's reception, Kring said: \"Well, when you make a show like that, I was adamant about that show being a thirteen-episode event series, and having a closed-ended quality to it. I had always felt that one of the issues with \"Heroes\" was the ongoing nature of it was difficult to sustain, so I really loved the idea that this was a thirteen-episode event series, and when it was over, it was over. I don’t know that the audience ever really understood that that was the initial plan from the very beginning. So I think that it got a little confusing for the audience as to whether it was a reboot of \"Heroes\", or whether it was just an event series. As much as we tried to say it every time in the press, I think that message may not have completely come through, that it was always intended to come to an end. So in terms of how it wrapped up, I feel a little remorse that I think a lot of people didn’t understand that it was supposed to wrap up when it did. We actually really felt very good about what we accomplished with the thirteen episodes.\n\n\"Heroes Reborn - Event Series\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray disc on April 12, 2016 in Region 1 by Universal Studios Home Entertainment.\n\n"}
{"id": "233996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=233996", "title": "Hostel", "text": "Hostel\n\nHostels provide budget, sociable accommodation where guests can rent a bed, usually a bunk bed, in a dormitory and share a bathroom, lounge and sometimes a kitchen. Rooms can be mixed or single-sex, and private rooms may also be available.\n\nHostels are often cheaper for both the operator and occupants; many hostels have long-term residents who they employ as desk agents or housekeeping staff in exchange for experience or discounted accommodation.\n\nIn India, Pakistan and South Africa, \"hostel\" also refers to boarding schools or student dormitories in resident colleges and universities. In other parts of the world, the word hostel mainly refers to properties offering shared accommodation to travellers or backpackers.\n\nIn 1912, in Altena Castle in Germany, Richard Schirrmann created the first permanent \"Jugendherberge\" or \"Youth Hostel.\" These first youth hostels were an exponent of the vision of the German Youth Movement to let poor city youngsters breathe fresh air outdoors. The youths were supposed to manage the hostel themselves as much as possible, doing chores to keep the costs down and build character, and be physically active outdoors. Because of this, many youth hostels closed during the middle part of the day.\n\nThere are several differences between hostels and hotels, including:\n\n\nThere is less privacy in a hostel than in a hotel. Sharing sleeping accommodation in a dormitory is very different from staying in a private room in a hotel or bed and breakfast, and might not be comfortable for those requiring more privacy. Hostels encourage more social interaction between guests due to the shared sleeping areas and communal areas such as lounges, kitchens and internet cafes.\n\nCare should be taken with personal belongings, as guests may share a common living space, so it is advisable to secure guests' belongings. Most hostels offer some sort of system for safely storing valuables, and an increasing number of hostels offer private lockers; there are other things to consider as well when choosing a safe hostel, such as whether they have a guest curfew, uphold fire codes, 24-hour security, and CCTV.\n\nNoise can make sleeping difficult on occasions, whether from snoring, talking, sexual activity, someone either returning late or leaving early, or the proximity of so many people. To mitigate this, some wear earplugs and/or sleeping masks.\n\nIn attempts to attract more visitors, many hostels nowadays provide additional services not previously available, such as airport shuttle transfers, internet cafés, swimming pools and spas, tour booking and carfree hire. Some hostels may include a hot meal in the price.\n\nThe traditional hostel format involved dormitory style accommodation. Some newer hostels also include en-suite accommodation with single, double or quad occupancy rooms, though to be considered a hostel they must also provide dormitory accommodation. In recent years, the numbers of independent and backpackers' hostels have increased greatly to cater for the greater numbers of overland, multi-destination travellers (such as gap-year travellers and rail-trippers).\n\nThe quality of such places has also improved dramatically. While most hostels still insist on a curfew, daytime lockouts, very few require occupants to do chores apart from washing and drying up after food preparation.\n\nRichard Schirrmann's idea of hostels rapidly spread overseas and eventually resulted in Hostelling International, an organisation composed of more than 90 different youth hostel associations representing over 4,500 youth hostels in over 80 countries.\n\nSome HI Youth Hostels cater more to school-aged children (sometimes through school trips) and parents with their children, whereas others are more for travellers intent on learning new cultures. However, while the exploration of different cultures and places is emphasised in many hostels, particularly in cities or popular tourist destinations, there are still many hostels providing accommodation for outdoor pursuits such as hillwalking, climbing and bicycle touring; these are often small friendly hostels retaining much of the original vision and often provide valuable access to more remote regions.\n\nIn the past several years, Hostelling International have increasingly added hotels and package resorts to their networks in addition to hostels.\n\nDespite their name, in most countries membership is not limited to youth.\n\nIndependent hostels are not necessarily affiliated with one of the national bodies of Hostelling International, Youth Hostel Association or any other hostel network. Often, the word \"independent\" is used to refer to non-HI hostels even when the hostels do belong to another hostelling organization such as SIH and Backpackers Canada.\n\nThe term \"youth\" is less often used with these properties. Unlike a hotel chain where everything is standardised, these hostels can be very diverse, typically not requiring a membership card. There are chains of independent hostels throughout the world such as the Jazz Hostels on the East Coast and Banana Bungalow Hostels on the West Coast of the United States, or the Generator Hostels and Equity Point Hostels of Europe, or Zostel of India. Each offers their own niche of services to travellers and backpackers. For example, one independent hostel might feature a lot of in house gatherings, another might feature daily and nightly tours or events in the surrounding city, and another might have a quieter place to relax in serenity, or be located on the beach. This is an independent hostel's personality and travellers will frequent the hostels that offer the personality that they find desirable. There is frequently a distinction being a \"party hostel\" or not.\n\nThe general backpacking community is no longer exclusively typified by student travellers and extreme shoe string budgets. In response to demand, as well as increasing competition between the rapidly growing number of hostels, the overall quality of hostels has improved across the industry. In addition to the increase in quality among all styles of hostel, new styles of hostels have developed that have a focus on a more trendy, design interior. As research shows there is also a growing segment of older remote working travelers preferring hostels or backpacker lodging that offer slightly more upmarket private rooms or generally quieter accommodation such as Blouberg Backpackers in Cape Town. Thus there is a changing trend towards hostels offering this type of service inclusive of en-suite bathrooms and more in some instances along with improved quality of service. Thus the term 'Boutique Hostel' is increasing to attract this sort of guest.\n\nThe phrase \"boutique hostel\" an often-arbitrary marketing term typically used to describe intimate, luxurious or quirky hostel environments. The term has started to lose meaning because the facilities of many \"boutique hostels\" are often no different from hostels that are not referred to with that label. Also, marketers and online booking websites sometimes include boutique hotels in lists of \"boutique hostels,\" further diluting any specific meaning of the phrase.\n\nA related term, \"flashpackers\", often refers to hostels that target themselves as catering to a slightly older, tech-savvy clientele, but in practice, many of the new class of higher-quality hostels across the industry offer these tech-oriented facilities, and even the flashpacker websites that appeared in 2006–08 during the peak of the \"flashpacker\" hype are neglected or offline as of 2012 as the term has rapidly lost popularity.\n\nThough very uncommon, a mobile hostel is a hostel with no fixed location. It can exist in the form of a campsite, a temporary building, bus, van, or a short term agreement in a permanent building. Mobile hostels have sprouted up at large festivals where there exists a shortage of budget accommodation. As with regular hostels, mobile hostels generally provide dormitory accommodation for backpackers or travelers on a shoe string budget. The first ever (and only) commercial example of a mobile hostel is Hostival. It has sprouted up at Oktoberfest, Carnival, San Fermin, Las Fallas and the 2010 World Cup.\n\nThe independent hostel industry is growing rapidly in many cities around the world, such as New York, Rome, Buenos Aires and Miami. This is reflected in the development and expansion of dozens of hostel chains worldwide. The recent eruption in independent hostels has been called \"probably the single biggest news in the world of low-cost travel and very safe\".\n\nThe development of independent backpackers hostels is a strong business model, with some cities reporting a higher average income per room for hostels than hotels. For example, in the city of Honolulu, Hawaii, upscale hotels are reportedly making $141 to $173 per room, while hostel rooms in the same city can bring in as much as $200 per night, due to several paying guests residing in one room. Even during the 2008 economic crisis, many hostels are reporting increased occupancy numbers in a time when hotel bookings are down.\nThough in the past, hostels have been seen as low-quality accommodation for less wealthy travellers, at least one Australian study has shown that backpackers (who typically stay at hostels) spend more than non-backpackers, due to their longer stays. Backpackers in Australia contribute nearly $3.4 billion and stay on average 34.2 nights compared to the 31 nights spent by other travellers. In New Zealand, backpackers hostels had a 13.5% share of accommodation guest/nights in 2007.\n\nAnnually the Association of Youth Travel Accommodation undertakes a review of the business operations of the hostel sector, to establish crucial business metrics and identify trends in this dynamic sector. The study is undertaken in partnership with Hostelling International and Web Reservations International.\n\nThe findings of the 2010 study included:\n\nAccording to the Youth Travel Accommodation's Annual Survey one of the main reasons for a relatively strong performance of the hostel sector is the tendency for operators to innovate and adapt their products to suit market conditions. The fact that hostel operators could generally sustain business levels through the downturn was one of the main reasons why overall average bed rates for 2009 rose by more than 3% compared with 2008.\n\nMotion pictures have generally portrayed hostels in two ways: as fun places for young people to stay (for example, \"The Journey of Jared Price\" and \"A Map for Saturday\"), or alternatively, as dangerous places where unsuspecting Americans face potential horrors in Eastern Europe (see, e.g., \"Hostel\", \"\", and \"EuroTrip\"). There are some popular misconceptions that a hostel is a kind of a flophouse, homeless shelter or halfway house.\n\n"}
{"id": "53406742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53406742", "title": "Humor on the internet", "text": "Humor on the internet\n\nThe history of humor on the Internet begins together with the Internet itself. Initially internet and its precursors, LANs and WANs, were used merely as another media to disseminate jokes and other kinds of humor, in addition to the traditional ones (\"word of mouth\", printed media, sound recording, radio, film, and TV). In lockstep with the progress of electronic communication technologies, jokers took advantage of the ARPANET, e-mail, Usenet newsgroups (e.g., rec.humor and alt.humor), bulletin board systems..., and finally the Whole World Wide Web. Gradually, new forms of humor evolved, based on the new possibilities delivered by electronic means of communication. A popular form of internet humour is found in the form of 'internet memes'. 'Memes' are almost akin to an inside joke among the internet, once a meme is overused to the point where no humour is gained from it, it is considered 'dead' or 'stale'.\n\nInternet made an impact on humor in several important ways.\n\nSimilarly to other technical innovations (from printing to TV), Internet significantly increased the speed and the extent of the propagation of humor over the world. The joke is a commonly transmitted type of internet meme. It is well-known that orally-transmitted jokes and other kind of folklore undergo evolution and mutations. Internet speeds up and globalizes these processes.\n\nA FAQ of rec.humor gave the following tongue-in-cheek description how jokes propagated in the era of newsgroups:\n\nOn the opposite side, unlike previous technical means, internet as a whole eliminates censorship and self-censorship of humor. For example, before the Internet extremely sick jokes, such as dead baby jokes, were almost exclusively spread orally.\n\nInternet blurred the lines between written and spoken in terms of language use and the directness of speech, between what is permitted in private and in public. Also, YouTube blurred the distinction between a spoken and recorded joke, in that the narrator is actually present.\n\nLimor and Lemish observe that internet humor is a part of the participatory culture, where the \"consumers\" of jokes may reciprocate by generating and transmitting humor, i.e., act as \"producers\" and \"distributors\".\n\nNew possibilities provided by electronic means of communication gave rise to new types of humor. An early example of these is humorous ASCII art. While the precursor of the ASCII art, the \"typewrite art\", has been known since 19th century, it was available to few. Whereas ASCII art, including silly one, has become ubiquitous in sig blocks in discussion boards and e-mails. One may find quite a few silly examples in the \"Jargon File\", which also mentions subgenres of ASCII art humor: puns on the letter/character names (e.g., if read \"B\" as \"bee\" and the caret character (^) as \"carrot\", the one may create an ASCII art rebus for a \"bee in a carrot patch\") and pictures of \"silly cows\" .\n\nThe ability to easily manipulate with images and videos combined with ease of the dissemination of them via the Internet introduced new forms of graphical humor, such as lolcats, demotivators, and funny animations.\n\n"}

Woods, and James Vanderbilt. A sequel to the 1996 film \"Independence Day\", it stars an ensemble cast featuring Liam Hemsworth, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Maika Monroe, Jessie Usher, Travis Tope, William Fichtner, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Judd Hirsch, Brent Spiner, and Sela Ward.\n\nThe film takes place twenty years after the events of the first film, during which the United Nations has collaborated to form Earth Space Defense (ESD), an international military defense and research organization. Through reverse engineering, the world has harnessed the power of alien technology and laid the groundwork to resist a second invasion.\n\nPlans for a sequel to \"Independence Day\" began as early as 2001, with 20th Century Fox eventually green-lighting the project in 2014. Principal photography began in April 2015 at locations primarily in New Mexico but also in the Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah, which were featured in the original. \"Independence Day: Resurgence\" was released in the United States on June 24, 2016, twenty years after the release of \"Independence Day\", in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D, grossing $389.7 million worldwide at the box office. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who found the plot convoluted and action sequences overblown, though some praised its overall humor and the visual effects.\n\nTwenty years after the devastating alien invasion, the United Nations has set up the Earth Space Defense (ESD), a global defense and research program that reverse-engineers alien technology and serves as Earth's early warning system against extraterrestrial threats. Civilization has been restored and relative peace among nations exists following the human race's victory over the aliens' attacks.\n\nAs the twentieth anniversary of the invasion approaches, ESD Director David Levinson meets with warlord Dikembe Umbutu and Dr. Catherine Marceaux in the African state Republique Nationale d'Umbutu. They travel to an intact alien city destroyer and discover that alien survivors sent a distress call to their home world before their defeat. It is revealed that former U.S. President Thomas Whitmore, Dr. Brackish Okun, and Umbutu are telepathically linked to the aliens, following personal encounters, and have visions of an unidentified spherical object.\n\nAn unidentified spherical ship emerges from a wormhole near Earth's Moon, and despite objections from Levinson, is destroyed on the orders of the United Nations Security Council. Defying orders, American pilots Jake Morrison and Charlie Miller then pick up Levinson, Marceaux, Umbutu, and U.S. federal controller Floyd Rosenberg on a space tug. They head for the wreckage in the Van de Graaff crater, where they recover a large container. An alien mothership suddenly appears, responding to the distress call, and proceeds to destroy much of the Earth's planetary defenses before landing over the North Atlantic Ocean, where it starts to drill down toward the Earth's molten core. Narrowly escaping death, those on board the space tug are able to avoid capture and return to Area 51.\n\nWhitmore, Levinson, and U.S. General Joshua Adams' groups interrogate one of the aliens held in captivity at Area 51's prison facility from the war. They learn that the aliens exist in a hivemind and that one of their colossal Queens is commanding the invasion. Levinson hypothesizes that if they kill the supervising Queen, her forces will cease drilling and go dormant. An ESD aerial fleet, led by Captain Dylan Hiller, stages a counterattack, but they are caught in a trap within the mothership, leaving only a few survivors, including Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and fellow ESD lieutenant and Chinese pilot Rain Lao.\n\nIn Area 51, Okun opens the rescued container and releases a giant white sphere of virtual intelligence. The sphere reveals that her mission is to evacuate survivors to a planet of refuge from worlds targeted by the aliens, whom she calls \"Harvesters\", and unite them in an attack on the Harvesters' planet. In the mothership, all surviving ESD pilots manage to escape by hijacking enemy craft; Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and Rain navigate two Harvester fighters to pursue the Queen's personal ship, which is heading to Area 51 to extract information from the sphere about the refugee planet.\n\nKnowing the Harvester Queen has become aware of the sphere's location, the ESD hide her in an isolation chamber and use a decoy in Jake's space tug to lure the Harvester Queen's ship into a trap. Whitmore volunteers to pilot the transport ship on a suicide mission, leading the Queen's ship into a trap before detonating a bomb, thus sacrificing himself but destroying the enemy ship. However, the Harvester Queen survives by using an energy shield and a fight breaks out. Initially, the ESD soldiers' weapons cannot penetrate the Queen's shield, but after the Harvester Queen lowers her shield to fire her own weapon, a good shot by Whitmore's daughter Patricia disables her shield. This allows Dylan's party, which arrives just in time, to ultimately kill her before she can take the sphere.\n\nWith the Queen dead, all the remaining alien fighters are rendered inactive, while the mothership stops drilling and retreats to space. Okun reveals that the sphere has asked humanity to lead her resistance and has offered them new technology in preparation for a potential counterattack on the Harvester's home world.\n\n\nThe possibility of a sequel to \"Independence Day\" had been discussed as early as 2001, and the film's producer and writer, Dean Devlin, once stated that the world's reaction to the September 11 attacks influenced him to strongly consider making a sequel to the film. Devlin began writing an outline for a script with Emmerich, but in May 2004, Emmerich said he and Devlin had attempted to \"figure out a way how to continue the story\", but that this ultimately did not work, and the pair abandoned the idea. In October 2009, Emmerich said he once again had plans for a sequel, and had since considered the idea of making two sequels to form a trilogy. On June 24, 2011, Devlin confirmed that he and Emmerich had found an idea for the sequels and had written a treatment for it. In October 2011, however, discussions for Will Smith returning were halted, due to Fox's refusal to provide the $50 million salary demanded by Smith for the two sequels. Emmerich, however, made assurances that the films would be shot back-to-back, regardless of Smith's involvement. In July 2012, Devlin reiterated that the \"Independence Day\" sequel was still in development, and the script would take place in 2012, 16 years after the original film's events.\n\nIn March 2013, Emmerich stated that the titles of the new films would be \"ID: Forever – Part I\" and \"ID: Forever – Part II\". The films will take place twenty years after the original, when reinforcements of the original alien species arrive at Earth after finally receiving a distress call. The new films will focus on the next generation of heroes, including the stepson of Smith's character in the original film. In May 2013, Emmerich and Devlin mentioned that wormholes would be used as a plot device in \"ID: Forever\". On May 29, 2014, it was announced that the script for the first sequel written by Emmerich and Devlin would be rewritten by Carter Blanchard. The script was delivered to Fox along with twenty previsualization shots produced under effects supervisor Volker Engel, a long-time collaborator of Emmerich. On November 26, 2014, Deadline confirmed that Fox had greenlit the single film, and they were in talks with Emmerich to direct the film, while casting was reported to begin after Emmerich's confirmation. The full title, \"Independence Day: Resurgence\", was revealed on June 22, 2015. \"Returns\", \"Retaliation\", \"Rises\", and \"Requiem\" were all considered too along with the title before settling with \"Resurgence\". Emmerich explained that in the sequel, the alien invaders that were likened in the original to locusts \"are more like bees\", with a hive mentality and only interested in multiplying, \"and when they arrive it's more like a natural disaster than an invasion.\"\n\nEarly on, both Emmerich and Devlin hoped that Smith would return. However, in June 2013, Emmerich announced that Smith would not be returning, noting that \"he's too expensive.\" Smith later stated that he declined the role due to scheduling conflicts with \"Suicide Squad\", also in production at the time. Smith's absence in the movie is explained with the death of his character, Steven Hiller, who had been promoted to colonel, 11 years after the events of the first film when personally testing the first experimental prototype fighter designed with alien technology for the ESD. Later in June, it was officially confirmed that both Goldblum and Pullman would return in the sequel, and that a gay character would be featured. After \"Resurgence\"'s release, reviewers with an interest in LGBT issues accused the film of under-delivering on this commitment.\n\nOn January 27, 2015, casting began with Fox offering the lead role to Liam Hemsworth. French-British actress Charlotte Gainsbourg was in talks to join the film's cast, revealed by THR on March 20, 2015. Newcomer Travis Tope was set on March 25, 2015 to play the role of Charlie. On March 3, 2015, Emmerich confirmed via Twitter that Vivica A. Fox would reprise the role of Jasmine Dubrow, her character from the previous film. That same day, Jessie Usher was added to the cast to portray the role of the stepson of Smith's character. Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman were also set to reprise their roles from the previous film. Maika Monroe signed on to star in the film on April 27, 2015. She would play the daughter of the former President after Mae Whitman, who played the character in the original movie, declined to read for the part, according to Emmerich. Monroe was selected from a shortlist that included Gabriella Wilde, Britt Robertson, Merritt Patterson and Lucy Boynton. Sela Ward's casting as the new President of the United States was confirmed on May 4, 2015. On May 13, 2015, Mckenna Grace also joined the film to play Daisy. On May 19, 2015, Patrick St. Esprit was cast as Secretary of Defense Tanner. On May 29, 2015, William Fichtner was cast as a General, a role that will be larger in the next two films. The casting of Angelababy was announced on Twitter by Emmerich on June 3, 2015.\n\nFilming began on April 20, 2015, and wrapped on August 22, 2015. Filming for additional scenes also took place in early 2016 in Los Angeles. Some scenes were also filmed in West Wendover, Nevada, London, at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, and Singapore's Marina Bay Sands. Due to the availability of regional filming, the producers decided to shoot the film largely in New Mexico. Moreover, the state offers a 25% movie tax credit. However, while location filming did take place in rural New Mexico and further north on the Utah and Nevada border, most of the shooting was studio-based. Albuquerque Studios was a major venue for the film in which \"\" and \"The Lone Ranger\" were also filmed. The film was shot on Red Dragon anamorphic cameras in 6K resolution, being later stereo converted.\nEmmerich decided to return to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, which he said he fell in love with while looking for a unique location for shooting the first film. However, problems cropped up as Emmerich was slightly disappointed by the nature and color of the area. This was because prior to the arrival of the crew, a windstorm had occurred around the area, which blew a lot of dirt into the salt and subsequently turned it into a shade of beige.\n\nThe filmmakers refrained from shooting in India or portraying any prominent Indian monuments as being damaged to avoid potential protests and legal action from Indian religious groups and activists. Originally, Dubai was planned to land on Paris in the scene depicting the mothership destroying Europe while using Asian monuments pulled out by its gravitational pull. However, following the November 2015 Paris attacks, filmmakers reconsidered and instead had Dubai land on London. Emmerich said, \"After the attacks, we felt it wasn't right to have the Burj Khalifa crashing on the Eiffel Tower, so we dumped it on the London Eye instead. The English can take it.\"\n\nLike the original \"Independence Day\", \"Resurgence\" had its visual effects led by supervisor Volker Engel and producer Marc Weigert from Uncharted Territory, LLC. Like with Emmerich's \"White House Down\", the Ncam camera tracking system was used on set to provide animation previews to the cast and crew and gather data for the effects companies. While the original film relied heavily on miniatures and Engel wanted them on at least one scene, the effects were mostly computer-generated \"which was pretty much less than half of the budget\". Uncharted Territory, along with coordinating the overall efforts of 15 effects houses, was the leading company with 268 shots, created in a tight collaboration with the film's art department. Scanline VFX was the first vendor hired, and handled the mothership landing, which included creating detailed models of London and Singapore out of thousands of reference photographs and even Lidar scans to realistically destroy both cities. Weta Digital was mainly responsible for the design of the aliens and carrying out the climactic battle scene.\n\nThe film's music was composed by Thomas Wander and Harald Kloser. The soundtrack also contains \"Electric U\", performed by Kid Bloom and \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\", performed by Annie Trousseau. The soundtrack was released on June 17, 2016 by Sony Classical Records. Much of the themes and style of David Arnold, who worked on the score for first film, was kept.\n\n\"Independence Day: Resurgence\" premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on June 20, 2016. The film was originally going to be released on July 3, 2015 but on November 12, 2013, it was announced that the sequel had been rescheduled for a July 2016 release. On October 14, 2014, Fox changed the release date to June 24, 2016. It was released in certain formats such as 3D, IMAX 3D, and premium large formats.\n\nTitan Books published several tie-in books for the film, including novels and comics. The first, an omnibus of Stephen Molstad's three \"Independence Day\" novels, \"Silent Zone\", \"War in the Desert\", and the novelization of \"Independence Day\", was released on March 19, 2016. The second, \"Independence Day: Crucible\", was written by Greg Keyes. \"Crucible\" serves as a prequel to the film and was published on May 24, 2016. A novelization of \"Independence Day: Resurgence\" by Alex Irvine followed on June 21 before the film's release and it differs from the film in that the character of the President survives most of the alien conflict as a prisoner of the Harvester Queen and is killed when the ship is destroyed, instead of being killed when the aliens attack the fortified bunker in Colorado and it also reveals - in POV exposition, during the scene where the Queen captures the sphere - that the sphere aliens are responsible for the creation of the Harvester aliens, who turned on them and wiped them out, though this plot device is not further explored in the book and may not be considered canon in any further films since it was not used in the final film. Titan Comics started a six issue comic book miniseries, \"Independence Day: Dark Fathom\", written by Victor Gischler, with art by Tazio Bettin, which serves as a prequel set between the first and second films, and which began its run on March 23 and ended on June 15.\n\nOn December 13, 2015, the first trailer was released by 20th Century Fox. A TV spot was shown during Super Bowl 50 on February 7, 2016. A commercial for the U.S. Army aired promoting the film by presenting itself as a commercial for the ESD, or Earth Space Defense, a fictional military faction dedicated to defending the Earth against any further alien invasion.\n\nIn June 2016, 20th Century Fox's British division collaborated with Manchester United, of which 20th Century Fox is the official film partner, for a commercial featuring Jeff Goldblum and Angelababy, and guest-starring United players Chris Smalling, Daley Blind, Ashley Young, Juan Mata and captain Wayne Rooney as fighter pilots.\n\nIn Japan, 20th Century Fox collaborated with Sunrise to cross-promote the film with \"Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn\". One of the film's posters has the Statue of Liberty replaced with the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam aiming at the alien mothership, while a TV spot features commentary by \"Gundam Unicorn\" characters Banagher Links and Full Frontal.\n\n\"Independence Day: Resurgence\" was released on Digital HD on September 27, 2016, and on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray,and DVD on October 18, 2016 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. It topped the No. 1 spot in the Blu-ray Disc sales charts.\n\n\"Independence Day: Resurgence\" was unable to duplicate the success of its predecessor, which grossed $817.4 million worldwide in 1996. It was not even one of the top-grossing films of 2016 or of its month of release, due to \"Finding Dory\" being the highest-grossing film of June. The film also failed to garner much support from China – the world's second biggest movie market – as the cinemagoers there complained about how little screen time there was for Chinese actress Angelababy. Moreover, the film was released in a crowded summer during the \"sequelitis\" where numerous major sequels underperformed. The film has grossed $103.1 million in the United States and Canada and $286.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $389.7 million (53% less than the first film), against a production budget of $165 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"Independence Day: Resurgence\" was released on June 24, 2016 and was projected to gross $45–65 million in its opening weekend. It opened across 4,130 theaters, which includes 3,242 3D locations, 386 IMAX theaters and 450 premium large format. It made $4 million in Thursday-night previews from 3,200 theaters, and $16.8 million on its first day (including previews), compared to the first film's $11.1 million. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $41 million, less than the $50.2 million debut of the original, finishing in second place at the box office, behind the animated \"Finding Dory\" which was on its second week of play. IMAX made up $5 million of the film's opening numbers from 365 theaters. It dropped enormously on its second Friday by 72.1% earning $4.7 million. In its second weekend the film fell by 59.3%, despite the Independence Day holiday frame, earning $16 million. After falling well below studio expectations, it was considered \"a box office disappointment\" by analysts.\n\nInternationally, the film fared better and was released across 58 countries – 73.5% of its total marketplace – where it earned a five-day total of $99.5 million on 21,872 screens, which fell more or less in line with its $100–150 million opening projections. It took the number one spot in 40 of those markets. It performed exceptionally well in IMAX, where it recorded the biggest IMAX international opening for Fox, with $10.8 million from 533 IMAX theaters, breaking \"Deadpool\"s previous record of $8.1 million the same year. In its second weekend, it grossed an additional $39 million from 64 markets and on just under 17,686 screens, down 60% from its first weekend while maintaining the top spot. It topped the international box office for two consecutive weekends before falling into fourth place in its third weekend behind \"\", \"Finding Dory\" and \"The Legend of Tarzan\".\n\nIts highest international tallies were recorded in China ($37.3 million), Mexico ($11.5 million), South Korea ($7.3 million), the United Kingdom and Ireland ($7.3 million), and Taiwan ($3.7 million). It scored the biggest ever opening for Fox in India with $3.5 million. In United Kingdom and Ireland, it debuted in second place, behind \"The Secret Life of Pets\" during a week when Brexit happened. Fox also reported \"terrific\" results across Asia and Latin America, with numerous markets generating the biggest opening weekend ever for a Roland Emmerich film. In Japan, with an opening of $6.4 million, the film recorded the biggest Saturday and Sunday opening for Fox since \"\" in 2005, besting even \"Avatar\" by 5%. In China, where the film received overwhelmingly negative reviews, it managed to record the fourth biggest Fox opening ever and came in second place, behind \"Now You See Me 2\", after a close race between the two. However, it did set the record for the biggest IMAX opening for Fox there, where it took in $6.4 million at 294 IMAX sites, surpassing \"The Martian\". It is expected to earn $90–153 million in China, which could eclipse Emmerich's previous biggest film there, \"2012\" ($68.6 million). It has so far grossed a total of $66.15 million in two weeks there.\n\nIn terms of total earnings, the biggest markets outside North America are China ($75.3 million), Japan ($25.03 million), Germany ($16.5 million), the United Kingdom ($15.7 million), Mexico ($14.1 million), and South Korea ($11.2 million).\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 30% based on 204 reviews and an average rating of 4.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"It's undeniably visually impressive, but like its predecessor, \"Independence Day: Resurgence\" lacks enough emotional heft to support its end-of-the-world narrative stakes.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 32 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRichard Roeper gave the film one and a half out of four stars, writing, \"The \"Resurgence\" blueprint calls for a scene in which characters have human, allegedly humorous and/or touching moments; a scene in which characters plot strategy against the aliens; and a big action sequence in which it's often difficult to tell the difference between the good-guy spaceships and the bad-guy spaceships. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.\" Mike Ryan of \"Uproxx\" gave the film a negative review, saying, \"This should be dumb fun. It's just dumb.\" Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" gave the film 1/5 stars, describing it as a \"planet-smashingly boring sci-fi sequel.\" Dave Palmer of \"The Reel Deal\" gave the film 2/10, saying, \"The final shot of the film is a set up for another sequel, and I just pray to God aliens come and wipe us out before that day comes.\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of \"The A.V. Club\" criticized the film as an example of Hollywood's current business model of \"preemptive franchising,\" stating that \"The movie's dips into all-out space opera (interstellar travel, more alien species, etc.) are only meant to get the audience pumped for a movie that doesn't yet exist, making the undistinguished climax seem like a skirmish.\" Robbie Collin of \"The Telegraph\" gave it 2/5 stars, saying it shows \"no signs of intelligent life.\" Sandie Angulo Chen of \"Common Sense Media\" says that the film \"isn't going to wow anyone who's seen the original,\" and it may satisfy younger audiences who care about the battle sequences, \"but overall this isn't a satisfying sequel.\"\n\nDan Jolin of \"Empire\" gave the film a positive review, saying it was \"spectacular as you'd hope from a sequel to the 1996 planet-toaster, and as amusingly cheesy. You'll enjoy yourself enough that you won't even miss Will Smith.\" Guy Lodge of \"Variety\" gave the film a positive review, calling it \"a silly but spectacular sequel\". Lucy O'Brien of \"IGN\" gave the film an 8/10, saying, \"a silly, cheesy, spectacle-driven blockbuster with heart, \"Independence Day: Resurgence\" is a refreshing antidote to the grim and the serious sentiment we've seen trending in sci-fi flicks of recent years. While its plot is messy and it's stuffed with too many characters, I dare you not to leave the theatre with a guilt-free smile on your face.\" Also rating the film an 8/10 was Jack Bottomley of \"Starburst\", who wrote \"Emmerich's film is stupid and entertaining and sometimes stupidly entertaining but unlike his misfires \"10,000 BC\" and \"Godzilla\", it realises this fact and embraces it as a facet of the movie's character, taking its popcorn-munching entertainment to ridiculous levels in terms of grand scale and enjoyment.\" Ealasaid A. Haas of \"The Mercury News\" gave the film a mediocre review, saying that \"It was okay.\"\n\nThe film was nominated by the Alliance of Women Film Journalists for Most Egregious Age Difference Between The Lead and The Love Interest Award (for Charlotte Gainsbourg and Jeff Goldblum), and the Remake or Sequel That Shouldn't Have Been Made.\nThe Houston Film Critics Society in its 2016 awards, nominated it for the Worst Film award.\nIn the 37th ceremony of the Golden Raspberry Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Director (Roland Emmerich), Worst Screenplay (Nicolas Wright, James A. Woods, Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich and James Vanderbilt), Worst Supporting Actress (Sela Ward), and Worst Prequel, Remake, Ripoff or Sequel.\n\nIn June 2016, during an interview with \"Empire\" magazine, Emmerich stated that a third film could be made, depending on the success of the second one. He also said that audiences would not have to wait as long as they did for the second in the series. According to Emmerich, the third film will depict an intergalactic journey, possibly set a year or two later since he wants to maintain the same group of people, especially the young characters. \n\nIn March 2018, LRM Online reported that, after having met producer Dean Devlin at WonderCon and asking about the status of \"Independence Day 3\", Devlin told them \"I don't know. I don't know. Currently, I personally have no plans of doing another one.\" Following this, Ryan Scott at Movie Web translated the poor reception of the second film and Devlin comments as meaning \"Independence Day 3\" will likely not happen, also noting that 21st Century Fox merging with The Walt Disney Company (meaning Disney will be in control of Fox's franchises) would make it even less likely that a third film would be pursued and that we may not see another reboot of the brand for another 15-20 years.\n\n\n"}

She sang in Austria, Germany, England, South America and the Caribbean, making her home in San Francisco where, in the 1870s, she was the most important musical personality and \"prima donna assoluta\" of her time, performing in more than 150 concerts and operas from 1872 to 1879, producing operas, and teaching voice to up-and-coming singers.\n\nShe was the daughter of an impoverished Viennese textile manufacturer. She made a successful operatic debut in Kassa, Hungary, (now Košice, Slovakia) as Abigail in Donizetti's \"Lucrezia Borgia\" in 1847. After a few years on the road singing in Königsberg (1856–1857) and Potsdam (1857), she arrived at the Hamburgischerer Stadttheater where, among other roles, she received recognition for Valentine in Meyerbeer's \"Les Huguenots\" which became one of her starring roles.\n\nHere she met Richard Mulder (1822–1874), a Dutch musician and impresario whom she married in 1858. He organized a tour to South America (1858–59) during which time she sang in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. From then on she would use her stage name, \"Fabbri\" (Italian for \"Schmidt/Smith\").\n\nIn 1860, she was engaged by Max Maretzek to sing at his Winter Garden Theatre in New York. Her highly acclaimed American debut was as Violetta in Verdi's \"La Traviata\". Shortly thereafter, she sang Elvira in Ernani in which \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"she was more dramatic and powerful\" [than in her role as Violetta] and \"a dramatic actress of the first class\". \"Mme. Fabbri was called out twice after each act, and the finale to the third act was encored.\"\n\nHer debut at the Winter Garden was followed by tours in the American Mid-West, Canada and the Caribbean Islands. She was especially well received in Puerto Rico but lost all her possessions in a fire. In 1862–1863, she and her husband returned to Europe on a tour. From May 1863 to March 1864, she sang thirty-seven performances at the Wiener Hofoper in roles which included Elvira and Leonore in Verdi's \"Ernani\" and \"Il Trovatore\", Raquel in Halévy's \"La Juive\", and Alice and Berthe in Meyerbeer's \"Robert le diable\" and \"Le Prophète\".\n\nFrom 1864–1871 they lived in Frankfurt am Main where Fabbri was engaged to sing at the Stadttheater in roles which included Elisabeth in Wagner's \"Tannhäuser\". She was described by critics at this time as a soprano with a strong, clear voice suitable for both coloratura and dramatic roles. After a guest performance at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, she returned to New York in 1872 for an engagement with the Habelmann-Formes opera company.\n\nIn 1872, she went to San Francisco with the company where she sang at the California Theatre. She and her husband settled there and from 1873 to 1874 they produced forty-three operas, staging the first production of \"Die Zauberflöte\" in the city. Her husband founded a music school in San Francisco which she took over on his death in 1874. She continued to give concerts and to produce operas, many of which she performed in herself. From 1875 to 1876 she directed and sang in sixty operas. Her repertoire included some forty-six different roles.\n\nOn 17 January 1876, she inaugurated the new opera house, later renamed the Grand Opera House, in \"Snow Flake! And The Seven Pigmies\".\n\nIn 1878, she married, secondly, the baritone Jacob Müller (or Muller), a former student of her late husband. In 1881, she ended her singing career but continued her activities as an impresaria. After large financial losses she lived in Los Angeles from 1891 but later returned to San Francisco where she again lost her assets in a fire believed to be arson. In 1901, her second husband died. In 1905 she produced an opera for the last time.\n\nShe died in San Francisco, California in 1909, aged 78. Her archives are housed at the University of California, Berkeley.\n"}
{"id": "1041183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1041183", "title": "Jack and Jill (dance)", "text": "Jack and Jill (dance)\n\nJack and Jill is a format of competition in partner dancing, where the competing couples are the result of random matching of leaders and followers. Rules of matching vary. \n\nThe name and format were created by Jack Carey at Hank & Stans in Norwalk, California in the early 1950s to encourage a variety of dancers to enter competitions. \nThe gender-ambiguous term \"Pat and Chris\" has been used, particularly in LGBT dance venues, to refer to events where the gender of lead and follow isn't specified.\n\nIn dance competitions J&J is included as a separate division (or divisions, with additional gradations).\nJ&J is popular at Swing conventions, as well as at ballroom dance competitions in the US.\n\nJ&J competitions are intended to test social dance skills, whereas fixed partner competitions test performance dance skills.\n\nRules vary, depending on country and dance style.\n\nIn the UK, it is normal to randomly assign fixed couples, and then keep those couples fixed throughout the competition (for example, if there are multiple rounds). Thus, the winner is largely decided by luck of the draw, with the winning couple often being regular dance partners who were lucky enough to be paired together. As a result, DWAS competitions are not taken as seriously as fixed partner competitions.\n\nIn the US, Jack & Jill contests are extremely popular in the national West Coast Swing and Lindy Hop communities. Rules vary in events across the country but three rules seem to be standard in most Jack & Jill contests: 1) no choreography is allowed, 2) no costumes are allowed, and 3) no lifts or drops are allowed. However, at the Champion or Invitational level, event organizers will occasionally opt for an \"anything goes\" Jack & Jill in which no rules apply. Music for each dance is selected at random without the participants' prior knowledge, though some competitions will allow them to select the tempo (speed) or a sub-style within their dance's music (e.g. Blues or contemporary within West Coast Swing). \n\nAlthough it is not the case in \"every\" Jack & Jill contest, it is somewhat typical for dancers to be judged individually, then dancers who make any elimination rounds redraw for new partners. Depending on rules specific to the event/competition, a Jack & Jill competitor may or may not be allowed to dance with their regular competition partner (one that they compete with in a choreographed division). At some events/competitions they are required to redraw; and some events that don't have the redraw rule give dancers the option to decline if they draw their regular competition partner but do not \"require\" them to do so. Some dancers who draw their regular [choreographed division] partner see this \"luck\" as more of a competition handicap, feeling that the crowd and possibly the judges will more closely scrutinize them, expecting even more of their competition performance than competitors who do not draw their regular partners.\n\nOne of the key elements of a Jack & Jill contest in the US West Coast Swing and Lindy Hop communities is the element of improvisation, which is why choreography is not allowed. This improv-based feature can prove to be extremely entertaining as dancers try to coordinate dancing with this new partner while dancing to the specific characteristics of a random song or \"expressing musicality\". Since the spirit of improvisation can possibly be dampened by the dancers having drawn their partner, it is often more difficult for the dancers to perform to the expectations of the spectators and the judges. Some dancers, however, are able to perform at or above the expectations depending on various factors, usually unpredictable factors such as the song, the consistency of the dance floor, or even just the simple factor of how they feel at that particular time. This can be compared to the American football adage \"(on) Any Given Sunday\".\n"}

The game is played on a 7×9 board and is popular with children in the Far East. The game is also known as The Jungle Game, Children's Chess, Oriental Chess, and Animal Chess. \n\nJungle is a two-player strategy game and has been cited as resembling the Western game \"Stratego\", but \"Stratego\" actually has more in common with another Chinese board game known as Jun Qi ().\n\nThe Jungle gameboard represents a jungle terrain with dens, traps \"set\" around dens, and rivers. Each player controls eight game pieces representing different animals of various rank. Stronger-ranked animals can capture (\"eat\") animals of weaker or equal rank.

An alternative way to win is to capture all the opponent's pieces.\n\nThe Jungle , usually made of paper, consists of seven and nine of squares (7×9 rectangle = 63 squares). Pieces move on the squares as in chess, not on the grid lines as in xiangqi. Pictures of eight animals and their names appear on each side of the board to indicate initial placement of the game pieces. After initial setup, these designated squares have no special meaning in the .\n\nThere are several special squares and areas of the Jungle board: \n\nEach player has eight game pieces representing different animals, each with a different rank, and in their own colour (blue versus red). The animal ranking, from strongest to weakest, is:\n\nPieces start on squares with pictures corresponding to their animal, which are invariably shown on the Jungle board.\n\nPlayers alternate moves with Blue moving first. During their turn, a player must move. All pieces can move one square horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). A piece may not move into its own den. Animals of either side can move into and out of any trap square. \n\nThere are special rules related to the \"water squares\":\n\nAnimals capture opponent pieces by \"killing/eating\" them (the attacking piece the captured piece on its square; the captured piece is removed from the game). A piece can capture any enemy piece that has the same or lower rank, with the following exceptions:\n\n\nThere are some commonly played variations, as follows:\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

{"id": "82345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82345", "title": "Mockumentary", "text": "Mockumentary\n\nA mockumentary (a portmanteau of mock and documentary) or docucomedy is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary.\n\nThese productions are often used to analyze or comment on current events and issues by using a fictional setting, or to parody the documentary form itself. While mockumentaries are usually comedic, pseudo-documentaries are their dramatic equivalents. However, pseudo-documentary should not be confused with docudrama, a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events. Also, docudrama is different from docufiction; a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements.\n\nMockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries, with B roll and talking heads discussing past events, or as \"cinéma vérité\" pieces following people as they go through various events. Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became relatively easy to locate. A very early example was a short piece on the \"Swiss Spaghetti Harvest\" that appeared as an April fools' joke on the British television program \"Panorama\" in 1957.\n\nThe term \"mockumentary\", which originated in the 1960s, was popularized in the mid-1980s when \"This Is Spinal Tap\" director Rob Reiner used it in interviews to describe that film.\n\nMockumentaries are often partly or wholly improvised, as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretense of reality. Comedic mockumentaries rarely have laugh tracks, also to sustain the atmosphere, although exceptions exist.\n\nMusic \"is often employed to expose the ambiguities and fallacies of conventional storytelling; for instance by pointing at the paradoxes of the distinction between diegetic and extradiegetic music\".\n\nEarly work, including Luis Buñuel's 1933 \"Land Without Bread\", Orson Welles's 1938 radio broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds\", various April Fools' Day news reports, and \"vérité\"-style film and television during the 1960s and 1970s, served as precursor to the genre. Early examples of mock-documentaries include \"The Connection\" (1961), \"A Hard Day's Night\", 1964, (written by Alun Owen, purporting to describe several days in the lives of The Beatles, that would be the first feature-length mockumentary), \"David Holzman's Diary\", 1967, \"Pat Paulsen for President\", 1968, \"Take the Money and Run\", 1969, \"The Clowns\", 1970, by Federico Fellini (a peculiar hybrid of documentary and fiction, a docufiction), and \"All You Need Is Cash\", 1978. Albert Brooks was also an early popularizer of the mockumentary style with his film \"Real Life\", 1979, a spoof of a PBS documentary.\n\nWoody Allen's \"Take the Money and Run\" is presented in documentary-style with Allen playing a fictional criminal, Virgil Starkwell, whose crime exploits are \"explored\" throughout the film. Jackson Beck, who used to narrate documentaries in the 1940s, provides the voice-over narration. Fictional interviews are interspliced throughout, especially those of Starkwell's parents who wear Groucho Marx noses and mustaches. The style of this film was widely appropriated by others and revisited by Allen himself in films such as \"Zelig\" (1983) and \"Sweet and Lowdown\" (1999).\n\nEarly use of the mockumentary format in television comedy may be seen in several sketches from \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" (1969–1974), such as \"Hell's Grannies\", \"Piranha Brothers\", and \"The Funniest Joke in the World\". \"The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour\" (1970–1971) also featured mockumentary pieces which interspersed both scripted and real-life man-in-the-street interviews, the most famous likely being \"The Puck Crisis\" in which hockey pucks were claimed to have become infected with a form of Dutch elm disease.\n\n\"All You Need Is Cash\", developed from an early series of sketches in the comedy series \"Rutland Weekend Television\", is a 1978 television film in mockumentary style about \"The Rutles\", a fictional band that parodies \"The Beatles\".\n\nSince the beginning of the 1980s, the mockumentary format has got considerable attention. The 1980 South African film \"The Gods Must be Crazy\" (along with its 1989 sequel) is presented in the manner of a nature documentary, with documentary narrator Paddy O'Byrne describing the events of the film in the manner of a biologist or anthropologist presenting scientific knowledge to viewers. In 1982, \"The Atomic Cafe\" is a Cold-War era American \"mockumentary\" film that made use of archival government footage from the 1950s. Woody Allen's 1983 film \"Zelig\" stars Allen as a curiously nondescript enigma who is discovered for his remarkable ability to transform himself to resemble anyone he is near, and Allen is edited into historical archive footage. In 1984, Christopher Guest co-wrote and starred in the mockumentary \"This is Spinal Tap\", directed by Rob Reiner. Guest went on to write and direct other mockumentaries including \"Waiting for Guffman\", \"Best in Show\", and \"A Mighty Wind\", all written with costar Eugene Levy.\n\nTim Robbins' 1992 film \"Bob Roberts\" was a mockumentary centered around the senatorial campaign of a right-wing stock trader and folksinger, and the unsavory connections and dirty tricks used to defeat a long-term liberal incumbent played by Gore Vidal. \"Man Bites Dog\" is a 1992 Belgian black comedy crime mockumentary written, produced, and directed by Rémy Belvaux, André Bonzel, and Benoît Poelvoorde. In 1995, Peter Jackson and Costa Botes directed \"Forgotten Silver\", which claimed New Zealand \"director\" Colin McKenzie was a pioneer in filmmaking. When the film was later revealed to be a mockumentary, Jackson received criticism for tricking viewers. In 1998, director Mike Clattenburg wrote and directed a short film titled \"One Last Shot,\" which was shot in black-and-white. The film followed the exploits, in documentary style, of Ricky (Robb Wells) and Julian (John Paul Tremblay), two criminals doing what they did just about every day. In 1999 a sequel feature film \"Trailer Park Boys,\" also in black-and-white, was released. Both films serve as prequels to the \"Trailer Park Boys\" television series. In 1999, \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\" by Michael Patrick Jann used the mockumentary style to narrate a fictional small-town beauty pageant as a way to satirize Middle America.\n\n\"Dark Side of the Moon\" is a 2002 French mockumentary by director William Karel. The premise for the film is the theory that the television footage from the Apollo 11 Moon landing was faked and actually recorded in a studio by the CIA with help from director Stanley Kubrick. \"FUBAR\" is a 2002 Canadian mockumentary film, directed by Michael Dowse, based on the lives of two lifelong friends and head-bangers living out their lives, constantly drinking beer. \"King of Bollywood\" is a 2004 film, in fact, the first Indian film in the mockumentary genre. Directed by Piyush Jha it starred the late Om Puri and British supermodel Sophie Dahl. It tells the story of an aging Bollywood Superstar and showcases the hilarity, colour, and zany-ness of his many comeback attempts. \"\" is a 2004 mockumentary presenting an alternative history in which the Confederacy won the American Civil War. \n\n\"First on the Moon\" (Russian: Первые на Луне, \"Pervye na Lune\") is a 2005 Russian mockumentary about a fictional 1930s Soviet landing on the Moon. \"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\" is a controversial yet successful film from 2006 which uses this style, as does \"Brüno\", a similar film from 2009. Sony Pictures Animation released their second animated feature, \"Surf's Up\" in 2007, which was the first of its kind to incorporate the mockumentary style into animation. \"REC\", a 2007 Spanish film by Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza, uses journalism aesthetics to approach a horror universe set up in a real building in Barcelona. The film was remade in the United States as the 2008 film \"Quarantine\". As the first installment of the \"REC film series\", it was followed by three sequels; \"REC 2\" in 2009, \"\" in 2012, and \"REC 4\" in 2014.\n\n\"On the Ropes\" is a 2011 mockumentary film written and directed by Mark Noyce. The film follows a fictional martial-arts instructor and his rivalry with a local boxing gym. \"The Dirties\" is a 2013 comedy mockumentary film written and directed by Matt Johnson. Johnson also directed the film \"Operation Avalanche\" (2016), a mockumentary about a faked moon landing. \"What We Do In The Shadows\" is a 2014 horror/comedy mockumentary film directed and written by Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement; the aforementioned directors also star in the production. The film is centered on vampire flatmates living in Wellington. \"\" is a 2016 mockumentary musical comedy starring Andy Samberg as Connor4Real, an over-the-top parody of a commercial pop star. It is filmed in the style of a typical concert documentary such as \"\" and \"\". \"Population Zero\" (2016) a mockumentary environmental scare film starring activism film maker Julian T. Pinder. \"We Make Movies\" (2017) is a \"Making-of\" mockumentary that follows an egotistical student filmmaker as he gathers his friends to help him make a movie for their local film festival.\n\nThe 1983 \"The Comic Strip Presents...\" film \"Bad News Tour\" was a spoof rockumentary about a British heavy metal band. It preceded \"Spinal Tap\" by a year, but is not known to have been an influence on the U.S. film. The film led to LPs being released and the band really touring, and was followed by a sequel, \"More Bad News\" in 1987.\n\"Stella Street\" was a mockumentary which ran on the BBC from 1997 to 2001. It was written by Phil Cornwell, John Sessions, and Peter Richardson, and featured Cornwell and Sessions playing all the characters between them. The series was shot on handheld camcorders. \"Operation Good Guys\", another low-budget BBC sitcom, ran for three series starting in 1997.\n\nIn television, the most notable mockumentaries in the 2000s have been: ABC Australia's \"The Games\" (1998–2000), Canadian series \"Trailer Park Boys\" (2001–present), the British shows \"Marion and Geoff\" (2000), \"Twenty Twelve\" (2011–2012) (which follows the fictional Olympic Deliverance Commission in the run-up to the 2012 Summer Olympic Games) and W1A, which follows the main characters of Twenty Twelve as they start work at the BBC, \"The Office\" (2001) and its many international offshoots, \"Come Fly with Me\" (2010), which follows the activity at a fictional airport and its variety of staff and passengers. British comedy duo Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French often presented short mockumentaries as extended sketches in their TV show \"French & Saunders\". Discovery Channel opened its annual Shark Week on 4 Aug 2013 with \"\", a mockumentary about the survival of the megalodon. Notable popular examples include sitcoms \"Trailer Park Boys\" and its films (1998–present),\"The Office (U.S.)\" (2005–2013), \"Parks and Recreation\" (2009–2015), and \"Modern Family\" (2009–present); the American improv comedy \"Reno 911!\" (2003–2009); the comedy series \"The Muppets\" (2015); the UK streaming sitcom \"Derek\" (2012–2014); the Australian Chris Lilley shows \"Angry Boys\", \"Summer Heights High\", \"\", \"\", and \"Jonah from Tonga\".\n\nThe series \"Documentary Now!\" (2015–present) on IFC, created by \"Saturday Night Live\" alumni, spoofs celebrated documentary films by parodying the style and subject of each documentary. Hight argues that television is a natural medium for mockumentary, as it provides \"for extraordinarily rich sources of appropriation and commentary\" .\n\nThe BBC series \"People Like Us\" was first produced for radio in 1995 before a television version was made in 1999.\n\n\n\n"}

The phrase generally refers to a section of the closing credits of films, listing the babies' given names. The custom of publishing lists of production babies began with animated films, and is still chiefly found in that genre, reflecting the influence of family experiences on storytelling in such films.\n\nThe first list of production babies was included by Pixar in the credits of their first full-length movie \"Toy Story\" in 1995.\n\nLee Unkrich, a film director with Pixar, explains that the production team and film crew indelibly associate the birth of each of their children with the film they were working on at the time. The listing in the end credits becomes a way for them to share these essential memories more widely. \"It's like our family lives are permanently woven into the movies.\" Twists added in film credits include a list of \"Chameleon Babies\" at the end of the 2010 animated film \"Tangled\", born to the real-life model for the pet in the film. The 2011 animated film \"Winnie the Pooh\" lists the names under \"Pooh Babies,\" with the credit knitted on a piece of fabric by the character Kanga.\n\nDisney film director Byron Howard cites the listing of production babies as a pointer to the depth of personal relationships established during collaboration on an animated movie.\n\nA star next to a baby's name honors a baby who passed away before production was complete.\n\nIn 2009, Ari Folman dedicated his Golden Globe Award to the eight production babies born during the making of \"Waltz with Bashir\", an animated anti-war documentary, and expressed hope that their lives would have no contact with the realities of conflict depicted in the film.\n\nReviewers have noted that \"production babies\" credits indicate the creativity of film people in giving some unusual names to their children.\n\nAn early, isolated instance in video games occurred with an easter egg message embedded in the ROM for the 1988 game \"Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball\" for Mattel Intellivision. The modern custom spread to video game credits in the 2005 game \"Call of Duty 2\", and the 2009 game \"\", which also listed the other parents.

The first commercial radio station, \"Radio HRN\", began broadcasting in 1933.\n\nIn August 1920 a group known as \"Los Chicos del Coliseo\" began broadcasting from Teatro Coliseo in Buenos Aires, but it would take many years for radio to arrive in places such as the isthmus of Central America. In Honduras, radio experimentation had begun with local transmissions. American companies (known as \"bananeras\") were just a few of the companies providing employment before and after World War II. \n\nIn 1928 the Tela Railroad Company (one of the two major railroads) had received a license to establish a radio station (known as Tropical Radio). It broadcast on the 51-meter shortwave band, and HRB (\"La Voz del Trópico\") was the first radio station in Honduras. HRB was not a \"commercial\" radio station. It was a medium for the Tela Railroad Company to broadcast its own bulletins. \n\nIt also played recorded music and featured live performances by local talent (including the Sisters Cordova and pianist Guadalupe Ferrari Hartling), marimba bands, singers, poets and other artists. HRB did not last long, but it inspired several individuals to keep the broadcasting flame alive.\n\nRafael Ferrari Garcia, an entrepreneur with great ambitions but little money, sold everything he owned to embark on a risky plan; he received permission to install the first commercial radio station in Tegucigalpa. It was known as \"La Voz del Comercio\"; to maintain its operation, he obtained commercial sponsorship from local businesses (retail and professional) and government agencies. From this HRN (\"La Primera Emisora del País\") was born; Ferrari was credited as the first radio personality in Honduras. \n\nThe station was founded on November 1, 1933. Kenneth See and Paul John were the principal technical engineers and attorney Manuel Bonilla Rodriguez, Nicholas Odeh, Rodolfo Brevé Martinez and Ferrari were the station’s staff announcers. Bonilla Rodriguez was the first to broadcast a soccer game in 1935 between a Costa Rican team and Club Motagua, a renowned Honduran team. Assisting Bonilla as engineer was Nat Lopez Fuentes, from a family radio dynasty known nationwide.\n\nThere were only a handful of radio receivers and in order to reach a wide audience Ferrari installed loudspeakers at various locations in Tegucigalpa. This was a daily pastime, an occasion for locals to meet and enjoy the programming. At first the programming was limited to news, government bulletins and recorded music. However, during the 1940s the station acquired a more powerful transmitter, reaching audiences in faraway countries with its shortwave signal. \n\nHRN was important during War World II, since it rebroadcast information from the BBC in London and NBC in the United States. Ferrari continued his support of local talent with broadcasts including pianists, marimba bands, orchestras, singers, poets, composers, comedians and amateur artists. After the war, Europe, Asia and North America began to rebuild their economies and Honduras enjoyed some prosperity and tranquility under the Carias Andino regime. \n\nHRN became one of many private enterprises which enjoyed a modest increase in business. During this time, the station replaced \"La Voz del Comercio\" for its current slogan, \"La Voz de Honduras\". Ferrari expanded the station, providing opportunity to a new generation of promising talent; some became household names, solidifying HRN's position as a powerhouse of Central American radio.\n\n{The writer; Roque Morán Hernandez, was the youngest announcer during the late 50’s}.\n\n1948 marked the birth of Radio America. At that time Tegucigalpa (the capital) comprised two cities, divided by the Rio Choluteca. It was a small metropolis, both geographically and in population. Radio America broadcast with three kW of power; small by later standards, but sufficient for experimentation. Soon it increased its power to 10 kW, easily reaching audiences in the twin cities of Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela. \n\nThe station was first owned by Sergio Castellón who, within a few years, sold it to Cuban entrepreneur Rafael Silvio Peña. Peña, bringing the Cuban concept of radio as a fresh approach, began with live performances (especially \"radio-novelas\", or soap-operas). Peña brought in Emilio Díaz; the two developed programs popular in Cuba such as \"La Tremenda Corte\", which was known throughout Latin America. Subsequently Dr. Andonie Fernandez bought the station, maintaining its tradition while ushering in a new era.\n\nSeveral changes took place, the most important of which was the addition of well-known radio personalities and the highest-rated program (\"“Platicando con mi Barbero”\", after the cast left HRN). This program featured a group headed by humorist Herman Allan Padgett, considered a genius for his comic range and originality. Padgett had gathered the best-known talent of the time, including Julio Lopez Fuentes, Abelardo Enrique Avendaño and Ricardo Antonio Redondo Licona. Like HRN, Radio America strives to improve; Fernandez created a conglomerate within the communications industry in Central America.\n\n\n\n"}

Sarmal (including Sadmal or Surmal) who are predominantly Pahari Rajputs are popularly known as Pahari Raje and are thought/believed to belong to Suryavanshi Lineage of Hindu Kshatriya Class. These Pahari Rajputs as lived in the lower hills of Dugar Desh (also known as the Dogra Rajputs). In Rajatarngini, there is mention of Thakkuras, the chiefs of the hills who acknowledged their suzerainty to strong Kashmir rulers. They are being addressed as the Lords of the country by Kalhana. Sarmals are believed to be the offshoot of these Feudal Lords so referred to as Thakkuras.\n\nMohd. Habib regards them as the actual fighters in India, much like the knights of Europe. In his words, \"the thakur could face death, that was easy for him, but he could not risk captivity\". They were so proficient in fighting that their spirit could be successfully maintained by them until old age. They provided the sure quota of soldiers required during the wars and monarch set up of Kashmir. They were lovers of horses, archery and swords.\n\nIn Kalhana Rajatarngini, these Hill-Rajas or Thakurs, are presented as playing a significant role in Kashmiri politics from the 11th century onward.\nThe Hill-Rajas allied their houses with the royal house of Kashmir through marriage. The kings of Kashmir played a correspondingly powerful role in the local politics of the Hill-Rajas. The goodwill or obedience of the Hill-Rajas must always have been a desideratum for the kings of Kashmir, in order to regulate contact between themselves and the powers of the north Indian plains.\n\nSarmals belongs to Survayansha Dynasty. It is the dynasty in which Incarnation of Lord Ram took place.\n\n\nSun dynasty is oldest among the kshatriyas.\n\nThe societies in the Himalayan region, from Jammu to Himachal Pradesh and from Himachal to Uttrakhand have a similar pattern of history, where numerous small kingdoms were scattered over hills and small valleys.\nTo term it more precisely, these kingdoms was rather fortified villages of warrior—landlords known as Thakurs and Ranas. \n\nThese Feudal Lords were Rajputs by lineage. Most of the Rajput groups in this region originated from these kingdoms, the name of which became the name of their clan.Actually, similar for Sarmal Clan which have its origin in Sauram hills of Dugar region of Samba District of Jammu & Kashmir. The family of Rajputs of Sauram Region then began to know as Sarmal who were Suryavanshi Kshatriya.\n\nA majority of them are concentrated in the Samba District of the Indian-administered Jammu & Kashmir. Moreover, they are also scattered in Jammu, Kathua, Doda, Katra, Bhadrawah and neighbouring states like Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.\n\n"}

There are 105 television broadcasters in Peru, 22 of which are in Lima. In regard to television receivers, in 2003 there were 5,470,000 — that is 200 televisions for every thousand inhabitants. The number of cable subscribers was 967,943 in 2011.\n\nThe first experimental tramnsmission of television in Peru occurred on September 21, 1939, transmitting a film and an artistic program from Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe school in Lima. Another test transmission was made by Antonio Pereyra from the Bolivar Hotel on May 28, 1954. On January 17, 1958, the Ministry of Education and UNESCO inaugurated the State Channel 7 and conducted a test broadcast. The first commercial television broadcast was on Channel 4 Radio América in Lima, on December 15, 1958 by Nicanor González and José Antonio Umbert. Channel 4 Radio America's creation was possible because of an agreement with NBC and RCA.\n\nSeveral commercial television stations followed, including Channel 2 (Radiodifusora Victoria S.A.), Channel 13 — later changed to Channel 5 (Panamericana Televisión S.A.), Channel 9 (Compañía Peruana de Producciones Radiales y TV), Channel 11 (Bego Televisión S.A.). Many of them soon acquired — or were associated with — stations outside Metropolitan Lima. In just two months, November and December 1959, Lima stores recorded sales of 10,000 television sets, and full page ads in newspapers and magazines announced the start of the era of television in Peru. By April 1960, there were 55,000 television sets operating in the Peruvian capital.

{"id": "35887731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35887731", "title": "The Longest Daycare", "text": "The Longest Daycare\n\nMaggie Simpson in \"The Longest Daycare\", or simply The Longest Daycare, is a 2012 American traditionally animated 3D comedy short film based on the animated television series \"The Simpsons\". In the film, Maggie Simpson is enrolled at a new daycare facility where she squares off with the foul-tempered Baby Gerald when she befriends a caterpillar. The short originated with \"Simpsons\" producer James L. Brooks, who enlisted long-time veteran of the series, David Silverman, to direct the film. The picture was written by producers Brooks, Al Jean, David Mirkin, writers Michael Price and Joel H. Cohen, as well as show creator Matt Groening. The events of the short film take place between the twenty-third and twenty-fourth seasons of \"The Simpsons\".\n\nThe film premiered on July 13, 2012, where it was attached to screenings of the 20th Century Fox release \"\". The film is the second \"Simpsons\" theatrical release. The short was re-released on February 15, 2013 and played before the film \"Life of Pi\" in selected theaters in USA. Reception has been positive, praising the storytelling and animation. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2013, losing to \"Paperman\".\n\nMarge Simpson drops off Maggie at the Ayn Rand School for Tots, where, after going through a security screening, she is classified as being of \"average intelligence\", by a machine manufactured by \"Often-Wrong Technologies\". A guard then carries her past the \"Room for Gifted Babies\" and puts her in the \"Nothing Special\" dreary corner. The playtime items are either taken away or eaten by the other babies. A butterfly then makes its way into the room as Maggie's nemesis, Baby Gerald, squashes and kills it on the wall with a mallet and draws a box around it with a crayon. A second butterfly also meets the same fate. Maggie finds a caterpillar and a pop-up book about the life cycle of the butterfly. Realizing that the caterpillar could also meet the fate of the first two butterflies, she tries to protect it from Gerald. The caterpillar later encases itself in a chrysalis and starts to transform. Once the newly formed butterfly emerges, Maggie tries to help it fly out of the window, but Gerald seemingly kills it by shutting the blinds on it as it attempts to pass through. Maggie dramatically mourns as she falls to the floor. Marge then arrives to pick her up, when it is revealed Maggie's scene was only a ruse to cover the truth: she had slipped her hair bow onto the windowsill and wore the butterfly on her forehead in its place. She then sets the butterfly free as Marge drives her home.\n\nThe origins of \"The Longest Daycare\" came about when \"The Simpsons\" executive producer James L. Brooks proposed the idea of making a short film and releasing it in cinemas in front of a feature film—similar to how animation film studio Pixar creates shorts to play before their feature films. He wanted the short to be a fun gift for the fans of \"The Simpsons\", and according to the series' showrunner Al Jean, \"We [the staff] just wanted to do this as a way of saying, 'We appreciate how much people have stayed with the show and watched it for 25 years.'\" Brooks picked David Silverman, long-time veteran of the series and director of \"The Simpsons Movie\" (2007) to oversee the film. Silverman gave credit to Richard Sakai for the idea to produce the film in stereoscopic 3-D. He considered the reasoning for employing 3-D \"hard to describe,\" noting that was largely an experiment and its genesis was born out of \"having fun.\"\n\nThe group first gathered in March 2011—consisting of Brooks, Silverman, Al Jean, David Mirkin, writers Joel Cohen and Michael Price, and \"Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening via phone—to pitch ideas for a short. Early on, it was decided to keep it entirely silent and employ Maggie as the lead character, and the setting of a daycare was decided upon. Jean wrote the treatment for the film, and Silverman completed an animatic of early story reels in June 2011. By the following February, the team regrouped to structure the story and formulate more ideas. With the help of Brad Ableson, Erick Tran and Ben Lane, the storyboards and animatic for the short were approved and the film entered production. Silverman himself animated two shots present in the final film.\n\nSilverman and his crew began animation work on the short in March 2012, completing in May after just under ten weeks of production. He considered his crew \"very experienced\", noting that he worked with stereographer Eric Kurland for the 3-D shots. It was animated with \"The Simpsons\" usual production pipeline, which involved sending shots to AKOM in South Korea, but with an amplified focus on the 3-D. The team would attempt to complete ten scenes to send to AKOM per week, which would be returned in a cleaned-up form after two weeks. Shots were then composited together at Film Roman out of necessity as the backgrounds relied on the 3-D. Most stereo elements for 3-D were picked out after shots were cleaned up, while others were manipulated in post-production with After Effects. The short was more costly than the average episode of the television show.\n\n\"The Longest Daycare\" was first announced to the public in a title card at the end of the series' twenty-third-season finale \"Lisa Goes Gaga\" that aired on May 20, 2012. It was revealed that the short would be shown in theaters in the United States prior to screenings of the film \"\", starting on July 13, 2012. Like \"The Simpsons\", \"Ice Age: Continental Drift\" was produced by 20th Century Fox. A teaser trailer for \"The Longest Daycare\", lasting approximately five seconds, was released on July 3, 2012. This was the second time that characters from \"The Simpsons\" appeared on the big screen, as \"The Simpsons Movie\" was released in 2007. Coincidentally, the trailer for that film was first attached to screenings of the \"Continental Drift\" predecessor \"\".\n\nA 2D version of the short was displayed by the producers of \"The Simpsons\" at the series' panel at San Diego Comic-Con International on July 14, 2012.\n\nIt had its world television premiere on Network Ten in Australia on February 17, 2013 at 6.25pm, 5 hours before it premieres on Fox in the USA but 16 hours later in real time due to time zone differences, right after \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Hardly Kirk-ing\". It was also aired in the UK on the same day on Sky 1 at 9.55am, 12 noon and 7.30pm and on Channel 4 at 1.30pm GMT. It also premiered on the same day, at 7.55pm on Prima COOL, in the Czech Republic and on FOX Brasil at 8.30pm.\n\nAfter being nominated for an Academy Award, \"The Longest Daycare\" was released along with all the other 15 Oscar-nominated short films in theaters by ShortsHD.\n\n\"The Longest Daycare\" has received critical acclaim. Many film critics have said that the short was better than \"Ice Age: Continental Drift\". Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" argued that \"the brief tale is far more clever and whimsical than any sequence in \"Ice Age\".\" Similarly, \"Sun Herald\" critic Leigh Paatsch said the short \"displays all the wit and creativity missing from \"Continental Drift\".\" \"San Francisco Chronicle\" writer Amy Biancolli commented that the short is \"only a few minutes long, but those few minutes boast more imagination, pathos and suspense than the entire film that follows.\" Joe Williams of the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" wrote that while the short takes place in a daycare, it ironically features more \"artistic maturity\" than \"Continental Drift\".\n\n\"The Longest Daycare\" has been praised for being both humorous and emotional. Puig and Biancolli described the short as \"hilarious\". Bill Goodykoontz of \"The Arizona Republic\" stated that the film is \"terrific—sweet, sad, funny, surprising,\" and Kristian Lin of \"Fort Worth Weekly\" said it is \"clever\" and \"surprisingly moving\". Writing for \"Pioneer Press\", Chris Hewitt noted that Maggie's interaction with Gerald \"is hilarious and, ultimately, poignant in an animated film that covers more territory, all without dialogue, than most full-length movies.\" He went on to call the short a \"triumph of storytelling, pacing and big-hearted humor.\"\n\nA. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" called the short a \"charming 3-D cartoon\" that is \"witty and touching and marvelously concise\".<ref name=\"Scott-12/07\"></ref> He added that it \"cleverly blends the bright-colored flatness of the television show with the gimmickry of 3-D. It also upholds (more than the TV series itself) one of the golden rules of animation: no talking.\" Tim Martain of \"The Mercury\" has also described the short as \"touching\". \"The Boston Globe\"s Tom Russo thought the short was \"a welcome throwback to the days when \"The Simpsons\" had more sentiment at its core, and wasn’t so much about the latest batch of newbie Ivy League writers taking their cues from \"Family Guy\".\" In a joint review of the episode \"Hardly Kirk-ing\", Teresa Lopez of TV fanatic said \"\"The Longest Daycare\" was a beautiful piece of animation showcasing a tender story of hope in an otherwise bleak environment. I feel like the only time \"The Simpsons\" can really exercise some creativity and depth is in these shorts and during the show's opening sequence.\"\n\n"}

Major Edward Bowes, the originator of the program and its master of ceremonies, left the show in 1945 and died the following year. He was ultimately succeeded by Ted Mack, when the show was brought into television in 1948.\n\nThe show is a progenitor of later, similar programs such as \"Star Search\", \"American Idol\" and \"America's Got Talent\".\n\nThe format was almost always the same. At the beginning of the show, the talent's order of appearance was determined by spinning a wheel. After it was announced how many episodes the current one marked (the final broadcast on CBS being the 1,651st), the wheel was spun. As the wheel spun, the words \"Round and round she goes, and where she stops nobody knows\" were always intoned. (From the late 1950s forward, the wheel was gone: it was symbolized by flute arpeggios as Ted Mack invoked the traditional phrase.)\n\nVarious acts, sometimes singers or other musicians, quite often vaudeville fare such as jugglers, tap dancers, baton twirlers, and the like, would perform, with the audience being asked to vote for their favorites by postcard or telephone. The telephone number JUdson 6-7000 was on a banner at the bottom of the screen for viewers to call.\n\nAs the show gained markets outside New York, Mack would give the address (\"Box 191 Radio City Station\") where viewers could send their postcards; he did this after every act. The winners were invited to appear on the next week's show. Three-time winners were eligible for the annual championship, with the grand-prize winner receiving a $2000 scholarship.\n\nTed Mack ensured that the show was very fast-paced. Despite the program's title, it was generally only a half-hour show, the only exception to this rule being from March 1956 to June 1957 on ABC, when it was expanded to an hour.\n\nSome contestants became minor celebrities at the time, but few ever became really big show-business stars. The two greatest successes of the show's television era were Gladys Knight, then only a child, and Pat Boone. Boone's appearances on the show probably caused the closest thing that it ever had to a scandal. After he had appeared, and won, for several weeks, it was revealed that he had appeared on the rival CBS Television show \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\", meaning that he was technically not an \"amateur\" singer. He was removed from the program, but by then his fame was assured. At twenty-three, Boone was hosting his own variety show on ABC, \"The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom\", which aired from 1957–1960.\n\nOther future celebrities discovered on the show include Ann-Margret (in 1958), Jose Feliciano (in 1962), Irene Cara (in 1967) and Tanya Tucker (in 1969). Louis Farrakhan appeared in 1949 playing a violin, under his real name Louis Wolcott. Future child actor Roger Mobley appeared with an older brother and older sister in a musical trio. The greatest fame attained by anyone appearing on the show was that achieved by Frank Sinatra, who appeared on the show during its radio days with \"The Hoboken Four\".\n\nDuring World War II, some in the American armed forces believed that someone involved with the program was a Nazi sympathizer because after many episodes aired, an American naval vessel would supposedly be sunk. The claim was that coded information was passed out in the course of the broadcast. Some accused Bowes himself, but none of these accusations could ever be proved. Bowes was one of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's closest friends and was personally responsible for having the swimming pool constructed at the White House when FDR was in office. As the years went by, the audience for this program aged as well. The Sunday -afternoon version of the series, which aired on CBS in the 1960s, was invariably sponsored by Geritol and other patent medicines manufactured by their long-time sponsor, the J. B. Williams Company.\n\nBowes started the radio show on WHN in New York City in 1934. Bowes' field assistant was Ted Mack, who scouted and auditioned talent for the program. Mack brought the show back in 1948 on ABC Radio, where it ran until 1952. When Mack assumed the host duties, his position in the field was taken by Albert Fisher.\n\nThe official archives of \"The Original Amateur Hour\" and the rights to the original programs and related material are now owned by Fisher. Fisher has donated the radio recordings and television films and tapes to the Library of Congress, and has compiled a DVD collection of highlights from the series.\n\nThe television debut came on January 18, 1948 on the DuMont Television Network with Mack as the host. The regular staff for the television show included Lou Goldberg (aka Lewis Graham); Lloyd Marx, musical director; accompanist Dotty Marx, his wife; Jack Hoins, writer/producer; and Marguerite (Dwyer) Scheid, talent scout. The show regularly traveled to other cities across the United States and made at least two trips to Europe for the USO. In the early 1950s, the show went to Washington, D.C., for a memorable benefit featuring contestants from Congress and the Truman administration.\n\nThe series is one of only six shows—the others were \"The Arthur Murray Party\"; \"Down You Go\"; \"The Ernie Kovacs Show\"; \"Pantomime Quiz\"; and \"Tom Corbett, Space Cadet\"—to appear on all four TV networks during the Golden Age of Television. The series was broadcast weekly, on early Sunday evenings, on DuMont until September 25, 1949, then moved to NBC Television in October 1949 where it remained until September 1952. NBC then hosted it from April 1953 to September 1954.\n\n\"The Original Amateur Hour\" finished at #27 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1950–1951 season.\n\nThe show moved to ABC (October 1955 to June 1957), then returned to NBC (July 1957 to October 1958). It then ran from May 1959 to October 1959 on CBS, before returning to ABC for a last prime-time run from March 1960 to September 26, 1960. Even then the show wasn't finished—it ran for another decade as a late-Sunday-afternoon feature on CBS, beginning on October 2, 1960.\n\nMany long-running CBS shows were canceled in 1970–71 because they attracted viewers of an advanced age. However, Ted Mack beat CBS to the punch and terminated the \"Original Amateur Hour\" of his own volition. The final show was broadcast on September 27, 1970.\n\nIn 1992 Albert Fisher revived the program (as \"The New Original Amateur Hour\") on cable television's Family Channel (now ABC) hosted by weatherman Willard Scott. This revival lasted one season, in spite of its popularity and high ratings. This show started television talent competitions & is the reason for shows today like America’s Got Talent and American Idol.\n\nIt featured the debut of highly successful and famous Backstreet Boy Nick Carter. This was a catalyst for other child stars including Elizabeth Byler who starred In October Sky, Earnest Goes to Camp, Other Voices Other Rooms and Summer Pulley who went on to become a member of the Disney Channels Mickey Mouse Club, a cast member of Nickelodeon’s Clarissa Explains It All and star in the movie Parenthood with Steve Martin. The show also revived the practice of counting the number of the original episodes, with the first being show number 1,652 and the last, show number 1,664.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57312557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57312557", "title": "The Spell (1977 film)", "text": "The Spell (1977 film)\n\nThe Spell is a 1977 American made-for-television horror/drama film which premiered on NBC as \"The Big Event\" Movie of the Week. It is directed by Lee Philips and stars Lee Grant, Susan Myers, Lelia Goldoni and Helen Hunt. It touches on the subject of telekinesis and follows the story of an adolescent girl who seeks revenge on those who ridicule her, while her mother tries to bring an end to her evil acts. It has gained a reputation as being an imitation of the 1976 classic Brian De Palma film \"Carrie\" as several similarities are present, while it has fallen somewhat under the radar over the years and is seen as a \"forgotten film\".\n\nRita Matchett is a shy 15-year-old girl often picked upon for being overweight. One day in particular in her high school gym, Rita is teased by her classmates, in which she attempts to defend herself. While the girls take turns at rope climbing, Rita, struggling to climb, is opposite Jackie Segall, one of her snooty classmates. Jackie climbs to the top and begins to show off in front of the other girls by doing spins. Rita's stare becomes fixated on Jackie which causes her to fall of the rope and break her neck, killing her in the process.\n\nRita comes from a wealthy family and her home life is unhappy. She is neither close with her father, Glenn, nor her younger sister, Kristina, who view her as fat and unattractive, and often criticize her for her looks. Her mother, Marilyn, tries to maintain a balance in the home and is constantly upset by how Rita is treated and the rivalry between her daughters. Marilyn becomes furious with Rita when her attitude begins to change. However, she grows more concerned when Rita shows signs of abnormal behavior and starts speaking in chant, following an argument.\n\nIt later becomes evident that Rita is dabbling in something dangerous as a number of \"accidents\" seem to occur; Glenn is almost injured in a hit-and-run incident but is unharmed, while Marilyn's friend, Kathleen, having been ill for sometime, suddenly dies due to spontaneous combustion and Kristina almost drowns in a swimming pool. Marilyn is initially not convinced that Rita is behind these attacks, but Kristina confirms her suspicions when she reveals to Marilyn that Rita has been visiting Jo Standish, the school gym teacher, and they chant together. Rita had threatened Kristina to keep quiet about it.\n\nGlenn informs Rita that he will be leaving home to attend a private school London, much to her disapproval, resulting in her to act aggressively. Marilyn sends Glenn and Kristina away for the night so that she can spend time with Rita. That evening, Marilyn follows Rita to Jo's house where she watches in secret as the two discuss the recent events and discovers that Jo caused the accidents so that Rita could seek revenge. When Jo tells Rita that their power will extent to a new community, Rita becomes upset as she believes that she will no longer be different and unique if others were to be like her. In the disagreement, the two begin to chant, and with her new powerful strength, Rita forces Jo to the ground. Back at home, Marilyn confronts Rita and begins to chant which violently forces Rita to be thrown around the room, while Marilyn tells her that it is over and if Rita insists on hurting her father and sister that she will destroy her. It is revealed that Marilyn also has power as Rita tries to retaliate and the two begin to constantly chant until Marilyn overpowers Rita, bring it all to an end. Marilyn comforts a sobbing Rita telling her that it is all over.\n\n\n\"The Spell\" went into production stages in the mid 1970s, when writer Brian Taggert developed the script and pitched it to Columbia Pictures, where he intended the film to receive a theatrical release. Columbia was impressed with Taggert's writing and his take on the theme of telekinesis. However, the film was slow to get off the ground and during the pre-production process, Brian De Palma's similarly themed \"Carrie\" became acclaimed and widely successful, which resulted in the film being converted into a teleplay for a network television Movie of the Week. Taggert claimed that he completed his script for the film while Stephen King was writing \"Carrie\". Both films open with a similar scene in which the character, Rita, in \"The Spell\", is teased and picked on by her classmates, which is how \"Carrie\" opened. As \"The Spell\" premiered on NBC three months following the release of \"Carrie\", it was seen as an imitation.\n\n\"The Spell\" was broadcast on NBC on February 20, 1977 at 8:00 pm.\n\nThe film has received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nIn an early review from Harriet Van Horne from New York Magazine, she said that \"you will shudder at \"The Spell\", giggle in the wrong places, and, NBC hopes, and stay tuned in to learn all about telekinesis.\" Of actress Lee Grant, she stated, \"Grant is too fine an actress for this sort of TV trash\".\n\nIn an online review for The Terror Trap, it was said of the film that \"overall, a little slow at times but not bad\". When reviewed for The Horror Honeys website, it was stated of the film that \"It's not the perfect revenge film, but it \"is\" an interesting snapshot of the era and there are far worse ways to kill an evening\". Chris Hartley of The Video Graveyard mentions that \"\"The Spell\" is pretty forgettable stuff. When taken for what it is, it's not a complete waste of time and does have some unintentional chuckles and solid performances propping it up, but it's also just another forgotten 70s TV flick.\"\n\nThe film has been reviewed in several blog posts; in a 2009 blog post for Final Girl, Stacie Ponder said that \"This is a made-for-TV effort that's fairly tame even for its time period\" and \"It's little more than a pleasant 70-minute diversion\". Jeffery Berg of the jdbrecords commented that \"it's pretty preposterous, kind of boring, and sometimes hilarious.\" When it film was reviewed in a blog post for Horror Movie a Day, it was said that \"even as a TV Movie this thing is shockingly dull throughout.\"\n\nIn the United States, \"The Spell\" received a VHS release courtesy of Worldvision Home Entertainment Inc. in 1984 following its television broadcast, which was rare considering that television films of the time were not picked up for home video distribution. The film received a second VHS release in the U.S. from GoodTimes Entertainment. It has been released on VHS in several European countries including Finland and Spain. It has never been made available on DVD format.\n\nIt was released on Blu-ray format in North America on September 5, 2017 via Scream Factory, a subsidiary of Shout! Factory, under license from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment and MGM Home Entertainment. The set contains the film's original broadcast ratio of 1.33:1, DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 and English Subtitles, while special features consist of a new commentary by made-for-TV historian and author Amanda Reyes and a new interview with screenwriter Brian Taggert.\n\n\"The Spell\" is currently unavailable to view from all major streaming services. On February 22, 2010, \"The Spell\" was included for streaming on Netflix, and was removed from the service on July 21, 2015. It has additionally been accessible to view on Hulu, but is no longer available, nor is it available to watch via Amazon Video.\n\nWith the telekinesis theme becoming increasingly popular following the release of Brian De Palma's \"Carrie\", an adaptation of Stephen King's 1974 novel, many films attempted to recreate this theme, with little success; \"The Spell\" was the first to do so and although claimed that the script with written prior to King's novel, many similarities appear in \"The Spell\" including the opening scene in which the character, Rita, is bullied by her classmates, family issues, and telekinetic revenge. In the final scene in the film, which concerns the showdown between Rita and her mother, Marilyn, Rita uses her power to hurl knives at Marilyn; although missing her aim, it is much like the ending to \"Carrie\" in which Carrie kills her mother by launching flying knives through the air. Many films which have been considered imitations followed this, some of which include, \"Jennifer\" (1978), \"Patrick\" (1978), \"Evilspeak\" (1982), and to a lesser extent, \"Laserblast\" (1978). Other films with a similar theme include \"The Fury\" (1978) and \"Firestarter\" (1984).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2262245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2262245", "title": "The Warriors (video game)", "text": "The Warriors (video game)\n\nThe Warriors is a beat 'em up video game, developed by Rockstar Toronto and published by Rockstar Games. It was released on October 17, 2005 for PlayStation 2, Xbox and was later released for PlayStation Portable. \n\"The Warriors\" is based on the 1979 movie of the same name (which in turn, is based on the 1965 novel of the same name), and features large scale brawling in 3D environments interspersed with other activities such as chase sequences.\n\nThe console versions of the game were developed at Rockstar Toronto, while the PSP port was developed by Rockstar Leeds. The game was first released on PS2 and Xbox on October 17, 2005 in the United States and October 21, 2005 in Europe. The original Xbox version featured 720p resolution; marking the first Rockstar game with HD graphics for home consoles. The game was then released on the PlayStation 3 on May 28, 2013 in the United States and May 29, 2013 in Europe via the PlayStation Network. The game was released on the PlayStation 4 on July 5, 2016 in the United States and Europe via the PlayStation Network. However, due to licensing restrictions, as of 2016 several songs on the soundtrack have been removed from both the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 versions of The Warriors, including Fear's \"I Love Livin' in the City, and Joe Walsh's \"In the City\" from the original film's soundtrack.\n\nThe game takes place in gritty 1970s New York City. The story follows a street gang known as the Warriors, who have been accused of a murder they didn't commit, and must return to their home turf in one night, although the game begins three months prior to the film's events. The actors from the film itself reprised their roles to perform the voices of their original characters. Upon its release, \"The Warriors\" received a positive critical response.\n\n\"The Warriors\" is an action-adventure, survival game which focuses heavily on brawling. Like most games from Rockstar Games, several minor gameplay elements are mixed into the experience, such as the ability to use spray paint to mark turf or to insult other people. The playable characters are the Warriors leader Cleon, Cleon's lieutenant Swan, heavy muscles Ajax and Snow, Cleon and Swan's friends Vermin and Cowboy, the scout Fox, Harlem native Cochise, and Rembrandt, the Warriors graffiti artist. Cleon, Swan, Ajax, and Rembrandt are the most heavily featured characters. An arcade game called \"Armies of the Night\" is unlocked after you complete the main storyline of the game. The playable characters are Swan and Ajax.\n\nIn this prequel segment, The Warriors' headquarters serves as a hub. From inside, you can train (10 ranks of physical fitness such as, sit-ups, press ups, chin ups, and heavy bag, that increase your stamina), talk to fellow gang members, play through rumble mode and other bonus material, walk outside to Coney Island for extra missions, or begin the next level of the story proper. The player is presented with mission objectives such as beating up a certain number of enemy gang members or stealing a certain amount of items, with more complex and creative tasks like winning a graffiti competition in SoHo, stealing goods to plant on crooked cops and rival gang members, and wild chases away from baseball bat wielding members of the Baseball Furies. Fighting takes the form of gang rumble style action with the player being assisted by other Warriors at the same time (a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 8). Combos are performed with 2-3 button chains for weak attacks, strong attacks, holds and throws. Grab attacks can be used for the playable character to perform their own unique power attack that will quickly decrease the enemy's health. The game sees the Warriors fight their way through the ranks, building a heavy rep and getting their colors out in force, until they get an invite to a meeting of all of the gangs of New York City, which is where the movie (and the last few missions of the game) begins.\n\nThe game progresses linearly from one mission event to the next, usually presented as a cutscene. Combat in \"The Warriors\" occurs in real time and involves pressing buttons to initiate attacks by the on-screen character. By pausing the game, the player can find combat techniques ― 2-3 combos, wall smash, grab and throws, charges, body cross attack, snap attacks, weapon attacks, and counter-attacks. The player can also look at the character's stats. This menu is manipulated by using the right analog stick, while movement is controlled in the 3D environment using the joystick, and camera controls are managed using the up arrow on the digital pad and the analog joystick, allowing the player to navigate the menu while avoiding or approaching enemies. In addition, players can choose to mug people, receiving money, flash, and spray. Each level contains items the player can collect or steal, such as car radios and jewelry. Completing these actions earn the player points, which count towards unlocking soldiers, arenas and game modes for Rumble Mode, the game's free-for-all multiplayer mode.\n\nThe playable character has a bar below their feet to determine their health level, reducing whenever the character takes damage, although it can be replenished by using flash. The circular grey bar inside the health bar represents the player's grappling stamina, draining upon grabbing or mounting an opponent. The top-left hand side represents the character rage meter, which, when filled, allows the player to pull off a variety of combos and styles. In rage, the player will become temporarily invincible, using finishing moves and inflicting serious damage on the opponent. The player's allies, if they are knocked out, the player can use flash to replenish their health. However, if the playable character loses all of their health, the mission ends and the player will be prompted to resume from the checkpoint or restart the mission from the beginning. Defeating enemies will cause items to fall from their bodies; flash to restore health; spray to spray over enemy gang territories; and money which can be used to purchase items from dealers.\n\nThe player can choose to help other people in Coney Island. In return for helping these people, the Warriors will learn new abilities, such as defeating policemen to receive cuffs to subdue and arrest anybody, cuff-keys that will allow the player to free Warriors with keys instead of breaking cuffs, escape from cuffs themselves with cuff-keys, increase flash capacity, and earn brass knuckles and steel-toed boots to inflict more damage to the enemy. The player can also choose to have the Warriors exercise in the headquarters to increase stamina.\n\nDuring \"The Warriors\", there are a collection of levels, referred to as missions, which the player must progress through. Eighteen can be accessed, along with six more bonus missions, known as \"Flashbacks\", which show how the Warriors were formed, and how each member of the Warriors came to join the gang, and to unlock an arcade machine that will allow you to play \"Armies of the Night\". The setting in the game for the Warriors is their home territory, Coney Island. However, throughout the game, the player travels to other areas of New York City visiting other gangs' territories in the process. Completing the missions/game allows the player to replay levels, to improve on the player's score, and unlock new characters, and a game mode called Fury Mode where you play as the Baseball Furies.\n\nThe design and casting of the characters was very faithful to what was seen in \"The Warriors\". Each character is still portrayed as their respective role from the film ― Cyrus, the Riffs leader, inhabits Van Cortlandt Park, where the meeting took place. Luther, the Rogues leader, is based out of his hearse, The Baseball Furies' territory is Riverside Park, The Lizzies' their apartment, with other smaller gangs based around the city. When starting a mission, the Warriors will occasionally stay at their home turf or travel to another place via train to use as a starting point.\n\nMissions and events normally begin at the Coney Island headquarters, which is also used as a launching point throughout the game (except after the meeting), and the player can also travel to places all across New York City, including Tremont where the Warriors encounters the Orphans, a low-class gang, and also Riverside Park which is run by the Baseball Furies, a well-respected gang. The main players travel from one turf to another all across New York, to let the public radio station know there is a new gang in town. This sometimes results in the Warriors brawling with the rival gangs. The Warriors' hangout features a machine resembling a pinball table, the \"Rumble Mode\" which upon completion of missions, unlocks special stages where the player can fight all of the gangs in New York City.\n\nThe primary protagonist is Cleon, the Warriors leader in the first half of the game until after the meeting. Cleon's role was to increase the Warriors reputation and rid Coney Island of the Destroyers. The major protagonist is Swan, the second-in-command throughout most of the game, covering the film itself. Swan's role was to bring the Warriors back to Coney Island from the meeting where they were set up as the murderers of Cyrus. The other Warriors feature an important role with each Warrior having a role, like the heavy muscle Ajax and Snow, Vermin is the bread man, which means he is the one who carries the money, Cowboy keeps track of The Warriors inventory, although this is only mentioned in the film. Fox is the scout who goes ahead of The Warriors, warning them if trouble is ahead, Harlem native Cochise is the watchman who watches their back when walking in a group, Snow is the radio man, which is also only established in the film. and Rembrandt is The Warriors' graffiti artist.\n\nMercy serves as Swan's love interest in the second half of \"The Warriors\". The primary antagonist is Luther, the Rogues leader, responsible for Cyrus' murder and framing the Warriors for the crime. During battles and encounters with enemies, other Warrior members will assist the player in various situations.\n\nOther areas contain other gangs of New York City, which the player must defeat in a battle. On one occasion, gang members tend to be scouts that appear in orange dots on the radar in different areas and spaces. Upon being spotted by the gang member, the scout will call for backup, and the orange circles up the radar ― the player can then choose either to attack or stealth kill the scout. Policemen will appear as blue dots on the radar; if the player commits a crime, the blue circles up the radar, the blue dots will flash and the crime that is committed will appear on the middle screen, prompting the officers to chase and attempt to handcuff the player― the player can also assault the officers or sneak into a hide area if no-one can see the player at the time. Civilians in local places will rat the player out to a gang member or the police when committing a crime that disturbs their inhabitants.\n\nThroughout the Warriors endeavours, they will be aided by Flash, Spray, and Knife dealers, to help them out ― Flash dealers are there to supply the player with flash, the game's equivalent of health packs, which costs 20 dollars, Spray dealers supply the player with spray paint, which costs 5 dollars, while Knife Dealers supply the player with knives, which cost 50 dollars. However, some of the dealers tend to defraud the player and make a run for it, but the player can chase them down to recover their money. However, if the player chooses to attack the dealers, they will either retaliate or run, though they will respawn. In \"Rumble Mode\", playable characters can also be other gangs that have been unlocked in the game, to compete against other gangs in a match of one's choosing.\n\nIn the story mode of the game, there are a total of 18 missions. Missions 1-13 take place three months before the meeting and missions 14-18 cover the movie itself. The player can only control one specific character in each mission, while the others are computer-controlled. The main Warriors that are controlled by the player are Cleon, Swan, Rembrandt, Ajax, Cowboy and Cochise. The only Warrior to not have a full playable mission to themselves is Snow; the only time players assume control of him is in the second half of mission 6 Writers Block, also Fox doesn't have a mission where he leads a War party. Along with the main missions, there are 5 bonus missions called \"Flashbacks\", which tell how the Warriors started and how each member joined. During each mission, the Warriors will meet and face off with other gangs in New York. In most missions, they will take the subway train to the other gang's turf. Although they are featured and mentioned in the game, the Electric Eliminators, the Panzers and the Van Cortlandt Rangers are the only gangs that the Warriors do not meet. The Destroyers are the only gang that are not featured in the film. Completing each mission unlocks gangs, arenas and mini-games.\n\nDuring each mission, there are 6 commands that the Warchief can issue out to his fellow Warriors.\n\n\nThe game follows the plot of the film \"The Warriors\", focusing on a Coney Island street gang the Warriors. Led by Cleon ninety-days prior, the Warriors dispose their long time rival gang the Destroyers after Virgil, the Destroyers leader and former friend of Cleon is defeated. Their reputation increases by humiliating a low-rank gang the Orphans, killing Chatterbox leader of the Hi-Hats, spraying on trains, allying with the Saracens and set up their rivals the Jones Street Boys, and corrupt NYPD officers. Meanwhile, Cyrus, leader of the Gramercy Riffs, the most powerful gang in New York City plans a meeting to unite the gangs as one.\n\nOn the night of the meeting in Van Cortlandt Park, Cyrus proposes to the assembled crowd a permanent citywide truce that would allow the gangs to control the city. Everyone opens to Cyrus' idea, only the leader is fatally shot by the Rogues leader, Luther―in the dramatic chaos, the killer frames Cleon and the Warriors. The Riffs hold the Warriors responsible and beat down Cleon, leaving his fate ambiguous while the other Warriors escape. Swan, the Warriors \"warchief\" takes charge of the group and make their way home. Cyrus's death sends anger through the city and the Riffs call a hit on the Warriors on a radio DJ, while the gang themselves remain unaware they are implicated in Cyrus' murder.\n\nAfter the Turnbull AC's failure to kill the Warriors as they escape to board the train en route to Coney Island, the train is stopped by a fire on the tracks at Tremont. On foot, they re-encounter the Orphans―who the Warriors humiliated prior. Swan makes peace, and Orphans' leader Sully allows them to walk through their territory unharmed; his partner Mercy mocks him, instigating a confrontation. The Warriors use a molotov cocktail, blowing up Sully's car and Mercy follows the Warriors.\n\nSwan, Mercy and the Warriors arrive on the 96th Street and Broadway in Manhattan, where they are detected by the police and separated. Three of them board a train to Union Square. As Mercy escapes, Fox struggles with a police officer, falls to the tracks and is killed by an oncoming train. Swan and the other three run outside, and are chased into Riverside Park by the Baseball Furies, where a fight ensues and the Warriors emerge victorious. After fighting, Ajax notices a lone woman in the park; he is sexually aggressive and is arrested when the woman is revealed to be an undercover cop.\n\nIn the meantime at Union Square, Rembrandt, Vermin, and Cochise are seduced by an all-female gang the Lizzies, only to learn its a trap. The trio escape, learning the truth―that everyone believes they killed Cyrus. Swan meets with Mercy and travel to Union Square where they are stalked by the Punks but the pair reunite with the other Warriors and defeat the Punks later on in the toilets. The Riffs receive a tip-off from a gang member who attended the meeting and witnessed Luther shoot Cyrus dead.\n\nThe Warriors finally arrive at Coney Island, where the Rogues are waiting for them and decide to face them. Luther freely admits to the murder and Swan suggests he and Luther have a one-on-one, but the Rogue leader pulls out his gun. Swan throws his knife at Luther's arm, disarming him. The Riffs arrive in force to confront the Rogues and make peace with the Warriors, before turning to fight the Rogues and a shattered Luther; the DJ announces the big alert has been called off and apologises to the Warriors saluting them with a song―\"In The City\". Swan, Mercy, and the Warriors safe and finally home walk down the beach.\n\nRockstar Games began working on \"The Warriors\" in 2002. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game were developed by Rockstar Toronto, who were previously known as Rockstar Canada. Promotion of the game was aided by its appearance at E3 2005. The game was later ported to the PlayStation Portable platform, and developed by Rockstar Leeds. This was first announced in October 2006, and Rockstar Leeds worked with original developers Rockstar Toronto in order to make the port easier. A spokesperson had said \"We have worked closely with Rockstar Toronto to maintain the extremely high standards they've set for this game,\" said Gordon Hall, President of Rockstar Leeds. \"The PSP system allows us to deliver the experience in an entirely different way, while staying very faithful to the original source material and maintaining the high standards we set for ourselves as a developer.\"\n\n\"The Warriors\" then began to look a lot like several of Rockstar's other projects such as \"\", \"Manhunt\", and \"Red Dead Revolver\". The look and presentation are definitely familiar, despite coming from different production houses, each developer shares their toolsets and proprietary technologies with each other on a consistent basis A combination of the company's biggest hits like \"State of Emergency and Manhunt\", \"The Warriors\" successfully mixed multi-character co-op brawling with stealth action. Just as was the case on PlayStation 2, if there is anything that positively sticks out regarding how \"The Warriors\" plays, it's the surprising depth of its characters. All nine playable fighters, while similar, have their own unique selection of moves and strengths and offer slightly different takes on the same concept. Due to the PlayStation Portable being a handheld platform, differences to gameplay came about as a result of the port, such as the control configuration receiving a drastic change.\n\nDuring the review, a spokesman had stated \"the audio, on the other hand, is on the other side of the scale\". Many of the original actors from the film have returned to voice their characters—at least, most of the ones that are \"still alive\". Michael Beck, James Remar, and Dorsey Wright once again were praised in their excellent performances (despite sounding quite a bit older than the 20-something characters they play), and the remaining voice cast delivers, too. The spokesman further explains \"it helps that the dialogue is well written, but there's hardly a bad voice actor in the bunch; the one weird thing about the voice work, though, is that a lot of it is made up of lines directly from the film.\" It seems as though, in some situations, Rockstar might have been better off just taking audio directly from the film rather than rerecording it. Obviously, they'd want the voices to match, but there are situations in which they could have easily gotten away with it, and ultimately would've had a better piece of dialogue. The audio in this game is great. As the spokesperson further explained he said: \"To begin with the voice acting for all characters in the game is very, very good. From all the main characters to plain NPCs, each and everyone is done amazingly. On the subject of sound effects in the game it's also very good. Every little thing makes a sound and does it well.\"\n\n\"The Warriors\" features voice actors for both the 1979 film and the game versions. The film and game version cast Michael Beck as Swan, the protagonist of \"The Warriors\". Other notable voice actors included returning actors, James Remar as Ajax, Deborah Van Valkenburgh as Mercy, Dorsey Wright as Cleon, Thomas G. Waites as Fox, and David Harris as Cochise. A special effort was made to preserve the official voice actors of characters from \"The Warriors\" movie used in the game itself.\n\nWhile the movie version featured David Patrick Kelly as Luther, Roger Hill as Cyrus, and Marcelino Sánchez as Rembrandt, the game version featured Oliver Wyman as Luther, Andy Senor as Rembrandt, Joe Lo Truglio as Vermin, Michael Potts as Cyrus, and Kurt Bauccio as Cowboy. Supporting characters involves Darryl McDaniels and Jordan Gelber.\n\nUpon its release, \"The Warriors\" received critical acclaim from critics. Many praised the game for its deep combat and control, stating that the game helped breathe life into the brawler genre. The game was also praised for its unique seedy underbelly style, along with its story and music. Critics praised the audio as it \"really shines above all else\", with a replicated soundtrack and absolutely superb voice acting by many of the original actors who starred in the film. Rockstar Toronto has gained the most media coverage for its development of \"The Warriors\", which overall received positive reviews, and made about $37 million worldwide. \"Like the best of Rockstar’s games, 'The Warriors' immerses you in a world that feels at once authentic and highly stylized, and it might just be the best game adaptation of a film ever in terms of capturing the mood of the original movie.\" 1UP admitted \"As fanservice, The Warriors is a treat for anyone who loves the movie, and as a beat-em-up, it outclasses recent efforts from competitors. Yet as a complete package, it's somewhat inconsistent. But with bonus missions, multiplayer rumbles, and a very fun 2-player co-op mode...we can most definitely dig it\". \"The Warriors\" received a score of 7.4 for the design, the story received 8.5, while the gameplay received 7.9.\n\"Game Informer\" praised the feel and style of the game, stating \"\"The Warriors\" immerses you in a world that feels at once authentic and highly stylized, and it might just be the best game adaptation of a film ever in terms of capturing the mood of the original movie. Fans will notice that all of the iconic scenes of the film are recreated almost shot for shot. In addition, Rockstar Toronto has gone to the trouble of creating a completely new storyline that shows players how the Warriors came together, and the events leading up to the start of the film.\" The reviewer went on to applaud the developers, saying they \"Tried to stretch the conventional formula for what's considered a \"brawler\". Unlike most of the genre, where you walk down single-path alleyways, The Warriors, taking cues from other popular Rockstar titles, creates the illusion that you’re in a real, living city.\n\nAlthough, sizewise, the levels are much closer to \"Manhunt\" than \"Grand Theft Auto\", there are areas to explore both on the ground and vertically, hidden items, amazing unlockables, and numerous side missions. They’ve also tried to expand the gameplay to incorporate more than just fisticuffs. You can engage in all sorts of petty crime, including muggings, stealing car stereos, lockpicking, and tagging graffiti. Throw in a little more variety in the form of some cool chase and stealth sequences, and you've got something more than a typical brawler.\"\n\nAs \"Game Informer\" further explained, they stated \"The fighting engine itself is fairly deep, allowing you to pull off some very brutal moves with a modicum of button presses (including some cool co-op maneuvers). You’ll definitely feel cool kicking ass as a Warrior, whether hand-to-hand or with any of the numerous weapons. However, I found the feel of the combat to be sluggish and chaotic at times, especially when fighting large numbers of enemies. He recommended that \"turning on the option that makes it stay in split-screen, but even that is hampered by your very narrow field of vision.\" Critics enjoyed the graffiti writing, which is done through an \"ingenious mechanic\". He stated \"Although it’s certainly not a masterpiece, The Warriors gets by on style, flair, variety, and simple fun. The gameplay – while still enjoyable – isn’t nearly as polished as it could be, the story and the appeal of the world that The Warriors recreates will be enough to pull you through to the end.\"\n\nIn 2006, Roger Hill, who also played Cyrus in the movie, filed a lawsuit of USD$250,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation) against Take-Two for using his voice and depiction in the game without his permission. He claimed that it would not have been difficult for Take-Two to pay, since the game made $37 million ($ when adjusted for inflation).\n\nA spiritual sequel was planned by Rockstar, which was to be unrelated to \"The Warriors\". The game was to be titled \"We Are The Mods\" and was to be set in 1960s England during the mods and rockers brawls. However, later in 2009, an arcade game was released entitled \"\" which is a beat 'em up scroller video game created by CXTM and released on Xbox Live Arcade. Dabel Brothers Productions in 2009, began a five issue comic book adaption of the film. Following that was a four issue mini series entitled \"The Warriors: Jail Break\", which takes place several months after the film's events.\n"}

He was one of the five co-founders of Factory Records and the founder and manager of the Haçienda nightclub. Wilson was known as \"Mr Manchester\", dubbed as such for his work in promoting the culture of Manchester throughout his career.\n\nHe was portrayed by Steve Coogan in Michael Winterbottom's 2002 film \"24 Hour Party People\", and by Craig Parkinson in Anton Corbijn's 2007 film \"Control\".\n\nWilson was born 20 February 1950 in Hope Hospital in the Hope area of Pendleton, Salford 6, Lancashire, to Sydney Wilson and Doris Knupfer, and moved to Marple, near Stockport in Cheshire, at the age of five. His maternal grandfather was a Jewish German immigrant. After passing his Eleven plus exam, Wilson attended De La Salle Grammar School in Weaste Lane, Pendleton, Salford. He developed a love of literature and language, ignited by a performance of \"Hamlet\" at Stratford upon Avon. Wilson started his professional career in 1968 at the age of 17, working as an English and Drama teacher at Blue Coat School in Oldham. He later graduated with a degree in English from Jesus College, Cambridge.\n\nAfter his graduation in 1971, Wilson began as a trainee news reporter for ITN, before moving to Manchester in 1973, where he secured a post at Granada Television. He went on to present Granada's culture, music and events programme, \"So It Goes\". Through the 1970s and 1980s he was one of the main anchors on \"Granada Reports\", a regional evening news programme, where he worked with Richard and Judy among others. He continued in this line of work even at the height of his success in the music industry.\n\nHe reported for ITV's celebrated current affairs series, \"World in Action\" in the early 1980s and from 1987 hosted \"After Dark\", the UK's first open-ended, late night chat show, in which he chaired live discussions in a darkened studio, first on Channel 4 and later BBC4. In 1989, Wilson hosted \"The Other Side of Midnight\", another Granada weekly regional culture slot, covering music, literature and the arts in general. Wilson co-presented the BBC's coverage of \"The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert\" at Wembley Stadium with Lisa I'Anson in 1992. He hosted the short-lived TV quiz shows \"Topranko!\" and MTV Europe's \"Remote Control\" in the 1990s, as well as the Manchester United themed quiz, \"Masterfan\", for MUTV.\n\nIn 2006 he became the regional political presenter for the BBC's \"The Politics Show\". He presented a weekly radio show on Xfm Manchester – \"Sunday Roast\" – and a show on BBC Radio Manchester. In October he joined Blur bassist Alex James, Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq and previously unknown presenter Emily Rose to host the 21st century version of the iconic 1980s music programme, \"The Tube\", for Channel 4 Radio which ran until 2 March 2007. His final music TV show was filmed in December 2006 for Manchester's Channel M. Only one episode, entitled 'The New Friday', was recorded before Wilson became ill.\n\nWilson's involvement in popular music stemmed from hosting Granada's culture and music programme \"So It Goes\". Wilson, who intensely disliked the music scene of the mid-1970s which was dominated by such genres as progressive rock and arena rock, saw the Sex Pistols at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall, in June 1976, an experience which he described as \"nothing short of an epiphany\". He booked them for the last episode of the first series, probably the first television showing of their revolutionary British strand of punk rock.\n\nHe was the manager of many bands, including A Certain Ratio and the Durutti Column, and was part owner and manager of Factory Records, home of Happy Mondays, Joy Division and New Order – the band managed by friend and business partner Rob Gretton. He also founded and managed the Haçienda nightclub and Dry Bar, together forming a central part of the music and cultural scene of Manchester. The scene was termed \"Madchester\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nHe made little money from Factory Records or the Haçienda, despite the enormous popularity and cultural significance of both endeavours. Both Factory Records and the Haçienda came to an abrupt end in the late 1990s.\n\nA semi-fictionalised version of his life and of the surrounding era was made into the 2002 film, \"24 Hour Party People\", which stars Steve Coogan as Wilson. After the film was produced, Wilson wrote a novelisation based on the screenplay. He played a minor role (playing himself) in the 2005 film, \"A Cock and Bull Story\", in which his character interviews Steve Coogan. Wilson also co-produced the 2007 Ian Curtis biopic, \"Control\" (his character this time being played by Craig Parkinson). He died a few months before its release.\n\nWilson was a partner in the annual 'In the City' and 'Interactive City' music festivals and industry conferences, and also F4 Records, the fourth version of Factory Records, which was set up to be an online distributor for Wilson's long term protégé Vini Reilly, of the Durutti Column.\n\nWilson identified himself as a socialist and refused to pay for private healthcare on principle. Wilson was also an outspoken supporter of regionalism. Along with others including Ruth Turner, he started a campaign for North West England to be allowed a referendum on the creation of a regional assembly, called the \"Necessary Group\" after a line in the United States Declaration of Independence. Although his campaign was successful, with the Government announcing that a vote would take place, this was later abandoned when North East England voted against the introduction of a regional tier of government. Wilson later spoke at several political events on this subject. He was also known for using Situationist ideas.\n\nWilson's goal of a strong regional political settlement was eventually achieved in 2017, ten years after his death, with the election of a “Metro Mayor” for Greater Manchester and an equivalent for Merseyside.\n\nWilson was married twice, first to Lindsay Reade and then to Hilary, with whom he had a son, Oliver, and a daughter, Isabel. In 1990 he started a relationship with Yvette Livesey, a former Miss England and Miss UK, who was his girlfriend until his death in 2007.\nLivesey has since co-operated with a biography of Wilson's life, called \"You're Entitled to an Opinion ...\", written by David Nolan and published in 2009.\n\nAfter Wilson developed renal cancer and had one kidney removed in 2007, doctors recommended he take the drug Sutent (a.k.a. sunitinib). Manchester Primary Care NHS Trust refused to fund the £3,500 per month cost of providing the drug, while patients being treated alongside him at the Christie Hospital and living just a few miles away in Cheshire did receive funding for the medication.\n\nA number of Wilson's music industry friends, including former Happy Mondays manager Nathan McGough, their current manager Elliot Rashman and TV stars Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan, formed a fund to help pay for Wilson's medical treatment.\n\nWilson said: \"This [Sutent] is my only real option. It is not a cure but can hold the cancer back, so I will probably be on it until I die. When they said I would have to pay £3,500 for the drugs each month, I thought where am I going to find the money? I'm the one person in this industry who famously has never made any money. I used to say 'some people make money and some make history', which is very funny until you find you can't afford to keep yourself alive. I've never paid for private healthcare because I'm a socialist. Now I find you can get tummy tucks and cosmetic surgery on the NHS but not the drugs I need to stay alive. It is a scandal.\"\n\nIn early 2007 emergency surgery was performed to remove one of his kidneys. This forced the postponement of plans to create a Southern Hemisphere version of the In the City festival. Despite the surgery, the cancer progressed and a course of chemotherapy was not effective. Wilson died of a heart attack in Manchester's Christie Hospital on 10 August 2007 aged 57. Following the news of his death, the Union Flag on Manchester Town Hall was lowered to half mast as a mark of respect. \n\nProbate documents reveal his estate was valued at £484,747 after tax. That figure includes the value of his city centre flat on Little Peter Street. The will, signed by Wilson on 4 July 2007, gave Yvette Livesey, 39, his girlfriend of 17 years, the proceeds from their home. He also left her his share of six businesses. His son Oliver and daughter Isabel shared the rest of his estate.\nHis funeral was at St Mary's RC Church, Mulberry Street, Manchester (The Hidden Gem) on 20 August 2007. As with everything else in the Factory empire, Tony Wilson's coffin was also given a Factory catalogue number: FAC 501. He is buried at Southern Cemetery in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester. His black granite headstone, erected in October 2010, was designed by Peter Saville and Ben Kelly and features a quotation, chosen by Wilson's family, from Mrs G Linnaeus Banks's 1876 novel \"The Manchester Man\", set in Rotis serif font. The quotation reads: \"Mutability is the epitaph of worlds/ Change alone is changeless/ People drop out of the history of a life as of a land though their work or their influence remains.\"\n\nThe main square of the HOME/First Street development in Manchester, which opened in 2015, is named Tony Wilson Place.\n\n"}
{"id": "31045577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31045577", "title": "Turboweekend", "text": "Turboweekend\n\nTurboweekend is a Danish synthesizer rock band, formed in 2006 by the three childhood friends Martin Øhlers Petersen, Silas Bjerregaard and Morten Køie. Anders Stig Møller joined the live shows in 2009, and was made official member in 2011 during the recordings of their latest studio album Fault Lines.\n\nMorten, Martin and Silas formed their first band in 8th grade and in the following years played together in several different constellations before forming Turboweekend in late 2005. \"Into You\" the band's first radio hit, was recorded in early 2006, and Turboweekend played their debut concert in April that year. During 2006 the band became increasingly popular at the Copenhagen hipster parties, and was eventually booked for Roskilde Festival 2007. The debut album \"Night Shift\" was released October 1, 2007 on Copenhagen Records. In 2008 the band played at Danish radio award show \"P3 Guld\" and was nominated as \"Newcomer of the Year\" at both \"P3 Guld\" and \"Zulu Awards\". In mid-2008 the band started working on their second album Ghost Of A Chance.\n\nTurboweekend's second album \"Ghost of a Chance\" was released March 23, 2009 on Mermaid Records/Sony Music. \n\"Ghost of a Chance\" became the band's breakthrough record in their home country and nominated them for the main prize \"P3 Prisen\" at P3 Guld 2010. October 16, 2009, \"Ghost of a Chance\" was released in Germany and Switzerland and in 2010 in Poland on Sony Music. The first single \"Trouble Is\" reached number 1 on the German college radio playlist. In the spring of 2010 Dutch DJ Tiësto's remix of \"Trouble Is\" was released worldwide.\n\nIn July 2010 the band played at Roskilde Festival again.

Turboweekend was among the 5 nominees for MTV Europe Music Awards \"Best Danish Act\" at the show in Madrid in November 2010.\n\nAt P3 Guld on January 14, 2011 the band won the award \"P3 Breakthrough\". The album \"Ghost of a Chance\" was certified Gold in January 2011 in Denmark. At the Danish Music Awards in November, Turboweekend won the award for \"Best Danish Live Act\". Keyboard player Anders Stig Møller, who previously only had been hired as a live musician, became a part of the band, as they started working on songs for what would become their 3rd full length studio album Fault Lines.\n\nIn February 2012, Turboweekend signed a deal with EMI Nordic (now Parlophone), for the release of their 3rd full length studio album Fault Lines. In Denmark the album went #1 in the week of its release and first single On My Side was elected Hit Of The Year (shared 1st place) by listener votes on national radio P3. \nIn April the band went on a 24 date European tour through The Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Poland and in March they released the Shadow Sounds ep containing stripped down versions of 6 songs from previous releases, which the band had rearranged for a small mini-tour in February at a handful of intimate venues. The European tour in April was followed up by a couple of festival shows in Switzerland, The Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany, as well as gigs in Denmark at Skive, Nibe, Trailerpark and Skanderborg festivals. The band is currently working on their 4th studio album.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
