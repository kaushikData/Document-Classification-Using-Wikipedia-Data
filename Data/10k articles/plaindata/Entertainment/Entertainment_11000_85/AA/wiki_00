Bodily mutilation is most usually portrayed in the context of horror, but is also used in other genres, such as medical dramas or war films. It is used primarily either to shock or fascinate the audience of a film, or to add a sense of realism to a film. Improved special effects in recent decades have seen an increase in the prevalence of bodily mutilation in film.\n\nIn the early years of motion picture history, horror was often used in order to attract and intrigue audiences. To frighten and fascinate the audience was the goal. Lon Chaney was well known for his portrayals in various horror films, but the subject in focus is his use of makeup to create his ghastly visages. He was known as “the man of 1,000 faces.” (Rickett 2000) Chaney was arguably one of the forerunners of makeup use in horror films. Some others include actors Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr. But it was the man behind their makeup, Jack Pierce, who made them what they were (Rickett 2000). While these movie makers didn’t make films rife with violence and mutilation, their influence on later film makers was great. Early horror movies focused on suspense and monsters but as realism has progressed, movie makers have focused more on realistically portraying the horrible fate of whoever is unfortunate enough to fall victim to the fell devices.\n\nAlthough there was a boom of monster and alien flicks in the 50s and movie makers using make up more for realistic depictions of violence and gore in the 60s, the advent of realism in horror as we now know it arguably began with the 1973 film \"The Exorcist\". This was the first of its kind as far as special effects used realistically to portray gruesome scenes. This movie, created by director William Friedkin with make up master Dick Smith directing the effects set the stage for countless other such films to be made. After the release of The Exorcist and its subsequent popularity scary movies began to shift and the violent horror flick became a major genre. With effects greats Kevin Yagher, Dick Smith, and Tom Savini behind such classic horror films as \"Friday the 13th\" (1980), \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984), \"Halloween\" (1978), and \"Dawn of the Dead\" (1978) this genre gained immense popularity (Rickett 2000). This craze peaked during the 80’s went down a little in the 90’s but with the movie \"Scream\" (1996) horror movies were back in. As special effects continue to get better, so the horror films continue to grow even more violent, gruesome, and realistic in their portrayals of human mutilation as can be seen in the recent \"Saw\" films (2004,2005, 2006, 2007) as well as others such as \"Hostel\" (2005) and \"\" (2007). However horror films are not the only movies that have worked to realistically portray bodily mutilation.\n\nWar movies have often romanticized battle and violence for glory; but after the Vietnam War, many movies worked to portray war in its true form, all the violence, brutality, and even the psychological distress included. This is shown in several films including \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978) and \"Casualties of War\" (1989). A great example is the classic film \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998). In the beginning of this movie there is a 15-minute scene showing the landing of American troops at Omaha beach. In this scene there are untold amounts of blood and gore as German machine guns literally rip the U.S. soldiers apart. Other war movies such as \"Flags of Our Fathers\" (2006), \"Enemy at the Gates\" (2001), and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" (2006) work to show the effects of battle on the human body.\n\nNowadays, you can find body mutilation in many different kinds of movies. Some of the more common examples are in movies or shows that depict hospital or law enforcement. As hospital and police movies and TV shows gain popularity and attempt to make the situation more real, they have utilized techniques to make operations and crimes as realistic as possible. This includes breaks, burns, cuts, surgery, and violent attacks. This portrayal is often graphic, but accurate. Regardless of intent, movies have progressed greatly from the early years of Chaney and Pierce in the realistic portrayals of bodily mutilation.\n\nAlthough not a pioneer when it comes to mutilation, Lon Chaney was the inspiration for many film makers who were. Born on April 1, 1883 in Colorado Springs, Colorado to deaf mute parents, Lon Chaney did not have the easiest childhood (Anderson 1997). However, this did not prevent him from becoming a magician with makeup. Throughout many various films, Chaney perfected his craft. He did his makeup for all the films he was in. Chaney’s makeup kit set the standard for later makeup departments in Hollywood. While his most widely known films are \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1923) and \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1925), perhaps some of his most important contributions to modern horror films and their emphasis on the mutilation came from his work in lesser known films. For example, Chaney used collodian to make realistic scars and deformities for his characters Singapore Joe in \"The Road to Mandalay\" (1926), Ricardo in \"Victory\" (1919), and Tiger Haynes in \"Where East is East\" (1929). Chaney died on August 26, 1930 in Los Angeles, California due to complications with throat cancer (Anderson 1997).\n\nJack Pierce did the makeup man behind popular monster creatures \"Frankenstein\" (1931), \"The Mummy\" (1932), and \"The Wolf Man\" (1941) (Rickett 2000).\n\nBorn on June 26, 1922, Dick Smith is one of the most influential men on the art of makeup. As John Caglione Jr. put it, “No one will ever take over for Dick Smith. In forty-five years of doing makeup, I don’t think anyone’s touched him. He is the heavyweight champion of makeup (Timpone 1996).” Master of makeup, Smith helmed many movies’ special effects, but he excelled in prosthetics and age makeup. Notable examples are that of Marlon Brando as the Don in \"The Godfather\" (1972) and F. Murray Abraham as Salieri in \"Amadeus\" (1984). He also did age makeup for Max von Sydow as Father Merrin in \"The Exorcist\" making this 44-year-old look 74 (Multimedia Publications 1986). In this movie he made maybe his greatest contribution to modern mutilation technique with the 360° turn of Linda Blair’s head. This scene complete with vomit spewing and severe facial distortions set the bar for future film makers. Although possibly his greatest contribution to horror, it was not his last. He later worked on other films including the 1977 film The Sentinel in which he coordinated the effects for a gruesome nose and eye slashing (Timpone 1996) among other things.\nKnown as the King of Splatter (Rickett 2000), Tom Savini has quite a reputation for his work in horror movies much of which has included severe bodily mutilation in many circumstances. According to Anthony Timpone in his book \"Men, Makeup, and Monsters\", Savini started his career young. Earlier makeup artists provided him with inspiration. “Lon Chaney became a hero,” he said. Drafted into the military during the Vietnam War, he became a combat photographer. He would practice his craft on the men he was with, but also got a taste of true gore. “I’ve seen the real stuff.” While in Vietnam, Savini saw many gruesome sights including bodies in rigor mortis and even a dismembered arm. This may have provided him with material he would later use in his movies. And he did use gore and violence in his movies. Perhaps this is stated best by Timpone.\n\n“Prior to Savini’s work on \"Dawn of the Dead\", realistic screen slaughter had rarely gone to the unrated extremes it would soon reach in the early 80s with Savini’s guidance. Via his macabre tricks, heads were severed, scalped, axed, exploded, and pierced. Machetes hacked off limbs, fangs tore through chunks of human flesh, and blood bags sprayed gallons of grue. Zombies, ghouls, demons, hideously disfigured maniacs, and other assorted Savini-created monsters racked up endless body counts.” \n\nThis master of splatter was behind many horror films’ effects including \"Martin\" (1978), \"Maniac,\" \"Friday the 13th\" (1980), \"\" (1984), \"Day of the Dead\" (1985), \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\" (1986), and \"Two Evil Eyes\" (1990). “My job is to create the stuff as realistically as possible.” \n\nRick Baker is known mainly for his work making ape films (Timpone 1996). However, he is well known for his work on \"An American Werewolf in London\" (1981), specifically the on screen transformation of the main character into a werewolf (Multimedia Publications 2986). While this may not be considered mutilation, the transformation is a radical change from human to monster and therefore evokes many of the same emotions.\n\nMastermind behind the psychotic doll Chucky, Kevin Yagher is known for his work with animatronics (Timpone 1996). He also did effects for the Nightmare on Elm Street movies 2-4.\n\nBob Keen did effects on the movies \"Hellraiser\" (1987) and \"Nightbreed\" (1990)\n\n\"The Exorcist\" (1973)\nWith the Linda Blair head turn and accompanying effects, this film inspired many film makers.\n\n\"Martin\" (1978)\nThis may not be a particularly fantastic movie, but the scene where Martin, the title character, slits the wrist of an unconscious girl shows a clever trick used to fool the audience into believing in the realism of the action.\n\n\"Dawn of the Dead\" (1978)\nThis film was very original. In fact, according to effects man Tom Savini, this film was largely improvised during its making. “We’d be sitting around thinking of ways to kill a zombie.” These ways include stabbing one in the ear with a screwdriver, and cutting one’s head to pieces with a helicopter’s rotors.\n\n\"Halloween\" (1978) and sequels\n\n\"Friday the 13th\" (1980) and sequels\n\n\"The Howling\" (1981)\nWith its full on screen transformation and a scene where Eddie Quist gets acid flung into his face before a transformation, this movie shows the human body realistically distorted, and mutilated in the case of the acid, in a way new to film at the time.\n\n\"An American Werewolf in London\" (1981)\nReleased in the same year as The Howling, this movie also showed the change from man to wolf. It also shows some pretty gruesome undead. While released later than The Howling this movie used some innovative techniques developed by Rick Baker and who went on to win an Oscar for his makeup on the film. (Hollywood tricks of the trade page 133)\n\n\"The Evil Dead\" (1981)\nThis movie may not have been particularly successful or popular, but the makers were creative when faced with production problems, including having to come up with their own formula for fake blood. This consisted of corn syrup, food coloring, and instant coffee to thicken it (Multimedia Publications 1986).\n\n\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984) and sequels\n\n\"Scream\" (1996) and sequels\n\n\"ER\" (1994-2009)\n\n\"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998)\n\n\"\" (2000- ) and spin offs (Miami, New York, etc.)\n\n\"Black Hawk Down\" (2001)\n\n\"Saw\" (2004) and sequels\n\n\"Hostel\" (2005) and sequels\n\n\"Hatchet\" (2006) and sequels\n\nThe tricks of the trade are what make these effects convincing. The following are a few basic techniques or tricks that have been used to create the image of mutilation.\nFake blood can be made in many different ways. One of the cheapest and easiest can be made with varying recipes including corn syrup and food dye. For example, in the movie \"The Evil Dead\" the makers used a mixture consisting of corn syrup, food coloring, and instant coffee. Fake blood is used in nearly every, if not every single, movie that has shown bodily mutilation, be it human or otherwise. Some effective uses of fake blood include use of a squib, or small explosive device, with a metal plate between the actor and the squib and a packet of fake blood to simulate the blood splatter that would accompany a gunshot for example. Another used for fake blood is seen in the movie \"Martin\" when the main character cuts the wrist of a girl. This trick is accomplished by hiding a syringe or bulb behind the fake weapon and squeezing out the fake blood as the weapon is drawn across the victim.\n\nFake scars can be made in many different ways. Actor Lon Chaney used collodian. In more recent years, with the advent of latex and plastics there are many ways to make fake flesh and scarring.\nBurns are used in many films and correct technique can create a more effective visual. For first degree burns, merely put down a red foundation with a little purple on top. Use skin colored powder to prevent the “burn” from shining. For a second degree burn create fake blistering surrounded by the standard first degree reddening. To create the blistering, you can use petroleum jelly in saran wrap, or using pure gum latex and lifting the center after drying. Third degree burns are severe and should reflect that in the effect. The skin is charred and broken. This effect can be achieved with the latex, plastic wax material, or other plastic appliance. Be sure to color the burned flesh convincingly, then gradient from third degree burn, to second degree to first.\n\nLatex is a synthetic rubber often used in special effects. Foamed latex is sometimes considered the \"ultimate in prosthetic appliance.\" It can be used in an inflatable bladder effect to make it seem like the actor’s skin is moving or rippling like Rick Baker’s werewolf change effect An American Werewolf in London. This is accomplished by covering an inflatable balloon of some type underneath a covering made of latex, urethane, or plastic molding. Latex can also be used to make scar effects or other more blatant mutilation. For example, with latex prosthetics, movie makers can make an actor appear to have more or less limbs than he should. They can also make the actor appear to be horribly wounded with flesh hanging and large gashes. To accomplish these tricks, the actor must first have a mold made of the part of him that will be replicated using latex. Take, as an example, one of the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. To make this actor seem to be rotting, they need to make a cast. The technicians prep the area of the body, say the face, to be cast. They must cover the hair and coat the eyebrows, eyelashes, and any other hair that can’t be covered with petroleum jelly. Then they must apply the alginate or other comparable substance, completely covering the molding area, keeping the mouth, nose, or both open for breathing. When that is finished, they layer the area with plaster bandages to create the cast. When all of it has dried and settled, they remove the cast from the actor and put it together again to create the mold. After this, they pour plaster of Paris into the mold to create a cast that is exactly like the actors face. From the cast they can get another mold which they then can use to sculpt any prosthetic attachments they need. This can include fake limbs, fake skin, or growths. It is important to use the a good adhesive to apply the prosthetic. In his book Vincent Kehoe recommends one that is \"easy to apply, set[s] rapidly, be dilutable for use, and be removable with a solvent that is not harmful to the skin.\n\n\n"}

But a killer shark ruins their plans. It attacks the beach community and kills John while he is swimming.\n\nThe three remaining friends decide to avenge John's death and hunt the beast. Their task will not be easy, since a legend says that the beast is an incarnation of an ancient hoodoo spirit that has taken the form of a killer shark. The boys set an underwater trap for the shark and lure it into an area in which they have planted powerful explosives, thereby successfully killing the beast.\n\nJoe D'Amato had got to know Raffaele Donato in 1975 on the set of \"Red Coats\" and had later used him repeatedly as English dialogue coach. He found him again in the United States and wanted him on the project because he needed someone who could speak English well.\n\nIn an interview D'Amato gave for the book \"Spaghetti Nightmares\", he stated that Donato had wanted to direct a film himself, but had seen after directing the first scene, which also happened to be the first scene of the film at the beach, that this was not what he wanted. D'Amato had therefore finished the film on his own.\n\nThe film for a time carried the working title \"Wakan\". It was announced under the title \"Sharks (The Challenge)\" and as directed by \"David Hills\" (one of D'Amato's pseudonyms), but D'Amato stated that he finally decided to credit Rafaelle Donato for the release since he himself had already shot many films during that year and wanted to avoid that it became apparent he was doing everything himself. \n\nThe shark scenes are extrapolated from stock footage bought from the National Geographic Society. In the scene of the explosion killing the shark, footage from \"Great White\" is used.\n\n\nThe tagline on the cover of a VHS release titled \"Sharks\" reads, \"Where sharks prey, the ocean is a bloodbath.\"\n\nIn Italy, a VHS release was made by Avo Film.\n\nIn Germany, the film was released by \"VPS\" on VHS titled \"Shakka - Bestie der Tiefe\" (literally: \"Shakka - Beast of the Depth\").\n\nIn the Czech Republic, the film was released on DVD by \"Řitka video\" in 2009, under the title \"Bestie z hlubin\". The DVD contains the Czech dub and the English original version with forced Czech subtitles.\n\nIn 1999, Italian film critic Marco Giusti called the film a Z movie version of \"Jaws\". He thought that the dialogues were slightly ridiculous, but that the small film was likable.\n\n\n"}

These 3-axis stabilized satellites carry a single 24 MHz, 200 W transponder, feeding a 28 dB gain antenna transmitting on right-hand circular polarization to produce equivalent isotropically radiated powers in Siberia in the range 50 to 55 dBW at 714 MHz. The corresponding feeder link uses left-hand circular polarization at 6200 MHz. Therefore, almost every householder could receive the TV signal at home from Ekran's transponder using a simple Yagi-Uda antenna.

Amanda Congdon and Andrew Baron were initially tied to the first few episodes of the production, but the partnership dissolved with the \"Rocketboom\" split in July 2006.\n\nIn April 2007, JETSET was the first established web show to sign with web video studio Next New Networks (NNN). NNN took the role of selling sponsorship and handling cross-promotion for the show. In its tenure with NNN, the show grew from 30,000-40,000 views per episode to 3 million views a month.\n\nIn October 2007, Smashface Productions decided to change the name of the show from JETSET to Epic Fu, citing a need to protect their intellectual property with a more original name.\n\nAfter a year with NNN, Epic Fu was contemplating a move to television, but then signed with West Coast digital studio Revision3 in June 2008. This was notable because at the time EPIC FU was the highest profile web show to switch from one new media studio to another. The partnership ended shortly after in December 2008, when Revision3 laid off nine employees, cancelled three original shows and eliminated two of its distribution deals, citing that the shows didn't fit with their long-term plans.\n\nCurrently, Epic Fu is independently run and distributed through Blip.tv.\n\nEpisodes of Epic Fu are produced by Smashface Productions and filmed in Los Angeles, California.

{"id": "39507756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39507756", "title": "Gone Girl (film)", "text": "Gone Girl (film)\n\nGone Girl is a 2014 American psychological thriller film directed by David Fincher and written by Gillian Flynn, based on her 2012 novel of the same title. The film stars Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, and Tyler Perry. Set in Missouri, the story begins as a mystery that follows the events surrounding Nick Dunne (Affleck), who becomes the primary suspect in the sudden disappearance of his wife, Amy (Pike).\n\nThe film had its world premiere on opening night of the 52nd New York Film Festival on September 26, 2014, before a nationwide theatrical release on October 3. It was received well critically and was a commercial success, grossing $369 million, making it the highest-grossing film by Fincher.\n\nRosamund Pike's performance was particularly praised, and she received nominations for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress. Additional nominations included a Golden Globe Award for Best Director for Fincher and Golden Globe Award, BAFTA, and Critics' Choice Award nominations for Flynn's adapted screenplay, receiving the award for the latter.\n\nThe day of their fifth wedding anniversary, writing teacher Nick Dunne returns home to find his wife Amy is missing. Her disappearance receives heavy press coverage because Amy was the inspiration for her parents' popular \"Amazing Amy\" children's books. Detective Rhonda Boney does a walkthrough of their house and finds poorly concealed evidence of a struggle. The police conduct a forensic analysis and uncover the remnants of cleaned blood stains, leading to the conclusion that Amy was murdered. Suspicions arise that Nick is responsible, and his apathetic behavior is interpreted by the media as characteristic of a sociopath.\n\nFlashbacks reveal that Nick and Amy's marriage had disintegrated; both lost their jobs in the recession and moved from New York City to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, Missouri. Nick became lazy and distant, and began cheating on Amy with one of his students. Boney unearths evidence of financial troubles and domestic disputes, and a witness states that Amy wanted to purchase a gun. She also finds a medical report indicating that Amy is pregnant, of which Nick denies knowledge, and a diary supposedly written by Amy highlighting her growing isolation, ominously ending with the fear that Nick will kill her.\n\nAmy is revealed to be alive and well, having changed her appearance and gone into hiding in a distant campground in the Ozarks. Upon learning that Nick was cheating on her, she resolved to punish him by framing him for her murder. Amy plans the framing in great detail: she befriends a pregnant neighbor to steal her urine for the pregnancy test, drains her own blood to leave traces of evidence of murder and fabricates a diary describing her fear of Nick. She also has Nick increase her life insurance so it looks like he murdered her for the money. By using the clues in a \"treasure hunt\" game she and Nick play on their anniversary, she ensures he visits places where she has planted the corroborating evidence of Nick's guilt for the police to discover. She anticipates Nick will be convicted and executed for her murder, and contemplates committing suicide after his conviction.\n\nNick hires Tanner Bolt, a lawyer who specializes in defending men accused of killing or raping their wives. Nick meets Amy's ex-boyfriend Tommy O'Hara, who says Amy falsely accused him of rape, and gradually deduces Amy's plan. He also approaches another ex-boyfriend, the wealthy Desi Collings, against whom Amy previously filed a restraining order, but Desi refuses to share any details. When Amy's neighbors at the campground rob her of her remaining money, she calls Desi and convinces him that she ran away from Nick because he was abusing her. He agrees to hide her in his lake house, which is equipped with surveillance cameras.\n\nNick convinces his twin sister, Margo, of his innocence. After Nick's mistress reveals their affair at a press conference, Nick appears on a talk show to profess his innocence and apologize for his failures as a husband in the hope of luring Amy. His performance rekindles Amy's feelings for him, even as Boney arrests him for Amy's murder. Amy inflicts injuries on herself and uses Desi's surveillance cameras to her advantage, making it appear that Desi kidnapped and raped her. She seduces Desi and kills him during sex by slitting his throat. Covered in Desi's blood, she returns home and names him as her captor and rapist, clearing Nick of suspicion.\n\nWhen Boney questions Amy about the holes in her story, Amy accuses her of incompetence. The FBI sides with Amy, forcing Boney to back down. Amy tells Nick the truth, saying that the man she watched pleading for her return on TV is the man she wants him to become again. Nick shares this with Boney, Bolt, and Margo, but they have no way to prove Amy's guilt.\n\nNick intends to leave Amy and expose her lies, but Amy reveals she is pregnant, having artificially inseminated herself with Nick's sperm stored at a fertility clinic. Nick doubts the child is his and says he will take a paternity test. He then reacts violently to Amy's insistence that they remain married, but feels responsible for the child. Despite Margo's objections, Nick reluctantly decides to stay with Amy. The \"happy\" couple announces on television that they are expecting a child.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" is a film adaptation of Flynn's 2012 novel of the same name. One of the film's executive producers, Leslie Dixon, read the manuscript of the novel in 2011 and brought it to the attention of Reese Witherspoon (who was originally slated to play Amy) in December of that year. Witherspoon and Dixon then collaborated with Bruna Papandrea to further develop the manuscript—with Flynn's film agent, Shari Smiley, they met with film studios in early 2012.\n\nFollowing the release of the novel in June 2012, the 20th Century Fox studio optioned the book in a deal with Flynn, in which the author negotiated that she would be responsible for the first draft of the screenplay. By around October 2012, Flynn was engaged in the production of the first draft while she was also involved in the promotional tour for her novel. A first-time screenwriter at the time, Flynn later admitted: \"I certainly felt at sea a lot of times, kind of finding my way through.\"\n\nFlynn submitted her first draft screenplay to the Fox studio in December 2012, before Fincher was selected as the director for the project. Fincher had already expressed interest in the project, and after he finished reading Flynn's first draft, a meeting was scheduled between the director and author within days. Typically, authors are removed from film adaptations following the first draft and an experienced screenwriter takes over; but, on this occasion, Fincher agreed to work with Flynn for the entire project. Flynn later explained: \"... he [Fincher] responded to the first draft and we have kind of similar sensibilities. We liked the same things about the book, and we wanted the same thing out of the movie.\"\n\nAs further preparation, Flynn studied screenplay books and also met with Steve Kloves, who wrote the screenplays for the \"Harry Potter\" series. Fincher also provided guidance and advised the author: \"We don't have the ability to gift the audience with the characters' thoughts, so tell me how they're behaving.\" During the production of the final screenplay, Fincher and Flynn engaged in an intensive back-and-forth working relationship: Flynn sent Fincher \"big swaths\" of writing, which he then reviewed, and Fincher would then discuss the swaths with Flynn by telephone. Eventually, some scenes were rewritten \"a dozen times\", while other scenes were unaltered.\n\nFollowing the release of the film, Flynn spoke of an overwhelming adaptation process, in which she tackled a 500-page book with an intricate plot; she explained that her experience working for a magazine meant that she \"wasn't ever precious about cutting.\" As a consequence of the distillation process, most of the parental storylines were lost, so the mother of the character of Desi Collings does not appear in the film, and it was not possible to include flashbacks of Nick Dunne's dead mother.\n\nIn terms of the film's ending, Flynn revealed that she experimented with a \"lot of iterations\". One of the aspects that she was certain of was the presence of the media, which she described as the \"third player\", alongside Nick and Amy. In Flynn's words: \"Once we got to the ending, I wanted it to wrap up quickly. I didn't want 8 million more loop-de-loops ... I had no problem tossing stuff out and trying to figure out the best way to get there.\"\n\nFlynn enjoyed the experience of making the film, and she expressed appreciation for Fincher's involvement, as he \"really liked the book and didn't want to turn it into something other than what it already was\", and he also reassured her, even when she second-guessed herself. Fincher described Flynn's screenwriting work as \"very smart\", \"crafty\", and \"extremely articulate\".\n\nOn September 11, 2013, the \"Gone Girl\" film crew began filming establishing shots. Principal photography began on September 15 in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and was scheduled to last about five weeks. Some interior scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, with a door that could not be replicated being shipped there from Cape Girardeau.\n\nAccording to producer Ceán Chaffin, Fincher took, on average, as many as 50 takes for each scene, while Flynn has said that, although Fincher is a visual director, he is meticulous about veracity—Fincher changed a scene in which Amy collects her own blood, as he thought it was unbelievable.\n\nFincher later called Affleck \"extremely bright\" in regard to the manner in which he drew on his own experience with the media for the character of Nick Dunne. Fincher explained that Affleck \"has a great sense of humor and great wit about what this situation is and how frustrating it is\". Fincher described the behavior of the media in the film as \"tragedy vampirism\", but clarified that \"\"The New York Times\" and NPR are not in the flowerbeds of the Dunne house\".\n\nOn January 21, 2014, Trent Reznor announced that he and Atticus Ross would provide the score, marking their third collaboration with Fincher, following \"The Social Network\" and \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\". Fincher was inspired by music he heard while at an appointment with a chiropractor and tasked Reznor with creating the musical equivalent of an insincere façade. Reznor explained Fincher's request in an interview:\n\nThe overall score is a combination of soothing sounds with staccato electronic noises, resulting in an unnerving, anxiety invoking quality. NPR writer Andy Beta concludes: \"Reznor and Ross relish being at their most beauteous, knowing that it'll make the brutal moments of \"Gone Girl\" all the more harrowing.\" Richard Butler of The Psychedelic Furs sang a cover version of the song \"She\", which was used in the film's teaser trailer. The soundtrack album was released on the Columbia label on September 30, 2014.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" opened the 52nd New York Film Festival, receiving high-profile press coverage and early positive reviews. It saw a nationwide release in North America in 3,014 theatres on October 3, 2014. Coinciding with the North America release, \"Gone Girl\" released at 5,270 screens in 39 international markets like the United Kingdom and Germany, on its opening weekend.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on January 13, 2015. The Blu-ray release comes with a 36-page \"Amazing Amy\" book called \"Tattle Tale\". An audio commentary with David Fincher is the sole special feature included on the DVD/Blu-Ray.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" grossed $167.8 million in the U.S. and Canada and $201.6 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $369.3 million, against a production budget of $61 million. Calculating in all expenses, \"Deadline Hollywood\" estimated that the film made a profit of $129.99 million, making it one of the most profitable films of 2014.\n\nThe film was released on October 3, 2014 in North America in 3,014 theaters and earned $13.1 million on its opening day (including the $1.3 million it earned from Thursday late-night showings). It finished in first place at the North American box office earning $37.5 million after a neck-and-neck competition with Warner Bros./New Line Cinema's horror film \"Annabelle\" which earned $37.1 million. The film is the biggest debut of Fincher's career, (breaking \"Panic Room\"'s opening). It is also the third biggest opening weekend for Affleck, (behind \"Pearl Harbor\" which opened with $59.1 million and \"Daredevil\" which opened with $40.3 million) and Rosamund Pike's second biggest opening (behind \"Die Another Day\" which opened with $47 million). The film is the tenth biggest October debut overall. The film played 60% female and 75% over-25 years old. The film topped the box office for two consecutive weekends despite facing competition with \"Dracula Untold\" in its second weekend before being overtaken by \"Fury\" in its third weekend.\n\nOutside North America, it earned $24.6 million from 5,270 screens in 39 international markets on its opening weekend, higher than expected. High openings were witnessed in the United Kingdom ($6.7 million), Australia ($4.6 million), France ($3.65 million) Russia ($3.4 million), and Germany ($2.6 million).\n\n\"Gone Girl\" received positive reviews from critics, with Pike's performance in particular earning praise. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 87%, based on 327 reviews, with a rating average of 8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Dark, intelligent, and stylish to a fault, \"Gone Girl\" plays to director David Fincher's sick strengths while bringing the best out of stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a B grade.\n\nThe \"Vulture\"s critics praised the direction, script, editing, score, visual style, and performances, particularly from Pike, Affleck, Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon, and Missi Pyle. Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote: \"Superbly cast from the two at the top to the smallest speaking parts, impeccably directed by Fincher and crafted by his regular team to within an inch of its life, \"Gone Girl\" shows the remarkable things that can happen when filmmaker and material are this well matched.\" \"The Economist\" called the film a \"brilliantly glacial adaptation ... This may not be the perfect film—but it is a perfect adaptation\".\n\nJoshua Rothman wrote in \"The New Yorker\" that he enjoyed the film \"in all its abstract, intellectual, postmodern glory\" and that, similar to other post-modern narratives, the film adaptation is \"decisively unreal ... [the] heroes and villains in Fincher's \"Gone Girl\" aren't people but stories\". Rothman, who draws parallels between \"Gone Girl\" and Fincher's 1999 adaptation \"Fight Club\", decides that the film is ultimately a farce and has resonated with filmgoers because it expresses \"a creepy, confused, and troubling part of us\".\n\nAnthony Lane of \"The New Yorker\" wrote: \"At first blush, \"Gone Girl\" is natural Fincherland ... so why doesn't the movie claw us as \"The Social Network\" did? Who could have predicted that a film about murder, betrayal, and deception would be less exciting than a film about a website?\" \"Slant Magazine\"s Ed Gonzalez awarded the film two out of four stars, concluding: \"Fincher and Flynn should have gone further and truly grappled with the real horror that, by giving his relationship with Amy another chance, Nick is indulging in one of the great myths of feminism: that it emasculates men. Rather than undermine that noxiousness, Fincher enshrouds it in funereal brushstrokes that cast his \"Gone Girl\" as a fashionable tumbling into an abyss of willful denial.\"\n\nIn response to some of the criticisms of the film, Flynn said this: \"The whole point is that these are two people pretending to be other people, better people, versions of the dream guy and dream girl, but each one couldn't keep it up, so they destroy each other\".\n\nThe soundtrack was nominated for the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media, and also for the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" was listed on many critics' top ten lists.\n\nIn a 2013 interview with \"Time Out\" writer Novid Parsi, who described the ending of the novel as \"polarizing\", Flynn explained that she wanted the novel to counter the notion that \"women are naturally good\" and to show that women are \"just as violently minded as men are\". In a November 2014 interview, Flynn admitted that the critical gender-related response did affect her: \"I had about 24 hours where I hovered under my covers and was like: 'I killed feminism. Why did I do that? Rats. I did not mean to do that.' And then I very quickly kind of felt comfortable with what I had written.\"\n\nIn an October 3, 2014, blog post for \"Ms. Magazine\", Natalie Wilson argues that by not addressing Amy's social privilege which affords her the \"necessary funds, skills, know-how and spare time\" to stage a disappearance—\"Gone Girl\" is the \"crystallization of a thousand misogynist myths and fears about female behavior.\" Alyssa Rosenberg wrote in \"The Washington Post\" on October 3, 2014, that, although she was initially \"unconvinced\" by the book, her fascination with the novel and film was partly due to her conclusion that \"Amy Elliot Dunne is the only fictional character I can think of who might be accurately described as simultaneously misogynist and misandrist.\"\n\nIn an October 6, 2014, article titled \"\"Gone Girl\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Biggest Villain Is Marriage Itself\", \"Jezebel\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Jessica Coen wrote: \"Movie Amy pales in comparison to the vivid character we meet in the book. Strip away Book Amy's complexities and you're left with little more than 'crazy fucking bitch.' That makes her no less captivating, but it does make the film feel a lot more misogynistic than the novel.\" Coen concedes that this did not negate her enjoyment of the film, \"as we ladies are well accustomed to these injustices.\" \"Time\"s Eliana Dockterman wrote on the same date that \"Gone Girl\" is both \"a sexist portrayal of a crazy woman\" and a \"feminist manifesto\", and that this duality makes the film interesting. Zoë Heller of \"The New York Review of Books\" wrote: \"The problem with Amy is not that she acts in vicious and reprehensible ways, or even that her behavior lends credence to certain misogynist fantasies. The problem is that she isn't really a character, but rather an animation of a not very interesting idea about the female capacity for nastiness\", concluding that \"The film is a piece of silliness, not powerful enough in the end to engender proper 'disapproval': only wonder at its coarseness and perhaps mild dismay at its critical success.\"\n\nWriting in \"The Guardian\" on October 6, 2014, Joan Smith criticized what she saw as the film's \"recycling of rape myths\", citing research released in 2013 which stated that false allegations of rape in the UK were extremely rare. She wrote: \"The characters live in a parallel universe where the immediate reaction to a woman who says she's been assaulted is one of chivalrous concern. Tell that to all the victims, here and in the US, who have had their claims dismissed by sceptical police officers.\" Writing for \"The Guardian\" on the following day, Emine Saner wrote that Smith's argument \"wouldn't carry as much weight were this film set against a vastly wider range of women's stories, and characters in mainstream culture\", but concluded with Dockterman's plea for the portrayal of \"all sorts of women in our novels\".\n\nTim Kroenert, of the Australian website Eureka Street wrote on October 8, 2014, that the film's predominant focus upon Nick's perspective \"serves to obfuscate Amy's motives (though it is possible that she is simply a sociopath), and to amplify her personification of ... anti-women myths\"; however, Kroenert concludes that \"Gone Girl\" is \"a compelling rumination on the impossibility of knowing the mind of another, even within that ostensibly most intimate of relationships, marriage.\"\n\nIn an interview in October 2014, Rosamund Pike stated she would return for a sequel if Gillian Flynn wrote the script. In January 2015, Flynn said she was open to the idea of a sequel, but said it would be \"a few years down the road\" when the original cast and crew would be available again.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1305674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1305674", "title": "Humppa", "text": "Humppa\n\nHumppa is a type of music from Finland. It is related to jazz and very fast foxtrot, played two beats to a bar ( or ). Typical speed is about 220 to 260 beats per minute. Humppa is also the name of a few social dances danced to humppa music. All dances involve bounce that follows the strong bass of the music. In Finnish language, the word humppa can also be used for all social dancing. The name humppa was invented by Antero Alpola for a radio show in the 1950s. He picked it up from German Oktoberfest where the locals used the word to describe the playing of the band. The band probably used a tuba, as the sound of tuba on the first beat is like \"hump\", the second beat coming as a \"pa\". (The related German style is known as oompah.)\n\nThere are three different dances typically danced to humppa music, and they have existed long before the word \"humppa\" was coined. One form of Humppa dance is related to one-step, which arrived in Finland 1913. In this kind of humppa, both dancers take a step on each first beat (on \"hump\") and progress to the direction of dance. This is danced making turns in closed position or making figures by changing various open positions. The second Humppa form is related to two-step, which came to Finland in 1910. This Humppa has some rhythm and movement from samba and waltz. A third form of dance, \"Nilkku\", is based on a slow, slow, quick, quick rhythm. The first quick step hardly takes any weight and gives the dance an appearance of limping.\n\nIn early 1970s pop music and dancing alone almost killed social dancing, but revival of humppa since mid-1970s keeps the traditional social dancing alive.\n\n"}

The film is a reboot of the \"King Kong\" franchise, and serves as the second film in Legendary's MonsterVerse. The film stars Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Brie Larson, Jing Tian, Toby Kebbell, John Ortiz, Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann, Terry Notary, and John C. Reilly.\n\nThe film was announced in July 2014 at San Diego Comic-Con and Vogt-Roberts was announced as the director in September 2014. The project originally began at Universal as an origin story but was later moved to Warner Bros. in order to develop a shared cinematic universe featuring Godzilla and King Kong. Principal photography took place from October 2015 to March 2016 in Hawaii and various locations around Vietnam.\n\n\"Kong: Skull Island\" was released on March 10, 2017, to positive reviews and was a box office success, grossing $168 million domestically and $566 million worldwide. The film was nominated for Best Visual Effects at the 90th Academy Awards. A crossover sequel, \"Godzilla vs. Kong\", is scheduled to be released on May 22, 2020.\n\nIn 1944, two World War II fighter pilots, American pilot Hank Marlow and Japanese pilot Gunpei Ikari, parachute onto an island in the South Pacific after a dogfight and engage in close combat, but the fight is interrupted by a giant ape.\n\nIn 1973, U.S. government agent Bill Randa hires former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad, a skilled tracker, to guide an expedition to map out a recently discovered island known as Skull Island. They are escorted by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard and his subordinates. The group is joined by anti-war photographer Mason Weaver, who believes that the expedition is a secret military operation, and intends to expose it.\n\nArriving at Skull Island, Packard's men begin dropping seismic explosives, developed by Randa's seismologist Houston Brooks, to map out the island and prove Brooks' Hollow Earth theory. However, the air unit is attacked by the same ape from 1944, scattering the survivors across the island. Packard regroups with some survivors, including Randa. After being confronted by Packard, Randa reveals his affiliation with the secret government organization Monarch, and its plan of using the expedition to prove the existence of monsters. Packard's group begins making their way to Major Jack Chapman, Packard's right-hand man, whose helicopter crash-landed elsewhere. Meanwhile, the other group of survivors, led by Conrad, try to reach a rendezvous point to meet a resupply team arriving in three days.\n\nConrad's group eventually encounters the local Iwi natives and an older Marlow. Marlow reveals the ape is Kong, the island's guardian, worshiped as a god by the natives for protecting them from many predators, including two-legged, lizard-like subterranean monsters dubbed \"Skullcrawlers\". He informs them that Kong attacked and destroyed the air unit because their bombs brought them to the surface; the Skullcrawlers are responsible for killing Kong's ancestors, leaving him as the last of his kind. Marlow reveals that he and Ikari became friends, but Ikari was killed by a Skullcrawler some time ago.\n\nAs Chapman is ambushed and devoured by a Skullcrawler, Conrad's group helps Marlow complete a boat built from parts of Marlow and Ikari's downed planes. They ride down the river, and manage to secure communication with Packard's group. They regroup with Packard, who insists on searching for Chapman. Marlow leads them to a mass grave but are attacked by the same Skullcrawler that killed Chapman, killing Randa and others before dying in a flammable gas explosion triggered by Weaver. Learning about Chapman's death, Packard reveals his plan to kill Kong and avenge his fallen men. The group parts ways, with Packard's group retrieving weapons from Chapman's chopper and laying a trap for Kong at a nearby lake, while the non-military personnel head back to the boat.\n\nWhile scouting the path ahead, Conrad and Weaver encounter Kong up close and, seeing his true peaceful nature, they resolve to save him. Packard's group lures Kong with the remaining seismic charges and incapacitates him with ignited napalm. Conrad, Weaver, and Marlow arrive and persuade the other soldiers to spare Kong, but Packard refuses. A massive Skullcrawler emerges from the lake, and Packard is crushed by Kong. The Skullcrawler overpowers Kong but with the humans' help, the ape emerges victorious in the end. Conrad, Weaver, Marlow, and the few survivors reach the rendezvous point and leave the island as Kong sees them leave in his eye.\n\nDuring the credits, Marlow returns home, reuniting with his wife, meeting his son for the first time, and watching a Chicago Cubs game on television. In a post-credits scene, Conrad and Weaver are detained and recruited by Monarch. They are informed by Brooks that Kong is not the only monster king to roam the world and are shown archive footage of cave paintings depicting Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah.\n\n\nAdditionally, Eugene Cordero appears as Reles, a warrant officer of the Sky Devils and Packard's door gunner; Marc Evan Jackson portrays Steve Woodward, a Landsat employee on the expedition; Richard Jenkins portrays Senator Al Willis, a politician who reluctantly funds the expedition; Miyavi portrays Gunpei Ikari, a Japanese World War II pilot who crash-lands on Skull Island alongside Marlow; and Robert Taylor portrays the captain of the \"Athena\". Thomas Middleditch voices Jerry.\n\nOriginally titled \"Skull Island\", the film was announced by Legendary Pictures at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, Universal Pictures was to be the distributor. Legendary then moved the project to Warner Bros. in order to develop a crossover film featuring King Kong and Godzilla.\n\nLegendary offered Joe Cornish the job of directing the film, while Peter Jackson, who directed the 2005 version of \"King Kong\", suggested Guillermo del Toro, who Legendary worked with on \"Pacific Rim\" and \"Crimson Peak\". In September 2014, the studio announced that Jordan Vogt-Roberts would direct the film.\n\nThe script saw a number of screenwriters attached before filming. Seeking the continuity between the King Kong and Godzilla worlds, Max Borenstein (writer of 2014's \"Godzilla\") wrote the first draft, while John Gatins was hired to write the second draft. In writing the script, Borenstein didn't want to repeat the \"Beauty and the Beast\" plot synonymous with \"King Kong\" movies, and took into account the outdated elements of the treatment of the island natives and the damsel in distress. His initial influence was \"Apocalypse Now\", revealing,\n\nBefore Vogt-Roberts signed on as director, Borenstein had the idea of having the film begin during the Vietnam War and jump forward to the present day. After it was rejected, Borenstein instead had the film take place before the original \"King Kong\" film in 1917 during World War I while keeping the \"Apocalypse Now\" concept, and the premise had Tom Hiddleston's character leading a rescue team to Skull Island to find his missing brother, who had gotten stranded there while searching for a \"Titan Serum\" believed to cure all illnesses. After this, the story was again retooled to take place in the present day.\n\nAfter Jordan Vogt-Roberts joined the project, he met with Borenstein and, liking the \"Apocalypse Now\" concept, pitched it to Legendary with the idea of the story taking place at the end of the Vietnam War, which the studio accepted. It was later revealed that Dan Gilroy had also collaborated on the Borenstein/Gatins draft. On August 18, 2015, it was confirmed that Derek Connolly was also doing script rewrites. Borenstein worked a final pass on the screenplay before shooting began, and credited the screenplay to all of the writers, saying, \"It was definitely collaborative in terms of what's on the screen, though none of us worked together. There are pieces of my work in there as well as the work of the other two writers and John Gatins, who was credited for story. Everybody had a really good hand in it.\"\n\nGilroy revealed that many backstories and character moments were dropped from his draft, specifically for the characters of Mason Weaver and James Conrad, feeling that the film had room to explore them. Gilroy disclosed,\n\nDespite these ideas being dropped, Gilroy felt the film turned out to be a \"good movie\" regardless. In April 2016, artist Joe DeVito sued producers of the film for using elements of his Skull Island universe, which he claimed that he created and the producers used without his permission.\n\nThe Visual Effects were done by \"Industrial Light and Magic\", \"Rodeo FX\", Hybride and Shade VFX. \"Industrial Light and Magic\" did the main visuals for Kong. While \"Rodeo FX\" did the Skull Crawler fight scene.\nDirector Vogt-Roberts stated that he wanted Kong to look simple and iconic enough that a third grader could draw him, and the image would still be recognizable. Vogt-Roberts also wanted Kong to feel like a \"lonely god, he was a morose figure, lumbering around this island,\" and took the design back to the 1933 incarnation, where Kong was presented as a \"bipedal creature that walks in an upright position.\" Vogt-Roberts additionally stated, \"If anything, our Kong is meant to be a throwback to the '33 version. [Kong] was a movie monster, so we worked really hard to take some of the elements of the '33 version, some of those exaggerated features, some of those cartoonish and iconic qualities, and then make them their own…We created something that to some degree served as a throwback to the inspiration for what started all of this, but then also [had] it be a fully unique and different creature that — I would like to think — is fully contained and identifiable as the 2017 version of King Kong. I think there are very modern elements to him, yet hopefully, he feels very timeless at the same time.\"\n\nHayao Miyazaki's \"Princess Mononoke\" helped influence the design and approach of the monsters, Vogt-Roberts stated, \"Miyazaki['s] Princess Mononoke was actually a big reference in the way that the spirit creatures sort of have their own domains and fit within that. So a big thing [was] trying to design creatures that felt realistic and could exist in an ecosystem that feels sort of wild and out there, and then also design things that simultaneously felt beautiful and horrifying at the same time.\" However, biophysical analysis of Kong and other creatures concludes that although biophysically they are viable, the ecosystem of the island could not support them.\n\nThe two-armed pit lizard from the 1933 \"King Kong\" film was used as a reference for the Skullcrawlers. They were also inspired by a number of other cinematic creatures; Vogt-Roberts stated, \"That creature, beyond being a reference to a creature from the 1933 film, is also this crazy fusion of all of the influences throughout my life – like the first angel from \"Evangelion\", and No-Face from \"Spirited Away\", and Cubone from \"Pokémon\".\"\n\nAt the same time of the announcement of Vogt-Roberts as director, the studio also announced that Tom Hiddleston would play the lead role. For a time both, J. K. Simmons and Michael Keaton were attached to roles however both left due to scheduling difficulties. On July 23, 2015, Brie Larson was cast in the film to play the female lead. On August 5, 2015, it was announced that Corey Hawkins was cast in the film to play a supporting role. On August 6, 2015, \"Deadline Hollywood\" reported that the studio was in early talks with Samuel L. Jackson to replace the role which Simmons vacated, while John C. Reilly was being eyed for Keaton's role, but not offered it yet. Tom Wilkinson was also offered a role in the film.\n\nOn August 20, 2015, Toby Kebbell joined the cast of the film, while Jackson and Reilly were confirmed for roles. On August 25, 2015, Jason Mitchell joined the cast, to play a pilot. On September 25, 2015, John Goodman was cast to play Randa, a government official and leader of an expedition, and Thomas Mann was also cast. On October 1, 2015, John Ortiz and Shea Whigham were added to the cast in unspecified roles. On October 13, 2015, Eugene Cordero joined the film, and on November 2, 2015, it was announced Will Brittain had joined the cast, portraying a pilot, in one of the last key leads in the film. In May 2016, Toby Kebbell revealed that Terry Notary would portray Kong through motion capture, and that Kebbell provided some guidance for Kong's motion capture sequences.\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on October 19, 2015, and concluded on March 18, 2016. Filming took place in the northern portion of Vietnam, including Tràng An, Vân Long and Tam Cốc (Ninh Bình Province), Hạ Long Bay (Quảng Ninh Province), and at the entrance of Tú Làn Caves System (Tân Hoá, Trung Hoá Village, Minh Hoá District Quảng Bình Province), the island of Oahu in Hawaii, and Australia's Gold Coast. Locations included Honolulu's Chinatown, and at the Kualoa Ranch and Waikane Valley (Ohulehule Forest Conservancy) on Oahu. In mid-January 2016, filming started in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.\n\nVogt-Roberts has cited a number of films that inspired \"Kong: Skull Island\", stating, \"If I were going to break it down for people, I'd say you obviously have \"Apocalypse Now\" and just the era of '70s filmmaking, with films like \"The Conversation\", too. Also \"Platoon\" was an inspiration, and the South Korean film \"The Host\" as well. The entire \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" series was a big influence.\" Vogt-Roberts also cited \"Princess Mononoke\" as an influence on the approach and design of the monsters. He cited Sachiel from \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", Cubone from \"Pokémon\", No-Face from \"Spirited Away\", and a creature from the 1933 \"King Kong\" as inspirations for the Skullcrawlers.\n\nThe score was composed by Henry Jackman. Since the film takes place in the 1970s, Jackman blended '70s psychedelic guitars into the score. \"The great thing about a monster movie is that it opens the door to use the symphony orchestra in its most sumptuous way,\" Jackman says. \"[Director] Jordan [Vogt-Roberts] was happy to celebrate the gravity and history that comes with a full orchestra, but we also explored less traditional elements. That's a field day for a composer.\" The score was recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios together with the London Voices and conducted by Gavin Greenaway, with additional music by Alex Belcher, Halli Cauthery and Stephen Hilton. The soundtrack was digitally released on 3 March 2017 through WaterTower Music.\n\nRegarding the music used in the film, Vogt-Roberts stated, \"I wanted to use songs from the Vietnam era and a myriad of hits from the '70s... [T]his provides a striking dichotomy, sets the tone and gives us great moments of fun. The music, which serves to both heighten the film's emotion and underscore the action, was one of the final creative elements to fall into place during post-production. It was the culmination of a massive undertaking that had taken the production to three continents.\"\n\n\"Kong: Skull Island\" was originally set a release date for November 4, 2016, but in December 2014, the release date was pushed back from its original release date of November 4, 2016, to March 10, 2017. The new release date coincided with the franchise's 84th anniversary. It was released in 3D and IMAX 3D, as well as in Dolby Vision High Dynamic Range, and Dolby Atmos sound in Dolby Cinemas and presented in 70mm. The film premiered at the Cineworld Empire Leicester Square in London on February 28, 2017.\n\n\"Kong: Skull Island\" has grossed $168 million in the United States and Canada and $398.6 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $566.6 million. Made on a production budget of $185 million, with about $136 million more spent on global marketing costs, the film needed to make at least $450–500 million worldwide in order to break even.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"Kong: Skull Island\" was projected to gross $40–50 million in its opening weekend, as well as a worldwide debut of $110–135 million. The film made $20.2 million on its first day from 3,846 theaters, including $3.7 million it made from Thursday night previews. In total, the film earned a better-than-expected $61 million on its opening weekend, defying the film's initial projection by 35%. In IMAX, it made $7.6 million from 382 theaters, repping 12.5% of the film's total opening weekend. In its second weekend the film grossed $27.8 million (a drop of 54.4%), finishing second at the box office behind newcomer \"Beauty and the Beast\".\n\nInternationally, the film debuted with $85.1 million from 20,900 screens in 65 markets. It opened in every market except Japan and China. In IMAX, the film scored the fourth-biggest March release with $4.8 million from 672 theaters (the second biggest without China in it). The biggest openings came from the United Kingdom, Ireland ($7.6 million), South Korea ($7.4 million), Russia ($6.2 million), Mexico ($5.7 million), France ($4.1 million), Taiwan ($3.6 million), Australia ($3.6 million), Brazil ($3.4 million), Germany ($3.4 million), Malaysia ($2.65 million), India ($2.4 million), Spain ($1.6 million) and Italy ($1.6 million), while in Vietnam (where the film was primarily shot and set), it scored the biggest opening of all time there with $2.5 million. This was the week after a huge model of the primate outside the theater caught on fire at the film's premiere. The film would eventually open in China with $71.6 million (its largest international market) and in Japan with $3.5 million, where the film was released as \"King Kong: Giant God of Skull Island\" (\"Kingu Kongu: Dokurotou no Kyoshin\").\nAfter its overseas run, the film would gross internationally.\n\n\"Kong: Skull Island\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 75% based on 335 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Offering exhilarating eye candy, solid acting, and a fast-paced story, \"Kong: Skull Island\" earns its spot in the movie monster's mythos without ever matching up to the classic original.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nMichael Phillips of \"The Chicago Tribune\" lauded the film, giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four: \"I saw little in [Vogt-Roberts'] first feature to indicate the deftness and buoyant spirit he brings to \"Skull Island\". This time, the money's on the screen, but it bought a really good movie, too.\" Mike Ryan of \"Uproxx\" gave the film a positive review, noting, \"\"Kong: Skull Island\" is still a hoot. It was a movie that was not at all on my radar as something I was dying to see and yet I had way too much fun watching it. I just wished it had embraced its craziness just a little bit more. (But, yes, there's still plenty of crazy to go around.)\" Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the film a positive review as well, stating that \"all the requisite elements are served up here in ideal proportion, and the time just flies by, which can rarely be said for films of this nature.\" Kyle Anderson of \"Nerdist News\" found the film entertaining but flawed, saying, \"It's certainly not a perfect movie, and a lot of the characters feel like sketches more than fully-fledged people, but it roars along enjoyably from start to finish.\"\n\nConversely, Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" awarded the film one out of five stars. In his negative review, he described the movie as a \"fantastically muddled and exasperatingly dull quasi-update of the King Kong story.\" Matthew Lickona of \"The San Diego Reader\" also gave the film one out of five stars, writing: \"It's fun to watch [the monsters] in action, but on the human side, the film is clumsily written, over-cast and underacted, with only frustrated soldier Samuel L. Jackson striking the right tone of crazy amid the chaos.\" Chris Klimek of \"NPR\" mentions how \"\"Kong\" is at its mediocre best when it pretends to be a nature documentary about Skull Island's bizarro flora and fauna,\" but lamented how \"every time the movie threatens to get interesting, one of its hordes of ersatz, non-animated characters shows up and starts talking again.\" Anthony Lane of \"The New Yorker\" noted that what the film \"yearns to be, is a pop-culture \"Apocalypse Now\", with the human foe removed, the political parable toned down, and the gonzo elements jacked up.\" J.R. Jones questioned the film's setting, saying \"this \"Jurassic Park\" knockoff takes place neither in the Depression era, which gave us the original \"King Kong\", nor in the present, when satellite photos would surely alert us to the existence of a 100-foot gorilla. Instead—and for no reason I can fathom, except perhaps the classic-rock tunes desired for the soundtrack—the story takes place in 1973, when the Vietnam war is winding down and President Nixon is being driven from office.\"\n\nSeveral critics have commented on Larson's role in the movie, as she had recently won an Academy Award for \"Room\", with Michael Salfino of \"The Wall Street Journal\" remarking that \"a starring role in a popcorn movie on the heels of a passion project can open up an actor to ridicule.\"\n\n\"Kong: Skull Island\" was released on HD Digital on June 20, 2017, and on 4K Ultra HD, 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on July 18, 2017. The film debuted at the top of the NPD VideoScan First Alert sales chart and the dedicated Blu-ray chart for the week ending on July 23, 2017. To date, \"Kong: Skull Island\" sold $42.7 million worth of DVDs and Blu-rays in North America.\n\nIn September 2015, Legendary moved \"Kong: Skull Island\" from Universal to Warner Bros., which sparked media speculation that Godzilla and King Kong will appear in a film together. In October 2015, Legendary confirmed that they would unite Godzilla and King Kong in \"Godzilla vs. Kong\", set for a release date of May 29, 2020. Legendary plans to create a shared cinematic franchise \"centered around Monarch\" that \"brings together Godzilla and Legendary's King Kong in an ecosystem of other giant super-species, both classic and new.\"\n\nDirector Jordan Vogt-Roberts had expressed interest in doing a film about Marlow and Gunpei's time on the island, stating, \"I keep joking that personally I'm more interested in doing a $30 million version of young John C. Reilly on the island. Just some weird, the odd-ball monster comedy with him and Gunpei.\"\n\n\"Godzilla vs. Kong\" is scheduled to be released on May 29, 2020, with Adam Wingard attached to direct the film.\n\n"}

Leased access airtime may be purchased on specialty channels by individuals or groups with E&O insurance for the purposes of airing television programming content, usually local programming.\n\nThe prices for leased access are subject to a maximum set by an FCC formula and therefore in theory cannot be manipulated by cable companies. Cable companies, however, can \"manipulate\" prices through lobbying the FCC. Indeed, in 1997, the FCC set maximum prices based on an \"average implicit fee\" formula which set the prices considered by cable programmers to be very high. Lower prices would likely encourage increased usage of leased access by independent programmers.\n\nLeased access is different from Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels, in that producers pay a fee to have a program on a leased access channel, as opposed to time on a public-access television channel, which is free or at minimum cost. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1536806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1536806", "title": "Lisa's First Word", "text": "Lisa's First Word\n\n\"Lisa's First Word\" is the tenth episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> fourth season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on December 3, 1992. In the episode, as the Simpson family gathers around Maggie and tries to encourage her to say her first word, Marge reminisces and tells the story of Lisa's first word. Elizabeth Taylor appeared for the voicing of Maggie's first word.\n\nThe episode was directed by Mark Kirkland and written by Jeff Martin. After its initial airing on Fox, the episode was later released as part of a 1999 video collection: \"The Simpsons: Greatest Hits\", and released again on the 2003 DVD edition of the same collection. The episode features cultural references to two chains of fast food restaurants, Wendy's and McDonald's, as well as a reference to the 1981 arcade video game \"Ms. Pac-Man\". \"Lisa's First Word\" received positive reception from television critics, and acquired a Nielsen rating of 16.6.\n\nThe Simpson family are trying unsuccessfully to get Maggie to speak, inspiring Marge to share the story of Lisa's first word.\n\nThe story flashes back to March 1983 where Homer, Marge and Bart originally lived in an apartment on the Lower East Side of Springfield. Homer and Marge had to cope with Bart, who was two years old at the time. Marge reveals to her husband and their son that she is pregnant again, and points out to Homer that they will probably need a bigger place. After viewing several unsuitable properties, they buy a house on Evergreen Terrace with a $15,000 down payment from the sale of Grampa's house.\n\nIn 1984, the Simpsons move into their new home and meet their new neighbours, Ned Flanders and his family. Meanwhile, Krusty the Clown begins a promotion for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games with his Krusty Burger chain. The promotion is a scratch-off game where customers could win free Krusty Burgers if America wins a gold medal, but the game cards all feature events that \"Communists never lose\". However, Krusty receives word of the Soviet boycott of the Olympics and that he stands to lose $44,000,000 from all the free burgers he will have to give away. \n\nBart is forced to give up his crib so it can be used for the new baby. Homer builds him a new bed shaped like a clown, which terrifies Bart. When Lisa is born and gets all the attention, Bart takes an immediate dislike to her. Eventually, he is about to run away until Lisa says her first word, \"Bart\". Thrilled that his name is his sister's first word, Marge explains to Bart that Lisa adores him. He accepts her as his little sister and they both find it funny that they each call Homer by his name, rather than \"daddy\" as he wishes.\n\nBack in the present day, Homer takes Maggie to bed, commenting on how the sooner kids learn to talk, the sooner they learn to talk back, and tells Maggie that he hopes she never says a word. But as soon as he turns off the light and closes the door, Maggie takes her pacifier out of her mouth and utters the word \"daddy\", before going to sleep.\n\n\"Lisa's First Word\" was written by Jeff Martin, and directed by Mark Kirkland. \"The Simpsons\" writers Mike Reiss and Al Jean were discussing about having an episode where Maggie would say her first word, and Reiss thought it would be cute to have her say \"daddy\" when no one could hear her. Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, \"I Married Marge\". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought it was fun to check out old newspapers and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of things to make jokes about.\n\nIn the episode, Homer builds a scary clown-shaped bed for Bart. The scene was inspired by Mike Reiss, whose dad had built him a clown-shaped bed when he was younger, and just like Bart, Reiss was scared of sleeping in it. As the flashback begins in 1983, a young Homer strolls down the street, singing Cyndi Lauper's song \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\", which was released the same year. The idea for this sequence came from animation director Chuck Sheetz, who suggested it because the length of the final version of the episode was too short. The Fox censors wrote a note concerning Homer's line, \"Bart can kiss my hairy, yellow butt!\" after Marge tells Homer that Bart might be jealous of baby Lisa, citing that the line is considered \"coarse\", due to the fact that Bart was two during the flashback.\n\nMaggie's first word was provided by the Academy Award-winning actress Elizabeth Taylor, who would also voice herself in the season four finale, \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\". While promoting the episode, the producers initially did not reveal who the voice of Maggie would be, prompting speculation as to the identity of the actress. Although it was only one word, the voice came out \"too sexy\" and Taylor had to record the part numerous times before the producers were satisfied and thought it sounded like a baby. Several sources, including John Ortved's \"The Simpsons\" history article \"Simpsons Family Values\" in \"Vanity Fair\", have reported that after Taylor had been made to repeatedly record the line, she said \"fuck you\" to series creator Matt Groening and stormed out of the studio. Groening recounted this event on a 1994 appearance on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", and was also quoted by the \"New York Daily News\" in 2007 as saying \"We did 24 takes, but they were always too sexual. Finally Liz said, 'F— you,' and walked out.\" However, Groening later denied the story in the DVD commentary for the episode \"Gump Roast\", while Jean stated in a piece after Taylor's death in 2011 that Taylor had said \"fuck you\" in jest and in Maggie's voice and did not storm out.\n\nThe \"Springfield Shopper\" headline from the day Lisa was born (\"Mondale to Hart: Where's the beef?\") uses the then-current advertising slogan for Wendy's. Mondale, a candidate in the 1984 presidential election, used the \"Where's the beef?\" phrase at an election rally in 1984 while mocking one of his opponents. Marge begins telling her story of Lisa's first word by saying: \"This story begins in the unforgettable spring of 1983. Ms. Pac-man struck a blow for women's rights and a young Joe Piscopo taught us how to laugh\", making references to the 1981 arcade video game \"Ms. Pac-Man\" and the American actor Joe Piscopo. The episode features an \"Itchy & Scratchy\" cartoon called \"100-Yard Gash\", which uses the music from the 1981 film \"Chariots of Fire\".\n\nThe Olympic promotion by Krusty Burger is loosely based on a similar \"scratch-and-win\" promotion by McDonald's, in which McDonald's visitors could win a Big Mac, french fries, a drink, or even a cash prize up to $10,000 if Team USA won a medal in the visitor's listed event. McDonald's lost millions on the promotion due to the 1984 Summer Olympics boycott by the Soviet Union, as happened to Krusty. At one point in the episode, Dr. Hibbert refers to Olympic gymnastic medalist Mary Lou Retton.\n\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Lisa's First Word\" was watched by 28.6 million viewers, the most-watched episode of the season. It finished thirteenth in the ratings for the week of November 30 to December 6, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 16.6. The episode was the highest-rated show on Fox that week. It acquired the highest national Nielsen rating of the show since the season two episode \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\" aired on October 11, 1990. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics.\n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", said the episode is a \"convincing portrait of young marriage and hardship in the days of Reaganomics—and the biggest name to guest voice gets the littlest, but the most significant, to say\". When asked to pick his favorite season out of \"The Simpsons\" seasons one through twenty, Paul Lane of the \"Niagara Gazette\" picked season four and highlighted \"the sweetly funny\" \"Lisa's First Word\". David Johnson at DVD Verdict named it \"one of the greatest flashback episodes\". Dave Manley at DVDActive said in a review of \"The Simpsons: Greatest Hits\" DVD that it is \"one of the better episodes and probably my personal favourite on the disc, although most Simpsons connoisseurs would probably go for the previous episode [on the DVD]\", and added that there are \"some great parodies in the episode too\". The \"Orlando Sentinel\"s Gregory Hardy named it the fourteenth best episode of the show with a sports theme (the Olympics in this case).\n\nElizabeth Taylor's performance as Maggie was praised by critics. She was named the 13th greatest guest spot in the history of the show by IGN. Taylor also appeared on AOL's list of their favorite 25 \"Simpsons\" guest stars. Todd Everett at \"Variety\" called the last scene in the episode, where Maggie speaks her first word, \"quite a heart-melter\". He added that \"it is probably no surprise that the casting of Elizabeth Taylor as the voice for baby Maggie Simpson's first word was a publicity stunt [...] No mind, the episode in question delivered well-rounded view of series' multiple attractions.\" \"Total Film\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Nathan Ditum ranked her performance as the best guest appearance in the show's history. Fox rebroadcast the episode on April 3, 2011 in memory of Taylor, following her death on March 23.\n\nInspired by an event in \"The Simpsons\" writer Mike Reiss' childhood, young Bart does not want to give up sleeping in the crib to make way for his newborn sister. Noticing Bart's affection for Krusty the Clown but unable to afford a professionally built Krusty-themed bed, Homer decides to build a bed with Krusty's likeness to please his son. However, because of Homer's poor handicraft skills, the bed takes on an ominous appearance and frightens Bart, especially in the darkened room. In his first night in the new bed, far from \"laughing himself to sleep\", Bart imagines that the face on the headboard of the bed comes to life, intoning with evil glee, \"if you should die before you wake...\", before collapsing into evil cackling.\n\nThe next morning, Bart is curled up into the fetal position on the floor next to the sofa downstairs, repeatedly uttering the phrase \"can't sleep, clown will eat me...\" The catchphrase inspired the Alice Cooper song \"Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me\" from the 2001 album \"Dragontown\". The phrase has since found its way into popular use.\n\n\"Lisa's First Word\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 3, 1992. The episode was selected for release in a 1999 video collection of selected episodes titled: \"The Simpsons: Greatest Hits\". Other episodes included in the collection set were \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\", \"Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song\", \"Trash of the Titans\", and \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\". It was included in \"The Simpsons\" season 4 DVD set, which was released on June 15, 2004 as \"The Simpsons — The Complete Fourth Season\". The episode was again included in the 2003 DVD release of the \"Greatest Hits\" set, but this time the set did not include \"Trash of the Titans\".\n\n"}

Nowadays there is only one toy manufacturer left - \"МИР\"/\"MIR\" (from the communist era) to \"МИКРО\" / \"MIKRO\" a.k.a. \"МИКРО'67\" / \"MIKRO'67\" (post-communist era). Nowadays both the Mikro and Mikro'67 names are used interchangeably.\n\n\"In 1952 in one of the workshops of TPK (producers' co-operative society) Metalik differentiated team of workers for toys manufacturing. With a great effort and ambition the first toy was handmade - a wind-up chain tractor. The production list was growing - trucks, dumpers, diggers, a cannon, a car, a rocket and more. The volume of the production was growing, the number of the workers was growing and these were factors for the creation of a new independent factory.\n\nIn 1.1.1967 was established and independent producers' co-operative society for toys manufacturing with chairman Petar Petrov. A question has arisen - how to name the new manufacturer? With a number of opinions and suggestions, the most adequate of them was \"Peace\", because the peace is joy and carefree childhood for the children all over the world.\n\nIn 1971 the workers moved into a new building. Introducing of new technologies has begun. Typical for that time were the battery-operated toys - machine gun, telephone, SAU tank and more. The range of toys got wider.\n\nAn excitement for the workers was the changing the name from TPK Mir to Mir factory in 1.7.1971 and becoming a part of DSO Mladost, a part of Committee for Youth and Sport and later - a part from the Ministry of Light industry.\n\nThe adoption of new series of Tonka (USA) toys has begun. The production list grew up to 40 different toys. The unification of parts and products started. And yet another joy for the workers - for the first time the company logo crossed the Bulgarian border and toys were exported in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Cuba, Albania, Jordan. Almost 80% of the production was exported.\n\nOn August 1, 1980 the Mir factory name was changed to Mir Youth factory.\nA turning point in the development came in 1983 - topyl printing, assembling the toy boxes with PVX glue, moulding, plastic parts metalling.\n\nAlso in 1983 was adopted a licensed technology of the English company Matchbox for toy making using the moulding method. 5 different casts were made and 8 more in 1984.\nIn 1984 the toys from the MUKPO series were awarded with gold medal at the International Fair in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The toys from the HOBBY series were evaluated with the highest rank for \"K\" quality.\n\nThe range of toys was growing continuously.\nIn November 1986 was formed a workers team for manufacturing of ski automates - licensed from the West Germany company Marker\".\nAfter making a deal with the Matchbox company in 1983 the factory initiated the production of the first five Matchbox \"Superfast\" models and the first few \"Superking\" models. The paint on all the models bearing pearl colors was not very durable, although this condition was later improved. The wheels sets were imported. Today it is very hard to find mint condition models from that time—even in Bulgaria. Up until 1989, 17 \"Superfast\" models and 7 Superkings models were introduced. Although all of the models had minor variations, they were essentially alike. Importantly, there was one primary condition for leasing the dies to the Bulgarian manufacturer - all the models produced were intended to be sold only to the Bulgarian market—with no export. Around 100 000-150 000 pieces of each casting were made. Additionally, after using the new dies, the factory was expected to return them.\n\nIn 1991, after the Cold War had ended, production began on the \"second wave\" of \"Superfast\" models. In the beginning there were again limited variations, but some of the early editions have the decals and the colors of the original models. After a few years business relations soured between the Matchbox company and their Bulgarian partner. It seemed that after opening the borders, many of these Bulgarian models were sold abroad and some were very popular. The Matchbox company eventually broke the contract with Mikro, but they were unable get back the dies for some models. The results of this split are that the nowadays Mattel doesn't recognize Bulgarian models as authentic Matchbox and second - the explosion of thousands of new variations by color, tampos and wheels.\n\nAt the end of the 90's Mukro'67 began offering advertising graphics on their models. Customers who wanted to personalize cars with a name, brand or a graphic could get a manufacturing deal for customized Bulgarian Matchbox models. There was a condition - the customer must order 100 pieces or more although the models may be different. This marketing tool was used by local companies to promote products targeting kids and youngsters and other companies related to auto care and auto parts. International Matchbox and other diecast models clubs also got some limited edition models for their members on special events. The quality of the models has slowly degraded. This and the uniform production list for more than 15 years, the higher prices and other issues are factors for the lower production nowadays. From time to time after running out of parts some new wheels variations appear - sometimes even Matchbox wheels get on a non-Matchbox models and vice versa.\n\nIn 1985 parallel with the Matchbox models, production began on the Gama models. The first 1–2 years they were all kit models for assembling and available in only one color—pearl grass green. Later they started making the regular factory assembled models. Some Gama models are still in production.\n\nIn 1994 Mikro started making Gama/Schuco models for the German market. In the first few years of production they were unavailable on the Bulgarian market, but a limited number of models that didn't meet the German criteria for quality slipped from the factory and got into the hands of local collectors. Mikro was making mainly \"Opel\" models, although there were few \"BMW\" models and \"Mercedes Vito\", promotional models and construction and other vehicles. The models were made and boxed in cheap boxes, exported to Germany where they were then transferred into their original Schuco boxes. Unlike the Matchbox models, none of the Gama or Schuco models have a sign on the base plate \"Made in Bulgaria\". In fact some of them even have the \"Made in Germany\" or \"Made in W. Germany\" insignia. Perhaps one of the reasons for this is that the country of manufacture could affect sales because some collectors consider that the German or Chinese editions would have better quality.\n\nMikro'67 made and still make some pressed steel Buddy L, Clover and Tonka toys. Between 2004 and 2008 were made 5 NZG diecast models.\n\nOnly one diecast model is actually 100% designed and made in Bulgaria. A few models were based on Yaxon, Kidco, and Unimax models.\n\nThe Mikro'67 website www.mikro67.com is fairly updated and doesn't target the diecast models. Product/model catalogs never have been issued to customers or collectors, and there are only two known editions of brochures ( A4 size sheets) one from the 80's and one from 1991 intended for merchants or given to potential customers at toy and industrial fairs.\n\nMore information and pictures may be found on www.bulgariancollection.com - a reference site for Bulgarian diecast models.\n"}

{"id": "46680201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46680201", "title": "Multiverse (Stephen King)", "text": "Multiverse (Stephen King)\n\nMany of the novels and short stories written or co-written by Stephen King take place in a multiverse created by the author.\n\nIn the beginning, there was a magical presence known as the Prim—also referred as the \"darkness behind everything\"–from which Gan arose. When All-World was created, Gan appeared in metaphysical form as a giant edifice known as the Dark Tower, alongside six Beams, which are protected by twelve Guardians.\n\nIt is said that one of the Guardians, Maturin the Turtle, vomited out a universe as the result of a stomach ache. This universe includes the Keystone Earth, which is a reflection of the \"real world\" and also includes a fictional version of Stephen King himself. It is the universe of the Rose too.\n\nSome people have the ability to travel between universes by \"going Todash\"; other ways are through rare artifacts like the Wizard's Rainbow, the Talisman, and the Lil Pink.\n\nGan uses Stephen King as a facilitator to tell the tale of the Gunslinger, so Roland Deschain could successfully go about his task of reaching the Tower. If the author died before completing his task, Roland would not have \"known\" how to further proceed on his quest to the Tower and, without any significant remaining opposition, the Crimson King would have finally toppled the Dark Tower and initiated \"Discordia\"—the event which all universes would have ceased to exist—and there would be no story created.\n\n\"Ka\" is a plot element in Stephen King's \"Dark Tower\" series. It is a word of the fictional language High Speech.\n\nIn the books, it is a mysterious force that leads all living (and unliving) creatures. It is the will of Gan, the approximate equivalent of destiny or fate, in King's fictional language of High Speech. \"Ka\" can be considered to be a guide, a destination, but is certainly not a plan—at least, not one that is known to mortals. Ka is not necessarily a force of good or evil; it manipulates both sides, and seems to have no definite morality of its own. To this end, Ka resonates with the concept of karma.\n\nBecause of the importance of \"ka\" to the world of King's \"Dark Tower\", many phrases in the High Speech use the word ka, such as:\n\n\nA \"ka-tet\" is a group of beings brought together by \"ka\". \"We are \"ka-tet\". We are one from many,\" says Roland Deschain on the day before the Battle of Algul Siento. \"Ka-tet\" is the belief that a group of people can be tied together by fate, or \"ka\". It is said that a group has shared \"khef\" or the water of life. Sometimes the symbol of water is used literally, as in a ritual Roland and his \"ka-tet\" performs the night before the battle of Algul Siento. In the seventh novel, Susannah Dean, who ends up understanding ka maybe more than Roland himself, comes to the understanding that in simple terms, \"ka-tet\" means family.\n\nRoland's \"ka-tet\" includes himself, Eddie Dean, Susannah Dean, Oy, and Jake Chambers. Roland's previous \"ka-tet\" included himself, Cuthbert Allgood, Jamie De Curry, and Alain Johns.\n\n\"Ka\" is mentioned in some of King's other books, including \"Hearts in Atlantis\", \"Desperation\" and \"Insomnia\". The characters James Eric Gardener in \"The Tommyknockers\" and Rosie McClendon in \"Rose Madder\" also ponder about \"ka\". It is mentioned in \"The Stand\" by Judge Farris when he observes a crow outside his window that he believes is Randall Flagg shortly before he is killed by Flagg's men. However, in this context it appears that \"ka\" refers to the Egyptian word for life force.\n\nThe \"ka-tet\" concept has been frequently used by King, even in books that do not use the terms \"ka\" or \"ka-tet\", such as \"It\", \"The Stand\", \"Desperation\", \"Insomnia\", \"Dreamcatcher\", and \"Duma Key\". This may be compared to Kurt Vonnegut's \"karass\".\n\nThe Random and the Purpose are concepts elaborating the \"grammar\" of All-World introduced in \"Insomnia\". The Purpose and the Random are driving forces on the different levels (worlds or realities) the Dark Tower connects. There are even stronger forms like the Higher Purpose and the Higher Random. It is not totally clear whether these higher forms are multiple individual beings sharing a common aim, or if they are underlying forces not bound to personal forms. Both Purpose and Random have so-called agents, middlemen between ordinary human beings (\"Short-Timers\") and the god-like All-Timers. Clotho and Lachesis are agents of the Purpose, while Atropos is an agent of the Random. Central is the idea that Purpose and Random need to be in balance.\n\nFor each field exist higher beings which seem to be god-like. While arguably Gan or Maturin would belong to the Higher Purpose , the Crimson King or It are beings of the Higher Random .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "888313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=888313", "title": "Nancy (comic strip)", "text": "Nancy (comic strip)\n\nNancy is an American comic strip, originally written and drawn by Ernie Bushmiller and distributed by United Feature Syndicate. The character of Nancy, a precocious eight-year-old, first appeared in the strip \"Fritzi Ritz\" about the airheaded flapper title character. Larry Whittington began \"Fritzi Ritz\" in 1922, and it was taken over by Bushmiller three years later.\n\nOn January 2, 1933, Bushmiller introduced Fritzi's niece, Nancy. Soon she dominated the daily strip, which was retitled \"Nancy\" in 1938; Sluggo Smith, Nancy's friend from the \"wrong side of the tracks\" had been introduced earlier that year, and the strip's popularity soared. Fritzi Ritz devolved to a secondary character, and her boyfriend, Phil Fumble, eventually disappeared altogether. Comics historian Don Markstein ascribed the strip's success to Bushmiller's \"bold, clear art style, combined with his ability to construct a type of gag that appealed to a very broad audience.\n\nPhil Fumble made a reappearance in the November 27, 2012, strip, and became a regular character as of early January 2013, with the intention of furthering his relationship with Aunt Fritzi.\n\n\"Fritzi Ritz\" continued as a Sunday feature until 1968. At its peak in the 1970s, \"Nancy\" ran in more than 880 newspapers, before falling to 79 shortly before Gilchrist's retirement.\n\nAl Plastino worked on Sunday episodes of \"Nancy\" in 1982–1983 after Bushmiller died. During that period, David Letterman showed on TV a \"Nancy\" panel with Plastino's signature and made a joke about Plastino as a superhero name. (Letterman's writers were apparently unaware that Plastino was known for his superheroes.)\n\nThe strip has continued to the present day by different writers and artists. Mark Lasky briefly handled the strip in 1983 until his death from cancer at age 29. The strip was handed to Jerry Scott in 1984, who gradually started to draw the strip in a much different, more modern style than other incarnations. In 1994, the syndicate began seeking a replacement for Scott; applicants included Ivan Brunetti and Gary Hallgren. In 1995, Guy and Brad Gilchrist were given control of the strip, returning the artwork to its traditional style; Guy Gilchrist subsequently became the sole author and illustrator.\n\nOn January 2, 2018, Gilchrist announced that after 22 years, his last \"Nancy\" strip would be February 18, 2018, which involved the marriage between the characters of Fritzi Ritz and Phil Fumble. \n\nFollowing a two-month hiatus, the strip resumed on April 9 with \"21st-century female perspective\" from a person using the pen name Olivia Jaimes, the strip's first-ever female author. 75 newspapers still ran the strip. Jaimes said, \"Nancy has been my favorite sassy grouch for a long time. I’m excited to be sassy and grouchy through her voice instead of just mine\" and \"the Nancy I know and love is a total jerk and also gluttonous and also has big feelings and voraciously consumes her world\". Tom Spurgeon described Jaimes as funny and talented, with an approach to the character that both breaks with and pays homage to Bushmiller's version.\n\nJaimes updated the strip's technology, having Nancy frequently use her smartphone, and learn robotics. The September 3rd, 2018 strip spawned an internet meme; it featured Nancy riding a hoverboard, using a phone, wielding a selfie stick, and proclaiming \"Sluggo is lit\". Jaimes described her aim with that strip to \"most upset the person who likes me the least... somebody who’s like,'Nancy sucks now'... what I imagine my greatest hater would despise most is Nancy interacting with every piece of technology using words you don’t understand.\"\n\nBushmiller refined and simplified his drawing style over the years to create a uniquely stylized comic world. \"The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\" illustrates its entry on \"comic strip\" with a \"Nancy\" cartoon. Despite the small size of the reproduction, both the art and the gag are clear, and an eye-tracking survey once determined that \"Nancy\" was so conspicuous that it was the first strip most people viewed on a newspaper comics page.\n\nIn a 1988 essay, \"How to Read Nancy\", Mark Newgarden and Paul Karasik offered a probing analysis of Bushmiller's strip:\nComics theorist Scott McCloud described the essence of Nancy:\nCartoonist Wally Wood described \"Nancy\"&apos;s design more succinctly: \"By the time you decided not to read it, you already had.\"\n\n\nBushmiller won the National Cartoonists Society's Humor Comic Strip Award for 1961 and the Society's Reuben Award for Best Cartoonist of the Year in 1976.\n\nIn 1995, the strip was selected as one of the 20 in the \"Comic Strip Classics\" series of commemorative U.S. postage stamps.\n\nThere were first several Fritzi Ritz comic stories in comics published by United Feature. These include \"Fritzi Ritz\" No. 1 (1948), 3–7 (1949), #27–36 (1953–1954); \"United Comics\" #8–36 (1950–1953); \"Tip Topper Comics\" #1–28 (1949–1954); St John published \"Fritzi Ritz\" #37–55 (1955–1957). Dell published \"Fitzi Ritz\" #56–59 (1957–1958)\n\nNancy appeared in comic books—initially in a 1940s comic strip reprint title from United Feature, later St. John Publications and later in a Dell comic written by John Stanley. Titled \"Nancy and Sluggo\", United Feature published #16–23 (1949–1954), St. John published #121–145 (1955–1957). Titled \"Nancy\", until retitled \"Nancy and Sluggo\" with issue #174, Dell published #146–187 (1957–1962). (Hy Eisman produced some of Dell's Nancy stories in 1960-61. Gold Key published #188–192 (1962–1963). Dell also published \"Dell Giants\" devoted to Nancy (#35, No. 45 and \"Traveltime\"), and a \"Four Color\" #1034. Nancy and Sluggo also appeared in stories in \"Tip Top Comics\" published by United Feature (#1–188), St. Johns (#189–210), and Dell (#211–225), \"Sparkler\" #1–120 (1941–1954) and \"Sparkle\" #1–33 (1953–1954) published by United Feature. Fritzi Ritz and Nancy appeared in several \"Comics on Parade\" (#32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 55, 57, 60–104) published by United Feature.\n\n\"Nancy\" was reprinted in the UK comic book, \"The Topper\", from the 1950s through the 1970s. \"Nancy\" also had its own monthly comic book magazine of newspaper reprints in Norway (where the strip is known as \"Trulte\") during 1956–1959.\n\nNancy was featured in two animated shorts by the Terrytoons studio in 1942–1943: \"School Daze\" and \"Doing Their Bit\". In 1971, several newly created Nancy and Sluggo cartoons appeared on the Saturday morning cartoon series, \"Archie's TV Funnies\", which starred the Archie Comic Series characters running a television station. Nancy appeared along with seven other comic strip characters: Emmy Lou, Broom-Hilda, Dick Tracy, The Dropouts, Moon Mullins, the Captain and the Kids and Smokey Stover. The series lasted one season. In 1978, she was also featured in several segments of Filmation's animated show \"Fabulous Funnies\", a repackaging of Archie's TV Funnies material minus the Archie characters wraparounds.\n\nNancy has been translated into foreign languages. In French, Nancy is called Philomène in Canada, and Zoé in France, where the strip is called \"Arthur et Zoé\" (Arthur being the French name of Sluggo). The Philomène strip appeared in Canadian French-language newspapers on January 16, 2006. Nancy also appeared on the back cover of the popular Arabic children magazine Majid during the 80s, she was known as Moza while Sluggo was portrayed as her brother Rashoud.\nBushmiller's art work has inspired other artists:\n\n\n\n\n\nA spin-off titled \"Random Acts of Nancy\" began March 19, 2014, consisting of sampled single panels of \"Nancy\" comics drawn by Ernie Bushmiller. Following Guy Gilchrist's departure from \"Nancy\", this strip was discontinued.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "188735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188735", "title": "Portnoy's Complaint", "text": "Portnoy's Complaint\n\nPortnoy's Complaint is a 1969 American novel by Philip Roth. Its success turned Roth into a major celebrity, sparking a storm of controversy over its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality, including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver. The novel tells the humorous monologue of \"a lust-ridden, mother-addicted young Jewish bachelor,\" who confesses to his psychoanalyst in \"intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language.\" Many of its characteristics (such as comedic prose, themes of sexual desire and sexual frustration, and a self-conscious literariness) went on to become Roth trademarks.\n\nIn 1998, the Modern Library ranked \"Portnoy's Complaint\" 52nd on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. \"Time\" included this novel in its \"\"TIME\" 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005.\"\n\nStructurally, \"Portnoy's Complaint\" is a continuous monologue by narrator Alexander Portnoy to his psychoanalyst, Dr. Spielvogel; Roth later explained that the artistic choice to frame the story as a psychoanalytic session was motivated by \"the permissive conventions of the patient-analyst situation,\" which would \"permit me to bring into my fiction the sort of intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language that [...] in another fictional environment would have struck me as pornographic, exhibitionistic, and nothing but obscene.\"\n\nThe novel is set primarily in New Jersey from the 1940s to the 1960s. Portnoy is \"a lust-ridden, mother addicted young Jewish bachelor\", and the narration weaves through time describing scenes from each stage of his life; every recollection in some way touches upon his central dilemma: his inability to enjoy the fruits of his sexual adventures even as his extreme libidinal urges force him to seek release in ever more creative (and, in his mind, degrading and shameful) acts of eroticism; also, much of his dilemma is that \"his sense of himself, his past, and his ridiculous destiny is so \"fixed\".\" Roth is not subtle about defining this as the main theme of his book. On the first page of the novel, one finds this clinical definition of \"Portnoy's Complaint\", as if taken from a manual on sexual dysfunction:\n\nThe title also alludes to the common literary form of \"complaint,\" such as \"A Lover's Complaint\", which typically presents the speaker's comments on being a spurned lover.\n\nOther topics touched on in the book include the assimilation experiences of American Jews, their relationship to the Jews of Israel, and the pleasures and perils the narrator sees as inherent in being the son of a Jewish family.\n\n\"Portnoy's Complaint\" is also emblematic of the times during which it was published. Most obviously, the book's sexual frankness was both a product of and a reflection on the sexual revolution that was in full swing during the late 1960s. And the book's narrative style, a huge departure from the stately, semi-Jamesian prose of Roth's earlier novels, has often been likened to the stand-up performances of 1960s comedian Lenny Bruce.\n\nThe novel is notable for its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality, including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver which Portnoy's mother later serves for dinner.\n\nRoth had begun work on \"Portnoy's Complaint\" in 1967, before publication of his novel \"When She Was Good\" that year. The piece had its genesis in a satirical monologue Roth had written to accompany a slide show proposed for inclusion in the risqué revue \"Oh! Calcutta!\" that would focus on the sexual organs of the rich and famous.\n\nWhile the slide show would never come to fruition, Roth found part of the accompanying monologue about masturbation salvageable. Roth re-fashioned the material for the novel and sold a chapter of the book, entitled \"Whacking Off\", to \"Partisan Review\". Progress on the novel was slow because Roth was suffering from writer's block relating to his ex-wife, Margaret Martinson, and the unpleasant notion that any royalties generated by the novel would have to be split equally with her. In May 1968 Martinson was killed in a car crash in Central Park. Roth's writer's block lifted and following Martinson's funeral he traveled to the Yaddo literary retreat to complete the manuscript.\n\nThe publication of the novel caused a major controversy in American public discourse. The two aspects that evoked such outrage were its explicit and candid treatment about sexuality and obscenities, including detailed depiction of masturbation, which was revolutionary in the late 1960s; and the irreverent portrait of Jewish identity. It sparked an uproar in the Jewish community, even among New York intellectuals such as Irving Howe and Diana Trilling.\n\nIn 1969 the book was declared a \"prohibited import\" in Australia. The Australian publisher, Penguin Books, circumvented the importation ban by having copies printed in Sydney in secret and stored in fleets of moving trucks to avoid seizure under state obscenity laws. A 1967 agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and its states had put in place a uniform censorship effort against books on the federal banned books list. According to this agreement, books that were imported into the country would be handled by the Commonwealth, while the states would police local publication and distribution, using state laws to prosecute. However, South Australia bucked the system when it came to \"Portnoy's Complaint\", declaring that it would not prosecute sales of the work made to an adult who made a direct enquiry of the vendor, provided the books were kept behind the counter.\n\nAttempts to prosecute Penguin and any bookseller carrying the book were successful in Victoria and Queensland, but failed in Western Australia (where \"works of recognised artistic, scientific or literary merit\" were immune under the local statute, notwithstanding that they may have been obscene) and New South Wales, where prosecutors gave up after two trials resulted in hung juries. The book was removed from the federal banned list for importation in June 1971, the federal government recognising the absurdity that local publications could be sold legally in three states and the Australian Capital Territory. The \"Portnoy\" matter was a watershed in Australian censorship law, marking the last occasion on which the censorship of a literary publication came before the courts.\n\nMany libraries in the United States banned the book because of its detailed discussion of masturbation and its explicit language.\n\nThe popularity of the novel has caused the title to become a sort of shorthand for any form of sexual malaise or activity. In his autobiography, Dick Cavett wrote that on one occasion when a male guest was unable to appear on his talk show, Cavett jokingly told the studio audience the guest could not attend because he was \"\"suffering from Portnoy's Complaint\", a comment which the network censors decided to cut from the broadcast tape. Gore Vidal once quipped to Claire Bloom, Roth's second wife: \"You have already had Portnoy's complaint [her previous husband]. Do not involve yourself with Portnoy\".\"\n\nOn the 8 September 2010, episode of \"The Daily Show\", as part of an extended segment on the amount of violence in major religious texts, Jon Stewart and John Oliver have a debate wherein Stewart claims the book as the main text of Judaism, in response to Oliver's demand of a disavowal regarding the violence depicted in portions of Hebrew sacred texts.\n\nIn her metafictional novel \"Culture Shock\" (Duckworth 1988), Valerie Grosvenor Myer wrote of a satirically presented married couple among her characters:Let us consider my Jean and Jack ... I weighted the scales by presenting them in the rôle of parents ... fictional parents are usually set up as Aunt Sallies to be knocked down ... Mrs. Bennet, Mrs. Nickleby, Mrs. Portnoy; Old Capulet, Mr Dorrit, Dr Sloper.\n\nIn the \"Get Smart\" original TV series, in the fifth-season episode \"Do I Hear a Vaults?\", aired on 8 May 1970, Maxwell Smart alludes to the book being hidden in a public library.\n\nThe \"Mad Men\" character Don Draper is briefly shown reading the novel in the season seven episode of the series titled \"The Monolith.\"\n\nOn the TV series \"Californication\", in the episode titled \"Coke Dick and the first kick\", a female writer for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine calls one of Hank Moody's early novels \"the retarded man's \"Portnoy's Complaint\"\".\n\nIn the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Peter, Chris, & Brian\", Brian Griffin makes several references to \"Portnoy's Complaint\", clearly not having read the book and assuming it was about a \"port noise complaint\".\n\nIn the \"Bojack Horseman\" episode \"Ruthie\", Princess Carolyn remarks \"Who knew Portnoy had so many complaints?\" in response to fictional actress Courtney Portnoy.\n\nIn 1972, the novel was adapted into a film written and directed by Ernest Lehman, and starring Richard Benjamin and Karen Black.\n\n\n\n"}

The term is primarily used with FM stations, and mainly in North America. The name derives not from the sound of a rimshot in music, but rather from basketball, where the ball hits the rim of the basket, and may or may not go in.\n\nRimshot stations are often at a disadvantage compared to higher-strength signals in a market. Many rimshot operators attempt to serve the larger market with a signal that has deficiencies in the intended listening area, especially on the far side from where it is transmitted.\n\nMany (if not most) rimshot stations are move-ins, having moved to about halfway between their city of license (which they are legally required to cover and serve) and the metro area which they actually care about. In this manner, the broadcast range of the station ideally covers both. Although stations have traditionally been required to keep their main studio in their community of license, this has become less and less meaningful as more and more have been granted waivers to consolidate radio studios at a single location due to concentration of media ownership.\n\nIn the U.S., it was FCC MM docket 80-90 that allowed FM stations to have closer spacing, thereby allowing move-ins, and some new stations as well. This has generally been allowed, especially when it makes room for additional stations in outlying areas. In these cases, the table of allotments is amended in a rulemaking proceeding, although this is not always a requirement to move a station in most cases, depending on each particular situation.\n\nOn an international level, stations which attempt to serve another country are called \"border blasters\". These are primarily Mexican AM stations operating at very high power on clear channels to reach the American Southwest and beyond via skywave at night.\n\nIn Canada, the CRTC restricts most same-market duopolies in television to channels broadcasting in different languages. Hence, English-language duopolies in major Canadian markets have involved stations licensed to rimshot major cities or serve different portions of a larger metropolitan area (such as Victoria for Vancouver, Hamilton and Barrie for Toronto, and Pembroke for Ottawa).\n"}

In instances where the supervillain does not have superhuman, mystical, or alien powers, the supervillain may possess a genius intellect or a skill set that allows them to draft complex schemes or commit crimes in a way normal humans cannot. Other traits may include megalomania and possession of considerable resources to further their aims.

He was the elder half-brother of Sir Charlie Chaplin and served as his business manager, and was the a half-uncle of the actor Sydney Chaplin (1926–2009), who was named after him.\n\nChaplin was born to 19-year-old Hannah Hill in London. Hannah claimed Sydney's father was a man named Sydney Hawkes, but his father's identity was never verified. The Chaplin surname was adopted following his mother's marriage to Charles Chaplin, Sr., a year after his birth. \n\nWhile Syd and brother Charlie were in the Cuckoo Schools in Hanwell following his mother's mental collapse, Syd was placed in the programme designed to train young boys to become seamen, on the Exmouth training ship docked at Grays, Essex. He followed this training period with several years working on ships, receiving high marks from all of his employers. But his ambition was to get into the entertainment business and he left his final voyage with that in mind.\n\nIn 1905 Charlie and Sydney worked briefly together in one of their first stage appearances, \"Sherlock Holmes\". Syd was briefly cast as a villain in that play. In 1906 however, he landed a contract with Fred Karno, of Karno's London Comedians and was to fight hard to bring Charlie into the company two years later. Charlie never achieved the sort of fame Syd did as a principal comedian for that company, but that was to be the only time that Syd was able to outdo his brother—at least in front of an audience.\n\nAfter Charlie achieved worldwide fame in the 1910s, the brothers discovered they had another half-brother through their mother, Wheeler Dryden, who had been removed from his mother's care as an infant and brought up abroad by his father. Wheeler was also an actor, and the brothers reunited in Hollywood in 1918, occasionally working together at Chaplin's studio through to the 1950s.\n\nAs Charlie was negotiating his Keystone contract, he suggested Sydney be asked to join the company, and Syd and his wife Minnie Chaplin arrived in California in October 1914. Syd made a few comedies there, including the \"Gussle\" comedies, and the comedy short \"A Submarine Pirate\" in 1915, which, second to \"Tillie's Punctured Romance,\" was the most financially successful comedy Keystone ever made.\n\nFollowing this success, Sydney decided to leave the screen to negotiate Charlie a better contract. After getting him a $500,000 contract with Mutual on 27 February 1916, he got him his first million dollar ($1.25 million) contract on 17 June 1917 with First National. Soon he was handling the majority of Charlie's business affairs, including a failed sheet music business and a successful merchandising one, in addition to further contract negotiation. He also appeared in a few films during the First National era, such as \"Pay Day\" and \"The Pilgrim\". Sydney achieved his own million-dollar contract from Famous Players-Lasky in 1919, but a series of problems resulted in only one failed film, \"King, Queen, Joker\" (1921), disappearing from the screen once again. Later films include \"The Perfect Flapper\" (1924) with Colleen Moore, \"A Christie Comedy\", \"Charley's Aunt\" (1925) and five features for Warner Bros. Pictures, including \"The Man on the Box\" (1925), \"Oh, What a Nurse!\" (1926), \"The Missing Link\" (1927), \"The Fortune Hunter\" (1927), and \"The Better 'Ole\" (1926). The last is perhaps his best-known film today because of his characterisation of cartoonist Bruce Bairnsfather's famous World War I character, Old Bill, and the fact that it was the second Warner Bros. film to have a Vitaphone soundtrack. It is also believed by many to have the first spoken word of dialogue, \"coffee\", although there are those who disagree.\n\nSydney's first film for British International Pictures (BIP), \"A Little Bit of Fluff\" (1928), proved to be his final film. In 1929, just as he was to begin work on a second film for the studio, \"Mumming Birds\", he was accused of biting off the nipple of actress Molly Wright in a sexual assault. BIP settled out of court, conceding the truth of Wright's claims. Following the scandal, he left England, leaving a string of unpaid tax demands. By 1930 he was declared bankrupt.\n\nIn addition to his importance in launching and promoting brother Charlie's career over the years, perhaps Chaplin's most important contribution to history is in the field of aviation. In May 1919, he, along with pilot Emery Rogers, formulated the first privately owned domestic American airline, the Syd Chaplin Airline Company, based in Santa Monica, California. Even though the corporation lasted only a year, in that time it accumulated many \"firsts.\" Syd and partners had the first ever aeroplane showroom for their Curtiss aeroplanes. Emery Rogers conducted the first roundtrip Los Angeles to San Francisco flight in one 24-hour period. Charlie Chaplin took his first-ever aeroplane flight in one of Syd's planes, as did many other notable personages of the period. Chaplin got out of the aviation business right after legislation began to pass regarding pilot licensing and the taxation of planes and flights.\n\nChaplin married twice and had no children. His first wife, Minnie, died in France in September 1936 following surgery for breast cancer. After World War II, Sydney lived most of his final years in Europe. His second wife, Henriette (called Gypsy) survived him. After a long illness, he died one month after his 80th birthday, on 16 April 1965, in Nice, France. Chaplin is buried beside his wife Gypsy in Clarens-Montreux Cemetery, near Vevey.\n\nSydney was portrayed both as a teenager by actor Nicholas Gatt and as an adult by actor Paul Rhys in Richard Attenborough's \"Chaplin\", depicting his personal and professional relationship with Charlie.\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

The company also owns the Jets' minor league affiliate, the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League. Aside from hockey, TNSE is also involved in real estate with True North Square and are active in bringing high-profile concerts and entertainment acts to Winnipeg.\n\nTNSE was founded in 2001 by Manitoba Moose co-owner Mark Chipman and several local investors. Their goal was to build a new entertainment and sports venue in downtown Winnipeg to help revive the city's downtown area and possibly one day bring an NHL franchise back to Winnipeg following the departure of the original Winnipeg Jets franchise to Phoenix, Arizona in 1996. Ownership of the Moose was transferred to TNSE in 2003.\n\nThe 15,321-seat Bell MTS Place (formerly the MTS Centre) was completed in fall 2004 and became the new home of the Moose, replacing the Winnipeg Arena. The arena was built at a cost of $133.5 million on land acquired from Osmington Incorporated, a real estate firm owned by Toronto billionaire David Thomson. In exchange for the land, Osmington took a minority share in TNSE. Chipman and Thomson, through their respective holding companies, now have complete ownership of TNSE.\n\nIn summer 2010, TNSE opened the MTS Iceplex, an arena and training complex located on the western edge of Winnipeg. The Iceplex features four ice surfaces and is used by several amateur teams, local minor hockey, and recreational leagues. It also serves as the practice facility for the Winnipeg Jets and Manitoba Moose.\n\nTNSE realized its goal of landing an NHL franchise in May 2011, when it purchased the struggling Atlanta Thrashers, subsequently relocating the club to Winnipeg and renaming it the Winnipeg Jets. As a result, the Moose were relocated to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador for the 2011–12 season and rebranded as the St. John's IceCaps, and became the top minor league affiliate of the Jets. Although the IceCaps were successful both on and off the ice, TNSE opted to return the club back to Winnipeg for the 2015-16 season. The second incarnation of the Manitoba Moose now share the MTS Centre with their NHL parent club and are one of only two AHL teams to have this arrangement.\n\nIn January 2007, Chipman was invited to meet with NHL executives, including commissioner Gary Bettman, in New York to make a presentation about bringing an NHL team to Winnipeg, either through expansion or relocation. TNSE wasn't alone—the NHL also met with interested parties from Houston, Kansas City, Seattle, and Las Vegas—but were most impressed by the presentation from the Winnipeg group.\n\nIn 2009, Bettman approached Chipman about the possibility of taking over the struggling Phoenix Coyotes. The Coyotes were on the verge of declaring bankruptcy and were purchased by the league out of bankruptcy court later that year. In October, Chipman made a second presentation to the league about relocating a team to Winnipeg. The Coyotes ownership issue remained unresolved in May 2010. As the league was not prepared to cover the team's losses for another season, the league executive reached a tentative agreement to sell the Coyotes to TNSE, allowing them to relocate the franchise back to Winnipeg. This was intended as a back-up plan, as the league's first choice was to keep the team in Arizona. With no other investors in place, the league asked the City of Glendale to cover the Coyotes losses for the 2010–11 season. Facing a tight deadline, city council voted in favor of the deal rather than risk losing the primary tenant of their arena. According to Chipman, TNSE came \"within ten minutes of acquiring (the Coyotes)\".\n\nAfter a failed bid to sell the team to Matthew Hulziser, the NHL and TNSE resumed their negotiations in spring of 2011. Glendale city council decided to cover the teams losses for another year, so TNSE shifted their focus on another opportunity—to acquire the Atlanta Thrashers from the Atlanta Spirit group. On the morning of May 31, 2011, the sale was finalized and announced at a press conference held at the MTS Centre. The sale and relocation of the team to Winnipeg was approved by the NHL Board of Governors on June 21. Mark Chipman confirmed that the team would be known as the Jets at the 2011 NHL Entry Draft on June 24. The Jets played their inaugural game on October 9, 2011 in front of a sold-out crowd at the MTS Centre, losing 5–1 against the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nAlthough the Jets did not qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs in their first season, the team was very successful off the ice. It was widely believed that the Jets, playing in the league's smallest market, would require assistance through the NHL's revenue sharing program to be financially viable. However, the team's revenues in 2011–2012 exceeded expectations to the extent that they did not qualify. According to Forbes' 2012 NHL financial report, the Jets generated $105 million US in revenue during their inaugural season, 16th best in the league, and posted operating income of $13.3 million. According to Forbes' 2013 report, the value of the franchise doubled within two years of TNSE's acquisition in 2011. \nIn an interesting quirk, when the lyric \"True North strong and free\" in O Canada is sung prior to Jets home games and some games when the Jets are the visiting team, fans commonly yell the \"True North\" portion. Presumably, this is a nod to the ownership group which brought the NHL back to Winnipeg.\n\nTrue North Square is a plaza under construction in downtown Winnipeg. It is a joint venture between TNSE and James Richardson & Sons and is being constructed at the site of the former Carlton Inn hotel, which True North purchased in June 2015 following months of negotiations with the city. The heart of the project is a two-acre public park which will include green space and a public stage. Construction of the public portion of the plaza which will be partially funded by the provincial and city governments as will connecting the buildings to the Winnipeg Walkway.\n\nThe remainder of the plaza will include four mixed-used towers being constructed adjacent to the park, which will house a luxury hotel, office and retail space, and residential units. The towers, estimated at a cost of $400 million, are planned for completion in 2019.\n\nThe Burton Cummings Theatre for the Performing Arts is a 1,600-seat former vaudeville theatre-turned-music venue in downtown Winnipeg. TNSE assumed management of the venue in 2014 through a lease agreement with the not-for-profit theatre's board of directors. Under this arrangement, TNSE also commenced with badly needed repairs and upgrades to the building. In 2016, TNSE exercised its option to purchase the building.\n\nThe MTS Centre Exhibition Hall was an exhibition centre operated by TNSE from 2010 to 2011. It was located in the now-demolished A&B Sound building across the street from the MTS Centre and hosted three exhibits during its existence. The first show, the controversial , ran from September 2010 to January 2011. Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition, produced by RMS Titanic Inc., ran from February to July 2011. It featured close to 200 of the over 5,500 collected artifacts from the doomed ocean liner. The final show, Da Vinci the Genius ran from August to November 2011.\n\nThe True North Youth Foundation, formerly the Manitoba Moose Yearling Foundation, is a non-profit organization created by TNSE. The foundation raises funds for charitable causes and also runs its own projects: a children's summer camp, a youth hockey school, and \"Project 11\", which promotes mental wellness in schools and youth groups. \"Project 11\", led by TNSE senior vice-president Craig Heisinger, was created in response to the death of Rick Rypien, a former Moose player who suffered from severe depression.\n\n"}
{"id": "169660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169660", "title": "Ultimate Fighting Championship", "text": "Ultimate Fighting Championship\n\nThe Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is an American mixed martial arts promotion company based in Las Vegas, Nevada, that is owned and operated by parent company William Morris Endeavor. It is the largest MMA promotion company in the world and features the highest-level fighters on the roster. The UFC produces events worldwide that showcase twelve weight divisions and abide by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. As of 2018, the UFC has held over 400 events. Dana White serves as the president of the UFC. White has held that position since 2001; while under his stewardship, the UFC has grown into a globally popular multi-billion-dollar enterprise.\n\nThe first event was held in 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado. The purpose of the early Ultimate Fighting Championship competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a contest with minimal rules and no weight classes between competitors of different fighting disciplines like boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, sambo, wrestling, Muay Thai, karate, and judo. In subsequent events, fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create an entirely separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts. In 2016, UFC's parent company, Zuffa, was sold to a group led by William Morris Endeavor (WME–IMG) for $4.025 billion.\n\nWith a TV deal and expansion in Australia, Asia, Europe and new markets within the United States, the UFC has increased in popularity, and has achieved greater mainstream media coverage; the promotion brought in a total revenue of US$609 million in 2015, and its next domestic media rights agreement with ESPN was valued at $1.5 billion over a five-year term.\n\nArt Davie proposed to John Milius and Rorion Gracie an eight-man single-elimination tournament called \"War of the Worlds\". The tournament was inspired by the Gracies in Action video-series produced by the Gracie family of Brazil which featured Gracie jiu-jitsu students defeating martial-arts masters of various disciplines such as karate, kung fu, and kickboxing. The tournament would also feature martial artists from different disciplines facing each other in no-holds-barred combat to determine the best martial art and would aim to replicate the excitement of the matches Davie saw on the videos. Milius, a noted film director and screenwriter, as well as a Gracie student, agreed to act as the event's creative director. Davie drafted the business plan and twenty-eight investors contributed the initial capital to start WOW Promotions with the intent to develop the tournament into a television franchise.\n\nIn 1993, WOW Promotions sought a television partner and approached pay-per-view producers TVKO (HBO) and SET (Showtime), as well as Campbell McLaren and David Isaacs at the Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG). Both TVKO and SET declined, but SEG – a pioneer in pay-per-view television which had produced such offbeat events as a gender versus gender tennis match between Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova – became WOW's partner in May 1993.\nSEG contacted video and film art director Jason Cusson to design the trademarked \"Octagon\", a signature piece for the event. Cusson remained the Production Designer through \"UFC 27\". SEG devised the name for the show as \"The Ultimate Fighting Championship\".\n\nWOW Promotions and SEG produced the first event, later called \"UFC 1\", at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado on November 12, 1993. Art Davie functioned as the show's booker and matchmaker. The show proposed to find an answer for sports fans' questions such as: \"Can a wrestler beat a boxer?\" As with most martial arts at the time, fighters typically had skills in just one discipline and had little experience against opponents with different skills. The television broadcast featured kickboxers Patrick Smith and Kevin Rosier, savate fighter Gerard Gordeau, karate expert Zane Frazier, shootfighter Ken Shamrock, sumo wrestler Teila Tuli, boxer Art Jimmerson, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt Royce Gracie—younger brother of UFC co-founder Rorion, whom Rorion handpicked to represent his family in the competition. Royce Gracie's submission skills proved the most effective in the inaugural tournament, earning him the first ever UFC tournament championship after submitting Jimmerson, Shamrock, and Gordeau in succession. The show proved extremely successful with 86,592 television subscribers on pay-per-view.\n\nIt's disputed whether the promoters intended for the event to become a precursor to a series of future events. \"That show was only supposed to be a one-off\", eventual UFC president Dana White said. \"It did so well on pay-per-view they decided to do another, and another. Never in a million years did these guys think they were creating a sport.\" Art Davie, in his 2014 book \"Is This Legal?\", an account of the creation of the first UFC event, disputes the perception that the UFC was seen by WOW Promotions and SEG as a one-off, since SEG offered a five-year joint development deal to WOW. He says, \"Clearly, both Campbell and Meyrowitz shared my unwavering belief that War of the Worlds would be a continuing series of fighting tournaments—a franchise, rather than a one-night stand.\"\n\nWith no weight classes, fighters often faced significantly larger or taller opponents. Keith \"The Giant Killer\" Hackney faced Emmanuel Yarbrough at \"UFC 3\" with a height and weight disadvantage. Many martial artists believed that technique could overcome these size disadvantages, and that a skilled fighter could use an opponent's size and strength against him. With the Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned Royce Gracie, Ken Shamrock, and Patrick Smith, the competitions also featured competitors such as Hall of Famer Dan Severn, Marco Ruas, Gary Goodridge, Don Frye, Kimo Leopoldo, Oleg Taktarov, and Tank Abbott. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then ground and pound, kickboxing, boxing, and dirty boxing, which eventually melded into modern mixed martial arts.\n\nIn April 1995, following \"UFC 5\" in Charlotte, North Carolina, Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, headbutting, groin strikes, and fish-hooking.\n\nIn a \"UFC 4\" qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and Guy Mezger agreed not to pull hair—as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between Keith Hackney and Joe Son in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the \"UFC 5\" broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.\n\n\"UFC 5\" also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face; it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by \"UFC Brazil\", the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time \"UFC Japan\" tournament featuring Japanese fighters). \"UFC 6\" was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, Ken Shamrock.\n\nThe violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.\n\nIn 1996, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent. McCain himself led a campaign to ban UFC, calling it \"human cockfighting\", even sending letters to the governors of all fifty US states asking them to ban the event.\n\nThirty-six states enacted laws that banned \"no-hold-barred\" fighting, including New York, which enacted the ban on the eve of \"UFC 12\", forcing a relocation of the event to Dothan, Alabama. The UFC continued to air on DirecTV PPV, though its audience remained minuscule compared to the larger cable pay-per-view platforms of the era.\n\nIn response to the criticism, the UFC increased cooperation with state athletic commissions and redesigned its rules to remove the less palatable elements of fights while retaining the core elements of striking and grappling. \"UFC 12\" saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of fish-hooking. For \"UFC 14\", gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. \"UFC 15\" saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes. With five-minute rounds introduced at \"UFC 21\", the UFC gradually re-branded itself as a sport rather than a spectacle.\n\nLed by UFC commissioner Jeff Blatnick and referee John McCarthy, the UFC continued to work with state athletic commissions. Blatnick, McCarthy, and matchmaker Joe Silva created a manual of policies, procedures, codes of conduct, and rules to help in getting the UFC sanctioned by the athletic commissions, many of which exist to this day. Blatnick and McCarthy traveled around the country, educating regulators and changing perceptions about a sport that was thought to be bloodthirsty and inhumane. By April 2000, their movement had clearly made an impact. California was set to become the first state in the U.S. to sign off on a set of codified rules that governed MMA. Soon after, New Jersey adopted the language.\n\nAs the UFC continued to work with the athletic commissions, events took place in smaller U.S. markets, and venues, such as the Lake Charles Civic Center. The markets included states that are largely rural and less known for holding professional sporting events, such as Iowa, Mississippi, Louisiana, Wyoming, and Alabama. SEG could not secure home-video releases for \"UFC 23\" through \"UFC 29\". With other mixed martial arts promotions working towards U.S. sanctioning, the International Fighting Championships (IFC) secured the first U.S. sanctioned mixed-martial-arts event, which occurred in New Jersey on September 30, 2000. Just two months later, the UFC held its first sanctioned event, \"UFC 28\", under the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board's \"Unified Rules\".\n\nAs the UFC's rules started to evolve, so too did its field of competitors. Notable UFC fighters to emerge in this era include Hall of Famers Mark Coleman, Randy Couture, Pat Miletich, Chuck Liddell, Matt Hughes, and Tito Ortiz, as well as notables Vitor Belfort, Mark Kerr, Pedro Rizzo, Murilo Bustamante, Frank Shamrock, Mikey Burnett, Jeremy Horn, Pete Williams, Jens Pulver, Evan Tanner, Andrei Arlovski, and Wanderlei Silva, among others.\n\nAfter the long battle to secure sanctioning, SEG stood on the brink of bankruptcy, when Station Casinos executives Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta and their business partner Dana White approached them in 2000, with an offer to purchase the UFC. A month later, in January 2001, the Fertittas bought the UFC for $2 million and created Zuffa, LLC as the parent entity controlling the UFC.\n\n\"I had my attorneys tell me that I was crazy because I wasn't buying anything. I was paying $2 million and they were saying 'What are you getting? Lorenzo Fertitta revealed to \"Fighter's Only\" magazine, recalling the lack of assets he acquired in the purchase. \"And I said 'What you don't understand is I'm getting the most valuable thing that I could possibly have, which is those three letters: UFC. That is what's going to make this thing work. Everybody knows that brand, whether they like it or they don't like it, they react to it.\n\nWith ties to the Nevada State Athletic Commission (Lorenzo Fertitta was a former member of the NSAC), Zuffa secured sanctioning in Nevada in 2001. Shortly thereafter, the UFC returned to pay-per-view cable television with UFC 33 featuring three championship bouts.\n\nThe UFC slowly, but steadily, rose in popularity after the Zuffa purchase, due partly to greater advertising, corporate sponsorship, the return to cable pay-per-view and subsequent home video and DVD releases.\n\nWith larger live gates at casino venues like the Trump Taj Mahal and the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the UFC secured its first television deal with Fox Sports Net. \"The Best Damn Sports Show Period\" aired the first mixed martial arts match on American cable television in June 2002, as well as the main event showcasing Chuck Liddell vs. Vitor Belfort at \"UFC 37.5\". Later, FSN would air highlight shows from the UFC, featuring one-hour blocks of the UFC's greatest bouts.\n\"UFC 40\" proved to be the most critical event to date in the Zuffa era. The event was a near sellout of 13,022 at the MGM Grand Arena and sold 150,000 pay per view buys, a rate roughly double that of the previous Zuffa events. The event featured a card headlined by a highly anticipated championship grudge match between then-current UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz and former UFC Superfight Champion Ken Shamrock, who had previously left to professional wrestling in the WWE before returning to MMA. It was the first time the UFC hit such a high mark since being forced \"underground\" in 1997. \"UFC 40\" also garnered mainstream attention from massive media outlets such as ESPN and \"USA Today\", something that was unfathomable for mixed martial arts at that point in time. Many have suggested that the success of \"UFC 40\" and the anticipation for Ortiz vs. Shamrock saved the UFC from bankruptcy; the buyrates of the previous Zuffa shows averaged a mere 45,000 buys per event and the company was suffering deep monetary losses. The success of \"UFC 40\" provided a glimmer of hope for the UFC and kept alive the hope that mixed martial arts could become big. Beyond the rivalry itself, the success of UFC 40 was due in part to the marketing and outreach power of crossover athletes - from Pro Wrestling to MMA and MMA to Pro Wrestling - a practice with roots in Japan's Pride Fighting Championships. Long time UFC referee \"Big\" John McCarthy said that he felt UFC 40 was the turning point in whether or not the sport of MMA would survive in America.\n\nDespite the success of \"UFC 40\", the UFC was still experiencing financial deficits. By 2004, Zuffa had $34 million of losses since they purchased the UFC. Fighters who came into prominence after Zuffa's takeover include Anderson Silva, Georges St-Pierre, Rich Franklin, B.J. Penn, Sean Sherk, Matt Serra, Ricco Rodriguez, Robbie Lawler, Frank Mir, Karo Parisyan, and Nick Diaz.\n\nFaced with the prospect of folding, the UFC stepped outside the bounds of pay-per-view and made a foray into television. After being featured in a reality television series, \"American Casino\", and seeing how well the series worked as a promotion vehicle, the Fertitta brothers developed the idea of the UFC having its own reality series.\n\nTheir idea, \"The Ultimate Fighter\" (\"TUF\") was –a reality television show featuring up-and-coming MMA fighters in competition for a six-figure UFC contract, with fighters eliminated from competition via exhibition mixed martial arts matches. It was pitched to several networks, each one rejecting the idea outright. Not until they approached Spike TV, with an offer to pay the $10 million production costs themselves, did they find an outlet.\n\nIn January 2005, Spike TV launched \"The Ultimate Fighter 1\" in the timeslot following \"WWE Raw.\" The show became an instant success, culminating with a notable season finale brawl featuring light heavyweight finalists Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonnar going toe-to-toe for the right to earn the six-figure contract. The live broadcast of the season finale drew a very impressive 1.9 overall rating. Dana White credits \"TUF 1\" for saving the UFC.\n\nOn the heels of the Griffin/Bonnar finale, a second season of \"The Ultimate Fighter\" launched in August 2005, and two more seasons appeared in 2006. Spike and the UFC continued to create and air new seasons until the show moved to FX in 2012.\n\nFollowing the success of \"The Ultimate Fighter\", Spike also picked up \"UFC Unleashed\", an hour-long weekly show featuring select fights from previous events. Spike also signed on to broadcast live \"UFC Fight Night\", a series of fight events debuting in August 2005, and \"Countdown\" specials to promote upcoming UFC pay-per-view cards.\n\nAfter a very successful run on Spike and with the upcoming announcement of the UFC's new relationship with Fox, Spike officials made a statement regarding the end of their partnership with the UFC, \"\"The Ultimate Fighter\" season 14 in September will be our last... Our 6-year partnership with the UFC has been incredibly beneficial in building both our brands, and we wish them all the best in the future.\"\n\nWith the announcement of UFC's partnership with Fox in August 2011, \"The Ultimate Fighter\", which entered its 14th season in that September, moved to the FX network to air on Friday nights starting with season 15 in the Spring of 2012. Along with the network change, episodes are now edited and broadcast within a week of recording instead of a several-month delay, and elimination fights are aired live.\n\nWith increased visibility, the UFC's pay-per-view buy numbers exploded. \"UFC 52\", the first event after the first season of \"The Ultimate Fighter\" featuring eventual-UFC Hall of Famer Chuck \"The Iceman\" Liddell avenging his defeat to fellow eventual-Hall of Famer Randy Couture, drew a pay-per-view audience of 300,000, doubling its previous benchmark of 150,000 set at \"UFC 40\". Following the second season of \"The Ultimate Fighter\", the UFC's much-hyped match between Liddell and Couture drew an estimated 410,000 pay-per-view buys at \"UFC 57\".\n\nFor the rest of 2006, pay-per-view buy rates continued to skyrocket, with 620,000 buys for \"UFC 60: Hughes vs. Gracie\"—featuring Royce Gracie's first UFC fight in 11 years—and 775,000 buys for \"UFC 61\" featuring the highly anticipated rematch between Ken Shamrock and Tito Ortiz, the coaches of \"The Ultimate Fighter 3\". The organization hit a milestone with \"UFC 66\", pitting Ortiz in a rematch against Liddell with over 1 million buys.\n\nThe surge in popularity prompted the UFC to beef up its executive team. In March 2006, the UFC announced that it had hired Marc Ratner, former Executive Director of the Nevada Athletic Commission, as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. Ratner, once an ally of Senator McCain's campaign against \"no holds barred\" fighting, became a catalyst for the emergence of sanctioned mixed martial arts in the United States. Ratner lobbied numerous athletic commissions to help raise the UFC's media profile in an attempt to legalize mixed martial arts in jurisdictions inside and outside the United States that had yet to sanction the sport.\n\nIn December 2006, Zuffa acquired the northern California-based promotion World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) in order to stop the International Fight League (IFL) from making a deal with Versus (now NBC Sports Network). At the time, the UFC had an exclusive deal with Spike, so the purchase of the WEC allowed Zuffa to block the IFL from Versus without violating their contract. The WEC showcased lighter weight classes in MMA, whereas the UFC featured heavier weight classes. Notable WEC fighters included Urijah Faber, Jamie Varner, Carlos Condit, Benson Henderson, Donald Cerrone, Anthony Pettis, Eddie Wineland, Miguel Angel Torres, Mike Thomas Brown, Leonard Garcia, Brian Bowles, Dominick Cruz, and José Aldo.\n\nIn December 2006, Zuffa also acquired their cross-town, Las Vegas rival World Fighting Alliance (WFA). In acquiring the WFA, they acquired the contracts of notable fighters including Quinton Jackson, Lyoto Machida, and Martin Kampmann.\n\nThe sport's popularity was also noticed by the sports betting community as BodogLife.com, an online gambling site, stated in July 2007 that in 2007 UFC would surpass boxing for the first time in terms of betting revenues. In fact, the UFC had already broken the pay-per-view industry's all-time records for a single year of business, generating over $222,766,000 in revenue in 2006, surpassing both WWE and boxing.\n\nThe UFC continued its rapid rise from near obscurity with Roger Huerta gracing the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" and Chuck Liddell on the front of \"ESPN The Magazine\" in May 2007.\n\nOn March 27, 2007, the UFC and their Japan-based rival the Pride Fighting Championships announced an agreement in which the majority owners of the UFC, Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, would purchase the Pride brand.\n\nInitial intentions were for both organizations to be run separately but aligned together with plans to co-promote cards featuring the champions and top contenders from both organizations. However, after purchasing Pride, Dana White felt that the Pride model was not sustainable and the organization would likely fold with many former Pride fighters such as Antônio Rodrigo \"Minotauro\" Nogueira, Maurício \"Shogun\" Rua, Dan Henderson, Mirko \"Cro Cop\" Filipović, Wanderlei Silva, and others already being realigned under the UFC brand. On October 4, 2007, Pride Worldwide closed its Japanese office, laying off 20 people who were working there since the closing of its parent company Dream Stage Entertainment (DSE).\n\nOn June 18, 2008, Lorenzo Fertitta accommodated the UFC's growth by announcing his resignation from Station Casinos in order to devote his energies to the international business development of Zuffa, particularly the UFC. The move proved to be pivotal, as Fertitta helped strike TV deals in China, France, Mexico, and Germany as well as open alternative revenue streams with a new UFC video game and UFC action figures, among other projects.\n\nFighters exposed to the UFC audience—or who became prominent—in the post-Pride era include Anderson Silva, Jon Fitch, Lyoto Machida, Cain Velasquez, and Jon Jones, among others.\n\nPopularity took another major surge in 2009 with \"UFC 100\" and the 10 events preceding it including \"UFC 90\", \"91\", \"92\", \"94\", and \"98\". \"UFC 100\" was a massive success garnering 1.6 million buys under the drawing power of former NCAA wrestling champion Brock Lesnar and his rematch with former UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir, Canadian Georges St-Pierre going head-to-head with Brazilian Thiago Alves, and American Dan Henderson opposing British Michael Bisping at middleweight after the two were rival coaches on \"\".\n\n\"UFC 100\" was unique in that it drew significant interest from ESPN, which provided extensive coverage of the event in the days preceding and following it. In fact, ESPN would eventually devote additional coverage of the UFC and other MMA news with the television debut of \"MMA Live\" on ESPN2 in May 2010.\n\nThe buzz from \"UFC 100\" was hampered significantly in the second half of 2009 after a rash of injuries and other health-related issues—including Brock Lesnar's life-threatening bout with diverticulitis—forcing the organization to continuously scramble and reshuffle its lineup for several events.\n\nHowever, the momentum gradually began to pick up in the first quarter of 2010 after victories from defending champions Georges St-Pierre and Anderson Silva, as well as Lyoto Machida's first career defeat to \"Shogun\" Rua for the UFC Light Heavyweight title. These fights segued into a very popular clash between former UFC Champions and rivals Rashad Evans and Quinton Jackson—rival coaches on \"\"—at \"UFC 114\", featuring the UFC's first main event headlined by black fighters. The event scored over 1 million pay per view buys as Evans secured a unanimous decision victory.\nThis momentum carried into the summer of 2010 at \"UFC 116\", which featured the return of Brock Lesnar defending his UFC Heavyweight title against the undefeated interim-champion Shane Carwin before 1.25 million PPV viewers. Lesnar survived an early barrage of Carwin's punches in a contest that was nearly stopped by referee Josh Rosenthal. However, Lesnar recovered in the second round to submit Carwin via arm triangle choke to retain the undisputed UFC Heavyweight Championship. The event as a whole was critically acclaimed in the media for living up to the hype with a number of exciting fights that were featured on the televised card.\n\nAfter a dramatic fifth round, last minute victory by UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva over Chael Sonnen at \"UFC 117\", Lesnar finally surrendered his belt to the undefeated Cain Velasquez via 1st-round TKO at \"UFC 121\". The fight produced Velasquez's eighth knockout or technical knockout in his first nine MMA fights.\n\n\"UFC 129\" featured Georges St-Pierre vs. Jake Shields at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and is currently the largest UFC event in North American history, which coincided with a two-day UFC Fan Expo at the Direct Energy Centre. The event sold out 55,000 tickets for gate revenues exceeding $11 million, shattering previous MMA attendance and gate records in North America.\n\nOn November 5, 2016 the UFC had their first exhibition in New York City after years of being delayed by government officials and red tape with a dramatic first match, Conor McGregor vs. Eddie Alvarez.\n\nZuffa, the parent company of the UFC, purchased World Extreme Cagefighting in late 2006 and held the first WEC event under new ownership on January 20, 2007. Soon thereafter the WEC made its home on the Versus Network with its first event debuting on that network in June 2007.\n\nOn October 28, 2010, Zuffa announced that WEC would merge with the UFC. The WEC held its final card on December 16, 2010. As a result of the merger, the UFC absorbed WEC's bantamweight, featherweight and lightweight weight divisions and their respective fighters. The UFC also made the last WEC Featherweight and Bantamweight Champions, José Aldo and Dominick Cruz respectively, the inaugural UFC Champions of their new weight divisions.\n\nReed Harris, who started World Extreme Cagefighting with Scott Adams, had mixed emotions on the merger. \"It's kind of like when your kid goes off to college: at first you're not happy, but after you think about it for a while, you're really happy,\" Harris told MMAWeekly.com in an exclusive interview immediately following the announcement. \"At the end of the day, I never imagined this thing would be where we're at today. I'm extremely proud and happy that I was involved with something that will now be part of what may be, some day, the largest sports organization in the world.\"\n\nOn March 12, 2011, Dana White revealed that Zuffa had purchased Strikeforce. White went on to explain that Strikeforce will operate as an independent promotion, and that Scott Coker will continue to run the promotion. Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker announced the return of Fedor Emelianenko on an unspecified July or August event and said that Zuffa-owned company would continue to co-promote with M-1 Global. Following the purchase, the UFC signed many of Strikeforce's top stars and champions, such as Jason Miller, Nick Diaz, Dan Henderson, Alistair Overeem, and Cung Le. Under Zuffa's ownership, Strikeforce made minor changes, including adopting the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts in full, closing the promotion's men's weight classes below lightweight, and ceasing promotion of amateur undercard bouts. After an extension was reached to continue Strikeforce through 2012, the promotion's heavyweight division (sans Heavyweight Grand Prix finalists) was merged into the UFC, and the promotion's Challengers series was ended.\n\nThe final Strikeforce show was on January 12, 2013, after which the promotion was dissolved and all fighter contracts were either ended or absorbed into the UFC.\n\nOn August 18, 2011, The Ultimate Fighting Championship and Fox announced a seven-year broadcast deal through the Fox Sports subsidiary, effectively ending the UFC's Spike TV and Versus (now NBC Sports Network) partnership. The deal includes four events on the main Fox network, 32 live Friday night fights per year on their cable network FX, 24 events following \"The Ultimate Fighter\" reality show and six separate Fight Night events.\n\nThe promotion's first broadcast television event – – broke form by showcasing only one fight to television viewers. In the main event, Junior dos Santos abruptly dethroned then-undefeated UFC heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez by knock-out at 1:04 in the first round. The telecast peaked with 8.8 million viewers tuning into the fight with an average audience of 5.7 million, making it by far the most watched MMA event of all-time and the most watched combat sports event since 2003's HBO bout between Lennox Lewis and Vitali Klitschko.\n\nOne of the other programming opportunities that emerged was a weekly UFC magazine-style show. When asked about the potential for a weekly magazine-style series, UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta responded, \"Not only weekly, but, potentially, multiple times per week you'll have a UFC magazine (show).\" The UFC maintained production control of its product, including the use of its broadcast team of Mike Goldberg and Joe Rogan. Fox Sports produced the pre- and post-shows.\n\nUFC on Fox 31 is will be held on December 15, 2018 at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States and this event will also mark the end of the UFC and seven years deal with Fox Sports after UFC signed a new broadcast 5 years deal with ESPN is slated to begin in January 2019.\n\nOn November 16, 2012, the eve of UFC 154: St. Pierre vs. Condit, Dana White confirmed with Jim Rome the UFC would feature women's MMA with the signing of its first female fighter, Strikeforce bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey. She subsequently became the first female UFC champion, the first Olympic medalist with a UFC title, and the first woman to defend a UFC title. She would successfully defend her title six times over a grand total of 1,074 days, before she was defeated by Holly Holm on November 15, 2015, at UFC 193.\n\nOn December 11, 2013, the UFC purchased the contracts of 11 female fighters from Invicta Fighting Championships to launch their 115-pound Strawweight division. Eight of the Invicta fighters took part in the 20th season of \"The Ultimate Fighter\", \"\", along with eight additional fighters signed up for the tournament via open tryouts. Season winner, Invicta FC's Strawweight Champion, Carla Esparza became the first UFC women's strawweight champion, defeating Rose Namajunas in the finale. Other fighters on the show included Felice Herrig, Tecia Torres, Bec Hyatt, Randa Markos, Jessica Penne, and Joanna Jędrzejczyk.\n\nThe first UFC event to be held outside the United States was UFC 8 in Puerto Rico, a US territory, in 1996. Subsequently, the UFC has visited 15 countries in Asia, Europe, Oceania, South America, and North America.\n\nCanada has hosted events 18 times, starting with UFC 83 in 2008 and most recently in 2015 with UFC 186. UFC's biggest event to date was also in Canada, as UFC 129 held at Rogers Centre featured a record-breaking attendance of 55,724.\n\nThe United Kingdom has been home to 16 events. The first was UFC 38 held in London in 2002. UFC returned to the United Kingdom in 2007 with UFC 70, and visited Northern Ireland for UFC 72. The UK's most recent event was at England with UFC 204 in 2016. Ireland has held UFC 93 in 2009 and 5 years later. In continental Europe, Germany has hosted 5 times, the first being UFC 99 in 2009, UFC 122 in 2010, in 2014, in 2015 and the latest was in 2016. Sweden has hosted 3 times, starting with in 2012, and recently with in 2015. Poland had its first event with in 2015. There are also Fight Night events due to take place in 2016, in Rotterdam, Netherlands and Zagreb, Croatia.\n\nThe first Brazilian event was UFC Brazil: Ultimate Brazil, held in São Paulo in 1998. The promotion did not return to Brazil until 2011 for UFC 134, but since then, the country has hosted a further 20 events. Their most recent visit was . In 2014, Mexico became the second country in Latin America to host an event with UFC 180, followed by a second event, UFC 188, in 2015.\n\nSeven UFC events have been held in Australia, beginning with UFC 110 in 2010 and most recently in 2015 with UFC 193. New Zealand held its first event in 2014, .\n\nIn Asia, the UFC has visited 5 countries. Japan had its first visit in 1997 for . The UFC only returned to the country in 2012, with UFC 144. Their last visit was in 2014 for , the seventh event there. The promotion has also featured 2 visits to the United Arab Emirates. The first was in 2010 for UFC 112 and the second in 2014 for . The promotion has also visited Macau in 3 occasions: China's special administrative region was first visited in 2012 with and last visited in 2014 for . The promotion has also visited Singapore with in 2014. The Philippines was the most recent Asian country that the UFC has visited, with in 2015.\n\nThe Ultimate Fighter has had international editions as well: Brazil (since 2012), Australia (vs. United Kingdom - 2012), China (2013), Canada (vs. Australia - 2014), and Latin America (2014).\n\nOn February 27, 2014, the Nevada State Athletic Commission banned the use of Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT). The UFC followed suit and banned the use of TRT for any of their events, including international markets where the UFC oversees regulatory efforts.\n\nIn December 2014, an antitrust lawsuit was filed against Zuffa by several fighters, claiming the organization restricts fighters' control over their careers and earning potential.\n\nThroughout 2015, debate over venues and possible case dismissals ensued. Ultimately, the case moved to Nevada federal courts, where Zuffa was denied its motion to stay discovery for 15 years of its financial records.\n\nThis has caused an ongoing debate and struggle over how UFC sensitive information should be handled, and who may view it. Especially concerning MMAFA founder, Rob Maysey who has taken the lead in representing the former athletes and has stated he hopes to achieve reforms similar to the Ali Act (2000).\n\nLater that year, a 12–16 month investigation began that is expected to last until sometime between September 2016 to January 2017. Thus far, both sides have provided well over 100,000 documents.\n\nOn July 1, 2015, the UFC Anti-Doping Program was put into place, ran by the United States Anti-Doping Agency known as \"USADA\" to protect the rights of all clean athletes in the UFC.\n\nIn May 2016, ESPN originally reported that the UFC's parent company Zuffa, LLC was in talks to sell the company for $3.5 billion to $4 billion. (In 2015, the UFC had a reported EBITDA of $200–250 million.) Because it was a privately owned company, no official comment was made from the UFC or Dana White regarding the sale. Companies initially interested in the sale were Dalian Wanda Group, China Media Capital, and WME–IMG (Endeavor).\n\nOn July 9, 2016, it was officially announced that the UFC would be sold to a group led by WME–IMG, its owner Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and MSD Capital, for $4.025 billion. At the time, it marked the largest-ever acquisition in sports. Lorenzo Fertitta stated that the new ownership, \"with whom we've built a strong relationship over the last several years, is committed to accelerating UFC's global growth\", and that they \"share the same vision and passion for this organization and its athletes.\" Flash Entertainment (owned by the government of Abu Dhabi) will retain its 10% minority stake in the company. White, who owned 9% of the UFC, stayed, having been given a stake in the new business. Shortly after the sale, it was announced that White would remain president. As a result of the sale, Fertitta stepped down as chairman and CEO. WME-IMG was renamed Endeavor in September 2017.\n\nIn October 2016, \"MMAJunkie\" obtained an UFC financial report released by Endeavor, detailing that the promotion had reached a year-to-year high of $609 million in revenue during 2015. 76% of the total was credited to \"content\" revenue, covering media rights, PPV buys and UFC Fight Pass subscriptions; in turn, 42% of content revenue was credited to pay-per-view buys, followed by U.S. and international media rights.\n\nIn May 2018, UFC reached new U.S. media rights deals with Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International and ESPN Inc., succeeding those with 21st Century Fox, which begin in January 2019. The five-year contracts are cumulatively valued at $300 million per-year for digital and linear rights, roughly doubling the amount paid by Fox in the final year of its previous contract, and include 42 events on ESPN platforms per-year. ESPN linear networks will televise preliminary cards for UFC PPV events, and 10 \"UFC on ESPN Fight Night\" events per-year. The subscription streaming service ESPN+ will broadcast 20 exclusive events per-year under the branding \"UFC on ESPN+ Fight Night\"; regardless of network, all \"Fight Night\" events will feature a full, 12-fight card, and their preliminaries will air exclusively on ESPN+. The ESPN+ service will also hold on-demand rights to UFC library and archive content, new seasons of \"Dana White's Contender Series\", and other new original content. UFC Fight Pass will be purchasable as an add-on for ESPN+ to stream pay-per-view events.\n\nOn July 18, 2018, it was announced that UFC has entered into a partnership with Russian MMA promoter M-1 Global. M-1 Global will serve as a farm league to scout Russian fighters for UFC and will participate in organizing UFC events in Russia. The deal also gives M-1 champions the opportunity to sign with UFC. On September 15, 2018, the first UFC event in Russia was held at the Olympic Stadium in Moscow.\n\nUFC Anti-Doping Program was launched in June 2015, \nOn June 3, 2015, UFC announced join partnership with United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) on anti-doping program \n\nOn September 28, 2018, it was reported that UFC and USADA grant the UFC's fighters time to go through adjudication process before an announcement is made with the results of the potential doping violation after several cases of fighters such as Anderson Silva,Junior dos Santos, Josh Barnett and Cris Cyborg were flagged for potential doping violations but clear from punishment after they were proved of unintentional use of performance enhancing drugs (usually in the form of contaminated supplement).\n\nThe current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board. The set of \"Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard \"de facto\" set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes. Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with UFC 138 on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning. Today Zuffa reserves exclusive use of the name \"The Octagon\".\n\nThe UFC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl. The standard octagon has a diameter of with a high fence. The cage sits atop a platform, raising it from the ground. It has foam padding around the top of the fence and between each of the eight sections. It also has two entry-exit gates opposite each other. The mat, painted with sponsorship logos and art, is replaced for each event.\n\nFor smaller venues and events, the UFC often uses a smaller cage, which is only across.\n\nAll competitors fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Tops are only approved for female competitors. Required safety equipment include padded gloves, mouthguard, and protective cups held in place with a jockstrap for males. The open-fingered gloves have at least 1\" of padding around the knuckles, (110 to 170 g / 4 to 6 ounces) that allow fingers to grab. To ensure compliance, fighters are checked by a State Athletic Committee official before being allowed to enter the cage/ring.\n\nOriginally the attire for UFC was very open. Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion Royce Gracie wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while Art Jimmerson appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove. As of UFC 133 there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after Dennis Hallman wore one in his fight against Brian Ebersole. UFC president Dana White was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and Reebok held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal – taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program – will be paid directly to UFC fighters.\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official UFC rankings, with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate. The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card. In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation. The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for UFC 189 in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing – not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances – and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots – similar to those seen with European soccer clubs – that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.\n\nMatches may end via:\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total \"points\" be equal (see, e.g., \"UFC 41\" Penn vs. Uno, or \"UFC 43\" Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of \"win judgments\" from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\nThe ten-point must system is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10–10 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.) Scores of 10–8 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10–7 rounds are very rare.\n\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:\n\n\nWhen a foul is charged, the referee in their discretion may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.\n\n\n\nFights that occur on \"The Ultimate Fighter\" are classified as exhibition matches under NSAC sanctioning, and thus do not count toward the professional record of a fighter. Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"sudden victory\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:\nNon-title fights have a one-pound leniency. In title fights, the participants must weight no more than that permitted for the relevant weight division. The Commission may also approve catch weight bouts, subject to their review and discretion. For example, the Commission may still decide to allow the contest the maximum weight allowed is 177 pounds if it feels that the contest would still be fair, safe, and competitive. In addition, there are five weight classes specified in the Unified Rules which the UFC does not currently use: Super Lightweight (165 pounds), Super Welterweight (175 pounds), Super Middleweight (195 pounds), Cruiserweight (225 pounds), and Super Heavyweight (>265 pounds).\n\nMMA journalists and fans have criticized the UFC for putting on too many shows and thus diluting the quality of their product.\n\nComedian, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Taekwondo black belt Joe Rogan teams up with play-by-play announcer Jon Anik to provide commentary during broadcasts of most UFC events in the US. For 20 years Joe Rogan and Mike Goldberg provided commentary at live events. The \"Veteran Voice of the Octagon\" is announcer Bruce Buffer. Arianny Celeste, Rachelle Leah, Brittney Palmer, Carly Baker, Vanessa Hanson, Chrissy Blair, Jhenny Andrade, Camila Oliveira, Luciana Andrade, Jamilette Gaxiola, and Red Dela Cruz are Octagon girls. Each fighter is assigned a cutman by the promotion who cares for the fighter before the fight and in between rounds. Jacob \"Stitch\" Duran was one of the best known cutmen working for the organization. Matches are made by matchmakers, and VP of Talent Relations, Joe Silva and Sean Shelby.\n\nUFC fighters are paid per fight, with amounts depending on how well-known the fighters are and how well sponsored a fighter and an event is. Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at UFC 202, Conor McGregor made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent Nate Diaz made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history. Cash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\"). The size of these bonuses can sometimes be $80,000 USD (but are normally $50,000 USD). For less well-known fighters, they can be several times larger than the contracted amount for the fight. Contracted amounts generally have to be declared to the state athletic commission; however, the UFC also pays undisclosed locker-room bonuses to fighters. In recent years, UFC fighters' contracts and merchandising rights have been the subject of dispute between fighters (represented by growing the Mixed Martial Arts Fighters Association) and UFC, which has attempted to defend existing regulations.\n\nMark Coleman (16-10-0) \n\nRandy Couture (18-10-0) \n\nPat Miletich (27-5-2) \n\nRoyce Gracie (13-2-2)\n\nMatt Hughes (45-7-0)\n\nChuck Lidell (21-8-0) \n\nForrest Griffin (19-7-0)\n\nDan Severn (70-13-7) \n\nKen Shamrock (26-11-2) \n\nStephan Bonnar (17-8-0) \n\nTito Ortiz 17-11-1 \n\nCharles Lewis \n\n\n\nIn January 2007, Zuffa and video game developer/publisher THQ announced a license agreement giving THQ worldwide rights to develop titles under the UFC brand. The agreement gives THQ exclusive rights to current and next-generation consoles as well as to PC and handheld titles. Also included are \"certain wireless rights\" which were not detailed. The licensing agreement was set to expire in 2011, although it appeared to have been extended to 2017. On June 6, 2012, during the E3 Exhibition, THQ had announced that they will be giving the license of UFC Undisputed to EA.\n\nThe first UFC action figure collectibles were released by Round 5 Corporation in May 2008. Series one of their figures includes Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson, Matt Hughes, Tito Ortiz, and Randy Couture. Series two (released on November 10, 2008) includes Wanderlei Silva, Sean Sherk, Rich Franklin, and Anderson Silva.\n\nIn July 2009, Round 5 acquired the UFC license through Jakks Pacific and subsequently released 5 more series under the UFC and Pride brands. 2 packs were released in August 2010 and includes a UFC Octagon cage and Pride ring display stand. Limited edition versions include fabric walk out tees or paint variations and are limited in number with foil and holographic packaging variances. Special edition and exclusive versions have been released at various UFC Fan Expo events.\n\nOn June 10, 2008, it was announced that UFC had signed an exclusive four-year contract with Jakks Pacific to create action figures for UFC. the schedule envisages the release of these figures in November 2009. They have currently been 8 series released and they feature special Legends, Pride, and WEC style figures as well. Three 2 packs series have also been released, as well as several expo and internet exclusives. There are also several different octagon cage playsets that have been released, including the \"Octagon Playset\", \"Official Scale Octagon Playset\", and \"Electronic Reaction Octagon Playset\". A Pridestyle ring playset was also originally planned; however, no news have been given on its status or release date since then.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery pay-per-view UFC event has been released onto DVD. \"UFC 23\" through \"UFC 29\" were not released in the US on home video or DVD by SEG. They have since been released onto boxsets which feature around 10 events each set, in chronological order.\n\nUFC on-demand content launched for Xbox 360 on December 20, 2011. Subscribers are able to view pay-per-view events in high definition, connect with friends to predict fight results, and have the ability to compare fighter statistics and records. The UFC Fight Pass application was also planned for PlayStation 4 in early 2015.\n\nThe UFC's PPV events are broadcast live on PPV USA and BT Sport in the UK-Ireland until January 1, 2019 when Eleven Sports take over the rights. In Latin America, events are broadcast live on Fighting Sports Network in Pay TV (Cable and Satellite) of SKY Satellite.

She made it during an April 1973 performance while still a student at the University of Iowa. It is one of three photographs she created in reaction to the rape and murder of a woman on campus. The Tate Gallery in London, which owns the work, describes it this way:Mendieta invited her fellow students to her apartment where, through a door left purposefully ajar, they found her in the position recorded in this photograph, which recreated the scene as reported in the press. Some time later, Mendieta recalled that her audience \"all sat down, and started talking about it. I didn’t move. I stayed in position about an hour. It really jolted them.\" In 1980, she commented that the rape had \"moved and frightened\" her, elaborating: \"I think all my work has been like that – a personal response to a situation ... I can’t see being theoretical about an issue like that.\" On another occasion she explained that she had created this work \"as a reaction against the idea of violence against women.\"\n\nArt writer Megan Heuer describes the work as capturing the artist's interest in violence.

Video games were not permitted for import into Brazil until the 1990s, and were then heavily taxed as non-essential goods. As a result, a black market developed around pirating games, driven by the lack of official channels for purchasing games. Many game companies avoided expansion into the country for these reasons until the 2010s. Blaming high tariffs, Nintendo officially left the market in 2015, but returned in 2017. Sega once retained a strong foothold in the country. In a three-episode series named \"Red Bull Parallels\", Red Bull explored the country's relation with gaming.\n\nSince January 2008, the marketing of \"Counter-Strike\" is prohibited in the Brazilian territory by judicial decision. The judge argues that Counter-Strike and \"EverQuest\" games subvert social order.\n\nIt has since been lifted, although EverQuest is still illegal in physical form in Minas Gerais.\n\nVideo game development exists in Brazil since as early as 1983, when Renato Degiovani developed the first computer games in Portuguese called \"\"Aventuras na Selva\" (later renamed \"Amazônia\") and \"Aeroporto 83\"\" (Airport 83) for a computer specialized magazine called \"Micro Sistemas\". Several years have passed with little to no significant development until the 2000s, when several companies started creating advergames and/or MMORPGs, and universities started offering game development degrees. Hoplon was one of the first to be successful in the industry with Taikodom.\n\nThe 2010s have been marked by a growing number of studios getting bigger relevance with proprietary indie game titles. The BIG Festival (Brazilian Independent Games Festival) was conceived in 2012 and is held every year in São Paulo, gathering game industry professionals from the country and abroad and promoting indie titles for the Brazilian market.\n\nThe biggest game dev scenes are from São Paulo, Porto Alegre and Brasília.\n\nPrint Media\n\nThe ClassInd (advisory rating) is the institute responsible for the software given for review on Brazil.\n\n\n"}

The film depicts a technologically advanced, Western-themed amusement park populated by androids that malfunction and begin killing the human visitors; it was followed by the sequel film \"Futureworld\" (1976).\n\nIn 1980, there was a short-lived television series, \"Beyond Westworld\". A television series called \"Westworld\", produced by HBO and based on the original film, debuted on October 2, 2016. A second season aired in April 2018, with a third season ordered the following month.\n\n\"Westworld\" was the first theatrical feature novelist Michael Crichton directed, after one TV movie. It was also the first feature film to use digital image processing to pixellate photography in order to simulate an android's point of view. The film was nominated for Hugo, Nebula and Saturn awards. The film was well-received by critics.\n\nThe story is about amusement park robots that malfunction and begin killing visitors. It stars Yul Brynner as an android in a futuristic Western-themed amusement park, and Richard Benjamin and James Brolin as guests of the park.\n\n\"Futureworld\" is the sequel to the Michael Crichton film. The sequel stars Peter Fonda, Blythe Danner, Arthur Hill, Stuart Margolin, John Ryan, and Yul Brynner, who makes a cameo appearance in a dream sequence. Other than Brynner, none of the cast members from the original film appear, and original writer-director Crichton was not involved.\n\nThe story is set two years after the Westworld tragedy, with the Delos corporation having reopened the park. The story starts when newspaper reporter Chuck Browning (Peter Fonda) and TV reporter Tracy Ballard (Blythe Danner) are invited to review the park.\n\n\"Beyond Westworld\" was created by Michael Crichton which served as a continuation of the two feature films. The series stars Jim McMullan as Security Chief John Moore of the Delos Corporation. The story revolved around Moore having to stop the evil scientist, Quaid, as he plans to use the Delos robots to try to take over the world. It premiered on March 5, 1980 on the television network CBS in the United States. The show was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Makeup and Outstanding Art Direction For a Series. Only five episodes were produced, of which three aired before the series' cancellation.\n\n\"Westworld\" is an American science fiction-thriller television series created by husband-wife duo Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan serves as executive producer along with Joy, J. J. Abrams and Bryan Burk. The series takes place in fictional Westworld, a technologically advanced, Western-themed amusement park populated completely by synthetic androids dubbed \"Hosts\". Westworld caters to high-paying visitors dubbed \"Newcomers\" (also known as \"Guests\"), who can do whatever they wish within the park, without fear of retaliation from the Hosts.\n\n\"Westworld\" premiered on October 2, 2016 on the cable television channel HBO in the United States.\n\nThe series has been well received. The series has also attained strong Nielsen ratings for HBO, with the U.S. series premiere attracting 1.96 million viewers.\n\nA first-person shooter based on the film, titled \"Westworld 2000\", was released in 1996.\n"}
{"id": "11311255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11311255", "title": "Xuxa Park fire", "text": "Xuxa Park fire\n\nThe Xuxa Park fire refers to a flash fire that erupted on a Brazilian TV soundstage in Rio de Janeiro during a 2001 taping of the children's television show \"Xuxa Park\". The incident is noteworthy for having been captured on videotape, for the press coverage that followed, and for accusations about the fire made by some detractors of the show's host.\n\nOn January 11, 2001, a taping of \"Xuxa Park\" was in progress on a soundstage of the Brazilian network Rede Globo with a live audience of about 300 people (most of whom were children) in attendance. As Xuxa and her dancers were performing a show-closing musical number, a small fire started in the set's mechanical \"spaceship\" (through which Xuxa would normally have exited the stage in another 2 minutes). For a few seconds, they continued their musical number, unaware of what was happening behind them. An alert stagehand quickly appeared with a small fire extinguisher and attempted to extinguish the flames, but suddenly the fire erupted violently, engulfing the \"spaceship,\" and he was forced to retreat as others on stage also began to flee. The fire grew and spread quickly and intensively as children, dancers, stagehands, and audience members fled towards the exits to escape the heat, smoke, and melting plastic. Within less than a minute, the entire set was engulfed in flames. Kids were removed from the ferris wheel, which was a part of the scenery. The only one who failed to get out was Thamires. Leonilson, Xuxa's bodyguard, came back to remove her.\n\nThough camera operators and other technicians fled with the others, the cameras continued to operate and feed the videotape machines as the conflagration grew. The footage was shown frequently on Brazilian news shows for days after the fire.\n\nAlthough no one died as a result of the fire (which was ultimately attributed to an electrical short circuit), many were treated for minor smoke inhalation, and four individuals were seriously injured by smoke inhalation and burns. These included Leonilson (nicknamed \"Léo\"), Xuxa's personal bodyguard; the show's resident clown Topetão; and two of the children. The two men helped save many of the children (including one who had become stuck in one of the on-set rides). All eventually recovered from their injuries.\n\nXuxa, who was not injured, nevertheless was strongly affected by the fire, and reportedly spent quite some time afterwards in a deep depression. She visited the fire victims and their families in the hospital frequently. \"Xuxa Park\" went on hiatus after the fire, and was ultimately cancelled. For a time, Xuxa felt unable to perform at all, especially with children. Eventually, she recovered from her malaise and returned to the public eye.\n\nIn 2015, the location became Monica Park.\n\n"}

Youth subcultures offer participants an identity outside of that ascribed by social institutions such as family, work, home and school. Youth subcultures that show a systematic hostility to the dominant culture are sometimes described as countercultures.\n\nYouth music genres are associated with many youth subcultures, such as hip hop, punks, emos, ravers, Juggalos, metalheads and goths. The study of subcultures often consists of the study of the symbolism attached to clothing, music, other visible affections by members of the subculture, and also the ways in which these same symbols are interpreted by members of the dominant culture.\n\nSocioeconomic class, gender, intelligence, conformity, morality, and ethnicity can be important in relation to youth subcultures. Youth subcultures can be defined as meaning systems, modes of expression or lifestyles developed by groups in subordinate structural positions in response to dominant systems — and which reflect their attempt to solve structural contradictions rising from the wider societal context.\n\nThe term \"scene\" can refer to an exclusive subculture or faction. Scenes are distinguished from the broad culture through either fashion; identification with specific (sometimes obscure or experimental) musical genres or political perspectives; and a strong in-group or tribal mentality. The term can be used to describe geographic subsets of a subculture, such as the Detroit drum and bass scene or the London goth scene.\n\nEarly studies in youth culture were mainly produced by functionalist sociologists, and focus on youth as a single form of culture. In explaining the development of the culture, they utilized the concept of \"anomie\". Talcott Parsons argued that as we move from the family and corresponding values to another sphere with differing values, (e.g. the workplace) we would experience an \"anomie situation.\" The generalizations involved in this theory ignore the existence of subcultures.\n\nMarxist theories account for some diversity, because they focus on classes and class-fractions rather than youth as a whole. Stuart Hall and Tony Jefferson described youth subcultures as symbolic or ritualistic attempts to resist the power of bourgeois hegemony by consciously adopting behavior that appears threatening to the establishment. Conversely, Marxists of the Frankfurt School of social studies argue that youth culture is inherently consumerist and integral to the divide-and-rule strategy of capitalism. They argue that it creates generation gaps and pits groups of youths against each other (e.g. mods and rockers), especially as youth culture is the dominant culture in the west.\n\nInteractionist theorist Stan Cohen argues youth subcultures are not coherent social groupings that arise spontaneously as a reaction to social forces, but that mass media labeling results in the creation of youth subcultures by imposing an ideological framework in which people can locate their behavior. Post-structuralist theories of subculture utilize many of the ideas from these other theories, including hegemony and the role of the media. In his book, \"\", Dick Hebdige describes subcultures as a reaction of subordinated groups that challenge the hegemony of the dominant culture. This theory accounts for factors such as gender, ethnicity and age. Youth can be seen as a subordinate group in relation to the dominant, adult society.\n\nHistorical theorist Steven Mintz claims that until about 1955, youth subculture as such did not exist. Children aspired to (or were pulled into) adulthood as fast as their physical development allowed. Marcel Danesi argues that since then, the media, advertisers and others have made youth the dominant culture of Western societies, to the point that many people retain what others consider to be immature attitudes far into adulthood. This is further supported by P. Lewis, who claims that youth culture did not originate until the 1950s, with the development of rock and roll. However, other historians have claimed that youth culture may have developed earlier, particularly in the inter-war period. There were examples of new youth subcultures emerging throughout that period, such as the flapper.\n\nSubcultures may also be seen as extensions of crowds, subcultures that emerge within a specific school. Certain crowds (jocks, geeks, preppies, druggies, emos) are found in many, even most, high schools across the United States, though the particular terms used by the adolescents in them may vary (nerds instead of geeks, etc.). Most of these can be found in other western countries as well, with the exception of jocks. (The United States is unusual in having athletics specifically affiliated with schools, although similar athletic affiliation groups exist in British public schools.) \n"}
