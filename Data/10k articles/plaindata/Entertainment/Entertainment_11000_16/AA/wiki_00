{"id": "32402649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32402649", "title": "A Very Potter Sequel", "text": "A Very Potter Sequel\n\nA Very Potter Sequel (often shortened to AVPS) is a musical with music and lyrics by Darren Criss and a book by Matt Lang, Nick Lang, and Brian Holden. The story is a parody, based on several of the \"Harry Potter\" novels (particularly \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" and \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\") by J. K. Rowling, as well as their film counterparts.\n\n\"A Very Potter Sequel\" picks up where \"A Very Potter Musical\" left off with Lord Voldemort destroyed. Lucius Malfoy then decides to go back in time to Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts to destroy him before he becomes a bigger threat than he already is. \n\nThe musical was performed May 14-16, 2010, on the University of Michigan campus. It was produced by StarKid Productions and directed by Matt Lang. The musical starred Darren Criss as Harry Potter, Joey Richter as Ron Weasley, Bonnie Gruesen as Hermione Granger, Lauren Lopez as Draco Malfoy, and Joe Walker as Dolores Umbridge. The video version of the musical premiered in its entirety at Infinitus, a Harry Potter convention. The video premiered on YouTube July 22, 2010, and within two days had gotten over 160,000 views, making the StarKid Productions page the most viewed of the day.\n\n\"A Very Potter Sequel\" is followed by \"A Very Potter Senior Year\".\n\nLucius Malfoy and Yaxley meet to discuss Lord Voldemort's defeat at the hands of Harry Potter. Lucius describes that if it were not for Harry Potter, they would be reigning supreme. Lucius then explains his plan to use a Time Turner to go back in time to Harry's first year at Hogwarts to destroy him before he can become a threat for the Death Eaters (\"Not Over Yet\").\n\nIn the past Harry Potter shows up at King's Cross station for his first year at Hogwarts and cannot seem to find Platform 9¾. He then meets the Weasleys, who help him find the way. In the midst of this, Harry meets Ron Weasley and the two quickly become the best of friends. Ron and the others at Platform 9¾ discover who Harry is and begin to treat him like a celebrity. Harry asks Ron why they are acting this way toward him, and Ron tells Harry that he is \"The Boy Who Lived,\" as he survived the Killing Curse and defeated Voldemort as a child. Rita Skeeter also tells Harry about the murderer Sirius Black, who betrayed his parents and is now after his life (\"Harry Freakin' Potter\").\n\nOn the Hogwarts Express, Harry and Ron meet Hermione Granger. Meanwhile, a Death Eater knocks out the candy lady and attempts to use the Killing Curse on Harry, but is disarmed by Remus Lupin, who is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. As the train arrives at Hogwarts, Lupin tells Harry not to go looking for trouble. At this point, Harry is introduced to Severus Snape, who instantly takes a disliking to Harry, but Lupin stands up for Harry and Snape flees. Lupin leaves Harry after mentioning that his parents spent the best years of their lives at Hogwarts, leading Harry to believe he has finally found a home (\"To Have a Home\").\n\nAfter Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sorted by the Scarf of Sexual Preference (or \"Scarfy\") into \"Metrosexual\", \"Bi-curious\", and \"Waiting 'til marriage\", respectively, and by the Sorting Hat (or \"Sorty\") into Gryffindor house together, they meet Slytherin Draco Malfoy, who wants to be Harry's friend very badly and tells his associates Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle to torture Ron and Hermione until he agrees. Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore arrives to cease the fighting and welcome everyone to Hogwarts. Dumbledore then introduces the House Cup and \"the silliest of all wizard sports\", Quidditch. Dumbledore introduces Lupin and Snape as the coaches of the Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams, respectively. As Snape begins to taunt Lupin about the full moon, Lupin begins to take on a werewolf transformation and runs away. Dumbledore then introduces the terrifying and musclebound professor Dolores Umbridge, who has been assigned by the Ministry of Magic to keep Harry and the rest of the school safe from Sirius Black. Snape escorts the boys to their dorm, and Dumbledore tells Harry he should be proud to be in Gryffindor, like himself and his parents were. Umbridge is left to instruct the girls on the rules of the dormitory, but intimidates them into submission.\n\nHarry and Ron go to try out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but before they can begin practicing, Snape shows up and he and Lupin argue over which team has the field reserved for the day. The two go to see Dumbledore to settle the matter. Meanwhile, Draco approaches Harry to boast about a picture he drew of him. Hermione attempts to stand up for Harry, but the tables are turned on her as everyone makes fun of her for not being able to draw (\"Hermione Can't Draw\"). Lupin returns to tell the team that he messed up the schedule, but no one seems to care as they are all having too much fun making fun of Hermione. Hermione wishes she could show everyone who she really is (\"The Coolest Girl\").\n\nThe students of Hogwarts are taking a field trip to Hogsmeade, but Harry does not have a signed permission form, so Umbridge decides to harshly punish him. Fortunately for Harry, Neville Longbottom shows up to give Umbridge flowers from \"Big D,\" which puts her in a much better mood. Harry is still not allowed to go, but he manages to escape Umbridge's wrath. Draco also does not have a permission form, so he stays behind to write a letter to his father. Harry meets up with Lupin, who gives him the Marauder's Map so that he can go secretly to Hogsmeade without a permission slip, but advises him not to go to the Shrieking Shack.\n\nUmbridge has become a lot less strict with rules after finding out she has a secret admirer, who is revealed to be Dumbledore. The two then begin a flirting relationship (\"Gettin' Along\"), and after sweeping \"Mr. Umbridge\" off her feet, Dumbledore spirits Umbridge away to make love. Meanwhile, the kids are swapping horrific stories about Sirius Black in Hogsmeade, which ends with Hermione being dared to go to the Shrieking Shack and draw a picture of the monster inside. The other kids are scared off by a werewolf howl. When Harry arrives, he convinces Ron that they must go in to save her. They manage to find her, but are then attacked by a werewolf. Harry fends it off by throwing Hermione's cat Crookshanks at it as bait. The group flees into the Forbidden Forest, where they each discuss their flaws, but because they are at Hogwarts, those flaws do not matter. Harry and Ron finally accept Hermione as their friend. Suddenly, the werewolf returns, but Firenze arrives to save the trio and brings them back to Hogwarts.\n\nWhile everyone is preparing for the Quidditch match, Neville and Rita Skeeter find Lupin half-naked and covered in blood in the woods with the body of a dead doe, which he claims is part of a pre-game ritual. Meanwhile, Dumbledore tells Snape of his evening with Umbridge, which quickly became a disaster when Dumbledore realized Umbridge was actually a woman. Contrary to this, Umbridge has become very clingy to Dumbledore, but when Snape and Dumbledore break the news to her, she goes back to being her old self, declaring that she will destroy Dumbledore and take his job as headmaster of Hogwarts. Lucius (from the future), arrives to meet with Snape, stating he has a lot riding on the Quidditch match, and replaces the majority of the Slytherin team with Death Eaters in order to kill Harry.\n\nThe Quidditch match finally begins (\"Let the Games Begin\"). At half-time, Hedwig shows up with a package for Harry, but Lucius intercepts it. Hermione manages to get it back by cursing Lucius. Lupin scolds the Gryffindor team for their sloppy playing, but Hermione arrives to give Harry his package, which turns out to be just what he needs: a Firebolt broomstick. Draco accidentally interferes with the Death Eaters' attempt on Harry's life and Harry manages to catch the Golden Snitch, winning the game for Gryffindor. Lucius is furious with Draco and crumples up the drawing Draco had made for him, disowning him.\n\nHermione prepares to leave Hogwarts for the holidays and gives Harry and Ron a scrapbook of their first semester at Hogwarts, including a newspaper clipping about Sirius Black that mentions Harry. Snape charges into the room screaming that Sirius Black has infiltrated Hogwarts. Harry becomes enraged after being reminded that Sirius was the man responsible for his parents' murder and decides to go find him using the Marauder's Map. The map leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione to a room containing a large mirror. As Harry approaches the mirror, he sees two mysterious figures in it. Sirius Black reveals himself and explains that it is the Mirror of Erised, which shows one's deepest desires. In the case of both Harry and Sirius, it shows Harry's parents. Sirius explains that he was framed for the murder of Harry's parents, so Harry and Sirius reconcile (\"Those Voices\"). Sirius then tells the trio that someone named \"Little D\" helped him escape from Azkaban prison and make his way to Hogwarts. Sirius also gives Harry his father's Cloak of Invisibility as well as telling him that it was he who sent the Firebolt. Hermione sees someone coming on the Marauder's Map, so Sirius tries to throw the Invisibility Cloak over the trio, but Harry ends up putting it on Sirius. Snape arrives and begins taking his anger out on Harry, forcing Sirius to reveal himself. After the two trade insults about how Harry's mother chose James over Snape, Dumbledore and Umbridge show up. Umbridge tries to take Harry, Ron, and Hermione to Azkaban for helping Sirius get into Hogwarts, but Dumbledore tells her that it was he who helped Sirius get in. Umbridge then presents an ultimatum: \"Either kiss the dementors, or kiss Umbridge\". Desperate, Dumbledore Disapparates with Scarfy, leaving Umbridge to take over Hogwarts. As she corrals Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Sirius away, Snape looks in the Mirror of Erised and sees Lily.\n\nEveryone is shaken up by all the new regulations instated by Umbridge, including cancelling the Valentine's Day Dance, removing the moving paintings, and having the Ghostbusters chase away all the ghosts in the school, as well as put strict regulations on what the professors are allowed to teach. Lupin tries to cheer everyone up by teaching them a spell to ward off Dementors, called the Patronus Charm. Umbridge interrupts the lesson and fires Lupin due to not following the proper curriculum or even the assigned textbook (to which Lupin replies \"That textbook is like a thousand years old! It still refers to dementors as ringwraiths.\") Lupin leaves, much to Snape's delight, but apologizes to him for making fun of him when they were children. Umbridge takes the position of Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, and introduces \"Mama's Little Love Hand\", which she threatens them with. Hermione tries to stand up to Umbridge, but Umbridge sees her as herself at her age and promises to mold her in her image, starting by punishing her first. The whole class then stands up for Hermione and Snape decides to step in and take them to Potions class. Umbridge gives up but gives the class detention. She then asks Harry where Dumbledore is hiding, but Harry tells her that even if he did know he wouldn't tell her.\n\nUmbridge is having a good time teasing the Sorting Hat and replacing Dumbledore's Zac Efron poster with one of Taylor Lautner, but still has her doubts about being liked. She is then visited by the spirit of her dead mother who whips Umbridge into shape, and convinces her to kill the students of Hogwarts. Umbridge calls Snape to her office to ask him to kill Harry for her. Lucius also arrives and suggests that he and Umbridge team up to capture Dumbledore and kill Harry. Snape threatens to report their planning to the Ministry of Magic, but Lucius convinces him otherwise by showing Snape his memories of James and Lily Potter using the Pensieve to show him the type of people the Potters really are (\"Guys Like Potter\").\n\nThe students read in \"The Daily Prophet\" that Sirius has been sentenced to death, and Umbridge will now have Dementors surrounding Hogwarts full-time. While most of the first years are ordered to clean the Owlery, Harry is asked to come to Umbridge's office alone. When Harry arrives, Lucius appears from the shadows and attacks him. As the others are cleaning, Ron assures Hermione that she is nothing like Umbridge (using Spider-Man as an analogy like in the first show), and hints that he may have a crush on her. They are interrupted by a message from \"Little D,\" who wants to meet them in order to save Harry. \"Little D\" is revealed to be Draco, but this Draco is from the future like Lucius. Draco explains that Lucius came back in time to kill Harry and that he, Draco, was actually the one behind helping Sirius escape from Azkaban and having Firenze save Harry and company from the werewolf. Harry wakes up to find Lucius and the Death Eaters preparing to torture him and that Lucius and Umbridge have formed an alliance. Ron, Hermione, and Draco enter the room disguised as Death Eaters and manage to free Harry. Lucius grabs Draco, but Snape enters and saves them, allowing the children to escape.\n\nHarry and company free Sirius and Lupin returns to help. Lupin and Sirius explain that their and James' supposedly deceased friend Peter Pettigrew, who was disguised as a nearby Taylor Lautner poster, was actually behind the crimes Sirius was accused of. Ron tricks Pettigrew by offering him a Red Vine and the group captures him. As the group prepares to head to the Ministry of Magic to turn Pettigrew in, Lupin sees the full moon and becomes a werewolf. Pettigrew uses this as a distraction to get away. Lupin attacks Sirius, but suddenly, werewolf calls emanate from the Forbidden Forest, causing Lupin to chase after them. As the kids tend to Sirius, Umbridge appears, determined to finally punish them. Dumbledore returns and stands up to Umbridge, announcing that he is gay and will use force if necessary to end her reign of terror. Umbridge is too strong, however, and refuses to back down (\"Stutter\"). Harry tries to save Sirius from the Dementors, but passes out.\n\nDumbledore manages to get the kids out of danger, but tells them to stay put while he goes to search for help. Harry and the others feel all is hopeless, but Draco remembers that he has Lucius' Time Turner, which the group uses to travel back in time one hour. Harry meets up with the past Snape and inspires him to save Harry and friends later on during the fight with Lucius. Ron is still discouraged of their chances for victory, but Harry boosts the group's morale by convincing them that there is a way (\"No Way\"). Harry and the others run into Lucius, but Draco stands up to him at last and recruits Yaxley to their side. Lucius, however, shocks Draco with a horrible secret: he is not his real father. Years ago, his wife had an affair with their house-elf, Dobby, which resulted in Draco's birth. Lucius gets free and tortures Hermione, making her howl in pain. Before he is able to kill her, Lupin shows up in his werewolf form and kills him.\n\nHarry and the others then arrive at the scene of Umbridge and her dementors just as Dumbledore disapparates with their past selves. They each use the Patronus Charm to scare off the Dementors. Harry is about to take Umbridge down when she grabs hold of him. Firenze arrives just in time to save him and fights an epic battle with Umbridge, which ends with Firenze falling in love with Umbridge's brute incredible strength and taking her as a mate to save the dying race of centaurs.\n\nHarry, Lupin, and the others provide evidence to clear Sirius' name. Sirius and Lupin, both jobless and homeless, decide to travel the world together. The rest of the people at Hogwarts decide to have a huge party to celebrate (\"Hermione Can't Draw (Reprise)\"). The future Draco tells Hermione he is not going with as he could run into his past self, causing a temporal paradox. Before he leaves, he confesses his love for Hermione, but she shoots him down. However, Draco meets Luna Lovegood, and the two bond over Pigfarts, the wizarding school on Mars. In Dumbledore's office, the Sorting Hat and Scarfy are reunited and they both decide to get married. Harry visits Dumbledore and the two discuss that their days away from Hogwarts are what make the time they have there so precious. Harry and the others all say goodbye for the summer, knowing that there will always be a way back. (\"Days of Summer\"/\"Goin' Back to Hogwarts\").\n\n\nSimilarly to \"A Very Potter Musical\", Darren Criss had altered some of the songs he had already written in order to use them in the musical. The song \"Guys Like Potter\" was adapted from a song he had written about a friend named Peter, while \"Days of Summer\" was a running joke in StarKid Productions as it was a song originally written for the web series \"Little White Lie\" that ended up not being used until the \"Sequel\". The song \"Stutter\" was also previously written by Criss, subsequently being used for the musical. The remaining songs in \"Sequel\" were written specifically for the show, and Criss wrote them all in about a month.\n\n\"A Very Potter Sequel\" was performed May 14-16th, 2010, on the University of Michigan campus. The video version of the musical premiered in its entirety at Infinitus, a Harry Potter convention. The video premiered on YouTube July 22, 2010.\n\nA formal cast recording of the musical was not released. However, the musical's songs were recorded by the cast and released on two separate albums. The first, \"A Very StarKid Album\", was released alongside the YouTube premiere of \"A Very Potter Sequel\" on July 22, 2010, through iTunes and Amazon.com. The album features seven of the musical's twelve songs (excluding the \"Hermione Can't Draw (Reprise)\" and \"Goin' Back to Hogwarts\") along with other songs from members of StarKid. The album reached No. 19 on Billboard's Top Compilation Albums as well as reaching No. 14 on the iTunes Pop charts and No. 27 of all albums.\n\nOn July 31, 2010, StarKid released a supplementary EP through their Bandcamp account, titled the \"A Very Potter Sequel\" soundtrack. The EP features the remaining five songs from the musical. StarKid also released \"A Very StarKid Album\" on Bandcamp on August 3, 2010.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6195987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6195987", "title": "Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi", "text": "Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi\n\n\"Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi\" is a cheer or chant often performed at Australian sport events. It is a variation of the Oggy Oggy Oggy chant used by both association football and rugby union fans in Great Britain from the 1960s onwards. It is usually performed by a crowd uniting to support a sports team or athlete. The alternate is for an individual to chant the line \"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!\" and the crowd to respond with \"Oi! Oi! Oi!\". A variation of this is for an individual to chant, \"Aussie!\", with the crowd responding, \"Oi!\", along the lines of, \"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!\", \"Oi, Oi, Oi!\"' \"Aussie!\", \"Oi!\", \"Aussie\", Oi!\", \"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!\", \"Oi, Oi, Oi!\".\n\nThe full version of the chant, as heard prior to a free outdoor concert at the time of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and quoted by Luba Vangelova of CNNSI, is as follows:\n\nThe chant was widely used during the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, being heard at many public entertainment venues and also on public transport. The chant came to be commonly heard at international sporting events where an Australian team was competing.\n\nA chant of similar form, \"Oggy Oggy Oggy\", has been used for decades by football crowds in Britain.\n\nMembers of the British Royal Navy claim to have used the Oggy Oggy Oggy chant, or a version of it, since the Second World War.\n\nEnglishman Ron Knox claims to have used the \"Oggy\" chant while playing for the Box Hill Rugby Club in Melbourne in the late 1960s. Various conflicting stories of how it was introduced from Britain to Australia can be found.\n\nAccording to Stephen Alomes, a professor of Australian studies at Deakin University, the chant represents \"enthusiasm for the tribe\" and a \"celebration of 'us'\", but at the extreme may act as a symbol of aggressive nationalism and xenophobia.\n\nIn 2012, after Foxtel offered a $10,000 prize in a competition for coming up with a new phrase to cheer on athletes, Germaine Greer argued:\n\n\"The cry is catchy. Any crowd can pick it up and it cuts through the surrounding white noise like a military tattoo. It is as jingoistic to reject it because it was originally British as it would be to prize it for the same reason ... There will be no silencing Australian fans at the Olympics and they won't be bullied by Foxtel, either.\"\n\nAt the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, the IOC President, Juan Antonio Samaranch reflected\nthe spirit of the whole affair when, during his formal speech, he said, \"What can I say? Maybe, with my Spanish accent,\nAussie! Aussie! Aussie!\". The response to these words came from all around the stadium, \"Oi! Oi! Oi!\".\n\nIn 2004, a Melbourne couple, inspired by a Dick Smith campaign supporting Australian-made products, and following publicity surrounding the ownership of the trademark for the Australian-developed Ugg boots being owned by a United States company, registered the phrase as an official trademark in an effort to protect it from overseas exploitation.\n\nAt the conclusion of winning the main event of the 2005 World Series of Poker, Australian supporters of winner Joe Hachem chanted this victoriously during the primetime viewing of the poker event on ESPN.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Prize giving ceremony for the 2008 Super 14 final at AMI Stadium in Christchurch, New Zealand, the winning team, the Crusaders, chanted \"Robbie Robbie Robbie Oi Oi Oi\" to farewell their Coach Robbie Deans, who was leaving to coach the Australian national team, the Wallabies.\n\nIt is also a popular chant during Australian Cricket Team's matches.\n\nThe chant is also a fixture at men's basketball games at Saint Mary's College of California, a school that has regularly featured Australian players in the 21st century.\n\n"}
{"id": "481649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=481649", "title": "Basic Instinct", "text": "Basic Instinct\n\nBasic Instinct is a 1992 neo-noir erotic thriller film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas, and starring Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone. The film follows a police detective, Nick Curran (Douglas), who is investigating the brutal murder of a wealthy rock star. During the investigation Curran becomes involved in a torrid and intense relationship with the prime suspect, Catherine Tramell (Stone), an enigmatic writer.\n\nEven before its release, \"Basic Instinct\" generated heated controversy due to its overt sexuality and graphic depiction of violence. It was strongly opposed by gay rights activists, who criticized the film's depiction of homosexual relationships and the portrayal of a bisexual woman as a murderous, narcissistic psychopath. In a 2006 interview, Stone alleged that a scene in which her vulva was exposed as she crossed her legs was filmed without her knowledge.\n\nDespite initial critical negativity and public protest, \"Basic Instinct\" became one of the most financially successful films of the 1990s, grossing $352 million worldwide. Several versions of the film have been released on videocassette, DVD, and Blu-ray including a director's cut with extended footage previously unseen in North American cinemas. The film has contemporarily been recognized for its groundbreaking depictions of sexuality in mainstream Hollywood cinema, and has been referred to by scholars as \"a neo-noir masterpiece that plays with, and transgresses, the narrative rules of film noir.\" A 2006 sequel, \"Basic Instinct 2\", starred Stone and was made without Verhoeven's involvement, but received either negative or moderate reviews from critics (mainly because of the inevitable comparison with the original movie) and was not particularly successful at the box office.\n\nIn San Francisco, homicide detective Nick Curran investigates the murder of retired rock star Johnny Boz, who has been brutally stabbed to death with an ice pick during sex by a mysterious blonde woman. Nick's only suspect is Boz's bisexual girlfriend, crime novelist Catherine Tramell, who has written a novel that mirrors the crime. It is concluded that either Catherine is the murderer or someone is attempting to frame her. Catherine is uncooperative and taunting during the investigation, smoking and exposing herself during her interrogation. She has an alibi and passes a lie detector test. Nick discovers Catherine has a history of befriending murderers, including her girlfriend Roxy, who killed her two younger brothers, on impulse, when she was 16, and Hazel Dobkins, who killed her family.\n\nNick, who accidentally shot two tourists while high on cocaine, attends counseling sessions with police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner, with whom he once had an affair. Nick discovers that Catherine is basing the protagonist of her latest book on him, wherein his character is murdered after falling for the wrong woman. Catherine has bribed Lt. Nielsen for information from Nick's psychiatric file; Beth gives it to Nielsen after he recommends Nick's termination. After Nick assaults Nielsen, he becomes a prime suspect when Nielsen is killed. Nick suspects Catherine, and when he joins in her behavior in front of his co-workers, he is put on leave.\n\nNick and Catherine begin a torrid affair with the air of a cat-and-mouse game. Nick arrives at a club and witnesses Catherine doing coke with Roxy and another man. Nick and Catherine dance, make out, and are later observed having sex by Roxy. Catherine ties Nick to her bed with a white silk scarf the same way the blonde woman did with Boz, but does not kill him. Roxy, jealous of Nick, attempts to run him over with Catherine's car, but dies when the car crashes. Catherine grieves Roxy's death and tells Nick about a previous lesbian encounter at college that went awry. The girl became obsessed with her, causing Nick to believe that Catherine may not have killed Boz. Nick identifies the girl as Beth, who acknowledges the encounter, but claims it was Catherine who became obsessed.\n\nNick discovers the final pages of Catherine's book in which the fictional detective finds his partner's body. Catherine breaks off their affair; Nick becomes upset and suspicious. Nick later meets his partner Gus, who has arranged to meet with Catherine's college roommate at an office building to find out what really went on between Catherine and Beth. As Nick waits in the car, Gus is stabbed to death with an ice pick. Nick runs into the building, only to find Gus' body in a manner similar to the scene described in the book. Beth, standing in the hallway, explains that she received a message to meet Gus. Nick suspects she murdered Gus and, believing she is reaching for a gun, shoots her, only to find that Beth was only fingering an ornament on her key chain.\n\nA search of the scene and Beth's apartment turns up the evidence needed to identify her as the killer. Despite knowing Catherine's apparent foreknowledge of Gus' death, that she must actually have been the killer, and that she must have set up Beth, Nick tells no one. He returns to his apartment where Catherine meets him. She explains her reluctance to commit to him and the two have sex. As they discuss their future, an ice pick is revealed to be under the bed.\n\nThe screenplay, written in the 1980s, was popular enough to prompt a bidding war; it was eventually purchased by Carolco Pictures, for a reported US$3 million. Eszterhas wrote the film in 13 days, and had been the creative source for several other blockbusters, including \"Flashdance\" (1983) and \"Jagged Edge\" (1985). Gary Goldman was subsequently hired to do a minor re-write on the script.\n\nAl Pacino, Harrison Ford, Wesley Snipes, Robert De Niro, Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Lloyd, Jack Nicholson, Charlie Sheen, Richard Gere, John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Denzel Washington, Kevin Costner and several other famous actors were considered for the role of Nick Curran. In preparation for the car chase scene, Douglas reportedly drove up the steps on Kearny Street in San Francisco for four nights by himself. Douglas recommended Kim Basinger for the role of Catherine Tramell, but Basinger declined. He had also proposed Julia Roberts, Greta Scacchi and Meg Ryan, but they also turned down the role, as did Michelle Pfeiffer, Geena Davis, Kathleen Turner, Ellen Barkin, and Mariel Hemingway. Verhoeven considered Demi Moore. Stone, who was eventually selected for the role, was a relative unknown until the success of this film; she was paid a minimal amount of $500,000, considering the film's extensive production budget.\n\nFilming in San Francisco was attended by gay and lesbian rights activists and demonstrators, and San Francisco Police Department riot police were present at every location daily to deal with the crowds.\n\nIn the scene in which Stone's vulva was exposed on camera as she crossed her legs, Stone believed that the character's not wearing underwear would only be alluded to and not shown. She had been wearing white underwear until Verhoeven said they reflected light on the camera lens and asked her to take them off, assuring her that only shadow would be visible. It was not until Stone saw the film in a screening room with a test audience that she became aware of it, leading her to slap Verhoeven in the face and leave the screening. However, Verhoeven strongly denied her claim, and said she was fully aware in advance that her vulva would be filmed.\n\nThe film score to \"Basic Instinct\" was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The score to \"Basic Instinct\" garnered Goldsmith nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Goldsmith described it as one of his most challenging efforts, later stating, \"\"Basic Instinct\" was probably the most difficult I've ever done. It's a very convoluted story with very unorthodox characters. It's a murder mystery, but it isn't really a murder mystery. The director, Paul Verhoeven, had a very clear idea of how the woman should be, and I had a hard time getting it. Because of Paul pushing me, I think it's one of the best scores I've ever written. It was a true collaboration.\"\n\nApart from the score, professionally released music did not play a major part in the film. The scene in which source music plays a prominent role occurs during the club scene; Curran, Tramell, and Roxy are seen at Downtown San Francisco. It features \"Blue\" by Chicago house music performer LaTour and \"Rave the Rhythm\" by the group Channel X. It also features \"Movin' on Up\" by Jeff Barry and Ja'Net DuBois.\n\nThe soundtrack was released on March 17, 1992. A considerably expanded release of Jerry Goldsmith's score, featuring previously omitted sections and alternative compositions of certain elements, was issued by Prometheus Records in 2004.\n\nOriginal Motion Picture Soundtrack\n\nThe Complete Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n\nThe film was entered into the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\"Basic Instinct\" is rated R for \"strong violence and sensuality, and for drug use and language\". It was initially given an NC-17 rating by the MPAA, but under pressure from TriStar, Verhoeven cut 35–40 seconds to gain an R rating. Verhoeven described the changes in a March 1992 article in \"The New York Times\": \nThe film was subsequently re-released in its uncut format on video and later on DVD.\n\nFollowing the theatrical version, the film was first released in its uncut format in an unrated version onto video in 1992, running at 129 minutes. This was followed by a DVD release in 1997, in a \"barebones\" format that contained the R-rated version. A Collector's Edition was released on DVD in 2001, containing the uncut version of the film with a commentary by Camille Paglia and a small ice-pick (the villain's weapon of choice). This version of the film, running 127 minutes, was re-released twice: in 2003 and 2006.\n\nIn March 2006, the unrated version (also known as the Director's Cut) was re-released on DVD and labeled as the Ultimate Edition. In 2007, the film was released on Blu-ray with the Director's Cut label.\n\nThe film was cut by 35–40 seconds to avoid an NC-17 rating on its theatrical release in 1992, with some violence and sexuality explicit content removed. The missing or censored material (later released on video and DVD unrated as the \"director's cut\") included:\n\n\"Basic Instinct\" opened in theaters in the United States and was one of the highest-grossing films of 1992, after its March 29 release. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $15 million. It was the fourth highest-grossing film of 1992, grossing $352,927,224 worldwide.\n\nThe film's critical reaction was mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 54% based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10 and the consensus: \"Unevenly echoing the work of Alfred Hitchcock, \"Basic Instinct\" contains a star-making performance from Sharon Stone, but is ultimately undone by its problematic, overly lurid plot.\" On Metacritic the film holds a score of 41 based on 28 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" praised the film, saying \"\"Basic Instinct\" transfers Mr. Verhoeven's flair for action-oriented material to the realm of Hitchcockian intrigue, and the results are viscerally effective even when they don't make sense.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" also praised the film, saying it was a guilty pleasure film; he also expressed admiration for Verhoeven's direction, saying \"[his] cinematic wet dream delivers the goods, especially when Sharon Stone struts on with enough come-on carnality to singe the screen,\" and praised Stone's performance: \"Stone, a former model, is a knockout; she even got a rise out of Ah-nold in Verhoeven's \"Total Recall\". But being the bright spot in too many dull movies (\"He Said, She Said\"; \"Irreconcilable Differences\") stalled her career. Though \"Basic Instinct\" establishes Stone as a bombshell for the Nineties, it also shows she can nail a laugh or shade an emotion with equal aplomb.\"\n\nThe international critical reception was favorable, with Australian critic Shannon J. Harvey of the \"Sunday Times\" calling it one of the \"1990s['] finest productions, doing more for female empowerment than any feminist rally. Stone – in her star-making performance – is as hot and sexy as she is ice-pick cold.\"\n\nThe film was not without its detractors. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" dismissed the film, giving it two out of four stars, stating that the film is well crafted, yet dies down in the last half hour: \"The film is like a crossword puzzle. It keeps your interest until you solve it. Then it's just a worthless scrap with the spaces filled in.\" Dave Kehr of the \"Chicago Tribune\" also gave a negative review, calling it psychologically empty: \"Verhoeven does not explore the dark side, but merely exploits it, and that makes all the difference in the world.\" \n\nThe film generated controversy due to its overt sexuality and graphic depiction of violence. During principal photography, the film was protested against by gay rights activists who felt that the film followed a pattern of negative depiction of homosexuals in film. Members of the lesbian and bisexual activist group LABIA protested against the film on its opening night. Others also picketed theatres to dissuade people from attending screenings, carrying signs saying \"Kiss My Ice Pick\", \"Hollywood Promotes Anti-Gay Violence\" and \"Catherine Did It!\"/\"Save Your Money—The Bisexual Did It\". Verhoeven himself defended the groups' right to protest, however he criticized the disruptions they caused, saying \"Fascism is not in raising your voice; the fascism is in not accepting the no.\"\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert mentioned the controversy in his review, saying \"As for the allegedly offensive homosexual characters: The movie's protesters might take note of the fact that this film's heterosexuals, starting with Douglas, are equally offensive. Still, there is a point to be made about Hollywood's unremitting insistence on typecasting homosexuals—particularly lesbians—as twisted and evil.\" Camille Paglia denounced gay activist and feminist protests against \"Basic Instinct\", and called Sharon Stone's performance \"one of the great performances by a woman in screen history\", praising her character as \n\"a great vamp figure, like Mona Lisa herself, like a pagan goddess\".\n\nThe film was also widely criticized for glamorizing cigarette smoking. Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas was later diagnosed with throat cancer and publicly apologized for glamorizing smoking in his films.\n\n"}
{"id": "511296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=511296", "title": "Baudolino", "text": "Baudolino\n\nBaudolino is a 2000 novel by Umberto Eco about the adventures of a man named Baudolino in the known and mythical Christian world of the 12th century.\n\n\"Baudolino\" was translated into English in 2001 by William Weaver. The novel presented a number of particular difficulties in translation, not the least of which is that there are ten or so pages written in a made-up language that is a mixture of Latin, medieval Italian and other languages (intended to reconstruct how a barely-literate Italian peasant boy of the 12th century would have tried to write in the vernacular).\n\nIn the year of 1204, Baudolino of Alessandria enters Constantinople, unaware of the Fourth Crusade that has thrown the city into chaos. In the confusion, he meets Niketas Choniates and saves his life. Niketas is amazed by his language genius, speaking many languages he has never heard, and on the question: if he is not part of the crusade, who is he? Baudolino begins to recount his life story to Niketas.\n\nHis story begins in 1155, when Baudolino – a highly talented Italian peasant boy – is sold to and adopted by the emperor Frederick I. At court and on the battlefield, he is educated in reading and writing Latin and learns about the power struggles and battles of northern Italy at the time. He is sent to Paris to become a scholar.\n\nIn Paris, he gains friends (such as the Archpoet, Abdul, Robert de Boron and Kyot, the purported source of Wolfram von Eschenbach's \"Parzival\") and learns about the legendary kingdom of Prester John. From this event onward, Baudolino dreams of reaching this fabled land.\n\nThe earlier parts of the story follow the general historical and geographical outlines of 12th-century Europe, with special emphasis on the Emperor Frederick's futile efforts to subdue the increasingly independent and assertive city states of Northern Italy. Baudolino, being both a beloved adopted son to the Emperor and a loyal native of the newly founded and highly rebellious town of Alessandria, plays a key role in effecting reconciliation between the Emperor and the Alessandria townspeople, who are led by Baudolino's biological father; a way is found for the Emperor to recognize Alessandria's independence without losing face. (It is no accident that Alessandria is Umberto Eco's own hometown.)\n\nThe incident of the death of Emperor Frederick, while on the Third Crusade, is a key element of the plot. This part involves an element of secret history – the book asserts that Emperor Frederick had not drowned in a river, as history records, but died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. This part also constitutes a historical detective mystery – specifically, a historical locked room mystery – with various suspects suggested, each of whom had a clever means of killing the Emperor, and with Baudolino acting as the detective.\n\nAfter the Emperor's death, Baudolino and his friends set off on a long journey, encompassing 15 years, to find the Kingdom of Prester John. From the moment when they depart eastwards, the book becomes pure fantasy – the lands which the band travels bearing no resemblance to the continent of Asia at that or any other historical time, being rather derived from the various myths which Europeans had about Asia – including the aforementioned Christian myth of the Kingdom of Prester John, as well as the Jewish myth of the Ten Lost Tribes and the River Sambation, and some earlier accounts provided by Herodotos. Baudolino meets eunuchs, unicorns, Blemmyes, skiapods and pygmies. At one point, he falls in love with a female satyr-like creature who recounts to him the full Gnostic creation myth; Gnosticism is a pervasive presence in another of Eco's novels, \"Foucault's Pendulum\". Philosophical debates are mixed with comedy, epic adventure and creatures drawn from the strangest medieval bestiaries.\n\nAfter many disastrous adventures, the destruction of Prester John's Kingdom by the White Huns followed by a long stint of slavery at the hands of the Old Man of the Mountain, Baudolino and surviving members of his band of friends return to Constantinople undergoing the agony of the Fourth Crusade – the book's starting point. The wise and rather cynical Niketas Choniates helps Baudolino to at last discover the truth about how the Emperor Frederick died – with shattering results for Baudolino and his friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39278203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39278203", "title": "Bushranger ban", "text": "Bushranger ban\n\nThe bushranger ban refers to a ban on films about bushrangers that came in effect in Australia in 1911-12. Films about bushrangers had been the most popular genre of local films ever since \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" (1906). Governments were worried about the influence this would have on the population and bans against films depicting bushrangers were introduced in South Australia (1911), New South Wales (a 1912 amendment to the 1908 New South Wales Theatres and Public Halls Act) and Victoria (1912).\n\nThe decision had a considerable impact on the local industry as it meant filmmakers could not work in a popular genre. Australian film production, which in 1911 was one of the highest in the world, went into decline.\n\nThe ban was still in effect in the 1930s and hurt efforts to make a number of Australian movies, including an adaptation of \"Robbery Under Arms\" from director Ken G. Hall. A ban on a film about Ned Kelly, \"When the Kellys Rode\" was not lifted until 1942.\n\nThe Hollywood bushranging film \"Stingaree\" (1934) was screened in every state of Australia except for New South Wales because of the ban.\n\nThe bushranger genre of Australian film fictionalized the experiences of bushrangers from Australian history. Bushrangers were outlaws, most active in the 19th century, and remembered in Australian folklore for their acts of robbery and violent crime, including murder. The genre showed how the bushrangers’ intimate connection with the bush allowed them to skirt the law and engage in outlaw activity. Many of the films made before the ban glorified bushrangers, rather than making them seem criminal.\n\nEarly bushranger films include \"Bushranging in Northern Queensland\" and \"Robbery of a Mail Coach by Bushrangers.\" Both were released in 1904 and ran five minutes long and six minutes long respectively. \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\", about the bushranger Ned Kelly, was released in Melbourne on December 26, 1906. \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" is notable for being the first feature film ever made. At the time of its release, it was considered to be the longest film that had ever been made, running at around seventy to eighty minutes.\n\nLike the majority of the bushranger films that would follow it, \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" was relatively sympathetic to the outlaws whose lives it fictionalized. As a result, the government of Victoria tried to censor it when it was first released, claiming that it was encouraging crime. It was banned in two towns that had a relation to the gang presented in the movie. Despite government discontent, \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" was a major commercial success, both nationally and internationally. One of the producers of the film stated that it made 25,000 pounds, in comparison to its budget of 1000 pounds.\n\nThe success of \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" encouraged filmmakers to produce even more bushranger films. Between 1900 and 1914, one hundred and sixteen bushranger films were made in Australia. Most, if not all, of these films focused on the lives of white male bushrangers. A few of the most significant bushranger films made in this period include \"Thunderbolt\" (1910), \"Captain Midnight, the Bush King\" (1911), multiple adaptations of the classic bushranger novel \"Robbery Under Arms\", and \"Dan Morgan\" (1911). \"Dan Morgan\" was notable for depicting its protagonist, the historical outlaw Dan Morgan, as a true criminal, rather than an anti-hero. The graphic violence of \"Dan Morgan\" was unlike the content of any bushranger film before it, and it spurred the governments of New South Wales and Victoria to pass regulations on film content the very next year.\n\nIn 1912, New South Wales’s Theatres and Public Halls Act was amended to directly target the content of films. Specifically, the 1912 amendment was meant to prohibit the screening of “objectionable” films – films with“scenes suggestive of immorality or indecency, executions, murders, or other revolting scenes; scenes of debauchery, low habits of life, or other scenes such as would have a demoralizing effect on young person; successful crime, such as bushranging, robberies, or other acts of lawlessness…”The New South Wales government claimed that the Theatres and Public Halls Act of 1912 was meant to protect film audiences, particularly young audiences, from “injurious influence.” This included the criminal activity of bushrangers. They were also against most bushranger films' depiction of the police as an antagonistic force. Anyone going against the Act could be subject to a fine of up to 20 pounds.\n\nThe police were placed in charge of censoring films in accordance with the standards set by the 1912 amendment. They were to look over film summaries in order to determine their appropriateness, and could also demand a screening of a film if they thought it contained any “objectionable” material.\n\nIn 1917, state censor boards were supplemented by a national Commonwealth Film Censorship Board. The national Censorship Board judged the content of imported films, primarily those from Britain and the USA. State censor boards could take additional action if they believed that the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board had acted too leniently.\n\nIn 1920, the Chief Secretary of Victoria attempted to prevent the development of a film about the Kelly Gang that he believed would spread a negative image of Victoria. The Australian government feared that attempts to ban the film in Australia would result in its international distribution. The government worried that the international release of any films that portrayed Australia negatively would damage the country’s global image. Though the government could not intervene in the creation of a film, it could control its distribution. That year, the Minister of Customs was placed in charge of regulating the export of films from Australia to other parts of the world.\n\nBefore the bushranger ban, bushranging had been the most common topic for Australian films. After the ban, film production in Australia decreased as creators lost their most popular genre and the audiences it drew to the theatres. Unsurprisingly, the new censorship forces were met with discontent from the Australian film industry. H.M. Hawkins, the managing director of Spencer’s Pictures, argued that censorship would limit the industry’s ability grow, since depictions of crime were essential to the creation of a successful drama. In December of 1916, a week after a violent film about gambling was prevented from being screened, a group of Australian film exhibitors gathered to discuss the impact of censorship on their business. They expressed frustration with the fact that the police were in charge of film censors, claiming that the police department was most threatened by bushranger films' depictions of crime and as a result was hardest on crime in film over all other content. They also pointed out that films were being censored far more harshly than written material with the same content.\n\nThe primary threat the New South Wales government saw in bushranger films was their apparent glorification of crime. As a result, some bushranger films could get through the censors if the criminal activity they depicted was condemned within the film and law enforcement wasn’t shown in a negative light. However, because of the stigma that had developed around the genre, few directors were willing to risk making bushranger films, especially if they had established reputations to uphold. In 1920, the director Raymond Longford avoided adapting \"Robbery Under Arms\" in order to preserve his status within the Australian film industry.\n\nThe end of the bushranger ban was arguably indicated by the 1942 release of \"When the Kellys Rode\" in New South Wales. \"When the Kellys Rode\", a bushranger film about the Kelly Gang, had been banned in 1934. It was the last film banned under the Theatres and Public Halls Act for bushranging content. Jack Baddeley, Chief Secretary of New South Wales, finally allowed it to screen in New South Wales in the midst of World War II, claiming that the crimes that the film depicted were nothing compared to “the unbridled horrors of war.” After \"When the Kellys Rode\", the Theatres and Public Halls Act was invoked again by Chief Secretary Baddeley to ban the violent British film \"Brighton Rock\". \"Brighton Rock\" had been allowed into Australia by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Appeals Board, and the Chief Secretary would state no reason for the decision to ban the film in New South Wales.\n\nBy the time that bushranger ban was finally lifted in the 1940s, the popularity of and demand for the genre had already faded. Even after bushranging in film was legal, at least one attempt to produce a bushranger film was met with discontent from Australian citizens. In 1947, residents of Glenrowan, a town associated with the Kelly Gang, protested against Harry Southwell’s plans to shoot a film about Ned Kelly in their town. Glenrowan’s farmers sent a petition to Parliament to ban the film, claiming that bushranger films had given a negative reputation to the descendants of the Kelly Gang.\n\n\n"}

It was priced at 15 cents, when the average comic cost a dime.\n\nMany stories in \"Comic Cavalcade\" were scripted by other than the characters' regular writers, for deadline reasons. Batman writer Bill Finger, for example, would occasionally write Flash stories for \"Comic Cavalcade\" when regular Flash writer Gardner Fox was preoccupied with other projects.\n\nOne non-superhero ongoing character introduced in \"Comic Cavalcade\" was newspaperman Johnny Peril. His roots, prior to his first appearance, came in the one-off story \"Just a Story\" in issue #15 (July 1946), by writer-artist Howard Purcell. With issue #22 (Sept. 1947), the anthological \"Just a Story\" series gained Peril as, generally, a witness or narrator rather than as an integral part of the narrative. With this issue, the series title became \"Johnny Peril Tells Just a Story\", eventually changed to \"Johnny Peril's Surprise Story\" as Johnny became the series' two-fisted hero until the series ended with issue #29 (Nov. 1948). The character went on to appear in his own feature in \"All-Star Comics\", \"Danger Trail\" and \"Sensation Comics\" through 1953. He returned in the Silver Age of Comic Books in 1958, in \"The Unexpected\".\n\nInitially published quarterly, the title went bi-monthly beginning with #14 (April–May 1946). It was revamped completely with #30 (December–January 1948), becoming a funny-animal humor book when superheroes faded from popularity in the post-war era. Featured were animator Frank Tashlin's movie-cartoon duo \"The Fox and the Crow\", along with cartoonist Woody Gelman's creations, \"The Dodo and the Frog\" and \"Nutsy Squirrel\".

Danish folk dance is mainly a social dance involving groups or groups of couples of dancers, often designed for large gatherings. The dances were supposed to be simple enough for everyone to join in. Danish folk dances are made for social- and educational purposes, generally speaking not for exhibitional purposes.\n\nThe canonized history of Danish folk dance highlights a performance by Philochoros in Copenhagen in 1899 with some Danish students in the audience as a triggering factor. The students were immediately so inspired that they started a folk dance club. In 1901 some of the same students who were now students of gymnastics founded a formal organization, the Danish Association for the Promotion of Folk-Dancing (Foreningen til Folkedansens Fremme). The number of folk dance organizations and societies continued to grow throughout Denmark for the following two decades. Danish Folk-Dancers was established in 1929 and is an organization that still arranges courses for folk dancers, and every year folk dance festivals are organized. The effect of all of this had led to a certain uniformity in the performance of the Danish folk dances, thus reducing regional differences between local dances and traditions within Denmark. These societies and organizations also contributed to help preserve the Danish traditional costume as well as the folk dance.

{"id": "4861797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4861797", "title": "Dramatistic pentad", "text": "Dramatistic pentad\n\nThe dramatistic pentad forms the core structure of dramatism, a method for examining motivations that the renowned literary critic Kenneth Burke developed. Dramatism recommends the use of a metalinguistic approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five rhetorical elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the \"dramatistic pentad.\" Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its characters. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their world view.\n\nBurke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book \"A Grammar of Motives\". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines \"questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when\". Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, \"The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula\".\n\nThe pentad also closely follows the journalistic 'Five Ws': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states \"Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information.\" \n\nThe dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them,\" to read them \"at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other,\" and \"in a wider context than any of them recognizes.\"\n\nAct, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question \"what?\", is related to the world view of realism; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”\n\nScene, which is associated with the setting of an act and answers the questions \"when?\" and \"where?\", is related to the world view of materialism and minimal or non-existent free will. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” \n\nAgent, which answers the question \"by whom?\", reflects the world view of philosophical idealism. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” \n\nAgency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question \"how?\", implies a pragmatic point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”\n\nPurpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question \"why?\", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.\n\nIn A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.\n\nThis is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’\" The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. \nLikewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”\n\nThe rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio).\"\n\nThe scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.” This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.\n\nA relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.\n\nWhile requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.” This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.\n\nIn A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,” remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency. Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element. In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad. Attitude is defined as \"the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act.\" The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”. There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad. While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.” Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.” As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.\n"}

The game is about the titular character, Désiré, an achromatic boy who only sees black and white, and the player guides him in 4 various parts of his life. The game contains themes such as sexuality, bullying, pedophilia, zoophilia, suicide, depression, morality,\nfeminism, BDSM and criticism of aspects of modern society such as capitalism and materialism.\n\nThe game begins with a cutscene of a young Désiré who is asked by his kindergarten teacher why he hasn't drawn the sun like the other children, he replies that he has never seen the sun, since it \"is always night in his head\".\n\nThe actual game starts on a beach in 1992, where a young Désiré wants to cast a \"love spell\" to a classmate he has a crush on. The player directs Désiré in all his actions, and can pick up objects, talk to various characters and explore the world.\nAfter successfully burrying a box with an egg, which has the name of Désiré's crush on it, in it, the game continues to the next chapter.\n\nDésiré, who lives in the suburbs of Lyon with his parents and brother Bruno, is advised by an old man, who is apparently imaginary as other characters imply, to stand up against a boy who bullies him at school, David. Désiré plots to catch David, who has an addiction to masturbating, in the act and distribute pictures of it around the school. After successfully doing this, David and Désiré are both expelled from school.\n\nThe next chapter starts in 2003, Désiré, now an adult man living in Paris, is informed that his company is firing him because they are outsourcing part of its operations. Désiré is in love with Elma, who doesn't seem to return the feeling, and he promises her a gig at a restaurant in an attempt to woo her. After successfully doing this, Elma doesn't show up at the day of the gig, and a heartbroken Désiré comes to believe that it is better not to love.\n\nIn 2011, Désiré has discarded love and instead visits brothels to satisfy his desires. The chapter begins with a dream or hallucination of Désiré standing before a brothel which appears as a giant woman's genital area. Désiré also visits, Élodie, one of his friends who is in love with her dog Rocco. He decides to visit another friend, Damien and recruits the help of Andy, another friend, to find him after discovering threatening letters from Damien's neighbour. Eventually, it turns out Damien committed suicide, and it is also revealed he was a pedophile, but never actually acted on it. The chapter ends with Désiré talking to a hallucination of an obese man who tries to convince him to stop changing society, however corrupt it might be, and just accept everything.\n\nThe final chapter starts in 2020. Désiré has been living a village in Congo for 2 years, but wants to return to France and find the manuscript which an old sailor give him when he was a child. His parents gave the manuscript to a charity, and Désiré returns to Lyon in search of it. A clue in a secondhand shop gives him a lead, but the shop salesman, who is revealed to be David, confronts Désiré, who is forced to beat up the former. Désiré tracks down the manuscript to a small village. He finds a young girl, Léa, alone on the streets and reveals her grandfather is Martin Lacour, an antique collector who currently owns the manuscript. Désiré accompanies Léa back home, and Lacour reluctantly allows Désiré to read the manuscript. After realizing it is the real one, he steals it from Lacour's safe and reads it in the local church. Désiré is now able to see colors, and is ecstatic, but can't bring himself to steal it and decides to return it to Léa, who thanks him. The chapters ends with Désiré hallucinating an apparition of Jesus, who claims Désiré is afraid of change and gave the manuscript away for that reason.\n\nThe game ends with Désiré finally accepting the world as it ends, yet feeling condemned to live while pursuing his path.\n\nReception to the game on Steam was mixed. It was later removed from the Steam Store because the author had created multiple accounts to improve the game's rating. The French gaming website Joypad gave it a positive review. The game was notable enough to receive coverage on a TV report of La Une.\n\nThe game won Best Mobile Game and Best Game Audio at the Tel Aviv Indie Game Awards 2016, and Best Game Narrative in the Asia Indie Game Awards 2016. It also won Best Game Audio in the Évry Games City Awards 2016.\n"}

{"id": "13135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13135", "title": "Game show", "text": "Game show\n\nA game show is a type of radio, television, or stage show in which contestants, individually or as teams, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles, usually for money or prizes. Alternatively, a \"gameshow\" can be a demonstrative program about a game [while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony]. In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers.\n\nGame shows began to appear on radio and television in the late 1930s. The very first television game show, \"Spelling Bee\", as well as the first radio game show, \"Information Please\", were both broadcast in 1938; the first major success in the game show genre was \"Dr. I.Q.\", a radio quiz show that began in 1939. \"Truth or Consequences\" was the first game show to air on commercially licensed television; the \"CBS Television Quiz\" followed shortly thereafter. Its first episode aired in 1941 as an experimental broadcast. Over the course of the 1950s, as television began to pervade the popular culture, game shows quickly became a fixture. Daytime game shows would be played for lower stakes to target stay-at-home housewives. Higher-stakes programs would air in primetime. During the late 1950s, high-stakes games such as \"Twenty-One\" and \"The $64,000 Question\" began a rapid rise in popularity. However, the rise of quiz shows proved to be short-lived. In 1959, many of the higher stakes game shows were discovered to be rigged and ratings declines led to most of the primetime games being canceled.\n\nAn early variant of the game show, the panel game, survived the quiz show scandals. On shows like \"What's My Line?\", \"I've Got A Secret\", and \"To Tell the Truth\", panels of celebrities would interview a guest in an effort to determine some fact about them; in others, celebrities would answer questions. Panel games had success in primetime until the late 1960s, when they were collectively dropped from television because of their perceived low budget nature. Panel games made a comeback in American daytime television (where the lower budgets were tolerated) in the 1970s through comedy-driven shows such as \"Match Game\" and \"Hollywood Squares\". In the UK, commercial demographic pressures were not as prominent, and restrictions on game shows made in the wake of the scandals limited the style of games that could be played and the amount of money that could be awarded. Panel shows there were kept in primetime and have continued to thrive; they have transformed into showcases for the nation's top stand-up comedians on shows such as \"Have I Got News for You\", \"Would I Lie to You?\", \"Mock the Week\", \"QI\", and \"8 Out of 10 Cats\", all of which put a heavy emphasis on comedy, leaving the points as mere formalities. The focus on quick-witted comedians has resulted in strong ratings, which, combined with low costs of production, have only spurred growth in the UK panel show phenomenon.\n\nGame shows remained a fixture of US daytime television through the 1960s after the quiz show scandals. Lower-stakes games made a slight comeback in daytime in the early 1960s; examples include \"Jeopardy!\" which began in 1964 and the original version of \"The Match Game\" first aired in 1962. \"Let's Make a Deal\" began in 1963 and the 1960s also marked the debut of \"Hollywood Squares\", \"Password\", \"The Dating Game\", and \"The Newlywed Game\".\n\nThough CBS gave up on daytime game shows in 1968, the other networks did not follow suit. Color television was introduced to the game show genre in the late 1960s on all three networks. The 1970s saw a renaissance of the game show as new games and massive upgrades to existing games made debuts on the major networks. \"The New Price Is Right\", an update of the 1950s-era game show \"The Price Is Right\", debuted in 1972 and marked CBS's return to the game show format in its effort to draw wealthier, suburban viewers. \"The Match Game\" became \"Big Money\" \"Match Game 73\", which proved popular enough to prompt a spin-off, \"Family Feud\", on ABC in 1976. \"The $10,000 Pyramid\" and its numerous higher-stakes derivatives also debuted in 1973, while the 1970s also saw the return of formerly disgraced producer and host Jack Barry, who debuted \"The Joker's Wild\" and a clean version of the previously rigged \"Tic-Tac-Dough\" in the 1970s. \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on NBC in 1975. The Prime Time Access Rule, which took effect in 1971, barred networks from broadcasting in the 7-8 p.m. time slot immediately preceding prime time, opening up time slots for syndicated programming. Most of the syndicated programs were \"nighttime\" adaptations of network daytime game shows. These game shows originally aired once a week, but by the late 1970s and early 1980s most of the games had transitioned to five days a week.\n\nGame shows were the lowest priority of television networks and were rotated out every thirteen weeks if unsuccessful. Most tapes were destroyed until the early 1980s. Over the course of the late 1980s and early 1990s, as fewer new hits were produced, game shows lost their permanent place in the daytime lineup. ABC transitioned out of the daytime game show format in the mid-1980s (briefly returning to the format for one season in 1990 with a \"Match Game\" revival). NBC's game block also lasted until 1991, but the network attempted to bring them back in 1993 before cancelling its game show block again in 1994. CBS phased out most of its game shows, except for \"The Price Is Right\", by 1993. To the benefit of the genre, the moves of \"Wheel of Fortune\" and a modernized revival of \"Jeopardy!\" to syndication in 1983 and 1984, respectively, was and remains highly successful; the two are, to this day, fixtures in the prime time \"access period\".\n\nCable television also allowed for the debut of game shows such as \"Supermarket Sweep\" (Lifetime), \"Trivial Pursuit\" and \"Family Challenge\" (Family Channel), and \"Double Dare\" (Nickelodeon). It also opened up a previously underdeveloped market for game show reruns. General interest networks such as CBN Cable Network and USA Network had popular blocks for game show reruns from the mid-1980s to the mid-'90s before that niche was overtaken by Game Show Network in 1994.\n\nAfter the popularity of game shows hit a nadir in the mid-1990s United States (at which point \"The Price Is Right\" was the only game show still on daytime network TV), the British game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" began distribution across the globe. Upon the show's American debut in 1999, it was a hit and became a regular part of ABC's prime time lineup until 2002. Several shorter-lived high-stakes games were attempted around the time of the millennium, both in the United States and the United Kingdom, such as \"Winning Lines\", \"The Chair\", \"Greed\", and \"Shafted\", leading to some dubbing this period as \"The Million-Dollar Game Show Craze\". These higher stakes contests also opened the door to reality television contests such as \"Survivor\" and \"Big Brother\", in which contestants win large sums of money for outlasting their peers in a given environment. Several game shows returned to daytime in syndication during this time as well, such as \"Family Feud\", \"Hollywood Squares\", and \"Millionaire\".\n\nThe popularity of game shows in the United States was closely paralleled around the world. Reg Grundy Organisation, for instance, would buy the international rights for American game shows and reproduce them in other countries, especially in Grundy's native Australia. In the United Kingdom, game shows have had a more steady and permanent place in the television lineup and never lost popularity in the 1990s as they did in the United States, due in part to the fact that game shows were highly regulated by the Independent Broadcasting Authority in the 1980s and that those restrictions were lifted in the 1990s, allowing for higher-stakes games to be played. Game shows have had an inconsistent place in Canadian television, with most homegrown game shows there being made for the French-speaking Quebecois market and the majority of English-language game shows in the country being rebroadcast from, or made with the express intent of export to, the United States. There have been exceptions to this (see, for instance, the long-running \"Definition\"). Unlike reality television franchises, international game show franchises generally only see Canadian adaptations in a series of specials, based heavily on the American versions but usually with a Canadian host to allow for Canadian content credits. The smaller markets and lower revenue opportunities for Canadian shows in general also affect game shows there, with Canadian games (especially Quebecois ones) often having very low budgets for prizes, unless the series is made for export. Canadian contestants are generally allowed to participate on American game shows, and there have been at least three Canadian game show hosts – Monty Hall, Jim Perry, and Alex Trebek – who have gone on to long careers hosting American series.\n\nIn the U.S., CBS is currently the only major network airing daily national game shows. It still airs \"The Price Is Right\" and, as of 2009, is also airing a revival of \"Let's Make a Deal\". \"Deal\" airs on weekdays at a time chosen by each CBS affiliate, while \"Price\" airs weekdays at 10 am or 11 am in most markets. In addition, ABC's syndication wing Disney-ABC Domestic Television distributes \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\", and many of their local affiliates air it in syndication. The oldest, continually aired radio quiz show in the United States was \"Simply Trivia\", which aired on public radio station WYSO in Yellow Springs, Ohio. It ran from 1972 through 2014.\n\nThe rise of digital television in the United States opened up a large market for rerun programs. Buzzr was established by FremantleMedia North America, owners of numerous classic U.S. game shows, as a broadcast outlet for its archived holdings in June 2015. There has also been a rise of live game shows at festivals and public venues, where the general audience can participate in the show, such as the science-inspired \"Geek Out Game Show\" or the \"Yuck Show\".\n\nA boom in prime time revivals of classic daytime game shows began to emerge in the mid-2010s. In 2016, ABC packaged the existing \"Celebrity Family Feud\", which had returned in 2015, with new versions of \"To Tell the Truth,\" \"The $100,000 Pyramid\", and \"Match Game\" in 2016. TBS, in turn, launched a marijuana-themed revival of \"The Joker's Wild\", hosted by Snoop Dogg, in October 2017. This is in addition to a number of original game concepts that appeared near the same time, including \"The Million Second Quiz\", \"Hollywood Game Night\", \"1 vs. 100\", and \"The Wall\", and a string of music-themed games such as \"Don't Forget the Lyrics!\", \"The Singing Bee\", and \"Beat Shazam\".\n\nMany of the prizes awarded on game shows are provided through product placement, but in some cases they are provided by private organizations or purchased at either the full price or at a discount by the show. There is the widespread use of \"promotional consideration\", in which a game show receives a subsidy from an advertiser in return for awarding that manufacturer's product as a prize or consolation prize. Some products supplied by manufacturers may not be intended to be awarded at all and are instead just used as part of the gameplay (such as the low-priced items used in several pricing games of \"The Price Is Right\").\n\nFor high-stakes games, a network may purchase prize indemnity insurance to avoid paying the cost of a rare but expensive prize out of pocket. If the said prize is won too often, the insurance company may refuse to insure a show. (This was a factor in the discontinuation of \"The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular\" series of prime-time specials.) In 2008, three of the contestants on \"The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular\" won the top prize in a five-episode span after fifteen episodes without a winner, due in large part to a change in the rules. The insurance companies had made it extremely difficult to get further insurance for the remaining episodes. A network or syndicator may also opt to distribute large cash prizes in the form of an annuity, spreading the cost of the prize out over several years or decades.\n\nFrom about 1960 through the rest of the 20th century, American networks placed restrictions on the amount of money that could be given away on a game show, in an effort to avoid a repeat of the scandals of the 1950s. This usually took the form of an earnings cap that forced a player to retire once they had won a certain amount of money or a limit on how many episodes, usually five, on which a player could appear on a show. The introduction of syndicated games, particularly in the 1980s, eventually allowed for more valuable prizes and extended runs on a particular show. British television was under even stricter regulations on prizes until the 1990s, seriously restricting the value of prizes that could be given and disallowing games of chance to have an influence on the results of the game. (Thus, the British version of \"The Price Is Right\" at first did not include the American version's \"Showcase Showdown\", in which contestants spun a large wheel to determine who would advance to the Showcase bonus round.) In Canada, prizes were limited not by bureaucracy but necessity, as the much smaller population limited the audience of shows marketed toward that country. The lifting of these restrictions in the 1990s was a major factor in the explosion of high-stakes game shows in the later part of that decade in both the U.S. and Britain and, subsequently, around the world.\n\nA bonus round (also known as a bonus game or an end game) usually follows a main game as a bonus to the winner of that game. In the bonus round, the stakes are higher and the game is considered to be tougher.\n\nThe game play of a bonus round usually varies from the standard game play of the front game, and there are often borrowed or related elements of the main game in the bonus round to ensure the entire show has a unified premise. Though some end games are referred to as \"bonus rounds\", many are not specifically referred to as such in games but fit the same general role.\n\nThere is no one formula for the format of a bonus round. There are differences in almost every bonus round, though there are many recurring elements from show to show. The bonus round is often played for the show's top prize.\n\nUntil the 1960s, most game shows did not offer a bonus round. In traditional two-player formats, the winner — if a game show's rules provided for this — became the champion and simply played a new challenger either on the next show or after the commercial break.\n\nOne of the earliest forms of bonus rounds was the Jackpot Round of the original series \"Beat the Clock\". After two rounds of performing stunts, the wife of the contestant couple would perform at a jackpot board for a prize. The contestant was shown a famous quotation or common phrase, and the words were scrambled. To win the announced bonus, the contestant had to unscramble the words within 20 seconds. The contestant received a consolation gift worth over $200 if she was unsuccessful.\n\nAnother early bonus round ended each episode of \"You Bet Your Life\" with the team who won the most money answering one final question for a jackpot which started at $1,000 and increased $500 each week until won.\n\nAnother early example was the Lightning Round on the word game \"Password\", starting in 1961. The contestant who won the front game played a quick-fire series of passwords within 60 seconds, netting $50 per correctly guessed word, for a maximum bonus prize of $250.\n\nThe bonus round came about after game show producer Mark Goodson was first presented \"Password\", contending that it was not enough to merely guess passwords during the show. \"We needed something more, and that's how the Lightning Round was invited,\" said Howard Felsher, who produced \"Password\" and \"Family Feud\". \"From that point on every game show had to have an end round. You'd bring a show to a network and they'd say, 'What's the endgame?' as if they had thought of it themselves.\"\n\nThe end game of \"Match Game\", hosted for most of its run by Gene Rayburn, served as the impetus for a completely new game show. The first part of \"Match Game\"s \"Super-Match\" bonus round, called the \"Audience Match\", asked contestants to guess how a studio audience responded to a question. In 1975, with then regular panelist Richard Dawson becoming restless and progressively less cooperative, Goodson decided that this line of questioning would make a good game show of its own, and the concept eventually became \"Family Feud\", as whose inaugural host Dawson was hired.\n\n\n"}

His 1983 play \"The Arrangement\" was described as \"the most disturbing bedsitcom since Polanski's \"The Tenant\"\" by \"Time Out\" magazine.\n\nDay's first play, \"The Rocking Chair\", was performed at the Fountains Abbey pub theatre in Paddington, and directed by Murray Shelmerdine. The two-hander revolves around Gary, a reclusive would-be writer, whose peace of mind is rudely interrupted by a new neighbour, who starts off making unwelcome advances. When he tries to borrow Gary's rocking chair in which to commit suicide, the play develops into a two-edged study of selfishness. Subsequently, adapted for radio, it aired on BBC Radio Four's \"Thirty Minute Theatre\" in 1983, directed by David Johnston and featuring John Rye and Richard Huw.\n\nDay's 1984 play \"Tenderhooks\" follows the lives of three flatmates fixated on the same woman, and explored the \"surrealism of unprivate lives\". Although never produced as a stand-alone play, \"Tenderhooks\" was later staged as part of \"Changing Rooms\" at the Odyssey Theatre, an umbrella title for three of Day's plays - \"The Rocking Chair\", \"Tenderhooks\" and \"The Arrangement\", each one examining games of sex and power in \"bedsit land\". The plays were directed by David Robson.\n\nThe 1984 production \"Behind The Clouds\" explored the \"cloudy\" personal life of Socrates, ending with his trial for seducing young men, in particular Alcibiades. The play explored the power struggles and intrigues of ancient Athens.\n\nDay's 1986 play \"Bust\" is on the subject of the gender gap, and traces a young man's journey into womanhood - a situation which places him on the front line in 'the battle of the sexes'. In 1991 it was performed in German as \"Titten\" at the Theater Chambinzky in Wurzberg. After being rewritten and retitled as \"Stripped\" the play was performed at London's Riverside Studios in 1998, centring on Leslie and Zoe, an American couple visiting London. After a row that leads to them splitting up, Leslie starts to realise that everyone believes him to be a woman. What follows is a struggle for sexual identity and the forming of new kinds of relationships. Kevin Day described it as a \"genuinely black comedy\" and the Daily Mail called it a \"genuine fringe find\". \"Bust\" and \"Stripped\" were both directed by Tony Craven.\n\n"}

Raiders of the End of the World) is a 1983 American adventure-romance film set in the 1920s starring Tom Selleck in his first major starring role, playing a hard-drinking biplane pilot hired by society heiress Eve \"Evie\" Tozer (Bess Armstrong) to find her missing father (Wilford Brimley). The supporting cast includes Robert Morley and Brian Blessed. The Golden Harvest film (released by Warner Bros.) is loosely based on a novel of the same name by Jon Cleary. However, little beyond character names and the basic premise of an aerial race to China survived the translation to film.\n\nWhile Brian G. Hutton ended up as the final director, originally, \"High Road to China\" was helmed by John Huston, before being replaced by Sidney J. Furie. The musical score was composed by John Barry. It was the 27th highest-grossing film of 1983, bringing in $28,445,927 at the domestic box office.\nEve Tozer (Bess Armstrong) is a society heiress and flapper living the high-life in 1920s Istanbul. She needs to find her father, Bradley Tozer (Wilford Brimley), before he is officially declared dead or risk losing her inheritance to his scheming business partner, Bentik (Robert Morley). She only has 12 days. Eve hires World War I ace pilot Patrick O'Malley (Tom Selleck) and his aircraft. O'Malley is eager to take the job as he needs to leave town rather urgently himself. Eve, also an accomplished pilot, however, is determined to accompany him in his other aircraft, which causes the first of many arguments on the way from Istanbul and China.\n\nTheir journey in two biplanes (named \"Dorothy\" and \"Lillian\" after the famous Gish silent film star sisters) through six countries leads them to finally find the eccentric Bradley Tozer in China, where he is helping a small village defend itself against a local warlord. O'Malley and Eve help them win the final battle, but their one remaining aircraft is damaged in the process, leaving her seemingly unable to meet her deadline.\n\n\"High Road to China\" is regarded as one of the better 'imitators' that populated movie theaters in the years following \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" however, as in the case of Romancing the Stone, another so-called 'imitator', the source material actually predated the aforementioned Lucasfilm production by four years. Rumor has it that it was \"given\" to Selleck as a sort of consolation prize for having to pass on \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" due to scheduling conflicts with \"Magnum, P.I.\"\n\nIn early development, the film was slated to star Roger Moore and Jacqueline Bisset under the direction of John Huston. Then Huston and Bissett dropped out and Bo Derek was to co star with Moore. The budget was to be $16 million. Then Derek dropped out because she only wanted to be directed by her husband.\n\nFilming for \"High Road to China\" took place in Yugoslavia with a crew of 231 (145 Yugoslavs, 60 British, 15 Italians, 10 Americans, and one Frenchman). They also added 50 Yugoslav actors to the speaking cast and hired 4,000 extras. Headquarters for the film company was in the small Adriatic coastal town of Opatija, Croatia, located on the northwest coast of the Gulf of Rijeka at the foot of Mt. Ucka. It was filmed in Opatija and Istria, Croatia. Scenes set in Afghanistan were shot at Kamenjak near Rijeka, while scenes set in Turkey were filmed at Volosko, and the final battle in China was shot in Boljun.\n\nOriginally, Bristol F2B replicas were built by Vernon Ohmert of Ypsilanti, Michigan. This aircraft type was in the novel, but after construction, the replicas were thought to be dangerous to fly at high altitude and were replaced by two Stampe SV-4 biplanes, (G-AZGC and G-AZGE), provided by Bianchi Aviation Film Services.\n\n\"High Road to China\" was the only new wide release on the March 18–20 weekend, and debuted atop the box office with $6,156,049. It eventually grossed over $28 million domestically.\n\nTom Selleck later recalled:\nPatrick O'Malley I'm very fond of ... There were actors at that point who had left a series and started a feature career, but there was no one at that point who was trying to do both at the same time. So that was unique. It also made the jury rather tough, because a lot of people didn't see it that way, so I was walking into an arena where that wasn't accepted. But it's a good movie. It holds up.\n\n\"Aerofiles\", a historical aviation website, considered the film as \"Strictly mediocre, with substandard action scenes and the flattest dialogue this side of the Great Wall.\" Aviation film historian Christian Santoir described the film thusly: \"Arriving two years after 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Raiders of the End of the World' was in the same vein, despite certain missing qualities. This, however, could have been the start of another 'Indiana Jones'–type franchise.\" Film historian Stephen Pendo found \"High Road to China\" \"... notable mainly for its aviation sequences, for it lacks character and plot development.\"\n\n\"High Road to China\" was nominated for the 1984 Saturn Award as Best Fantasy Film, while Bess Armstrong was nominated as Best Actress at the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films Festival.\n\n\"High Road to China\" was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in February 2012. In February 2013, Umbrella Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray.\n\n"}

Prominent actors or filmmakers may use their negotiating power to insist on such provisions.

In 2006, she was a contestant in the 2006 WWE Diva Search, which she won to earn a contract with the company.\n\nInitially appearing on the SmackDown brand, she moved to ECW in January 2007. There, she formed the Extreme Exposé dance troupe with Kelly Kelly and Brooke Adams. In 2008, she was drafted to the Raw brand, where she began managing William Regal. The following year she returned to SmackDown and formed an alliance with Michelle McCool known as LayCool. In May 2010, Layla won the WWE Women's Championship for the first time. She is the first British woman and the first Diva Search winner to hold the championship, and was the final champion as the title was retired in 2010. In April 2012, Layla won the WWE Divas Championship upon her return from a year-long absence due to injury, and held the championship until September that year. She retired in 2015.\n\nEl was born and raised in London, England, and is of Spanish and Moroccan descent. She attended a performing arts college in London.\n\nEl was a dancer for Carnival Cruise Lines. Afterward she joined the National Basketball Association's Miami Heat franchise, where she danced for two years beginning in 2004. As part of the Miami Heat dance troupe, she received a championship ring. During this time, she appeared on-stage with John Legend as one of his backup dancers. She also danced for P. Diddy and Kanye West at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nEl's first foray into professional wrestling occurred when her trainer suggested she try out for the $250,000 \"Diva Search\" contest in 2006. After a casting call, she was selected as one of the finalists. During the contest, she won a week's worth of immunity from elimination on the 14 July episode of \"SmackDown!\", by winning Sgt. Slaughter's \"Diva Boot Camp\" obstacle course. She won another competition, the \"Diva Search Talent Show\" on 11 August, when she danced dressed as a police officer. El won the Diva Search competition on 16 August.\n\nShe made her first official WWE appearance at the 2006 SummerSlam pay-per-view in a backstage segment with several other Divas. During the segment, the other women initially taunted and teased her before revealing that \"it was all in fun\" and part of an \"initiation\". The week after SummerSlam, El made her debut as a member of the SmackDown! brand in an interview with Mike \"The Miz\" Mizanin—although he did not allow her the chance to say much, spending most of the time talking about himself. Subsequently, she did not appear on television for almost a month, reappearing on the 22 September episode of \"SmackDown!\" and getting into a confrontation with Kristal and Jillian Hall.\n\nAt October's No Mercy pay-per-view event, she embarrassed The Miz by tricking him into getting a lap dance from Big Dick Johnson while he was blindfolded and expecting it to be from her as a birthday gift. On 20 October, Layla participated in a dance contest with the other SmackDown! Divas, and was chosen as the winner by the judges, Nick and Aaron Carter. Despite this, The Miz, who was acting as emcee, declared Kristal the winner. The following week, Layla made her in-ring debut in a Diva's \"Trick-or-Treat\" battle royal. The match ended in controversial fashion when she was pulled from the ring apron by The Miz, allowing Kristal to win. The following week, Layla teamed with Big Vito in a loss to The Miz and Kristal in a mixed tag team match. Continuing to feud with Kristal, Layla had her singles match debut on the 1 December episode of \"SmackDown!\", when she lost to Kristal. In her final match for the SmackDown! brand, Layla teamed with Ashley to defeat Kristal and Jillian Hall in a tag team match on 22 December.\n\nThe following month, Layla was moved to the ECW brand, debuting on 23 January 2007. She joined Brooke and Kelly Kelly to form Extreme Exposé. The trio performed a weekly dance segment on \"ECW\", choreographed by Layla, for the next several months. In June 2007, The Miz was moved to the brand, prompting a storyline in which all three members of Extreme Exposé were attracted to him. When Kelly shifted her attentions towards Balls Mahoney, Layla, Brooke, and Miz openly mocked her, turning Layla and Brooke into villainous characters in the process. On 1 November, Brooke was released from her WWE contract, and Extreme Exposé dissolved as a group, leaving Kelly and Layla to enter an ongoing rivalry with more active in-ring roles. They were on opposite sides of a 10-Diva tag team match at Survivor Series, which Layla's team lost. In December, Layla formed an alliance with Victoria, which expanded to include Lena Yada in January 2008, and the trio continued to feud with Kelly. At WrestleMania XXIV, Layla was a lumberjill for the Divas' tag team lumberjill match. The following month, Layla was part of the winning team in a six-on-six Divas match at the Backlash pay-per-view.\n\nAs part of the 2008 supplemental draft in late June, Layla was drafted to the Raw brand. On the 7 July episode of \"Raw\", Layla made her debut in a tag team match with Jillian Hall, losing to Mickie James and Kelly Kelly, the latter of whom had been revealed as the newest member of the Raw brand earlier that night. She soon entered a storyline with Jamie Noble in which Noble attempted to impress her with his matches, only to be squashed—easily defeated—by his opponents. On 1 September, Noble was able to defeat William Regal, which impressed Layla. The following week, however, Layla chose to align herself with Regal, after he defeated Noble in a rematch. On the following episode of \"Raw\", Layla reinforced her decision, telling Noble that she had finally found a worthy man in Regal. Over the next few months, Layla competed only sporadically in matches, spending most of her time managing Regal, and was present at ringside when Regal defeated Santino Marella on 10 November to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship. On 5 April, Layla competed in a Divas battle royal at WrestleMania XXV, but the match was won by Santina Marella.\n\nOn 15 April 2009, Layla was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. She began a feud with Eve Torres, and lost both a dance contest and an arm wrestling match, before losing a match to her on the 29 May episode of \"SmackDown\". After Torres defeated Layla again on \"WWE Superstars\" on 18 June, the two shook hands.\nShe then formed an alliance with Michelle McCool, later called LayCool. They began a scripted feud with Mickie James in October, mocking of her weight and vowing to make her leave SmackDown. At the Survivor Series pay-per-view, McCool's team lost to James' team. At , Layla interfered in the WWE Women's Championship match between McCool and James and helped McCool retain the title. In January 2010, at Royal Rumble, Layla came out in a fatsuit, mocking James prior to the title match between McCool and James; however, the mockery backfired, as James attacked Layla and used that as a distraction to quickly defeat McCool to win the championship. On the 12 February episode of \"SmackDown\", Layla and McCool defeated James in a handicap match made by Official SmackDown Consultant Vickie Guerrero, who had been accidentally humiliated by James backstage. Guerrero then began managing LayCool, accompanying them to the ring and regularly interfering in their matches. At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Layla and McCool defeated Raw's Gail Kim and Maryse in an inter-brand Divas tag team match. At WrestleMania XXVI she was on the winning team in a 10-Diva tag team match.\n\nLayCool faced the WWE Women's Champion Beth Phoenix in a two-on-one handicap match on the 14 May episode of \"SmackDown\". Layla pinned Phoenix to win the Women's Championship for the first time, becoming the first British woman to hold the title. She is also the first \"Diva Search\" winner to have won the championship. Following her win, LayCool began calling themselves the co-Women's Champions. On 1 June, it was announced that LayCool would be mentoring Kaval during the second season of \"NXT\". On 18 July, Layla had her first title defense when she defeated Kelly Kelly at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view. On 30 July, SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long informed LayCool there was only one Women's Champion, and they had a week to decide who it would be. The following week, LayCool revealed that they had cut the title belt into two, turning it into a friendship charm and circumventing Long's orders. In September, Layla and McCool challenged WWE Divas Champion Melina to a championship unification match at Night of Champions. McCool participated in the match and won, with Layla's help, to unify both title into the WWE Unified Divas Championship. Layla unofficially became the co-champion, and defended the title against Melina the following night on \"Raw\". After both members of LayCool had successfully defended the title against Natalya, they faced her in a two-on-one handicap match at Survivor Series, which Natalya won to become the new Divas Champion. Following Survivor Series, Natalya and Phoenix formed an alliance to continue the feud with LayCool, and at the in December, LayCool lost to them in the first Diva's tag team tables match in WWE. LayCool invoked their rematch clause in January 2011, prompting the scheduling of a two-on-one handicap match for the Royal Rumble. At the event however, the anonymous Raw General Manager altered the match to a fatal four-way, also involving Eve Torres who went to win the title.\n\nDissension between Layla and McCool began to show following the loss of the Divas Championship, and the two appeared in a series of vignettes in which they were attending couples therapy. On the 22 April episode of \"SmackDown\", McCool attacked Layla during one of their storyline therapy sessions. During the 2011 WWE Draft on 25 April, Layla lost a match to Eve and was attacked afterward by McCool, but was able to fight her off. On 29 April, the pair faced each other in a match, which ended in a double countout. As a result, the pair faced each other in a no countout, no disqualification, loser leaves WWE match at Extreme Rules on 1 May, which Layla won.\n\nLayla announced that she had suffered a knee injury at Extreme Rules on \"SmackDown\" on 13 May, and was interrupted and attacked by Kharma to write her off television. Later that month, it was confirmed that Layla had legitimately torn both her Anterior cruciate and Medial collateral ligaments, and required surgery.\n\nLayla made her in-ring return at a Florida Championship Wrestling event on 22 March 2012. She made her return to the main WWE roster at the Extreme Rules pay-per-view on 29 April, replacing Beth Phoenix, who was not medically cleared to compete, in a match for the WWE Divas Championship. Despite interference from Brie Bella, Layla defeated Nikki Bella to win the WWE Divas Championship for the first time. Her victory made her the first \"Diva Search\" winner to won both the Divas and the Women's championship. The following night on \"Raw\", she successfully defended the championship against both Nikki and Brie in a triple threat match, and retained twice against Beth Phoenix at the Over the Limit and No Way Out pay-per-views in May and June respectively. On the 20 August episode of \"Raw\", Kaitlyn won a battle royal to become the number one contender to Layla's Divas Championship. At Night of Champions, Kaitlyn was removed from the championship match following a storyline injury and replaced with Eve Torres. Torres defeated Layla to win the championship.\n\nLayla defeated Torres in a non-title match on \"Superstars\" to earn a title match. She unsuccessfully challenged for the championship on 15 October, and failed again to regain the championship in a three-way match at Hell in a Cell, which also involved Kaitlyn. On 12 November, on \"Raw\", Layla was defeated by Kaitlyn in a number one contenders match for the championship. On 16 December at the pay-per-view, Layla competed in a number one contender's \"Santa's Little Helpers\" battle royal to face Torres for the championship, but was unsuccessful in winning the match. In early 2013, Layla briefly developed a feud with Tamina Snuka, losing to her in singles matches before defeating her in a tag team match. As part of the feud, Layla allied herself with Kaitlyn, and began accompanying her to ringside. On the 2 August episode of \"SmackDown\", Layla became a villainess when she stopped Kaitlyn from spearing AJ Lee, costing Kaitlyn both the match and the Divas Championship, and left with AJ. Layla went on to defeat Kaitlyn in singles competition and in a tag team match with AJ as her partner.\nIn late 2013, Layla took a hiatus from WWE due to ongoing personal issues. She returned at a non-televised event on 14 March 2014, and made her television return the following week on an episode of \"Main Event\", where she and Alicia Fox lost to The Funkadactyls (Naomi and Cameron). Layla participated in the Divas Invitational match for the WWE Divas Championship at WrestleMania XXX which was won by AJ.\n\nThe following week, she replaced Summer Rae as Fandango's dancer and valet, and quickly became embroiled in a feud with Emma and Santino Marella. In May, Layla entered a tournament to determine the new NXT Women's Champion, but lost to Natalya in the first round. Rae returned on 19 May, attacking Layla. Competing over Fandango's affections, Layla and Rae repeatedly attacked each other, prompting a match at Money in the Bank with Fandango as the special guest referee; Layla won the match. During a rematch in July on \"SmackDown\", Layla and Rae attacked Fandango, before dancing with each other. Starting at Battleground, the pair formed an alliance, distracting Fandango during his matches and causing him to lose. In their first match as a team, Layla and Rae, now calling themselves the Slayers, lost to Paige and AJ Lee on the 18 July episode of \"SmackDown\". The Slayers won their first match as a team on \"Main Event\" on 2 September, where they defeated Rosa Mendes and Natalya. The Slayers were part of Team Paige at Survivor Series in November, but both were eliminated and their team lost the match.\n\nIn January 2015, El underwent surgery for unknown reasons. Layla returned on the 14 April episode of \"Main Event\", where she defeated Emma in a singles match. On the 13 June episode of \"WWE Superstars\", Layla lost to Paige in what would be her final televised match. On 29 July, WWE announced that Layla had decided to retire from professional wrestling, confirming her release from the company.\n\nSince winning the Diva Search contest El has also done some modelling work. She has been featured in the magazines \"King\", \"Smooth\", and was the cover-girl for the first issue of \"Liquid\". She also posed for \"FHM\" with the other members of Extreme Exposé. Layla, along with Beth Phoenix and Candice Michelle, appeared in the February 2009 issue of \"Flex Magazine\".\n\nIn April 2007, El and several other WWE Divas appeared in the music video for \"Throw It On Me\" by Timbaland and The Hives. During the week of 5 November 2007, she appeared on five episodes of \"Family Feud\" with other WWE wrestlers. On 6 February 2008 she appeared on \"Project Runway\" with several WWE Divas as part of the week's challenge. El also appeared on the 13 April 2008 episode of \"Celebrity Fit Club Boot Camp\" as a trainer. She appeared as a guest judge on an episode of \"Cupcake Wars\" alongside Alicia Fox.\n\nIn 2012, she ranked number 95 in \"Maxim\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Hot 100.\n\nEl has previously lived in Miami, Florida, and Los Angeles, California. El's mother died in August 2008 at the age of 48 due to breast cancer. El's mother had battled it three times in two decades. In October 2012, El appeared in a commercial from the WWE and Susan G. Komen for the Cure to promote awareness for finding a cure for breast cancer. El incorporated infinity symbols on her wrestling attire as a tribute to her mother.\n\nOn 28 July 2015, El announced her engagement to Richard Young, and the two were married on 27 November.\n\n\n"}

Mango TV was established on May 26, 2006 in Changsha, Hunan and later decided to use 'Mango TV(Internet TV, PC, Phone and Pad)' as its video platform branding title in 2008. Mango TV specializes in creating online videos and is an online platform providing all of the content that is presented in TV channels, and all other copyright works from Hunan Broadcasting System and Hunan Satellite TV. Its current headquarter is located in Golden Eagle Movie&TV Cultural City, Changsha, Hunan, China. Mango TV provides audience with all kinds of content including films, TV series, music, cartoons and entertainment.\n\nOn April 31, 2016, Mango TV was reported to have 39 million daily active users on its website, with the content from Hunan Satellite TV only accounting for 38% in all that Mango TV has produced.\n\nOn May 9, 2018, the license which Hunan Broadcasting System got to broadcast the Eurovision Song Contest was taken away after it was revealed that Mango TV, which broadcast Eurovision 2018 for Chinese audiences, censored the Albanian and Irish performances, along with censoring any rainbow flags which were seen in the audience.\n\nMango TV was established on May 26, 2006, in Changsha, Hunan by Ruobo Zhang, the former Mango TV Chairman&CEO. On April 20, 2014, the original Mango TV and Golden Eagle website were integrated into a single online video platform which exclusively holds all of Hunan Broadcasting System and Hunan Satellite TV's content and enjoys their copyright works, also known as \"Mango Exclusive Broadcast\". In October 2014, Mango TV created the first self-produced web series 'Huayang Jianghu'. On 2014 New Year Countdown Night, held by Hunan Satellite TV, Mango TV launched five-screen live broadcast mode, allowing audience to select different camera positions and angles to watch the celebration show.\n\nIn 2015, Mango TV has experienced a shift from 'Exclusive Broadcast' to 'Unique Content', during which period the number of users has increased to 60 million on the platform. In October 2015, Mango TV built collaboration and signed a memorandum with BBC World, seeking for more opportunities on co-production in the global market.\n\nMango TV originals refers to work or content that are produced by Mango TV itself, compared to a large proportion of content that it exclusively broadcasts from Hunan Satellite TV.\nIn October 2014, Mango TV's first self-produced network drama 'Huayang Jianghu' debuted, which featured ancient Chinese world as well as costumes and starred young idols. In late 2014, Mango TV produced the second drama 'Jinpai Hongniang'. The drama featured fixed cast compared to previous network dramas which preferred to take each episode with different actors.\nIn 2015, Mango TV produced the first interactive network live show 'Perfect Holiday', featuring normal young participants living in the same house. The production used multi-positioned cameras which enabled audience to watch the show with different angles of rooms. Later in July 2016, 'Perfect Holiday 2' debuted with more rooms in different themes. It added new IP cameras that would follow the participants all the time, which increased the sense of entertainment.\n\nLater in 2015, Mango TV introduced 'the Million Second Quiz' from NBC, hosted by Kevin Tsai. Keeping the main sections of the show, Mango TV added new online interactive Q&A section.\n\nIn 2016, sponsored exclusively by JD.com, Mango TV produced 'Crime Scene'. It is originated from Korea show and featured content in both thrill and humor.\n\nWith 'Mango Exclusive Broadcast', Mango TV provides all the content from Hunan Satellite TV exclusively. Some of the notable shows are as follow:\n\n\nMango Hi Q is a HD IPTV set-top box(STB) which enables users to request TV programs, movies, music and games. \n\nUsers can enjoy all the copyright works of Hunan Satellite TV and Mango TV provided by the box. Also, they can use Mobile App Wechat to search video content and watch it on their television.\nOn June 23, 2016, Mango TV has completed series B funding with nearly 1.5 billion.\n\nIts estimated value now is 13.5 billion and was planning to go public in 2016. But the plan failed and Mango TV ended up in being included into Happigo Home Shopping Co. Ltd, going public with other six companies.\n\nCritics stated that it would be better for Mango TV to obtain fully controlled operating authority. With Hunan Broadcasting System owning more than 50% shares, it's hard for Mango TV to make decisions all by itself.\n\nIn May 2018, during the Eurovision's performance of Irish singers, Mango TV allegedly blurred and censored gay love symbols such as a kiss and LGBT flags, resulting in the Eurovision administration ending contract with the Chinese TV channel.\n\n"}

{"id": "1867960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867960", "title": "Medicine show", "text": "Medicine show\n\nMedicine shows were touring acts (traveling by truck, horse, or wagon teams) that peddled \"miracle cure\" patent medicines and other products between various entertainments. They developed from European mountebank shows and were common in the United States in the nineteenth century, especially in the Old West (though some continued until World War II). They usually promoted \"miracle elixirs\" (sometimes referred to as snake oil), which, it was claimed, had the ability to cure disease, smooth wrinkles, remove stains, prolong life or cure any number of common ailments. Most shows had their own patent medicine (these medicines were for the most part unpatented but took the name to sound official). Entertainments often included a freak show, a flea circus, musical acts, magic tricks, jokes, or storytelling. Each show was run by a man posing as a doctor who drew the crowd with a monologue. The entertainers, such as acrobats, musclemen, magicians, dancers, ventriloquists, exotic performers, and trick shots, kept the audience engaged until the salesman sold his medicine.\n\nWhile showmen pitching miraculous cures have been around since classical times, the advent of mixed performance and medicine sales in western culture originated during the Dark Ages in Europe after circuses and theatres were banned and performers had only the marketplace or patrons for support. Mountebanks traveled through small towns and large cities, selling miraculous elixirs by offering small street shows and miraculous cures. Itinerant peddlers of dubious medicines appeared in the American colonies before 1772, when legislation prohibiting their activities was enacted. Increasingly elaborate performances were developed to appeal to a largely rural population.\n\nOver the course of the nineteenth century, traveling mountebanks gave way to more polished medicine shows, which availed themselves of a burgeoning patent medicine industry. At least 1,500 patent medicines were recorded by 1858, affording enterprising drifters a specific product to sell. These \"medicines\" seldom treated the specific symptoms of an illness, instead relying on stimulants or other drugs to produce a pleasurable effect. Alcohol, opium and cocaine were typical ingredients, and their addictive qualities provided an additional incentive for consumers to continue buying them, while their supposed medicinal benefit afforded a sufficient excuse. By 1900, the patent medicine industry was an $80 million business. Also contributing to the rise of the medicine show was the expansion of the advertising industry, through which shows were able to procure inexpensive posters, fliers, handbills, and other merchandising to promote their products. Other forms of advertising included the use of memorable jingles, sensational testimonials, and scare tactics.\n\nMedicine shows combined various forms of popular entertainment with sales pitches from a self-proclaimed \"doctor\" who sold an astounding cure-all medicine or device. Shows played either outdoors from a wagon, platform or tent, or indoors in a theatre or opera hall. Admission was usually free or nominal. Pitchmen would make grandiose claims about their product’s efficacy, sometimes planting testimonials in the audience. The speaker's goal was to create a need, or fear, then offer his unique medicine as the only cure. Alternating entertainment with sales pitches wore down the audience's resistance, until the crowd was saturated with a desire for the product. The show would continue to run as many days as possible, then move on to the next town. A show might remain in a given location between one night and six weeks, depending on how the troupe behaved itself.\n\nMedicine shows often brought entertainment to rural communities that might not have any other sort of performances for years at a time. Whatever the quality of the medical advice, spectators got their money's worth from the free entertainment. Some shows followed circuits covering the entire United States, though most shows focused on the rural midwest and south, where the inhabitants were considered particularly gullible.\n\nThe two largest, most successful American medicine shows were Hamlin’s Wizard Oil Company, founded in Chicago by John and Lysander Hamlin, and the Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company, founded in 1881 by Charles Bigelow and John Healey. Hamlin’s Wizard Oil Company troupes travelled in specially designed wagons, with built-in organs and space for musical performers. Their appeal was clean, moral, musical entertainment for the whole family. Part of their advertising included songsters, or small booklets of song lyrics and Wizard Oil advertising. The Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company created traveling shows based around sham Indian presentational ceremonies, such as war dances and marriages. \"Representatives\" of the Kickapoo tribe translated for the Indians and sold Sagwa, the most famous patent medicine. The company also presented other forms of entertainment, such as vaudeville shows, trained dog acts, dances, and acrobatics.\n\nAs reliable commercial pharmaceuticals were produced on an industrial level in the early 20th century, the reputation of and market for home remedies began to dwindle, and medicine shows came to rely ever more on their entertainment value. But as America's population became less rural and more urbanized, the availability of other forms of entertainment, such as motion pictures, vaudeville and later radio, led to the gradual disappearance of the traveling medicine show. By the 1930s few such companies continued to tour in the United States. Even fewer shows endured the economic and social upheaval of the Great Depression and World War II. Those that survived into the 1950s found themselves competing with television and came to be regarded as relics of an earlier, more innocent era. This novelty, far more than the availability of the remedies peddled, provided the chief support for the last of the traveling medicine shows.\n\nOne of the most famous of the 20th-century traveling shows was the Hadacol Caravan, sponsored by Louisiana State Senator Dudley J. LeBlanc and his LeBlanc Corporation, makers of the dubious patent medicine/vitamin tonic Hadacol, known for both its alleged curative powers and its high alcohol content. The stage show, which ran throughout the Deep South in the 1940s with great publicity, featured a number of notable music acts and Hollywood celebrities and promoted Hadacol, which was sold during intermission and after the show. Admission to the show was paid in boxtops of the vitamin tonic, sold in stores throughout the southern United States. The Caravan came to a sudden halt in 1951, when the Hadacol enterprise fell apart in a financial scandal.\n\nOne of the last great medicine shows had its swan song in the summer of 1972, when the two-man show of Chief Thundercloud (pitchman Leo Kahdot, a Potawatomi from Oklahoma) and Peg Leg Sam (harmonicist-singer-comedian Arthur Jackson) played at a carnival in Pittsboro, North Carolina. It was the last show of the year for them; Kahdot died that winter.\n\nPerhaps the last of the medicine shows was run by Tommy Scott, who staged as many as three hundred shows per year until about 1990. As a teenager in the 1930s, Scott joined the \"\"Doc\" Chambers Medicine Show\", established by M. F. Chambers in the late nineteenth century. Scott sang, played guitar, performed ventriloquism and blackface acts, and pitched Chambers's Herb-O-Lac herbal laxative. When Chambers retired in the late 1930s, Scott took charge of the show, performing for many years with his wife, Mary, and his sidekick, Gaines Blevins, known as \"Old Bleb\". Scott's daughter, Sandra, performed in the show as a singer, bass player, and acrobat, and from the 1960s onward managed the business end of the show. Herb-O-Lac eventually gave way to a mentholated skin liniment, which Scott dubbed Snake Oil. For decades, the show toured arenas and senior centers as \"\"Doc\" Scott's Last Real Old Time Medicine Show\". From the 1960s to the 1980s, the show also solicited donations for charitable organizations such as the Lions Club and the Optimist Club.\n\nThe 1930 film \"The Medicine Man\" mixes comedy and melodrama with a medicine show coming into a small town.\n\nIn the 1932 Fleischer Studios cartoon \"Betty Boop, M.D.\", Betty, Bimbo and Koko are the owners of a traveling medicine show. They are selling \"Jippo\", an all-purpose health tonic, which appears to be water pumped from a fire hydrant, although consuming it has a number of bizarre effects.\n\nIn the 1933 Krazy Kat cartoon \"The Medicine Show\", Krazy runs a medicine show where he performs some acts and sells bottled liquids which have a variety of uses.\n\nJames Thurber's eponymous \"Doc Marlowe\" (published in \"Let Your Mind Alone!\", in 1937) is a retired snake oil salesman in a traveling show, later selling the product as \"Blackhawk Liniment\". In a typical Thurber twist, Marlowe cheats in a small way at cards and in other games of chance, but his massages with snake-oil (a harmless but expensive preparation) are in fact highly effective.\n\nIn the 1949 film \"The Inspector General\", the character played by Danny Kaye works for a medicine show, selling \"Yakov's Golden Elixir\".\n\nSeveral modern musical acts have named themselves after this old-time phenomenon, including Old Crow Medicine Show, Dr. West's Medicine Show and Junk Band, Moondog Medicine Show, Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show and MV & EE Medicine Show. The name was also used in the titles of The Dream Syndicate's album \"Medicine Show\", Big Audio Dynamite's song \"Medicine Show\", Moxy Früvous's song \"The Incredible Medicine Show\", and The Band's song \"W.S. Walcott Medicine Show\". Throughout 2010 and 2011, the hip hop artist Madlib released a 12-part mix series with the title \"Madlib Medicine Show\".\n\nScience fiction author Orson Scott Card titled his online sci-fi journal \"The Intergalactic Medicine Show\".\n\nBritish comedy trio The Goodies perform a scene as part of \"The Goodies Traveling Medicine Show\" in the episode of their TV series entitled \"Hospital For Hire\". The scene includes a planted shill (Tim Brooke-Taylor) being pulled from the audience to 'prove' that the mystery elixir cured all ailments.\n\nIn Rockstar's video game \"Red Dead Redemption\", one of the main characters plays the role of an early 20th-century hustler peddling what John Marston refers to as snake oil.\n\n\"Your Song\", by Elton John, also mentions a man who makes \"potions in a traveling show\".\n\nIn 1970 two original members of The Open Theater, Barbara Vann and James Barbosa, founded Medicine Show Theatre Ensemble also in New York. It moved around a number of times in its early years, having permanent performing spaces in 14 different locations until finally settling on West 52nd Street, where it remains today. Its work has consisted of new plays, original adaptations of classic books, reconstructions of classic musicals (especially those by Cole Porter) which were thought to have been lost, and clever adaptations of famous works, like inserting Cole Porter songs into Shakespeare plays and turning them into musical comedies.\n\nOn the 1974 album \"Everything You Know Is Wrong\" by the comedy troupe The Firesign Theatre, the recording's narrator plays a wire recording of \"Dr. Firesign's\" medicine show, in which \"Professor Archer\" promotes \"Chief Dancing Knockout's Pyramid Pushover Paste\" and \"Don Brouhaha's Inca Hell-Oil Tonic\". Archer and his assistant prepare and ingest an hallucinogenic potion with these ingredients which leads to an encounter with an Indian shaman. The entertainment consists of a play parodying \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\".\n\nThe song \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\", performed by Cher, is about a girl who was \"born in the wagon of a traveling show\". Her father would sell bottles of snake oil medicine called \"Doctor Good\".\n\nThe music video for the Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney song \"Say, Say, Say\" shows McCartney, his wife, and Jackson performing a traditional medicine show.\n\nIn the \"Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy\" episode of \"The Simpsons\", Homer and Grampa Simpson travel across country, giving medicine shows for their aphrodisiac, \"Simpson and Son's Tonic\".\n\nPerforming as medicine pitchman J. Phineas Flusterbeck, magician Mark Nilsen presents shows based on the old medicine shows. He pitches \"Blue Root Elixir\", which (according to a fabricated biography) \"restored his confidence in the gullibility of the American public\".\n\nMagician \"Pop\" Haydn models his magic shows after old-time medicine shows, complete with the selling of several products such as \"Pop Haydn's Miracle Oil\", which he claims to have received from \"Placebo Indians\".\n\nThe 1977 live-action/animated musical film \"Pete's Dragon\" features a medicine showman called Dr. Terminus (played by Jim Dale), and local townspeople being first skeptical, then duped, by his claimed healing abilities.\n\n\n"}

Hunt, the office was commissioned to help facilitate and provide a base of operation for North Carolina's burgeoning film industry. Governor Hunt appointed William \"Bill\" Arnold to lead the office. In 1984, producer Dino De Laurentiis created De Laurentiis Entertainment Group. He built and based a studio complex (now EUE/Screen Gems ) in Wilmington, North Carolina. The area quickly became one of the busiest production centers for film and television east of Hollywood. The North Carolina Film Office was created during a time when new technology, audience demand for location authenticity, and Hollywood’s need for lower production costs were driving filmmakers to search distant sites throughout the United States for fresh places to make movies.\n\nWith Bill Arnold leading, the North Carolina Film Commission witnessed a dramatic increase in production during the 1980s and the 1990s. Notable films during this time include: \"The Color Purple\" (1985), \"Dirty Dancing\" (1987), \"Bull Durham\" (1988), \"Days of Thunder\" (1990), \"Sleeping with the Enemy\" (1991), \"Last of the Mohicans\" (1992), \"The Fugitive\" (1993), and \"The Crow\" (1994). In 1998 Wilmington, NC became the home of the WB's critically acclaimed television network series \"Dawson's Creek\". The series remained in Wilmington until 2003 when it was cancelled and replaced with \"One Tree Hill\"—a series on The WB/CW that calls North Carolina \"home.\" \"One Tree Hill\" ended in 2012 after nine seasons.\n\nWhile Wilmington, NC continued to sustain itself with television, the international film climate began to shift out of North Carolina's favor. In an effort to keep production costs even cheaper, early 2000 saw production companies making films internationally. The North Carolina Film Commission was made most aware of this trend when it lost Charles Frazier's North Carolina tale, \"Cold Mountain\", to the country of Romania. Hoping to bring an international industry back to the United States, many law-makers across the US began creating incentives packages to encourage filming in individual states. North Carolina's legislature decided on pursuing a competitive incentive program. On August 8, 2006, Governor Mike F. Easley signed into law a legislation offering productions a full 15% tax credit on a minimum $250,000 spend in North Carolina (and not to exceed a $7.5M credit.) Since this program's inception, the NC Film Office has seen a substantial increase in production, as have other state's that have established similar programs. Since 2006, the North Carolina Film Office has recruited the following films: George Clooney's \"Leatherheads\" (2008), \"Nights in Rodanthe\" (2008) starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane, \"The Marc Pease Experience\" (2008) with Ben Stiller, and \"Bolden!\" (2008), a film about the life of jazz legend Buddy Bolden.\n\nIn September 2006, Commissioner Bill Arnold retired after 26 years of service to North Carolina's film industry. The North Carolina Film Office is now part of the NC Department of Commerce's Division of Tourism, Film and Sports Development. Aaron Syrett (former Director of the Utah Film Commission) was hired as Director of the North Carolina Film Office in spring 2007; his tenure ended at the end of July 2014. While building upon North Carolina's legacy, Syrett is taking a 21st-century approach to boost the global visibility of North Carolina's resources.\n\nThe North Carolina Film Office has 3 main responsibilities: market the State of North Carolina, serve the film industry, and serve the State of North Carolina. The office actively works to create a healthy climate in which to grow film industry economic development. A marketing agency as well, the film office educates the film industry on North Carolina's incentives program, promotes the state's infrastructure, and showcases North Carolina's diverse locations.\n\nProjects (including film, television and commercial) are actively recruited and nurturted by the office. The office encourages industry-related companies to headquarter or have satellite companies in the state. The office ultimately serves the State of North Carolina by keeping and creating jobs in North Carolina for film crew and related businesses. As such, the film office must serve the film industry in an efficient and engaging capacity. The office hosts location scouts for producers and also provides on-the-ground assistance before and during filming. The North Carolina Film Office is the official liaison between the industry and state agencies for state property use, highway assistance, and other issues.\n\nThe office has always maintained sophisticated communications with the film industry. Not only has it maintained an informative website, but also it has supported the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival and for 9 years sponsored the American Film Market. Every spring the office participates in the Locations Trade Show hosted by the Association of Film Commissioners International in Santa Monica, CA. Members of the office make regular trips to Los Angeles, CA to meet with producers and also visit Park City, UT every January to network at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe North Carolina Film Office works in tandem with 6 affiliate offices that are both publicly and privately maintained. All are certified by the Association of Film Commissioners International.\n\nThe North Carolina Film Office has a 4-person staff. Until July 2014, the director of the North Carolina Film Office was Aaron Syrett (2007-2014). In addition to working with affiliate commissions, the North Carolina Film Office is also supported by a governor-appointed group who offer advice and guidance in the interest of North Carolina's film industry. Notable members include casting director, Craig Fincannon, founder of the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, Nancy Buirski, and former President of Universal Pictures, Thom Mount. Studio Executive Frank Capra, Jr. was also a member of the council until his death in 2007.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8753812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8753812", "title": "Prostitution in Finland", "text": "Prostitution in Finland\n\nProstitution in Finland (the exchange of sexual services for money) is legal but soliciting in a public place, organized prostitution (operating a brothel or a prostitution ring and other forms of pimping) is illegal. According to a 2010 TAMPEP study, 69% of prostitutes working in Finland are migrants.\nAs of 2009, there was little 'visible' prostitution in Finland as it was mostly limited to private residences and nightclubs in larger metropolitan areas.\n\nThe socio-legal history of prostitution in Finland is similar to that of other European and Western countries, with various periods of tolerance, regulation and abolition.\n\nThe passing of the Civil Code of 1734 was the first nation-wide law for all of Sweden, as well as Finland, that prohibited prostitution. The historical position of sexual morality was based on the Christian standard of condemning both premarital and extramarital sexual relations. These religious values were reflected in the common law across Europe and most Western societies throughout this period.\n\nThe next major development came in the form of the 1889 Penal Code of Finland, which prohibited both pandering and prostitution. The code extended the prohibition to cover ‘any professional fornication’, meaning the law would not tolerate prostitution no matter where it was taking place. International activism concerning prostitution at the end of the 19th century transformed the societal view of prostitution as an aspect of urban life to one which perceived the labour as a social problem. This evolution demanded the removal of prostitutes from the public eye through criminalisation of the female prostitutes as delinquents.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1986 the Vagrancy Act was also in effect in Finland. In accordance with the legislation prostitutes could be taken under control and given orders by the police and social and health care authorities. This could include interrogations, sending to institutions, arrests, obligations to undergo health examinations and various other regulatory requests.\n\nActivism after World War II and the gradual 20th century abandoning of the standard of absolute sexual morality again shifted social perceptions of prostitution. The economic depression, alongside other structural and political reasons, contributed to an increase in the sex trade after the Second World War. The universal human rights movement of the time pushed for the decriminalisation of prostitution so as not to punish women who were victims of poverty or exploitation.\n\nThe geopolitical position of Finland, and its position in the European Union as of 1995, had a significant influence on the sex trade in the 1990s. Access to sex services became increasingly easier across most cities and rural areas in Finland during this time. The established political connection with Western Europe allowed people to move more freely across borders and hence engage in the sex services market in Finland. Authorities estimated that in the 1990s the amount of prostitutes working in Finland was approximately 2000, with 200 of these being of foreign origin. The effects of economic depression, mass unemployment and the resulting economic position of women also contributed to the intensification in the volume and forms of national prostitution. The increased trend of transnational organised crime in pandering and human trafficking operations shifted public concern from the protection of public morality to protection of public order and security.\n\nThe UN Trafficking Protocol, adopted in Finland in 2000, and the European Union Council Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings, adopted in 2002, both obligated cooperating states to criminalise trafficking and increase border control to prevent transnational organised crime. These international obligations acted as the starting point for the restructuring of prostitution legislation in Finland. In 2003 both the purchasing and selling of sexual services were prohibited under Finnish law where either occurred in a public place.\n\nStreet prostitution consisted of both foreign and native prostitutes; however, a majority of the bunch are foreign prostitutes. This was made up of the female prostitutes and males referred to as \"kerb-crawlers\" that sought out the services of the female prostitutes. Street prostitution made its way to the center of the capital city of Helsinki where it became very popular with about 50 street prostitutes. Local residents of Helsinki were upset with the allowance of street prostitution in their neighborhoods, so in 1994 a female activist group formed in order to abolish street prostitution as a whole. They started the movement called \"Prostitution Off the Streets\" where they patrolled the streets at night for any potential street prostitution as well as initiated a petition against street prostitution. This type of prostitution was legal until 1999 when laws prohibited prostitution in public spaces. This new law pushed the business of street prostitution north to the city of Vantaa until a year later when Vantaa also began prohibiting prostitution in public spaces.\n\nThe Internet has become a popular place for advertising business; prostitution is no exception. Pictures of prostitutes and their services began being advertised online with about 80%-90% of the industry utilizing the internet in some capacity to advertise. In the early 2000’s, Finland removed servers that advertised prostitution due to ‘procuring’ that the Criminal Code has outlined since 2004. However, these operations are still being run remotely in countries such as Spain. This makes it difficult for police to take action against ‘procuring’ online because, as behind the scenes operations are being taken care of remotely, they cannot trace any of the activity; they can only uncover the prostitute.\n\nRestaurants became a location for a lot of foreign prostitutes in Finland to sell their services, particularly in the city center of Helsinki. Restaurants were willing to partake in this form of prostitution because they were able to make a profit off of the prostitutes by charging them a fee when entering the restaurant for business as well as when they leave with a client. In addition to the fees, the women in erotic restaurants also lured more traffic into the restaurants which allowed the restaurants to profit even further. In the grand scheme of things, Finland as a whole also technically benefits from erotic restaurants as they are legal establishments that pay taxes so when these women create more clients for the restaurants, more money goes to taxes.\n\nIn Finland, newspaper publications promoted prostitution. This was a pretty common form of advertising before the introduction of online prostitution in the early 2000s. However, the newspapers were not blatant in their advertising. They used phrases such as 'company for daytime coffee' to suggest prostitution. Occasionally, the ads would reference a “massage”, which was also a phrase that soon became synonymous with prostitution. In addition to these phrases, the newspaper ad included a phone number for the potential clients to call to obtain the desired services. Most of the newspaper ad clients, specifically, were men from Finland rather than foreign clients. Newspaper ads for prostitution are no longer common due to the changing technological times.\n\nBuying or attempting to buy sex from a minor is illegal. The Public Law and Order Act prohibits offering or buying sex in a public place. Although prostitution has become legal, procuring still remains illegal. Procuring includes anything that would be considered the organization or facilitation of services for prostitutes. The criminalisation of the purchase of sex from adults has been a continuing topic of discussion in the Nordic countries. In June 2006, parliament voted by 158 to 15 with four abstentions to approve a bill which outlaws the buying of sexual services from sex workers if it is linked to human trafficking. The issue was raised again in 2013 by the Justice Minister. The current legal position in Finland therefore allows for the private sale of sexual services, for example in brothels, but any form of human trafficking is both against the law and in breach of international human rights obligations.\n\nVenla Roth comments that the current Finnish penal position can be seen as a compromise between the two conflicting positions on the legality of prostitution.\n\nA significant number of the prostitutes working in Finland are foreign. The proportion of the prostitutes that are migrants has increased over time, largely due to increased accessibility, political positions and economic factors. This increased accessibility may be attributed to the geographic location of Finland because of its proximity to other European countries as well as the fact that Finland is considered to be a transit country.\n\nIn 1999 a special section was enacted under the Aliens Act in Finland. It specifies that where there are reasonable grounds to suspect an alien may sell sexual services he or she may be refused entrance into the country. The provision was justified as an objective to protect Finnish citizens from the social disturbances caused by prostitutes coming in from the East.\n\nFollowing the enactment of the special provision, between 1999 and 2007, Border Guard authorities refused the entry of more than 1730 persons on the grounds of suspicion that they sold sexual services or had earned their income though dishonest means. By 2006 this number had escalated to 3300 refusals. These figures continue to increase, with Finnish police reporting that during the years of 2011 and 2012 there were more persons than ever deported because of suspicions of the sale of sexual services.\n\nDespite legislative prevention measures, there continues to be a significant number of foreign prostitutes working in Finland. The National Bureau of Investigation estimated in 2002 that the annual number of foreign prostitutes was between 10,000 and 15,000, with most of them originating from Russia and Estonia but also from other European countries. The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) noted that the majority of prostitutes working in Finland are estimated to be either foreigners living permanently in Finland or travelling from country to country under tourist visas. The Finnish Bureau of Investigation suspects that almost all of these foreign prostitutes work under the control of organised procurers.\n\nThe Aliens Act and the enforcement of the refusal to enter by authorities has been subject to polarised opinions and various human rights concerns.\n\nIn 2003 the National Bureau of Investigation stated trafficking of human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation did not occur in Finland, and said that all foreign prostitutes were “fully aware of the nature and conditions of the work”. This statement, and the 1999 amendment of the Aliens Act, have however been severely critiqued on the basis that they ignore the disadvantaged status of foreign prostitutes. Marte Mesna argues that deporting foreigners where they are suspected of coming into the country to sell sex portrays that when there are people other than citizens involved, “it is the prostitutes who suddenly become the problem again”. Venla Roth also argues along these lines, claiming that placing foreign prostitutes outside of the public system means they are not protected and are more vulnerable to exploitation. Knowledge that a person has sold sexual services in the past constitutes reasonable grounds to believe he or she intends to do it again, hence qualifying as a ground for denial of entrance into Finland.\n\nPro-tukipiste r.y. (Pro Centre Finland), a registered non-profit organisation, supports and promotes the civil and human rights of sex workers in Finland, offering professional social support, health care services and legal advice, operating in Helsinki and Tampere. Services are provided without charge, anonymously, and the centre is politically and religiously independent. It also offers consultation on issues concerning sex work and human trafficking. They are a partner in the Indoors Project, a European Union initiative for analysis and policy recommendations on sex work inside the EU.\n\nPro-tukipiste estimates that the number of individual persons in contact with the organisation and their services each year is between 1500 and 2000. The majority of these people are women with migrant backgrounds.\n\nOn a smaller scale, a union group by the name of SALLI, United Sex Professionals formed in 2002, also aimed to protect the human rights of sex workers in Finland. The group of 9 sex workers that founded this organization focused on \"sex workers' human rights in terms of their well being, safety at work, professional skills, and control of workplace working conditions\".\n\nLegislation concerning the purchase of sexual services remains subject to ongoing debate in Finland and the wider Nordic region. The two fundamental polarised views are those promoting legalisation of the profession and those promoting total abolition.\n\nLegaliser is the term given to those who advocate for the rights of prostitutes, including the right to work. It is argued that the United Nations resolutions guaranteeing the right to work, such as the 1988 International Labour Organization recognition of sex work, align with promoting the rights of sex workers.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, in its annual Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Finland, discuss discrimination in respect to employment and occupation in their 2016 report on Finland. While the Bureau does not explicitly state the law on prostitution to be in breach of the right to work, those who adopt the legaliser approach stress this relationship.\n\nAbolitionists are the people whom advocate for the opposing view in relation to prostitution. This argument is largely based on United Nations statements against prostitution from the early days of the League of Nations and the Palermo Protocol (2002) on preventing trafficking in persons, especially women and children. This position reflects the increased public concern about human trafficking and its connection to prostitution.\n\nThe Ministry of Social Affairs and Health in Finland started a five-year national programme for the Prevention of Prostitution and Violence against Women from 1998 to 2002, demonstrating its preference of total prohibition. The Minister of Social Affairs and Health, who chaired this programme, claims the negative health implications of prostitution raise concerns related to human rights and ethics. Finland’s Minister of Justice, Anna-Maja Henriksson, argued for total prohibition of all forms of sex purchase in 2012.\n\nThe Nordic Model refers to the legal position of Sweden where it is illegal to buy sexual services but the sale of one’s own body for the sexual services is not illegal. This position attempts to reduce the demand for prostitution by punishing the clients instead of the prostitutes. The European Parliament advanced in a non-binding resolution passed on 26 February 2014 that all EU countries should adopt this approach. It was emphasised that prostitution as a profession violates human dignity and human rights whether the work is forced or voluntary. The European Parliament therefore focuses on finding exit strategies and alternative sources of income for women working as prostitutes. This resolution, calling on the example of the Nordic model, was adopted by 343 votes to 139, with 105 abstentions.\n\nIn September 2009 the Ministry of Justice submitted a report to Parliament. The report discussed the link between the demand for sexual services and human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. CEDAW however stress that the prevalence of trafficking is also influenced by multiple other factors, including those relating to economic and political instability. They therefore advance that it is important to view prostitution and the demand for sexual services and trafficking from a broad, holistic point of view.\n\nPro-tukipiste also provides their perspective in relation to the information in the Ministry of Justice report. They claim the data is bias, narrow and questionable with no voice given to those who sell the sexual services. It is also suggested by the organisation in their own studies that the current law in Finland has caused the position of prostitutes to deteriorate, the risk of violence to increase and has introduced further negative impacts for foreign workers.\n\nThe United States attributed Finland a Tier 2 rating through their State Department Trafficking in Person (TIP) Report League in 2003. Alongside Uganda and Albania, Finland was given this rating on the basis of rumours of ‘enclosed prostitution camps’. The Finnish Minister of Justice and several EU allies rebutted the US claims.\n\nOver time, prostitution has become more accepted by people, prodominately men, in Finland. The 2012 Gender Equality Barometer study showed that from 2004 to 2008, only 60% of men found it socially acceptable to pay prostitutes for sex. However, that number increased to 66% of males in 2012. This study also showed that men find it more socially acceptable to pay for sex than women do, as they are the main clientele for prostitution services. However, the amount of men that actually reported purchasing sex in the Finsex survey conducted in 2007, was significantly lower around about 3% of men. Men buying services from prostitutes view it as a normal behavior that speaks to their sexuality. Weather these men are using prostitution as a way to avoid relationships or responsibilities, they enjoy the feeling of power they achieve through these acts.\n\nIn contrast, prostitution was often controversial for those opposed to it as it was synonymous with drugs, crime, and immoral behavior. Street prostitution, specifically, was seen by residents as a downturn in their neighborhoods. Residents of neighborhoods in which street prostitution became increasingly popular viewed it as an issue of morality. They believed it was their moral duty to \"clean\" the streets of these prostitutes, because of the negative connotations it brought to their neighborhoods, which they believed would create a better environment for everyone.\n\nThe health of sex workers in Finland has been an ongoing project of the Finnish Government and data suggests a good level of health, and in particular an absence of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nThe National Council of Women in Finland notes that obtaining evidence and research on the purchase of sexual services overall has proven difficult in practice, particularly from procured prostitutes. The Association suggests that authorities must either allocate sufficient resources to the enforcement of the current penal provision or reconsider the most appropriate legal position.\n\nFinland is a transit, destination, and limited source country for women and girls subjected to sex trafficking. Traffickers operate from abroad using threats of violence, debt leverage, and other forms of coercion. Victims originate primarily in Eastern Europe, West Africa, and Asia. Authorities report a surge in potential trafficking victims among rejected asylum-seekers returning to Finland under the Dublin Agreement, including a rise in the number of individuals exploited prior to their arrival in Finland, such as Nigerian women who account for the majority of sex trafficking victims.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Finland as a 'Tier 1' country.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16368719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16368719", "title": "Seriality (gender studies)", "text": "Seriality (gender studies)\n\nSeriality or serial collectivity is a term that feminist scholar Iris Marion Young used to describe a reconceptualization of the category of woman in her 1994 essay \"Gender as Seriality\". Young borrows the concept of seriality from Sartre's \"Critique of Dialectical Reason\", where he originally developed the idea to describe the relationship of individuals to social classes and the capitalist system of production and consumption. Understanding women as a \"series\", rather than a \"group\", entails the recognition that the category \"woman\" is not defined by any common biological or psychological characteristics; rather, individuals are positioned as \"woman\" by a set of material and immaterial social constructs that are the product of previous human actions.\n\nA group, in Sartre's definition, is a collection of people who self-consciously recognize themselves to be in a unified relationship with each other in the undertaking of a common project. A mutual acknowledgment of actively shared goals is the chief feature of a group. Guilds, reading groups, addiction support groups and animal cruelty prevention groups are all examples of groups.\n\nSeriality, in contrast to the active effort of group being, describes a level of social existence that is habitually constrained and directed by existing circumstances and material conditions.\nIn a series, a collection of people are unified \"passively\" by objects, routines practices and habits around which their actions are oriented. For instance, people waiting in line for a bus, radio listeners, prison inmates and street theatre spectators are all examples of series. In each example, individuals are oriented toward the same goals by their response to existing conditions and structures in the environment, which are the collective legacy of human actions and decisions in the past. To illustrate concretely, the actions of people who stop and watch a street theatre performance may be shaped by existing conditions which constrain and permit their actions, such as the social acceptability of staging a performance on the street, the attractive costumes of the performers, high unemployment rates among actors, the existence of a public square, social expectations of their roles as spectators. Members of a series are anonymous and isolated, although not alone, often individuals in a series take into account the expected behavior of other members when pursuing their own actions – for instance, a bus rider may choose to avoid rush hour traffic. Members of a series are also interchangeable, although not identical, in relation to the objects that effect their serialized condition: from the point of view of a radio program broadcaster, one listener is interchangeable with another.\n\nGroups and series are related in that groups arise out of a backdrop of seriality, and disperse to fall back into serialized conditions. In other words, groups are the product of individuals' response to shared conditions; Young gives the example of commuters at a bus stop who, when the bus fails to appear, organize themselves into a group to hail taxis, complain to the bus company, etc.\n\nYoung's reconceptualization of \"women\" as a \"series\" is an attempt to provide a solution to the problems in feminist discourse surrounding the grouping of all women in a single category. This problem exists as a dilemma between two conflicting positions: \n\ni) On one hand, it is important to be able to speak of women as a group for practical political reasons. Feminist politics is organized around this category of \"woman\"; its existence as a movement fundamentally depends on this conceptualization. Additionally, the category of \"women\" is necessary in order to understand oppression and disadvantage as something that is systematically inflicted upon women (or any societal group) in a structured, institutionalized process, as opposed to being a natural or unique condition. \n\nii) On the other hand, the category of \"woman\" is fraught with problems of essentialization, normalization and exclusion. As Elizabeth Spelman points out, social categories are constructs that carry latent expressions of privilege and subordination; in this manner, feminist theories have often assumed the experience of white, middle-class heterosexual women as representative for all women, excluding less privileged points of view. Chandra Mohanty suggests that the category of \"woman\" creates the false impression of a coherent, homogeneous group, which leads to the mistake of assuming that all women are equally powerless and oppressed, rather than generating specific questions about oppression that can be empirically investigated. Judith Butler goes as far as to argue that the very act of defining such a gender category is what produces the normalizations that privilege some viewpoints and exclude others.\n\nThinking of \"woman\" as a series solves these conceptual problems. It allows one to meaningfully use the category while avoiding the mistake of falsely essentializing women as a group. An essentialist approach attempts to define \"woman\" by common biological characteristics – evidently false when one considers, for instance, transgender, bigender or intersex people, for instance – or by finding commonality in the vast diversity of women's actual lives, clearly not a viable enterprise.\nA serial conception of \"woman\" also disconnects the idea of gender from an individual's personal identity, as it defines gender as a pre-existing set of societal forces that are visited upon each individual; this approach does not make any claims about the way individuals respond to these pressures. Indeed, the conception of gender as seriality derives its strength from precisely the fact that it does not attempt a comprehensive definition of the individual, but acknowledges that individuals exist within structures that constrain and channel their actions in particular ways.\n\nYoung has suggested that the concept of seriality might also be usefully applied to relationships of race or nationality as linkages which also result from historical conditions – such as the institution of slavery and projects of nation-building – which also function to limit and enable individuals' actions on the level of everyday life and habit.\n\n\nYoung, Iris M. \"Gender as Seriality: Thinking about Women as a Social Collective\", \"Signs\", 19:3 (1994), p. 713-738 (subscription is required to access article)\n"}

{"id": "10229264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10229264", "title": "Under the Mat", "text": "Under the Mat\n\nUnder the Mat: Inside Wrestling's Greatest Family is a book co-written by Diana Hart (daughter of Stu and Helen Hart, ex-wife of Davey Boy Smith and mother of Harry Smith) and journalist Kirstie McLellan. The subtitle, \"Inside Wrestling's Greatest Family\", refers to the Canadian Hart wrestling family, which includes wrestlers such as Smith Hart, Bruce Hart, Keith Hart, Dean Hart, Bret Hart, Ross Hart, Owen Hart, Teddy Hart, David Hart Smith and Natalya Neidhart among others. The book is highly controversial and was pulled from stores after Martha Hart, widow of Owen Hart and Diana Hart's sister-in-law, filed a lawsuit. The book became an Alberta top ten nonfiction best-seller on its release.\n\nThe writing of the book was at least partially motivated by the death of her younger brother Owen Hart. Hart has also stated that she hoped that the book would lead to her brother Bret respecting her and taking her seriously, which she did not feel he had done during the investigation and trial which surrounded the death of Owen Hart.\n\nMcLellan has stated that she and Hart know each other personally and Hart approached her to make the book together.\n\nThe book focuses mainly on the realities of professional wrestling. \"Under the Mat\" recounts Diana's life growing up in the Hart home, being sister to Owen and Bret, witnessing their rise to fame and the terrible tragedy which claimed Owen's life. She remembers her father training some of the WWF's and WCW's biggest names in her family's basement gym, the famous Dungeon, and recounts their tales to stardom.\n\nIn the chapter \"Roots\" she also discusses her family's history on her mother's side. It focuses mostly on her grandfather, American marathon runner Harry Smith.\n\nThe book has received generally negative critique. It has been criticised for its factual errors, grammatical mistakes, spelling issues and unstructured content. It has also been criticised for its overwhelming focus on negative events. According to employees of the Toronto-based law firm Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP, a preliminary review of the book identified dozens of significant factual errors.\n\nHart has been accused of using \"Under the Mat\" as a way to express the \"dirty secrets\" of the Hart family and friends. Hart elaborates on negative details related to several people including Dynamite Kid, Bret Hart, Martha Hart, Andrea Hart and Davey Boy Smith. People like Dynamite Kid, Ben Bassarab, Davey Boy Smith and Bret are in the book accused of several occasions of criminal activity. Hart has especially been accused of trying to discredit her brother Bret Hart and attempting to portray him as an obsessive egomaniac.\n\n\"Toronto Star\" book reviewer Michael Holmes stated that the book was \"terribly underwritten, ridiculously simplistic and pointlessly episodic, repetitive and error-riddled.\" He also said that the book was \"one of the most manipulative, megamaniacal, deliberately unselfconscious books I have ever read. Reading it makes you feel dirty.\"\n\nInitially, when asked about whether she had noticed any backlash from family or others, such as Jim Neidhart, Diana stated that she didn't care what Neidhart thought about the book. She also stated that the book was not intended to be vindictive and that she is very proud to be a Hart.\n\nHer brother Bret is a vocal critic of the book and has said that it is a very disturbing read and called it pornographic. He goes on to say that there are enough true Hart stories that Diana didn't need to resort to fiction. Bret and others have also questioned the legitimacy of the foreword which Diana claims to be written by their father, Stu. McLellan has stated that Bret was very upset by the book and that he confronted her about it in public at a gym which they both went to at the time.\n\nOne of her other brothers, Bruce, has also criticised the book, and called it \"ill conceived\" and expressed that he can't understand why his sister would write such a book. He has hypothesized that Hart may have been mentally unstable at the time of the writing.\n\nLegal action was pursued by Martha Hart, Owen Hart's widow. Martha claims that Diana made inaccurate and irresponsible statements about her and her family. She stated that the book was “filled with distortions, misstatements and unjustified slurs that attempt to destroy the reputation of my family and me, and undermine the memory of Owen.” Diana defended herself in an interview for the National Post and stated that she stood by what she has written, insinuating that Martha was a rich bully who was trying to use her money to suppress her recounts. She stated \"Martha has money to fight me on it and I don't. I know what I have written is true.\" The book was pulled from bookstores across Canada by publisher H.B. Fenn and Co. Ltd. in January 2002. Removing the book was part of a settlement between Martha Hart and the publisher. As part of the settlement, the publisher expressed its regrets and a financial settlement was paid to the Owen Hart Foundation, a Calgary-based charity created by Martha.\n\nLong-time wrestling announcer and Stampede alumni Ed Whalen also discredited the book, referring to it as a \"fairy tale\" and considered joining Martha Hart in the lawsuit.\n\nHart has later asserted that the stories that were printed in the book, were completely twisted and changed from how she had written them originally, and was deeply hurt by the controversy that was caused for her family from the book. Her brother Bret has questioned her claim that she wasn't aware of the book's content before publication.\n\nHeath McCoy, the author of the book \"\" has stated that there is some truth to some of the statements in the book, such as Hart's claim of her mother Helen's alcoholism.\n\nTom Billington, The Dynamite Kid has admitted to some of the criminal actions which he was accused of in the book.\n\nMartha Hart's book, \"Broken Harts: The Life and Death of Owen Hart\", was partially written in response to \"Under The Mat\".\n\nDiana Hart has later on disowned the book and called it a failure as a journey and has stated that she is now on good terms with her brothers and sisters. She has later written a trilogy of fiction books. Even though Hart has disowned the book she has decided that it will still be mentioned in her author bio at the back of her new books.\n\nMcLellan has stated that Hart took her on \"an amazing journey\" when writing the book. After the release of Under the Mat McLellan has helped write several other nonfiction books and autobiographies, including the best selling autobiography of former National Hockey League (NHL) player Theoren Fleury named \"Playing with Fire\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33380712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33380712", "title": "Vegetation deity", "text": "Vegetation deity\n\nA vegetation deity is a nature deity whose disappearance and reappearance, or life, death and rebirth, embodies the growth cycle of plants. In nature worship, the deity can be a god or goddess with the ability to regenerate itself. A vegetation deity is often a fertility deity. The deity typically undergoes dismemberment (see \"sparagmos\"), scattering, and reintegration, as narrated in a myth or reenacted by a religious ritual. The cyclical pattern is given theological significance on themes such as immortality, resurrection, and reincarnation. Vegetation myths have structural resemblances to certain creation myths in which parts of a primordial being's body generate aspects of the cosmos, such as the Norse myth of Ymir.\n\nIn mythography of the 19th and early 20th century, as for example in \"The Golden Bough\" of J.G. Frazer, the figure is related to the \"corn spirit\", \"corn\" in this sense meaning grain in general. That triviality is giving the concept its tendency to turn into a meaningless generality, as Walter Friedrich Otto remarked of trying to use a \"name as futile and yet pretentious as 'Vegetation deity'\".\n\nIn the Mesopotamian tradition, during the journey of Inanna or Ishtar to the underworld, the earth becomes sterile, and neither humans nor animals are able to procreate. After confronting Ereshkigal, her sister and ruler of the underworld, Inanna is killed, but an emissary from the gods administers potions to restore her to life. She is allowed to return to the upper world only if someone else will take her place. Her husband, the vegetation god Dumuzi, agrees to spend half the year in the underworld, during which time vegetation dies off. His return brings regrowth.\n\nIn ancient Egyptian religion, the cultural achievements of Osiris among the peoples of the earth provokes the envy of his brother Set, who kills and dismembers him. Osiris's wife Isis makes a journey to gather his fourteen scattered body parts. In some versions, she buries each part where she finds it, causing the desert to put forth vegetation. In other versions, she reassembles his body and resurrects him, and he then becomes the ruler of the afterlife.\n\nIn European folklore, a woman's fertility has an influence on farming. Vegetation goddess figurines from the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture have a lozenge and dot pattern that represents a sown field and female fertility. The death of vegetation is also associated with the travel to the underworld of Ningishzida.\n\nIn the parables of Jesus, such as the Parable of the Sower, \"the sower soweth the word\" where the seed is the word of God. The parables of the mustard seed and the growing seed explain the Kingdom of God where growth is due to God, not man, and follows its own timetable.\n\nIn the Gospel of John 12:24, the death and resurrection of Jesus is compared to a kernel that falls in the ground and dies, and then produces many seeds. In many Christian traditions, Easter sunrise service or \"Resurrection Service\" is held in God's Acre where the bodies of the dead are \"sown as seed.\" The sowing of seeds also refers to scattering of people away from their ancestral homeland.\n\nOther examples of vegetation deities include:\n"}

Their mission was to increase the participation of women in the democratic processes of voting and drafting the constitution. In collaboration with United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNTAC),and with CWCNVE launched advocacy and media campaigns and produced radio programmes about voting. They collaborated with the NGO MediaTies to train a group of women in video production skills in order to document the election from a non-partisan perspective.\n\nThe momentum continued during the drafting of the Constitution of Cambodia. Through workshops, they gathered ideas from rural women, and presented them to the Constituent Assembly. One outcome of those workshops was the production of a seven-minute video. It was called 'The Rights of Women To Be Guaranteed' and was broadcast nationally as the Constitution was being drafted.</p align>\n\nSome of the coalition members recognized the need to continue to promote the rights of women even after the elections and UNTAC. They recognized the power of the media in promoting and protecting these rights as well as raising pressing development issues in the country. This core group of women went on to become the founders of the Women's Media Centre of Cambodia, and officially established it as a non-profit, non-governmental organization in January 1995.\n\nSince 1995 ‘Women's Media Centre of Cambodia’ (WMC) continues acknowledging the power of media in promoting social change in Cambodian society. WMC is committed towards promoting gender equity, women's empowerment, and raising gender awareness in Cambodian society by discussing and bringing different issues that are often being not discussed openly and considered less important by various stakeholders. We have given voice and tried to unfold hidden and untold stories by discussing issues of developmental debates of decentralization and poverty together covering the issues like HIV and AIDS, trafficking, elections and domestic violence. WMC encourages promoting inclusive and optimistic media environment equally to all of its members and to the Cambodian community.\n\nWomen's Radio FM 102 (Khmer: វិទ្យុស្ត្រីអេហ្វអឹម ១០២) produces educational radio programs designed for all sectors of Cambodian society, especially women in rural areas.\n\nWe potentially reach out to 75 percent of the population through a 10 kW antenna located in Phnom Penh, four relay stations in Kampong Thom province, Svay Rieng province, Battambang province, and Kratie province and via extensive partner radio networks throughout the country.\n\nRadio Free Asia rated Women's Radio FM 102 as the most popular radio station in Cambodia in 2010. The Cambodian Sentinel Survey carried out by BBC World Service Trust from 2007 to 2009 consistently rated Women's Radio, FM 102 as one of the top two leading radio stations in Cambodia. Unlike the other leading stations, Women's Radio FM 102 is more popular with female audiences than men.\n\nWomen's Radio FM 102 does not advertise spots promoting tobacco, alcohol, cosmetic and a few other items which may cause health concern to consumers.\n\nWMC does not have its own TV Channel, but it has a TV unit which cooperates with local and international NGOs to produce television programs on social issues in Cambodia. This unit also produces weekly TV dramas, comedies and documentaries, which explore pressing social issues in the country. WMC does not own a TV station; thus, its programs are broadcast on SEA (South East Asia) TV, TVK (National Television—Television Kampuchea) and CTN (Cambodian Television Network) and through contact provinces, which enables the programs to be available to the general public.\n\nThe TV unit researches and examines “hot topics” in Cambodia and produces and broadcasts high-quality weekly TV programs as well as Edutainment Videos in response to these topics. Through popular television genres of drama, comedy, documentaries, and vox-pop, WMC positively impacts national audiences by covering the following topics;\n\nIn March 2006, the TV unit was selected by the Women's Film Festival Committee in Paris, to screen a WMC drama called \"Live\" which focused on human trafficking of Cambodian women. This was a huge achievement for WMC.\n\nTo broaden the TV unit's capacity to produce more educational programs on demand, WMC has two TV teams, the weekly TV team (WTV) and the edutainment video team (ETV), respectively. Both teams of TV unit are managed by women. Key members of these teams including manager, editor, script writers, camera operators are also women. Most of the men involved in the teams are to help in manual work.\n\nWMC launched its first Mobile Broadcasting Units (MBUs) in 2002 to educate and inform rural communities residing in “media black spots” across Cambodia where mainstream broadcast signal could not reach or the communities have no electricity and lack financial means to purchase televisions or radios.\n\nOn average, each MBU viewing attracts 300 villagers, of which 50 percent are women. Using LCD projector, DVD player, wide screen and speakers, MBUs broadcast the radio programs and TV programs at popular meeting places in the community. This usually takes place in the evening after working hours. MBU facilitators also effectively engage the audience by discussing about the key messages of the programs through question and answer activities. This reinforces the key messages and encourages the community to carry out the advocated “call to action”. Relevant learning materials, such as posters, brochures and fliers to reinforce messages are also provided.\n\n"}
