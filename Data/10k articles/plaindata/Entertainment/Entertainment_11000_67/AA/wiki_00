Originating in sports, it has since drifted into vernacular and been borrowed heavily by the entertainment industry.\n\n\"All-star\" as a sports term refers to individual players named to an \"all-star\" roster or team representing the top performers (members of such a team were \"all stars\" from other teams) during and before the end of a season in a given sport, or to a list of top participants who played in individual sports such as golf and bowling. Events limited to such honorees are referred to as \"all-star games\" or events.\n\nIn American team sports the premier all-star games are the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, NBA All-Star Game, Pro Bowl, NHL All-Star Game, and the MLS All-Star Game. Many all-star teams, such as collegiate \"all-conference\" and All-America squads, are recognitions of performance only, without the connotation of those selected ever being teammates in a game.\n\nIn gaelic games, the term \"all-stars\" refers to the GAA GPA All Stars Awards. These awards involve picking a fantasy team consisting of the top players in each position in the various sports (Gaelic football, Ladies' Gaelic football, hurling, rounders and camogie).\n\nThe term all-star also used in films, often used as a form of publicity gimmick to promote the cast of a movie in which a number of high-profile actors appear, sometimes merely in cameo roles. An archetype is the 1956 version of \"Around the World in 80 Days\".\n\nIn television, there are a number of groups who could be considered all-stars. Many reality competition shows produce All-Stars editions, which feature notable and particularly talented contestants of past regular seasons of the show. For example, the reality game show franchise, \"Survivor\", has had several editions where some or all of the cast featured are \"All Stars\". There have been three All-Stars editions of the American reality game show \"The Amazing Race\". Other all-stars editions of U.S. shows include \"Bad Girls All-Star Battle\", \"America's Next Top Model 17\", and \"Charm School\". \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" has also had three seasons of an All Stars spin-off. The ninth series of the British television show \"Dancing on Ice\" was an All-Stars edition.\n\nAnother use for all-star contestants is to appear on other reality competition programs (especially if the shows are on the same network). This is especially prevalent on CBS's three reality competition programs, \"The Amazing Race\", \"Survivor\" and \"Big Brother\".\n\nThe term \"all-stars\" has recently been used to describe/title video games that feature large casts of iconic characters in a crossover-type setting. Notable examples include \"PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale\" and \"Warriors All-Stars\".\n\n"}

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on April 11, 2010. The episode features the Griffin family as they attempt to live out their last day on Earth, after hearing an announcement on the local news about a black hole that is sucking in the entire solar system. As the countdown approaches zero, Peter suddenly reveals his secret dislike of being in his children's presence, seconds before the world is expected to end. Then it is revealed that it is all an April Fools' joke, and Peter is left to attempt to win back his children's respect.\n\nThe episode was written by John Viener and directed by Joseph Lee. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 6.93 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by James Burkholder, Anne Hathaway and Jason Mraz, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"April in Quahog\" was released on DVD along with ten other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.\n\nThe local news reports that Stephen Hawking has discovered a new black hole at the edge of the solar system, but the Griffin family pays no attention to the announcement. Peter alerts the family that he has been selected for jury duty, which he believes is an exclusive experience. After Brian informs him that everyone serves jury duty at some point, Peter tries to be kicked out of court by annoying the others, expressing fabricated prejudices, singing Surfin' Bird, and attempting to discuss the trial outside of the courtroom. When Peter returns home that night, the local news announces that the Earth will be destroyed by the newly discovered, and continually expanding, black hole within the next 24 hours. Frantic over the news, everyone in Quahog attempts to live out the best last day possible. Herbert finally attempts to have sex with Chris, Quagmire has sex with Bonnie, and Peter finally manages to steal a lion from the zoo and say the \"you-know-what word\" in a black neighborhood (he is well respected as a result). As the countdown reaches its final seconds, Peter confesses to Lois that while he loves her, he hates spending time with his kids. Immediately afterward, the news anchors reveal the black hole report was an April Fools' joke.\n\nStunned at their father's newly revealed hatred, Meg, Chris and Stewie avoid Peter. After realizing how angry they are, Peter tries to reconcile with his kids by spending time with each of them. However, he and his kids share no common interests and Peter only makes things worse by using the methamphetamine he had wanted to share with Chris. After a heartfelt speech does not work, Peter finally buys his kids' love by giving them a new Xbox 360, and they proclaim Peter \"the best father ever\". At the end of the show, Peter plays \"\", albeit terribly, much to the other players' fury, two of them being Quagmire and Joe who tell Peter he sucks at the game.\n\nAs his first official episode for the series, the episode was directed by Joseph Lee, who had previously served as an assistant director and storyboard artist for the show. In addition, the episode was written by series regular John Viener, his second episode for the season, the first being \"Jerome is the New Black\". In promoting the episode, an image of Stan and Francine Smith meeting and speaking with Lois and Peter, along with an image of Peter, Brian, Joe and Quagmire drinking cans of beer in front of the house from \"King of the Hill\" was released by 20th Century Fox. A press release of a purported crossover was also made public. Having released the information on April Fools' Day, the crossover was revealed to be an April Fools' joke after the episode aired without a crossover occurring.\n\n\"April in Quahog\", along with the eleven other episodes from \"Family Guy\"s eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on December 13, 2011. The sets include brief audio commentaries by various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes and animatics, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating \"And Then There Were Fewer\", a mini-feature entitled \"The Comical Adventures of \"Family Guy\" – Brian & Stewie: The Lost Phone Call\", and footage of the \"Family Guy\" panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International.\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, voice actor James Burkholder, actress Anne Hathaway and singer and performer Jason Mraz guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan, Johnny Brennan, Chris Cox, Ralph Garman, writer and showrunner Mark Hentemann, voice actor Phil LaMarr, writer Chris Sheridan, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener also made minor appearances. Recurring guest voice actors Adam West and Patrick Warburton made guest appearances as well.\n\nIn the opening scene of the episode, the Griffin family is seen watching the Channel 5 News, with Tricia Takanawa then beginning an interview with Stephen Hawking. Hawking, who is paralyzed due to neuro-muscular dystrophy, is seen sitting in his wheelchair. After the camera cuts, Hawking then jumps up from his chair, and admits it is just an act, before deciding to go surfing at the nearby beach.\n\nIn mentioning that he has been summoned for jury duty, and implying its exclusivity, Peter is confronted by Brian who reveals that the only reason he was selected was because he had voted in the last election. Peter goes on to state that he actually stuffed the ballot box at the Oscars, when the nominees included Grover from \"Sesame Street\", Bluto from \"Popeye\", and Daniel Day-Lewis, among others. Actress Anne Hathaway presented the award. Going on to find out that everyone is asked to do jury duty, Peter soon seeks to be kicked out, just as he was from the rock band Coldplay once he suggested that they write a song that is \"not whiny bullcrap\". Further attempting to be kicked out of jury duty, Peter begins singing the song \"Surfin' Bird\" by The Trashmen, a song that was first introduced in the series in the seventh season episode \"I Dream of Jesus\".\n\nBefore Peter is preparing to leave for jury duty, the family is seen watching a television sitcom entitled \"How Henry Kissinger Met Your Mother\", a parody of the CBS sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\", which features Henry Kissinger, whose heavy accent makes his speech unintelligible. Once Peter is dressed for court, he explains that even the vending machines at the courthouse are out of order, with Brian then being shown dressed and laughing in a similar manner as the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Muttley.\n\nHaving learned of the impending doomsday, Mayor Adam West angrily writes an angry letter to outer space, expressing his intention of punching the constellation Orion. West then straps on a jetpack, as well as a fishbowl for his helmet, and flies into space, punching the constellation, causing the stars to form into the Orion Pictures company logo. After it is revealed by Channel 5 News that the impending doomsday was actually an April Fools' Day joke, Brian reacts by angrily yelling, \"You dicks!\", a line uttered by Jeff Spicoli, as portrayed by Sean Penn, in the 1982 comedy film \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\". Unable to win over his children's affection, Peter decides to buy them an Xbox 360 to earn the respect once more. Before the end credits, Peter is then shown playing the Xbox 360 game \"\" (Team Deathmatch on Favela), much to his children's chagrin. Peter, gamertag 'pgriffin69x', is killed by Infinity Ward's former Creative Strategist Robert Bowling, gamertag FOURZEROTWO.\n\nIn a slight decrease from the previous week, the episode was viewed in 6.93 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.4 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating \"The Simpsons\" and \"The Cleveland Show\", as well as the return episode of \"American Dad!\", which had been put into a temporary hiatus, in order to accommodate \"Sons of Tucson\". In addition, the episode significantly edged out all three shows in total viewership.\n\nReviews of the episode were mostly mixed, calling it a \"tragedy,\" but \"funnier than expected.\" Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club noted that there are \"funny lines tucked around the edges of every episode but there's nothing here that justifies the needlessly elaborate plots.\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad gave the episode a more positive review, stating that Peter's attempts to bond with his children \"brought some of the most hilarious visuals.\" Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode a much more negative review, noting that it did not \"have many redeeming qualities,\" and the jokes were \"mediocre.\" In a subsequent review of \"Family Guy\"s eighth season, Isler listed \"April in Quahog\" as being \"full of the lowest of the lowest-common-denominator 'jokes', with heavy reliance on toilet humor and the characteristic cutaway gags that have steadily gotten more random and less funny.\"\n\n"}

The game takes place in the future, where real sport has been overtaken in favour of virtual sport, the most popular of which is Assault Rigs, a tank simulator set inside a 3D virtual environment.\n\nThe goal of the single player game is to collect all of the gems in a level, while destroying or avoiding enemies, ultimately reaching the exit. There are 42 levels featuring jump ramps, elevators, skyways, trenches, movable blocks and push rods. There are 20 weapon power-ups, viruses and Dolby Surround sound. The game has four themes of tanks/environment: VR, Industrial, Military and War. \n\n\"Assault Rigs\" also has the capability to utilize the PlayStation Link Cable, enabling two players to connect two PlayStations and play head-to-head on two televisions. This setup unlocks 15 additional levels that are only available for play using the cable.\n\nThe MS-DOS version has multi-player which can be played with either a serial link (two player) or a network (up to eight players).\n\nPlayers control their rig to collect all the gems in a level and get to the end goal of each of the game's 42 levels. In the Saturn version all of the levels were the same as the PlayStation and PC versions, but they were given different names. Along the way, they can collect various types of weapons from missiles to land mines. Throughout each level, they must contend with various enemies from turrets to enemy rigs. Aerial enemies called \"viruses\" also attack the player's rig, while hazards such as electric gates and enemy mines dot each level. There are also mild puzzle-solving elements such as pushing blocks and building bridges.\n\nAir Hendrix of \"GamePro\" gave the PlayStation version a mixed review. He criticized the oversensitive controls, lack of split screen multiplayer, background flicker, and inappropriate music, but praised the diverse gameplay, focus on problem-solving, and futuristic graphics, and concluded that \"Noodling through \"Assault Rigs\" will be great fun for those who like a touch of thinking with their shooting.\" \"Maximum\" gave the game credit for its \"increasingly complex level designs\" and the diversion of the arena levels, but asserted that \"This game, while sounding quite entertaining in theory, unfortunately has a variety of problems in practice\", citing poor camera angles, glitching graphics, and an overly easy and linear progression. They gave it 3 out of 5 stars. Both \"GamePro\" and \"Maximum\" compared the game favorably to \"Cyber Sled\". \"Next Generation\"s brief review deemed the game unexciting and scored it two out of five stars.\n"}

She is Dennis' baby sister, born in issue 2931, dated 19 September 1998. She gets her own comic strip in issue 3737 dated 7 June 2014.\n\nBea's introduction to the comic began with the edition of 8 August of \"The Beano\" ensuring readers that they may be in for a big surprise. Subsequently, Dennis' strip inside revealed that his mother was in fact pregnant. Dennis, reacting to the news, fainted out of surprise. The next week the comic went through a revamp and the cover showed Dennis' father announcing that he had just become the father to a daughter. The story inside showed Dennis was worried about the news, feeling having a younger sister would tarnish his reputation as a menace. However, his family portrait revealed that his little sister, named Bea, was just as much of a troublemaker as him. These were the first Dennis strips drawn by the new artist David Parkins, who had taken over from the previous artist, David Sutherland.\n\nParkins had always intended that the character would be called \"Bea\" (short for Beatrice), taken partly from the comic's name and evidenced in the yellow-and-black striped romper suit/onesie she was seen wearing in her first appearance. However, the comic staff decided to put the name up for vote. The readers seemed to agree with Parkins, as \"Bea\" won the vote by a nearly two-thirds majority.\nDennis' Mum regularly shouts; \"Bea! No!\" whenever she does something naughty, the two words evidently making the word \"Beano\".\n\nIn issue 2935 dated 17 October 1998 Bea gained her own solo strip entitled Beaginnings drawn by Nigel Parkinson. It was here that Bea uttered her first word, \"Mud\". Bea was voted naughtiest baby in Beanotown when she was only a week old, has Gnipper as her dog, and loves playing with Rasher. But for five isolated examples, the strip has always been drawn by Nigel Parkinson, who also frequently drew the main \"Dennis\" strip at that time. Issue 2942 (5 December 1998) was a special issue dedicated to her, where she appeared in every strip in the comic.\n\nShe shares notable similarities with fellow \"Beano\" character, Ivy the Terrible, who, from August 2008, joined Bea in her strip, renamed \"Bea and Ivy\". Nigel Parkinson continued as artist, as Ivy had been reprinted before the team up. Bea's own strip returned for a few issues in 2009, however, this was dropped later that year, mainly due to her older brother's relaunch. In 2010 Bea joined up with Gnipper and Harley, Gran's pet pig, in a new strip titled The Bea Team, the title being a parody of \"The A-Team\" film which was released around the time the strip was in \"The Beano\". In 2014, Bea returned to her strip drawn by Nigel Parkinson\n\nBea makes appearances in the CBBC series \"Dennis the Menace and Gnasher\".\n\nAs a pun on her name, Bea dresses only in a yellow and black one piece with a yellow hair band to match. Her appearance is extremely similar to her elder brother's in that she sports jet-black messy hair and a behind the nose grin. After the 2009 re-launch of \"Dennis and Gnasher\", eyelashes were added to her appearance and she became far more baby-like in not only looks but also personality.\n"}

The series was renewed for a second season on July 8, 2015, which premiered on June 30, 2016.\n\nThere has been no confirmation of a third season.\n\n\"Between\" is the story of a small town called Pretty Lake and surrounding rural area under siege from a mysterious disease that has wiped out everybody aged 22 and older. The series also explores numerous themes: the power vacuum that results when the government quarantines a 10 square mile zone and leaves the inhabitants to fend for themselves; the desire of inhabitants to escape, ignoring that they will spread the deadly disease to the entire planet; and the effect of hormonal teenaged/young adult angst becoming the guiding force for an entire community.\n\n\n\nThe series was originally set for a season of six one-hour episodes, co-produced and financed by Citytv and Netflix as part of a collaboration deal. The series represents the first major television solo starring role for McCurdy.\n\nProduction of season 1 began on October 20, 2014.

It is the first series originating from Canada to air on Netflix from its inception.\n\nEpisodes air on a week by week basis on City, on Thursdays at 8 pm Eastern Time. During season 1, they were later added on week by week basis on Netflix, for international viewing at 11:30 pm Eastern. Season 1 was added to Netflix's Canadian service one year after its Shomi debut. For season 2, all six episodes were released on Netflix on July 1, 2016, outside Canada.\n\n\"Between\"s season 1 ratings on Citytv pulled a combined 3.2 million viewers, reaching roughly 10% of the Canadian population. The show performed at 31% in the desirable 18–34 age demographic, significantly above the channel average of 19% for the demographic.\n\nBrian Lowry of \"Variety\" called \"Between\" \"an utterly ho-hum addition to Netflix's original lineup\". Keith Uhlich of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote, \"It's the end of the world as they know it, and viewers won't care.\" Mike Hale of \"The New York Times\" called it a \"familiar ensemble soap opera with conspiracy-theory embroidery\". Mary McNamara of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"The town is lovely, the premise solid if overfamiliar, but the script lacks both depth and tension (big problem), and McCurdy is one of the few cast members who can act.\" Kevin P. Sullivan of \"Entertainment Weekly\" rated it C− and criticized the show's writing. Joshua Alston of \"The A.V. Club\" rated it C+ and wrote that the series lacks a compelling hook.\n"}

Due to this and the extra width of the channel allocations at UHF, the width of the guard band between the channels is 650 kHz (assuming the worst case which is when NICAM sound is in use).\n\nMany countries use a variant of system H which is known as System G. System G is similar to system H but the lower (vestigial) side band is 500 kHz narrower. This makes poor use of the 8.0 MHz channels of the UHF bands by merely increasing the width of the guard-band by 500 kHz to 1.15 MHz. The advantage(?) is that the RF spectrum of system G (on UHF) is the same as system B (on VHF), simplifying the band-switching circuitry in VHF/UHF televisions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "521983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=521983", "title": "Capture the flag", "text": "Capture the flag\n\nCapture the flag (CTF) is a traditional outdoor game where two teams each have a flag (or other marker) and the objective is to capture the other team's flag, located at the team's \"base,\" and bring it safely back to their own base. Enemy players can be \"tagged\" by players in their home territory and, depending on the rules, they may be out of the game, become members of the opposite team, sent back to their own territory, frozen in place (\"in jail\") until freed by a member of their own team.\n\nCapture the Flag requires a playing field of some sort. In both indoor and outdoor versions, the field is divided into two clearly designated halves, known as territories. Players form two teams, one for each territory. Each side has a \"flag\" which is most often a piece of fabric, but can be any object small enough to be easily carried by a person (night time games might use flashlights, glowsticks or lanterns as the \"flags\"). Sometimes teams wear dark colors at night to make it more difficult for their opponents to see them. If one team has the opposing team's flag on their territory they may be tagged because they have the opposing team's flag.\n\nThe objective of the game is for players to venture into the opposing team's territory, grab the flag and return with it to their territory without being tagged. The flag is defended mainly by tagging opposing players who attempt to take it. Within their territory players are \"safe\", meaning that they cannot be tagged by opposing players. Once they cross into the opposing team's territory they are vulnerable.\n\nThe flag is usually placed in a visibly obvious location at the rear of a team's territory. In a more difficult version, the flag is hidden in a place where it can only be seen from one angle. It also might have some challenge involved. For example, the flag could be hidden in the leaves up in a tall tree, and the players have to see the flag, then knock it out and bring it to their base.\n\nDifferent versions of Capture the Flag have different rules, both for handling the flag and for what happens to tagged players. A player who is tagged may be eliminated from the game entirely (out of the game), be forced to join the opposing team, sent back to their own territory, or be placed in \"jail\" with or without a guard (according to the number of people in a team). The jail is a predesignated area of the group's territory which exists for holding tagged players and is normally towards the back of the group's territory.\n\nWhile tagged players may be confined to jail for a limited, predetermined time, the most common form of the game involves the option for a \"jailbreak\". In this version, players who are tagged remain in jail indefinitely. However, players from their own team may free them from jail by means of a jailbreak. Jailbreaks are accomplished by a player running from their own territory into the enemy's jail. Such action may, depending on the rules, free all jailed players or simply those who are physically touched by the one performing the jailbreak. But in some variants team mates who got tagged can be jailed only 3 times or they are kicked from the game until the next round. In general freed players are obligated to return directly to their own territory before attempting offensive action (\"i.e.,\" attempting to grab the flag).\n\nWhile they return to their own side, freed players usually acquire \"free walk-backs\", in which they are safe from tagging until they reach their home territory. The player performing the jail break, on the other hand, is neither safe, nor restricted from performing other actions such as attempting to grab the flag or generally moving about enemy territory. Sometimes, players in jail form chains, so that if a teammate tags one person in the chain, everyone is free. Simply leaving jail without being freed is considered poor sportsmanship and is severely frowned upon, often leading to expulsion from the game. If all players on one team are jailed (meaning no teammate can free them from jail), then the other team will have all the time they want to find the other team's flag.\n\nThe rules for the handling of the flag also vary from game to game and deal mostly with the disposition of the flag after a failed attempt at capturing it. In one variant, after a player is tagged while carrying the flag, it is returned to its original place. In another variant, the flag is left in the location where the player was tagged. This latter variant makes offensive play easier, as the flag will tend, over the course of the game, to be moved closer to the dividing line between territories. In some games, it is possible for the players to throw the flag to teammates. As long as the flag stays in play without hitting the ground, it is allowed for the players to pass.\n\nWhen the flag is captured by one player, they're not safe from being tagged, unless they trip. Sometimes, the flag holder may not be safe at all, even in their home territory, until they obtain both flags, thus ending the game. But they have the option to return to their own side or hand it off to a teammate who will then carry it to the other side. In most versions, they may not throw the flag but only hand it off while running. The game is won when a player returns to their own territory with the enemy flag or both teams' flags. Also, as a general rule, the flag carrier may not attempt to free any of their teammates from jail.\n\nAlterations may include \"one flag\" CTF in which there is a defensive team and an offensive team, or games with three or more flags. In the case of the latter, one can only win when all flags are captured, not only one.\n\nAnother variation is when the players put bandannas in their pockets with about six inches sticking out. Instead of tagging your opponents, you must pull your opponent's bandanna out of their pocket. No matter where a player is when their bandanna is pulled, they're captured and must, depending on the preferences of the players, go to jail, or return to their base before returning to play. In this version there is no team territory, only a small base where the team's flag is kept. To win, one team must have both of the flags in their base.\n\nIn some urban settings, the game is played indoors in an enclosed area with walls, similar to the walls in a hockey rink. There is also a spot sticking out of the back of the opposing ends which is connected to the playing area for the flag to be placed in. In this urban variation, legal checking hockey style and legal checking against the boards is allowed. A player who commits a foul or illegal check is placed in a penalty box for a specified amount of time, depending on the severity of the foul. A player who deliberately injures an opponent is expelled from the rest of the game. Throwing the flag is allowed in this variation, as long as the flag is caught before it hits the ground. If the flag is thrown to a teammate but hits the ground before it can be caught, the flag is placed from the spot of the throw. If a player throws the flag, but is blocked or intercepted by a player from the opposing team, the flag is placed back at the base.\n\nIt is not uncommon for airsoft, paintball, Nerf and water warriors to play CTF. Typically there are no territories in these versions. Players who are \"hit\" must sit out a predetermined amount of time before returning to play (respawning).\n\n\"Stealing sticks\" is a similar game played in the British Isles, the United States, and Australia. However, instead of a flag, a number of sticks or other items such as coats or hats are placed in a \"goal\" on the far end of each side of the playing field or area. As in capture the flag, players are sent to a \"prison\" if tagged on the opponents' side, and may be freed by teammates. Each player may only take one of their opponents' sticks at a time. The first team to take all of the opponents' sticks to their own side wins.\n\nIn 1984, Scholastic published \"Bannercatch\" for the Apple II and Commodore computers. An edutainment game with recognizable capture-the-flag mechanics, \"Bannercatch\" allows up to two humans (each alternating between two characters in the game world) to play capture the flag against an increasingly difficult team of four AI bots. \"Bannercatch\"s game world is divided into quadrants: home, enemy, and two \"no-mans land\" areas which hold the jails. A successful capture requires bringing the enemy flag into one team's \"home\" quadrant. Players can be captured when in an enemy territory, or in \"no-mans land\" while holding a flag. Captured players must be \"rescued\" from their designated jail by one of the other members of the team. Fallen flags remain where they dropped until a time-out period elapses, after which the flag returns to one of several starting locations in home territory. The 2D map also features walls, trees and a moving river, enabling a wide variety of strategies. Special locations in the play area allow humans to query the game state (such as flag status) using binary messages.\n\nIn 1992, Richard Carr released an MS-DOS based game called \"Capture the Flag\". It is a turn-based strategy game with real time network / modem play (or play-by-mail) based around the traditional outdoor game. The game required players to merely move one of their characters onto the same square as their opponent's flag, as opposed to bringing it back to friendly territory, because of difficulties implementing the artificial intelligence that the computer player would have needed to bring the enemy flag home and intercept opposing characters carrying the flag. The 2013 videogame \"TagPro\" revisited the genre.\n\nIn computer security, Capture the Flag (CTF), a type of cryptosport, is a computer security competition. CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world. Reverse-engineering, network sniffing, protocol analysis, system administration, programming, and cryptanalysis are all skills which have been required by prior CTF contests at DEF CON. There are two main styles of capture the flag competitions: attack/defense and Jeopardy!.\n\nIn an attack/defense style competition, each team is given a machine (or a small network) to defend on an isolated network. Teams are scored on both their success in defending their assigned machine and on their success in attacking the other team's machines. Depending on the nature of the particular CTF game, teams may either be attempting to take an opponent's flag from their machine or teams may be attempting to plant their own flag on their opponent's machine. Two of the more prominent attack/defense CTF's are held every year at DEF CON, the largest hacker conference, and the NYU-CSAW (Cyber Security Awareness Week), the largest student cyber-security contest.\nJeopardy!-style competitions usually involve multiple categories of problems, each of which contains a variety of questions of different point values and difficulties. Teams attempt to earn the most points in the competition's time frame (for example 24 hours), but do not directly attack each other. Rather than a race, this style of game play encourages taking time to approach challenges and prioritizes quantity of correct submissions over the timing.\n\nCapture the Flag is among the games that have made a recent comeback among adults as part of the urban gaming trend (which includes games like Pac-Manhattan, Fugitive and Manhunt). The game is played on city streets and players use cellphones to communicate. News about the games spreads virally through the use of blogs and mailing lists. Urban Capture the Flag has been played in cities throughout North America. One long running example occurs on the Northrop Mall at the University of Minnesota on Fridays with typical attendance ranging from 50 to several hundred.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "739711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=739711", "title": "Ecco the Dolphin", "text": "Ecco the Dolphin\n\nEcco the Dolphin is an action-adventure game originally developed by Ed Annunziata and Novotrade International for the Sega Genesis known as the Mega Drive in regions outside of North America and published by Sega in 1992. \"Ecco the Dolphin\" was republished digitally via Nintendo's Virtual Console in 2006, Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade, Steam, iOS, and Nintendo 3DS.\n\nIt is the first installment in the \"Ecco the Dolphin\" video game franchise. The player character is a bottlenose dolphin who travels through time to combat hostile extraterrestrials in Earth's oceans and on an alien spacecraft.\n\nAttacking enemies is accomplished by making Ecco ram into them at high speeds. Swimming can be made progressively faster by tapping a certain button, and the speed can be maintained by holding it down. Players can perform a purely aesthetic spin in the air when jumping out of the water.\n\nTwo features of the game play on actual dolphin habits; one button causes Ecco to sing, allowing him to speak with other cetaceans and interact with certain objects. The same button is used for echolocation; holding it down causes the song to return, generating a map of the area. Several levels contain enormous crystals called \"glyphs\", which respond in different ways if Ecco touches or sings to them. Some block paths, and a \"Key-Glyph\" must be found in such cases to pass. Others give information, and a few in later levels replenish health/air and give Ecco temporary invulnerability.\n\nAdditionally, Ecco, being a mammal, must surface periodically for air, or else find an air vent. If the \"air meter\" runs out, Ecco loses health rapidly, which represented drowning. His health is measured by a separate meter (above the air meter); it is depleted by enemies or when his air meter runs out, and it is recharged by eating fish, \"singing\" to clams, or, later in the game, singing to special statues or crystals called \"glyphs\". Ecco's song can be optionally upgraded at two points in the game: one upgrade allows Ecco's song to be used in combination with a charge as a long-range weapon, and the other temporarily disorients sharks and makes minor enemies freeze temporarily. Touching any enemy by any means other than an attack causes Ecco to sustain damage. The enemies range from seahorses to giant octopodes.\n\nThe penultimate level of the game is titled \"Welcome to the Machine\", named after \"Welcome to the Machine\", a song on Pink Floyd's 1975 studio album \"Wish You Were Here\". \"\" (1994) features a level called \"New Machine\", named after \"A New Machine\", a two-part song on Pink Floyd's 1987 album \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\".\n\nThe game begins with Ecco, a bottlenose dolphin, as he and his pod are swimming in their home bay. One podmate challenges him to see how high into the air he can jump. When he is in the air, a waterspout forms and sucks up all marine life in the bay except Ecco, leaving him alone in the bay. Upon leaving the bay to search for his pod, he contacts several dolphins from other pods, who tell him the entire sea is in chaos, and that all marine creatures had felt the storm. An orca tells Ecco to travel to the Arctic to find a blue whale named the \"Big Blue\", who is revered among marine mammals for its age and wisdom. Once Ecco finds him, the Big Blue tells him such storms had been occurring every 500 years and directs him to the Asterite, the oldest creature on Earth. He leaves the Arctic and travels to a deep cavern where he finds the Asterite. Although it has the power to aid him, one of its globes is missing, and needs it returned. However, this can only be achieved by traveling back in time using a machine built by the ancient Atlanteans.\n\nEcco travels to the sunken city of Atlantis, where he discovers the time machine and an ancient library. He learns the cause of the storm; it was a harvest of Earth's waters that was conducted every 500 years by an alien species known as the Vortex. The Vortex had lost their ability to make their own food, and so every 500 years, they would harvest from the waters of Earth. Learning this, he activates the time machine and travels 55 million years into Earth's past. While Ecco is in the past he learns an ancient song to communicate is a Pteranodon. Ecco locates the Asterite in the past but is immediately attacked by it. Forced into battle, he manages to dislodge a globe from it. This opens a time portal and he is sent back into the present. After receiving the globe, the Asterite grants him the power to turn his sonar into a deadly weapon against the Vortex, as well as the abilities to breathe underwater and to slowly regenerate lost health. The Asterite instructs him to use the time machine to travel back in time to the hour of the harvest. This time he manages to be sucked into the waterspout with his pod. Once inside the waterspout, Ecco makes his way towards the Vortex Queen, the leader of the Vortex race. Ecco destroys the Vortex Queen and his pod returns home.\n\nThe existence of \"Ecco the Dolphin\" had been heavily rumored throughout the industry before it was finally revealed by Sega in 1992 as a Genesis exclusive, then simply known as \"Dolphin\". After deciding to create a game based around dolphins, developer Ed Annunziata carried out research on the subject and was particularly inspired by the book \"Sounding\" by Hank Searls which explained how the creatures use echolocation. Annunziata worked with the music team on the soundtrack, playing them songs by Pink Floyd to illustrate the feeling he was aiming for. Annunziata later said, \"I was paranoid about game rentals and kids beating the game over the weekend. So.. I.. uh... made it hard.\" His favourite level was Welcome to the Machine, which was \"way over the top challenging\"\n\nThe name Ecco comes from John C. Lilly, where, during his experiments with psychoactive drugs, he claims to have met a series of cosmic entities dubbed Earth Coincidence Control Office (E.C.C.O.). In his life, Lilly was involved in extensive research involving dolphins, compiling his work's findings in the book The Mind of the Dolphin. The game takes much inspiration from Lilly's work with dolphins and his experiments with psychedelic substances. Ed Annunziata himself has stated on his Facebook page: \"I did read a lot from John C Lilly.\"\n\n\"Ecco the Dolphin\" was originally released in 1992 for the Sega Genesis (a.k.a. Mega Drive).\n\nSega Game Gear and Master System versions were also released; they feature different levels from the other versions and a special intro featuring a whale song, and dolphin noises for the title screen. The Game Gear version has a dolphin \"SEGA\" on the SEGA screen and dolphins laughing on the title screen, along with a new soundtrack by Csaba Gigor and Gábor Foltán, as well as a wider color gamut.\n\nAn enhanced Sega CD version that features new and redesigned levels and an alternate Red Book audio soundtrack, composed by Spencer Nilsen, was also released. This version was later ported to Windows. The Windows port was further enhanced with higher resolution graphics. In 2014 a fan-made fixed and enhanced version, dubbed \"Ecco PC Fixed & Enhanced Edition\", became available for newer versions like Windows 10.\n\n\"Ecco the Dolphin\", along with \"\" and \"Ecco Jr.\", can be found on the PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable game \"Sega Genesis Collection\".\n\nIn 2002, Sega's first attempt to enter the downloadable retail game content business occurred on RealOne Arcade. The first few titles released included \"Ecco the Dolphin\", \"Columns III\" and \"Shinobi III.\" These downloadable releases came in one-hour trial versions.\n\n\"Ecco the Dolphin\" was released in Europe and Australia for the Virtual Console on Nintendo's Wii console on December 8, 2006 for 800 Wii Points. It was released in North America on November 28, 2006 for 800 Wii Points, and in Japan on December 2, 2006 for 600 Wii Points.\n\n\"Ecco the Dolphin\" was released on the Xbox Live Arcade on August 15, 2007 for the Xbox 360.\n\n\"Ecco the Dolphin\" is part of \"Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection\" for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, along with its sequel.\n\n\"3D Ecco the Dolphin\" is a port of the game for the Nintendo 3DS as part of Sega's 3D Classics line. Along with stereoscopic 3D graphics and the option to choose between Japanese and International versions of the game, the port also adds 'Super Dolphin Mode', which decreases the difficulty by giving players invincibility and unlimited oxygen. The game was released on the Nintendo eShop in Japan on June 26, 2013, and in North America and Europe on December 12, 2013.\n\nIn 1996 a soundtrack album combining music from both \"Ecco the Dolphin\" and \"Ecco: The Tides of Time\" was released, under the title \"Ecco: Songs of Time\".\n\nThe Sega Mega Drive version became a bestseller. \"Mega\" placed the game at #24 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time. On release, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored the Mega-CD version of the game a 27 out of 40.\n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" called the PC release \"little more than a conversion from the yesteryears of the 16-bit Sega Genesis. Except for a few video cut-scenes, there is little attempt to make this game look or play better for the PC.\" He nonetheless praised the game not only for its novel concept and responsive controls, but also \"its smooth graphics\".\n\nNintendo Official Magazine Staff (2001). \"Nintendo Official Magazine\" - Nintendo's Market Share 1988.

{"id": "6667862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6667862", "title": "Gonggi", "text": "Gonggi\n\nGonggi (공기, pronounced gong-gee) is a popular Korean children's game that is traditionally played using 5 or more small grape-sized pebbles. Nowadays, children buy colourful plastic stones instead of finding pebbles. It can be played alone or with friends. The stones are called \"gonggitdol\" (), which means \"gonggi stones.\" Since only a few stones and a flat surface are needed for play, the game can be played by anyone almost anywhere. This same game also exists in Nepal and it is called 'gatti'.\n\nThey are called 'Jjagebatgi' in Gyeongsangbuk-do, 'Salgu' in Gyeongsang-nam-do, and 'Datjjakgeoli' in Jeollanam-do.\n\nThe game generally begins with each player tossing the stones from the palm of their hand into the air. While airborne, the player switches his hand backside up. The gonggi stones are then caught on the back of the hand. The person with the leading amount plays first.\n\n\nWhile the stones are airborne, the player switches their hand backside up, catches several stones, switches their hand backside down, and catches the stones that are left over.\nWhile the stones are airborne, the player claps their hand before catching the stones.\n\nBoth “dragon” and “clap-toss” gives the player twice the score; twice the number of stones.\n\nWe call this game crisis because when a player reaches a certain score, the player has to go through crisis. In Korea, the crisis scores are usually the multiples of 5(5, 10, 15, ... ) or numbers that include 3, 6, or 9(3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 19, 23, 26, 29, 30, ….). When a player reaches a crisis score, the rules become different:\n\nSince other players don’t want the player to earn more points, they choose the stone that is the hardest for the player to carry on. For example, in the first level, if two stones touch each other, other players make sure not to choose either one of the two stones. As a result, the player has to go through a crisis of needing to grab each stone without touching the other stone.\n\nOther players try to throw the stone with accuracy and strength in order to make the other 4 stones scatter. The more they scatter, the harder it is for the player to grab at 4 stones at once.\n\n\nThis game is usually introduced to children before they learn how to play gonggi. The main and the only difference between snail and gonggi is how to grab the stone. In snail, the edge of the player’s hand has to be stuck on the ground at every step. Instead of throwing a stone up in the air, the player sweeps his hand across the ground in a large circle and grabs a certain number of stones. The number of stones the player has to grab at once is same as gonggi. Snail is an easy way to make oneself familiar with the number of stones one has to catch at each level.\n\nThis game is taught to people who are adept in playing gonggi. The difference from gonggi is that the player doesn’t throw one stone in the air but all stones that are in the player’s hand. After throwing multiple stones, the player grabs other stone(s) from the ground and catches all the stones they threw. Like snail, the number of stones the player has to grab is same as gonggi.\n\nThere are many playing calls in the Gonggi game. The standard calls have been listed here. The penalty for a \"mess–up\" requires that the player who has perpetrated it pass the stones to the next player.\n\n\n"}

They spun off into their own strip, written by Walker and drawn by Browne. Lois Flagston (née Bailey) is Beetle Bailey's sister, and the two strips make occasional crossovers. One of these occurred on the strip's 40th anniversary in 1994, when Beetle visited his sister Lois and her family. Chip resembles his Uncle Beetle in attitude and appearance, especially the eyes.\nThe strip made efforts to keep up with the times, such as housewife Lois Flagston taking a career in real estate in 1980. In previous decades the strip was acclaimed; in 1962 it earned Browne a Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society.\n\nThe strip faced some controversy given the changes in content restrictions since its debut in the 1950s. Once, editors insisted that belly buttons could not appear; in protest, Browne included a box of dimpled navel oranges.\n\nNow produced by the sons of the original creative team, the strip is written by Brian and Greg Walker, and drawn by Robert \"Chance\" Browne and Eric Reaves.\n\nAs of 2016, \"Hi and Lois\" appears in 1,000 newspapers around the world.\n\nThe Flagston family was also featured in a series of Charlton comic books.

Eventually Okuni joined as a \"miko\", where she was known for her skill in dancing and acting, as well as her beauty. As it was a custom of the time to send priests, \"miko\" and others to solicit contributions for the shrine, she was sent to Kyoto to perform sacred dances and songs.\n\nIt was during her performances in Kyoto that she also became known for her performances of \"nembutsu odori\" (or \"nembutsu\" dance) in honor of the Amida Buddha. Though this dance traces its origins to Kūya, a tenth-century evangelist of Pure Land Buddhism, by Okuni's time it had become a largely secular folk dance, and her particular adaptation tended to be known for its sultriness and sexual innuendo. Other popular themes for Okuni's acts included humorous skits about lover's trysts at various public establishments and meetings between men and prostitutes. Between these and other dances and acts, she garnered much attention and began to draw large crowds wherever she performed. Eventually she was summoned to return to the shrine, a call she ignored, though she continued to send money back.\n\nAround 1603, Okuni began performing on the dry riverbed of the Shijōgawara (Fourth Street Dry Riverbed) of the Kamo River and at Kitano Shrine. Gathering up the female outcasts and misfits of the region, particularly those involved in prostitution, Okuni gave them direction, teaching them acting, dancing and singing skills in order to form her troupe. Several theories exist as to the etymology of the word \"kabuki,\" one being that it is derived from those who, oddly dressed and swaggering on the street, had been dubbed \"kabukimono\" (from \"kabuku\" \"to lean in a certain direction\", and \"mono\", \"people\"). Another possible origin is \"katamuki,\" which means \"slanted\" or \"strongly-inclined.\" In either case, others labeled Okuni's troupe's performances kabuki due to their eccentricity and social daring. The earliest performances of kabuki were dancing and song with no significant plot, often disdained as gaudy and cacophonous, but equally lauded as colorful and beautiful.\n\nAs mentioned above, Okuni's troupe was exclusively female. Thus, she required her actresses to play both male and female roles. As her troupe gained fame, she was emulated by many others, particularly brothels, which offered such shows to amuse wealthy clients, as well as to gain prostitutes who had marketable acting and singing skills. This new style of exclusively female troupes became known by the alternative names of \"shibai, onnakabuki,\" (from \"onna,\" the Japanese word for \"woman\" or \"girl\") and \"Okuni kabuki.\"\n\nEventually, with the aid of Nagoya Sansaburō, who supported Okuni financially as well as artistically, kabuki evolved into a more dramatic style. On a more personal level, Sansaburō was also said to be Okuni's lover, though they never married. After his death she continued without him, continuing to merge the drama with the music and dance. Eventually, her fame and that of her kabuki troupe spread throughout Japan.\n\nOkuni retired around 1610, and after that time she disappeared. In 1629, due to public outcry for moral reform, those under the shōgun Tokugawa Iemitsu forbade women from performing in kabuki. They were quickly replaced by young men as actors/\"actresses,\" though this was soon banned as well due to some of the same issues of prostitution and corruption of morals, restricting the performances to those by older men, which is a standing practice in the official theatres even today.\n\nThere are several theories of Okuni's year of death: some say in 1613, others in 1640 or 1658.\n\nIn November 2002 a statue was erected in her honor and to commemorate 400 years of kabuki. Diagonally across from the Minami-za, the last remaining kabuki theater in Kyoto, it stands at the east end of a bridge (Shijō Ōhashi) crossing the Kamo River in Kyoto.\n\nIn addition to her founding of kabuki, Okuni contributed to Japanese theatre in general. She is said to have introduced the forerunner of the \"hanamichi\" (path of flowers), a runway leading from the rear of the theatre and crossing between the audience to the stage. This has been incorporated in several Japanese theatre arts beyond that of kabuki.\n\n"}

After his significant weight loss attributed to eating Subway sandwiches, Fogle was made a spokesperson for the company's advertising campaigns from 2000 to 2015.\n\nFogle's tenure with Subway ended after he was investigated for paying for sex with minors and receiving child pornography in 2015. On August 19, 2015, he agreed to plead guilty in federal court to possessing child pornography and traveling to pay for sex with minors. Fogle formally pleaded guilty to the charges on November 19, 2015, and was sentenced to serve 15 years, 8 months in federal prison, with a minimum of 13 years before becoming eligible for early release.\n\nFogle was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Norman and Adrienne Fogle. He has a younger brother and sister. He was raised in a Jewish home. He became a Bar Mitzvah while on a trip to Israel, and then was confirmed by his Conservative-Reconstructionist synagogue.\n\nIn 1995, Fogle graduated from North Central High School in Indianapolis. He graduated from Indiana University in 2000 and then worked briefly in the revenue management department at American Trans Air.\n\nFogle first came to media attention in April 1999, via an article written by a former dorm-mate about Fogle's weight loss and published in the \"Indiana Daily Student\". Subsequently, Fogle was featured in a \"Men's Health\" magazine article, \"Stupid Diets ... that Work!\" According to the article, Fogle had become obese through lack of exercise and eating junk food.\n\nFogle changed his eating habits upon the switch to eating at Subway by eating smaller portions that were free of high-calorie condiments such as mayonnaise. While following this diet, he lost over . A Chicago-area Subway franchisee took Fogle's story to Subway's Chicago-based advertising agency.\nAs a test, the company ran a regional television advertising campaign. The first ad aired on January 1, 2000, introducing Fogle and his story with the following disclaimer: \"The Subway diet, combined with a lot of walking, worked for Jared. We're not saying this is for everyone. You should check with your doctor before starting any diet program. But it worked for Jared.\"\n\nBecause the introductory test-ads were a success, Fogle subsequently appeared in more television commercials as well as sponsored in-store appearances throughout the United States. He gave talks on the benefits of fitness and healthy eating.\n\nIn 2002, Fogle was the subject of an episode of \"South Park\" titled \"Jared Has Aides\". Fogle has stated that while the episode had \"typical[ly] tasteless humor,\" the fact that an entire episode was devoted to him was \"very flattering.\" He added, \"you know you've made it when shows like \"South Park\" start parodying you.\"\n\nIn February 2008, a Subway campaign called \"Tour de Pants\" celebrated Fogle maintaining his weight loss for a decade. As part of the campaign, Fogle made an announcement that he would retire his pair of pants to a museum at the end of the advertising tour. Beginning in 2008, Fogle's presence in Subway advertisements decreased due to the company's placing a new emphasis on its \"$5 Footlong\" promotion.\n\nFogle's role in Subway afforded him some other opportunities, such as appearances in WWE in 2009 and 2011. By 2013, Fogle had filmed more than 300 commercials and continued to make appearances and speeches for the company. Subway attributed one third to one half of its growth in sales to Fogle, with revenue having tripled from 1998 to 2011.\n\nFogle has also made appearances in the \"Sharknado\" film series, beginning with \"\". He also had a cameo appearance in \"\", though this was cut from the Syfy Channel broadcast version a week before the premiere when his house was searched by the FBI.\n\nIn 2004, Fogle established the Jared Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on raising awareness about childhood obesity through educational programs and tools provided to parents, schools, and community organizations.\n\nOn April 29, 2015, Russell Taylor, director of the Jared Foundation, was arrested at his Indianapolis home on charges of child exploitation, possession of child pornography, and voyeurism. Fogle severed all ties with him immediately following the arrest. Taylor attempted suicide on May 6, 2015, at the Marion County Jail and was placed on life support. Taylor pleaded guilty to the charges on September 1, 2015, and on December 10, 2015, was sentenced to 27 years in federal prison.\n\nIn August 2015, a \"USA Today\" article reported that the Jared Foundation had not issued any grants nor had it given funds for its stated purpose. The article further noted that, on average, the foundation spent $73,000 a year, with the majority of that figure paying the salary of the foundation's executive director. More than one-quarter of the funds were unaccounted for per the foundation's tax records. The Secretary of State of Indiana dissolved the organization in February 2012 because it did not pay the required five-dollar annual reporting fees during the two previous years, despite being requested to do so on multiple occasions.\n\nDaniel Borochoff, president of the non-profit charity watchdog group CharityWatch, was quoted by \"USA Today\" as saying, \"If Jared was really interested in helping children through his foundation, he could have gotten more money. As with a lot of celebrities, the charity appears to be more about image-enhancement than charitable deeds.\"\n\nFogle first came to the attention of law enforcement in 2007, when reporter Rochelle Herman-Walrond told police in Sarasota, Florida, that he had made salacious comments to her about middle school-aged girls at a school health event she was covering for a local news station. She made recordings of Fogle's remarks and saved text messages between them, and then went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), where agents asked her to wear a wiretap during her conversations with him. Herman-Walrond befriended Fogle and, for the next four years, surreptitiously recorded her conversations with him as part of an ongoing federal investigation. She recorded him making several remarks about having had sex with underage girls and asking her to install a webcam in her children's rooms so he could watch them. Ultimately, however, the FBI could not pursue a case against Fogle using the recordings, because they needed more substantive evidence against him.\n\nDuring the investigation into Russell Taylor's child pornography operation, authorities discovered that Taylor had traded sexually explicit photos and videos of children, some as young as six, with Fogle. Taylor, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison, was later named an unindicted co-conspirator in the FBI's case against Fogle. \"What we found in Russell Taylor's home and on his computers led us to Jared Fogle,\" said Tim Horty, a spokesman for the United States Department of Justice.\n\nOn July 7, 2015, the FBI and Indiana State Police investigators raided Fogle's Zionsville, Indiana, residence; computers and other electronic equipment were removed from his home. The same day, a spokesperson for Subway announced that the company and Fogle had mutually agreed to suspend their business relationship. Subsequently, Subway removed all references to Fogle from its website.\n\nFollowing Fogle's arrest, the FBI also subpoenaed a series of text messages made in 2008 between Fogle and Subway franchisee Cindy Mills, with whom he was having a sexual relationship at the time; in these messages, Fogle talked about sexually abusing children ranging in age from nine to 16, told her to sell herself for sex on Craigslist and asked her to arrange for him to have sex with her 16-year-old cousin. Mills' lawyer said that she had alerted Subway's corporate management about the text messages, but that they had responded that because Fogle was not a Subway employee, there was no violation. Subway representatives said they had no record of Mills's allegations.\n\nOn August 19, 2015, federal prosecutors announced they had reached a deal with Fogle in which he would plead guilty to two counts, one of distribution and receipt of child pornography and one of traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor—specifically, from Indiana to New York City, where he is charged with paying to engage in sexual acts with a 17-year-old girl.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Fogle offered adult prostitutes a finder's fee to find him younger sex partners.\n\nAccording to documents released by federal prosecutors, Fogle has also agreed to pay a total of $1.4 million in restitution—$100,000 to each victim. Fogle faced up to 50 years in prison had he gone to trial; however, as part of the plea deal—which was not binding on the sentencing judge—prosecutors agreed to seek no more than 12 years. In return, Fogle agreed to a minimum sentence of five years. Soon after the plea deal was announced, Subway announced via Twitter that it had completely severed ties with Fogle. As a condition of his plea deal, Fogle would be restricted to supervised contact or communication with minors upon approval of his probation officer. Supervised visits with his own children would be allowed only with approval of their mother. Fogle had already made a request to visit his two children in September, but McLaughlin contested it. Upon release from prison, Fogle will be required to register as a sex offender for the remainder of his life and undergo treatment for sexual disorders.\n\nOn November 19, 2015, Fogle formally pleaded guilty before federal judge Tanya Walton Pratt. In a statement, Fogle apologized for his crimes, saying that he wanted a chance to become a \"good, honest person\" and \"redeem [his] life\" after being ensnared in a life of \"deception, lies and complete self-centeredness.\" According to Dr. John Bradford, a forensic psychiatrist who testified for Fogle's defense team, Fogle suffered from a compulsive eating disorder for several years before losing weight, and replaced food with a sense of \"hypersexuality,\" which included \"mild\" or \"weak\" pedophilia. That diagnosis was not accepted by experts in the psychiatry field and was criticized by Pratt and on social media. Liberty Behavioral Health Corp. psychologist Adam Deming suggested that Bradford had meant to say that Fogle's primary sexual attraction was to early teenagers, but that he had a lesser attraction to younger children.\n\nPratt sentenced him to 15 years, 8 months in prison, more than three years more than what prosecutors had sought, and three times what Fogle had requested. \"The level of perversion and lawlessness exhibited by Mr. Fogle is extreme,\" Pratt said. Fogle must serve a minimum of 13 years before becoming eligible for time off with good behavior. After serving his sentence, he will be on supervised release for the rest of his life. Pratt also fined him $175,000 and ordered him to forfeit $50,000 in assets (a total of $225,000), in addition to the $1.4 million restitution.\n\nFogle's lawyer, Ron Elberger, filed a notice of appeal on December 14, 2015. Fogle is able to appeal the sentence since it is longer than the maximum sentence recommended by the prosecutors. The appeal brief was due by January 25, 2016, but Fogle asked for an extension for his appeal after Elberger was diagnosed with cancer. The extension was granted. After the appeal was filed, the U.S. Attorney's office responded by opposing any sentence reduction. The office cited Fogle's text messages to a woman, in which Fogle stated he would \"pay big\" if she could procure 14-year-old children, and that he \"craved\" underage Asian girls. In these text messages, he also expressed sexual interest in young boys, although there is to date no evidence that he paid for sex with male children.\n\nOn June 9, 2016, Fogle's sentence was upheld by a federal appeals court.\n\nFogle's lawyers recommended that he serve his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood near Littleton, Colorado; it has a program for sex offenders. Pratt agreed with the recommendations, but she had no authority to determine where Fogle would serve his sentence.\n\nOn November 21, 2015, Fogle arrived at the Henderson County, Kentucky Detention Center, where he was held on a temporary basis. Fogle entered Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) custody, going to Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City, on December 15, 2015.\n\nOn December 18, Fogle was transferred to FCI Englewood. Fogle's BOP number is 12919-028. His earliest possible release date is July 11, 2029, a month before his 52nd birthday.\n\nIn March 2016, Fogle was assaulted by another inmate, Steven Nigg, reportedly because Nigg hates child molesters. The attack left Fogle with a bleeding nose, swollen face and scratches on his neck. Nigg was then transferred to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, before being transferred to FCI Safford in Safford, Arizona.\n\nOn November 8, 2017, Pratt dismissed a motion filed by Fogle hoping to overturn his convictions by stating that the federal court did not have jurisdiction to convict him. She also dismissed another motion filed on behalf of Fogle by fellow inmate Frank Pate stating the court did not have jurisdiction because of Fogle's status as a purported \"sovereign citizen.\"\n\nThe parents of one of Fogle's victims filed a civil lawsuit against Fogle for personal injury and emotional distress. Fogle filed a motion arguing that the parents are actually liable for the injuries because the parents fought and abused alcohol in front of the daughter.\n\nOn October 24, 2016, Kathleen McLaughlin's lawyers filed suit against Subway in Indiana. The suit alleges that Subway violated McLaughlin's privacy and property rights, and caused personal injury to McLaughlin by covering up at least three instances of Fogle's illegal behavior that were reported to senior management, including the allegation that Subway's senior vice president of marketing hushed up a 2004 incident in which Fogle propositioned a young girl at a promotional event at a Subway franchise in Las Vegas. The lawsuit was dismissed in October 2017, with the judge writing that the court lacked jurisdiction, since their principal business operations were outside Indiana.\n\nState of New York authorities could charge Fogle with committing state crimes related to Victims 13 and 14; since it would be the state government rather than the federal government, doing so would not violate double jeopardy. Potential state crimes would include statutory rape and/or trafficking persons for sexual reasons. New York defense attorney and former assistant district attorney Matthew R. Smalls stated that New York State is unlikely to bring state charges since it would have to make a new investigation and get testimony from victims. Abby Phillip of the \"Washington Post\" stated \"As a legal matter, Fogle may never be charged with rape — or legally labeled with having committed that crime.\"\n\nFogle married Elizabeth Christie, a pediatric nurse, on October 14, 2001; the couple divorced on October 18, 2007. In November 2009, Fogle became engaged to Kathleen \"Katie\" McLaughlin, a teacher.\n\nIn January 2010, \"People\" reported that Fogle had gained back and planned to lose it by way of his Subway weight-loss program for his upcoming wedding. Fogle and McLaughlin married in August 2010 and had two children together: a son, Brady (born 2011), and a daughter, Quinn (born 2013).\n\nIn 2013 Fogle had a net worth of $15 million.\n\nOn August 19, 2015, following Fogle's appearance in federal court on charges of sex with minors and child pornography, his wife released a statement through her attorney announcing that she was seeking a divorce. She added that she was focused \"exclusively on the well-being of my children\" and would have no further comment. Their divorce was finalized on November 16, 2015; Fogle agreed to pay his now ex-wife $7 million. According to court filings, she had traveled out of state before Fogle's guilty plea, and opted to stay in an undisclosed location to protect herself and the children from the \"media circus\" surrounding Fogle's crimes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14834828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14834828", "title": "John Cort (impresario)", "text": "John Cort (impresario)\n\nJohn Cort (ca. 1861 – November 17, 1929) was an American impresario; his Cort Circuit was one of the first national theater circuits. Along with John Considine and Alexander Pantages, Cort was one of the Seattle-based entrepreneurs who parlayed their success in the years following the Klondike Gold Rush into an impact on America's national theater scene. While Considine and Pantages focused mainly on vaudeville, Cort focused on legitimate theater. At one time, he owned more legitimate theaters than anyone else in the United States, and he eventually became part of the New York theatrical establishment. As of 2016, his Cort Theatre remains a fixture of Broadway.\n\nThe New York City-born Cort started his career as a stage actor of little distinction and as part of a comedy duo, Cort and Murphy. He first became a theater manager in Cairo, Illinois, then headed west to take over the Standard Theater, a Seattle box house (a cross between a variety theater, a saloon, and—often—a brothel), which he turned into the city's leading such establishment. A pioneer of theater circuits—booking the same act successively into multiple cities to make it worth their while to tour to his remote part of the country—he was so successful that in 1888 he built a new 800-seat Standard Theater at the southeast corner of Occidental and Washington streets. This was Seattle's first theater with electric lighting, more modern than the gas-lit Frye's Opera House, the city's leading legitimate theater at the time.\n\nThe Great Seattle Fire (June 6, 1889) burned this new Standard and nearly all of Seattle's other places of entertainment. Cort reopened two weeks later in a tent, and by November he had erected a replacement for the Standard.\n\nLike John Considine, Cort left Seattle during the depression (and anti-vice reaction) that followed the Panic of 1893, but returned after the Klondike Gold Rush to build the Grand Opera House (opened 1900) on Cherry Street. Geographically he had crossed north of \"the Deadline\", Yesler Way, out of the vice-ridden \"restricted zone\". Artistically, he had crossed from variety entertainment into legitimate theater.\n\nWith Considine, he played a major role in one of the country's rising fraternal organizations: just before the turn of the century they founded what became the Fraternal Order of Eagles (F.O.E.). A third founder, H. L. Leavitt, soon bolted to found the Loyal Order of Moose.\nBy 1903, Cort's Northwestern Theatrical Association controlled 37 theaters in the American West, allowing him to compete with some success against the Eastern entertainment establishment. He signed an agreement with Marcus Klaw and Abraham Erlanger, then the country's leading booking agents of dramatic talent, and his theaters became part of the Klaw and Erlanger Circuit. At this point, he was Seattle's leading theatrical impresario. However, Klaw and Erlanger were more focused on box-office potential than artistic merit, and Cort's position in the market had given him an audience with some critical faculties. If people were being offered badly produced plays, they would skip legitimate theater entirely and go see a vaudeville.\n\nIn 1910, Cort helped organize the Independent National Theatre Owner's Association, a group of circuits that tried to break away from the New York-based syndicates. Allied with the independent Shubert Organization, these added up to 1200 theaters nationally. They eventually forced Klaw and Erlanger to allow theaters to book both Klaw/Erlanger productions and others. Still, while the fight was on, Klaw and Erlanger had backed construction of Seattle's new Metropolitan Theatre in the prestigious Metropolitan Tract. Cort, in turn, headed for New York, where he became a notable producer and manager, as well as the founder of New York's Cort Theatre.\n\nIn the summers of 1916-1918, Ruby Stevens (the future Barbara Stanwyck), travelled with the show, watching her elder sister Mildred perform.\n\nCort's Grand Opera House suffered several fires; one of these, in 1917, gutted it, and the building has been a parking garage since 1923. The Moore Theatre, Cort's last Seattle flagship, is still going strong as of 2007.\n"}
{"id": "44971755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44971755", "title": "Ken Carson", "text": "Ken Carson\n\nKen Carson (November 14, 1914 – April 7, 1994) was an American entertainer primarily known for singing Western music. He was an early member of the Sons of the Pioneers, appearing with that group in 22 of Roy Rogers' films. His voice was featured on their iconic recordings of Tumbling Tumbleweeds and Cool Water.\n\nCarson was born Hubert Paul Flatt on November 14, 1914 in Centrahoma, Oklahoma. When he was a few weeks old, his family moved to the oil boom town of Drumright, Oklahoma, where they lived for a time in a tent. Much of his childhood was spent in Wichita, Kansas, living with his maternal grandparents. It was there at age 12 or 13 that he became an accomplished musician, playing guitar and harmonica, and organizing his own band. Shortly thereafter, he and his grandparents joined his mother in the Los Angeles area, where he attended La Puente and Garfield high schools.\n\nCarson's adult career began in 1932, when he was only seventeen and still performing as Hubert Flatt. After a short stint on other local radio programs, he spent nine months as a thrice-weekly performer on Stuart Hamblen's popular \"Family Album\" radio program, appearing with such early stars as Patsy Montana. He spent the next several years with popular groups in Los Angeles and Chicago. Ken, then billed as Shorty Carson, and two others formed a group called The Ranch Boys, which played on shows like Don McNeill's Breakfast Club and Garry Moore's \"Club Matinee\", and which made several recordings for Decca Records. In 1934 they appeared in the Clark Gable film \"It Happened One Night\", and in 1935 they were regulars on the Tom Mix radio program, also singing the commercial jingle for Shredded Ralston. In 1938, Carson and The Ranch Boys did a promotion for one of their sponsors, riding 3,975 miles on horseback from Los Angeles to Chicago to New York.\n\nThe Ranch Boys split up in 1941, and Carson, now known as Hugh Carson, hosted a late-night radio program on Chicago's WGN. In 1943, the Sons of the Pioneers asked him to replace one of their members who had been drafted into the army. He accepted the invitation and moved to California, working nights at a military aircraft assembly plant. He remained with the Sons of the Pioneers for four years, which were the peak years of their long run of popularity.\n\nAfter his departure, he continued as a virtuoso performer. He appeared on the radio in two episodes of The Great Gildersleeve and voiced the animated wise old owl in Disney's 1948 live-and-animated film So Dear to My Heart. He made many singing commercials during these years. In the early 1950s, he was a regular performer on The Garry Moore Show, one of the most popular TV shows of the day.\n\nAlways the consummate musician, Ken Carson mastered at least six instruments, and could write and score music of all sorts. He wrote down many of the songs that Bob Nolan sang, adding harmony and composition to Nolan's \"play by ear\" vocals. Carson was a skillful whistler, showing that talent on many recordings of Western songs, notably the Pioneers' \"Blue Shadows on the Trail\". He was an accomplished songwriter who also co-wrote many songs with his friends. The Sons of the Pioneers maintained that he was a better singer than Frank Sinatra. His voice was \"clear as a bell', which made it difficult for him to blend in with the close harmonies often required with his group.\n\nThough he didn't speak Spanish, Carson had a perfect Spanish accent, which he is said to have picked up in high school. He was an excellent horseman, having competed in rodeos as a young man. He was an excellent golfer from his teens onward; at age 22 he won the NBC golf tournament. When he became so good as a natural left-hander, he learned to play golf right-handed. Carson sang at the wedding of Tricia Nixon Cox, which he said was the highlight of his career. In 1979, he and his wife retired to Delray Beach, Florida. He continued to entertain locally, performing a wide repertoire that included songs of George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Billy Joel, and Stevie Wonder, as well as Western music.\n\n"}

{"id": "1463308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1463308", "title": "Ostern", "text": "Ostern\n\nThe Ostern (Eastern) or Red Western (also known as \"Borscht Western\") was a genre film created in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc as a version of the Western films that originated in the United States. The term refers to two related genres:\n\n\nWhile obviously influenced by Westerns, Easterns form a specific and distinct genre. The word \"Ostern\" is derived from the German word \"Ost\", meaning \"East\".\n\nRed Westerns of the first type are often compared to Spaghetti Westerns, in that they use local scenery to imitate the American West. In particular, Yugoslavia, Mongolia and the Southern USSR were used. Some of the East German films were called Sauerkraut Westerns.\n\nEasterns provide a counterpoint to familiar mythologies and conventions of the original genre, particularly as the makers were on the other side of a propaganda war without parallel, the Cold War, and this is partially why many have never been shown in the west, at least not until after the Cold War ended. In a war in which many fabrications were made on both sides, there was often a lingering fascination with the cultural developments in enemy countries.\n\nWesterns have proven particularly transferable in the way that they create a mythology out of relatively recent history, a malleable idea that translates well to different cultures. In Soviet Union, the Ostern uses the generic calling cards of the American Western to dramatise the Civil War in Central Asia in the 1920s and 1930s, in which the Red Army fought against Islamic Turkic 'Basmachi' rebels. By substituting, 'red' for 'blue' and 'Turk' for Mexican or Indian, there are the same opportunities for a sweeping drama played out against a backdrop of wide-open spaces. The Ural Mountains can be equivalent to Monument Valley, the Volga River for the Rio Grande. Add the gun slinging ethos, horse riding, working the land, pioneers of a sort (ideological often in this case), the bounty hunter traversing difficult terrain with outlaw in tow, railroading and taming the wild frontier and you have a generic mirror image of the American genre.\nOne story could have many incarnations: the British Lost Patrol (1929) was set in Mesopotamia but was remade among others as the 1936 Soviet film \"The Thirteen\", featuring Basmachi antagonists, and as the 1953 American Western \"Last of the Comanches\".\n\nRed Westerns which use the actual American west as a setting include, the Romanian \"The Oil, the Baby and the Transylvanians\" (1981) which dramatises the struggles of Romanian and Hungarian settlers in a new land. The Czech \"Lemonade Joe\" and the Soviet \"A Man from the Boulevard des Capucines\" plump for pastiche or satire, making fun of the hard worn conventions of the American films. The German \"The Sons of the Great Bear\" (1966) turned the traditional American \"Cowboy and Indian\" conventions on their head, casting the Native Americans as the \"heroes\" and the American Army as the villains - this was well within the established tradition of Karl May's highly successful German Western novels, but had some obvious Cold War overtones. The film started a series of \"Indian films\" by the East German DEFA studios which were quite successful.\n\nMany of the non-Soviet examples of the genre were international co-productions akin to the Spaghetti Westerns. \"The Sons of the Great Bear\" for example was a co-production between East Germany and Czechoslovakia, starring a Yugoslav, scripted in German, and shot in a number of different Eastern Bloc countries and used a variety of locations including Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Mongolia and Czechoslovakia. \"The Oil, the Baby and the Transylvanians\" was a Romanian film, but featured emigrant Hungarians heavily in the storyline.\n\nThere is some divergence between the true Red Western and the true Eastern in their portrayal of certain subject matter.\n\nProper Red Westerns share some features in common with the general Revisionist Western, notably, a more sympathetic portrayal of working people, Native Americans, and Mexicans. In the true Red Western more focus was put on the lawlessness of the time period, favoring realism over romanticism.\n\nWith the true \"Ostern\" (\"Eastern\"), some of these tendencies may be reversed, particularly in reference to Soviet history and particularly in the context of the Russian Civil War and Basmachi rebellion. Sympathy for the working class is obviously paramount, but it is also common to romanticise and stereotype non-Russian characters. Thus, Osterns often cast Russian or Jewish actors in prominent \"ethnic\" parts. Spartak Mishulin, who plays Sayid in \"White Sun of the Desert\", and Konstantin Raikin, who plays Kayum in \"At Home among Strangers\", are just some examples of this (compare Eli Wallach in \"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly\"). \"At Home among Strangers\", for example, whilst critically acclaimed, has a very one-sided view of its period, which was partly due to political pressure.\n\nWhat they both share with the revisionist Western, includes a disdain for the business class (cf \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" and its critique of the rail builders), organised religion and Christianity and the idea of the \"American Dream\" and its related ethic.\n\nThere is also some common ground with the Zapata Western genre, which is often related to the Mexican Revolution, notably \"A Fistful of Dynamite\" which is a serious, non-romanticized look at revolution.\n\nIn \"Dauria\" (1971), Siberian Cossacks are acting like American cowboys: horseriding, fighting, shooting, and even robbing a bank.\n\nA number of films from the former Eastern bloc, while not falling neatly into the genre, are partly influenced by it. \"Siberiade\" by Andrei Konchalovsky, the isolated Siberian frontier town, which becomes irrevocably changed thanks to the discovery of oil, bears a resemblance to Western family epics.\n\n\"Gibanica western\" was a short-lived term for the Yugoslav equivalent of the Ostern, more commonly known as partisan film and, sometimes, the Partisan western. They were made in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and were about the partisans in World War II. At that point, Yugoslavia had broken away from the Soviets.\n\nThe Goulash westerns are the Easterns of Hungarian director György Szomjas. He directed two films (\"The Wind Blows Under Your Feet\" and \"Wrong-Doers\") in the 1970s.\n\n"}
{"id": "3469437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3469437", "title": "Pet insurance", "text": "Pet insurance\n\nPet insurance pays, partly or in total, for veterinary treatment of the insured person's ill or injured pet. Some policies will pay out when the pet dies, or if the pet is lost or stolen.\n\nAs veterinary medicine is increasingly employing expensive medical techniques and drugs, and owners have higher expectations for their pets' health care and standard of living than previously, the market for pet insurance has increased.\n\nThe first pet insurance policy was written in 1890 by Claes Virgin. Virgin was the founder of Länsförsäkrings Alliance, at that time he focused on horses and livestock. In 1947 the first pet insurance policy was sold in Britain. As of 2009, Britain had the second-highest level of pet insurance in the world (23%), behind only Sweden. According to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Clinical Veterinary Science and the Pet Food Institute, only 0.7% of pets in the United States are covered by Pet Insurance. In 1982, the first pet insurance policy was sold in the United States, and issued to television's Lassie by Veterinary Pet Insurance (VPI).\n\nMany pet owners believe pet insurance is a variation of human health insurance; however, pet insurance is actually a form of property insurance. As such, pet insurance reimburses the owner after the pet has received care and the owner submits a claim to the insurance company. Pet insurance policies primarily cover dogs, cats and horses though more exotic species of animal can obtain coverage. \n\nUK policies may pay 100% of vets fees, but this is not always the case. It is common for UK pet insurance companies to discount their policies by offering customers the chance to pay an \"excess\", just as with motor insurance. Excess fees can range from £40 to £100. \n\nPolicies in the United States and Canada either pay off a benefit schedule or pay a percentage of the vet costs (70-100%), after reaching a deductible, depending on the company and the policy. The owner usually pays the amount due to the veterinarian and then sends in the claim form and receives reimbursement, which some companies and policies limit according to their own schedules of necessary and usual charges. For very high bills, some veterinarians allow the owner to put off payment until the insurance claim is processed. Some insurers pay veterinarians directly on behalf of customers. Most American and Canadian policies require the pet owner to submit a request for fees incurred.\n\nPreviously, most pet insurance plans did not pay for preventative care (such as vaccinations) or elective procedures (such as neutering). Recently, however, some companies in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States are offering routine-care coverage, sometimes called comprehensive coverage. Dental care, prescription drugs and alternative treatments, such as physiotherapy and acupuncture, are also covered by some providers.\n\nThere are two categories of insurance policies for pets: non-lifetime and lifetime. The first covers buyers for most conditions suffered by their pet during the course of a policy year but, on renewal in a following year, a condition that has been claimed for will be excluded. If that condition needs further treatment the pet owner will have to pay for that him/herself. The second category covers a pet for ongoing conditions throughout the pet’s lifetime so that, if a condition is claimed for in the first year, it will not be excluded in subsequent years. However, lifetime policies also have limits: some have limits \"per condition\", others have limits \"per condition, per year\", and others have limits \"per year\", all of which have different implications for a pet owner whose pet needs treatment year after year, so it is wise to be clear which type of lifetime policy you are considering.\n\nIn addition, companies often limit coverage for pre-existing conditions in order to eliminate fraudulent consumers, thus giving owners an incentive to insure even very young animals, who are not expected to incur high veterinary costs while they are still healthy. There is usually a short period after a pet insurance policy is bought when the holder will be unable to claim for sickness, often no more than 14 days from inception. This is to cover illnesses contracted before the pet was covered but whose symptoms appeared only after coverage has begun.\n\nSome insurers offer options not directly related to pet health, including covering boarding costs for animals whose owners are hospitalized, or costs (such as rewards or posters) associated with retrieving lost animals. Some policies also include travel cancellation coverage if owners must remain with pets who need urgent treatment or are dying.\n\nSome British policies for dogs also include third-party liability insurance. Thus, for example, if a dog causes a car accident that damages a vehicle, the insurer will pay to rectify the damage for which the owner is responsible under the Animals Act 1971.\n\nPet insurance companies are beginning to offer the pet owner more of an ability to customize their coverage by allowing them to choose their own level of deductible or co-insurance. This allows the pet owner to control their monthly premium and choose the level of coverage that suits them the best.\n\nSome of the differences in insurance coverage are:\n\n"}

Official figures state there are around 2,000 prostitutes in the country, who are not allowed to operate near schools, hospitals, and churches. According to the 2009 Human Rights Reports, security forces occasionally follow women engaged in prostitution and arrest those who had spent the night with a foreigner. Some women enter prostitution due to poverty.\n\nProstitutes are known locally as \"shermuta\" in Arabic, or \"mnzerma\" and \"me'amn\" in Tigrinya.\n\nThere had been courtesans and concubines in the Habesha culture for centuries.\n\nAfter the colonisation by Italy in the 1880s, prostitution flourished to take care of the sexual needs of the Italian troops and colonialists in the country. Prostitution was encouraged by the authorities to discourage mixed marriages between Italians and locals. Brothels were opened and local women were recruited, by coercion if necessary, to work in them. These brothels were subsidised by the authorities. There was a surge in the 1930s with the build up of troops prior to the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Women from the rural areas migrated to the towns and cities to service the needs of the single Italian men. In the major towns such as Assab, Asmara and Massawa, prostitution was common in the bars of the \"native quarters\". This situation continued through the WW2, including after the Italians were displaced by the British.\n\nFollowing the federation with Ethiopia in 1950, the Ethiopian troops stationed in Eritrea, and the American troops at Kagnew Station continued the demand for prostitution. Prostitution increased during the 1970s with the build-up of the Ethiopian garrisons in the area. In the 1980s there were many prostitutes in Assab, Asmara and Massawa, many of them Tigrayans. Many worked in bars owned by successful prostitutes.\n\nDuring the Eritrean War of Independence, Eritrean girls in occupied territories we required to sign up to join the army at 16. There is evidence many were used as prostitutes by the soldiers. At time of liberation by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front and independence, there were 4,000 prostitutes in the country, and 2,000 Ethiopian women were deported in an attempt to curtail prostitution. With the spread of HIV in the 1990s, prostitution was regulated and sex workers were required to have a monthly health check.\n\nProstitution increased in Asmara following arrival of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea peacekeeping force in 2000.\n\n\nHIV is a problem in the country, although it has one of the lowest prevalence rates in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the 1990s prostitution was regulated and monthly health checks carried out to try and stop the spread of infections. 25 clinics and hospitals gave free testing for prostitutes. Social workers used community elders to try and spread the message of safe sex and condom use to prostitutes and clients.\n\nCampaigns have targeted high risk groups, including sex workers. As a result, the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers has fallen from 22% in 2002, to 10.4% in 2014. Condom use by sex workers had risen to 95% in 2014.\n\nChild prostitution is a problem in the country. The law criminalises child prostitution. The minimum age for consensual sex is 18. Penalties for conviction of the commercial sexual exploitation of children include imprisonment. Crimes were seldom reported, and punishment rarely applied. Data on the extent of child prostitution is not available.\n\nUN peacekeeping forces have been involved in the use of under-age prostitutes, some as young as 10. Danish, Italian, Slovakian and Irish soldiers have been implicated.\n\nEritrean adults and children are subjected to sex trafficking abroad, primarily in Sudan, Ethiopia, and Libya. Some women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Some Eritrean women and girls travel to Gulf States for domestic work but are subsequently subjected to sex trafficking. Smaller numbers of Eritrean women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in South Sudan, Sudan, and Israel; reportedly, some Eritrean men are vulnerable to sex trafficking in Israel. Some Eritrean military and police officers are complicit in trafficking crimes along the border with Sudan.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Eritrea as a Tier 3 country.\n\n"}

{"id": "700605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=700605", "title": "Rainbow Brite", "text": "Rainbow Brite\n\nRainbow Brite, also known in Japan as , is a media franchise by Hallmark Cards, introduced in 1983. The animated television series of the same name first aired in 1984, the same year Hallmark licensed Rainbow Brite to Mattel for a range of dolls and other merchandise. A theatrical feature-length film, \"Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer\", was released by Warner Bros. in 1985. The franchise was rebooted in 1996, 2003, 2009, and then again in 2014 through Hallmark's online on-demand streaming video service, Feeln. A line of new merchandise sold only by Hallmark online and in its shops debuted in 2015.\n\nCreation and development of Rainbow Brite for Hallmark Cards is credited to both Hallmark's Vice President of\nCreative/Licensing, Garry Glissmeyer, a team of artists headed by Cheryl Cozad, and writers under the direction of Hallmark's Editorial Director, Dan Drake. Hallmark's Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Lanny Julian, assembled a team of legal, marketing, and public relations associates for this new licensing division.\n\nGlissmeyer and Julian were tasked with breaking Hallmark into the licensing business with the creation of characters targeted at children. Glissmeyer's group's concept of a young girl with powers over nature evolved into her being responsible for all of the colors of the universe. Once the concept was agreed to, Cozad's and Drake's teams developed the backstory and characters needed to support it. Jim McDowell, a key player from Hallmark's marketing unit, conceptualized a strategy to get the new brand in the public eye.\n\nJulian chose Mattel as the manufacturer and distributor for the line of dolls and toys to follow. Julian chose DIC Entertainment of France as the studio to provide the brand with episodic animation for television. Glissmeyer placed Cozad in charge of the in-house creative group, to work with Mattel and other licensees. Glissmeyer and Drake continued with creative input, working with DIC on the animation development.\n\nWhile Hallmark artist, G.G. Santiago, developed the final \"look\" of Rainbow Brite, Cozad's team finalized style guide models for Rainbow Brite and her friends. Hallmark writer, Mary Loberg, and freelance television writer, Woody Kling, worked with DIC in creating TV storylines for the series, which provided DIC the framework to produce the animation episodes. Kling only worked on three episodes and did not create the Rainbow Brite character or brand as some people believe.\n\nRainbow Brite made her animated debut in the syndicated prime-time television special, \"Peril in the Pits,\" which was first aired on June 27, 1984. Later, a pair of two-part specials were produced: \"The Mighty Monstromurk Menace\" and \"The Beginning of Rainbowland.\" A theatrical feature-length film, \"Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer\", was released by Warner Bros. in 1985. These were followed up with eight more episodes for a total of thirteen, which is one season in American television. The episodes became part of DIC's weekly syndicated \"Kideo TV\" block of programming and were rerun in 1987. All were published on VHS videotapes in the United States and other countries, along with two live-action programs. One of these was a program intended for use at kids' birthday parties; the other was made on location at the world-famous San Diego Zoo.\n\nHallmark also created a Rainbow Brite Style Book for companies that wanted to make Rainbow Brite items under license. It gave detailed drawings of all the players and Hallmark's policies on a number of subjects such as the use of its Rainbow Brite logos on the packaging for each product, copyright notices on all products where feasible, fees for creating artwork and the approvals needed before production of new Rainbow Brite merchandise could start.\n\nIn Gen 1 continuity, and most of the franchise's backstory, a young girl named Wisp is brought to a gray, desolate land with the mission to bring color to this fictional world by locating the Sphere of Light. Along the way, she befriends a furry creature (called a sprite) named Twink and a magnificent horse named Starlite and finds a mysterious baby who turns out to be the key to her mission. With the help of her new friends, Wisp locates the legendary Color Belt and rescues the seven Color Kids, who had been trapped by the King of Shadows. Using the Color Belt, Wisp and the Sphere of Light defeat the King of Shadows, liberate the sprites, and bring color and beauty to the land, henceforth called Rainbow Land. Wisp is renamed Rainbow Brite in honor of her new role as leader of the Color Kids, who are together in charge of all the colors in the universe.\n\nThe Color Kids spread color across the universe from the Color Console inside the Color Castle. Each Color Kid is in charge of their respective color, has a personal sprite and manages a number of like-colored sprites that mine Color Crystals from the nearby Color Caves. These crystals are processed into Star Sprinkles which are the essential components to brightening and coloring any object or place. Rainbow Brite and the Color Kids' mission is often complicated by the likes of Murky Dismal, his sidekick Lurky, and other villains. Brian, a boy from Earth, sometimes assisted Rainbow Brite in her adventures.\n\nIn the movie, \"Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer\", the setting expands to include the diamond planet, Spectra. All the light in the universe must pass through Spectra before coming to Earth. However, Earth soon falls into a wintry darkness when the diamond-obsessed Dark Princess decides to steal Spectra for her own. Rainbow Brite and her horse, Starlite, must team with Spectra's boy warrior, Krys, and his robotic horse, On-X, to defeat the powers of darkness and save Spectra, Earth, and the universe.\n\nGen 2 continuity took a radical departure from any other generation's story, focusing as much on ethnic diversity as the colors of the rainbow. Rainbow Brite had an entirely new and smaller group of friends called the Color Crew. Despite distribution and marketing in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, the toy line never reached the success of its predecessor and ended after little more than a year.\n\nGen 3 was basically a relaunch of Gen 1 in 2003, with the same story, but a smaller range of characters produced. The dolls from Toy Play were similar to but not exact copies of the Gen 1 versions. There was also a sizable amount of Rainbow Brite merchandise from various other manufacturers just as in Gen 1.\n\nGen 4A celebrated the 25th Anniversary of Rainbow Brite in 2009 with continuity returning the setting again to Rainbow Land, which looked nothing like the original version. This time, Rainbow Brite and her friends' mission was to bring hope and happiness to the far corners of the universe, making hearts lighter and worlds a little more colorful along the way. The story focuses on Rainbow Brite, Tickled Pink, and Moonglow, each representing one of Rainbow Land's Sky Powers, which determine the cycles of the days and seasons. Gen 4 continuity makes Rainbow Brite a girl originally from Earth (Return to Rainbow Land). Rainbow Brite's absence from the world is explained in a story that sees Rainbow return to her home on Earth for a brief visit with her family after many adventures spreading color throughout Rainbow Land and the universe. But when the Dark Princess erases Rainbow Land from Rainbow Brite's memory while on Earth, she never returns to her duties in Rainbow Land. Rainbow Brite eventually returns to Rainbow Land with the help of Starlite and Puppy Brite. Playmates' line of toys was very controversial among fans and consumers largely because of the change in Rainbow Brite's age from about 6 or 7 years old, to 10 or 11. These dolls had a more mature fashion doll-like design, which was totally unlike all of the previous dolls in the series. The three girl dolls were wearing training bras and panties under their clothes. The line suffered a delay, which caused the toys to not be available until after the holiday season that year. It saw scarce distribution as retailers were not impressed with it and was canceled after just seven months and before the first release was completed.\n\nFeeln's (part of Hallmark) Gen 4B animated reboot retained most Gen 1 story elements and recognizable but not identical character designs. It introduced a few new story elements, one being the Sentinels of Light, which included Rainbow Brite as a guardian of light and color and Krys as the protector of light unseen. Stormy also played a more prominent role. After a falling out with her pal, Rainbow Brite, Stormy joined the forces of darkness and became a formidable frenemy. As the Dark Princess's manipulations became more transparent, Stormy started questioning where her true loyalties lay and returned to Rainbow Land as Rainbow Brite's friend. Gen 4B consisted solely of web content from Hallmark and only resulted in a minuscule amount of give-away merchandise. None of the items were available for purchase.\n\nGen 5 began in 2015 with dolls and toys very similar to those of Gens 1 and 3. Hallmark worked on the design, storylines, distribution and sales which have, so far, been limited to Hallmark shops in the United States and Canada, and the Hallmark website. The line began with a limited production of Hallmark's Itty Bittys plush miniatures before expanding to larger Twink & Starlite plushes, a 16\" Rainbow Brite doll, a series of hard cover story books, women's clothing, and an expansion of the Itty Bittys line. More Rainbow Brite merchandise was introduced in 2016 and even more is expected in 2017. In the fall of 2016, Hallmark finally gave Rainbow Brite fans what they had been waiting for since the 1980s; a Stormy doll with her own horse. New books were released at the same time but the Gen 5 line is still small when compared to Gen 1.\n\nFor the first Rainbow Brite generation (1984–1987), Mattel produced the dolls and many of the toys along with a large line of school supplies only sold in Italy. Other Rainbow Brite licensed merchandise was produced by various companies. This included many story and activity books by Western Publishing (Little Golden Books), a number of puzzles, a line of costume jewelry, banks and suitcases by Kat's Meow, clothes, toys, games, doll and child furniture, radios, child cosmetics, linen, towels, personal care items, lamps, figurines, VHS videocassettes, audio cassettes, records, bicycles, bedding, curtains and much more sold in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The rest of Europe saw a smaller variety of merchandise, though this varied from country to country.\n\nFor example, the entire Mattel line was not sold in all countries. Italy and Spain did not receive the second release of dolls (Lala Orange, Buddy Blue & Shy Violet), the Dress Up line or Kitty Brite. Many Mattel items were made in Europe by local suppliers for the local markets. A French toymaker produced Rainbow Brite, Murky Dismal and Lurky in Mattel packaging in France during 1984 and 1985. An Italian toy company made the European versions of Starlite, the Color Cottage, and the Color Buggy for all of Europe during 1984 and 1985. In both cases, production was switched to Mattel's contract manufacturers in Asia for 1986 and 1987. The entire line of Rainbow Brite for Spain (six dolls, five sprites, Starlite, Lurky and the Color Cottage) was produced in Spain from 1984 until the line ended there in 1986 or 1987. Similarly, this occurred in Mexico with the entire doll line minus the Dress Up dolls. This was the result of high import duties in a number of countries at the time, caused by protectionist policies.\n\nBooks, comic books, sticker albums and audio tapes were the best selling licensed items outside the United Kingdom, but other items did exist in different countries. In Germany alone there were no less than thirty-one story cassettes and forty-six comic books. Germany also had an exclusive version of the Dress Up Rainbow Brite doll that included a story cassette. This cassette was not sold separately but was produced by Europa, producer of the other 30 story cassettes. It is unknown if the cassettes were sent to the Asian factory that made the dolls or were put into the dolls' boxes in Germany. A line of five 3D erasers in the form of various Rainbow Brite characters was sold in Europe with Mattel branding, while the same line was also sold in Australia under the name of Harveston Super Action figures with the addition of an additional character (Lurky) not sold in Europe. A number of Gen 1B (the second release of the first generation) dolls made for the American and Mexican markets ended up being sold in Germany because of strong demand there. These dolls had their English or Spanish names covered by a sticker with the German name or sometimes nothing at all. Two Rainbow Brite dolls plus Twink and Starlite were also produced in Brazil by Estrella. These were not exported anywhere and came in their own unique white packaging with all writing less the Rainbow Brite name in the Brazilian version of Portuguese. Because of Rainbow Brite's extreme popularity soon after she was launched, a number of other companies not related to Mattel produced many unlicensed lookalike (fake or bootleg) items that were sold in North America and Europe.\n\nThe Mattel line of toys and dolls was quite large. There were three large dolls, five medium dolls (Emotions) 12 small dolls, nine animals, 50 sprites (including those that came with the small dolls), four large boxed toys, ten boxed wallhangings and doll carriers, and 27 small carded toys for a total of 111 different items and this does not include generational (some dolls were sold in two different boxes over time in some markets) and international packaging variations. These toys were expensive for their time and Mattel responded by producing a lower priced line of toys sold loose with tags called the 'Emotions' line. The Emotions line included five dolls including a 15\" Buddy Blue doll, that was sold only in Canada. The extra sprite in the line happened to be Champ. Also included were five Sprites, Starlite the horse and Lurky. Oddly enough, the Emotions dolls were larger than the small dolls in the regular line, but the Emotions horse was smaller than the normal version. As such the Emotions dolls were neither in scale with the Emotions horse or the regular Mattel version. And of course the Emotions dolls were too big to sit on the Emotions horse or the normal one. Not all toys were sold in all markets, and the Emotions line was never sold outside the United States and Canada.\n\nMattel's Dress Up line of dolls and horses is the most sought after part of the entire Mattel line, particularly Moonglow who was only sold in Germany. Although Stormy's doll was shown in the Mattel catalog and on the backs of the Dress Up doll boxes, she was never produced for retail even though the character did appear in some cartoon episodes and several German comic books. There was also a line of cataloged clothing for the Dress Up dolls, but like Stormy, it was never produced. The two horses, Starlight and Sunriser, were made from hard plastic rather than being stuffed. They were in fact from Mattel's line of 'Barbie' merchandise. The Dress Up line was only made for about one year. That makes the two horses and Moonglow very difficult to find today, especially MIB. The Tickled Pink and Rainbow Brite Dress Up dolls are somewhat difficult to find these days compared to the rest of the Gen 1 line.\n\nTelevised commercials for Mattel's Rainbow Brite dolls frequently featured the song, \"Over the Rainbow,\" from The Wizard of Oz, often with altered lyrics or arrangements. Child actors Tracey Gold, Kellie Martin and Heather O'Rourke, famous for their roles in 1980s television and film, also appeared.\n\nThe second Rainbow Brite generation (1996–1997) greatly differed from any generation before or since. It used the Rainbow Brite name but not the same characters or backstory. The master license was held by Up, Up and Away, a company which is no longer in business.\n\nRainbow Brite no longer had anything do with making colors and was now in charge of diversity. Although this version did have rainbow-colored hair, the characters resembled real-world children more than their previous animated and doll counterparts. In the second generation's story, Rainbow Brite had four friends, called the Color Crew, which included Amber (Latina), Cerise (Asian), Ebony (African) and Indigo (Central Asian, the only character name borrowed from the original Color Kids).\n\nRainbow Brite was produced as large and small dolls while the Color Crew was represented only in the small doll range. The large Rainbow Brite dolls came with three pots of Color-Glo Paint and a brush, while the small dolls included a single pot of Color-Glo Paint and a brush. The large doll was released in two different boxes, the first lacking a window so buyers could not see the doll inside. As the doll was sold with three different wardrobes, buying one was a gamble regarding which look she would have (unless one read the small code box on the bottom of the package indicating the doll's shoe color). The large doll later came in a window box with a simplified single wardrobe. The small dolls came boxed at first and then blister carded on two different types of cards. They are noted for being the only Rainbow Brite dolls ever produced with Dutch text on the packaging.\n\nThe Canadian importer was Irvine, a company which is currently still in business, and their product packaging was printed in both French and English texts. Ideal Toy Company was the importer for most of Western Europe, though Euro Play imported the line for Germany. The large doll was also distributed in Italy by GiG with only Italian text on the box. There were no other toys or accessories for the second generation dolls other than additional pots of Color-Glo Paint, which were sold in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. There was also a version of at least the large doll in a box with Spanish-only text. Another 15\" Rainbow Brite doll with a Color Glo Bear and paint set was prototyped, as was a black version, which was produced in very small numbers. But only the black version was ever produced and then in very limited numbers. There was a Gen 2B which had simplified packaging and outfits as an effort to keep the line going by cutting costs. The second generation had nowhere near the success the first generation had at retail and was discontinued after less than two years on the market. \nThe third Rainbow Brite generation (2003–2005) was also the 20th Anniversary Release. The master toy licensee was Toy Play, a defunct subsidiary of The Betesh Group. The parent company is still in business. Nick Jr. was the television network that advertised the line. Hot Topic was the lead merchandiser with a unique Rainbow Brite doll not manufactured by Toy Play and many items of women's clothing, accessories and stationary.\n\nWithout being an exact copy of the originals, this generation returned to the look and feel of the Mattel line even if the product line was much narrower than the first generation. Toy Play followed the first generation's character roll out, producing Rainbow Brite, Red Butler, Canary Yellow and Patty O'Green characters but no more Color Kids followed. Starlite, Puppy Brite and the Sprites were also represented in various merchandise.\n\nCharacters were produced in different sizes, from three to twenty-eight inches tall across the line which went from PVC plastic figurines to plush dolls. Toy Play produced both retro-style plush dolls with wiring in their limbs to make them poseable along with plastic dolls wearing soft clothing and having articulated arms and legs. Some dolls were sold with a Region 1 DVD in English featuring a single episode of the original cartoon. Some Toy Play products were sold in Canada with English-French packaging. Toy Play's 18 inch talking Rainbow Brite doll notoriously omitted the color green when 'speaking' all of the colors of the rainbow. Toy Play indicated that the missing color would be added for future production runs, but this never happened because the line died out before a corrected version appeared.\n\nToy Play was the first (and so far only) merchandiser to produce a Color Castle playset, the Light Up Musical Castle, which included small articulated figurines of Rainbow Brite, Red Butler, Twink and Puppy Brite. The playset's box showed pictures of forthcoming product (a Rainbow Brite and Friends Sprites' village playset, an in-scale Starlite with brushable mane, as well as figurine 2-packs to include Rainbow Brite and Twink, Red Butler and Romeo, Patty O'Green and Lucky, Canary Yellow and Spark, and Murky Dismal and Lurky) though these were never produced. There was also a wide range of other merchandise, mostly clothing, that was available during Gen 3. For some unknown reason, the orange-colored tags and logos that started with Gen 3 have been revived for Gen 5. \n\nThe fourth Rainbow Brite generation (2009–2010) was the 25th anniversary release and was accompanied by a series of web-episodes produced by Animax Entertainment that were available to stream on www.RainbowBrite.com., which no longer exists. The master toy license belonged to Playmates Toys and their line of Rainbow Brite toys was expected to be in stores in the fall of 2009. Production delays saw the line actually debut in stores on December 24 of that year, which of course missed the 2009 holiday shopping season.\n\nThis interpretation of Rainbow Brite was controversial among fans of the original Rainbow Brite as the characters, though still youthful in appearance, appeared significantly older and were styled more like traditional 11\" fashion dolls. The line's initial product release only included three plastic fashion dolls (Rainbow Brite, Tickled Pink, and Moonglow) and three plastic horses with rooted manes (Starlite, Sunriser, and Shimmer). A larger 15\" Rainbow Brite doll was also produced. The line initially omitted the Color Kids altogether in favor of a more sky-power oriented storyline. The packaging art hinted at a possible Stormy doll to come, though yet again she never arrived.\n\nThe Playmates' line never caught on with its target audience. After missing its holiday season window and facing controversy within the fandom, the Playmates' Rainbow Brite line withered on the vine and died. Most retailers refused to carry the line and those that did saw stock run out by July 2010. If any reorders were placed, they were not in quantities that justified continued production. The line was only on the market for about seven months and was not available in all of the Contiguous United States.\n\nIn the Fall of 2010 three Sprite dolls appeared at retail in Mexico. These included Twinkle (a renamed Twink) for Rainbow Brite, Nite Sprite for Moonglow and Twilite for Tickled Pink. These were already in production when US retailers dropped the line. The fourth generation saw a number of licensed products similar to the third generation, some in the original Gen 1 style and some in the new Gen 4 style. This included mostly clothing and stationary, plus a small bicycle. The final products during the fourth generation came from Madame Alexander, and included a traditional Madame Alexander-style Gen 1 Rainbow Brite doll with Twink, as well as Gen 4-style plush dolls of Rainbow Brite and Tickled Pink. \nA three-part animated miniseries was launched on November 6, 2014 by Video On Demand site Feeln. The reboot showcased updated character designs for the cast, and starred Emily Osment as the voice of Rainbow Brite and Molly Ringwald as the voice of Dark Princess. The second episode was shown on November 13, 2014 and the series concluded on November 20, 2014. Feeln's miniseries was well received by many in the Rainbow Brite fandom but it did not produce any merchandise. As such, it has not been given a generation number but is sometimes called Gen 4A because it arrived before the Gen 4 dolls and horses arrived in the shops near the end of the following month and is sometimes called Gen 4B. Although a Starlite Pillow Pal was produced by Pillow Pets during this time, it was actually not part of the Playmates line of toys.\n\nHallmark introduced the fifth generation of Rainbow Brite toys, along with clothing and other merchandise in July 2015. A limited edition line of Rainbow Brite Itty Bittys featuring Rainbow Brite, Twink, Champ, O.J., Lucky and I.Q. arrived first, each produced in limited quantities of 500 units. These sold out in five days on hallmark.com, and the demand led to Hallmark reissuing the Itty Bittys with slightly revised designs in much greater numbers along with the first Rainbow Brite Itty Bittys boxed set featuring Red Butler, Romeo, Indigo and Hammy. These items were followed by an 8\" Twink plush and 11\" Starlite plush in September 2015, as well as a 16\" Rainbow Brite doll that November.\n\nIn 2016 Hallmark released another Itty Bitty boxed set featuring Patty O'Green, Buddy Blue, Lucky & Champ. A 24\" Rainbow Brite Jumbo Itty Bitty arrived in December. A limited edition Shy Violet Itty Bitty was released as a Hallmark online exclusive that Summer. In Fall of 2016 many new Rainbow Brite items were available at Hallmark stores and online, including several new story and activity books, a new range of greeting cards, and a 1,000 piece Rainbow Land puzzle. A Starlite Itty Bitty was released in November, as well as 11\" Sunriser and Skydancer plushes, and for the first time ever a 16\" Stormy doll. Packaging for the single items consists only of attached tags with the product name, Hallmark logo, copyright notice and barcode, while the boxed sets feature Rainbow Land displayable backgrounds. These toys are currently sold only in the United States and Canada. Additionally, Hallmark Keepsake Rainbow Brite holiday ornaments were sold in 2015 (a reissue of Hallmark's 2013 ornament) and 2016.\nRainbow Brite had a number of names in other languages even if the Rainbow Brite name was on all of the packaging for all markets. In Canadian French she was called Azurine, from the azure color of her dress. In European French she was called Blondine au Pays de l'Arc-en-Ciel (The Blonde Girl from the Land of the Rainbow) or just Blondine for short. In German speaking countries and regions, she was called Regina Regenbogen (Regina Rainbow). In Italy she was called Iridella which came from her iridescent dress. In both Spanish and Portuguese speaking markets she was called Arco Iris (also Rainbow). In Spain, she was also called Rubita (a diminutive for Blonde). The other characters in the Rainbow Brite universe also had language-specific names. The French names for everyone in Rainbow Land in Canadian French were different than the names used in European French. In Dutch-speaking areas, the English names were used.\n\n\n"}

Dances are performed at ceremonies and special occasions, as well as on a regular basis in some hotels and restaurants, which feature local musicians performing traditional songs and dance. The National Museum of Solomon Islands at Point Cruz also organises live dances and other cultural displays of its provinces.\n\nDancing is often accompanied by bamboo bands, and panpipes are a popular accompaniment. Women are often topless while performing dance in the Solomon Islands; in some of the western islands, they may wear breechcloth made from blue-dyed tapa cloth as a wrap-around skirt. In Tamate dance, performers wore whole body costumes made of bamboo with a curious mythological appearance.\n\nIn 1974, Polynesian Dances of Bellona (Mungiki), which included \"suahongi\" form and which had been forbidden to be performed during the 1940s by the Christian missionaries, was revived and recorded in Honiara. \"Suahongi\", performed by men, is enacted at the conclusion of the \"manga'e\" ceremony, a ritual of sharing the surplus harvest of fish and garden crops. The dance is performed to songs which are set in the form of \"feature call and response, speech–song\" and highly rhythmic; music notes included the short history of the island of Bellona.\n\nAt Rennel (\"Munggava\") and Bellona (\"Mungiki\"), two islands administered by Solomon Islands, dance and music were banned by the missionaries, but revived during World War II. \"Suahongi\" (meaning a \"circle\", or to \"hover about\"), is an important dance form in the Bellonese tradition. It is a ritual dance which lasts for about half an hour, has three parts, and is performed by men. The first part, called the \"buatanga\", is performed in circles while the other two parts are done in lines.\n\nJane Mink Rossen revived this dance-music form and wrote about it in her book \"Songs of Bellona Island (1987)\". An LP of the same name, refers to it as \"coordinate polyphony\" of two songs rendered simultaneously. Other dances described by Rossen include \"Mako hakapaungo\" (a line dance performed by men with \"fighting clubs and staffs\"); \"Hua patti\", a mixed type of dance; \"Mako hakasaunoni\", which is performed by men folk accompanied by clapping of hands; \"mako nagangi\", another dance form originating from Tikopia is known as ngongole.\n\nIn Tikopia, the most formal festival dances occur during the monsoon season. Dance variations included \"Te mako e ta\" (the dance is beaten), \"mako po\" (clapped dances), \"mako rima\" (arm/hand dances), \"mako rakau\" (dances with wooden implements), and \"mako lasi\" (big dances). It has been said to Firth that, \"The one work of Tikopia is the dance\". He describes the 'dancing impulse' as being so strong in Tikopia that it is \"almost obsessional behaviour\".\n\nThe funeral dance of the Solomon Islands was described by Henry Brougham Guppy in 1887: \n\nThe present rage in dancing style among the youth of the Islands is the \"freestyle dancing\" which has become integral to the night life and entertainment scene. These dance forms, with no resemblance to the traditional dance forms of Solomon Island, are copied from the films 'You Got Served', 'Step Up 1 and ' and 'Stomp the Yard'.\n"}

The film stars Chloë Grace Moretz, Nick Robinson, Ron Livingston, Maggie Siff, Alex Roe, Maria Bello, Maika Monroe, and Liev Schreiber.\n\nDevelopment began in March 2012, when Sony picked up the film rights to the trilogy of novels, with Graham King's production company GK Films and Tobey Maguire's Material Pictures. Filming took place in Atlanta, Georgia from October 2014 to January 2015. \"The 5th Wave\" was released on January 22, 2016, in the United States by Columbia Pictures. It grossed $109 million worldwide against a $54 million budget, and received generally unfavorable reviews from critics.\n\nOhio high-schooler Cassie Sullivan, armed with an M4 carbine, emerges from the woods to raid an abandoned gas station. Upon entering, she hears a male voice calling for help. She finds a wounded man, who points a gun at her, but they each put their weapons down. His other hand is under his jacket and as he takes it out, she sees a glint of metal and kills him. He was holding a Christian cross and the screen cuts to black to show her backstory.\n\nA city-sized alien spaceship is circling Earth, containing extraterrestrials referred to as \"The Others\". Ten days later, The Others unleash their 1st Wave, an electromagnetic pulse that permanently destroys all electrical power. The 2nd Wave has The Others manipulate the planet's geology and fault lines, causing earthquakes and megatsunamis that destroy coastal cities and islands. For the 3rd Wave, The Others weaponize a strain of avian flu virus, with birds carrying the infectant across the planet. Cassie's mother is one of the casualties.\n\nCassie, her father and her younger brother Sam, find a summer camp in use as a refuge in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an Army unit with working vehicles rolls into the camp. The unit's commander, Colonel Vosch, claims there is an imminent threat of a 4th Wave and they will take the children to safety at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, intending to bring the buses back to retrieve the adults. Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the Army massacring all the adults, her father included.\n\nCassie scavenges her way toward the base, but is shot in the leg by an unseen shooter and passes out. About a week later, she wakes up in the farmhouse of a young man named Evan Walker, who saved her. Cassie leaves towards the base with Evan, but learns that he is an Other, sent years ago as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host. The sleepers roam their designated zones, killing human survivors. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw her, disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave. He warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the consciousness of individual Others.\n\nAt the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that the humans outside the base have been possessed. They provide military training to the children, forming them into squads to go on kill missions outside the base. Sam has been placed into a squad led by Ben, a boy Cassie had a crush on, along with Ringer, a tough teenage girl, Dumbo and Teacup. While out on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military implant, causing her to register as an Other-possessed human on the squad's scopes. The squad deduces the plan to have them kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben sends his squad into the woods and returns to base, claiming his squad was killed, for the purpose of retrieving Sam, who was left behind.\n\nBen confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik during her one-on-one indoctrination spiel. Ben and Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam. Evan sets off numerous bombs and advises them to quickly find Sam before the destruction of the entire facility. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military evacuate with the human children by military aircraft. Cassie, Ben and Sam escape, with help from Ringer, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base. Ben's squad is reunited and Cassie ponders the strength of hope as humanity's driving force for survival.\n\nIn March 2012, Columbia Pictures picked up the film rights to the trilogy, with Graham King and Tobey Maguire attached as producers.

The production company promised to cover all damages caused by the 3:45 am incident, but the work that was done was done badly and remains incomplete twenty-eight months later. Filming officially ended on January 17, 2015.\n\nIn April 2015, it was announced that Henry Jackman would compose the music for the film.\n\nColumbia Pictures originally set the film a release date for January 29, 2016.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"With unimpressive effects and plot points seemingly pieced together from previous dystopian YA sci-fi films, \"The 5th Wave\" ends up feeling like more of a limp, derivative wriggle.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 33 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B–\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nJeffrey M. Anderson of \"The San Francisco Examiner\" said of the film, \"Every plot turn and every line of dialogue has been borrowed from somewhere else, and everything is utterly, totally predictable\", noting how the film \"steals material from (but does not stop at) the \"Twilight\", \"Hunger Games\" and \"Divergent\" franchises.\" Anthony Lane of \"The New Yorker\" faulted the film as a \"marketing wheeze dressed up as an art form, and stupendously summarized by the image of Cassie hurrying through the woods carrying both an assault rifle and a Teddy bear\", adding that the film \"appears to have been designed by some crazed Oedipal wing of the N.R.A.\"\n\nRob Vaux of the Sci-Fi Movie Page gave the film one star out of five, saying, \"The YA adaptation craze hits a low point with this aimless, purposeless alien invasion story that wastes a fine cast.\" In the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Mick LaSalle wrote, \"rarely does a movie that fails so utterly start so well\", falling apart ahead of the fifth wave. As to a possible trilogy, \"if we’re not really vigilant, and look to the skies, and prepare, they’re going to make at least two more of these things. We’ve got to beat back the invasion now\". Eddie Cockrell of \"Variety\" gave the film a mixed review, saying, \"\"The 5th Wave\" is an effectively decent post-apocalyptic, young adult, world-in-the-balance survival thriller\" with an \"arrestingly original spin on trendy genre tropes\", although he suggested that fans of the book may have \"issues with what has been edited\".\n\nBrian Truitt of \"USA Today\" gave the film a positive review, stating that it \"is an inviting sci-fi invasion\" and \"nicely stokes the imagination of a new generation of science-fiction movie nerds\". He praised Moretz and Robinson as \"equally strong\" co-leads. Shannon Harvey of \"The West Australian\" also gave the film a positive review, writing, \"It’s actually got a lot going for it, from acting prodigy Chloe Grace Moretz as the kind of tough but fragile heroine you can cheer for to handsome production values, several plot twists\". Michael Patterson of \"Moviepilot\" gave the film a positive review, calling it a \"thrilling story of survival\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "232863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232863", "title": "The Fairly OddParents", "text": "The Fairly OddParents\n\nThe Fairly OddParents is an American animated television series created by Butch Hartman that originally aired on Nickelodeon from March 30, 2001, to July 26, 2017. The series follows the everyday misadventures of Timmy Turner, a boy who is granted two fairy godparents named Cosmo and Wanda. It was produced by Nelvana (2001–2004), Frederator Studios, Nickelodeon Animation Studios and Billionfold Inc. (2008–2017).\n\nThe series originated from shorts on the animation showcase, \"Oh Yeah! Cartoons\", airing from 1998 to 2001. It was later picked up as a series due to its popularity. Originally, it ended in 2006 totaling five seasons, but resumed production in 2008. The series was cancelled after the 10th season.\n\nSet in the fictional town of Dimmsdale, California, a 10-year-old boy named Timmy Turner is neglected by his parents and tortured by his babysitter Vicky. One day, he is granted two fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, who grant his every wish to improve his miserable life. However, these wishes are guaranteed to inadvertently cause a series of technical problems that Timmy must fix. In the beginning of the series, Timmy's babysitter Vicky was the main antagonist. As the series progressed, more villains were included; for example, his teacher, Mr. Crocker, firmly believes in fairy godparents and has been searching for them a very long time, correctly suspecting that Timmy has fairy godparents. He is dangerous to Timmy because, according to \"Da Rules\", a large rulebook that defines what children can and cannot wish for and how fairy godparents must behave, no one else can know about his fairy godparents and they will be taken away if this happens (although they don't remember, Cosmo and Wanda once used to be Crocker's fairy godparents, as this rule does not apply to people who currently have their own or once had fairy godparents).\n\nAt his school, Timmy is often bullied by Francis, a vicious boy who claims to be the toughest student in school, but reveals to Timmy that he only takes out his anger on him because of his rough home life and abusive parents. Jorgen Von Strangle, the enormous and tough head fairy with an Austrian accent, similar to that of Arnold Schwarzenegger, personally dislikes Timmy and his fairies at first, but at times he has to assist them in fixing their problems.\n\nLater in the series, Timmy wished that Cosmo and Wanda would have a baby, whom they named Poof. More recently, Timmy got a pet fairy dog named Sparky. Also introduced is the premise that for every fairy, there is also an anti-fairy. The anti-fairies are similar to the real ones, but with opposite personalities and character traits. For example, Anti-Cosmo is intelligent and speaks with an English accent while real Cosmo is dim-witted. Similarly, Anti-Wanda is also dim-witted and speaks with a Southern American accent while real Wanda is intelligent. When Poof was born, his anti-fairy was created. Anti-Poof's name is Foop (Poof spelled backwards). While Poof is spherical, Foop is shaped like a cube. Foop's goal in life is to cause mayhem and destroy his nemesis Poof.\n\nEven later in the series, Timmy is informed that due to a shortage of available fairies, he must now share Cosmo and Wanda with his new neighbor, Chloe Carmichael, who is essentially his polar opposite. She loves sharing, animals, and everything that is ecologically friendly.\n\n\"The Fairly OddParents\" is set in the fictional city of Dimmsdale, California. The city appears to be average-sized, with a downtown containing large buildings and a city hall but also containing uptown areas with residences (including the house where Timmy and his parents and godparents live) and businesses (including Timmy's school; a hospital; stores; a sports complex named the Dimmadome, named after its founder and owner; the local TV channel; and various restaurants and stores) as well as a park in the center of the city. The city also appears to have rural farmland located somewhere outside of the city. The adults in the city are notably moronic and often settle situations with things like angry mobs, but they do still form a structured and complex society capable of working as a city. In the episode \"Which Witch is Which\", it was revealed that Dimmsdale was founded in the 1630s after Dale Dimm managed to defeat a witch hunter who was secretly a witch named Alden Biterroot (a possible ancestor of Denzel Crocker).\n\nWhen the show needs to, it switches its location to Fairy World, the magical realm and home of the fairies which is a floating world located within the sky and colored with an abundance of pink. The fairies have a civilization like that of the humans, but with a source of power being magic, which also keeps the world afloat. A large rainbow acts as the bridge between Fairy World and the Earth. Another location sometimes seen is the city of Chincinatti, the home town of Timmy's favorite comic book superhero, the Crimson Chin. Other locations include the dark and twisted Anti-Fairy World, the dark counterpart of Fairy World where the anti-fairies live; the dull and gray metropolis of Pixies Inc., home of the pixies; and Yugopotamia, where an alien, Mark Chang, lives, who is also Timmy's friend.\n\n\nThroughout the course of the show, many celebrities have guest starred on \"The Fairly OddParents\", including most notably Adam West and Jay Leno. Some celebrities that voice characters include: Norm Macdonald, Chris Kirkpatrick, Alec Baldwin, Ben Stein, Jackie Mason, Jason Bateman, Rick Fox, Gilbert Gottfried, Michael Clarke Duncan, Brendan Fraser, Patrick Warburton, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Tom Arnold, and Scott Hamilton.\n\n\"The Fairly OddParents\" was originally pitched to Cartoon Network. The pilot was never shown to Cartoon Network, but it was pitched while show creator Butch Hartman was working on Cartoon Network's \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"Johnny Bravo\", \"Cow and Chicken\", and \"I Am Weasel\". The show's pilot was not actually made until the show was pitched to Nick. Creator/Producer Butch Hartman originally created \"The Fairly OddParents\" as a seven-minute short film entitled \"Fairy Godparents\", one of 39 short cartoons in the first season of Fred Seibert's \"Oh Yeah! Cartoons\". Butch Hartman made six more short films for the show in season 3. Nickelodeon agreed to a seven episode order (consisting of two 11-minute segments) of \"The Fairly Oddparents\", which began airing on March 30, 2001, in the half-hour after fellow Nicktoon \"Invader Zim\".\n\nUnlike the half-hour series, the animation in the shorts is not as smooth, and the designs are notably different (including Timmy's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, who are only seen from the neck down with their faces hidden in the pilot episodes and appear to be more intelligent than they appeared to be in the proceeding series, yet still easily duped by Vicky's abhorrent actions). Other notable differences include the voices like Timmy Turner, who was voiced by Mary Kay Bergman instead of Tara Strong. Cosmo is significantly more intelligent than he appears to be in the proceeding series. Wanda is shown to be less intelligent and less of a nag. Vicky is much less evil than in the current series. She also calls Timmy by his name as opposed to the more often used \"twerp\".\n\nOriginally, Hartman wanted Timmy to wear a blue hat, but since it would blend in with the walls of the bedroom, he decided to make it pink. Wanda was originally going to be named \"Venus\", but instead named her Wanda. Her middle name was and still is \"Venus.\"\n\n\"The Fairly OddParents\" was immediately popular, greatly increasing its lead-in rating from \"Invader Zim\". In fact, no matter what time slot Nickelodeon placed the show in, Nick's ratings soared. The series attracted a wider than anticipated audience, appealing to all ages. It was later Nickelodeon's highest rated show. Early 2002 and 2003 was the first peak of popularity for \"The Fairly OddParents\". Its ratings skyrocketed. The series appeared in a $50 Best Western travel card during summer 2006 and again in summer 2007.\n\nA theatrical film based on the series was planned for release by Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies, but it was eventually dropped because of a management change at Paramount, although the script was written. Hartman stated on his website that he would like to release the film on DVD one day, but there were not definitive plans to do so.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, Butch Hartman announced on his forum that Nickelodeon had ceased production of the show. \"The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators\" was intended to be the fifth-season finale and series finale in production order, airing on July 21, 2006. However, Nickelodeon broadcast the episode \"Timmy the Barbarian/No Substitute for Crazy\" after \"The Jerkinators\" as the fifth-season finale, on November 25 of that year.\n\nHartman announced on his forum on February 2, 2007, that Nick granted \"Fairly OddParents\" twenty more episode slots, making sure the show resumed production. Later on July 7, \"77 Secrets of the Fairly OddParents Revealed\" hinted that a new character would join the series.\n\nAfter a one-year hiatus, Nickelodeon announced on TV that they would begin the broadcast of a television movie called \"Fairly OddBaby\" as the beginning of at least 20 episodes of Season 6, and to carry the show to at least the year 2011. A huge hit, \"Fairly OddBaby\" aired on February 18, 2008, becoming the top entertainment program across broadcast and basic cable TV for the year among kids.\n\nOn March 14, 2012, the series was renewed for a ninth season with new episodes that were scheduled to broadcast that year. Additionally, the second live action film, \"A Fairly Odd Christmas\", aired in November 2012. The ninth season premiered the same day as the 2013 Kids Choice Awards. The ninth season introduced another character, Timmy's fairy dog, Sparky. Season nine is also the first season to be formatted in high definition and widescreen. In 2013, it was announced there would be a third installment called \"A Fairly Odd Summer\" with Drake Bell and Daniella Monet reprising their respective roles. The movie premiered on August 2, 2014. New episodes were confirmed by Fred Seibert on April 11, 2015.\n\nOn August 17, 2015, a tenth season was announced, and introduced another character, Chloe Carmichael, Timmy's new neighbor who also has Cosmo and Wanda as her fairy godparents. The tenth season aired from January 15, 2016, to July 26, 2017, on both Nickelodeon and Nicktoons.\n\nIn 2004, Butch Hartman revealed his intentions to make a \"Crash Nebula\" spin-off. The pilot episode \"Crash Nebula\" was aired as part of the show's fourth season. Despite this, Nickelodeon decided to not pick up the series. However, in 2006, Hartman stated that he was confident and would try to get the spin-off greenlighted in the future. He also wrote a script entitled \"Crash Nebula: The Movie\" for Paramount Pictures, but the film was cancelled due to its similarities with Disney's \"Sky High\".\n\nIn 2005 or 2006, Butch Hartman had also considered making a theatrical adaptation of his animated television series \"The Fairly OddParents\" after the show's initial cancellation in 2006, produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Paramount Pictures. The film was to be animated much like the series as well as previous Nickelodeon fare such as the \"Rugrats\" film series and \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\", but was scrapped due to a management change at Paramount although the script was already written. Despite this, Hartman expressed interest in releasing the film for DVD someday, and stated that the script could serve for another TV movie of the show. However, with the show's cancellation on July 26, 2017 and Butch Hartman's decision to leave Nickelodeon in early 2018, it seemingly ends any chances of that happening.\n\nDuring its original 5–season run, the series received immensely positive reviews despite some criticism for focusing solely on child-based humor while other Nickelodeon shows such as \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" included adult-based humor and dark humor.\n\nDespite concerns about if the show would jump the shark, the introduction of the character Poof in \"Fairly OddBaby\" was well received. Seasons 6 through 8 received positive reviews even as several possible finales such as the \"Wishology\" Trilogy and \"Timmy's Secret Wish\" airing with the show continuing afterwards.\n\nThe introduction of the character Sparky in season 9 was heavily criticized with the character being deemed unnecessary and annoying. His introduction, seen as an attempt to increase ratings, has been compared to the character Scrappy-Doo in the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise. As a result, his character was removed for season 10.\n\n"}

The episodes collected in the release form the end of the series' mythology, and are centered on those that involve the alien \"Super Soldiers\" and Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) son, William.\n\nThe collection contains seven episodes from the eighth season and seven from the ninth. The episodes follow the investigations of paranormal-related cases, or X-Files, by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick), following Scully's former partner Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) abduction by aliens. The two are assisted by Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). Events covered in the episodes include: the return, death, and resurrection of Mulder; the birth of Scully's child, William; the discovery of the \"Super Soldier\" conspiracy; the discovery of the remains of a space ship in Canada; Scully's choice to give William up for adoption; and Mulder's trial, conviction, escape, and discovery of the truth.\n\nThe collection contains the final episodes in the series' mythology, or fictional overarching story. The release features the closure of most of the series' long-running arcs. Production for the episodes was drastically affected after co-star Duchovny left the show. Released on November 22, 2005, the collection received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Adam Baldwin, Chris Owens, Nicholas Lea, Laurie Holden, and William B. Davis all play supporting roles in the collection.\n\nWhen Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) learns that several women have reportedly been abducted and impregnated with alien babies, she begins to question her own pregnancy. John Doggett (Robert Patrick) introduces Scully to Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), an FBI specialist in ritualistic crime, shortly before Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) deceased body suddenly appears in a forest at night. Following Mulder's funeral, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is threatened by Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) that he must kill Scully's baby before it is born. Billy Miles, a multiple abductee who disappeared on the same night as Mulder, is returned deceased but his dead body is resurrected and restored to full health. Mulder also returns from death, with Scully supervising his recovery. Fully rejuvenated, Mulder investigates several X-Files, against orders to do so, but soon gets fired, leaving Doggett in charge of the cases. Mulder continues to provide input in an unofficial capacity.\n\nReluctantly accepting Krycek's assistance, Mulder, Doggett and Skinner learn that an alien virus recently created in secret by members of the United States government have replaced several humans, including Miles and several high-ranking FBI personnel, with so-called alien \"Super Soldiers\". Krycek claims that the soldiers are virtually unstoppable aliens who want to make sure that humans will not survive the colonization of Earth. They have learned that Scully's baby is a miraculously special child and are afraid that it may be greater than them. When Miles arrives at the FBI Headquarters, Mulder, Doggett, Skinner and Krycek help Scully to escape along with Reyes who drives her to a remote farm. Shortly after Skinner kills Krycek, Scully delivers an apparently normal baby while the alien \"Super Soldiers\" surround her. Without explanation, the aliens leave the area as Mulder arrives. While Doggett and Reyes report to the FBI Headquarters, Mulder takes Scully and their newborn son, William, back to her apartment.\n\nMulder goes into hiding, Scully is again reassigned to the FBI Academy, and Reyes becomes Doggett's new FBI partner at the X-Files office. Doggett, Scully, and Reyes discover a conspiracy to place Chloramine in the nation's water, causing mutations and creating \"Super Soldiers\". This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment is taking place on board, with connections to Scully's child, William. The X-Files office's investigation is hampered by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) and Assistant Director Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes). Hopeful about reuniting with Mulder, a complete stranger, \"Shadow Man\" (Terry O'Quinn), offers his service to drive Mulder out of hiding. Scully takes the offer, but near gets herself and Mulder killed when it is revealed the man is a Super Soldier. Later on, Scully, Doggett and Reyes find evidence of a dangerous UFO cult which has found a spacecraft similar to one Scully studied in Africa two years ago. The cult kidnaps William, but is destroyed when the baby's crying activates the ship, killing everyone in the cult, sans William.\n\nDoggett finds a strange disfigured man in the X-Files office. Initially, Doggett believes the man is Mulder, but he is revealed to Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), Mulder's half-brother. Spender sticks a needle into William, which the other agents believe to be a virus of some kind, but is later revealed to be a cure for William's powers. Mulder returns from hiding to only be discovered looking for classified information at an army base and, after allegedly killing an apparently indestructible \"Super Soldier\" Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin), he is placed on trial to defend the X-Files and himself. But with the help of Kersh, Scully, Reyes, Doggett, Spender, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden) and Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka), Mulder breaks out. Mulder and Scully travel to New Mexico to find an old \"wise man\", who is later revealed to be The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), who tells them that the aliens will arrive in 2012. Doggett and Reyes aid Mulder and Scully in escaping the FBI, and the two are last seen together in a motel room facing an uncertain future.\n\nAfter settling his contract dispute with Fox, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season. In order to explain Mulder's absence, Duchovny's character was abducted by aliens in the seventh season finale, \"Requiem.\" After several rounds of contractual discussions, Duchovny agreed to return for a total of 11 eighth season episodes. Thus, \"Per Manum\" marked the return of Duchovny as Mulder, although he had appeared briefly in flashback appearances and small cameos. Series creator Chris Carter later argued that Mulder's absences from the series did not affect the characterization, noting that \"there are characters who can be powerful as absent centers, as Mulder was through the eight and ninth seasons.\"\n\nAfter the end of the eighth season, Duchovny announced that he would leave the show for good. In addition, lead actress Anderson's contract also expired at the end of the eighth season. Anderson had expressed her growing disinterest in the series ever since the beginning of the eighth season, saying \"For a lot of people, if you don't like your job, you can quit your job, I don't necessarily have that option.\" Anderson cited the fact that \"eight years is a long time\" as a contributing factor to her indifference. However, Carter soon changed his position and announced he would remain on the show and continue only if Anderson agreed to do another season. Eventually, Fox offered Anderson a \"generous\" incentive to stay, resulting in the retention of Carter and Anderson and a final season of the show. With the departure of Duchovny and limited use of Anderson, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, saying the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show together for the first seven seasons of the show.\n\nGoing into the ninth season, the producers decided to drastically change the show. The style of the opening credits in \"Nothing Important Happened Today\" were changed from the original credits, which, more or less, had been the same for the previous eight seasons. The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi. The finale episode of the series, \"The Truth\", was written by series creator Carter; he later noted, \"It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract us from what was really going on. The band was breaking up.\" He expounded on the idea, saying, \"Frank [Spotnitz] and I [decided] it was probably time to go […] it was strange to be writing these things knowing it was the last time we'd see Scully doing certain things or hear Mulder saying certain things.\" Spotnitz explained, \"What was kind of nice that Chris made the announcement in January is that we had times to wrap our minds around the end and plan for it and give all of the characters their due.\" Gish later said, \"I have a great respect for the elegant in which they're closing the curtain\". Bruce Harwood called the finale the \"passing of a generation\".\n\nThe collection, as well as the episodes themselves, received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Monica Kuebler of \"Exclaim!\" gave the collection a rather negative review and noted that it closed on a \"lacklustre note\". Furthermore, she wrote that the main issue with the release was that \"the hardcore fans [of the series] had come to see \"The X-Files\" as Mulder and Scully and understandably weren't quick to swallow a couple of new characters running the department.\" Ultimately, she concluded that the poor episodes and the lack of bonus features included with the collection were proof that \"Fox seems eager to wash their hands of the disappointing demise of the show\".\n\nSabadino Parker from \"PopMatters\" wrote negatively about the mythology of the last two seasons, noting that \"story itself became even more convoluted\" and that \"the past two seasons should never have happened.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" reviewer Ken Tucker speculated that Chris Carter was the only one who seemed to understand the show's complex mytharc. Joyce Millman from \"The New York Times\" called the storyline involving Scully's child—which left her \"haunted and irritable\"—\"a sad misuse of the radiant Anderson\". \"The A.V. Club\" was highly critical of the final season and its mythology story, calling them a \"clumsy mish-mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so-called 'super soldiers'\".\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nA.

{"id": "33998230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33998230", "title": "Theatre pedagogy", "text": "Theatre pedagogy\n\nTheatre pedagogy () is an independent discipline combining both theatre and pedagogy. As a field that arose during the 20th century, theatre pedagogy has developed separately from drama education, the distinction being that the drama teacher typically teaches method, theory and/or practice of performance alone, while theatre pedagogy integrates both art and education to develop language and strengthen social awareness. Theatre pedagogy is rooted in drama and stagecraft, yet works to educate people outside the realm of theatre itself.\n\nAs a movement, theatre pedagogy has many founders. In Germany, where it is widely recognized and practiced, Hans-Wolfgang Nickel is cited as a pioneer in theatre pedagogy with the founding of the Berlin Stage Teachers in 1959. Nickel later became a professor of theatre games and educational activities at the Berlin School of Education in 1974.\n\nAnother well known German theatre pedagogue is Hans Martin Ritter who, starting in 1973, ran a series of tests using Bertholt Brecht's model of learning through play. Ritter's aim was to develop an interdisciplinary project method for the school using theater as a form of teaching and learning. These tests led Ritter to co-found a nationwide pilot program in merging the fields of theatre and education.\n\nPerhaps theatre pedagogy's most internationally known theorist and practitioner is Brazilian director/facilitator Augusto Boal, who created Theatre of the Oppressed, now practiced by millions of people in more than 70 nations.\n\nThe primary purpose of theatre pedagogy is to bring about change in understanding the world around us. In achieving this objective, several other skills are taught and learned. These include:\n\n\nTheatre pedagogy enhances these forms of communication to facilitate human interaction, helping participants to learn about themselves, their peers, and their surrounding world. Rooted both in traditional education and amateur theater, the field of theatre pedagogy has grown to span many sectors, including:\n\n\nPractitioners of theatre pedagogy operate with a situation-oriented educational framework, usually using the medium of theatre as a vehicle to achieve an objective. Through this method, theatre pedagogy gives access to participants' own ideas and impulses, expanding the avenues of communication and interaction with the self and one's sociocultural environment. Through the use of gesture, intonation, facial expression, and behavior onstage, participants analyze these performative aspects created by the dramatic tension of everyday life. Through these physical and personality-affected models, real-life situations can more clearly express themselves.\n\nTheatre pedagogy is taught at universities and colleges, though training in the field is not regulated by state guidelines. In Germany one can receive a theatre pedagogy degree both at the undergraduate and graduate level, and many German cities have theatre pedagogy centers that provide less formal and unregulated training. Similar to these are the Centers for Theatre of the Oppressed, such as CTO Rio in Brazil and the Theatre of the Oppressed Laboratory in New York City where people can receive theatre pedagogy training using Augusto Boal and Paulo Freire's methods.\n\nIn the United States, three higher education institutions with strong theatre and drama pedagogy programs are CUNY School of Professional Studies MA in Applied Theatre, New York University Steinhardt's Educational Theatre program, and Emerson College's MA in Theatre Education.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "198661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198661", "title": "Witch of Endor", "text": "Witch of Endor\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the Witch of Endor is a woman who summons the prophet Samuel's spirit, at the demand of King Saul of the Kingdom of Israel in the 28th chapter of the \"First Book of Samuel\". The witch is absent from the version of that event recounted in the deuterocanonical \"Book of Sirach\" (46:19–20).\n\nShe is called in Biblical Hebrew אֵ֥שֶׁת בַּֽעֲלַת־אֹ֖וב בְּעֵ֥ין דֹּֽור (\"’êšeṯ ba‘ălaṯ-’ōḇ bə-‘Êndōr\"), \"a woman, possessor of an \"’ōḇ\" at Endor\". The word אֹ֖וב \"’ōḇ\" has been suggested by Harry Hoffner to refer to a ritual pit for summoning the dead from the netherworld, based on parallels in other Near Eastern and Mediterranean cultures. The word has cognates in other regional languages (cf. Sumerian \"ab\", Akkadian \"âbu\", Hittite \"a-a-bi\", Ugaritic \"ib\") and the witch of Endor's ritual has parallels in Babylonian and Hittite magical texts as well as the Odyssey. Other suggestions for a definition of \"’ōḇ\" include a familiar spirit, a talisman, wineskin, or a reference to ventriloquism based on the Septuagint translation.\n\nThe witch also claims to see \"elohim arising\" (plural verb) from the ground, using the word typically translated as \"god(s)\" to refer to the spirits of the dead. This is also paralleled by the use of the Akkadian cognate word \"ilu\" \"god\" in a similar fashion.\n\nIn the Greek Septuagint, she is called ἐγγαστρίμυθος ἐν Αενδωρ \"engastrímythos en Aendōr\", while the Latin Vulgate as \"pythonem in Aendor\", both terms referencing then-contemporary pagan oracles.\n\nWhen Samuel dies, he is buried in Ramah. Saul, the current King of Israel, seeks wisdom from God in choosing a course of action against the assembled forces of the Philistines. He receives no answer from dreams, prophets, or the Urim and Thummim. Having driven out all necromancers and magicians from Israel, Saul searches for a witch anonymously and in disguise. His search leads him to a woman of Endor, who claims that she can see the ghost of Samuel rising from the abode of the dead.\n\nThe voice of the prophet's ghost at first frightens the witch of Endor, and after complaining of being disturbed, berates Saul for disobeying God, and predicts Saul's downfall. The spirit reiterates a pre-mortem prophecy by Samuel, adding that Saul will perish with his whole army in battle the next day. Saul is terrified. The next day, his army is defeated as prophesied, and Saul commits suicide.\n\nAlthough Saul is depicted as an enemy to witches and diviners, the Witch of Endor comforts Saul when she sees his distress and insists on feeding him before he leaves.\n\nSince this passage never states that the witch was responsible for the appearance of Samuel's spirit, and it states the witch made a loud cry in fear when she saw Samuel's spirit, scholars believe that the witch had actually never acted as a medium between Saul and Samuel and summoned Samuel's spirit to begin with but, rather, this was the work of God in the passage. Joyce Baldwin writes that \"The Incident does not tell us anything about the veracity of claims to consult the dead on the part of mediums, because the Indications are that this was an extraordinary event for her (the woman), and a frightening one because she was not in control.\"\n\nThe \"Yalkut Shimoni\" (11th century) identifies the anonymous witch as the mother of Abner. Based upon the witch's claim to have seen something, and Saul having heard a disembodied voice, the \"Yalkut\" suggests that necromancers are able to see the spirits of the dead but are unable to hear their speech, while the person for whom the deceased was summoned hears the voice but fails to see anything.\n\nAntoine Augustin Calmet briefly mentioned the witch of Endor in his \"Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &c.\" (1759):\n\nThe Church Fathers and some modern Christian writers have debated the theological issues raised by this text. The story of King Saul and the Witch of Endor would appear at first sight to affirm that it is possible (though forbidden) for humans to summon the spirits of the dead by magic.\n\nIn the Septuagint (2nd century BC) the woman is described as a \"ventriloquist\", possibly reflecting the consistent view of the Alexandrian translators concerning \"demons... which exist not\". However, Josephus (1st century) appears to find the story completely credible (\"Antiquities of the Jews\" 6,14).\nKing James wrote in his philosophical treatise Daemonologie (1597) arguing against the ventriloquist theory, stating that the Devil is permitted at times to put himself in the likeness of the Saints, citing 2 Corinthians 11:14 that \"Satan can transform himself into an Angel of light\". James describes the witch of Endor as \"Saul's Pythonese\", likening her to Pythia from the Greek mythology of Python and the Oracle. It was the belief of James that the witch of Endor was an avid practitioner of necromancy:\n\nOther medieval glosses to the Bible also suggested that what the witch summoned was not the ghost of Samuel, but a demon taking his shape or an illusion crafted by the witch. Martin Luther, who believed that the dead were unconscious, read that it was \"the Devil's ghost\", whereas John Calvin read that \"it was not the real Samuel, but a spectre.\"\n\nSpiritualists have taken the story as evidence of spirit mediumship in ancient times. The story has been cited in debates between Spiritualist apologists and Christian critics. \"The woman of Endor was a medium, respectable, honest, law-abiding, and far more Christ-like than\" Christian critics of Spiritualism, asserted one Chicago Spiritualist paper in 1875.\n\nCalmet states,\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29657012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29657012", "title": "World Wireless System", "text": "World Wireless System\n\nThe World Wireless System was a turn of the 20th century proposed telecommunications and electrical power delivery system designed by inventor Nikola Tesla based on his theories of using Earth and its atmosphere as electrical conductors. He claimed this system would allow for \"the transmission of electric energy without wires\" on a global scale as well as point-to-point wireless telecommunications and broadcasting. He made public statements citing two related methods to accomplish this from the mid-1890s on. By the end of 1900 he had convinced banker J. P. Morgan to finance construction of a wireless station (eventually sited at Wardenclyffe) based on his ideas intended to transmit messages across the Atlantic to England and to ships at sea. His decision to change the design to include wireless power transmission to better compete with Guglielmo Marconi's new radio based telegraph system was met with Morgan's refusal to fund the changes. The project was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational.\n\nDuring this period Tesla filed numerous patents associated with the basic functions of his system, including transformer design, transmission methods, tuning circuits, and methods of signaling. He also described a plan to have some thirty Wardenclyffe-style telecommunications stations positioned around the world to be tied into existing telephone and telegraph systems. He would continue to elaborate to the press and in his writings for the next few decades on the system's capabilities and how it was superior to radio-based systems.\n\nDespite claims of having \"carried on practical experiments in wireless transmission\", there is no documentation he ever transmitted power beyond relatively short distances and modern scientific opinion is generally that his wireless power scheme would not have worked.\n\nTesla's ideas for a World Wireless system grew out of experiments beginning in the early 1890s after learning of Hertz's experiments with electromagnetic waves using induction coil transformers and spark gaps. He duplicated those experiments and then went on to improve Hertz's wireless transmitter, developing various alternator apparatus and his own high tension transformer, known as the Tesla coil. His primary interest in wireless phenomenon was as a power distribution system, early on pursuing wireless lighting. From 1891 on Tesla was delivering lectures including \"\" in 1892 in London and in Paris and went on to demonstrate \"wireless lighting\" in 1893 including lighting Geissler tubes wirelessly.\n\nThe first experiment was the operation of light and motive devices connected by a single wire to one terminal of a high frequency induction coil, performed during the 1891 New York City lecture at Columbia College. While a single terminal incandescent lamp connected to one of an induction coil’s secondary terminals does not form a closed circuit \"in the ordinary acceptance of the term\" the circuit is closed in the sense that a return path is established back to the secondary by capacitive coupling or 'displacement current'. This is due to the lamp’s filament or refractory button capacitance relative to the coil’s free terminal and environment; the free terminal also has capacitance relative to the lamp and environment.\n\nThe second result demonstrated how energy can be made to go through space without any connecting wires. The wireless energy transmission effect involves the creation of an electric field between two metal plates, each being connected to one terminal of an induction coil’s secondary winding. A gas discharge tube was used as a means of detecting the presence of the transmitted energy. Some demonstrations involved lighting of two partially evacuated tubes in an alternating electrostatic field while held in the hand of the experimenter.\n\nWhile formulating his theories in the early 1890s Tesla discarded the idea of using radio waves. He did not necessarily believe that radio waves existed as theorized by Maxwell, and he agreed with what most physicists were saying at the time: that radio waves would travel in a straight line in the same way that visible light travels, limiting their use for long-range communication. (Radio waves do travel in a straight line, but this was many years before the discovery that the ionosphere would reflect certain radio waves making skywave communication of shortwave frequency bands possible over long distances.)\n\nHe believed that transmitting electrical signals beyond a line-of-sight distance would require the use of planet Earth as a conducting medium to overcome this limitation. By the end of 1895, he made statements to the press about the possibility that \"\"Earth's electrical charge can be disturbed, and thereby electrical waves can be efficiently transmitted to any distance without the use of cables or wires\", and that the electrical waves can be used to transmit \"intelligible signals\" and \"motive power\".\" On April 11, 1896, he stated that \"\"messages might be conducted to all parts of the globe simultaneously\" using electric waves \"propagated through the atmosphere and even the ether beyond\".\" In September 1897 he applied for a patent on a wireless power transmission scheme consisting of transmitting power between two tethered balloons maintained at 30,000 feet, an altitude where he thought a conductive layer should exist.\n\nBetween 1895 and 1898, he constructed a large resonance transformer in his New York City lab called a magnifying transmitter to test his earth conduction theories. In 1899 he carried out large scale experiments at Colorado Springs, Colorado. Based on his measurements there, he concluded that the Earth was \"literally alive with electrical vibrations.\" He noted that lightning strikes indicate that the Earth is a large conductor with waves of energy traveling around the Earth. He constructed a large magnifying transmitter measuring in diameter which could develop a working potential estimated at 3.5 million to 4 million volts and was capable of producing electrical discharges exceeding in length. With it he tested earth conduction and lit incandescent electric lamps adjacent to his lab in demonstrations of wireless power transmission.\n\nUpon returning to New York City from Colorado Springs in 1900 he sought venture capitalists to fund what he viewed as a revolutionary wireless communication and electric power delivery system using the Earth as the conductor. By the end of 1900 he had gained the attention of financier J. P. Morgan who agreed to fund a pilot project (later to become the Wardenclyffe project) which, based on his theories, would be capable of transmitting messages, telephony, and even facsimile images across the Atlantic to England and to ships at sea. Morgan was to receive a controlling share in the company as well as half of all the patent income. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial wireless power transmission to better compete with Guglielmo Marconi's radio based telegraph system. Morgan refused to fund the changes and, when no additional investment capital became available, the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational.\n\nConstruction of the Wardenclyffe \"wireless plant\" in Shoreham started towards the end of 1901 and continued for the next three years. The plant included a Stanford White designed brick building, a wood-framed tower tall with a in diameter \"cupola\" on top, and a shaft sunk into the ground with sixteen iron pipes driven \"one length after another\" below the shaft in order for the machine, in Tesla's words, \"to have a grip on the earth so the whole of this globe can quiver.\" Funding problems continued to plague Wardenclyffe and by 1905-1906 most of the site's activity had to be shut down.\n\nThrough the latter part of the 1890s and during the construction of Wardenclyffe, Tesla applied for patents covering the many elements that would make up his wireless system. The system he came up with was based on electrical conduction with an electrical charge being conducted through the ground and as well as through a theorized conducting layer in the atmosphere. The design consisted of a grounded Tesla coil as a resonance transformer transmitter that he thought would be able to create a displacement of Earth's electric charge by alternately charging and discharging the oscillator's elevated terminal. This would work in conjunction with a second Tesla coil used in receive mode at a distant location, also with a grounded helical resonator and an elevated terminal. He believed that the placement of a grounded resonance transformer at another point on the Earths surface in the role of a receiver tuned to the same frequency as the transmitter would allow electric current to flow through the Earth between the two. He also believed waves of electric current from the sending tower could be made to reflect back from the far side of the globe, resulting in amplified stationary waves of electric current that could be utilized at any point on the globe, localizing power delivery directly to the receiving station. Another aspect of his system was electricity returned via \"an equivalent electric displacement\"\" in the atmosphere via a charged conductive upper layer that he thought existed, a theory dating back to an 1872 idea for a proposed wireless transmission-reception system developed by Mahlon Loomis. The current could be used at the receiver for telecommunications and to drive electrical devices.\n\nTesla told a friend his plans included the building of more than thirty transmission-reception stations constructed near major population centers around the world with Wardenclyffe being the first. If plans had moved forward without interruption the Long Island prototype would have been followed by a second plant built in the British Isles, perhaps on the west coast of Scotland near Glasgow. Each of these facilities was to include a large magnifying transmitter of a design loosely based upon the apparatus assembled at the Colorado Springs experimental station in 1899.\n\nTesla's description of his wireless transmission ideas in 1895 include its humanitarian uses in bringing abundant electrical energy to remote underdeveloped parts of the world and fostering closer communications amongst nations. His June, 1900 Century Magazine article \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\", he elaborated on the properties of the Earth and on the principles of a system, which could use the Earth as the medium for communication and the transmission of power without wires. He wrote that communications at any distance was practicable. He also noted this same process could be used to locate maritime objects such as icebergs or ships at sea and that \"electrical movement of such magnitude\" could communicate with other planets.\n\nIn 1909 Tesla stated:\n\nHe also believed that high potential electric current flowing through the upper atmosphere could make it glow, providing night time lighting for transoceanic shipping lanes.\n\nHe elaborated on World Wireless in his 1919 \"Electrical Experimenter\" article titled \",\" detailing its ability for long range telecommunications and putting forward his view that the prevailing theory of radio wave propagation was inaccurate.\n\nTesla's demonstrations of wireless power transmission at Colorado Springs consisted of lighting incandescent electric lamps positioned nearby the structure housing his large experimental magnifying transmitter, with ranges out to from the transmitter. There is little direct evidence of his having transmitted power beyond these photographically documented demonstrations. He would claim afterwards that he had, \"carried on practical experiments in wireless transmission.\" He believed that he had achieved Earth electrical resonance that, according to his theory, would produce electrical effects at any terrestrial distance. \n\nThere have been varied claims over the years regarding Tesla's accomplishments with his wireless system. His own notes from Colorado Springs are unclear as to whether he was ever successful at long range transmission. Tesla made a claim in a 1916 statement to attorney Drury W. Cooper that in 1899 he collected quantitative transmission-reception data at a distance of about . Tesla biographer John J. O'Neill made a claim in his 1944 book \"Prodigal Genius: The life of Nikola Tesla\" that in 1899 at Colorado Springs Tesla lit 200 incandescent lamps at a distance of . The writer Marc Seifer in his book \"Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla\" noted opinion amongst Tesla proponents that ranged from the idea not being practicable, to claims that some of Tesla's observations were valid. Other investigators have stated that Tesla over-estimated the conductivity of the Earth and the atmosphere, and vastly underestimated the loss of power over distance.\n\n\n\n\n"}
