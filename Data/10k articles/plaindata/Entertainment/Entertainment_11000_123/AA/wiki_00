{"id": "3907805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3907805", "title": "9 (2005 film)", "text": "9 (2005 film)\n\n9 is a 2005 computer animated short film created by Shane Acker as a student project at the UCLA Animation Workshop. Tim Burton saw the film and was so impressed by its artistic vision that he went on to produce a feature-length adaptation also titled \"9\", directed by Acker and distributed by Focus Features. The film was presented at the Indianapolis International Film Festival. It was nominated for an Academy Award for best animated short film, but lost to \"\", although it did win a Student Academy Award for Best Animation.\n\n9 is a sentient rag doll who appears to be the last of his kind, living in the ruins of a decaying, post-apocalyptic Earth. He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse – a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\n\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor, 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire and a watch battery. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\n\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman, leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.\n\nThe Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette – the dummy created by 9 at the beginning of the film. The Beast's claws stick in the tar and 9 is able to hop onto its back and steal the Beast's talisman. 9 leads the Beast on a panicked chase through the house and finally runs out onto the end of a broken plank, which extends over a several-story drop. Thinking it has 9 cornered, the Beast walks out onto the plank. But it has fallen into 9's trap.\n\nNearby is the metal armature, and the upright book. 9 leaps off the plank onto the armature, which swings him around to the book. He kicks it and it falls into the pit. The string, tied at one end to the book, has its other end tied to the plank. The weight of the falling book drags the plank into the pit, and the Beast with it. The Beast crashes through a hole in the cellar floor and is presumably impaled by the sharp end of the falling plank. This all reveals that all the things that 9 has built was a cleverly-made trap for the Beast.\n\nNow free from fear, 9 salvages the skins of the other rag dolls and prepares them to be ceremonially burned. As he looks sadly at the skin of 5, the two talismans begin to glow. 9 realizes that they are two halves of a whole and puts them together. A beam of green light erupts from the united talisman, and the spirits of the eight slain rag dolls 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 emerge, returning to their rag doll skins to be at peace. Before disappearing, 5's soul turns to 9 and nods in approval.\n\nIn the morning, when the ashes have cooled, 9 – bearing the light bulb staff, a symbol of the persistent light of knowledge and learning – walks off into the wasteland, leaving the empty talisman behind in the sand.\n\nThe short film took four and a half years, on and off, to create. Originally, Acker wanted to make it as stop motion, but then went for CGI when realizing it would have turned out too expensive. He used Maya 1.5–5.5 for 3D modeling, Photoshop for the textures, After Effects for compositing, and Premiere for editing. There are homages to Acker's influences like Brothers Quay and Pixar placed throughout. Most of it was rendered at 720x540 pixels on a three-computer dual-processor render farm. For distribution at film festivals like Sundance, Rhythm and Hues Studios offered to print the short film to 35mm using their film printer and image resizing techniques. The credits show that beyond Acker, there were five other animators and three other lighters that worked on the film. The music was provided by Eric Olsen and his band the Earganic.\n\n\n\n\"9\" is a computer animated feature film (which the short film was released with the DVD release of) adapted from the short film. It was produced in part by Tim Burton, Timur Bekmambetov, and Jim Lemley, and released on September 9, 2009 (09/09/09) by Focus Features.\n\nShane Acker directed the film and wrote the original story. Pamela Pettler wrote the script. The lead voice actors are Elijah Wood, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, Crispin Glover, Martin Landau, Christopher Plummer and Fred Tatasciore.\n\n\n"}

They generated extensive, negative publicity for ACORN, and led to the U.S. Census Bureau and the IRS ending their contracts with ACORN, the U.S. Congress suspending its funding, and ACORN losing most of its private funding. This was despite several independent investigations that by December 2009 began to reveal no criminal activity by ACORN staff had taken place.\n\nACORN filed for Chapter 7 liquidation on November 2, 2010, effectively closing the organization.\n\nHannah Giles (born March 15, 1989) is an American conservative activist. Her father is a conservative Christian pastor, Doug Giles. She came to national attention with James O'Keefe in the United States in September 2009 as a featured player in videos they had filmed secretly in encounters at offices of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). At the time, Giles was studying journalism at Florida International University. Following the videos' release and extensive media coverage, she dropped out of college to \"pursue demands to keep up with public appearances and job offers.\" Giles and O'Keefe spent $1,300 to accomplish what \"Washington Post\" reporters called a \"Mission to Fell ACORN\".\nJames E. O'Keefe III (born June 28, 1984) is an American conservative activist-filmmaker who came to national attention in the United States in September 2009 with the release of his ACORN undercover videos. O'Keefe worked for about a year at the Leadership Institute, led by Morton Blackwell. O'Keefe has described his politics as \"progressive radical”, although media coverage and his own activities consistently paint him as a conservative. He has expressed admiration for the philosophies of British writer G.K. Chesterton and Soviet dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. He has made additional secret videos since then, also found to have been heavily edited to misrepresent his subjects, or present them in the worst light. On January 26, 2010, O'Keefe was arrested with three colleagues, including Robert Flanagan, the son of the acting U.S. Attorney of the Eastern District of Louisiana, and initially charged with a federal felony for attempting to maliciously interfere with the office telephone system of U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu and to tape conversations of her and her staff. They later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and were given minor sentences including community service.\n\nIn July and August 2009, Giles and O'Keefe visited ACORN offices in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, San Bernardino, San Diego, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami. Giles dressed as a prostitute, while O'Keefe wore white khakis with a blue dress shirt and/or tie and claimed to be her boyfriend. Giles and O'Keefe recorded the encounters using hidden cameras and pretended to be seeking advice on how to run an illegal business that included the use of underage girls in the sex trade.\n\nEdited videos from the visits to ACORN offices in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, San Bernardino, and San Diego were released between September 10 and September 17, 2009, and were used to launch Andrew Breitbart's BigGovernment.com website.\n\nIn the videos, O'Keefe included segments in which he wore a fur coat, top hat, sunglasses, and wielded a cane, giving viewers, including the media, the impression that he had dressed that way when he visited the ACORN offices and spoke to its workers. As part of the deception and distortion of the released videos, O'Keefe added that portion as a lead-in, but he was dressed professionally during his ACORN visits. He never revealed himself on camera in the visits to the ACORN offices.\n\nIn the Baltimore office, the released video lets viewers hear O'Keefe saying that he and Giles were bringing up thirteen girls from El Salvador \"like 15\" years of age to live in their house and work as prostitutes \"just to get them on their feet so they can do this type of thing.\" Giles remarks, \"they are kind of dependent.\" Although the Baltimore ACORN staffer pointed out their plans were illegal, after O'Keefe says, \"we are going to be putting a roof over [their] head\", the ACORN employee states, \"well then you know what you can always claim them as dependents.\" Later, the employee says, \"you are gonna use three of them they are gonna be under 16 so you is eligible to get child tax credit and additional child tax credit.\" When O'Keefe asks, \"what if they are going to be making money because they are performing tricks too?\" the employee replies, \"but if they making money and they are underage, then you shouldn't be letting anybody know anyway.\" The Baltimore employees were fired by ACORN after the video was released.\n\nIn the Washington, D.C., office, Giles and O'Keefe ask about how to account for Giles' anticipated prostitution income on tax forms. Giles asks, \"is there a way I can make up two years of tax returns?\" The ACORN employee replies, \"no you can't make it up\", but tells Giles that she could form a business and state that she provides a service. The employee says, \"you can have a business. She's not going to put down that she's doing prostitution\", and \"you don't have to sit back and tell people what it is you do.\" Giles later tells an ACORN employee that she will be giving the money earned from prostitution to O'Keefe. The employee says, \"when the police ask you – you don't know where it's coming from.\"\n\nIn the Brooklyn office, Giles and O'Keefe tell a loan counselor they want to buy a house, and that an abusive pimp is \"aggressively\" pursuing Giles. She \"wanted to leave because it is scary being subjected to a huge man who has control over your life.\" The ACORN counselor advises her \"you get a tin if [he] is going to come beat you... you get a tin and bury it down in there and you put the money right in and you put grass over it and you don't tell a single soul.\" When discussing getting a house and Giles' earnings, O'Keefe says that Giles is very honest and an ACORN counselor replies, \"honest is not going to get you the house that is why you probably been denied cause you probably going in saying.\" Another stated to Giles, \"you can't say what you do for a living.\" For tax and banking purposes, and to establish a legitimate income and credit history, Giles was told she needed to start saying she was a \"freelancer\". The ACORN employee also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks, depositing no more than $500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised.\n\nIn the San Bernardino office, ACORN employee Tresa Kaelke told O'Keefe and Giles they could classify the underage brothel as a \"group home\" to avoid detection; she suggested the pair \"invest in a line of vitamins\" to disguise the location's true purpose. Later, Kaelke stated she believed the activists were joking and made a variety of absurd or joking statements to them. She said they were \"somewhat entertaining, but they weren't even good actors.\" Office supervisor Christina Spach said Kaelke \"pretended to cooperate with O'Keefe and Giles because she feared for her safety.\" Kaelke responded to the pair's requests for help setting up a child-prostitution ring on the video by claiming to be an ex-prostitute and exclaiming, \"Heidi Fleiss is my hero!\" The California Attorney General's investigation of Kaelke determined that \"none of her claims\" on the video were true, that \"she was playing along with what she perceived as a joke\", and there was \"no evidence she had ever engaged in prostitution.\" According to CNN, the filmmakers released a transcript of their discussion with Kaelke that included a comment left out of the originally released tape in which Kaelke said that ACORN would have nothing to do with their prostitution business. Kaelke said that her supervisor \"would shoot this down faster than a bat out of hell\", but advised the couple to conceal the prostitution business by calling it a massage parlor. Kaelke was fired by ACORN after the videos were released.\n\nIn the San Diego office, edited video showed ACORN employee Juan Carlos Vera telling O'Keefe he had \"contacts\" in \"Tijuana\" to help get underage girls across the border. But, after the discussion with O'Keefe, Vera reported O'Keefe's fabricated plan for human smuggling to police. Vera was fired for what ACORN called \"unacceptable conduct\". Vera had said he tried to help the fake prostitute because she said that she needed to escape her controlling pimp. On July 8, 2010, after the AG's Report confirmed that he had contacted the police to try to thwart the couple's smuggling plan, Vera filed a civil suit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against O'Keefe and Giles for recording him without his permission, which was a violation of California law. In July 2012, Giles settled the case with Vera, leaving Vera's lawsuit with O'Keefe to move forward.\n\nIn response to release of the first videos, ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis said on Fox News on September 20, 2009, \"[i]n a way, this was good for us, so what it did was show up to us what weaknesses we have, and we have moved swiftly ... in order to correct that.\" She said that after viewing the tapes, she had fired all the employees featured and had begun a comprehensive external investigation. As ACORN learned more from its employees of what had taken place, it called the videos \"false\" and \"defamatory\". A spokesman accused O'Keefe of dubbing the audio on the videos. On September 23, 2009, ACORN filed suit in a Baltimore court against the filmmakers, citing \"extreme emotional distress\" of the ACORN workers and violation of two-party consent recording laws. It later allowed the suit to lapse.\n\nOn October 21, O'Keefe and Giles released video footage of their visit to the Philadelphia office of ACORN at a National Press Club conference. They claimed it was to show they had received help there, after an ACORN spokesman had said that the pair had been asked to leave the Philadelphia office. \"The Washington Post\" \"obtained a July 24 police report that showed police were called when O'Keefe and Giles attempted their sting at ACORN's Philadelphia offices—and that the couple were escorted out of those offices.\" Susan Kinzie of \"The Washington Post\" noted that \"the heavily edited footage includes audio of the two conservatives but none of the ACORN Housing Corp. worker's responses to their questions.\" Junette Marcano, a board member of Philadelphia ACORN, said, \"This is a targeted assault to disenfranchise our members because ... the right-wing agenda is to stop us from empowering people of low and moderate incomes. When you make the poor powerful, the powerful feel threatened.\"\n\nCarol Leonnig, a \"Washington Post\" staff writer who attended the press conference, said in an interview that day on Fox News that, in explaining why the audio portion did not include the worker's responses, O'Keefe said, \"on the one hand, the pair are concerned about the legal ramifications.\" O'Keefe claimed secondly \"that the tape battery died.\" Commenting on the Philadelphia video, Leonnig said \"when you go to this office, and you see this tape, I don't think he's got the goods to say that ACORN lied.\" Both Giles and O'Keefe declined to answer questions after the release of the October video.\n\nOn November 16, 2009, the pair released a video from their visit to the Los Angeles office of ACORN.\nOn March 19, 2010, \"The New York Times\" reported that ACORN was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy; 15 of the group's 30 state chapters had disbanded over the past six months, and other chapters (including the largest, in New York and California) had renamed themselves and severed all ties to the national organization. Two unnamed ACORN officials told the \"Times\" that the following weekend, a teleconference was planned to discuss a bankruptcy filing; \"private donations from foundations to Acorn [had] all but evaporated.\" The federal government had ended contracts with the group related to organizing counts in urban areas for the Census and work for the IRS. \"[L]ong before the activist videos delivered what may become the final blow, the organization was dogged for years by financial problems and accusations of fraud.\" Former co-chairwoman of ACORN's Maryland chapter Sonja Merchant-Jones said: \"That 20-minute video ruined 40 years of good work. But if the organization had confronted its own internal problems, it might not have been taken down so easily.\"\n\nOn March 22, 2010, National ACORN spokesman Kevin Whelan says the organization's board decided to close remaining state affiliates and field offices by April 1 because of falling revenues. On April 20, the ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis reported that ACORN was \"still alive. We're limping along. We're on life support.\" Lewis said that ACORN's annual budget had been reduced from $25 million to $4 million, and that its staff of 350 to 600 people had been reduced to four. Lewis explained the controversy had left a stain on ACORN, \"sort of like a scarlet letter.\" It had forced the group to spend money to respond to \"one investigation after another.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama stated the video content was \"certainly inappropriate and deserves to be investigated.\" ACORN's partnership in the 2010 United States Census was terminated on September 11, 2009. The United States Senate voted to exclude ACORN from federal funding on September 14, and the House of Representatives voted 345-75 to eliminate federal funding to ACORN on September 17. John Boehner, the Republican leader of the House, introduced HR 3571 the \"Defund ACORN Act\" on September 15, and Rep. Darrell Issa moved to incorporate that bill as an amendment to the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009 (HR 3221). Both resolutions were later nullified in a federal court ruling by Judge Nina Gershon that the measures were an unconstitutional bill of attainder. On August 13, 2010, however, a federal appeals court reversed that decision, and upheld the Congressional resolutions that cut off federal funding for ACORN.\n\nOn September 23, the Internal Revenue Service removed ACORN from its volunteer tax-assistance program. On September 24, the U.S. Treasury Department's Inspector General announced it would initiate a broader probe into \"the government's oversight of tax-exempt organizations like ACORN when they engage in political activities.\"\n\nOn September 16, 2009, ACORN suspended advising new clients and initiated an independent review process, headed by Scott Harshbarger, an attorney from the Proskauer Rose firm and a former Massachusetts Attorney General. On September 16, Bertha Lewis, ACORN's CEO, froze admission to all of ACORN's service programs and instituted a review committee to implement organizational reforms. The independent external investigation found that while some of the counsel given by employees and volunteers was \"unprofessional and inappropriate\", the videos that had been released appeared to have been edited, \"in some cases substantially\", and ACORN employees had taken no illegal actions.\n\nOn December 22, 2009, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) released a report on ACORN activities, commissioned by the House Judiciary Committee. It stated that ACORN has not been found to violate any federal regulations in the past five years. The report's other findings included that there were no instances of voter fraud by individuals who were allegedly registered to vote improperly by ACORN or its employees, and no instances where ACORN violated terms of federal funding in the last 5 years. The CRS found that O'Keefe and Giles may have violated Maryland and California laws banning the recording of face-to-face conversations without consent of both parties.\n\nThe New York Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo, began an investigation on September 15, 2009, to ensure that state grants given to ACORN were properly spent. The New York City Council suspended all ACORN grants while the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office conducted an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the videos. On March 1, 2010, the District Attorney's office for Brooklyn determined that the videos were \"heavily edited\" to give a misleading impression, and concluded that there was no criminal wrongdoing by the ACORN Brooklyn staff filmed in the videos. A law enforcement source said, \"They edited the tape to meet their agenda.\"\n\nOn September 25, 2009, in response to Governor Schwarzenegger's request to investigate the incidents, the California Attorney General's office opened an investigation \"into the controversy surrounding videos that purportedly show members of community organizing group ACORN giving advice on how to open a brothel.\"\n\nOn April 1, 2010, Attorney General Jerry Brown announced the office's findings, based on its review of new unedited videotapes recorded in the California offices of ACORN, as well as other evidence. The AG had granted O'Keefe and Giles immunity from prosecution in exchange for the raw videotapes. The report noted that the terms of the exchange did not exempt O'Keefe or Giles from being sued separately by the ACORN members filmed in the videos. Citing the 1967 Invasion of Privacy Act, Attorney General Office's report stated, \"an application of these principles to the facts presented here strongly suggests that O'Keefe and Giles violated state privacy laws and provides fair warning to them and others that this type of activity can be prosecuted in California.\"\n\nThe Attorney General Office criticized O'Keefe for not acting as a journalist trying to objectively report a story from the facts, noting instead that O'Keefe stated he \"was out to make a point and to damage ACORN.\" The report said:The video releases were heavily edited to feature only the worst or most inappropriate statements of the various ACORN employees and to omit some of the most salient statements by O'Keefe and Giles. Each of the ACORN employees recorded in California was a low level employee whose job was to help the needy individuals who walked in the door seeking assistance. Giles and O'Keefe lied to engender compassion, but then edited their statements from the released videos.For instance, one much-publicized recording had shown O'Keefe and Giles at the San Diego office. They show a worker purportedly seeking information from a contact in Mexico to help them smuggle underage girls from Mexico into the United States to work as prostitutes. The video did not show that the worker's \"contact\" in Mexico was a police official. The employee collected as much specific information from Giles and O'Keefe as possible during their visit. The worker then contacted Mexican police to warn them of the plot. The AG Office's report stated, \"ACORN was not the criminal enterprise described by O'Keefe in his 'Chaos for Glory' statement – it did not receive billions in federal funds and did not control elections. ACORN is, however, disorganized and its operations were far from transparent, leaving it vulnerable to allegations of illegal activity and misuse of funds.\" The report also noted that despite O'Keefe's appearing in the released videos in \"stereotypical 1970s pimp garb\", in his actual taped sessions with ACORN workers, he was dressed in a shirt and tie, presented himself as a law student, and said he planned to use the prostitution proceeds to run for Congress, and never claimed he was a pimp.\n\nThe report of the Attorney General Office concluded, \"Even if O'Keefe and Giles had truly intended to break the law, there is no evidence that any of the ACORN employees had the intent to aid and abet such criminal conduct or agreed to join in that illegal conduct.\" While faulting a few of the recorded ACORN members for \"terrible judgment and highly inappropriate behavior\", the investigation report also concluded that \"ACORN could determine that the conduct of its employees in California was inappropriate, but that is an employment matter, which does not rise to the level of a law enforcement or governmental concern\". The report determined that the employees did not commit prosecutable crimes in California. Regarding this contrast between the publicity related to the videos and what actually transpired, Attorney General Brown stated, \"The evidence illustrates that things are not always as partisan zealots portray them through highly selective editing of reality. Sometimes a fuller truth is found on the cutting room floor.\"\n\nOn June 14, 2010, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its findings on ACORN, by then disbanded. It said that there was no evidence that the group, or any of its related organizations, mishandled any of the $40 million in federal money that they had received in recent years.\n\nThe right-wing media complained about alleged media bias throughout the weeks as the ACORN video controversy developed. For instance, on September 15, Joshua Rhett Miller of Fox News accused the \"mainstream media\" of purposefully ignoring the story, and said that it was favoring the political left. Andrew Breitbart wrote in an article in \"The Washington Times\" that he had counseled Giles and O'Keefe to \"offer Fox News the full footage of each video before each was released.\" Breitbart said he developed a strategy to counter such presumed liberal media bias by courting the Fox News Corporation: \"We had to devise a plan that would force the [other news] media to see the evidence before they had enough time to destroy these two idealistic 20-something truth seekers.\" Giles interviewed exclusively with Fox commentator Glenn Beck on the day of the first video's release.\n\nCNN began coverage of the story as early as September 9. CBS began to cover the story on September 11, the day after the story aired on Fox News. Breitbart and reporters of Fox News stayed on message, complaining that the \"mainstream media\" did not respond promptly or cover the story in sufficient depth. On September 11, 2009, Glenn Beck was reported to have said, \"FOX has had 133 reports on it, CNN, 90, MSNBC, 10. How's that possible? Hey, ABC, how's it working out for you with two?\"\n\nBreitbart and O'Keefe on September 11 announced that O'Keefe would not agree to be interviewed by CNN staff. They said that CNN favored ACORN in its coverage. But, CNN had reported on ACORN-related issues of alleged voter registration fraud (which were not substantiated). O'Keefe said he felt CNN's early coverage had been slanted in favor of ACORN, because CNN had interviewed both ACORN staff members and defenders.\n\nFOX News said that, as late as September 15, the ABC anchor Charlie Gibson was unfamiliar with the story. It did not report that ABC's Jake Tapper had been covering the issue since September 11. In a September 15 interview with Sean Hannity of FOX News, Breitbart said that O'Keefe and Giles \"have been impugned in the media.\" Hannity said they had been \"excoriated\".\n\nOn September 17, 2009, Turner.com posted a list of all CNN transcripts covering the ACORN scandal, from the day the story was first released. The transcripts showed there was no evidence that Giles or O'Keefe had been \"impugned\" or \"excoriated\" by news commentators. The listed transcripts include extensive, objective coverage and discussion by CNN reporters Abbie Boudreau, Wolf Blitzer, Candy Crowley, and others. Lou Dobbs (then still at CNN) had offered an impassioned statement in support of Giles and O'Keefe on September 10, the day on which the videos were first aired.\n\nIn an interview with Alexandra Fenwick of the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" on September 18, 2009, journalist Mark Bowden of \"The Atlantic\" said about the case:The young woman and filmmaker who visited those ACORN offices were political activists, and they put together what is, in essence, a very effective political protest against an organization they would like to damage. And they've done a very effective job of doing that. But I think they're clearly not journalists.The next spring, on March 20, 2010, Clark Hoyt, public editor of \"The New York Times\", wrote an op-ed column conceding some errors in the paper's reporting. ACORN and its supporters had complained \"that \"The Times\" got the story wrong and, by failing to correct it, has played into the hands of a campaign that has pushed the group near extinction.\" Hoyt acknowledged that it was by then known that it was not likely that O'Keefe went into the ACORN offices dressed as a pimp, as at the beginning and end of most of the videos. O'Keefe had presented himself \"as a clean-cut young man, sometimes a college student, trying to rescue his girlfriend and under-age girls from an abusive pimp.\" But, Hoyt wrote:ACORN's supporters appear to hope that the whole story will fall apart over the issue of what O'Keefe wore: if that was wrong, everything else must be wrong. The record does not support them. If O'Keefe did not dress as a pimp, he clearly presented himself as one: a fellow trying to set up a woman — sometimes along with under-age girls — in a house where they would work as prostitutes.His article appeared before the release on April 1, 2010, of the California AG Report, which found that O'Keefe's videos had all been heavily edited to misrepresent the ACORN workers and present them in the worst possible light. The pair had set up the workers rather than doing investigative journalism. Investigations by the California AG, Brooklyn U.S. Attorney and the U.S. GAO found that ACORN workers had not participated in criminal activities.\n\nIn September 2009, before the investigations revealed the selective and heavy editing of the videos, Alexandra Fenwick of the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" described the video ensemble as a politically motivated piece that lacked context and did not present accurate information. She characterized the work as raw information instead of journalism. She said some elements of the ACORN videos seemed \"shadows of journalism's muckraking past\" and were commendable. The videos were criticized by MSNBC's Norah O'Donnell, who suggested the use of hidden cameras was a form of entrapment.\n\n\"Washington Post\" staff writers Darryl Fears and Carol D. Leonnig wrote: \nGiles and O'Keefe have been criticized for accuracy problems. Their videos include the oft-repeated conservative claim that ACORN is expected to get up to $8.5 billion in government funds. But that's a bold exaggeration, as it includes $3 billion in stimulus funds set aside for revitalization efforts nationwide, and $5.5 billion in federal community development grants.The more than $8 billion number was based on the false assumption that ACORN would apply for and win every project and grant in the country, and in fact ACORN did not apply for any of the stimulus funds. Leonnig also observed:the videos, in some cases, left out what I would call some exculpatory material ... for example, in one, a San Berna[r]dino employee at ACORN explains that there is no way ACORN would support what the couple were proposing, and she asks if they are putting her on, candid-camera style.During a September 14 television appearance on FOX, O'Keefe appeared dressed in a fur coat, sunglasses, and holding a cane. The host announced: \"[O'Keefe] is dressed exactly in the same outfit that he wore to these ACORN offices up and down the eastern seaboard.\" He asked, \"[I]s that what you think a pimp looks like?\" O'Keefe answered yes. Within weeks, political journalist Mike Stark revealed that O'Keefe did not wear such clothing to the ACORN offices, but rather he wore subdued clothing and a tie, and in one instance posed as a candidate for Congress. Stark said, \"If they really wanted the truth out there, why do they need to edit these tapes in the first place? Why aren't the unedited videos already in the public domain?\"\n\nThe Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes cleared ACORN employees in the local office of criminal wrongdoing on March 1, 2010, after a five-month investigation.

Its programming includes news and propaganda promoting Hamas, children's shows (such as \"Tomorrow's Pioneers\"), and religiously inspired entertainment. It is currently directed by Palestinian Legislative Council member Fathi Hamad.\n\nThe station began broadcasting in the Gaza Strip on January 9, 2006 after Hamas won a sweeping victory in Palestinian parliamentary elections. On January 22, 2006, the Palestinian public prosecutor Ahmed Maghni decided to close down a television station because it did not have the necessary broadcast license, but the decision was never enforced.\n\nOn December 29, 2008, during the Gaza War, Israeli aircraft repeatedly bombed the al-Aqsa television station headquarters in Gaza City. The building was completely destroyed, but the station continued to broadcast from a mobile TV unit\n\nOn July 29, 2014, during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, an Israeli air strike hit a media building housing al-Aqsa TV and al-Aqsa Radio channel in the centre of Gaza City early on in the morning. The television station continued to broadcast, but the radio station went silent. The radio station has since come back on the air.\n\nOn November 12, 2018, Israel bombed the station building after launching at least five non-exploding missiles nearby as warnings to evacuate followed a surge in cross-border fighting.\n\nIn May 2013, Al-Aqsa TV became the focus of media scrutiny after a decision by the Newseum to honor two Al-Aqsa TV members as part of its ongoing memorial to journalists who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2012. The U.S. government classifies Al-Aqsa TV as being controlled by Hamas, a \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist,\" and states that it \"will not distinguish between a business financed and controlled by a terrorist group, such as Al-Aqsa Television, and the terrorist group itself.\" \nAccording to the American Jewish organisation, the Anti-Defamation League, Al-Aqsa TV promotes terrorist activity and incites hatred of Jews and Israelis and much of its programming glorifying violence is geared towards children.\n\nIn regards to Al-Aqsa's television programme \"Tomorrow's Pioneers\", following complaints by Israeli watchdog groups that triggered international scrutiny, Palestinian Information Minister Mustafa Barghouti said he had asked Al-Aqsa TV to stop the broadcasts so the content could be reviewed. Despite Barghouti's call, \"Tomorrow's Pioneers\" went on the air as usual. In later episodes the co-host, a Mickey Mouse-like character named Farfour was killed by an Israeli interrogator, and was replaced by a bee named Naoul, who also died and was replaced by a rabbit character named Assoud. Assoud, in turn, was martyred and replaced by Nassur the bear.\n\nIn May 2008, Bassem Naeem, the minister of health in the Hamas government in Gaza, responded to allegations of antisemitism in Al-Aqsa TV programmes. In his letter to \"The Guardian\", Naeem stated that the Al-Aqsa Channel is an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Hamas government or the Hamas movement. In response, \"Guardian\" columnist Alan Johnson wrote that Al-Aqsa TV cannot be a media institution independent of Hamas, because it is headed by Fathi Hamad, chairman of a Hamas-run company that also produces the Hamas radio station and its bi-weekly newspaper, and because, since 2007, Hamas had blocked Palestinian National Authority broadcasts into Gaza, which indicated that there is no independent media in Gaza.\n\nAbout reporting, Ibrahim Daher, a director at Al-Aqsa media operation, said they may not broadcast certain news. He said “If there was bad news during the war, or something went wrong, we just kept silent about it” and “now we mostly keep silent about the blockade, and that Hamas wasn't able to lift it during the war”.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5899", "title": "Continuity (fiction)", "text": "Continuity (fiction)\n\nIn fiction, continuity is consistency of the characteristics of people, plot, objects, and places seen by the reader or viewer over some period of time. It is relevant to several media.\n\nContinuity is particularly a concern in the production of film and television due to the difficulty of rectifying an error in continuity after shooting has wrapped up. It also applies to other art forms, including novels, comics, and video games, though usually on a smaller scale. It also applies to fiction used by persons, corporations, and governments in the public eye.\n\nMost productions have a script supervisor on hand whose job is to pay attention to and attempt to maintain continuity across the chaotic and typically non-linear production shoot. This takes the form of a large amount of paperwork, photographs, and attention to and memory of large quantities of detail, some of which is sometimes assembled into the story bible for the production. It usually regards factors both within the scene and often even technical details including meticulous records of camera positioning and equipment settings. The use of a Polaroid camera was standard but has since been replaced by digital cameras. All of this is done so that, ideally, all related shots can match, despite perhaps parts being shot thousands of miles and several months apart. It is an inconspicuous job because if done perfectly, no one will ever notice.\nIn comic books, continuity has also come to mean a set of contiguous events, sometimes said to be \"set in the same universe.\"\n\nMost continuity errors are subtle and minor, such as changes in the level of drink in a character's glass or the length of a cigarette, and can be permitted with relative indifference even to the final cut. Others can be more noticeable, such as sudden drastic changes in appearance of a character. Such errors in continuity can ruin the illusion of realism and affect suspension of disbelief.\n\nIn cinema, special attention must be paid to continuity because films are rarely shot in the order in which they are presented. The shooting schedule is often dictated by location permit issues. For example, a character may return to Times Square in New York City several times throughout a movie, but as it is extraordinarily expensive to close off Times Square, those scenes will likely be filmed all at once to reduce permit costs. Weather, the ambience of natural light, cast and crew availability, or any number of other circumstances can also influence a shooting schedule.\n\nFilm production companies use various techniques to prevent continuity errors. First would be to film all the shots for a particular scene together, and all shots of consecutive scenes together (if the scenes take place together, with no break between them in the film's timeline). This allows actors to remain in costume, in character, and in the same location (and with the same weather, if shooting on location).\n\nThe second major technique is for costume designers, production designers, prop masters, and make-up artists to take instant photographs of actors and sets at the beginning and end of each day's shooting (once made possible by Polaroid cameras, now done with digital cameras and cell phones as well). This allows the various workers to check each day's clothing, set, props, and make-up against a previous day's.\n\nThe third is to avoid shooting on location entirely, but instead film everything on a studio set. This allows weather and lighting to be controlled (as the shooting is indoors), and for all clothing and sets to be stored in one place to be hauled out the next day from a secure location.\n\nEditing errors can occur when a character in a scene references a scene or incident that has not occurred yet, or of which they should not yet be aware.\n\nAn example of an editing error can be seen in the film \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963), where a scene of people climbing a slope at the start is seen from below and then replayed from above.\n\nVisual errors are instant \"discontinuities\" occurring in visual media such as film and television. Items of clothing change colors, shadows get longer or shorter, items within a scene change place or disappear, etc.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of a \"visual error\" appears in Charlie Chaplin's 1914 movie \"The Property Man\". Here, in a supposedly smooth step from one room to another, the Tramp loses his hat in one room, but it is instantly back on his head as he enters the next room. Rather \"loose\" plots and a lack of continuity editing made most early films rife with such errors.\n\nAnother example occurs in the 1998 film \"Waking Ned\", when two of the film's characters, Jackie and Michael, are walking through a storm towards Ned's house. The umbrella they are under is black during their conversation as they walk towards the house (filmed from slightly above and to the front), yet after cutting to a lower shot (filmed from behind Jackie), Michael walks onscreen from the right holding an umbrella that is not black but beige, with a brown band at the rim.\n\nYet another glaring example of poor continuity occurs in the Disney film \"Pete’s Dragon\" (filmed in 1976). During the song \"Brazzle Dazzle Day\" when Lampie (Mickey Rooney), Pete (Sean Marshall), and Nora (Helen Reddy) climb the stairs to the top of the lighthouse, Pete's shirt beneath his overalls is orange. But after descending to the bottom again and coming out of the lighthouse door, his shirt is now grey.\n\nThough visual continuity errors are logically confined to visual media, parallel mistakes can occur in text. In \"The Miller's Tale\" in Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\", a door is ripped off its hinges only to be slowly closed again in the next scene.\n\nA plot error, or a plot hole as it's commonly known, reflects a failure in the consistency of the created fictional world. A character might state he was an only child, yet later mention a sibling. In the TV show \"Cheers\", Frasier Crane's wife Lilith mentions Frasier's parents are both dead. When the character was spun off into \"Frasier\", his father became a central character with, in a case of retroactive continuity, the explanation that Frasier was embarrassed about his father's lowbrow attitudes and thus claimed his death. This is a frequent occurrence in sitcoms, where networks may agree to continue a show, but only if a certain character is emphasized, leading other minor characters to written out of the show with no further mention of the character's existence, while the emphasized character (usually a breakout character, as in the case of Frasier Crane) develops a more complete back story that ignores previous, more simplified back stories.\n\nA Homeric nod (sometimes heard as 'Even Homer nods') is a continuity error. It has its origins in Homeric epic.\n\nThe proverbial phrase for it was coined by the Roman poet Horace in his \"Ars poetica\":\n\n\"... et idem\" \"indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus\"\n\n... and yet I also become annoyed whenever the great Homer nods off.\n\nThere are numerous continuity errors in Homer that resemble \"nods\", as for example:\n\n\nIn modern Homeric scholarship many of Homer's \"nods\" are explicable as the consequences of the poem being retold and improvised by generations of oral poets. So in the second case cited above, it is likely that two different versions are being conflated: one version with an embassy of three people, another with just two people.\n\nAlexander Pope was inclined to give Homeric nods the benefit of the doubt:\n\nThose oft are Stratagems which Errors seem,Nor is it Homer Nods, but We that Dream. - \"Essay on Criticism\" \n\nIn his online column, \"Best of The Web Today\", James Taranto of \"The Wall Street Journal\" often used the phrase \"Homer Nods\" as the title of a retraction or correction.\n\nThe practice of accelerating the age of a television character (usually a child or teenager) in conflict with the timeline of a series and/or the real-world progression of time is popularly known as Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome, or SORAS. Children unseen on screen for a time might reappear portrayed by an actor several years older than the original. Usually coinciding with a recast, this rapid aging is typically done to open up the character to a wider range of storylines, and to attract younger viewers. A recent example of this occurring is in the BBC's \"Merlin\" series, in which Mordred is initially played by a young child in Season 4, yet suddenly grows up into his late teens in time for the start of Season 5, with the rest of the characters aging by only three years.\n\nThe reverse can also happen. On \"Lost (TV Series)\", the character of 10-year-old Walt Lloyd was played by 12-year-old Malcolm David Kelley. The first few seasons took place over the course of just a few months, but by that point Lloyd looked much older than 10. In his remaining few appearances, special effects were used to make him look younger, or the scene took place years later.\n\nSometimes a work of fiction may deliberately employ continuity errors, usually for comedy. For example, the Marx Brothers' classic film \"Duck Soup\", at the climax of the film, the camera shows a shot of Groucho Marx speaking a line, followed by a shot of something else happening, followed by another shot of Groucho. Each time, Groucho's hat changes, usually to something more outrageous than before (a Napoleonic hat, a Prussian hat, etc.).\n\nWhen continuity mistakes have been made, explanations are often proposed by either writers or fans to smooth over discrepancies. Fans sometimes make up explanations for such errors that may or may not be integrated into canon; this has come to be colloquially known as \"fanwanking\" (a term originally coined by the author Craig Hinton to describe excessive use of continuity). Often when fans do not agree with one of the events in a story (such as the death of a favorite character), they will choose to ignore the event in question so that their enjoyment of the franchise is not diminished. When the holder of the intellectual property discards all existing continuity and starts from scratch it is known as rebooting. Fans call a less extreme literary technique that erases one episode the reset button. See also fanon.\n\nDiscrepancies in past continuity are sometimes made deliberately; this is known as retconning. Retcons are also sometimes used to either correct or cover up a perceived error. These changes may be made either by the same writer who made it, or more commonly by an author that has taken over the creative lead of a corporate owned show or publication. Not to be confused with the continuance of a reality (continuality).\n\nTelevision programs like \"24\", in which actors have to appear as if it is the same day for 24 consecutive episodes, have raised public recognition of continuity. However, traditional films have frequently had much of the same sort of the issues to deal with; film shoots may last several months and as scenes are frequently shot out of story sequence, footage shot weeks apart may be edited together as part of the same day's action in the completed film. In some ways, \"24\" presents a simpler situation, as costumes and hairstyles generally should \"not\" change very frequently; in many feature films a range of different hairstyles and costumes must be created, changed, and then recreated exactly, as various scenes are shot.\n\n"}

Seven of the siblings took up stage careers. In their earliest years, costumed by their mother (Matilda Mary Caroline), they performed as \"The Fairy Bells Minstrels\", singing temperance songs in local missions and church halls. This ceased when the eldest sister made her professional debut at the age of fifteen. The children were entranced by music hall, their father (John, an artificial florist) working in the evenings at the nearby Royal Eagle Tavern.\n\nDaisy made her own first professional appearance in a play entitled \"My Willie\" at the South London Palace, on 17 March 1890. She went on to perform a solo musical act, making the most of her petite and dainty figure. She was thought to have been the prettiest of the sisters.\n\nOn 26 April 1899 she married Donald Alexander Munro, an insurance broker and chairman of the Crown Theatre. She was only 21, and her husband 26, when she retired from the theatre. They had two children, Donald (1902) and Dorothy Grace (1906). They moved to Kensington, but Donald fell ill the following year, and their fortunes were under pressure.\n\nIn her late twenties, Daisy returned to the stage, and due to the increasing fame of her sisters, at the top of the bill.

{"id": "659324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=659324", "title": "Dramatic monologue", "text": "Dramatic monologue\n\nDramatic monologue, also known as a persona poem, is a type of poetry written in the form of a speech of an individual character. M.H. Abrams notes the following three features of the \"dramatic monologue\" as it applies to poetry:\n\nOne of the most important influences on the development of the dramatic monologue is romantic poetry. However, the long, personal lyrics typical of the Romantic period are not dramatic monologues, in the sense that they do not, for the most part, imply a concentrated narrative. Poems such as William Wordsworth's \"Tintern Abbey\" and Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"Mont Blanc\", to name two famous examples, offered a model of close psychological observation and philosophical or pseudo-philosophical inquiry described in a specific setting. The conversation poems of Samuel Taylor Coleridge are perhaps a better precedent. The genre was also developed by Felicia Hemans and Letitia Elizabeth Landon, beginning in the latter's case with her long poem \"The Improvisatrice\".\n\nThe novel and plays have also been important influences on the dramatic monologue, particularly as a means of characterization. Dramatic monologues are a way of expressing the views of a character and offering the audience greater insight into that character's feelings. Dramatic monologues can also be used in novels to tell stories, as in Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", and to implicate the audience in moral judgments, as in Albert Camus \"The Fall\" and Mohsin Hamid's \"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\".\n\nThe Victorian period represented the high point of the dramatic monologue in English poetry.\n\n\nOther Victorian poets also used the form. Dante Gabriel Rossetti wrote several, including \"Jenny\" and \"The Blessed Damozel\"; Christina Rossetti wrote a number, including \"The Convent Threshold.\" Augusta Webster's \"A Castaway,\" \"Circe\", and \"The Happiest Girl In The World\", Amy Levy's \"Xantippe\" and \"A Minor Poet,\" and Felicia Hemans's \"Arabella Stuart\" and \"Properzia Rossi\" are all exemplars of this technique. Algernon Charles Swinburne's \"Hymn to Proserpine\" has been called a dramatic monologue vaguely reminiscent of Browning's work. Some American poets have also written poems in the genre- famous examples include Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven and Sylvia Plath's Daddy.\n\nPost-Victorian examples include William Butler Yeats's \"The Gift of Harun al-Rashid\", Elizabeth Bishop's \"Crusoe in England\", and T.S. Eliot's \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" and \"Gerontion\".\n\n\n"}

Performances in front of members of the British Royal Family, including Queen Victoria at Sandringham, and the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and Princess Alexandra at Marlborough House, enabled him to use the name \"The Royal Conjuror\" in his publicity.\n\nEvans had a successful career of over fifty years from 1849, performing in theatres and music halls in London and the English provinces and at private functions. He was an inveterate collector who created a collection of around 5000 items of ephemera relating to popular Victorian entertainment and daily life that is now in the British Library as The Evanion Collection. The collection was purchased by the British Museum Library in 1895. He was acquainted with Harry Houdini who purchased a quantity of items related to magic and illusions from Evans in 1904. According to Houdini, Evans spent every spare hour at the British Museum collecting information about the history of magic.\n\nEvans died, impoverished, of cancer of the throat at Lambeth Infirmary on 17 June 1905. He was survived by his wife who died not long afterwards.\n\n\n\n"}

The circus and entertainment company was founded in 1993 by Gregangelo Herrera, a whirling dervish, aerial arts choreographer and drummer. The company’s signature performances incorporate multiculturalism, ensemble aerial acts, optical illusions and interactive play. Operating as one-out shows, the troupe and entertainment company create performances with a cast of local San Francisco and Bay Area artists, including several artists they have sponsored from around the world.\n\nFor twenty-five years, Velocity Circus has remained an independent company, without federal or private grants or program funding. Though an independent, entrepreneurial set up is unusual for most circus troupes, the troupe has experienced a range of financial and commercial success. Gregangelo’s Velocity Circus/Arts and Entertainment is commissioned by non-profits, festivals, museums, corporate events and tech startup events for its hour long shows and three hour immersive experiences.\n\nGregangelo’s Velocity Arts and Entertainment Company has created performances and installations, interalia, for Warner Bros., Microsoft, Lucasfilm, Lexus, Univision, Yelp, Cisco Systems, and Mercedes-Benz. For every show, performers double as crew members for Velocity Arts and Entertainment, tailor the costumes and pitch ideas. The arts and entertainment company supports the circus, providing all of the multi-media, motion media, music, costume, makeup, hair and wigs, technology, writing, scenic, lighting, special effects, installations, infrastructure, photography, painters, sculptors, makers, and any other in-house visual support and aesthetic supporting. The Gregangelo Museum serves as the companies headquarters.\n\nGregangelo Herrera was seventeen when he started his Saturday night show at the Pasha Club as a whirling dervish, drummer, and folkloric dancer. The supper club had a Moroccan fantasy aesthetic, and was a metropolitan spin on Sahara City, a small Middle Eastern circus in Cairo. Gregangelo Herrera developed the act in a direction that was more futuristic and modern than the traditional Dervish act he was hired to perform and was consequently fired three times. However, they rehired him three times as well. During this period in his adolescence, he trained in dance and developed his whirling dervish act with Amina Goodyear, a cultural dance and music teacher who owned Aswan Dancers. Susu Pampanin, one of the Aswan Dance teachers in drumming, locally produced the Cairo Cat performance, where Herrera performed as an ensemble drummer. The community performances gave Herrera exposure at a young age and was formative to his philosophy about money and art.\n\nAt the age of eighteen, Herrera declared an individualized major at California College of the Arts, which incorporated multimedia, textiles, cultural studies, videography, woodworking, and drawing. The major he created allowed him to produce shows later on. Paying for school as he attended, Herrera worked at a contemporary art gallery called Japonesque. He also traveled to the remote areas in the Middle East with school grant money and earned credits for cultural studies while he continued to develop his solo career.\n\nGregangelo Herrera was training at the San Francisco School of Circus Arts (Circus Center) to develop his aerial arts skills when he met Zeina Asfour, another circus performer of Lebanese descent. While training together, surrounding circus performers began to collaborate with Herrera, gaining an interest in his artist for-profit mentality. Herrera began choreographing circus acts that employed a Middle Eastern sensibility while incorporating aspects of astrophysics. Herrera provides in many of his interviews and through his museum tours that he attempts to reveal how momentum, velocity and the natural elements interplay in the circus field. For example, he still employs the laws of physics into the themes and titles of his choreographed performances.\n\nHerrera became aware of the Big Bang theory in the 1990s; in 1992 scientists witnessed through a telescope what they thought was a universe coming into existence. Obsessed with the Big Bang theory, Herrera wanted a company name that described the force of everything that exists in the universe. Thus, Herrera thought the equation for velocity (velocity equals distance over time) fit the kinetic nature of circus arts, performance arts, and the arts in general. Finding that art comes into existence through movement is very characteristic of the traditional Whirling Dervish philosophy.\n\nWith an early start at the Circus Center, Herrera produced multiple aerial acts. During the Neptune Act, aerial artists performed in pitch black lighting, wearing UV reactive costuming. Appearing on the apparatus at abnormal times gave viewers the idea that the performers were appearing and disappearing. Herrera would continue to employ this multimedia technique throughout other shows.\n\nVelocity Circus Arts and Entertainment company’s global and continental exposure increased after the show Heliosphere went on tour to county festivals around the United States as a for-hire circus troupe. Paul Del Bene co-wrote the show, which attempted to look at the solar system and beyond the solar system, and was composed of stand alone acts based in astrophysics, such as a double contortion act called Eclipse, a fire act called Solar, and the whirling dervish act called Vortex. Encapsulating the company's arabic and physics based aesthetic, the show attracted regional and national festivals and theaters. Though it started as a show geared towards adult viewers for its revealing costumes, mature humor and concepts, Velocity Circus was commissioned to tighten up Heliosphere for a family audience.\n\nHeliosphere Jr. was created as an adaptation to the original Heliosphere featuring the same interactive and immersive tactics. Another purpose of the acts were to introduce world culture all over the United States, in an effort to bring San Francisco multiculturalism to small towns in middle America. The show was assembled with the goal of engaging youth while serving as an educational platform, though they have no formal educators in training, the Legion of Honor has employed the circus troupe many times to continue performances that double as educational platforms.\n\nHeliopolis was commissioned for the Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs exhibition at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. The production attempted to provide a panorama of Egyptian history, mythology, folklore and fantasy. The performance featured hypnotic hand dances, hoops of fire, contortionists, aerialists, and snake charmers. The cast included 20 artists.\n\nVelocity Circus’ India show at Fa Femina Miss India Pageant adopted some of the acts from Heliosphere while incorporating new acts that featured an Indian inspired dance act, a Persian fire act, and an Egyptian whirling dervish act. The performance in Hyderabad, India, attracted Velocity Circus' largest television audience to date.\n\nThe Illuminated Garden was commissioned by tech companies and took place in a park in Palo Alto, California. The performance followed the arc of the day, starting at noon and ending at midnight. The show was an interactive performance where the audience became the characters in the show, flying on the trapeze, climbing and crawling through interactive installations and investigating the world through a circus experience. Audience members’ faces were projected onto a 16-foot tall video sculpture titled the PyramID. Velocity Circus scheduled a brief break for dinner, during which, the garden became illuminated in glow-in-the-dark LED lights. Audience members wore 3D glasses and walked through a 3-dimensional labyrinth, wading through grass reeds and flowers as floating aerial artists swung overhead in lit-up orbs.\n\nIn a rebranding campaign, Mercedes-Benz and Univision commissioned Herrera to recreate their logos by using aerial artists to hang suspended in mid-air.\nGregangelo Herrera has collaborated with some of his would be competitors, but Velocity Circus is still not completely competitor free. The circus arts have been popular in San Francisco, and long time standing circus arts organizations like Acrosports and the San Francisco Circus Center, that were once collaborators now compete for show bookings.\n\nOther close relatives of the circus arts compete for commissions and have similar platforms to Velocity Circus. Vau de Vire Society is a San Francisco born company that features burlesque aesthetics, musicians that double as circus performers, and provocative music. As Velocity Circus has honed in its skills to appeal to younger audiences and family events for example the kid's section at the Parade of Tall Ships, Vau de Vire is just one of the circus troupes that appeals to adult life that is booming in San Francisco. The circus can be very sexual in many respects, and Velocity Circus shows employ mature jokes that seem harmless on the surface, using rhetoric like \"deflowering\" and \"seeds\" at county festivals where the towns are known for their produce.\n\nA circus troupe in Pennsylvania, Double Blind Productions, has very similar concepts as Velocity Circus, including a narrative show much like Velocity Circus' shows, called Escape Velocity. The troupe is self proclaimed comedians, artisans, Ariel artists and musicians.\n\nKinetic Arts Center is a Bay Area based circus troupe that also offers classes to the general public and competes with Velocity Circus in marketing their shows.\n\nHerrera himself believes in collaboration, and avidly makes a point on his CCA alumnus page about the benefits of artistic collaboration especially as funding for the arts decline in today's political atmosphere. Some of Herrera's collaborators are Trapeze Arts Incorporated, Earth Circus and Trapeze World.\n\nIn 2015, Velocity Circus had a problem with their generator and an ice rink show had to be cancelled. Since then Lighting of the Embarcadero Ice Rink has only used Disney on Ice.\n"}

He is most famous for commercials for Nestlé chocolate featuring Farfel the Dog. He also hosted a children's show sponsored by Nestlé.\n\nJimmy Nelson was born in Chicago, Illinois on December 15, 1928. When he was ten years old, his aunt won a toy ventriloquist's dummy named \"Dummy Dan\" in a Bingo game and gave it to her nephew for Christmas. He learned ventriloquism, and a year later, his father upgraded the dummy's mouth control from a simple string-and-loop to a lever-system like those used in professional ventriloquist's dummies.\n\nNelson began taking \"Dan\" to school, where his fourth-grade teacher allowed him to use the dummy when speaking in front of the class. In this way, Nelson taught himself to overcome his fear of public speaking. He soon started using jokes in his presentation, discovering he could make his classmates laugh.\n\nHe then started performing for church groups, schools and American Legion posts. By the time he was a teenager, he started earning money competing in amateur talent contests held at the local movie theatres, where the prize was five dollars for the most popular act.\n\nIn 1945, Nelson asked famed Chicago ventriloquist figure maker Frank Marshall to make him a professional-quality dummy. Marshall, who had made Edgar Bergen's \"Charlie McCarthy\" and Paul Winchell's \"Jerry Mahoney\", would only do this after seeing the ventriloquist's work. He came to one of Nelson's theatre performances and was impressed, so sold Nelson a custom-made dummy, which he always carved to bear a resemblance to the ventriloquist.\n\nNelson gave Dummy Dan's replacement the full name \"Danny O'Day\", which he chose because it contained none of the consonants impossible for ventriloquists to say without moving the lips, unlike \"McCarthy\" and \"Mahoney\". He then hired a manager and started touring professionally.\n\nBy 1947, Nelson was a professional success and Danny O'Day began to show signs of wear, so Nelson hired Marshall to build him a second one. However, Marshall's hand-carved originals (which he tailored to the personality of the ventriloquist) were impossible to duplicate identically, and Nelson felt the second dummy didn't look sufficiently like Danny to replace him. So he decided to maintain Danny, and added heavy eyebrows, eyeglasses and a beret to the new dummy, creating a foil for Danny named \"Humphrey Higsbye\".\n\nIn September 1950, Nelson made his first appearance with Danny on The Ed Sullivan Show.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Jimmy Nelson released two LP records, One being \"Pinocchio\", which involved his four major dummies, which was released on Cricket Records in 1959, and the other being \"Jokes and Riddles\", which was done before a live audience of children, released on Rocking Horse Records.\n\nOne night that year, while working a late show in a Wichita, Kansas nightclub, he picked up a stuffed dog a patron had left on the piano, and improvised a low-pitched voice to make it talk. This gave him the idea for a new character which he had Marshall build. He named it Farfel, after the Jewish pasta dish he had seen on the menu of the Borscht Belt resorts in upstate New York where he performed. His famous line was : \"No, I wouldn't say that\"\n\nIn 1950, Nelson was hired as a regular on the Texaco Star Theatre TV show hosted by Milton Berle. Nelson and Danny O'Day would appear in Texaco gas jockey uniforms.\n\nAt one point, he added another animal dummy to his character repertoire, a cat named Ftatateeta after a character in George Bernard Shaw's play \"Caesar and Cleopatra\". The cat's voice was based on Ed Wynn's. In 1954, Nelson served as emcee on the game shows \"Bank on the Stars\" and \"Come Closer\".\n\nIn 1955, the Nestlé company hired Nelson to do commercials selling their chocolate candy and Nestlé's Quik chocolate milk flavoring. The Nestlé executives had him audition by spontaneously performing their newly written jingle. Nelson sang the first two (musical) lines in Danny's voice:\nHe finished with Farfel slowly singing the last word \"chocolate\", in two syllables. Nelson was so nervous that his hands sweated, and when Farfel was finished, his finger slipped off the control, causing the mouth to audibly snap shut, a mistake no ventriloquist should make. Nelson left the audition thinking he had blown it, but was surprised to learn he was hired; in fact, the executives actually liked the mouth-snapping effect and asked that he keep it. This became his trademark as the commercials ran for ten years.\n\nWhen advertising Nestlé's Quik, Danny O'Day would say it \"makes milk taste...like a \"million\"\" (dollars), again slowly and pausing for effect.\n\nIn 2009 Nelson was featured in the ventriloquist comedy documentary \"I'm No Dummy\", directed by Bryan W. Simon.\n\nNelson and his wife Betty have been residents of Cape Coral, Florida since the 1960s. He appeared with Danny and Farfel at local schools and was a long time spokesperson for First Federal Savings and Loan of Fort Myers.\n\nNelson was dubbed \"The Dean of American Ventriloquists\" in 2011.\n\nNelson collaborated in 2011 with maker of professional ventriloquist figures Tim Selberg to produce a character that pays homage to his Danny O'Day.\n\nNelson and Margot's three children were twins Larry and Lee, and a third son Jerry. They lived for many years in Forest Hills, NY and later in Jamaica, NY.\n\n"}

Originating in Moscow and then Paris, and directed by Nikita Balieff, the revue toured the United States, Europe, and South Africa. The show consisted of songs, dances, and sketches, most of which had been originally performed in Russia. The revue was enormously successful in the U.S., and one of its legacies is the popularization of the jaunty tune \"The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\" by Leon Jessel.\n\nIn 1906, Armenian actor Nikita Balieff moved to Moscow, and took a job at the Moscow Art Theatre under Constantin Stanislavski. After years of only non-speaking roles, and with a desire to perform comedy rather than drama, Balieff, along with theatre devotee Nikolai Tarasov, co-created his own theatre group in a basement near the Moscow Art Theatre. He named the cabaret and troupe \"The Bat\", after a well-known cabaret in Vienna called \"Fledermaus\". \n\n\"The Bat\" enjoyed much success and popularity in Moscow, until the Russian Revolution in 1917. Balieff then went into exile in western Europe, and began presenting vaudeville shows there with other Russian émigrés. \"La Chauve-Souris\" opened in Paris in December 1920. The spectacle was noticed by the British theatrical producer Charles B. Cochran, who brought Balieff and his troupe and show to London.\n\nIn 1922 \"La Chauve-Souris\" made its first tour to America, through an arrangement with the producer Morris Gest. \"La Chauve Souris\" performed on Broadway from February 1922 to June 1922 (153 performances) and January 1925 to March 1925 (61 performances) in productions produced by F. Ray Comstock and Morris Gest. Balieff and his company also toured from Washington, D.C. to California for 65 consecutive weeks. \n\nBetween 1922 and 1929, Balieff returned to America to tour six times, appearing on Broadway in 1922, 1923, 1925, 1927, and 1929, with one final show billed as \"New Chauve-Souris\" in 1931. In 1927 Balieff was featured on the cover of \"Time\" magazine.\n\nThe shows consisted of songs, dances, and sketches, most of which had been originally performed in Russia. Balieff, as master of ceremonies for the show, was known for his feigned lack of English on stage. His monologues and introductions were delivered in a mix of Russian, French, and English language and slang coupled with much gesticulation. However, in private Balieff's English was better than that of his stage persona.\nOne of \"La Chauve-Souris\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s most popular acts, \"The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\", which used the delightful Leon Jessel tune \"Die Parade der Zinnsoldaten\" (\"The Parade of the Tin Soldiers\"), referenced a story regarding Tsar Paul I. The legend claims the Tsar left his parade grounds without issuing a \"halt\" order to the marching soldiers. Without one, the soldiers marched to Siberia before being remembered and ordered back. The Balieff vaudeville version with its popular tune was a mainstay in \"Chauve-Souris\", and later became part of The Rockettes repertoire as well in their Radio City Christmas Spectacular. The \"Chauve-Souris\" \"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\" was also filmed, and premiered on April 15, 1923 at the Rivoli Theater. \n\n\"La Chauve-Souris\" also toured Europe and South Africa, appearing in major capital cities. \n\nIn 1934 Balieff created a new \"Chauve-Souris\" production, which proved to be his last theatrical venture.\n\nSeveral recordings were made of \"Sauve-Chouris\" numbers.\n\nPart of the \"La Chauve-Souris\" revue was recorded by British Columbia Graphophone Company, AX 2717, 2719 - 9220, speed 80 rpm, under the title \"Chauves Souris\":\n\nLee DeForest filmed \"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\" (to the music \"Die Parade der Zinnsoldaten\" by Leon Jessel), a popular segment from the stage production performed by Nikita Balieff and \"La Chauve-Souris\", in DeForest's Phonofilm sound-on film process. \n\nThe short film premiered 15 April 1923 as part of a program of 18 Phonofilms at the Rivoli Theater in New York City, and then in England, Japan, and Australia. The film, shown under the title \"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\" with two-color Technicolor sequences, is now in the Maurice Zouary collection of the Library of Congress.\n\n\"La Chauve-Souris\" inspired a parody called \"No Sirree!\" (subtitled \"An Anonymous Entertainment by the Vicious Circle of the Hotel Algonquin\"), written and performed by Robert Benchley and other members of the Algonquin Round Table for one night only in April 1922.\n\n\"No Sirree!\" had its genesis at the studio of Neysa McMein, which served as something of a salon for Round Tablers away from the Algonquin Hotel. Acts included: \"Opening Chorus\" featuring Alexander Woollcott, John Peter Toohey, George S. Kaufman, Marc Connelly, Franklin P.

{"id": "726178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=726178", "title": "Naked Came the Stranger", "text": "Naked Came the Stranger\n\nNaked Came the Stranger is a 1969 novel written as a literary hoax poking fun at the American literary culture of its time. Though credited to \"Penelope Ashe,\" it was in fact written by a group of twenty-four journalists led by \"Newsday\" columnist Mike McGrady.\n\nMcGrady's intention was to write a book that was both deliberately terrible and contained a lot of descriptions of sex, to illustrate the point that popular American literary culture had become mindlessly vulgar. The book fulfilled the authors' expectations and became a bestseller in 1969; they revealed the hoax later that year, further spurring the book's popularity.\n\nMike McGrady was convinced that popular American literary culture had become so base—with the best-seller lists dominated by the likes of Harold Robbins and Jacqueline Susann—that any book could succeed if enough sex was thrown in. To test his theory, in 1966 McGrady recruited a team of \"Newsday\" colleagues (according to Andreas Schroder, nineteen men and five women) to collaborate on a sexually explicit novel with no literary or social value whatsoever. McGrady co-edited the project with his \"Newsday\" colleague Harvey Aronson, and among the other collaborators were well-known writers including 1965 Pulitzer Prize winner Gene Goltz, 1970 Pulitzer Prize winner Robert W. Greene, and journalist Marilyn Berger. \n\nThe group wrote the book as a deliberately inconsistent hodge-podge, with each chapter written by a different author. Some of the chapters had to be heavily edited, because they were originally too well written. The book was submitted for publication under the pseudonym \"Penelope Ashe\". (She was portrayed by Billie Young, McGrady's own sister-in-law, for photographs and meetings with publishers.)\n\nThe publisher, Lyle Stuart, was an independent publisher then known for controversial books, many with sexual content. According to Stuart, he had appropriated the cover photo (a kneeling nude woman with very long hair down her back, photographed from behind) from a Hungarian nudist magazine; the model and photographer later demanded and received payment.\n\nGillian and William Blake are the hosts of a popular New York City breakfast radio chat show, \"The Billy & Gilly Show\", where they play the perfect couple. When Gillian finds out that her husband is having an affair, she decides to cheat on him with a variety of men from their Long Island neighborhood. Most of the book is taken up by vignettes describing Gilly's adventures with a variety of men, from a progressive rabbi to a mobster.\n\nThe book fulfilled McGrady's cynical expectations, and sales soon reached 20,000 copies, whereupon the co-authors decided to go public, in August 1969. The male authors gave their confession on \"The David Frost Show\", after being introduced as \"Penelope Ashe\" and walking out on stage, single file, as the orchestra played the song \"A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody\". The revelation of the true origins of the book prompted more sales with the book selling approximately 90,000 copies by 13 October 1969. By the end of the year, the book had spent 13 weeks on the \"New York Times\" Best-Seller List, although by that time its authorship was common knowledge. It is unclear how much of the book's success was due to its content and how much to publicity about its unusual origin. As of May 2012, the book's publisher reported the book had sold 400,000 copies.\n\nIn 1970, McGrady published \"Stranger Than Naked, or How to Write Dirty Books for Fun and Profit\", which told the story of the hoax.\"Naked Came the Stranger\" later became the basis for an adult film of the same title in 1975 directed by Radley Metzger and starring Darby Lloyd Rains. As reported by \"The Washington Post\", \"Mr. McGrady and the other writers had nothing to do with a hardcore 1975 film with the same title. They did, however, see the movie at a Times Square theater. During one vivid scene, Aronson told \"The Charlotte Observer\", someone shouted 'Author, Author!' 'Seventeen of us stood up.\n\n\n\n"}

Men were later admitted to the organization, and have been an important and enriching addition.\n\nThe National Career Awards Competition, organized by the NSAL is held each year in one of the following categories: visual arts, dance, drama, literature, music or musical theater. Participants in the National Career Awards Competition compete at the local chapter level for a series of monetary awards. First-place winners of the Local Chapter Competitions are sent to the NSAL National Competition, which is held each spring during the Society’s annual meeting. Participants in the National Competition compete for a first place award of $15,000, and a series of other awards that can total another $10,000 or more.\n\nThe competitions are designed to offer exposure for young artists who want to be heard and seen by professional critics, managers, producers, teachers, the media, and patrons of the arts.\n\nDuring its history, the competitions organized by the NSAL have benefitted Oscar-winning actress and dancer Shirley MacLaine and international opera star Jessye Norman among others. In 1998, non-citizens were permitted full membership privileges, thereby extending a more inviting, inclusive image to the organization.\n\nAll competitions are adjudicated by nationally recognized men and women in the arts. A master class is conducted by judges for the National Career Awards Competitions. Opportunities for one-on-one sessions and individual critiques are also encouraged.\n\nBegun by a group of civic-minded women who wanted to encourage young talent in the arts, the National Society of Arts and Letters determined from its inception that the best way to accomplish that goal was to sponsor competitions and offer scholarships in the categories of art, music and literature.\n\nOn October 21, 1944, they met at the home of the future first National President, Mollie Davis Nicholson, to found a group that specified it was non-partisan, non-political and non-profit-making. The Chevy Chase, Maryland Chapter was organized that year and became the Washington, D.C. Chapter on March 31, 1945, with Dorothy Nicholson Bates Stabell as its first president and founder.\n\nA second chapter, the Chicago Chapter, was started by Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, also in October 1944. In 1945, both chapters awarded scholarships: one in piano, three in voice (Washington) and one in pipe organ (Chicago).\n\nOn June 30, 1945, the first national conference of the National Society of Arts and Letters was held in Chicago. By this time, eight chapters had been formed: Washington, D.C., Chicago, Florida, Colorado, North Dakota, California, Texas and Kentucky. The bylaws provided membership to women qualified in the arts who were U.S. citizens. Artist member Emma W. Slack designed the insignia. Young artists were to be encouraged by receipt of donor gifts, chapter prizes, scholarships and exhibitions of their work or talent arranged by a chapter.\n\nBy 1946 four more chapters had started: Arkansas, Indiana, Ohio and New Jersey. A convention was held in Washington, D.C., between April 15–16 of that year, at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. American First Lady Bess Truman, initiated the festivities with a reception at the White House.\n\nAs growth continued, Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, the second National President, introduced and edited the newsletter. It was planned to issue it three times a year. A Certificate of Incorporation, was issued July 29, 1949 and tax-exempt status, was recorded November 7, 1949. By 1949 both dance and drama categories had been added to the competitions. By 1951, 25 chapters had been started.\n\nIn October 1994 members gathered together for a gala celebration of the Societies' 50th anniversary. The Central Illinois Chapter hosted the 60th Anniversary celebration in 2005 with performances by former contestants from 1959-2002. There was also a video featuring Dorothy Nicholson Stabell, daughter of one of the founders.\n\nToday there are 20 NSAL Chapters in 17 states.\n\nPart of the National competitions are the master classes conducted by judges in each art category. One-on-one sessions are also offered and encouraging critiques of each contestant are provided by the judges.\n\nThe National Society of Arts and Letters classifies the arts into six different categories: Art, Dance, Drama, Literature, Music and Musical Theatre; various sub-categories exist within each category. The annual National Competitions rotate among these six categories with the particular sub-category selected by the membership.\n\nMaster classes have been conducted in all the arts categories beginning in 2000. They have been conducted for NSAL by their judges and guest teachers including:\n\nSince the first national competition in 1951, NSAL has presented more than 4,000 awards to young artists. Chapter competitions are usually held in various artistic categories including the one special category specified for the National Competition for that year; only the first-place winners from the chapter competitions in this category advance to the National Competition.\n\nEarly on in the history of NSAL, the Nicholson/Nielsen Trust Fund was established to provide permanent support for awards to be given annually to ranking finalists in the National Career Award Competition. The principal of the Fund remains intact while the income is used to provide awards each year in one of the six rotating art categories which NSAL highlights in its National Competition.\n\nIndividuals and corporations may also endow a named award by contributing to the Fund. Current awards available from tax-exempt gifts to this Fund totaling $10,000 or more include:\n\nNSAL First Place Award of $10,000 or more is in memory of Mollie Davis Nicholson and Francesca Falk Miller Nielson, founders of the Society. The Estelle Campbell Award is presented to the second-place winner. The Mary Peery Fife Memorial Award is given in the category of Dance. The Catherine A. M. Cavanaugh Award is given in the Literature Category. Other awards include the Dorothy and Bruce Strong Award and the Mollie Davis Nicholson Award\n\nA second important activity of NSAL is the annual Winston Scholarship Program for visual artists and vocalists. Each year, scholarships totaling $18,000 - $20,000 are awarded to artists in these fields who are sixteen to twenty-two years of age. Supported by an endowment from Shirley Rabb Winston, these scholarships are used for special study in the recipient’s field.\n\nNotable recipients of NSAL awards have included Malcolm Frager (pianist), Shirley MacLaine (actor), Jessye Norman (opera singer; winner of a NSAL contest), Menahem Pressler (Gold Medal of Merit from the National Society of Arts and Letters), George Balanchine (1980 Gold Medal of Merit recipient\n"}

The NPS, however, does not have any members. It was created on April 28, 1994, following a split-up of the responsibilities of the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS). The NPS took over the NOS's culture, information, minorities and youth programming, allowing the NOS to concentrate on its role of providing impartial news coverage. On September 1, 2010, the NPS merged with Teleac and RVU into NTR.\nIn the summer of 2005, Jan Peter Balkenende's second cabinet presented plans to renovate the broadcasting system, including abolition of the NPS by 2007. The proposal was met with fierce resistance from many viewers and listeners, given the dedicated and fairly sizeable audience for the NPS's output. The idea was that other broadcasters would take over the type of programming that the NPS had previously provided. \n\nThere was little confidence among viewers, however, that this would actually happen. It was speculated at the time that the real motive for the proposed abolition was that the governing parties (Christian Democrat and liberal conservative) saw the foundation's output as being too left-wing.

{"id": "1999833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999833", "title": "Octane (Transformers)", "text": "Octane (Transformers)\n\nOctane is a fictional character in the various Transformers series in the Transformers franchise.\n\nOctane is the Decepticons' fueler, in charge of storing and distributing fuel among Decepticons with vehicle modes. He is characterized as a mean-spirited bully, cheater, and liar who takes delight in seeing others suffer. In jet mode, he is said to make other planes (even other Decepticons) crash-land for fun. Being one of the three Decepticon Triple Changers, Octane can transform between a robot mode and two other modes: a tanker truck and a Boeing 767 jet. After losing the rights to the original trademark many years after his introduction, Hasbro assigned the name Tankor to the character. He uses a rifle and tailfin-shield as weapons.\n\nIn the original Generation 1 cartoon, Octane only appeared in the third season. It is implied, however, that he existed in the Decepticon ranks during and even prior to \"\", though he is not seen in the feature. Octane first appears in \"Five Faces of Darkness Pt. 1\" where it is presumed that he is among the Decepticons exiled from Cybertron during the movie. His eventual alliance with Starscream, in which the two refer to each other as old friends, further implies Octane's status as having originally served under Megatron.\n\nIn the episode \"Thief in the Night\", Octane deserted the Decepticons and fled to the Socialist Democratic Federated Republic of Carbombya and there he discovered Trypticon. The city-sized Decepticon had been knocked into the ocean after his last battle with Metroplex. Repairing him, Octane used Trypticon as a bargaining chip, securing enough oil to convert to energon for himself, attacking Carbombya's enemies in return. When Trypticon's energon consumption spiraled out of control, Octane was forced to blow his cover by sending him to steal various world monuments to pacify Carbombya's dictator. This alerted Autobot leader Rodimus Prime, who was able to foil his scheme. Even more worryingly for Octane, it attracted the attention of his former leader Galvatron, who put a price on his head for his treachery.\n\nDuring his desertion, Octane collaborated with the Autobot Triple Changer Sandstorm to avoid getting captured. The two unlikely allies would end up dodging both Galvatron's troops and hired bounty hunters on Octane's trail. Sandstorm would help him escape to Cybertron.\n\nHis respite did not last long. In the episode \"Starscream's Ghost\", Octane fled into the Decepticon crypt, followed by Cyclonus, Scourge and the Sweeps. About to be caught and executed, the Triple Changer received help from an unlikely source — the vengeful ghost of Starscream, who had been killed by Galvatron in \"\". Possessing Cyclonus, Starscream allowed Octane to escape, and the two formed a scheme to eliminate Galvatron by tricking and abandoning him alone with Rodimus Prime, Ultra Magnus and several other Autobots. The scheme failed, as Galvatron successfully fought his way out of the trap and sent the duo fleeing once more. Octane does not appear in the follow-up episode also featuring the ghost of Starscream, \"Ghost in the Machine.\" He does make a background appearance in \"The Ultimate Weapon,\" but this may be an animation error (Blitzwing also makes an appearance in this episode, and both Decepticons had been exiled from the ranks by Galvatron for their treachery).\n\nAccording to officials who worked on the series, the storylines spotlighting Octane in the end of season three were originally written for Blitzwing. It was Blitzwing who was estranged from the Decepticons at the beginning of the third season, and Octane getting stuck in mid-transformation when meeting Starscream would have been more appropriate for Blitzwing, who is known to suffer from this problem. Hasbro requested that Octane be substituted for Blitzwing in the story because Octane was a newer toy that they wanted to promote. Later in the U.S. cartoon series, Octane became an Autobot, but he is seen to be a Decepticon again in the series.\n\nIn the Marvel U.S. Generation 1 series, Octane debuted along with Astrotrain and Blitzwing, serving as workers in Ratbat's new \"Wash'n'Roll\" project. Unfortunately, the spaceship that had brought the parts of Wash'n'Roll from Cybertron to Earth was infected by Scraplets. The infection spread to the Triple Changers and almost killed them, but Goldbug and his human friend Charlie Fong saved them along with the infected Autobots.\n\nAfter participating in the attack on the Autobots to recover captive Decepticons, Octane was amongst those Decepticons on the front-line of offensive against invaders believed to be the Autobots in the Arctic (in reality it was Scorponok's faction of Decepticons) and was present during the meeting between Ratbat and Scorponok. Octane was responsible for being the Decepticon that informed Ratbat, that Scorponok's troops were attacking their base caused by the secret of the Underbase being revealed in error. As he rushed into battle with the rest of his fellow warriors, Octane was seen to be attacking the Terrorcon Rippersnapper. After the battle, Octane was amongst those Decepticons carrying their fallen comrades back to the base to be repaired he was pushing the remains of Tantrum within a wheeled trolley. Then after the Autobots had attacked, he deactivated Mirage. Later, once the Underbase-powered Starscream had begun attacking the cities of Earth, Octane was deactivated by Starscream and was not seen again in the rest of the comics run. He did put in a further appearance in an alternate universe as part of Galvatron's forces in a nightmare alternate universe where Unicron had destroyed Cybertron, and Galvatron and the Decepticons ruled Earth.\n\nAlthough not explicitly identified as Octane, a dead Transformer with a similar appearance appears in issue 10 of the series amidst a pile of Decepticon corpses on the Warworld following a raid by a boarding party of 's troops, led by Starscream.\n\nOctane's first appearance in the Marvel U.K. comic was in the \"Target 2006\" story arc. He, along with the other Triple Changers, the three Insecticons, and Dirge, Thrust, Ramjet and Macabre, are the Decepticons' most feared killers and have to be taken out before a major Autobot uprising can take place. Megatron inadvertently scuppered the plan by summoning the Insecticons to Earth.\n\nOctane also appeared in issue #99, where he was a guard for Straxus, who had been reduced to a disembodied head after his battle with Blaster. Things changed when a teleportation mishap delivered both Megatron and Optimus Prime to Cybertron. Megatron quickly linked up with Straxus, and sent Octane to hunt down the escaped Prime while spreading misinformation that he was a failed Decepticon spy. When the Wreckers realized that it was the real Prime and teamed up with him, Octane delivered this news to Megatron and Straxus, exaggerating his own role in the events to curry favor with the Decepticon leaders.\n\nHe appeared again much later in the story \"Maneuvers.\" Octane was tired of constant work, stealing fuel for the Decepticons and wanted to have some fun by himself. To amuse himself, he chased the Autobot Jazz for miles who led Octane into a U.S. Army testing range, knowing full well he was full of fuel and would explode if hit. Octane called for help from his fellow Triple Changers, Blitzwing and Astrotrain, who managed to protect Octane for a while but were getting damaged themselves because of it. A forced confession from the terrified Octane to Blitzwing led to him and Astrotrain leaving Octane alone to deal with the Army. It is unclear whether this story is supposed to be set in the period where Ratbat was leading the Decepticons or the \"Earthforce\" stories surrounding it.\n\nIn the third crossover between G.I. Joe and the Transformers from Devil's Due Publishing, Octane appeared as part of the Decepticon air attack on the Autobot Capital City, led by Sixshot, but was driven off by Omega Supreme. He was one of the Decepticons that tried to stop Optimus Prime from attacking Serpentor, but was punched out by the Autobot leader.\n\nThe Triple Changers would appear again in Dreamwave's reinterpretation of the Generation One universe — this time with a greatly expanded origin. Octane originally appeared as part of Shockwave's assault force attacking Iacon, and would later join Starscream's Predacon faction during the period following the disappearance of Megatron.\n\nDuring the civil war on Cybertron, Shockwave envisioned a Transformer with multiple alternate modes, studying Astrotrain and Blitzwing. However, the Great Shutdown meant his plans could go no further — until Unicron's servant Scourge located Cybertron and reactivated Shockwave for study. Shockwave was attacked by Sharkticons, Scourge saved his life, only to be shot in the back by Shockwave. Shockwave then proceeded to examine and study Scourge, using the secrets gleaned to create first the Duocons and then the Triple Changers — Astrotrain, Blitzwing, Octane and at least two others — appearing to be the Autobots Sandstorm and Broadside. In the \"Micromasters\" mini-series by Dreamwave, Blitzwing and Astrotrain are suffering from severe physical changes. As this is before the Great Shutdown this might imply that the change was a natural one rather than a result of experiments.\n\nThe Triple-Changers later served as Shockwave's bodyguards, accompanying him to Earth to capture Optimus Prime and Megatron's troops. However, with the Earthbound Transformers captive, things began to go wrong. Grimlock had escaped and was intent on reactivating his fellow Dinobots. Shockwave sent Octane to investigate, but the Dinobots jumped him, beheaded him and stole his shuttle.\n\n\"Classicverse\" Octane appears among Megatron's troops in the story \"At Fight's End\" by Fun Publications. Although depicted as the new \"Tankor\" toy, he retains the Octane name in the story.\n\n\"Wings of Honor\" Octane appears in the Botcon 2013 story \"Machine Wars: Termination\". In this story he has his \"Universe\" Tankor body, but is still called Octane.\n\nAfter the Transformers license passed to IDW Publishing, Octane appeared as one of the Decepticons under Starscream's command in the alternate reality \"\" tale \"Hearts of Steel\". He was seen quizzing Tobias Muldoon about the possibilities of flight. He did not appear after this, but he was most likely destroyed when John Henry and Bumblebee diverted the Decepticon train convoy into a chasm.\n\nHe made his first appearance in the main G1 IDW continuity in issue #2 of \"\", where a series of video broadcasts showing underground gladiator battles (being watched by Ratbat) showed him battling alongside Slag and Megatron himself.\n\nIn the parallel universe television series \"\", Mega-Octane is portrayed as the cool, calculating leader of the Commandos. He is cruel and unfair, and uses his four subordinates as if they were his own limbs - he expects them to carry out his orders without question, and he has no tolerance with delays or mistakes. He is somewhat envious of Scourge, who snatched leadership of the Commandos directly from him. In missile trailer mode, Mega-Octane can launch missiles with a range of . In robot mode, he carries a laser rifle. He can also transform into a combat station and perform maintenance on his teammates. He forms the torso and head of Ruination.\n\nMega-Octane was one of five Transformers that actually began life as Autobots, sent to Earth along with a sixth to lead them in a mission to reactivate the legendary Autobot battle station known as Fortress Maximus. However, their craft malfunctioned and crashed, and the six Autobots were entombed in protoform state, joining Fortress Maximus in slumber until their ship was unearthed by Megatron and his Predacons. Absconding with the Autobot protoforms right under Optimus Prime's nose, Megatron took them to a nearby military base, intending to scan alternate modes for them. Mega-Octane was the first to be reactivated, infused with a portion of Megatron's own spark energy to create the first of a new breed of Transformer that Megatron dubbed the \"Decepticons.\" The other four members of the team followed, and eventually the sixth, Scourge, who took leadership of the team from Mega-Octane with a show of force.\n\nSimply referred to as the Commandos, they soon demonstrated their skills by blowing up dams across the country, debuting their combining abilities against Rail Racer and later attempting to harness the energies of a volcano on Montrose Island. As part of a string of failed attempts to locate the Autobots' hidden base, Movor was launched into orbit to track Side Burn from space, and the Decepticons then pretended to have reverted to their original Autobot selves in an effort to make the Autobots take them in. Later, Decepticon corruption of the Autobots' global spacebridge led Ruination into conflict with Landfill.\n\nIt soon became apparent that Scourge sought to overthrow Megatron's leadership, and the discovery of Fortress Maximus, buried beneath the Earth's surface accelerated the process as exposure to his energies, and those of the O-Parts - the keys to Maximus's resurrection - awoke memories of Scourge's original mission. His new Decepticon programming turned it on its head, however, as he now wished to command Maximus's power for his own, and soon had the other Decepticons thinking the same way, conspiring with Mega-Octane to get Cerebros, the power key of Fortress Maximus, under his control. As a series of chases to acquire control of Maximus began, Scourge eventually revealed his treachery by trying to have the giant attack Galvatron (Megatron, in a new form), only for the plan to fail. In retribution, Galvatron again brainwashed the Decepticons, turning them back into his loyal servants, who followed him so completely that they were even willing to take his orders after he attempted to kill them as a belated punishment. With Galvatron's defeat, the Decepticons and Predacons were all taken back to Cybertron for imprisonment.\n\nMega-Octane would make one further appearance in the BotCon 2004 voice actor play. Here, he was one of the Decepticons under the command of Reptilion, alongside Sunstorm and Perceptor. He battled Silverbolt, Rattrap and Waspinator in order to secure two groups of dimensionally displaced Autobots from the universe. However, the three groups of Autobots, together with a time-lost Autobot shuttle from the Great War, were able to defeat the Decepticons.\n\nAccording to Hasbro sources some proposed names for \"Cybertron\" Sky Shadow were Octane and Spacewarp.\n\nIn this incarnation, Octane is renamed Fuselage, a Decepticon from the brick-built world of \"Kre-O\" who turns into a cargo plane. Fuselage is an homage to the \"Generation 1\" Octane (particularly his Boeing 767 mode). His appearance in the comic is vastly different from that of his later Kreon toy, the comic renders him in a G1-faithful color scheme, sports a Ratchet helmet, and uses a Firestrike wing backpack.\n\nIn \"Treasure Competition! Defeat with Block Power!\", Fuselage was seen fleeing in terror along with his fellow Decepticons as Jazz attacked using a giant Mega-Jazz robot.\n"}

Several hundred women were registered as prostitutes with the National Health Service. \n\nAlthough illegal, brothels are set up in the more remote areas of Chile in ports, mining towns, logging areas or anywhere where there are men working away from home.\n\nThe promotion and facilitation (procuring and advertising) of prostitution is prohibited, as well as everything related to those under 18 (although the age of sexual consent for consensual and non-commercial acts for heterosexuals is 14 years). Until 1998 male homosexual prostitution was banned as sodomy was considered a crime in Article 365 of the Penal Code. \n\nThe same code in articles 373 and 495 sanctions \"offences to modesty, morals and good manners\", which is been applied to those who perform sexual acts in public of any nature, whether or not there is a commercial purpose. However, prostitution may be an aggravating factor of public order order, depending on the criteria of Carabineros. However, police often detain prostitutes (usually as a result of complaints by neighbourhood residents) on charges of \"offences against morality,\" which could lead to a 50,000 pesos fine or five days in prison. \n\nThe Sanitary Code refers to prostitution in Paragraph II of venereal diseases, which specifically prohibits brothels, but legitimises the existence of prostitution.\n\nChilean law requires sex workers to register with the Health Registry of the Ministry of Health (Minsal), and to undergo periodic medical. The Regulation on sexually transmitted infections and the Minsal's management and treatment guidelines includes specific sections on sex workers.\n\nSex workers have reported that law is frequently not enforced and there is corruption within the police.\n\nMost human trafficking victims are women and minors trafficked internally for sexual exploitation. Chilean women and girls respond to false job offers and subsequently are subjected to forced prostitution. Victims are also trafficked from the country to Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, the United States, Europe and Asia. Foreign women from Dominican Republic, Haiti, Ecuador, Colombia, and Paraguay, in addition to Asian countries such as China, are lured to Chile with fraudulent job offers and subsequently coerced into prostitution.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Chile as a 'Tier 1' country.\n\nInducing a minor (below age 18) to have sex in exchange for money or other favours is illegal. Punishment ranges from three to 20 years in prison and a 520,000 pesos fine depending on the age of the minor. A police sexual crimes brigade was specifically charged with investigating and prosecuting pedophilia and child pornography cases.\n\nIn 2003, the Government of Chile estimated that there were approximately 3,700 children involved in some form of commercial sexual exploitation; in 1999, UNICEF put the number of child prostitutes much higher, estimating that there were approximately 10,000 children between the ages of 6 and 18 involved in prostitution.\n\nArturo Herrera, the director of Chile’s PDI investigative police, resigned in 2009 following scandal in which police officers were deeply involved in a child prostitution ring. It was alleged that police took payment in the form of sex with drugged girls in return for protection of two brothels in Valparaiso run by Carlos Parra Ruis.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2421467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2421467", "title": "Radio Days", "text": "Radio Days\n\nRadio Days is a 1987 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Woody Allen, who also narrates. The film looks back on an American family's life during the Golden Age of Radio using both music and memories to tell the story. It stars an ensemble cast.\n\nJoe, the narrator, relates how two burglars got involved in a radio game after picking up the phone. He goes on to explain that he associates old radio songs with childhood memories. \n\nDuring the late 1930s and early 1940s young Joe lived in a modest Jewish-American family in Rockaway Beach. His mother always listened to \"Breakfast with Irene and Roger\". His father, who regularly gave him a beating, kept his occupation secret. Joe later found out that he was ashamed of being a taxi driver. Other family members were Uncle Abe and Aunt Ceil, grandpa and grandma, and Aunt Bea. The latter was a serial dater, always on the lookout for a potential husband. \n\nJoe's own favourite radio show was \"The Masked Avenger\". It made him dream of buying a secret decoder ring. In Joe's fantasy the Masked Avenger looked like a hero, but in reality the voice actor was short and bald. Other radio memories are stories about sporting heroes, news bulletins about World War II, a report of an extraterrestrial invasion, and a live report of the search for a little girl who fell into a well.\n\nWith his friends from school Joe was searching for German aircraft, but instead they saw a woman undressing in her bedroom. She later turned out to be their substitute teacher. Alone on the coast Joe saw a German U-boat, but he decided not to tell anyone because they wouldn't believe him.\n\nJoe was fascinated by the glitz and glamour of Manhattan, where the radio broadcasts were made. He visited the Radio City Music Hall, and described it as the most beautiful thing he ever saw. \n\nJoe collected stories of radio stars, including that of Sally White, whose dreams of becoming famous were hampered by her bad voice and accent. Starting as a cigar salesgirl she got stuck on the roof of the radio building with Roger, who was cheating on Irene. After she witnessed a crime the gangster Rocco wanted to kill her, but following his mother's advice he ended up using his connections to further her career. She finally became a reporter of celebrity gossip.\n\nOn New Year's Eve Joe was brought down from his room to celebrate the transition to 1944. Simultaneously the radio stars gathered on the roof of their building. The narrator concludes that he will never forget those radio voices, although with each passing of a New Year's Eve they seem to grow dimmer and dimmer.\n\nThe film's soundtrack, which features songs from the 1930s and 40s, plays an integral part in the plot. It was released on cassette and compact disc in 1987.\n\nThe film was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\"Radio Days\" was released on DVD by MGM November 6, 2001. A limited edition Blu-ray of 3,000 units was later released by Twilight Time\nJuly 8, 2014.\n\n\"Radio Days\" currently holds a \"Fresh\" 88% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.9/10. In his four-star review, noted critic Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" described \"Radio Days\" as Allen’s answer to Federico Fellini’s \"Amarcord\" and referred to it as \"so ambitious and so audacious that it almost defies description. It's a kaleidoscope of dozens of characters, settings and scenes - the most elaborate production Allen has ever made - and it's inexhaustible, spinning out one delight after another.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" referred to Allen as the \"prodigal cinema resource\" and spoke of the film saying, \"\"Radio Days\" [...] is as free in form as it is generous of spirit.\"\n\nDavid Denby wrote for \"New York\" that: \"[...] The real glue, however, is the lullingly beautiful popular music of the period — Cole Porter, Dubin and Warren, big-band jazz, crooners, torch singers, Carmen Miranda. The music, perfectly matched to images of old wood and brick buildings and old glamour spots, produces a mood of distanced, bittersweet nostalgia. \"Radio Days\" becomes a gently satiric commemorations of forgotten lives.\"\n\nIn a poll held by \"Empire\" magazine of the 500 greatest films ever made, \"Radio Days\" was voted number 304.\n\nAccording to his brother-in-law Jan Harlan, Stanley Kubrick loved \"Radio Days\" so much that he watched it \"twice within two days, because 'it was like watching a home movie,' he told me... He absolutely adored it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54273", "title": "Repertory theatre", "text": "Repertory theatre\n\nA repertory theatre (also called repertory, rep or stock) can be a Western theatre or opera production in which a resident company presents works from a specified repertoire, usually in alternation or rotation. In the British system, however, it used to be that even quite small towns would support a rep and the resident company would present a different play every week, either a revival from the full range of classics or, if given the chance, a new play, once the rights had been released after a West End or Broadway run. However the companies were not known for trying out untried new work. The methods, now seldom seen, would be also used in the United States, Canada, and Australia.\n\nThe acting company would usually consist of a leading lady, a leading man, a set of juveniles (one male and one female ingenue for the young often romantic role(s)), a character actor and actress (for the older or eccentric parts) and perhaps a vain and girlish soubrette. The company might occasionally bring in a guest star to increase interest, albeit in exchange for a cost increase often large enough to offset the rise in revenues brought by any increase in attendance. The resident cast would number seven, plus the resident director, usually serving as the artistic director in charge of the whole enterprise. Additionally there would be the stage director, the assistant stage manager (ASM), some unpaid apprentices and light and sound technicians. Newcomers to the profession would often start their careers in this fashion and members would gain a foundation upon which to base their future careers. Paid members could also be sure of a steady income for one or more seasons which might last for six months. Examples of performers who went on to universal recognition are Errol Flynn, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph Richardson, Lord Olivier, Jeremy Brett, Dame Judi Dench, Rosemary Harris, Sir Ian McKellen, Peter O'Toole, Christopher Plummer, Harold Pinter, Imelda Staunton, Lynn Redgrave, Arthur Lowe, Vanessa Redgrave, Sir Patrick Stewart, Geraldine McEwan and Ronnie Barker. Dirk Bogarde wrote about his start at tiny Amersham rep in 1939, and Sir Michael Caine recounts his time spent at Horsham rep in the early fifties.\n\nFor weekly rep and for a typical 3-act play, the actors' week would start on Tuesday and go as follows: Tuesday: notes on last night's opening from the director, then a sit-down read-through of the next play with some discussion by the director, on-the-feet blocking of the moves for Act I with a few questions from the actors and there are performances of last week's play each night. Wednesday: run Act I and start to block Act II, but break early because there's a matinée. Thursday: finish blocking Act II, run Act II and block Act III. Friday: run Act III, run through of entire play, no scripts in hand and technicals – meaning lights and sound – to watch and write down cues. Saturday: run through again, stop and go to test lighting and sound cues, costumes may be used if ready. Two shows today, the evening one closing the current play. After the show, the set is struck (taken down) by the crew - usually apprentices – and the stage manager.\n\nSunday is an opportunity to brush up on lines and moves and private rehearsals. But for the crew it means putting up the new sets, hanging and focusing lights and setting sound equipment. Monday: morning, run through, usually without costumes (save wear and tear), mainly for the techs. In the afternoon there's a \"Full Perfect\" dress rehearsal, maybe a few friends in front to gauge reaction, then copious notes. In the evening, 8 o'clock opening night, followed by notes from the director, visits with friends from the audience and maybe a party nearby. The process starts all over again on Tuesday.\n\nFrom the audience's point of view, local communities would become fans and champion their favourites who would be treated as celebrities. And sometimes entire families would make a visit to their local rep as part of the weekly routine like going to church, and for the young ones, it became a part of their future appreciation for live \"legitimate\" theatre.\n\nDuring the forties, fifties and sixties, two impresarios dominated the field of British rep, mostly in the North. They were Harry Hanson and his Court players, and Frank H. Fortescue's Famous Players, with Arthur Brough in Folkestone for the South. Their system was the toughest of all, for if you joined one of their companies, it could mean \"twice-nightly\" shows, and a new play to learn every week. Rosemary Harris tells of her 50 consecutive weeks of doing just that at Bedford rep. It cannot happen any more, due to the restrictions of British Equity which came to mandate just 8 shows a week, including perhaps two matinées. Fortescue, who died in 1957, was known to be a strict and upright man. When \"Pygmalion\" was playing at one of his theatres, because Eliza says \"Not bloody likely!\", \"FOR ADULTS ONLY!\" would be posted in the front of house. Or perhaps he was afraid of the Lord Chamberlain, Her Majesty's official censor whose duties were abolished in 1968.\n\nNot to be overlooked is a form of touring repertory theatre known as \"bus and truck\", which involves transporting the actors and sets for about five different plays which can be performed in smaller communities on consecutive nights.\n\nIn Russia and much of Eastern Europe repertory theatre is based on the idea that each company maintains a number of productions which are performed on a rotating basis. Each production’s life span is determined by its success with the audience. However, many productions remain in repertory for years as this approach presents each piece a few times in a given season, not enough to exhaust the potential audience pool. After the fall of the Soviet regime and the substantial diminution of government subsidy, the repertory practice has required re-examination. Moscow Art Theatre and Lev Dodin’s Maly Drama Theatre of St. Petersburg are the world’s most notable practitioners of this approach.\n\nIn German-speaking countries, most opera companies function in a similar way, too.\n\nToday in the UK, the practice of \"rep\" is more likely to be seen in large cities in the manner applied by such well-known established companies as Birmingham Rep in the Midlands of England which states in its programmes: \"\"\"The REP\" presents a season with each play generally having an unbroken run of between three and six weeks. This is the form of repertory theatre that the majority of theatres like The REP — which are also called producing theatres — now follow.\"\" Actors have the luxury of at least 3 weeks of rehearsal, and audiences see better shows. Repertory can still be found in the UK in a variation of guises; in Sidmouth (12 plays), Wolverhampton (8 plays), Burslem and Taunton (4 each). The Sheringham Little Theatre produces an in-house repertory season each summer, running from June until September. Weekly Repertory theatre is also produced by the Summer Theatre season at Frinton-on-Sea. This season has been running for seventy seven seasons now, and until recently maintained its links with the oldest traditions of British commercial theatre by being run by the actor Jack Watling, his son Giles and his son-in-law Seymour Matthews. In 2004 it was taken over by Edward Max, who ran it alone until 2012. For the next two years it was run by mtp Ltd. Now Clive Brill is the producer, working with Edward as General Manager. The recent 75th anniversary season was marked with a stage appearance by Richard Wilson, who has since become the Patron of the Friends of Frinton Theatre. \nFrinton saw the early launch of actors such as Michael Denison, Vanessa Redgrave, David Suchet, Jack Klaff, Neil Dudgeon, Owen Teale and Lynda Bellingham. Theatre practices like this remain popular within theatre communities and continue to give first jobs to graduating drama students.\nThe Company season at the Liverpool Everyman will launch in January 2017 and run until July, with 14 actors performing a season of five shows.\n\nIn the United States, the repertory system has also found a base to compete with commercial theatre. Repertory theatre with mostly changing casts and longer running plays, perhaps better classed as \"provincial\" or \"non-profit\" theatre, has made a big come-back, in cities such as Little Rock, AR, Washington, DC, Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Chicago, Los Angeles, Nashville, New York, Houston, Boston, San Francisco, San Diego, Buffalo, Kansas City, and Seattle. Festival theatre now provides actors with work in the summer.\n\nAmerica's oldest resident repertory theatre, Hedgerow Theatre, is located in Rose Valley, Pennsylvania. It was founded by actor Jasper Deeter in 1923. The present Producing Artistic Director is actress and director Penelope Reed. Other notable repertory theatres include the Guthrie Theatre, which was set up as regional repertory theatre concept that is free from commercial constraints in the choice of repertoire. It is aligned in objectives to the repertory and resident theatre movement that emerged in the United States in the 1960s. This sought to establish an alternative and decentralized theater network outside of New York, one with non-profit-making status and focused instead on the art of the theatre as well as the development of artists, craftsmen, and administrators. Publicly-funded theatres that belong to this type have been receiving erratic support since the 1980s.\n\nThe Association of Producing Artists (APA) was one of the most successful repertory theatres in the United States, touring for four years and holding residencies in several cities before finally joining the Phoenix Theatre in New York, where it was known for staging plays with modest prices. Presently, the American Repertory Theatre is considered one of the most distinguished repertory theatres in the United States. Since its foundation in 1979, it has earned several awards including a Pulitzer Prize (1982), a Tony Award (1986), and a Jujamcyn Award (1985).\n\nThe crowning achievement of repertory theatres in Canada are the world-renowned Stratford Shakespeare Festival, founded in 1953 to primarily present productions of William Shakespeare's plays and the Shaw Festival, founded in 1962, which presents plays written or set during the lifetime of George Bernard Shaw or following Shaw's ideal of socially provactive theatre.\n\nThe Vagabond Repertory Theatre Company was formed in March 2009 by artistic directors Nathaniel Fried and Ryan LaPlante, and currently resides and performs in Kingston, Ontario. But the old English-style repertory theatres such as Ottawa's CRT (Canadian Repertory Theatre), and Toronto's Crest Theatre no longer exist. Although they did have a version of summer theatre in smaller holiday districts, such as the \"Straw Hat\" players of Gravenhurst and Port Carling at Ontario's vacation Muskoka Lakes area.\n\nAmong the benefits of such a system are increased variety and better quality, due to fresh actors and shopped in directors. The theatre can afford to take risks, and a show that is likely to attract a large audience will effectively subsidize a show that is less likely, especially if season tickets are sold.\n\nDrawbacks to the repertoire system are increased production costs as each show will need separate sets, props, costumes and actors, (although sometimes an actor will be engaged to play in more than one production). Many such companies are large, and are able to have a smaller space available to workshop an experimental production or present playreadings. But the standard should be higher than under the old-time repertory system, because there will be more time for rehearsal. Also many repertoire companies today have non-profit status, so that budgets and income should be higher because they will not just depend upon ticket sales. However, the downside is that promotional costs will also be much higher due to having to employ a separate staff.\n\nIn April 2017, Glenda Jackson blamed the increase in TV viewers being unable to understand what actors are saying on the decline of the repertory system.\n\n\nMurray, Stephen. \"Taking Our Amusements Seriously\".

{"id": "41275963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41275963", "title": "Risk aversion (psychology)", "text": "Risk aversion (psychology)\n\nRisk aversion is a preference for a sure outcome over a gamble with higher or equal expected value. Conversely, the rejection of a sure thing in favor of a gamble of lower or equal expected value is known as risk-seeking behavior.\n\nThe psychophysics of chance induce overweighting of sure things and of improbable events, relative to events of moderate probability. Underweighting of moderate and high probabilities relative to sure things contributes to risk aversion in the realm of gains by reducing the attractiveness of positive gambles. The same effect also contributes to risk seeking in losses by attenuating the aversiveness of negative gambles. Low probabilities, however, are overweighted, which reverses the pattern described above: low probabilities enhance the value of long-shots and amplify aversion to a small chance of a severe loss. Consequently, people are often risk seeking in dealing with improbable gains and risk averse in dealing with unlikely losses.\n\nMost theoretical analyses of risky choices depict each option as a gamble that can yield various outcomes with different probabilities. Widely accepted risk-aversion theories, including Expected Utility Theory (EUT) and Prospect Theory (PT), arrive at risk aversion only indirectly, as a side effect of how outcomes are valued or how probabilities are judged. In these analyses, a value function indexes the attractiveness of varying outcomes, a weighting function quantifies the impact of probabilities, and value and weight are combined to establish a utility for each course of action. This last step, combining the weight and value in a meaningful way to make a decision, remains sub-optimal in EUT and PT, as people’s psychological assessments of risk do not match objective assessments.\n\nExpected Utility Theory (EUT) poses a utility calculation linearly combining weights and values of the probabilities associated with various outcomes. By presuming that decision-makers themselves incorporate an accurate weighting of probabilities into calculating expected values for their decision-making, EUT assumes that people’s subjective probability-weighting matches objective probability differences, when they are, in reality, exceedingly disparate.\n\n\"Consider the choice between a prospect that offers an 85% chance to win $1000 (with a 15% chance to win nothing) and the alternative of receiving $800 for sure. A large majority of people prefer the sure thing over the gamble, although the gamble has higher (mathematical) expected value (also known as expectation). The expected value of a monetary gamble is a weighted average, in which each possible outcome is weighted by its probability of occurrence. The expected value of the gamble in this example is .85 X $1000 + .15 X $0 = $850, which exceeds the expected value of $800 associated with the sure thing.\" \nResearch suggests that people do not evaluate prospects by the expected value of their monetary outcomes, but rather by the expected value of the subjective value of these outcomes (see also Expected utility). In most real-life situations, the probabilities associated with each outcome are not specified by the situation, but have to be subjectively estimated by the decision-maker. The subjective value of a gamble is again a weighted average, but now it is the subjective value of each outcome that is weighted by its probability. To explain risk aversion within this framework, Bernoulli proposed that subjective value, or utility, is a concave function of money. In such a function, the difference between the utilities of $200 and $100, for example, is greater than the utility difference between $1,200 and $1,100. It follows from concavity that the subjective value attached to a gain of $800 is more than 80% of the value of a gain of $1,000. Consequently, the concavity of the utility function entails a risk averse preference for a sure gain of $800 over an 80% chance to win $1,000, although the two prospects have the same monetary expected value.\n\nWhile EUT has dominated the analysis of decision-making under risk and has generally been accepted as a normative model of rational choice (telling us how we \"should\" make decisions), descriptive models of how people actually behave deviate significantly from this normative model.\n\nProspect Theory (PT) claims that fair gambles (gambles in which the expected value of the current option and all other alternatives are held equal) are unattractive on the gain side but attractive on the loss side. In contrast to EUT, PT is posited as an alternative theory of choice, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets (total wealth), and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. In an effort to capture inconsistencies in our preferences, PT offers a non-linear, S-shaped probability-weighted value function, implying that the decision-maker transforms probabilities along a diminishing sensitivity curve, in which the impact of a given change in probability diminishes with its distance from impossibility and certainty.\n\nThe value function shown is: \n\nA. Defined on gains and losses rather than on total wealth. Prospects are coded as gains and losses from a zero point (e.g. using current wealth, rather than total wealth as a reference point), leading people to be risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses.\n\nB. Concave in the domain of gains (risk aversion) and convex in the domain of losses (risk seeking). The negatively accelerated nature of the function implies that people are risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses.\n\nC. Considerably steeper for losses than for gains (\"see also loss aversion\"). Steepness of the utility function in the negative direction (for losses over gains) explains why people are risk-averse even for gambles with positive expected values. \nWhile risk aversion is not part of PT per se, a pertinent part of PT is gain-loss asymmetry with regard to risk. PT’s S-shaped probability-weighted, non-linear value function deems risk aversion context-dependent, as the gain-loss asymmetry illustrated above, results from our psychological assessments of risk hardly matching objective assessments of risk. One conceivable component of risk aversion in the framework of PT is that the degree of risk aversion apparent will vary depending on where along the curve our decision lies.\n\n\"Example: Participants are indifferent between receiving a lottery ticket offering a 1% chance at $200 and receiving $10 for sure. Additionally, people are indifferent between receiving a lottery ticket offering a 99% chance at $200 and receiving $188 for sure.\" \n\nIn line with diminishing sensitivity, the first hundredth of probability is worth $10, and the last hundredth is worth $12, but the 98 intermediate hundredths are worth only $178, or about $1.80 per hundredth. PT captures this pattern of differentially weighting (objective) probabilities subjectively with an S-shaped weighting function.\n\nA framing effect occurs when transparently and objectively identical situations generate dramatically different decisions depending on whether the situations are presented or perceived as either potential losses or gains. Framing effects play an integral role in risk -aversion, as an extension of PT’s S-shaped value function, which illustrates the differences in how gains and losses are valued relative to a reference point. \nRisky prospects are characterized by their possible outcomes and by the probabilities of these outcomes. The same, possible outcomes of a gamble can be framed either as gains or as losses relative to the status quo. The following pair of problems attests to the power of framing effects in manipulating either risk-averse or risk-seeking behavior.\n\n\"The total number of respondents in each problem is denoted by N, and the percentage who chose each option is indicated in parentheses.Problem 1 (N = 152): Imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed. Assume that the exact scientific estimates of the consequences of the programs are as follows:If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. (72%)If Program B is adopted, there is a one-third probability that 600 people will be saved and a two-thirds probability that no people will be saved. (28%)Which of the two programs would you favor?\".\"The formulation of Problem 1 implicitly adopts as a reference point a state of affairs in which the disease is allowed to take its toll of 600 lives. The outcomes of the programs include the reference state and two possible gains, measured by the number of lives saved. As expected, preferences are risk averse: a clear majority of respondents prefer saving 200 lives for sure over a gamble that offers a one-third chance of saving 600 lives.\n\nNow consider another problem in which the same cover story is followed by a different description of the prospects associated with the two programs:\"Problem 2 (N = 155): If Program C is adopted, 400 people will die. (22%)\"If Program D is adopted, there is a one-third probability that nobody will die and a two-thirds probability that 600 people will die. (78%)It is easy to verify that options C and D in Problem 2 are indistinguishable in real terms from options A and B in Problem 1, respectively. The second version, however, assumes a reference state in which no one dies of the disease. The best outcome is the maintenance of this state and the alternatives are losses measured by the number of people that will die of the disease. People who evaluate options in these terms are expected to show a risk-seeking preference for the gamble (option D) over the sure loss of 400 lives. Of course, the “sure loss” of 400 lives that participants found so unattractive is exactly the same outcome as the “sure gain” of 200 subjects found so attractive in the Problem 1. The public health problem illustrates a formulation effect in which a change of wording from \"lives saved\" to \"lives lost\" induced a marked shift of preference from risk aversion to risk seeking.\n\nIf preferences reverse based on inconsequential aspects of how the problem is framed, people cannot possibly be maximizing expected utility. Latent here is the unsettling idea that people’s preferences come from the outside (from whomever has the power to shape the environment and determine how questions are phrased), rather than from their own psychological makeup. Decision-making in matters as important as lives saved or lives lost can reverse risk preference. This may be based on a rephrasing of the outcomes that conveys no differential information about the treatments and that changes nothing about the outcomes themselves.\n\nWhile risk aversion is commonly explained through EUT and PT, observed risk-aversion behavior remains solely an artifact of these two theories, and extends beyond the bounds of what each theory can explain.\n\nBoth EUT and PT make the following falsifiable prediction: an individual cannot be so risk averse as to value a risky prospect less than the prospect’s worst possible outcome. On the contrary, several between-participant studies have found that people are willing to pay less, on average, for a binary lottery than for its worse outcome, a finding coined the uncertainty effect (UE).\n\n\"For example, people are willing to pay an average of $26 for a $50 gift certificate, but only $16 for a lottery that pays either a $50 or $100 gift certificate, with equal probability.\" \n\nUE, valuing a risky prospect below the value of its worse possible outcome, occurs as the result of a phenomenon known as direct risk aversion, a literal distaste for uncertainty, as uncertainty itself enters directly into people’s utility function.\n\nEUT and PT predict that people should not purchase insurance for small-stakes risks, yet such forms of insurance (e.g., electronic warranties, insurance policies with low deductibles, mail insurance, etc.) are very popular. Direct risk aversion may explain why, as people demonstrate their literal distaste for any and all levels of uncertainty. By paying a premium (often higher than the cost of replacement) for the possibility that insurance may come in handy, people display direct risk aversion by valuing a risky prospect below the value of its worst possible outcome (replacement at face-value). \n\"Suppose you are undecided whether or not to purchase earthquake insurance because the premium is quite high. As you hesitate, your friendly insurance agent comes forth with an alternative offer: \"For half the regular premium you can be fully covered if the quake occurs on an odd day of the month. This is a good deal because for half the price you are covered for more than half the days.\"\"\n\nWhy do most people find such probabilistic insurance distinctly unattractive? Starting anywhere in the region of low probabilities, the impact on the decision weight of a reduction of probability from p to p/2 is considerably smaller than the effect of a reduction from p/2 to 0. Reducing the risk by half, then, is not worth half the premium.\n\nThe aversion to probabilistic insurance is significant for three reasons. First, it undermines the classical explanation of insurance in terms of a concave utility function. According to EUT, probabilistic insurance should be definitely preferred to normal insurance when the latter is just acceptable. Second, probabilistic insurance represents many forms of protective action, such as having a medical checkup, buying new tires, or installing a burglar alarm system. Such actions typically reduce the probability of some hazard without eliminating it altogether. Third, the acceptability of insurance can be manipulated by the framing of the contingencies. An insurance policy that covers fire but not flood, for example, could be evaluated either as full protection against a specific risk, (e.g., fire) or as a reduction in the overall probability of property loss. People greatly undervalue a reduction in the probability of a hazard in comparison to the complete elimination of that hazard. Hence, insurance should appear more attractive when it is framed as the elimination of risk than when it is described as a reduction of risk.\n\nFurther, Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein (1982) showed that a hypothetical vaccine that reduces the probability of contracting a disease from 20% to 10% is less attractive if it is described as effective in half of the cases than if it is presented as fully effective against one of two exclusive and equally probable virus strains that produce identical symptoms.\n\nThe earliest studies of risk perception also found that, whereas risk and benefit tend to be positively correlated in the world, they are negatively correlated in people’s minds, and, therefore, judgments. The significance of this finding was not realized until a study by Alhakami and Slovic (1994) found that the inverse relation between perceived risk and perceived benefit of an activity (e.g., using pesticides) was linked to the strength of positive or negative affect associated with that activity as measured by rating the activity on bipolar scales such as good/bad, nice/awful, dread/not dread, and so forth. This result implies that people base their judgments of an activity or a technology not only on what they think about it but also on how they feel about it. If their feelings toward an activity are favorable, they are moved toward judging the risks as low and the benefits as high; if their feelings toward it are unfavorable, they tend to judge the opposite— high risk and low benefit (\"see also affect heuristic\").\n\nBoth EUT and PT are probability-outcome independent theories, as they posit separate functions for the evaluation of outcomes and probabilities. Both assume that the impact of a given probability is a function of that probability but not of the outcome to which it’s attached. Further, neither theory distinguishes one source of value from another. While probability-outcome independence may hold across outcomes of different monetary values, it is unlikely to hold across outcomes of varying \"affects\".\n\nIn 2001, two researchers from the University of Chicago, Rottenstreich and Hsee, conducted a series of three experiments to illustrate probability-outcome dependence, using an affective approach.\n\n\"Experiment 1: In an experiment observing probability-outcome interactions, a lottery ticket offers you a chance to meet and kiss your favorite movie-star as a prize (affect-rich) or $50 in cash (affect-poor). Each of the two conditions poses a 1% probability of the respective gamble occurring.\"\n\n\"Results & Implications: 70% of participants preferred the cash to the kiss under certainty, whereas 65% (nearly the reverse) preferred the kiss to the cash under low probability. This indicates that we weight what should be an objectively equal 1% probability in each scenario differently: a 1% probability is greater for the affect-rich kiss than for the affect-poor cash.\"\n\n\"Experiment 2: In a subsequent, and more realistic study, two similar and financially equivalent prizes - a $500 coupon redeemable toward payments associated with a European vacation (affect-rich) and a $500 coupon redeemable toward payment of tuition (affect-poor) were presented. For each prize, some participants were told they had a 1% chance of winning, and others a 99% chance of winning. Participants then had to indicate how much money they would have to be offered for them to be indifferent between receiving that dollar amount for sure and having the specified chance of winning the prize.\"\n\n\"Results & Implications: Although the two coupons had equivalent redemption values, the median price of the 1% chance of winning the European vacation was $20, but $5 for the tuition coupon, indicating that the weight of 1% we place on affect-rich prizes is greater than for affect-poor prizes. Based on results from the 1% condition, PT would predict that at a 99% chance of winning, the European coupon would still be priced higher than the tuition coupon. On the contrary, the affective approach found that in the 99% chance of winning condition, the median price of the European coupon was $450, whereas that of the tuition coupon was $478. Our weighting of the 99% probability as smaller for the affect-rich European coupon than the affect-poor tuition coupon indicates probability-outcome dependence for affect-rich outcomes. Affect-rich outcomes yield more pronounced overweighting of small probabilities, but more pronounced underweighting of large probabilities.\"\n\nBoth examples indicate probability-outcome dependence, as based on affect-rich outcomes, which changes the shape of PT’s S-shaped curve.\n\nIn Experiment 2, the size of the affect-rich jump in the weighting function is much greater ($500 – $450 = $50) than the size of the affect-poor jump ($500 – $478 = $22). Thus, weighting functions will be more S-shaped for lotteries involving affect-rich than affect-poor outcomes. That is, people will be more sensitive to departures from impossibility and certainty (from hope and fear), but less sensitive to intermediate probability variations for affect-rich outcomes, resulting in larger jumps at the endpoints of the weighting function. Results from this study suggest that the assumption of probability-outcome independence adopted by both EUT and PT may hold across outcomes of different monetary values, but not different affective values.\n\nThe outcomes studies in Experiments 1 and 2 were gains above the status quo. When a positive outcome is available, any departure from impossibility may engender hope (affect-rich and positive), and any deviation from certainty may produce fear (affect-rich but negative). The following study demonstrates that the opposite pattern is also true: when the available outcome is negative, departures from impossibility engender fear, and deviations from certainty produce hope.\n\n\"Experiment 3: Participants were told to imagine themselves in a hypothetical experiment entailing either a certain, 1% or 99% chance of a short, painful but not dangerous electric shock (affect-rich), and others were told that the experiment entailed either a 1% or 99% chance of a cash penalty (affect-poor, relatively). They were then asked to indicate how much money they would have to pay for them to be indifferent between paying that amount for sure and participating in the hypothetical experiment.\n\nCertainty condition: The median price paid to avoid an electric shock was $19.86. Most participants (24/30) preferred receiving the shock over paying more than $20.\n\nLow-probability condition: The median price paid to avoid a 1% chance of a shock was $7, substantially greater than the median price paid to avoid a 1% chance of a $20 penalty. As before, the weight of a 1% probability is greater for the affect-rich shock than for the affect-poor cash payment.\n\nHigh-probability condition: The median price paid to avoid a 99% chance of shock, $10, was substantially lower than the median price paid to avoid a 99% chance of cash penalty, $18.\n\nResults: Taken together, for the affect-rich electric shock, the size of the right-hand jump in the weighting function is about $10 ($19.86 - $10), but for the affect-poor cash penalty, the size of this jump is much smaller at $2 ($20 - $18). Again, we see that the weight of the 99% is smaller for the affect-rich shock than for the affect-poor cash.\"\nBoth Experiments 1 and 2 investigated outcomes that were gains over the status quo. Experiment 3 studied negative outcomes and also found evidence of a weighting function that is more S-shaped for affect-rich that affect-poor prizes. Therefore, probability-outcome dependence based on the affect-rich psychology of risk applies in the domains of both gains and losses.\n\nDo you remember the worst thing that has happened to you? What about the best? At what frequency are you able to recall memories that are negative in comparison to those that are positive? Does it seem like negative information is remembered with more ease and clarity than positive information? Why is it easier to know the percentage of fatal car accidents each year, as opposed to the percentage of accidents without fatalities?\nThe human brain demonstrates a partiality for the processing of negative information. In comparison with their positive counterparts, negative stimuli receive a larger allocation of attention and a swifter response once recognized by the brain. This bias for negative information occurs very early on in the stages of processing, seen in the appearance of a P1, a component of the event-related potentials (ERP) gathered from an EEG (electroencephalography) output. Researchers localized this particular ERP to the ventrolateral occipital cortex. Given that a greater amount of attention is allotted to the processing of negative stimuli, the negativity bias may also be indicative of an attentional bias.\nThe negativity bias is noticeable in a plethora of situations related to the formation of risk-averse behaviour. Notably, any stimuli that evokes the expression of fear encourages risk -aversion. The human brain has adapted to easily parse out these stimuli from a sea of benign stimuli. In the laboratory, participants report and respond more quickly to negative stimuli; Photos of negative and threatening pictures jump out of an array of photos, capturing participants’ attention more than positive or neutral pictures. Non-tangibles, such as personality traits, also demonstrate a similar impact for eliciting risk-averse behaviour. Carleston & Skowronski (1989) found that negative traits form a stronger impression on an individual than positive traits, thus affecting the overall impression of the individual being evaluated.\n\nAn individual’s affect often determines the extent to which one’s behaviour is effective in obtaining their goal. Decision making and emotion, intertwined, cannot be separated from each other, as emotion can either benefit or hinder the attainment of maximized utility.\n\nThree different emotional states influence decision making:\nYour current emotional state (i.e. How do you feel while you are making a decision?)\nYour past emotional state (i.e. How did you feel anticipating your decision?)\nYour future emotional state (i.e. How will your decision affect how you feel in the future; What effect will the decision have on your emotional well-being?)\n\nResearching decision-making and affect, Antoine Bechara, Antonio Damasio and colleagues (2000; 2005) discovered that damage to a brain area associated with emotional processing impairs effective decision-making. After discovering that damage to the orbitofrontal cortex impaired participants from making goal-oriented decisions in social and professional contexts, Damasio and his colleagues designed the Iowa Gambling Task. In creating this task, Damasio wondered whether decision-making was afflicted because emotion was a necessary component to making effective decisions.\n\nIn the task, participants continuously draw from one out of four possible decks – participants may switch decks at any point during the study.\n\nEach card possesses monetary value, resulting in either gains or losses.\n\nParticipants are unaware that 2 of the decks correspond to net winnings – low payoffs and even lower losses. The other 2 decks correspond to net losses – high payoffs and even higher losses.\n\nResearchers instruct participants to maximize their utility – gain the most money by the end of the task. In order to complete this task successfully, participants must discern that the decks associated with net winning, yet low payoffs, maximize their utility.\"\n\nResults. Damasio noticed that participants with damage to their orbitofrontal cortex were unable to realize that the deck associated with low payoffs yielded higher reward. From his discovery using the Iowa Gambling Task, Damasio formulated a Somatic marker hypothesis.\n\nAlternate Conclusions. Other researchers suggest that the difficulty encountered by patients with orbitofrontal cortex damage on Iowa Gambling Task is because the task requires participants to change their initial perception of potential gains and losses. Participants are lured in by appealing rewards, then confronted with devastating losses. Thus, orbitofrontal cortex damage inhibits the adaptation to changing patterns of rewards and punishment. This conclusion has been replicated in primates, where orbitofrontal damage prevented the extinction of a learned association.\n\nDamasio posited that emotional information in the form of physiological arousal, is needed to inform decision making. When confronted with a decision, we may react emotionally to the situation, a reaction that manifests as changes in physiological arousal in the body, or somatic markers. Given data collected from the Iowa Gambling Task, Damasio postulated that the orbitofrontal cortex assists individuals in forming an association between somatic markers and the situations that trigger them. Once an association is made, the orbitofrontal cortex and other brain areas evaluate an individual’s previous experiences eliciting similar somatic markers. Once recognized, the orbitofrontal cortex can determine an adequate and swift behavioural response, and its likeliness for reward.\n\nSeveral brain areas are observed in the expression of risk-averse behaviour. The previously mentioned orbitofrontal cortex is amongst these brain areas, supporting the feeling of regret. Regret, an emotion which heavily influences decision making, leads individuals to make decisions which circumvent encountering this emotion in the future.\n\nStudying brain activity associated with regret, researcher Georgio Coricelli and his colleagues (2005) triggered feelings of regret in healthy participants, by having them complete a gambling task in which they were informed that the best choice was the unchosen option. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Coricelli found that increasing regret correlated with increased activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the anterior hippocampus. The higher the activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, the greater the reported regret. After repeated trials, researchers began to observe risk averse behaviour by their participants, a behaviour echoed in intensified activity within the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala.\n\nRisk-averse behaviors are the culmination of several neural correlates. While avoiding negative stimuli, perceived or real, is a simple enough action, it requires anticipation, motivation and reasoning. How do you know a stimulus is malevolent? What information leads you to ultimately behave in a manner consistent with ensuring or endangering your well-being? Each of these questions recruit a different brain area, playing a poignant role in whether a decision is beneficial to an individual.\n\nFear-Conditioning. Over time, individuals learn that a stimulus is not benign through personal experience. Implicitly, a fear of a particular stimulus can develop, resulting in risk-averse behaviour. Traditionally, fear-conditioning is not associated with decision-making, but rather the pairing of a neutral stimulus with an aversive situation. Once an association is formed between the neutral stimulus and aversive event, a startle response is observed each time the neutral stimulus is presented. An aversion to the presentation of the neutral stimulus is observed after repeated trials.\n\nEssential to understanding risk aversion is the implicit learning that occurs during fear-conditioning. Risk aversion is the culmination of implicitly or explicitly acquired knowledge that informs an individual that a particular situation is aversive to their psychological well-being. Similarly, fear-conditioning is the acquisition of knowledge that informs an individual that a particular neutral stimulus now predicts an event that endangers their psychological or physical well-being.\n\nResearchers such as Mike Davis (1992) and Joseph LeDoux (1996), have deciphered the neural correlates responsible for the acquisition of fear-conditioning.\n\nThe amygdala, previously mentioned as a region showing high activity for the emotion of regret, is the central recipient for brain activity concerning fear-conditioning. Several streams of information from multiple brain areas converge on the lateral amygdala, allowing for the creation of associations that regulate fear-conditioning; Cells in the superior dorsal lateral amygdala are able to rapidly pair the neutral stimulus with the aversive stimulus. Cells that project from the lateral amygdala to the central amygdala allow for the initiation of an emotional response if a stimulus is deemed threatening.\n\n\"Cognitive Control\". Evaluating a gamble and calculating its expected value requires a certain amount of cognitive control. Several brain areas are dedicated to monitoring the congruence between expected and actual outcomes. Evidence by Ridderinkhof et al. (2004) suggests that the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) are involved in goal-directed performance monitoring and behaviour modulation. The pMPC monitors response conflicts (any situation that activates more than one response tendency), decision uncertainty, and any deviation from the anticipated outcome. Activation in the pMPC increases significantly after an error, response conflict, or unfavorable outcome is detected. As a result, the pMFC can signal a need for performance adjustment; there is a lack of evidence, however, indicating that the pMFC controls modulatory behaviour. Behaviour control processes in the LPFC have been implicated in the modulatory behaviour observed by researchers.\n\nThe field of neuroeconomics is emerging as a unified branch of knowledge, intending to merge information from psychology, economics and neuroscience with hopes of better understanding human behaviour. Risk aversion poses a mystifying question that intrigues experts in all three disciplines. Why is it that humans do not act in accord with their anticipated outcome? Whilst negative outcomes retain more value than positive outcome, human beings do not make logical decisions. Parsing out emotion and fear of loss from decision making would result in more implementation of mathematical calculations, thus maximizing expected utility. While activation in specific brain areas can highlight the mechanisms of decision making, evidence continues to support the prevalence of risk-averse behaviour.\n\n"}

The event was launched as a partnership between Singaporean agencies Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and the Defence Science and Technology Agency after the relocation of Asian Aerospace from Singapore. It hosts high-level government and military delegations, as well as senior corporate executives around the world, while serving as a global event for leading aerospace companies and budding players (including start-ups) to make their mark in the international aerospace and defence market. The event offers a unique platform for industry thought leadership through its high-level conferences, forums and co-located events. Leading industry players, government and military chiefs gather here bi-annually to contribute to dialogues, exchange ideas and seek solutions and strategies to advance the interests of the global aerospace and defence sector.\n\nIt is cited to be the third largest air show in the world after Le Bourget and Farnborough, as well as Asia's largest air show, although this is disputed by the Dubai Air Show.\n\nThe selected venue for the permanent site of Singapore Airshow is situated on a plot of land just beyond the northern edge perimeter fencing of Changi Air Base, which was itself located due east of the nearby Singapore Changi Airport. In 2006, a contract worth S$60 million was awarded to Eng Lim Construction to begin the building of the new exhibition site to replace the Changi International Exhibition and Convention Centre, including a main exhibition hall with 40,000 square metres of space.\n\nWhen completed in September 2007, the new site boasted a 40,000 square metres of fully air-conditioned exhibition hall, 2,000 parking lots for trade visitors and motorists as well as 100,000 square metres of outdoor space for exhibitions and functions. Upon its completion, the hall was promptly named as the Changi Exhibition Centre to set it apart from the Changi International Exhibition and Convention Centre which had been in use by the Asian Aerospace exhibitions from 1988 to 2006. Note that the old site is a good 2 kilometres due west of the current one.\n\nThe inaugural show was held from 19 to 24 February 2008, with the first four days reserved for trade visitors at the purpose-built Changi Exhibition Centre in Changi. Besides the usual exhibits and static displays, the event saw the return of aerobatic flying displays put up by the Airbus A380, Black Knights of the Republic of Singapore Air Force and the Roulettes of the Royal Australian Air Force. Also held concurrently are several seminars and conferences, including the Singapore Airshow Aviation Leadership Summit, the Global Air Power Conference, the International Defence Procurement Conference, the C4I Asia Conference and the Global Space and Technology Convention. The static displays included several themed exhibition pavilions, including the Airport Pavilion and the Integrated Land Defence Pavilion. The ATW Airline Industry Achievement Awards was also held during the Airshow.\n\nPrior to the commencement of the 2008 Singapore Airshow, deals to be announced or concluded was expected to reach into billions of dollars. Deals since announced include:\n\n\nSingapore Airshow 2010, held at the Changi Exhibition Centre from 2 to 7 February 2010, featured more than 800 exhibiting companies from over 40 countries. More than 60 of the top 100 global aerospace companies participated, including Boeing, EADS, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Rolls-Royce.

{"id": "493126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=493126", "title": "The Nairobi Trio", "text": "The Nairobi Trio\n\nThe Nairobi Trio was a sketch comedy skit that Ernie Kovacs performed many times for his TV shows. It combined several existing concepts and visuals in a novel and creative way.\n\nPeople in gorilla suits had long been a comedy staple. The ploy of well-known, predictable music pieces gone awry had been practiced by artists as diverse as Stan Freberg, Spike Jones, and P. D. Q. Bach. The \"slow burn\" of one character being annoyed by another, resulting in eventual retaliation, was not new. But the combination of all of those ingredients, combined with impeccable timing, produced a unique and memorable result.\n\nThe skit was a live-action version of a child's animatronic wind-up music box, performed to the tune \"Solfeggio\" by Robert Maxwell. According to an interview with Edie Adams in John Barbour's 1982 documentary \"Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius\", Barry Shear, Kovacs's director at DuMont Television Network, brought the tune to Kovacs's attention in 1954. When Kovacs first heard \"Solfeggio,\" as recorded in 1953 by harpist Robert Maxwell and The Ray Charles Singers, he immediately came up with a mental image of what would become The Nairobi Trio: Maxwell's composition was popular enough with audiences that Maxwell recorded a new version (as The Fortune-Tellers) and released it as \"Song of the Nairobi Trio\".\n\nOf the three gorillas shown, all wearing hats, long coats, and white gloves, the middle gorilla, always played by Kovacs with a cigar, conducted the musicians with either a baton or a banana. To the viewer's left stood a gorilla holding two oversized timpani mallets. The identity of this ape varied, but among Kovacs's celebrity friends both Jack Lemmon and Frank Sinatra are known to have performed the character. Seated at a piano at screen right was a female simian, variously played by Barbara Loden, Jolene Brand, and Kovacs's wife, Edie Adams, who robotically thumped her hands up and down on the keys.\n\nNearly all of the Nairobi Trio skits operated in the same fashion. As \"Solfeggio\" plays, the gorilla with the mallets repeatedly uses the center gorilla's (Kovacs's) head like a drum at the end of every phrase, punctuating the song's sharp \"ba-da-BUM\" bongo riff. Every time this happens it brings a slightly changed and escalating response from the victim, who eventually tries to anticipate the mallet assaults and outwit the perpetrator. Ultimately staring him down, Kovacs, in the gorilla suit, is eventually distracted by the third gorilla, which allows the drummer to give him three final blows. The victimized gorilla then stands up and smashes a prop vase over the percussionist's head. The sketch was repeated many times over the course of Kovacs's career. The audio was always \"Solfeggio\" but the staging changed occasionally; one variation had the first and second gorillas handling building blocks in tempo, with the third gorilla pounding at a xylophone.\n\nThe Nairobi Trio became so popular that M-G-M Records reissued Robert Maxwell's \"Solfeggio\" as \"Song of the Nairobi Trio\" in 1957. Edie Adams later said that the skits were simple enough for any one of Kovacs's friends and associates to step into the drummer's role without needing a rehearsal, and that the gorilla masks provided anonymity.\n\nThe last time the routine was performed was on one of Kovacs's 1960s ABC specials shortly before his untimely death. On this occasion the combination of a bigger budget, the use of videotape, and the luxury of retakes helped him to perfect the timing of the sketch. But the Nairobi Trio wasn't always confined to silence with \"Solfeggio\" playing; they went into outer space and also became safe crackers on a US Steel special, \"Private Eye, Private Eye\", which aired on CBS on March 8, 1961.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17441828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17441828", "title": "Waltz with Bashir", "text": "Waltz with Bashir\n\nWaltz with Bashir (, translit. Vals Im Bashir) is a 2008 Israeli animated war documentary film written and directed by Ari Folman. It depicts Folman in search of his lost memories of his experience as a soldier in the 1982 Lebanon War.\n\nThis film and \"$9.99\", also released in 2008, are the first Israeli animated feature-length films released theatrically since Alina and Yoram Gross's \"Ba'al Hahalomot\" (1962). \"Waltz with Bashir\" premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival where it entered the competition for the Palme d'Or, and since then has won and been nominated for many additional important awards while receiving wide acclaim from critics. It won a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, an NSFC Award for Best Film, a César Award for Best Foreign Film and an IDA Award for Feature Documentary, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language and an Annie Award for Best Animated Feature.\n\nIn 1982, Ari Folman was a 19-year-old IDF infantry soldier. In 2006, he meets with a friend from that period, who tells him of the nightmares he's having connected to his experiences from the Lebanon War. Folman is surprised to find that he recalls nothing from that period. Later that night he has a vision from the night of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, the reality of which he is unable to clearly recall. In his memory, he and his soldier comrades are bathing at night by the seaside in Beirut under the light of flares descending over the city.\n\nFolman rushes off to meet a childhood friend, who advises him to seek out others who were in Beirut at the same time, to understand what happened there and to revive his own memories. Folman converses with friends and other soldiers who served in the war, among others a psychologist, and Israeli TV reporter Ron Ben-Yishai, who covered Beirut at the time. Folman eventually realizes that he \"was in the second or third ring\" of soldiers surrounding the Palestinian refugee camp where the carnage was perpetrated, and that he was among those soldiers firing flares into the sky to illuminate the refugee camp for the Lebanese Christian Phalange militia perpetrating the massacre inside. He concludes that his amnesia stemmed from his feeling as a teenage soldier that he was as guilty of the massacre as those who actually carried it out. The film ends with animation dissolving into actual footage of the aftermath of the massacre.\n\nThe film contains both fictional composites of real-life figures and actual living people.\n\nThe film takes its title from a scene in which Shmuel Frenkel, one of the interviewees and the commander of Folman's infantry unit at the time of the film's events, grabs a general purpose machine gun and \"dances an insane waltz\" (to the tune of Chopin's Waltz in C-sharp minor) amid heavy enemy fire on a Beirut street festooned with huge posters of Bashir Gemayel. Thematically, the film's title is a symbolic description of the \"Waltz\", which is a dance for a couple, that Folman is \"dancing\" with his memories from the war in Lebanon. The title also refers to Israel's short-lived political waltz with Bashir Gemayel as president of Lebanon. Others have speculated that the title is a reference to Kurt Vonnegut's satirical novel \"Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death\".\n\nThe film took four years to complete. It is unusual in it being a feature-length documentary made almost entirely by the means of animation. It combines classical music, 1980s music, realistic graphics, and surrealistic scenes together with illustrations similar to comics. The entire film is animated, excluding one short segment of news archive footage.\n\nThe animation, with its dark hues representing the overall feel of the film, uses a unique style invented by Yoni Goodman at the Bridgit Folman Film Gang studio in Israel. The technique is often confused with rotoscoping, an animation style that uses drawings over live footage, but is actually a combination of Adobe Flash cutouts and classic animation. Each drawing was sliced into hundreds of pieces which were moved in relation to one another, thus creating the illusion of movement. The film was first shot in a sound studio as a 90-minute video and then transferred to a storyboard. From there 2,300 original illustrations were drawn based on the storyboard, which together formed the actual film scenes using Flash animation, classic animation, and 3D technologies.\n\nThe original soundtrack was composed by minimalist electronic musician Max Richter while the featured songs are by OMD (\"Enola Gay\"), PiL (\"This is Not a Love Song\"), Navadey Haukaf (נוודי האוכף\n)(\"Good Morning Lebanon\", written for the film), Haclique (\"Incubator\"), and Zeev Tene (a remake of the Cake song \"I Bombed Korea\", retitled \"Beirut\"). Some reviewers have viewed the music as playing an active role as commentator on events instead of simple accompaniment.\n\nThe comics medium, in particular Joe Sacco, the novels \"Catch-22\", \"The Adventures of Wesley Jackson\", and \"Slaughterhouse-Five\", and painter Otto Dix were mentioned by Folman and art director David Polonsky as influences on the film. The film itself was adapted into a graphic novel in 2009.\n\n\"Waltz with Bashir\" opened in the United States on 25 December 2008 in a mere five theaters, where it grossed $50,021 in the first weekend. By the end of its run on 14 May 2009, the film had grossed $2,283,849 in the domestic box office. Overseas, \"Waltz\" earned $8,842,000 for a worldwide total of $11,125,849.\n\nAs of March 2017, the film holds a 96% \"fresh\" rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 149 critics for an average of 8.4/10; the general consensus states: \"A wholly innovative, original, and vital history lesson, with pioneering animation, \"Waltz With Bashir\" delivers its message about the Middle East in a mesmerizing fashion.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 91/100 based on 33 critics, indicating “universal acclaim”.\n\n\"indieWire\" named the film the tenth best of the year, based on the site's annual survey of 100 film critics. Xan Brooks of \"The Guardian\" called it \"an extraordinary, harrowing, provocative picture.\" The film was praised for \"inventing a new cinematographic language\" at the Tokyo Filmex festival. The World Socialist Web Site's David Walsh described it as a \"painfully honest\" anti-war film and \"one of the most extraordinary and haunting films at the Toronto film festival.\" Despite the positive critical reception, the film was only moderately commercially successful in Israel itself.\n\nThe film is banned in some Arab countries (including Lebanon), with the most harsh critics in Lebanon, as the film depicts a vague and violent time in Lebanon's history. A movement of bloggers, among them the Lebanese Inner Circle, +961 and others have rebelled against the Lebanese government's ban of the film, and have managed to get the film seen by local Lebanese critics, in defiance of their government's request on banning it. The film was privately screened in January 2009 in Beirut in front of 90 people. Since then many screenings have taken place. Unofficial copies are also available in the country. Folman saw the screening as a source of great pride: \"I was overwhelmed and excited. I wish I could have been there. I wish one day I'll be able to present the film myself in Beirut. For me, it will be the happiest day of my life.\"\n\nThe film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008.\n\n\n\nIt was also ranked #34 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010, and #4 in Current TV's \"50 Documentaries to See Before You Die\" in 2011.\n\n\"Waltz with Bashir\" became the first animated film to have received a nomination for either an Academy Award or a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Also the first R-rated animated film to be considered for those honors. It also became the first Israeli winner of the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film since \"The Policeman\" (1971), and the first documentary film to win the award.\n\nIt was unsuccessfully submitted for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature nomination, and became ineligible for the Academy Award for Documentary Feature when the Academy announced its new rule to nominate only documentaries which have had a qualifying run in both New York and Los Angeles by 31 August.\n\nThe film was also included in the National Board of Review's Top Foreign Films list. Folman won the WGA's Best Documentary Feature Screenplay award and the DGA's Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Documentary award for creating the film. Folman also received nominations for Annie Awards and BAFTA Awards for Best Animated Feature, but lost both awards to \"Kung Fu Panda\" and \"WALL-E\" respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
