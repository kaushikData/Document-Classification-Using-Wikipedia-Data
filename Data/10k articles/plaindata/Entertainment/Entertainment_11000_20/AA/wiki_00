It lasted , just one week less than the 1988 writers strike. The strike against the producers lasted from January 16, 1960, until June 10, 1960 (agreement reached June 10, but not signed until June 12). The strike against the networks began on March 19. Negotiations were between the Writers Guild of America, west, the Writers Guild of America, East, and the Association of Motion Picture Producers.\n\nFor a time, the actors were on strike at the same time, but they had returned to work before the writers reached a compromise with the movie companies.\n\nThe conflict was about writer's right to receive a share of revenue of the studios from the lease or sale of movies to television.\n\nSeven of the eight major studios struck a deal: Allied Artists, Columbia, MGM, Paramount, Twentieth-Century Fox, Walt Disney, and Warner Bros. The eighth, Universal International, had reached an agreement before the strike broke out. The settlement included having the studios pay into the writers' pension and health funds in the amount of $600,000. They also agreed to give 5% of the studio's income from movies pre-1960 which were on television. On post-1960 movies, writers got 2% of income. If the film was shown on pay-TV, they would not receive additional income. The minimum rates were also increased to $350 a week and writers would get a 10% raise for the first two years and then 5% for the next year and a half.\n\nFor television writers, minimum wages increased 100 percent for the first two years and 100 for the next two. Writers for low-budget half hour shows would get $935 instead of $850. High budget writers would get $1,200 instead of $1,100. Writers would get a 4% royalty domestically and internationally on all reruns \"in perpetuity\". In the past, writers were paid on only the first five domestic reruns (they got 140% of their minimum pay scale for that). They also agreed to create a health and welfare fund.\n\n"}

The games were formally opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. She referred to the Commonwealth's \"shared ideals and ambitions\" and the \"bonds that unite\" its members.\n\nThe programme, which included about 2,000 performers, featured Karen Dunbar, John Barrowman, Amy Macdonald, Rod Stewart, Susan Boyle, Nicola Benedetti, Julie Fowlis, Pumeza Matshikiza, Eric Whitacre and the National Youth Choir of Scotland, as well as a message from the International Space Station. The ceremony began with a countdown and a recorded video message from Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, explaining the partnership between the Games and UNICEF.\n\nFollowing the arrival of the Queen there was a flypast by the Red Arrows display team. The venue featured the largest LED video screen in Europe, supplied by Sports Technology. Scotland's then First Minister Alex Salmond welcomed the participants and spectators, and introduced a moment of silence in memory of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster.\n\nThe final part of the Queen's Baton Relay was run by 32 Scottish volunteers nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to Sir Chris Hoy, who delivered it to President of the Commonwealth Games Federation HRH Prince Imran and the Queen. The display of the message concealed within the baton was delayed by a difficulty in opening the device.\n\nThe Games were launched in partnership with UNICEF, to save and change children’s lives. The unique partnership aimed \"to use the power of sport to reach every child in Scotland and benefit children in every Commonwealth nation and territory.\"\n\nThe ceremony was broadcast by BBC One, and was introduced by Gary Lineker, Hazel Irvine, Clare Balding and Huw Edwards. The estimated worldwide television audience was one billion, with 9 million in the UK.\n\n\n"}

Neuman is the fictitious mascot and cover boy of the American humor magazine \"Mad\". The character's face had drifted through U.S. iconography for decades (it appeared in the early 1930s on a presidential campaign postcard with the caption, \"Sure I'm for Roosevelt\") before being claimed by \"Mad\" editor Harvey Kurtzman in 1954 and later named by the magazine's second editor Al Feldstein in 1956. Since his debut in \"Mad\", Neuman's likeness has appeared on the cover of all but a handful of the magazine's 550+ issues, distinguished by jug ears, a missing front tooth, and one eye lower than the other. His face is rarely seen in profile; he has virtually always been shown in front view, directly from behind, or in silhouette. \n\nHarvey Kurtzman first spotted the image on a postcard pinned to the office bulletin board of Ballantine Books editor Bernard Shir-Cliff. \"It was a face that didn't have a care in the world, except mischief\", recalled Kurtzman. Shir-Cliff was later a contributor to various magazines created by Kurtzman.\n\nIn November 1954, Neuman made his \"Mad\" debut on the front cover of Ballantine's \"The Mad Reader\", a paperback collection of reprints from the first two years of \"Mad\". The character's first appearance in the comic book was on the cover of \"Mad\" #21 (March 1955), in a tiny image as part of a mock advertisement. A rubber mask bearing his likeness with \"idiot\" written underneath was offered for $1.29.\n\"Mad\" switched to a magazine format starting with issue #24, and Neuman's face appeared in the top, central position of the illustrated border used on the covers, with his now-familiar signature phrase \"What, me worry?\" written underneath. Initially, the phrase was rendered \"What? Me worry?\" These borders were used for five more issues, through \"Mad\" #30 (December 1956).\n\nThe character was also shown on page 9 of Mad #24 as \"Melvin Coznowski\" and on page 65 as \"Melvin Sturdley\". In later issues he appeared as \"Melvin Cowsnofsky\" or \"Mel Haney\". In \"Mad\" #25, the face and name were shown together on separate pages as both Neuman and Mel Haney. The crowded cover shot on \"Mad\" #27 marked Neuman's first color appearance.\n\nWhen Al Feldstein took over as \"Mad\"s editor in 1956, he seized upon the face:\n\nMingo's defining portrait was used on the cover of \"Mad\" #30 in late 1956 as a supposed write-in candidate for the Presidency, and fixed his identity and appearance into the version that has been used ever since. In November 2008, Mingo's original cover art featuring this first official portrait of Neuman sold at auction for $203,150. Mingo painted seven more Neuman covers through 1957, and later returned to become the magazine's signature cover artist throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Mingo produced 97 \"Mad\" covers in total, and also illustrated dozens of additional cover images for \"Mad\"'s many reprint Specials and its line of paperbacks.\n\nDuring Mingo's absence, Frank Kelly Freas rendered Neuman for \"Mad\" from 1958 to 1962. Mingo's total surpassed Freas' in 1965, and his leading status endured until 2016, when current contributor Mark Fredrickson became the most prolific \"Mad\" cover artist with his 98th cover.\n\nNeuman has appeared in one form or another on the cover of nearly every issue of \"Mad\" and its spinoffs since that issue and continuing to the present day, with a small handful of exceptions. Two such departures were \"Mad\" #233 (September 1982) which replaced Neuman's image with that of Pac-Man, and \"Mad\" #195 (December 1977) which instead featured the message \"Pssst! Keep This Issue Out of the Hands of Your Parents! (Make 'Em Buy Their Own Copy!)\". Even when Neuman is not part of the cover gag, or when the cover is entirely text-based, his disembodied head generally appears in miniature form. The most notorious Neuman-free cover was #166 (April 1974), which featured a human hand giving the profane \"middle finger\" gesture while declaring \"Mad\" to be \"The Number One Ecch Magazine\". Some newsstands that normally carried \"Mad\" chose not to display or sell this issue.\n\nConversely, the two covers that featured Neuman the most times were #502 (January 2010), and #400 (December 2000). #502 featured a human hand giving the \"thumbs down\" signal, while wearing a silver-spangled glove in the style of singer Michael Jackson. Each individual spangle, more than 300 in all, was a tiny Alfred E. Neuman face. The cover of issue #400 was a photomosaic of Neuman's face, composed of more than 2,700 images of previous \"Mad\" covers.\n\nNeuman's ubiquity as a grinning cover boy grew as the magazine's circulation quadrupled, but the single highest-selling issue of \"Mad\" depicted only his feet. The cover image of issue #161, spoofing the 1972 film \"The Poseidon Adventure\", showed Neuman floating upside-down inside a life preserver. The original art for this cover was purchased at auction in 1992 for $2,200 by Annie Gaines, the widow of \"Mad\" founder and publisher William Gaines, and subsequently given on permanent loan to \"Mad\" writer Dick DeBartolo. The image was copied in 1998 for issue #369 spoofing the hit film \"Titanic\".\n\nA female version of Neuman, named \"Moxie Cowznofski\", appeared briefly during the late 1950s, occasionally described in editorial text as Neuman's \"girlfriend\". Neuman and Moxie were sometimes depicted side-by-side, defeating any speculation that Moxie was possibly Neuman in female guise. Her name was inspired by Moxie, a soft drink manufactured in Portland, Maine, which was sold nationwide in the 1950s and whose logo appeared as a running visual gag in many early issues of \"Mad\".\n\nIn late 1959, \"Mad\" released a 45 rpm single entitled \"What—Me Worry?\" (ABC-Paramount 10013), by \"Alfred E. Neuman and His Furshlugginer Five\", featuring an uncredited voice actor singing as Neuman. (The B-side of the single, \"Potrzebie\", is an instrumental.)\n\n\"Mad\" routinely portrays Neuman in the guise of another character or inanimate object for its cover images. Neuman has appeared as, among others, Santa Claus, Darth Vader, George Washington, King Kong, Baby New Year, Lawrence of Arabia, Batman, Robin, Spider-Man, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Rosemary's Baby, George S. Patton, the Fiddler on the Roof, an Aurora-style model kit, Alex from \"A Clockwork Orange\", \"Bonnie and Clyde\" actor Michael J. Pollard, Barbra Streisand, Mr. T, Indiana Jones, Radar O'Reilly, Bruce Springsteen, Max Headroom, Mr. Spock, Bart Simpson, Pee-Wee Herman, Michael Jackson, a California Raisin, a face on Mount Rushmore, as Egyptian hieroglyphics, part of a fireworks display, a jack-in-the-box, an engraved bottle stopper, a scarecrow, the Headless Horseman, the sequins on Michael Jackson's glove, Don King, Robin Hood, Abraham Lincoln, Guns N' Roses' Slash, Kim Pine, the Man in the Moon, an Oscar statuette, an \"Operation\" board game, Jabba the Hutt, Wolverine, Gollum, Lance Armstrong, SpongeBob SquarePants, Agent Smith from \"The Matrix\", Kurt Cobain, Shrek, Dr. Octopus, Dennis Rodman, \"The Incredibles\"' Jack-Jack, a zombie, a victim of a zombie swarm, a caveman, a fetus, a boa constrictor, a rat, a weathervane, a Ferengi, Greek column, the joker in a deck of cards, the bull's eye in a target, the three wise monkeys, part of a totem pole, a cigar label, George W. Bush, Justin Timberlake, Harry Potter, Lord Voldemort, Barry Bonds, Suri Cruise, Wilson the Volleyball, the Mona Lisa, Che Guevara, Lil Wayne, Barack Obama, Rorschach (from \"Watchmen\"), Adolf Hitler, Justin Bieber, Jimmy Carter, Finn the Human, and Uncle Sam (\"Who Needs You?\").\n\nSince his initial unsuccessful run in 1956, Neuman has periodically been re-offered as a candidate for President with the slogan, \"You could do worse... and always have!\"\nAlong with his face, \"Mad\" also includes a short humorous quotation credited to Neuman with every issue's table of contents. (Example: \"It takes one to know one... and vice versa!\") Some of these quotations were collected in the 1997 book \"Mad: The Half-Wit and Wisdom of Alfred E. Neuman\", which was illustrated by Sergio Aragonés.\n\nNeuman is now used exclusively as a mascot and iconic symbol of the magazine, but before this status was codified, he was referenced in several early articles. In one, Neuman answered a letter from a suicidal reader by giving \"expert advice\" on the best technique for tying a hangman's knot. Other articles featured the school newspaper of \"Neuman High School\", and a bulletin from \"Alfred E. Neuman University\". An article entitled \"Alfred E. Neuman's Family Tree\" depicted historical versions of Neuman from various eras. Since then, Neuman has appeared only occasionally inside the magazine's articles. A recurring article titled \"Alfred's Poor Almanac\" (a parody of Poor Richard's Almanac) showed his face atop the page, but otherwise the character had no role in the text. In a 1968 article, Neuman's face was assembled, feature by feature, from parts of photographs of well-known politicos, including then-President Lyndon B. Johnson (left ear), Richard Nixon (nose), Oregon Governor Mark Hatfield (eyes), and Ronald Reagan (hair). The gap in his teeth (which was otherwise the grin of Dwight D. Eisenhower) came from \"The 'Credibility Gap' Created by Practically All Politicians\".\n\nNeuman's famous motto is the intellectually incurious \"What, me worry?\" This was changed for one issue to \"Yes, me worry!\" after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. On the cover of current printings of the paperback \"The Ides of Mad\", as rendered by long-time cover artist Norman Mingo, Neuman is portrayed as a Roman bust with his catch phrase engraved on the base, translated into Dog Latin—\"Quid, Me Anxius Sum?\"\n\nNeuman's surname is often misspelled as \"Newman\".\n\nNeuman's most prominent physical feature is his gap-toothed grin, with a few notable exceptions. On the cover of issue #236 (January 1983), Neuman was featured with E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The cover showed E.T. using his famous \"healing finger\" to touch Neuman's mouth and cause the missing tooth to appear. The cover of issue #411 (November 2001), the first to be produced following the 9/11 attacks in the United States, showed a close-up of Neuman's face, but his gap was now filled with an American flag. A text gag on the cover of issue #263 (June 1986) claimed that the UPC was really a \"Close-up Photograph of Neuman's Missing Tooth\".\n\nNeuman also appeared as himself in a political cartoon, after \"Newsweek\" had been criticized for using computer graphics to retouch the teeth of Bobbi McCaughey. The cartoon was rendered in the form of a split-screen comparison, in which Neuman was featured on the cover of \"Mad\" with his usual gap-toothed grin, then also featured on the cover of \"Newsweek\", but with a perfect smile.\n\nDespite the primacy of Neuman's incomplete smile, his other facial features have occasionally attracted notice. Artist Andy Warhol said that seeing Neuman taught him to love people with big ears.\n\nIn 1958, \"Mad\" published letters from several readers noting the resemblance between Neuman and England's Prince Charles, then nine years old. Shortly thereafter, an angry letter under a Buckingham Palace letterhead arrived at the \"Mad\" offices: \"Dear Sirs No it isn't a bit—not the least little bit like me. So jolly well stow it! See! Charles. P.\" The letter was authenticated as having been written on triple-cream laid royal stationery bearing an official copper-engraved crest. The postmark indicated it had been mailed from a post office within a short walking distance of Buckingham Palace. Unfortunately, the original disappeared years ago while on loan to another magazine and has never been recovered.\n\nFor many years, \"Mad\" sold prints of the official portrait of Neuman through a small house ad on the letters page of the magazine. In the early years, the price was one for 25 cents; three for 50 cents; nine for a dollar; or 27 for two dollars. The ad stated that the prints could also be used for wrapping fish.\n\nA live-action version of Neuman—an uncredited actor wearing a mask—appears briefly in the 1980 film \"Up the Academy\" which was originally released to theaters as \"Mad Magazine Presents Up the Academy\". \"Mad\" later pulled its support from the film, and all footage of the Neuman character was excised from North American home video and television releases, although it was reinstated for the 2006 DVD release.\n\nNeuman appeared occasionally in the early seasons of \"MADtv\" during sketches and interstitials, and briefly appeared in the animated TV series \"Mad\".\n\nNeuman's precise origin is shrouded in mystery and may never be fully known. A collection of early Neumanesque images can be found in Maria Reidelbach's comprehensive work, \"Completely Mad: A History of the Comic Book and Magazine\" (Little, Brown, 1991). \"Mad\" publisher Bill Gaines gave Reidelbach total access to the magazine's own files, including the collection of Neuman-related images that had been assembled for a 1965 copyright infringement lawsuit.\n\nThe earliest image cited in Reidelbach's book is from an advertisement for Atmore's Mince Meat, Genuine English Plum Pudding. She wrote that, \"[d]ating from 1895, this is the oldest verified image of the boy... The kid's features are fully developed and unmistakable, and the image was very likely taken from an older archetype...\" After the publication of the book, an older \"archetype\" was discovered in an advertisement for the comical stage play, \"The New Boy\", which debuted on Broadway in 1894. The image is nearly identical to what later appears in the Atmore's ads.\n\nA description of the stage play's advertisement was published in the December 2, 1894, \"Los Angeles Herald\". Using words that could easily be describing the character of Alfred E. Neuman, the paper reported that the \"comic red-headed urchin with a joyous grin all over his freckled face, whose phiz [face] is the trademark of the comedy, is so expressive of the rollicking and ridiculous that the New York Herald and the Evening Telegram have applied it to political cartoon purposes.\" Elements of the plot of the play explain why the character has adult and childlike features, why the character is dressed as he is, and how he may have lost his teeth. The original \"New Boy\" image was published with a two-part phrase that is similar in tone to Neuman's, \"What? Me Worry?\" catch phrase: \"What's the good of anything?—Nothing!\"\n\nThe \"New Boy\" advertising image was copied widely in advertising for \"painless\" dentistry and other products. It is also possible that the image influenced the look of The Yellow Kid, the 1890s character from Richard F. Outcault's strip \"Hogan's Alley\". The image was used for a variety of purposes nearly continuously until it was adopted by \"Mad\".\n\nSimilar faces turned up in advertising for \"painless\" dentistry. According to Gaines, 'Alfie' has his origin in Topeka with the Painless Romine Topeka Dental College, actually a dental group at 704 Kansas Avenue, at the office of Dr. William Romine—often misspelled as Romaine—a dentist who resided and practiced in Wichita. A face virtually identical to Neuman's appears in the 1923 issue of the University of Minnesota humor magazine \"The Guffer\" above the caption \"Medic After Passing Con Exam in P. Chem.\" Another identical face shows up in the logo for Happy Jack Beverages, a soda drink produced by the A. B. Cook company in 1939. An almost-identical image appeared as \"nose art\" on an American World War II bomber, over the motto \"Me Worry?\" (this painted face was sometimes referred to as \"The Jolly Boy\").\nNeuman's image was also used negatively, as a \"supporter\" of rival political candidates, with the idea that only an idiot would vote for them. In 1940, those opposing Franklin Delano Roosevelt's third-term reelection bid distributed postcards with a similar caricature bearing the caption, \"Sure I'm for Roosevelt\". In some instances, there was also the implication that the \"idiot\" was in fact a Jewish caricature. Carl Djerassi's autobiography claims that in Vienna after the Anschluss, he saw posters with a similar face and the caption \"Tod den Juden\" (\"Kill the Jews\").\n\nThe EC editors grew up listening to radio, and this was frequently reflected in their stories, names and references. The name \"Alfred E. Neuman\" derived from comedian Henry Morgan's \"Here's Morgan\" radio series on Mutual, ABC and NBC. One character on his show had a name that was a reference to composer Alfred Newman, who scored many films and also composed the familiar fanfare that accompanies 20th Century Fox's opening film logo. The possible inspiration for Henry Morgan was that Laird Cregar portrayed Sir Henry Morgan in \"The Black Swan\" (1942) with Tyrone Power, and the Oscar-nominated score for that film was by Newman. Listening to the sarcastic Morgan's brash broadcasts, the \"Mad\" staff took note and reworked the name into Neuman, as later recalled by Kurtzman:\n\nWhen \"Mad\" was sued for copyright infringement by a woman claiming to hold the rights to the image, the magazine argued that it had copied the picture from various materials dating back to 1911 (which pre-dated the plaintiff's own claim). The lawsuit was unsuccessful, and the boy's face is now permanently associated with \"Mad\"—so much so, in fact, that according to \"Mad\" writer Frank Jacobs, the US Post Office once delivered a letter to the \"Mad\" offices bearing only a picture of Neuman, without any other address or identifying features.\n\nIn 2008, Eastern Michigan University held an exhibit and symposium on the evolution of Neuman images, dating back to 1877.\n\nSeveral pre–\"New Boy\" images that bear some resemblance to Neuman have also been identified. A number may be seen on John Adcock's \"Mysteries of Melvin\" blog-posting and another at leconcombre.com. The earlier images, however, do not share the missing teeth/tooth or the head-and-shoulders framing and head-on pose.\n\nIn 2012, longtime editor Nick Meglin offered a streamlined, exasperated version of Neuman's origins:\nOver the decades, Neuman has frequently been referenced in outside media, and his face has often appeared in political cartoons as a shorthand for unquestioning stupidity. During the administration of United States President George W. Bush, Neuman's features were frequently merged with those of Bush by editorial cartoonists such as Mike Luckovich and Tom Tomorrow. The image has also appeared on magazine covers, notably \"The Nation\". A large Bush/Neuman poster was part of the Washington protests that accompanied Bush's 2001 inauguration. The alleged resemblance between the two has been noted more than once by Hillary Clinton. On July 10, 2005, speaking at the Aspen Institute's Ideas Festival, she said, \"I sometimes feel that Alfred E. Neuman is in charge in Washington,\" referring to Bush's purported \"What, me worry?\" attitude. At the October 2008 Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, then-Presidential candidate Barack Obama joked, \"It's often been said that I share the politics of Alfred E. Smith and the ears of Neuman.\" Neuman's features have also been compared to others in the public eye, including Prince Charles, Ted Koppel, Oliver North and David Letterman.\n\nFreas painted the August 1971 cover of \"National Lampoon\" which merged Neuman's features with those of the court-martialed Vietnam War murderer William Calley, complete with the phrase, 'What, My Lai?\" However, Neuman's motto has also been referenced in a non-pejorative fashion, as at the Woodstock Music Festival in 1969. Jimi Hendrix spoke to the audience about the various changes of personnel in his band, and their lack of rehearsal time, while saying \"What, me worry?\" The tenth \"American Idol\" winner, Scotty McCreery, has a striking resemblance to Neuman. When judge Steven Tyler pointed this out on the show, McCreery replied, \"What, me worry?\"\n\nIn an extended sequence of the comic strip \"Peanuts\" from 1973 (later recreated in the 1983 TV special \"It's An Adventure, Charlie Brown\"), Charlie Brown becomes so obsessed with baseball that everything round starts looking like a baseball to him. Soon his own round head develops a rash that makes the back of his skull look like a baseball, and he starts wearing a paper bag on his head to hide it. Ironically, while hidden from view, his popularity and respect increase. He is referred to by the other campers as \"Mr. Sack\" or \"Sack\", but is also voted camp president and is widely admired. The rash eventually fades from his head, but Charlie Brown still fears that the next round thing he expects to see—a sunrise—may continue to look like a baseball. When the sun does rise, it instead looks like Neuman, with a halo reading: \"What! Me Worry?\"! \n\nNeuman also appeared as a sight gag in the March 27, 1967 installment of the comic strip \"Beetle Bailey\", as an inspector general. He can also be spotted in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #300, helping Peter Parker and Mary Jane move into their new house, while saying, \"Darn! I'm missing the Nets game! That makes me Mad!\" Similarly, when, in 1959's \"Superman\" #126, Superman decides to test Lois Lane by removing a rubber Superman mask in order to reveal his \"real\" identity, his identity is none other than Neuman. DC Comics' \"Emperor Joker\" storyline includes a cult that worships a deity named Alfred E.; the high priest of this cult wears a mask identical to Neuman's face.\n\nNeuman and \"Mad\" have been referenced several times on the animated series \"The Simpsons\". In the episode \"Marge in Chains\", Marge is arrested and in prison she meets an inmate called Tattoo Annie who has a fold-in tattoo that reveals Neuman with the text: \"What me Worry?\". The original phrase was \"What kind of slime would I marry?\". In the episode \"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\", Bart comes into contact with Neuman during a visit to the \"Mad\" offices. Neuman demands to see \"Kaputnik and Fonebone\" (which are references to deceased long-time \"Mad\" artists Dave Berg and Don Martin, respectively) for their work on \"New Kids on the Blecch\" (which would later become the title of another episode), and requests some \"furshlugginer pastrami sandwiches\". An awestruck Bart announces that he will \"never wash these eyes again\". In the episode \"New Kids on the Blecch\", Bart's boy band is booked to play a gig on an aircraft carrier, but their band manager plots to use the craft's weaponry to destroy the \"Mad\" offices when he discovers the magazine plans to publish a defamatory article about the band. \"Mad\"'s New York headquarters were depicted as a skyscraper similar to the Chrysler Building with a giant three-dimensional replica of Neuman's head mounted on the roof. In the episode \"Father Knows Worst\", Homer and Bart visit a hobby shop which includes an Aurora model-style kit of Neuman holding several protest signs.\n\nIn a segment of his 1958 television special, Fred Astaire danced while wearing a rubber Neuman mask. \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" made multiple references to Neuman, including episode #602 featuring \"Invasion U.S.A.\" Upon seeing director Alfred E. Green's name in the film's opening credits, Crow T. Robot, in a slightly idiotic tone, riffs \"What? Me direct?\" An animated 1996 sketch on \"MADtv\" combining \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" with \"The Godfather\" was credited to \"Alfred E. Puzo\" and \"Francis E. Neuman\".\n\nAnother homage to the name was \"Al Freddy Newham\", as used on the cover of the April 1967 issue of the amateur radio enthusiast's \"73 Magazine\", preparing to ineptly solder the frayed cord of a soldering gun with the same damaged gun. Neuman appears briefly, in clay animated form, in Jimmy Picker's 1983 stop motion animated film, \"Sundae in New York\". He also makes a cameo in the 1988 Daffy Duck cartoon \"The Night of the Living Duck\". A doodle of Neuman appears on a soldier's helmet in Oliver Stone's 1986 Vietnam film \"Platoon\". Lyrically, Neuman is invoked by the Beastie Boys on their song \"Shadrach\". A 1980 \"Password Plus\" episode featured Neuman's name as an answer, using the clues \"Freckles\", \"Mad\", \"Magazine\", \"Cover\", and \"Kid\". (Elaine Joyce solved the puzzle after \"Cover\"). He can be glimpsed holding a fish on the cover of the album \"Slow Motion\" by Man.\n\nA statue of Neuman can be found at the Dort Mall in Flint, Michigan.\n\n"}
{"id": "473914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=473914", "title": "Amateur television", "text": "Amateur television\n\nAmateur television (ATV) is the transmission of broadcast quality video and audio over the wide range of frequencies of radio waves allocated for radio amateur (Ham) use. ATV is used for non-commercial experimentation, pleasure, and public service events. Ham TV stations were on the air in many cities before commercial television stations came on the air. Various transmission standards are used, these include the broadcast transmission standards of NTSC in North America and Japan, and PAL or SECAM elsewhere, utilizing the full refresh rates of those standards. ATV includes the study of building of such transmitters and receivers, and the study of radio propagation of signals travelling between transmitting and receiving stations.\n\nATV is an extension of amateur radio. It is also called HAM TV or fast-scan TV (FSTV), as opposed to slow-scan television (SSTV). SSTV is a method of transmitting still images over radio, when it is not possible to send video.\nIn North America, amateur radio bands that are suitable for a television signal (wide enough to fit such a signal) are higher in frequency than VHF broadcast TV. The lowest frequency ham band suitable for television transmission is 70 centimeters, which is between broadcast channels 13 and 14. While outside of broadcast television channels, this frequency falls into CATV frequencies, on channels 57 to 61 (IRC) (420–450 MHz). As such, ATV transmissions can be viewed by setting a television or analog cable-box to cable input and attaching an outdoor antenna. For more sensitive reception, some users may use a purposely-built ATV down-converter, which is a kind of set-top-box. Other bands are also used for ATV, most of them in the UHF region on frequencies higher than UHF broadcast TV. 33 centimeters and 23 centimeters are two other commonly used bands for ATV, but reception of these higher bands requires the use of a down-converter.\n\nMost ATV signals are transmitted in either amplitude modulation (AM) or vestigial sideband (VSB) NTSC (North American analog TV broadcast modulation standard). DSB AM and VSB AM signals are inherently compatible with each other, and most televisions can receive either. DSB-AM signals consists of the carrier and both upper and lower sidebands. VSB-AM is where DSB-AM is filtered and the lower sideband is highly attenuated at frequencies more than 1.25 MHz from the carrier signal. A VSB filter can be added to a DSB-AM transmitter to make it a VSB signal. The filters, depending on power usage, will cost anywhere from US$100–1,000. For practical reasons, most individual ATV users transmit in DSB-AM, and VSB is transmitted by repeater stations. On the 33 cm and higher bands, frequency modulation (FM) ATV may be used, and on the SHF and EHF ham bands, FM is more commonly used than VSB or AM. FM ATV is incompatible with AM/VSB ATV, and a separate demodulator is necessary to receive signals.\n\nThe 2-meter band (144-148 MHz), while too narrow in bandwidth for an analog video signal, is often used by ATV operators for coordination with each other via FM voice transmissions. Operators seeking an ATV contact might first attempt calling on a regionally recognized ATV liaison-frequency, commonly 144.34 MHz, then agree to an ATV frequency to use for the video transmissions. The 2 meter frequency may be used throughout the contact to talk back to the current station transmitting video. The receiving station(s) may suggest adjustments the sending station can make, such as antenna direction, to improve the quality of the video received. The band lies within cable channel 18.\n\nThe 70-centimeter band (420-450 MHz) is the most commonly used ham band for ATV. Signals transmitted on this band usually propagate longer distances than on higher frequency bands, for a given transmitter power and antenna gain. The band falls between broadcast TV channels 13 and 14, which are 210–216 MHz and 470–476 MHz respectively. Propagation is similar to the lowest UHF TV Broadcast channels.\n\nAdditionally, this band can be easily received by simply tuning any cable-ready analog television or cable-box to the cable TV channels below and connecting an outdoor TV antenna. Amateur TV signals are much weaker than broadcast TV, so a preamplifier is often used to improve reception.\n\nUsage notes:\n\nThe 33-centimeter band (902-928 MHz) is next highest frequency ham band available for ATV in North America. This ham band is unique to ITU Region 2, and it is rarely available for amateur use in ITU Regions 1 or 3. This band is also shared with many users, including ISM devices and unlicensed Part 15 users, so interference issues are more likely than on other bands.\n\nThese channels can be received by many newer analog cable-boxes and televisions, which can tune to channels above 125.\n\nUsage notes:\n\nAdditionally 33 cm is the lowest frequency band on which higher-quality frequency modulated amateur TV occurs. This format gives better picture quality than standard AM television. The FM television format used is identical to big dish analog satellite television and can be received by some tuners which can tune this low in frequency. Otherwise a specialized FM amateur TV receiver is needed.\n\nThe 23-centimeter band (1240-1300 MHz) is the third highest frequency band available for ATV. Analog big-dish satellite television (TVRO) receivers may be re-purposed for inexpensively receiving ATV in this band. Such receivers can decode FM television when an outdoor antenna is connected to the LNB input. Due to the low cost and ease of repurposing old analog satellite receivers, this is the most popular band for FM amateur TV.\n\nCommonly used 23 cm FM channels:\n\nThis band is also used for AM/VSB television, although this requires a specialized receiver.\n\nUsage notes:\n\nIn addition to the above, there are other ham bands which are less commonly used for ATV:\n\n\nThe distance record for ATV is between Hawaii and California (2518 miles) on 434 MHz.\n\nExperiments with digital modes have lagged somewhat behind those in Europe, but have taken on some new urgency given the transition of broadcast television. WR8ATV currently has an output using DVB-S, which is believed to be the first DATV repeater in the US.\n\nThere is now a DATV downlink on the ISS operating in the amateur 2.4 GHz band.\n\nIn Europe, which generally has a narrower 70 cm allocation than the USA, the majority of amateur television operation is currently frequency modulated on and above. The frequencies in use depend on national permissions. In most of mainland Europe, the most common frequency is 1255 MHz. Other bands commonly used for ATV are the 13cm () and 3-cm () bands, although ATV is used on most of the microwave bands.\n\nIn several countries cross-band repeaters are used, with AM inputs on 430 MHz and FM outputs on , others have FM-ATV inputs on and outputs on .\n\nIn the United Kingdom, much activity occurs using in-band repeaters. These generally have an input of 1248, 1249 or 1255 MHz and typically output at 1308, 1312 or 1316 MHz, although other frequencies are also used. Simplex operation occurs on these or other frequencies chosen to avoid interference with other users of the band, e.g. . Recent experiments have been done with digital modes following widely adopted DVB-S and DVB-T standards. These new DATV transmissions need less spectrum bandwidth than FM-ATV and offer superior picture quality. However, the unavoidable processing delays caused by the temporal compression mean that DATV signals have a second or more of time lag, which can make real-time video conversations feel much less natural than the 'instantaneous' analogue system.\n\nTypically frequency modulated TV is used on frequencies above 1,240 MHz (1.24 GHz), where there is enough bandwidth for such wideband transmissions. This is often used as a repeater's input frequency, with output being standard VSB on the four channels listed above.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nThe quality of transmission is expressed as a \"p level\"; \"p\" standing for \"picture\". P levels range from zero to five, increasing as the picture becomes more viewable. P-0 signifies a state in which sync bars are visible, but the picture is too snowy to be seen; this occurs at a minimum signal strength of 3 dB. Each level represents an increase of 6 dB over the previous; P-5 is 30 dB above P-0 and represents a perfectly clear picture.\n\nAs transmission frequency increases, atmospheric path losses become greater, particularly at frequencies above 10 GHz. Additionally, long-distance propagation by F-layer ionospheric skip over the horizon does not typically occur at higher frequencies, and terrain and man-made structures can affect propagation of signals, blocking or redirecting signals. Factors such as E-layer skip propagation, tropospheric enhancement, and knife-edge diffraction can extend the useful range of signals.\n\nContent produced by ATV has included:\n\n\n\n"}

It is part of the \"Asphalt\" series. It was released on June 21, 2012 for the iOS and marks the first time in the series that a game is the same for both the iPhone and iPad. The game was launched for Android on June 25, for BlackBerry 10 on February 21, 2013, for Windows Phone 8 on February 27, for BlackBerry PlayBook on April 3, and for Windows 8 (via Windows Store) on August 22., Windows 10 on July 29, 2015. The game was pulled from the app stores at an unknown date.\n\nGameplay in \"Asphalt 7\" is very similar to that of previous games in the \"Asphalt\" series, with the player given the option of tilting the device, touching the side of the screen, or using an onscreen virtual steering-wheel to steer. The game also has an online multiplayer mode, both local through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and global through an internet connection.\n\nThe five star rating system for each race, the use of primary and secondary objectives and the \"Adrenaline mode\" from \"\" have all been retained in \"Asphalt 7\".\n\nThere are 80 licensed cars available in the game, divided into 7 tiers. The player starts with one car in each tier; the Abarth 500 ESSEESSE (Tier 1), the BMW 1 Series M Coupé (Tier 2), the Dodge Challenger SRT8 (Tier 3), the Cadillac CTS-V Coupé (Tier 4), the Nissan GT-R (Tier 5), the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 (Tier 6) and the Ruf Rt 12 S (Tier 7).\n\nOther cars to become available as the player progresses include, in Tier 1, the Range Rover Evoque, DeLorean DMC-12, Mercedes-Benz Classe C Coupé and Tesla Roadster; in Tier 2, the Plymouth Prowler, Chevrolet Camaro GS, Dodge Charger SRT8 Police and Lotus Exige S; in Tier 3, the Lotus Evora S, BMW M6 Coupé, Alfa Romeo 8C and Lamborghini Sesto Elemento; in Tier 4, the Dodge Viper ACR-X, Lamborghini Countach 25th Anniversary, Ferrari California and Mazda Furai; in Tier 5, the Cadillac CTS-V Coupé Race Car, Ferrari 458 Italia, Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Spyder Performante, Marussia B2 and Ferrari 575M Maranello; in Tier 6, the McLaren MP4-12C, Ferrari Enzo, Lamborghini Reventón and Aston Martin One-77; and in Tier 7, the Ferrari 288 GTO, Ruf CTR3, McLaren F1 and Bugatti Veyron Super Sport. The fastest car available to the player is the Koenigsegg Agera R (Tier 7)\n\nDue to Electronic Arts' ownership of the Porsche license, there are no Porsche vehicles, although there are tuned variants by Ruf.\n\n\"Asphalt 7\" features almost all of the locations from \"Asphalt 6: Adrenaline\", as well as adding new tracks, forming a total of 15 tracks. The locations are New York, Hawaii, Havana, Los Angeles, Nassau, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo, Moscow, New Orleans, Reykjavík, London, Alps, Shanghai and Miami.\n\nUpon its release, \"Asphalt 7\" received generally favorable reviews. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 83 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on seventeen reviews, and a score of 81% on GameRankings, based on seven reviews.\n\nIGN's George Roush was enthusiastic about the game, awarding a score of 8 out of 10, and concluding \"If you're as much of a fan of the \"Asphalt\" series as I am then you're going to love \"Heat\". It's nice to see that Gameloft is improving each entry while managing to keep the cost low. Race junkies are going to love looking for shortcuts, catching air and blasting their way through the beautiful looking tracks to the sound of energetic techno music.\" TouchGen's Dave LeClair was also impressed, scoring the game 4 out of 5; \"Overall, this is a great racing game. It has a couple of minor flaws, but nothing gamebreaking. The social sharing hooks after every race can be a little annoying, and they delay the time getting to the next race. Still, slight problems aside, fans of racing games will enjoy the total package offered in \"Asphalt 7: Heat\".\" Lisa Caplan of 148Apps also scored it 4 out of 5, praising the graphics and controls, although criticizing the gameplay as being very similar to its predecessors; \"for the price \"Asphalt 7\" is one of the best arcade racers on iOS. What it lacks in originality it makes up for in polish.\"\n\nSlide to Play's Nadia Oxford was somewhat less impressed, feeling the game wasn't differentiated enough from the previous games in the series, an argument Andrew Podolsky had made in his review of \"Asphalt 6\" for the site. As with both \"Asphalt 5\" and \"Asphalt 6\", the game was scored 3 out of 4. Oxford wrote \"The \"Asphalt\" series needs someone to open the windows and let some fresh air in, but it's still impossible to go really go wrong with \"Asphalt 7: Heat\". If you're still happy with \"Asphalt 6\" and you want to save that dollar for ice cream, go ahead and hang onto \"Adrenaline\". You'll live without \"Heat\". But if you don't own an \"Asphalt\" game, or if any upgrades to the series makes you happy, regardless of how small those upgrades are, go ahead and grab \"Asphalt 7: Heat\". It's still money well-spent.\" \"MacLife\"s Matt Clark scored the game 3 out of 5, also criticizing its similarity to earlier games in the series, but praising the graphics; \"if there's one way that \"Asphalt 7\" improves the series, it's the visual presentation. The vehicles and environments look fantastic on the Retina Display.\"\n\nRyan Whitwam of AndroidPolice was less enthused and was heavily critical of several aspects, such as the need to be online for the game to work, the use of real world money and, especially, the graphics; \"the deal breaker for me is the overwhelming mediocrity of the graphics. Judging from the screenshots on the Play Store page, this should be a gorgeous game. Instead, it's just average. Even then, only on some devices. On the Nexus 7 the texture resolution is absolutely terrible. Everything in the environment looks muddy. The cars aren't bad, but there is noticeable aliasing along the edges.\" Wired.com's Ryan Rigney was even more critical, scoring the game 6 out of 10 and criticising the implementation of in-app purchases; \"I can't imagine anyone ever spending money on them. Even if you buy the $100 pack of 200 stars, that still won't unlock everything in the game; not by a long shot. So what's the point?\" Rigney did however, praise the graphics, arguing that the game has a \"polish that would be impressive for an Xbox Live Arcade game. No other arcade racer on the App Store comes close to matching \"Asphalt 7\"s presentation quality.\"\n\nTech blogger Thomas Baekdal calculated that \"unlocking everything in the game will cost you almost $3,500.\"\n"}

In this episode, the \"Enterprise\" discovers a derelict centuries-old alien battlecruiser and becomes trapped along with it.\n\nWhile the Federation starship \"Enterprise\", under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, investigates the asteroid-laden sector of space of the final battle between the Menthars and the Promellians, it receives a distress call from a Promellian battlecruiser: Captain Picard directs the ship to investigate. They find the ancient battlecruiser adrift but intact, and Picard, anxious to see the ship for himself, joins the away team as they transport over. They find the crew - all long dead, but still at their posts - while a recording by their captain suggests the ship was caught in a Menthar trap. With their investigation complete, the away team returns to the \"Enterprise\" to continue on, when they begin to suffer a series of power losses that prevent the use of either impulse or warp drive, and are bombarded by radiation that threatens to drain their shields and kill the crew. Picard orders Chief Engineer La Forge to find a way to restore power while a second away team searches for more clues on the Promellian vessel. They discover that the Menthars had previously used aceton assimilators to absorb an enemy ship's energy and redirect it back as hazardous radiation, and that the \"Enterprise\" is stuck in the same trap.\n\nLa Forge realizes that the only way to restore power is to reconfigure the warp drive and traces the warp drive's design back to the \"Enterprise\"s construction and blueprints created by Dr. Leah Brahms. La Forge enters the ship's holodeck to help figure through the engine reconfiguration, whereupon the computer takes an off the cuff remark by Geordi literally and creates a holographic representation of Brahms herself to assist him in his work. As Geordi does so, he asks the computer to update the hologram with Dr. Brahms' personality profile, and slowly gains romantic feelings for her. Despite the holo-Brahms' help, La Forge is unable to find a way to safely maneuver the \"Enterprise\" away, and when Picard orders all extraneous power systems (including the holodeck) shut down to conserve power, La Forge convinces the captain to allow the holodeck to continue to run.\n\nAfter power is restored, the simulated Dr. Brahms recognizes a solution which is to allow the computer to take control of the ship, allowing it to make rapid adjustments to compensate for the trap. La Forge then finds an alternate solution to the problem which is to completely reduce the power output from the \"Enterprise\" and maneuver it out of the field by manual control with only two thrusters. Picard and La Forge decide that computers cannot account for human intuition and elect to go with the manual approach. Picard takes the helm himself to skilfully carry out the operation, successfully moving the \"Enterprise\" from the trap. Once free and with power restored, the \"Enterprise\" destroys the Promellian craft to prevent others from falling into the trap.\n\n\n\n"}

The musical toured the US in 1995 but did not open on Broadway.\n\nBrothers Robert and Richard Sherman had written the scores to several Disney movies such as \"Mary Poppins\" and \"The Jungle Book\". In the mid 1960s, Disney staff scriptwriter, AJ Carothers rediscovered the motion picture \"St. Martin's Lane\" and approached the Sherman brothers with the idea of purchasing the rights to the film and making a stage musical out it. The Shermans and AJ Carothers did just that in 1969, writing the musical \"Piccadilly\". But nothing more became of it until 1982 when interest was rekindled, and the project was rewritten and renamed, \"Blow Us a Kiss\". Still, nothing happened with the property until later in the same decade when interest was again sparked, and Tommy Tune became attached to the show.\n\nWith a major Broadway star behind the project, the show was finally launched in 1995 with yet a new name: \"Busker Alley\". The musical opened in April 1995 at the Macauley Theatre, Louisville, Kentucky as the start of a 16-city tour. It starred Tune and Darcie Roberts, Brent Barrett, Marcia Lewis, and The Huber Marionettes. Jeff Calhoun directed and choreographed, and sets were by Tony Walton.\n\nThe producers planned to bring the production to Broadway in November 1995 at the St. James Theatre. Artist LeRoy Neiman created a 40-foot mural for \"Busker Alley\" on the façade of the theater, and the cast performed a number from the show at the 1995 Tony Awards ceremony. The production had numerous setbacks during the tour as well as two more name changes, including \"Stage Door Charley\" (unilaterally chosen by the producer's wife). The show finished its pre-Broadway tour as \"Buskers\". \"The New York Times\" reported on September 1, 1995: \"Neither show [\"Victor, Victoria\" and \"Busker\"] received unqualified raves during months-long out-of-town tryouts, but judging from the reviews, the problems on \"Busker,\" in which Mr. Tune plays a street entertainer in prewar London, were more severe. Last month, the show returned to New York to put in the rewrites by Peter Stone, and for a retooling by Mr. Tune, whose associate Jeff Calhoun directed and choreographed the show.\n\nSix weeks prior to moving to New York City, Tune broke his foot during one of the performances in Tampa, Florida. Although Tune's foot would have healed in time, the investors pulled out. The tour ended on October 8, 1995 in Tampa.\n\nIn 2003 AJ Carothers and the Sherman Brothers revised their book and song score, changing the name back to \"Busker Alley\".\nOn November 13, 2006 the York Theatre Company presented a one-night-only benefit concert performance of \"Busker Alley\" at the Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College. Jim Dale starred as \"Charlie Baxter\". Glenn Close appeared as \"Dame Libby St. Albans\" framing the show's main plot. (Dale and Close originated the roles of P.T. Barnum and his wife, Charity Barnum, in \"Barnum\" in 1980.) Also in the cast were: Jessica Grové, George S. Irving, Simon Jones, Noah Racey, John Bolton, Robert Fitch, Anne Rogers, Michael Lane Trautman, Cristy Candler, Diane Wasnak and Bonzer the dog. Tony Walton directed the production, with Lisa Shriver as choreographer. Aaron Gandy was the conductor, and Mark York the pianist. A CD of the performance was recorded on Jay Records.\n\n\"Busker Alley\" had been announced for a Broadway production for the 2008-09 season, with Tony Walton as director and designer and Jim Dale to star. In December 2008, the producers announced that the musical would be delayed. On August 25, 2009, the producers announced that they all were leaving the production, and, in a statement said (in part), \"We will be returning all of the money to our investors and release all of our sponsors from their obligations.\"\n\nA CD which recreated this performance was released by Jay Records in 2007.\n\n\n"}

Originally a sporadic series airing on Saturday mornings, Sunday afternoons, or weekday afternoons beginning in February 1967, it became a regularly scheduled program in 1971 on the CBS Saturday-morning lineup, running one hour with some films apparently edited down to fit the time slot. The program was hosted by 1950s television act \"Kukla, Fran and Ollie\", a.k.a. puppeteer Burr Tillstrom and actress Fran Allison.\n\nKukla, Fran and Ollie were dropped from the series in 1977 and the program was renamed \"CBS Saturday Film Festival\". In 1978 CBS canceled the show in favor of the youth-targeted magazine \"30 Minutes\" which was modeled after its adult sister show \"60 Minutes\". CBS canceled \"30 Minutes\" in 1982 and brought back \"Saturday Film Festival\" which ran for two seasons until CBS cancelled it for good in 1984.\n\nPerhaps the most famous \"episode\" of the series was the 1960 British film \"Hand in Hand\", the story of a deep friendship between two elementary school students, one a Roman Catholic boy and the other a Jewish girl.\n\nIn addition to many American and British films, the series also featured motion pictures from Russia, France, Bulgaria, Japan, Sweden, Italy, China, Australia, South Africa, and Czechoslovakia, as well as several other countries.\n\nOther films that aired during the series run include the Academy Awarding-winning French film \"The Red Balloon\"' \"Skinny and Fatty\" from Japan; \"Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World\" from Great Britain; \"Tillie, the Unhappy Hippopotamus\" from Czechoslovakia; and \"Mi-Mi, the Lazy Kitten\" from China.\n\nActor Ray Bolger, a star of \"The Wizard of Oz\", served as narrator for some of the episodes during the show's 1980s run.\n\nFollowing is a partial list of films aired on the program:\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\n"}

{"id": "11196230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11196230", "title": "Coon song", "text": "Coon song\n\nCoon songs were a genre of music that presented a stereotyped image of black people. They were popular in the United States and the United Kingdom from around 1880 to 1920, though the earliest such songs date from minstrel shows as far back as 1848.\n\nThe first explicitly coon-themed song, published in 1880, may have been \"The Dandy Coon's Parade\" by J.P. Skelley. Other notable early coon songs included \"The Coons Are on Parade\", \"New Coon in Town\" (by J.S. Putnam, 1883), \"Coon Salvation Army\" (by Sam Lucas, 1884), \"Coon Schottische\" (by William Dressler, 1884).\n\nBy the mid-1880s, coon songs were a national craze; over 600 such songs were published in the 1890s. The most successful songs sold millions of copies. To take advantage of the fad, composers \"add[ed] words typical of coon songs to previously published songs and rags\". \n\nAfter the turn of the century, coon songs began to receive criticism for their racist content. In 1905, Bob Cole, an African-American composer who had gained fame largely by writing coon songs, made somewhat unprecedented remarks about the genre. When asked in an interview about the name of his earlier comedy \"A Trip to Coontown\", he replied, \"That day has passed with the softly flowing tide of revelations.\" Following further criticism the use of \"coon\" in song titles greatly decreased after 1910.\n\nOn August 13, 1920, the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League created the Red, Black and Green flag as a response to the song \"Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon\" by Heelan and Helf. That song along with \"Coon, Coon, Coon\" and \"All Coons Look Alike to Me\" were identified by H.L. Mencken as being the songs which firmly established the derogatory term \"coon\" in the American vocabulary. Originally in the 1830s, the term had been associated with the Whig Party. The Whigs used a raccoon as its emblem, but also had a more tolerant attitude towards blacks than the other political factions. The latter opinion is likely what transformed the term \"coon\" from mere political slang into a racial slur.\n\nIt is possible that the popularity of coon songs may be explained in part by their historical timing: coon songs arose precisely as the popular music business exploded in Tin Pan Alley. However, James Dormon, a former professor of history and American studies at the University of Southwestern Louisiana, has also suggested that coon songs can be seen as \"a necessary sociopsychological mechanism for justifying segregation and subordination.\" The songs portrayed Blacks as posing a threat to the American social order, and implied that they had to be controlled.\n\nAt the height of their popularity, \"just about every songwriter in the country\" was writing coon songs \"to fill the seemingly insatiable demand\". Writers of coon songs included some of the most important Tin Pan Alley composers, including Gus Edwards, Fred Fisher (who wrote the 1905 \"If the Man in the Moon Were a Coon\", which sold three million copies), and Irving Berlin. Even one of John Philip Sousa's assistants, Arthur Pryor, composed coon songs. (This was meant to ensure a steady supply to Sousa's band, which performed the songs and popularized several coon song melodies.)\n\nMany coon songs were written by whites, but some were written by African-Americans. Important black composers of coon songs include Ernest Hogan (who wrote \"All Coons Look Alike to Me\", the most famous coon song); Sam Lucas (who wrote the most racist early coon songs by modern standards); minstrel and songwriter Sidney L. Perrin (who wrote \"Black Annie,\" \"Dat's De Way to Spell Chicken,\" \"Mamma's Little Pumpkin Colored Coons,\" \"Gib Me Ma 15 cents,\" and \"My Dinah\"); Bob Cole (who wrote dozens of songs, including \"I Wonder What The Coon's Game Is?\" and \"No Coons Allowed\"); and Bert Williams and George Walker. Even classic ragtime composer Scott Joplin wrote at least one coon song (\"I Am Thinking of my Pickaninny Days\"), and may have composed the music for several more, using lyrics written by others.\n\nCoon songs almost always aimed to be funny and incorporated the syncopated rhythms of ragtime music. A coon song's defining characteristic, however, was its caricature of African Americans. In keeping with the older minstrel image of blacks, coon songs often featured \"watermelon- and chicken-loving rural buffoon[s]\". However, \"blacks began to appear as not only ignorant and indolent, but also devoid of honesty or personal honor, given to drunkenness and gambling, utterly without ambition, sensuous, libidinous, even lascivious.\" Blacks were portrayed as making money through gambling, theft, and hustling, rather than working to earn a living, as in the Nathan Bivins song \"Gimme Ma Money\":\n\n<poem>Last night I did go to a big Crap game,\nHow dem coons did gamble wuz a sin and a shame...\nI'm gambling for my Sadie,\nCause she's my lady,\nI'm a hustling coon, ... dat's just what I am.</poem>\n\nCoon songs portrayed blacks as \"hot\", in this context meaning promiscuous and libidinous. They suggested that the most common living arrangement was a \"honey\" relationship (unmarried cohabitation), rather than marriage.\n\nBlacks were portrayed as inclined toward acts of provocative violence. Razors were often featured in the songs and came to symbolize blacks' wanton tendencies. However, violence in the songs was uniformly directed at blacks instead of whites (perhaps to discharge the threatening notion of black violence amongst the coon songs' predominantly white consumers). Hence, the spectre of black-on-white violence remained but an allusion. The street-patrolling \"bully coon\" was often used as a stock character in coon songs.\n\nThe songs showed the social threats that whites believed were posed by blacks. Passing was a common theme, and blacks were portrayed as seeking the status of whites, through education and money. However, blacks rarely, except during dream sequences, actually succeeded at appearing white; they only aspired to do so.\n\nCoon songs were popular in vaudeville theater, where they were delivered by \"coon shouters\", who were typically White females. Notable coon shouters included Artie Hall, Sophie Tucker, May Irwin, Mae West, Fanny Brice, Fay Templeton, Lotta Crabtree, Marie Dressler, Emma Carus, Nora Bayes, Clarice Vance, Elsie Janis, Trixie Friganza, Eva Tanguay and Julia Gerity. \n\nAs with minstrel shows earlier, a whole genre of skits and shows grew up around coon songs, and often coon songs were featured in legitimate theater productions.\n\nCoon songs contributed to the development and acceptance of authentic African-American music. Elements from coon songs were incorporated into turn-of-the-century African American folk songs, as was revealed by Howard W. Odum's 1906-1908 ethnomusicology fieldwork. Similarly, coon songs lyrics influenced the vocabulary of the blues, culminating with Bessie Smith's singing in the 1920s.\n\nBlack songwriters and performers who participated in the creation of coon songs profited commercially, enabling them to go on to develop a new type of African American musical theater based at least in part on African-American traditions. Coon songs also contributed to the mainstream acceptance of ragtime music, paving the way for the acceptance of other African-American music. Ernest Hogan, when discussing his \"All Coons Look Alike to Me\" shortly before his death, commented:\n\nCoon songs became tremendously popular in Britain after the 1880s. The role of racial stereotyping in Britain was different from what it was in America, in that the theatre audiences listening to the song often did not see Black people on a day-to-day basis in their lives.\n\nIn Britain, the most important stars to popularize coon songs were Eugene Stratton, G. H. Elliott and G. H. Chirgwin. \"Coon imitators\" singing these songs were a staple part of British music-hall until at least 1920. Initially reserved to male artists; however, a small number of women and children increasingly began to sing coon songs at the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\n\n\n"}

The term was coined in the summer of 2005 by Cherry Lix, a burlesque solo artist based in San Francisco.\n\nThe first guerrilla burlesque event was performed with Cherry Lix's suggestion by Diamond Daggers, a San Francisco burlesque troupe, at Jim Sweeney's (Kingfish) 2005 birthday party at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco. The Kingfish is one of the largest burlesque producers in San Francisco. After the troupe was successful with the Kingfish, Daisy Delight suggested that they guerrilla the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence's Easter Picnic in the Park, a yearly event in San Francisco's Dolores Park. Later that fall, four members of Diamond Daggers \"guerrillaed\" on various street corners in the Castro, a popular gay neighborhood in San Francisco.\n\nIn February 2006, Cherry Lix and Daisy Delight started Twilight Vixen Revue, a new gay burlesque troupe, and they have continued the guerrilla burlesque tradition, most recently descending upon Miz Margo's birthday party at the DNA Lounge in July 2006.\n\nThis style of burlesque epitomizes the \"Neo-Burlesque\" or \"new burlesque\" style of performance, by taking traditional-styled burlesque performance and aggressively bringing it to unsuspecting, modern crowds.\n\n"}
{"id": "361217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=361217", "title": "Happy Days (play)", "text": "Happy Days (play)\n\nHappy Days is a play in two acts, written by Samuel Beckett.\n\nWinnie, buried to her waist, follows her daily routine and prattles to her husband, Willie, who is largely hidden and taciturn. Her frequent refrain is “Oh this \"is\" a happy day.” Later, in Act II she is buried up to her neck, but continues to talk and remember happier days.\n\nWinnie is embedded waist-deep in a low mound under blazing light, with a large black bag beside her. She is awakened by a piercing bell and begins her daily routine with a prayer. Talking incessantly to herself, she brushes her teeth, drinks the last of a bottle of tonic, and puts on her hat. She struggles to read the writing on the toothbrush. She awakens her husband Willie, who is hidden by the mound, and prattles to him. He occasionally responds with headlines from his newspaper, one of which reminds her of her first kiss. They both look at an apparently saucy postcard. Winnie explains that Willie’s listening enables her to go on talking, and is delighted when he responds even briefly to one of her many questions. From her bag she pulls out a revolver, recalls how Willie asked her to take it away from him, and puts it on the ground beside her. She puts up a parasol to protect her from the sun, but it catches fire. She finds a music box in her bag, to which Willie briefly sings. Winnie files her nails and remembers the last people who passed, a Mr. and Mrs. Shower (or perhaps Cooker), who asked what she was doing stuck in the ground. She prepares her bag for the night and instructs Willie on how to crawl backwards into his hole. Winnie wishes that he would come round and live where she could see him better.\n\nWinnie is now embedded up to her neck, still wearing her hat, still with the bag and revolver beside her. She is awakened by the bell, which rings again each time she falls back asleep. She senses that Willie is looking at her but cannot see him, and he does not respond to her calls. She continues to talk, recalling a time when a little girl called Mildred undressed her doll in the nursery at night, but is interrupted by anxiety about Willie and further memories of Mr. and Mrs. Shower. Willie crawls out from behind the mound, smartly dressed, which reminds her of the day he asked her to marry him. She encourages him as he tries to crawl up the mound towards her, and is delighted when he grunts \"Win\". She sings the music-box tune, a love song.\n\nWinnie is a \"woman of about fifty\", who passes her time between \"the bell for waking and the bell for sleep\" by following a very exact daily routine. in Act 1, after she methodically removes the items from her baga comb, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a bottle of patent medicine, lipstick, a nail file, a revolver and a music box. The routine is raised to the level of ceremony. Beckett's instructions to Billie Whitelaw in 1979 emphasize this:\n\nThe bag is all she has—look at it with affection … From the first you should know how she feels about it … When the bag is at the right height you peer in, see what things are there and then get them out. Peer, take, place. Peer, take, place. You peer more when you pick things up than when you put them down. Everything has its place.\n\nAt the end of the day she carefully collects her possessionsbar the gunand places them back in the bag. Winnie never plumbs (never dares plumb) the bottom (\"The depths in particular, who knows what treasures\"), so it is also her hope chest.\n\nThe items in her bag also have secondary functions, they serve as \"aides-mémoire\". But more, like Krapp’s tapes or Lucky’s bones they provide her with what Mary Doll describes as \"touchstones of existential meaning\". Winnie's perception of these objects connects her to the memories of specific days and important incidents within them.\n\nHer possessions are all wearing out or running out. At the start of Act I she takes the last swig of her medicine before throwing away the bottle, her toothbrush has hardly any hairs left and the lipstick, to use Beckett's expression, is \"visibly \"zu ende\"\", the parasol is faded with a \"mangy fringe\" and even her pearl necklace is \"more thread than pearls\".\n\nWinnie is the eternal optimistRobert Brustein called her a \"hopeful futilitarian\"but the available sources of her optimism are being used up and she has to work harder and harder to keep up her positive front which is already wafer-thin when we first meet her. Her effortful optimism is expressed in her carefully precise, self-correcting refrain, \"Oh this \"is\" a happy day, this will have been another happy day. After all. So far.\"\n\nBeckett described her as being \"like a bird\" and she makes every effort to rise above her predicament but she keeps getting pulled down. She never questions or explains why she finds herself in the predicament she is in, but her dream is that she will \"simply float up into the blue … And that perhaps some day the earth will yield and let me go, the pull is so great, yes, crack all round me and let me out.\"\n\nWillie is a man of \"about sixty\". In marked contrast to Winnie's loquacity, the henpecked Willie is laconic to a fault. In the whole of the second act Willie utters only one, barely audible monosyllabic word. Much of his dialogue consists of him reading notices from his paper; his responses to Winnie—when he can be bothered to respond at all—are terse and barely communicative. He functions mainly as something for her to talk at—being used as a stooge by the old music hall pro that Winnie is—\"just to know that in theory you can hear me though in fact you don't is all I need.\"\n\nHe keeps himself out of Winnie's gaze, only occasionally surfacing from his tunnel. His only interest is to bury himself, figuratively, in an old newspaper or erotic picture postcards, or literally, underground in his cave asleep and seemingly unaffected by the bell that jars Winnie.\n\nThere is a childlike, if not exactly innocent, quality to him and there are many times in the play one might think Winnie was talking to a young boy rather than a grown man. Winnie also serves as his protector, the custodian of \"Brownie\" the revolver she keeps safe from him in case he uses it on himself.\n\nWhereas Beckett aligns Winnie with a bird, albeit one with oil on its feathers, he likens Willie to a \"turtle\" although many of the metaphors in the play associate him with pigs:\n\n[I]n Act I Winnie speaks of envying \"the brute beast\" only a moment before Willie's \"hairy forearm\" appears above the mound; throughout the play Willie never rises to his feet, but crawls on all fours; and when Winnie notes that the bristles on her toothbrush are \"pure ... hog's ... setae\" Willie gives this comment a sexual dimension by revealing that a hog is a \"Castrated male swine.\" In context, this phrase seems to relate to Willie, since various hints are made that he has been metaphorically emasculated by his domineering wife.\n\nBeckett began the play on 8 October 1960 and the English version was completed on 14 May 1961. Beckett finished the translation into French by November 1962 but amended the title. In a moment of inspiration, he borrowed the title Oh les beaux jours, from Verlaine's poem, \"Colloque sentimental\".\n\nCyril Cusack claimed that \"Happy Days\" was, by Beckett's own admission, \"influenced\" by Cusack's wife, Maureen Cusack's request that he \"write a happy play\" after \"Krapp\".\n\nBeckett confided to Brenda Bruce what was going through his mind as he sat down to write the play:\n\nHe said: \"Well I thought that the most dreadful thing that could happen to anybody, would be not to be allowed to sleep so that just as you're dropping off there'd be a 'Dong' and you'd have to keep awake; you’re sinking into the ground alive and it's full of ants; and the sun is shining endlessly day and night and there is not a tree … there’s no shade, nothing, and that bell wakes you up all the time and all you've got is a little parcel of things to see you through life.\" He was referring to the life of the modern woman. Then he said: \"And I thought who would cope with that and go down singing, only a woman.\"\n\n\"Happy Days\" was first published by Grove Press in 1961 followed by Faber in 1963. By this stage in his writing career Beckett was becoming more aware of the importance of revising his work in actual performance and so wrote to Grove Press about \"Happy Days\" on 18 May 1961 to advise them that, \"I should prefer the text not to appear in any form before production and not in book form until I have seen some rehearsals in London. I can't be definitive without actual work done in the theatre.\"\n\nWinnie is embedded in a \"low mound\", \"the mother earth symbol to end all other mother earth symbols\". She lives in a deluge of never-ending light from which there is no escape: even the parasol she unfolds at one point ignites, leaving her without protection. We learn that she has not always been buried in this way but we never discover how she came to be trapped so.\n\nA number of suggestions have been put forth to explain where the idea for the original imagery originated. James Knowlson has suggested images from Luis Buñuel’s 1928 film, \"Un chien andalou\" or a photograph by Angus McBean of Frances Day.\n\nBeckett required the set to have \"a maximum of simplicity and symmetry\" with a \"very pompier trompe-l'oeil backcloth to represent unbroken plain and sky receding to meet in far distance\". \"What should characterise [the] whole scene, sky and earth\", he wrote, \"is a pathetic unsuccessful realism, the kind of tawdriness you get in a 3rd rate musical or pantomime, that quality of \"pompier\", laughably earnest bad imitation.\"\n\nThe scene is reminiscent of a seaside postcard with Winnie buried in the sand and Willie with his knotted handkerchief and his boater. The fake backdrop calls to mind also the kind used by photographers that feature a painted body on a sheet of wood with a hole cut out where the head belongs popular at holiday venues. Even the title of the play, \"Happy Days\", is the kind of expression typically used when reminiscing about these kinds of holidays. Of note is the fact that he worked on the play while in the English seaside resort of Folkestone during the two weeks he was obliged to be resident in the area before his marriage to Suzanne could officially take place.\n\nThe play is also reminiscent of the music hall. The boater Willie sports at a \"rakish angle\" places his character clearly in the music hall tradition as does his formal wear in the second half of the play. Historically boaters were fashionable headgear up till about the 1920s at which time sunbathing started to become fashionable; prior to this ladies would commonly be seen making use of parasols to protect their white skin from the sun's harmful rays.\n\nThis play, with Winnie embedded in the earth and Willie crawling on it, is evidently strange. \"Strangeness,\" Beckett informs us, \"was the necessary condition of the play of Winnie’s plight in the play.\" During Berlin rehearsals he said, \"In this play you have the combination of the strange and the practical, the mysterious and the factual. This is the crux of both the comedy and the tragedy of it.\"\n\nThe question of \"What does it mean?\" is voiced in the play by the passer-by Mr Shower (or Cooker). Beckett explained this in a letter to Alan Schneider:\n\nWinnie comments sourly, \"Usual drivel\". But Mrs Shower provides an oblique answer: \"What’s the idea of you, she says, what are you meant to mean?\".\n\nThe play resists answers. When Kay Boyle asked Beckett why Willie reaches up towards Winnie, he replied:\n\nNevertheless, the central metaphor is clear: Winnie is sinking inexorably in the slow sands of time and disappointment.\n\nThe two-act structure emphasises the passing of time. Act II is bleaker than Act I, and Winnie knows it: \"To have been what I always am – and so changed from what I was.\" By Act II she can no longer imagine any relief, and she can no longer pray, as she did at the play’s start. Although she still intones the phrase ‘happy day’, it no longer triggers her smile.\"\n\nThe play, like life, has a strong sexual undercurrent. “In the \"Happy Days\" of 1979, Beckett very particularly played upon the physical attractiveness of [Billie] Whitelaw … Where most Winnies, such as Peggy Ashcroft and Irene Worth, look rather matronly, Beckett made Whitelaw’s Winnie into a siren, with black, low cut gown, haunting eyes, exaggerated lipstick … a woman, who while not any longer young, still manifests a powerful erotic dimension.” Her memories often have a sexual edge: sitting on Charlie Hunter’s knees; her first kiss; the two balls; an encounter in a toolshed; when handed the erotic postcard from Willie, she takes time to examine it before returning it in feigned offense and the story she tells of the small girl Mildred’s (Beckett’s original name for Winnie) sexual curiosity is genuinely disturbing. A mouse, in Freudian terms, is a phallic symbol and Beckett’s protagonists often speak autobiographically in the third person. Also the doll wears a pearl necklet, as does she. It should not be taken from this that the terrified child (assuming the story is figurative) has become the frigid wife; she talks knowledgeably about sex and early drafts of the play even show how their sex life has dwindled over the years. It does appear that sexual relations between her and Willie – a common British euphemism for penis – have been lacking, at least from her perspective:\n\nPerhaps this is why she teases him with her recollection of other men, to bring him out both sexually and imaginatively. The play is full of sexual innuendo. \"And it is sex which is responsible for the contuation of the life that plunges man inevitably into suffering. The sexual innuendos contrast, then, with images of sterility or ‘discreation.’\"\n\nMany of the play’s jokes are plays on language. There is a running joke about the writing on Winnie’s toothbrush. She struggles to read it, starting with “pure”, and progressively seeing more adjectives but not the key noun. Finally learning that it is made of “hog’s setae”, she presses Willie to define “hog”. His definition (“Castrated male swine. Reared for slaughter”) encapsulates his plight. They ignore the more unusual word: “setae” are stiff bristles, whose purpose on a worm is to grip the surface and help the worm move without going backwards.\n\nWinnie struggles to recall quotations from the classics in contrast to Willie’s quotes from the popular press:\n\nSpeaking is Winnie's \"raison d'être\"; words flow from her in an endless stream. She uses \"clichés to insulate [herself] from the harshness of existence\". In Beckett’s texts, language conceals the world and provides comfort by insulating the individual. “Language generally in Beckett’s world is not a means of conveying meaning, but a balm for the sores of existence.”\n\nThe final song is the waltz duet, ‘I love you so’ from \"The Merry Widow\".\n\nThe first production was at the Cherry Lane Theatre, New York City on 17 September 1961, directed by Alan Schneider with Ruth White as Winnie (for which she won an Obie) and John C. Becher as Willie. The first London production was at the Royal Court Theatre on 1 November 1962 directed by George Devine and Tony Richardson with Brenda Bruce as Winnie and Peter Duguid as Willie.\n\nWhen \"Happy Days\" was first performed in London there were disagreements about every aspect of the text and production. Even Kenneth Tynan, one of the saviours of \"Godot\", felt that \"Happy Days\" was \"a metaphor extended beyond its capacity\", nevertheless, he admitted Beckett's strange, insinuating power and urged his readers to buy tickets for the play.\nMore recent revivals on stage have occurred in 2008 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City, directed by Deborah Warner and starring Fiona Shaw as Winnie and Tim Potter as Willie, in 2014 at the Young Vic, starring Juliet Stevenson, and in New York City (The Flea Theater) and Pasadena (Boston Court Theatre) in 2015 starring Tony Shaloub and Brooke Adams.\n\nIn 2016 The Yale Repertory Theatre mounted a production with Dianne Wiest as \"Winnie\" and Jarlath Conroy as \"Willie\", directed by James Bundy. That production subsequently transferred to downtown Brooklyn, New York's Theatre for a New Audience with Wiest and Conroy reprising their roles in April & May 2017.\n\nMaxine Peake will play the role of Winnie at the Royal Exchange Theatre in 2018, directed by Sarah Frankcom.\n\nThe film version of \"Happy Days\" was produced in 2001 as part of the Beckett on Film project. The film was directed by Patricia Rozema and starred Rosaleen Linehan as Winnie.\n\n"}

The film was nominated at the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and the 63rd British Academy Film Awards for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Production Design.\n\nLord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, kidnapping Ollivander from Diagon Alley and destroying the Millennium Bridge. The Malfoy family is disgraced when Lucius is apprehended and sent to Azkaban for his involvement with the Death Eaters. Voldemort instead chooses Draco to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco's mother Narcissa and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek help from Severus Snape, who claims to have been acting as a mole within the Order of the Phoenix all along. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.\n\nHarry Potter, now 16 years old, accompanies Albus Dumbledore from Surbiton to the village of Budleigh Babberton to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Slughorn, who has been in hiding, agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to The Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The three visit Fred and George Weasley's new joke shop at Diagon Alley and see Draco entering Knockturn Alley with a group of Death Eaters including Fenrir Greyback. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry hides in the Slytherin carriage using his Invisibility Cloak, but is spotted and petrified by Malfoy. Harry is found and saved by Luna Lovegood.\n\nAt Hogwarts, Harry and Ron borrow textbooks for Slughorn's Potions class, and Harry is stuck with a copy that turns out to be filled with helpful notes and spells left by the \"Half-Blood Prince\". Harry uses the book to excel in the class and impresses Slughorn, winning a Liquid Luck potion. Ron becomes Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team and forms a romantic relationship with Lavender Brown, upsetting Hermione. Harry consoles Hermione and admits that he now has feelings for Ron's younger sister, Ginny Weasley.\n\nHarry spends the Christmas holidays with the Weasleys. On Christmas Eve, Harry discusses his suspicions about Draco to the Order of the Phoenix. His suspicions are dismissed, but Arthur Weasley later tells Harry privately that the Malfoys may have been interested in a Vanishing Cabinet. Bellatrix and Greyback attack and burn down the Burrow, drawing Harry into a battle. He saves Ginny before the Order arrive and fight off the Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Dumbledore reveals to Harry that Slughorn possesses a memory of Voldemort that Dumbledore desperately needs. He asks Harry to confront Slughorn and retrieve the real memory, after being given an altered version that made it appear as though Slughorn did not know anything. Harry is unable to convince Slughorn.\n\nAfter Ron accidentally ingests a love potion intended for Harry, Harry cures him with Slughorn's help. The trio celebrate with mead that Slughorn had intended to gift to Dumbledore. The mead poisons Ron, and Harry is forced to save his life after Slughorn hesitates. Ron murmurs Hermione's name while recovering in the infirmary, causing Lavender to end their relationship. Harry confronts Draco about the mead and a cursed necklace, and the two duel. Harry uses a curse from the Half-Blood Prince's potion book to severely injure Malfoy, who is rescued and healed by Snape. Fearing the book may be filled with more Dark Magic, Ginny and Harry hide it in the Room of Requirement and share their first kiss.\n\nHarry decides to use his Liquid Luck potion to convince Slughorn to give up the memory Dumbledore needs. Harry views the memory with Dumbledore and learns that Voldemort wanted information for creating Horcruxes, magical objects that could contain pieces of a wizard's soul and make them immortal. Dumbledore concludes that Voldemort successfully divided his soul into seven pieces by creating six Horcruxes, two of which have already been destroyed: Tom Riddle's diary by Harry and Marvolo Gaunt's ring by him. The two travel to a seaside cave where Harry aids Dumbledore in drinking a potion that hides another Horcrux, Slytherin's locket.\n\nA weakened Dumbledore defends them from Inferi and apparates back to Hogwarts. Bellatrix, Greyback, and more Death Eaters enter Hogwarts with Draco's help through the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement that Draco managed to connect to the one he had been working on in Knockturn Alley. Dumbledore instructs Harry to hide and not interfere under any circumstance. Draco arrives in the Astronomy Tower and disarms Dumbledore revealing that he has been chosen by Voldemort to kill the headmaster. Snape arrives, and casts the killing curse on Dumbledore when Draco is unable to bring himself to do it, killing the Headmaster. He then overpowers Harry and reveals himself as the Half-Blood Prince before escaping.\n\nHarry returns to Hogwarts, where the students, staff, and a few guests mourn Dumbledore's death. He later reveals to Ron and Hermione that the locket Horcrux was a fake. The locket contains a message from \"R.A.B.\", stating that he has stolen the real Horcrux with the intent of destroying it. Rather than returning for their final year at Hogwarts, the three decide to leave and track down the remaining Horcruxes.\n\nBefore David Yates was officially chosen to direct the film, many directors had expressed an interest in taking the helm. Alfonso Cuarón, the director of the third film, stated he \"would love to have the opportunity\" to return. \"Goblet of Fire\" director Mike Newell declined a spot to direct the fifth film, and was not approached for this one. Guillermo del Toro turned down the chance to direct the film in order to direct \"\". Terry Gilliam was Rowling's personal choice to direct \"Philosopher's Stone\". When asked whether he would consider directing a later film, Gilliam said, \"Warner Bros. had their chance the first time around, and they blew it.\"\n\nIn an interview with Dark Horizons, Yates said that \"I was still working on \"Order of the Phoenix\" when they asked me to do \"Half-Blood Prince\". So they were really delighted with the material that they were seeing while we were in post-production, and the conversations happened before the movie was released, because I had to start pre-production on it while \"Order of the Phoenix\" was being promoted. It was just something they see in the work that they really liked, and responded to.\" Yates described \"Half-Blood Prince\" as being \"a cross between the chills of \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" and the fantastical adventure of \"Goblet of Fire\".\"\n\nEmma Watson considered not returning for the film, but eventually decided that, \"the pluses outweighed the minuses,\" and could not bear to see anyone else play Hermione. Composer Nicholas Hooper returned from the last film; he included a reworking of John Williams's \"Hedwig's Theme\", which has recurred in all scores. Also maintained were costume designer Jany Temime, visual effects supervisor Tim Burke, creature and make-up effects designer Nick Dudman, and special effects supervisor John Richardson from the third film.\n\nYates and Heyman have noted that some of the events of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" influenced the script of \"Half-Blood Prince\".\n\nChristian Coulson, who played the young Tom Riddle in \"Chamber of Secrets\", expressed an interest in returning in the role for flashback sequences; Yates responded that Coulson was too old, nearing 30, to be playing the role. Jamie Campbell Bower, who appeared in \"\", previously noted that he had his \"fingers crossed\" he would be cast as a young Riddle. (Bower was, however, later cast as the teenage Gellert Grindelwald in \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\".) Thomas James Longley was the original choice to take on the role but Riddle was ultimately played by Hero Fiennes-Tiffin as a child and Frank Dillane as a teenager.\n\nHelen McCrory appears as Narcissa Malfoy, Draco's mother and younger sister of Bellatrix. McCrory was originally cast as Bellatrix in \"Order of the Phoenix\", but had to drop out due to pregnancy. Naomi Watts was previously reported as having accepted the role, only for it to be denied by her agency.\n\nBoth Clémence Poésy, who had played Fleur Delacour, and Chris Rankin, who had played Percy Weasley, were interested in returning, but did not appear in the film. After Bill Nighy expressed an interest in appearing, Yates confirmed that Nighy would be his first choice for the role of Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour. Scrimgeour's character was ultimately cut from the film, but Nighy appeared in his role in \"Deathly Hallows\".\n\nStuart Craig, the production designer of the first five films, stayed on to design all the sets in \"Half-Blood Prince\". Several new sets are introduced, including Tom Riddle's Orphanage, Astronomy Tower and the Cave. Craig noted that the film used several CGI sets, noticeably the interior of the Cave where Harry and Dumbledore both go to hunt Horcruxes. The exterior of the cave scene was filmed at the Cliffs of Moher in the west of Ireland, the only location to be filmed outside of the United Kingdom throughout the film series. The interior of the cave is made up of geometric crystal formations. Craig noted \"Apart from the point at which Harry and Dumbledore first arrive and the island formation on which everything inside the cave happens, the set is entirely virtual, designed in the computer. We'd had our first totally virtual set on the last film, so we approached this one with a bit more confidence.\"\n\nBefore filming began, there was belief that filming might move from the UK, where all previous films were shot. The crew also scouted around Cape Wrath in Scotland, for use in the cave scene. Filming returned to Glen Coe and Glenfinnan, both which have appeared in the previous films, to preserve the continuity of the landscape.\n\nFollowing a week of rehearsals, principal photography began on 24 September 2007 and ended on 17 May 2008. Though Radcliffe, Gambon and Broadbent started shooting in late September 2007, some other cast members started much later: Grint did not begin until November 2007, Watson did not begin until December 2007, Rickman until January 2008, and Bonham Carter until February 2008.\n\nOn the weekend of 6 October 2007, the crew shot scenes involving the Hogwarts Express in the misty and dewy environment of Fort William, Scotland. A series of night scenes were filmed in the village of Lacock and the cloisters at Lacock Abbey for three nights starting 25 October 2007. Filming took place from 5 pm to 5 am daily, and residents of the street were asked to black out their windows with dark blinds. On set reports indicated that the main scene filmed was Harry and Dumbledore's visit to Slughorn's house. Further filming took place in Surbiton railway station in October 2007, Gloucester Cathedral, where the first and second films were shot, in February 2008, and at the Millennium Bridge in London in March 2008.\n\nDue to cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel's use of de-focussing and soft wipes in the digital grade, Warner Bros. asked director David Yates to add more colours to the film. Yates didn't want to lose the \"very European look\" of the film, but after retouching the picture, he said, \"It's not what you wanted, but we're happy with it.\" After five minutes of watching the film, the studio were pleased with the changes. In an interview with \"Total Film\", Yates said that \"the choice of angles, the extreme close-ups, [and] the pacing of the scenes\" made the film \"incredibly rich\". The palette and lighting was heavily inspired by the Dutch painter Rembrandt. \"Half-Blood Prince\" is the only film in the series to be nominated for the Best Cinematography accolade at the Academy Awards.\n\nOne of the major challenges for Delbonnel was lighting the film. In an interview with the Academy, he said, \"Some of the sets are there since the very first \"Potter\". How could I light them in a different way? This question brought another one based on the series itself… I thought it would be interesting to have those very intimate stories amidst this very dark mood. As if the school was a dark character. That's when I suggested to go for this (again) dark moody variations of greys. Fortunately David Yates, and the producers liked the idea.\" In reference to the cave scene Delbonnel said, \"I wanted to have some kind of 'dynamism' with the light. I thought it could be interesting and more dramatic if the light was floating, circling above the characters faces: sometimes lighting them, sometimes hiding them in a very random and unpredictable way.\"\n\nTim Burke and Tim Alexander were the visual effects supervisors for the film. Tim Alexander said that completing the Inferi-attack scene took several months. He said, \"It's certainly much bolder and scarier than we imagined that they'd ever go in a 'Potter' movie. Director David Yates was cautious of not making this into a zombie movie, so we were constantly trying to figure out how not to make these dead people coming up look like zombies. A lot of it came down to their movement – they don't move fast, but they don't move really slow or groan and moan. We ended up going with a very realistic style.\" He also noted that Inferi are skinnier than zombies, waterlogged and grey.\n\nAbout Dumbledore's ring of fire, he noted that the effect would look as if someone sprayed propane and then lit it. He added, \"We did a lot of research on molten volcanoes, which have a lot of heat going on but no actual flames, and collected a bunch of other references, including flares that burn underwater, and showed them to the Potter folks.\" The visual effects team emulated these six fire parameters: heat ripples, smoke, buoyancy, viscosity, opacity, and brightness. Since the whole fire scene was very time consuming, computer graphics artist Chris Horvath spent eight months finding a faster way to conjure flames.\n\nThe opening scenes of the Death Eaters' attack on Diagon Alley and London was created by Double Negative, led by VFX Supervisor Paul Franklin. Double Negative spent six months surveying and documenting the environment around the River Thames and Trafalgar Square to create the swooping views of the city. Double Negative also contributed the Pensieve sequences, developing complex directed fluid simulations to realise the swirling world of memory and the past.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Nicholas Hooper, who also composed the music for \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\". The soundtrack was released on an Audio CD format on 14 July 2009, a day before the film was released in cinemas.\n\nThe album debuted at number twenty-nine on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, thus making it the highest-charting soundtrack among all the six movie soundtracks released. It was nominated for the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album For Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.\n\nWhile at the middle of the series in length, the film \"Half-Blood Prince\" did add or change events in the literary canon. The book begins with a scene involving the Muggle Prime Minister. Yates and his crew debated over this scene, as well as the character Rufus Scrimgeour, but gave up the beginning of the movie to events described but not seen in the book. Yates thought it would give the audience a feel for what the Death Eaters were doing if they showed the collapse of the Millennium Bridge rather than simply describe it (as was done with the Brockdale Bridge in the book). As with \"Goblet of Fire\", the Dursleys were cut, which Steve Kloves did to \"break the pattern\". Further background of Tom Riddle was removed, such as the Gaunts because they felt it more important to concentrate on Riddle as a young boy, and an additional action scene at the Burrow was added to keep with the tone of the franchise. Yates felt that they needed \"an injection of jeopardy and danger\" and that without it there was too much comedy and lightness. A small battle scene at Hogwarts which happened during the end of the book was cut; Heyman commented that it was removed to \"[avoid] repetition\" with the forthcoming adaptation of the Battle of Hogwarts in \"Deathly Hallows\". Dumbledore's funeral was removed as it was believed it did not fit with the rest of the film.\n\nWarner Bros. has spent an estimated $155 million to market and distribute the film. The special-edition two-disc DVD for \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" contained two sneak peeks of the film, while the US edition included an additional clip. A 15-second teaser for the film was shown alongside the IMAX release of \"The Dark Knight\". The first full-length US teaser trailer was released on 29 July on AOL's Moviefone website. An international teaser was released on 26 October and another teaser trailer was released. The US theatrical trailer was released on 14 November. Another trailer was screened on the Japanese TV station Fuji TV during a screening of \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" on 18 January 2009. Scenes from the film were aired during ABC Family's Harry Potter marathon which took place 5–7 December 2008. On 5 February 2009, the first three promotional teaser posters were released, featuring Dumbledore and Harry. On 5 March and 16 April 2009, new trailers were released by Warner Bros.\n\nWarner Bros and MSN ran an online \"Order of the Phoenix\" quiz, with the prize being a walk-on part in the \"Half-Blood Prince\". As with the previous films, EA Games produced a video game based on the film. On 10 March 2009, it was announced that there would be a video game soundtrack, which was released on 17 March 2009. On 27 March six character posters were released: Harry, Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, Draco and Professor Snape. An English version of the international trailer and a Japanese version of the international trailer were released online 10 April. On 8 May, CW Channel aired a 30-second TV spot, which focused on the romantic side of the film. On 20 May, first clip from the film was released through \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\"s official website, showing love-struck Ron. Another clip of the film, showing Dumbledore visiting Tom Riddle's Orphanage was released on 31 May 2009, at MTV Awards.\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom, United States, France, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, India, Brazil, Spain and Mexico on 15 July 2009. It was originally set to be released on 21 November 2008, but was pushed back by eight months to 17 July, despite being completed. Warner Bros. executive Alan F. Horn noted that the move was meant \"to guarantee the studio a major summer blockbuster in 2009,\" with other films being delayed due to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike. The box-office success of summer WB films \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" and \"The Dark Knight\" also motivated the decision. An unnamed rival studio executive told \"Entertainment Weekly\" that the move was to \"stop next year's profits from looking seriously underwhelming after the phenomenal success of \"The Dark Knight\",\" as \"they don't need the money this year anymore.\" Dan Fellman, WB head of distribution, said that the studio had considered the date change for three to four weeks prior to the announcement, but gave it serious consideration a week before they came to their final decision. Three months before its release in July, the date was again changed by 2 days from 17 to 15 July, so it could open on a Wednesday like most tentpole summer movies.\n\nThe date change was met with a heavily negative reaction by \"Harry Potter\" fans, as the \"Los Angeles Times\" noted: \"Petitions were circulating, rumors were flying and angry screeds were being posted on Internet sites within minutes of the Thursday announcement.\" The move was mocked by \"Entertainment Weekly\" which had \"Half-Blood Prince\" on the cover on its \"Fall Preview Issue\". Despite each being owned by Time Warner Inc., \"EW\" was unaware of the change until it was publicly announced by WB and noted that readers would now be in possession of a \"Dewey Defeats Truman collectible\". Several days after the announcement, Horn released a statement in response to the \"large amount of disappointment\" expressed by fans of the series. Following the date change, \"Half-Blood Prince\"s release slot was taken by Summit Entertainment's \"Twilight\" and Walt Disney Pictures' \"Bolt\".\n\nThe sixth film was simultaneously released in regular cinemas and IMAX 3D everywhere but the United States, due to a conflicting agreement in which \"\" was given a four-week window by itself in IMAX in that country. Therefore, the IMAX 3D version of the film was released on 29 July 2009 there. The film's opening sequence featuring the destruction of the Millennium Bridge was in 3D. The film had been chosen to be screened at the 2008 Royal Film Performance on 17 November, but was not shown. Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund chief executive Peter Hore noted he was \"very disappointed\" with Warner Bros' decision.\n\nAdvance ticket sales on Fandango.com for \"Half-Blood Prince\" surpassed advance ticket sales for \"Transformers 2\" at the same point in sale cycles. It is also in MovieTickets.com's top 25 advance sellers of all time.\n\nRunning 153 minutes (2 hours 33 minutes and 19 seconds) long, \"Half-Blood Prince\" is the third-longest film in the series, behind \"Chamber of Secrets\" (161 minutes) and \"Goblet of Fire\" (157 minutes).\n\nLike the previous films, a 1-disc and 2-disc special edition for the film was released on Blu-ray with a Digital Copy and DVD on 7 December 2009 in the United Kingdom, and 8 December 2009 in the United States.\nThe Blu-ray and DVD includes an 11-minute, 38-second feature on the new Wizarding World of Harry Potter mini theme park which opened on 18 June 2010 at Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida. Also included are deleted scenes comprising 8 scenes with a running length of 6 minutes and 31 seconds, and a sneak peek of the next \"Harry Potter\" movie, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\" (2010). The Blu-ray and DVD released in India, the Philippines, South Africa, Czech Republic and Israel on 16 November 2009, making them the first countries to get the \"Half Blood Prince\" DVD release before the UK and the US. The release date for Australia and New Zealand was 18 November and for Brazil and Chile, 19 November. The Blu-ray and two-disc DVD editions in North America includes a digital copy of the film.\nIn the United Kingdom, the DVD release became the fastest-selling DVD of the year with an estimated 840,000 copies of the film sold in a few hours. In the US, the DVD made a strong debut at number one in both the DVD and Blu-ray markets widely beating out any competition with sales of 4,199,622 copies. Worldwide DVD and Blu-ray sales of the film show that it is the fastest-selling film of 2009.\n\nOn 14 June 2011, an Ultimate Edition was released simultaneously with the Ultimate Edition of the \"Order of the Phoenix\" film on both Blu-ray and DVD, containing new bonus features, documentaries and collectables.\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" broke the then-record for biggest midnight showings, making $22.8 million in 3,000 cinemas; \"\" bested this with $26.3 million. \"Half-Blood Prince\" opened in the same Wednesday slot that \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" did in 2007, which grossed $12 million in midnight runs, on its way to $139.7 million in its five-day debut in the US. The film's box office run was over on 17 December 2009.\n\nThe film opened in 4,325 cinemas (rising to 4,455 three weeks later, becoming the largest number of cinemas until \"\" surpassed it with the 4,468 cinemas) and grossed $58.2 million on its opening day at the top of the United States and Canadian box office, the third-highest Wednesday opening of all time behind \"\" and \"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse\". It is also the nineteenth-highest single-day gross of all time and the third-highest for a film in the \"Harry Potter\" franchise behind \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\"s $91.1 million and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\", which made $61.1 million. It earned an additional $46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $104 million, breaking the record for highest single-day worldwide gross, previously held by \"The Dark Knight\".\nBy 20 July, the film had taken in $158.7 million in the US and $236 million from 85 other markets, for a worldwide tally of $394.7 million. This broke the record for biggest-ever worldwide five-day opening, surpassing \"Spider-Man 3\"s $381 million; this makes the film the fastest to reach the $350 million mark in worldwide box office of all time. In the US, it surpassed all of its predecessors by a wide margin, achieving the sixth-largest-ever five-day opening in that country. The film held this record for two years until it was topped by \"Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" ($483.2 million). In the UK, the film grossed £19.75 million (equivalent to about $38.13 million), the highest opening for both the series and releases of 2009. At the end of the film's US and Canadian box office run the total ticket sales of the film were $302 million, making it the third most successful film in the franchise, after \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" and \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", as well as the third-highest-grossing film of 2009 in these regions behind \"Avatar\" and \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\". As with all of the previous films in the franchise, \"Half-Blood Prince\" proved to be extremely successful globally with an estimated non-US total gross of $632.5 million, totalling approximately $934.4 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2009, behind \"Avatar\", and the 34th-highest-grossing film of all time, unadjusted for inflation. It is the fifth-highest-grossing film in the franchise, behind \"Philosopher's Stone\", both parts of \"Deathly Hallows\", and \"Order of the Phoenix\".\n\nIn South Africa the film opened with the number one position grossing $789,176, it maintained a number one position during the second week, too, with a total of $242,336.\nIn Australia, as in most of the world, the film broke records with a debut of $11,492,142 and opening at number one, maintaining a second week at number one with a total of $5,278,096 (down 54%), and grossed a total of $24,208,243.\nIn France the film debuted at $20,541,239 from 949 cinemas.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 271 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dark, thrilling, and occasionally quite funny, \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" is also visually stunning and emotionally satisfying.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 78 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\". The film scored an 87 from professional critics at the Broadcast Film Critics Association; it is the first \"Harry Potter\" film to receive a Critic's Choice certificate. On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nThe first review of the film came three weeks before the official release. Paul Dergarabedian of Hollywood.com ranked the film with \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy and called the film a \"possible Oscar contender\". He highly praised the performance of Sir Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman and Daniel Radcliffe. He commented, \"\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" is a tour-de-force that combines style and substance, special effects and heart and most importantly great performances from all of the actors young and not-so-young\". Another early review came from the UK tabloid \"The Sun\", whose anonymous reviewer called the film \"masterful\" and \"very emotional\". The reviewer praised David Yates's directing and called Jim Broadbent's portrayal of Horace Slughorn \"perfect\". Devin Faraci of Chud.com called the film not only the best Harry Potter film yet, but also one of the best films of the year.\n\nAndrew Pulver of \"The Guardian\" wrote a positive review, and gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars rating. Todd McCarthy of the trade magazine \"Variety\" said that the film is \"dazzlingly well made\" and \"less fanciful than the previous entries\". He praised Alan Rickman's performance and he described Helena Bonham Carter as \"mesmerising\" and Jim Broadbent as a \"grand eccentric old professor\". BBC News's Tim Masters praised the film's cinematography, visual effects, production design, improved acting and darker plotline. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" Kirk Honeycutt noted that the film's first half is \"jerky and explosive\", but in the second half, the film finds better footing. He adds, \"Composer Nicholas Hooper, cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel and designer Stuart Craig deliver a singularly muscular and vigorous chapter\". \"Screen Daily\" called the film \"[s]tunningly shot by Bruno Delbonnel in metallic hues leavened by buttery tones and the thumping beats of Nicholas Hooper's score bear little resemblance to the original and the overall effect is much less tween, much more grown-up\".\n\nChris Tilly of IGN UK commented on the length of the film, saying \"while on occasion it drags, the 153-minute run-time never feels too long, thanks in no small part to the astonishing visuals and (largely) marvellous performances,\" and goes on to say, \"This is by far the best-looking of the Potter films thus far,\" commending the \"beautiful\" Quidditch match and the \"stunning\" finale. However, Dave Golder of SFX magazine found some aspects of the film to be a disappointment, largely due to the large number of opportunities the director and screenwriter had sacrificed to devote \"huge swathes of the film to subplots of Harry and his chums' teenage romances,\" but nevertheless found the film to be a large enjoyment, praising the performances of Jim Broadbent and Alan Rickman.\n\nDavid Stratton, of \"Margaret and David at the Movies\", gave the film a 2.5 out of a possible 5 stars, remarking, \"For non-readers [of the Harry Potter series] the films are now borderline incomprehensible\", and that the film was \"a little tedious\" and \"generally less interesting visually than its predecessors.\" He praised the cast, describing them as \"consummate\", adding Sir Michael Gambon \"really makes Dumbledore an imposing character\" and Jim Broadbent was \"wonderful\".\nMargaret Pomeranz, the co-host of the television show, gave the film 3 out of 5 stars.\n\nAt the time of its release, Rowling stated that \"Half-Blood Prince\" was her \"favourite one\" of the six film adaptations. Radcliffe, however, was critical of his own performance in the film, stating in an interview in 2014 that he was \"just not very good in it\", and calling it \"hard to watch\".\n\nThe film was nominated for BAFTA Awards in Production Design and Visual Effects, and was in the longlists for five other categories, including Best Supporting Actor for Alan Rickman. Bruno Delbonnel was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography at the 82nd Academy Awards. The film was also one of the final seven contenders for Best Visual Effects.\n\n"}
{"id": "26289750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26289750", "title": "Hawkeye (comics)", "text": "Hawkeye (comics)\n\nHawkeye (Clinton Francis \"Clint\" Barton) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Don Heck, the character first appeared as a villain in \"Tales of Suspense\" #57 (Sept. 1964) and later joined the Avengers in \"The Avengers\" #16 (May 1965). He has been a prominent member of the team ever since. He was also ranked at #44 on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes list.\n\nHawkeye is portrayed by Jeremy Renner in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a shared fictional universe that is the setting of films produced by Marvel Studios. Renner first made an uncredited cameo appearance in \"Thor\" (2011) and later played a larger role in \"The Avengers\" (2012), \"\" (2015), \"\" (2016), and the fourth Avengers film (2019).\n\nHawkeye was introduced as a reluctant villain in \"Tales of Suspense\" #57 (September 1964). After two more appearances as a villain in \"Tales of Suspense\" #60 and #64 (December 1964 and April 1965), Hawkeye joins the ranks of the Avengers in \"Avengers\" #16 (May 1965). He became a perennial member of the team and has made numerous appearances in all five volumes (Vol. 1 (1963–1996), Vol. 2 (1997), Vol. 3 (1999–2004), Vol. 4 (2010–2013), Vol. 5 (2013–present)), including specials and annuals, as well as in \"The Ultimates\". However, Hawkeye would be absent from the Avengers - both the team and the series - for nearly a decade starting in early 1973. Steve Englehart, the \"Avengers\" writer at the time of Hawkeye's departure, explained, \"When I had Hawkeye quit the Avengers, I liked him, but I wanted to try a different approach, so his leaving fit in with what I was trying to do.\"\n\nHawkeye featured prominently in the limited series \"West Coast Avengers\" #1–4 (September 1984–December 1984) as founder and team leader, before appearing in the ongoing title, which ran for 102 issues (including eight annuals) from October 1985–January 1994. The title was renamed \"Avengers West Coast\" from #46 (Aug. 1989). Hawkeye also starred concurrently in almost every issue of \"Solo Avengers\" which ran for 40 issues from December 1987–January 1991 (the title was renamed \"Avengers Spotlight\" from #21, the August 1989 issue).\n\nFrom 1998 to 2002, Hawkeye featured significantly as team leader in issues #20–75 and Annual #2000 of the title \"Thunderbolts\", written by Kurt Busiek and Fabian Nicieza. He appeared as a supporting character in \"Avengers Academy\" from issue #21 (Jan 2012) through its final issue #39 (Jan 2013) and as team leader in \"Secret Avengers\" from issue #22 (Feb 2012) through its final issue, #37 (Feb 2013). Hawkeye appeared in Vol. 2 (2013) of \"Secret Avengers\" by Nick Spencer and Luke Ross. Hawkeye appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 \"Secret Avengers\" series, from issue #21.1 (March 2012) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).\n\nHawkeye featured in the Marvel crossover event \"House of M\" (2005). He later appeared (as Ronin) in the \"New Avengers\" series from issues #26–64 (2007–2010) plus \"New Avengers\" Annual #2 (2008) and Annual #3 (2010). Continuing as Ronin, the character played an important part in the crossover event \"Secret Invasion\" #1–8 (2008). The company wide crossover event Dark Reign saw Hawkeye feature prominently in \"New Avengers: The Reunion\" #1–4 (2009) and \"Dark Reign: The List - New Avengers\" #1 (2009). He later went on to feature in the \"Siege\" #1–4 (2010) crossover event.\n\nHawkeye has appeared in numerous solo adventures over the years. He appeared in \"Hawkeye\" #1–4 (1983), written by Mark Gruenwald (which was the character's first encounter with Mockingbird and the villain Crossfire). Hawkeye then appeared in \"Hawkeye\" Vol.2 #1–4 (1994) and \"Hawkeye: Earth's Mightiest Marksman\" #1 (1998). In 2003, Hawkeye had a short lived on-going series, \"Hawkeye\" Vol. 3, #1–8, which was soon cancelled. Writer Jim McCann and artist David Lopez had another unsuccessful attempt at an ongoing series with \"Hawkeye & Mockingbird\" #1–6 (2010). The series did however spin into two limited series, beginning with \"Widowmaker\" #1–4 (2010–2011) and then \"\" #1–4 (2011).\n\nA fourth volume of \"Hawkeye\" began in August 2012 by the creative team of writer Matt Fraction and artist David Aja, which features a partnership with his protege, Kate Bishop, which was met with critical acclaim. As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel relaunch, a new series entitled \"All-New Hawkeye\" began in March 2015, written by Jeff Lemire with art by Ramon Perez, which only lasted 5 issues, then a second volume which continued the previous story ended after 6 issues.\n\nOver the years, Hawkeye has made guest appearances in numerous Marvel titles, the most notable being \"Daredevil\" #99 (1973), \"Incredible Hulk\" #166 (1973), \"Marvel Team-Up\" #22 (1974), \"Ghost Rider\" #27 (1977), \"Marvel Team-Up\" #92 (1980), \"Marvel Fanfare\" #3 (1982), \"Captain America\" #317 (1986), \"Contest of Champions II\" #3-5 (1999), \"\" #3 (2008), \"War Machine\" Vol.2 #8-10 (2009), \"Young Avengers Presents\" #6 (2008) and \"\" #3-6 (2009–2010).\n\nPost Civil War II, Hawkeye will star in new solo series called \"Occupy Avengers\" written by David Walker and penciled by Carlos Pacheco. Kate Bishop had starred in the 5th Volume of Hawkeye. However, the book had been cancelled with its 16th and final issue in early 2018.\n\nClint Barton was born in Waverly, Iowa. At a young age he lost both of his parents in a car accident. After six years in an orphanage, Clint and his brother Barney ran away to join the Carson Carnival of Travelling Wonders. Clint soon caught the eye of the Swordsman, who took the young boy on as his assistant. Along with the help of Trick Shot, the Swordsman trained Clint to become a master archer. Clint later found the Swordsman embezzling money from the carnival. Before he could turn his mentor over to the authorities, Clint was beaten and left for dead, allowing the Swordsman to escape town. Clint's relationship with his brother Barney and Trick Shot soon deteriorated as well.\n\nClint adapted his archery skills to become a star carnival attraction, a master archer called \"Hawkeye\", otherwise known as \"The World's Greatest Marksman\". He spent some time as a member of Tiboldt's Circus, before joining the Coney Island Circus. He witnessed Iron Man in action and was inspired to become a costumed hero. However, after a misunderstanding on his first outing, Hawkeye was accused of theft and believed to be a criminal. On the run, the naive Hawkeye met the Black Widow, a spy for the Soviet Union, with whom he fell in love. Blindly following the Black Widow, Hawkeye aided her attempts to steal technology developed by Tony Stark. In one of their battles with Iron Man, the Black Widow was seriously injured. Hawkeye rescued her and fled the battle to save her life. But before Hawkeye could take her to a hospital, the Black Widow disappeared. Hawkeye decided to be a \"straight-shooter\" from then on.\n\nHawkeye later rescues Edwin Jarvis and his mother from a mugger. In gratitude, Jarvis invites Hawkeye to Avengers Mansion and stages a confrontation to allow the archer to clear his name and gain the trust of the Avengers. Hawkeye is then sponsored by his former enemy Iron Man, who sees that he is serious about becoming a hero. Led by Captain America, Hawkeye joins the team along with Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch to form the second incarnation of the Avengers. Almost straight away, Hawkeye clashes with his fellow Avengers. His romantic intentions towards the Scarlet Witch are met with hostility from her brother, Quicksilver. Hawkeye rebels against Captain America's leadership (due to his past problems with authority figures), but over time comes to respect him as a mentor and a friend. When the Swordsman attempted to join the Avengers, Hawkeye warned them of his previous history with the villain.\nHawkeye enjoys many adventures with the Avengers and proves himself a hero on numerous occasions. However, when his bow breaks during a crucial moment in a battle, Clint decides to adopt a new costume and identity by succeeding Hank Pym as the new Goliath. Hawkeye (as Goliath) was later approached by his brother Barney, who had become a big-time racketeer. Barney had learned of Egghead's plans to construct an orbiting laser death-ray to extort money from the United States and came to the Avengers for help. The Avengers confronted Egghead and his allies, the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master. Tragically, Barney died in the ensuing battle. (It was later revealed that Barney Barton was actually an undercover FBI agent.) Soon after this encounter, Egghead hires the Swordsman to capture Goliath (thinking him to be Hank Pym instead of Clint). Clint defeats and captures both criminals, finding justice for his brother at last. At the conclusion of the Kree-Skrull War Clint resumes the identity of Hawkeye with a new costume. After several adventures, Hawkeye quits the Avengers after a bitter rift with the Vision over the affections of the Scarlet Witch. Hawkeye returns to his original costume and strikes out on his own.\n\nFor a time, Hawkeye drifts from one adventure to the next. He attempts to return to the Black Widow and briefly battles her current love, Daredevil. Hawkeye later assists the Hulk against the monster Zzzax. He then follows the Hulk back to the mansion of Doctor Strange, where after a skirmish, Hawkeye joins the \"non-team\" the Defenders for a short period. He returns briefly to the Avengers to attend the wedding of the Vision and the Scarlet Witch. Together with the Two-Gun Kid and Ghost Rider, Hawkeye defeats the monster the Manticore.\n\nHawkeye returns to the Avengers when the current members of the team begin to mysteriously disappear. The remaining Avengers discover it to be the work of the Collector of the Elders of the Universe. After his teammates were all defeated, Hawkeye single-handedly defeats the Collector, and joins the team for the final battle against Korvac. Afterwards, Hawkeye's victory is dashed when the Avengers' new government liaison Henry Peter Gyrich, limits the roster and replaces him with the Falcon, in an attempt to make the team more \"politically acceptable\". After initially failing to find work in his civilian identity, Hawkeye gains employment with Cross Technological Enterprises as the Head of Security. He defends the company against the Shi'ar villain Deathbird, Mister Fear, and sabotages a plot by C.T.E. employee Ambrose Connors. Hawkeye then returns to Avengers mansion several months later for a brief visit \"induced\" by the heroine Moondragon before rejoining for a sustained period. Hawkeye returns to Carson Carnival of Travelling Wonders to aid Marcella Carson, the owner's daughter, against the Taskmaster. He defeats the villain with the help of Ant-Man. Later, Hawkeye inadvertently avenges the death of his brother. The villain Egghead, having been exposed for framing Henry Pym, attempts to shoot Pym but Hawkeye jams the barrel of the weapon with an arrow. The weapon is an energy pistol and explodes, killing Egghead instantly.\n\nReturning to work for Cross Technological Enterprises as Head of Security, Hawkeye meets the former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Barbara \"Bobbi\" Morse, also known as the hero Mockingbird. Together, they discover that Crossfire, cousin of the company's original owner, was hatching a plot to destroy the superhero community via an aggression-inducing sonic weapon. Hawkeye and Mockingbird manage to defeat him (although Hawkeye is rendered 80% deaf when he uses a sonic arrow to counter Crossfire's weapon) and the two heroes get married shortly afterwards. At the direction of then-Avengers chair the Vision, Hawkeye (now using a hearing aid) and Mockingbird travel to Los Angeles to establish a west coast branch of the Avengers, known as the West Coast Avengers. While searching for a base of operations, Hawkeye and Mockingbird battle a vengeful Crossfire, who had recently broken out of prison. They manage to defeat the supervillain, aided by former actress Moira Brandon, who later allows her mansion to become the new Avengers Compound. On one of the West Coast Avengers adventures, when the team was lost in time, Mockingbird was kidnapped by an Old Western hero called Lincoln Slade, the Phantom Rider. The Phantom Rider drugs Mockingbird, convinces her that they are in love, and forces her to engage in a sexual relationship. Mockingbird soon regains her senses. In the resulting battle between the two, Mockingbird allows the Phantom Rider to fall to his death. Afterwards, when Mockingbird confesses what she did, Hawkeye is stunned that his wife would allow a man to die instead of facing justice. Their relationship becomes frayed as Mockingbird leaves the West Coast Avengers and separates from Hawkeye.\n\nHawkeye is challenged to a duel to the death by his former mentor Trick Shot. Hawkeye reluctantly accepts the challenge and wins. Trick Shot reveals that he is dying of cancer and wants to die honorably in battle. Hawkeye, instead of granting his former mentor's wish, promises to fund his medical care. Later, when Crossfire places a bounty on Hawkeye's right arm, Trick Shot (whose cancer had gone into remission) returns to aid his former pupil. Along with Mockingbird, the two archers defeat an army of supervillains looking to lay claim to the bounty. After this altercation with Crossfire, Hawkeye tells Mockingbird that he was wrong to blame her for what happened with the Phantom Rider. The pair soon reconcile. After being shot while confronting criminals, Hawkeye adopts an armoured version of his costume to battle the gangs of Los Angeles.\n\nThe West Coast Avengers are then caught in the middle of a supernatural battle between Mephisto and Satannish. The team are able to defeat the two demons and force them back to their own realms. However, Mephisto retaliates by firing energy blasts at the escaping West Coast Avengers. Mockingbird sacrifices herself to save Hawkeye and dies in her husband's arms. Embittered by Mockingbird's death, Hawkeye leaves the team, which is disbanded almost immediately afterwards. Hawkeye isolates himself in the Canadian Rockies to separate himself from the world. He is soon forced to battle the Secret Empire. He manages to defeat Viper, the leader of the Secret Empire, and her hired supervillains, Javelynn and his old mentor Trick Shot.\n\nHawkeye returns to the Avengers just prior to the battle with the entity Onslaught, in which the Avengers (including Hawkeye) are apparently killed. Franklin Richards, however, transported them all to a pocket universe where the heroes led altered lives. The heroes eventually learned the truth and they were returned to their own universe. Hawkeye's hearing was fully restored because, when Franklin Richards recreated the heroes in the new universe, he based them on how he remembered them.\n\nHawkeye remains with the Avengers for numerous adventures. He aids Avenger trainees Justice and Firestar to defeat the Taskmaster and Albino. Hawkeye later resigns the Avengers to assume leadership of the first generation of the Thunderbolts, who had broken away from the influence of Baron Helmut Zemo. Hawkeye trains the team in the fashion of former teammate Captain America, and shapes the team into a cohesive fighting unit. The Thunderbolts take on threats like the Masters of Evil, Graviton, and the Scourge of the Underworld. Hawkeye begins a romantic relationship with fellow Thunderbolts member Moonstone, who Hawkeye is proving to be a good influence on. Later, Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts travel to Hell to save the soul of Mockingbird. They defeat the demonic Mephisto, but Hawkeye is unable to find his wife. To ensure that his Thunderbolts are given full pardons, Hawkeye allows himself to be arrested in their place. The Thunderbolts' past crimes are erased on the condition that they retire from costumed heroics. The team reluctantly agrees. Later, when Hawkeye had gotten out of prison, the team comes back together to defeat Graviton once again. Convinced that they are ready to be heroes in their own right, Hawkeye hands leadership of the Thunderbolts to Citizen V (whose mind was actually under the control of Baron Helmut Zemo) and leaves the team.\n\nHawkeye joins the Avengers once more, and begins a brief romantic relationship with team member the Wasp. He also embarks on some solo adventures where he uncovers a plot to steal an ancient artifact in Laos, and investigates the murder of a former Soviet colonel. The Scarlet Witch, driven mad by her powers, causes a Kree warship to appear over the skies of New York. The Avengers, surprised by the appearance of the spacecraft, spring into battle. During the battle, Hawkeye's quiver of arrows is set on fire. Knowing that the explosive arrows were going to blow faster than he could remove them, Hawkeye flies into the engines of the Kree warship, destroying the spacecraft and sacrificing himself to save his teammates. A past version of Hawkeye is also plucked from time by the Time Variance Authority to serve as a juror in a case involving former Avengers teammate She-Hulk. She-Hulk tries unsuccessfully to warn Hawkeye as to his future.\n\nWhen the Scarlet Witch inadvertently alters reality, Hawkeye is resurrected with no memory of previous events. When a young mutant named Layla Miller gives several heroes (including Hawkeye) the ability to remember, he is horrified at the Scarlet Witch's actions. Hawkeye shoots Wanda in the back with an arrow. In retaliation, one of her recreated children wipes Hawkeye from existence, killing him once more. When the Scarlet Witch's reality is eventually undone, Hawkeye is still presumed dead. However, the recently formed New Avengers find his bow and arrows on the site of the old Avengers Mansion, pinning up an article about his death.\n\nUnknown to the New Avengers, Hawkeye is resurrected once reality was restored. He seeks out Doctor Strange, who offers Hawkeye shelter while he comes to terms with his new life. Against the advice of Dr. Strange, Hawkeye eventually travels to Wundagore Mountain and finds the Scarlet Witch living a normal life with no memory of her past and apparently without mutant abilities. The two become intimate and Hawkeye then leaves Wanda to her normal life. Returning to the United States, Hawkeye learns about the assassination of Captain America. He confronts Tony Stark, who then offers Hawkeye the Captain America shield and costume to continue the legacy. Hawkeye is later inspired by the words of Kate Bishop, whom he met while hiding his identity, and rejects Stark's offer.\n\nHawkeye returns to see Dr. Strange and meets the New Avengers. The team invites Hawkeye to join the team. Hawkeye accepts, and accompanies the team on a mission to Japan to rescue Echo. However, leaving behind his Hawkeye identity, Clint Barton takes on the disguise of Ronin. Echo, the original Ronin, later gives Barton her blessing to adopt her old identity. Clint later meets Kate Bishop again, but this time reveals his true identity, much to Kate's surprise. Impressed with Kate's skill with a bow, and the fact she reminds him of himself at her age, Clint blesses Kate to continue using the Hawkeye codename.\n\nClint (as Ronin) was part of the New Avengers team that head to the Savage Land after a tip from Spider-Woman that a Skrull ship had crash landed there. Emerging from the crashed ship was a selection of heroes claiming to have been abducted, one of which was Mockingbird. Clint believes that she is the real Mockingbird until Mister Fantastic's invention proves that the heroes from the Skrull ship were all imposters. Later, after the war for Earth was won, Clint is reunited with the real Mockingbird, who was revealed to have been held captive by the Skrulls for years.\n\nClint attempts to help Mockingbird as she tries to adapt to life back on Earth. He accompanies her to Zaragoza, Spain, to battle Monica Rappaccini and the hordes of A.I.M. in an effort to deactivate a \"dirty bomb\" designed by the evil scientific group. Despite their years apart, Clint and Mockingbird battle with comfort and understanding. They manage to defeat A.I.M. and foil their evil plot.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Skrull war, S.H.I.E.L.D. is dissolved and Norman Osborn is placed in power of national security. Osborn creates his own team of villainous Avengers by stealing the costumed identities of previous Avengers. The supervillain assassin Bullseye joins the team and takes on the mantle of Hawkeye. Watching the Avengers news coverage on television with the rest of the New Avengers, Clint is stunned to see the events taking place. Clint unmasked himself on network television and publicly denounces Norman Osborn and his regime. He is later elected as the leader of the New Avengers and makes toppling Osborn and the Hood from power his number one priority. Clint argues that the only way to beat Osborn is to kill him, although the rest of the team disagrees. Clint attempts to storm Avengers Tower single-handedly to achieve his goal. He defeats the Dark Avengers, but is captured and arrested when, after failing to kill Norman Osborn, he is attacked from behind by Ares. Clint was imprisoned and tortured at the hands of Mentallo. He was later freed by his teammates, and apologized for his actions.\n\nClint aids Captain America, Falcon and Black Widow as they battle the Red Skull and his henchmen to rescue Sharon Carter and the time-displaced Steve Rogers. Captain America later leads the New Avengers (including Clint) against Norman Osborn's forces as they attempted to lay siege to Asgard.\n\nAfter the events of Siege, Steve Rogers puts together a new team of Avengers. Clint joins the team and returns to his Hawkeye identity (although he encourages Kate Bishop to keep the Hawkeye identity as well). He and Mockingbird are also members of the New Avengers, although Hawkeye later leaves the New Avengers when he receives an Avengers priority call from the main team, claiming that he was only there to spend time with his wife.\n\nHawkeye aids Mockingbird and her anti-terrorist organization, the World Counter-terrorism Agency. Together, they thwart Crossfire's illegal arms operation, and encounter Lincoln Slade's descendant, Jaime Slade, who later goes onto become the new Phantom Rider. Crossfire and the new Phantom Rider team-up to battle the heroes. This feud has its casualties with Mockingbird's mother being severely wounded and the death of Hamilton Slade, both at the hands of Crossfire. Hawkeye leaves the W.C.A. after it becomes clear that his relationship with Mockingbird has become too strained. However, he quickly rejoins after being informed by Steve Rogers that a kill list of international spies includes Mockingbird.\n\nHawkeye and Mockingbird team up with the Black Widow to take on the mysterious new Ronin and the Dark Ocean Society. The new Ronin is later revealed to be Alexei Shostakov, the former Red Guardian and ex-husband of the Black Widow. During the final battle with the new Ronin, Hawkeye receives a strong blow to the head. When the battle is won, he assures Mockingbird and Black Widow that he suffered no ill effects from the blow. The blow to the head that Hawkeye received proves to be more serious than first thought. While battling the Lethal Legion with the Avengers, Hawkeye's aim is shown to be faltering. After the battle, Tony Stark, Donald Blake and Steve Rogers examine Hawkeye to discover what is causing it. Their diagnosis is that Hawkeye is steadily losing his sight and will soon go blind. Iron Man provides Hawkeye with technology that should stall the blindness. Later, Trick Shot arrives at Avengers Tower on the brink of death. Trick Shot tells Hawkeye that he was forced to train another archer, one who was as good as Hawkeye, before dying in his arms. Hawkeye was later ambushed by his brother Barney (who was revealed to have been the one trained by Trick Shot) who now goes by the name Trickshot. Barney manages to subdue Hawkeye and bring him to Baron Zemo. Baron Zemo had the brothers duel to the death. Hawkeye (despite going blind from a previous injury with the third Ronin) managed to best Trickshot in battle. Before teleporting away, Baron Zemo transferred Trickshot's criminal funds over to the \"victor\" Hawkeye, then taunted the hero for turning his brother against him. In custody, Trickshot agreed to a bone marrow transplant to save his brother's sight, but only so he could battle Hawkeye again in the future.\n\nFollowing the \"Fear Itself\" storyline, the Avengers Academy is reopened in Palos Verdes at the former West Coast Avengers headquarters, where Barton accepts an offer to become a teacher. The character receives a new costume in \"Avengers\" vol. 4, #19 (November 2011). Cullen Bunn, writer of \"Captain America & Hawkeye\", stated the costume was influenced slightly by \"The Avengers\". In 2012, Hawkeye becomes the leader of the Secret Avengers. The 2012 critically acclaimed \"Hawkeye\" vol 4 solo series, focuses on Hawkeye defending an apartment building from the Russian mob with the assistance of Kate and his brother Barney.\n\nHawkeye became a member of the New Avengers led by Sunspot at the request of S.H.I.E.L.D., who are suspicious of Sunspot's activities and want Clint to spy on them. However, during a conflict, Hawkeye is fired from S.H.I.E.L.D. due to deciding to side with the New Avengers against them and following Songbird's betrayal of the team as a S.H.I.E.L.D. double agent.\n\nDuring the \"Civil War II\" storyline, Hawkeye shoots Bruce Banner in the head with an arrow in light of Ulysses' vision of a rampaging Hulk standing over the corpses of the dead superheroes. During the Avengers-presided trial, Hawkeye stated that Bruce Banner approached him and asked for Hawkeye to kill him if he ever became Hulk again. He is acquitted of all charges and his actions heavily divided the superhero community in the Ulysses conflict.\n\nAfter Civil War II, Clint starts traveling the country and focuses his efforts towards helping the underprivileged with community based problems in an effort to redeem his actions from the event, beginning with the water supply in Santa Rosa. He eventually gains the aid of the Red Wolf of Earth-51920 to help him fight for those who cannot defend themselves.\n\nAfter Captain America leads Hydra's takeover of Earth as part of the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Hawkeye is one of the leaders for the few free heroes left on Earth (others are either trapped outside Earth's atmosphere, trapped in New York behind a Darkforce shield, or working with Hydra). After Rick Jones is able to send information to the heroes revealing that Captain America has been \"brainwashed\" by the Cosmic Cube Kobik to believe that he has been a Hydra agent since childhood, Hawkeye is one of the heroes favoring the idea that they can recover the fragmented cube and use it to restore Rogers to normal, in opposition to the Black Widow's plan to just kill Rogers and stop him. Despite their opposing viewpoints, Hawkeye falls back in love with Black Widow and is devastated by her supposed death at the hands of the evil Steve Rogers.\n\nShortly after Natasha's supposed death, a number of her enemies have been killed off. Hawkeye and Winter Soldier start investigating the trail of bodies left behind to uncover the mysterious assassin and determine if Black Widow is still alive.\n\nWhile Hawkeye has no superhuman powers (with the exception of the period when using Pym particles to become Goliath), he is at the very peak of human conditioning. He is an exceptional fencer, acrobat and marksman, having been trained from childhood in the circus and by the criminals Trick Shot and Swordsman. This includes considerable strength, as a supervillain found out when he tried to use the superhero's draw-weight bow and found that he could not draw back the string to launch an arrow.\n\nHawkeye has also been thoroughly trained by Captain America in tactics, martial arts, and hand-to-hand combat. Hawkeye excels in the use of ranged weapons, especially the bow and arrow, and carries a quiver containing a number of customized \"trick arrows\". In his role as Ronin, Barton shows great proficiency with the katana and other melee weapons. He has gained a reputation for being able to \"turn any object into a weapon\", and has been seen using items such as tin plates, coins, sticks and other debris to great effect against his enemies.\n\nHawkeye is also known to use a \"Sky-Cycle\" as his mode of transportation. The Sky-Cycle is modelled after a commercial snowmobile and is fitted with anti-gravitational technology. It is voice-operated and has an auto-pilot steering system. The original Sky-Cycle was custom made for Hawkeye by Jorge Latham while he was employed by Cross Technological Enterprises. Latham was later employed by the West Coast Avengers and built several more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawkeye was ranked as the 45th Greatest Comic Book Character of All Time by \"Wizard\" magazine. IGN also ranked Hawkeye as the 44th Greatest Comic Book Hero of All Time opining that only it takes a special kind of hero to parade around in blue and purple and battle deadly villains with nothing more than a satchel of arrows and only Hawkeye can successfully pull it off, and as #9 on their list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\" in 2012. In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Hawkeye as #27 on their list of the \"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\".\n\nThe fourth volume of \"Hawkeye\" has received favorable reviews for its focus on what Hawkeye does when he's not an Avenger, playing up his status as the \"everyman\" on the team. Praising the series in an article titled, \"How did Hawkeye become Marvel's best comic?\", \"The A.V. Club\" wrote, \"Spider-Man has long been considered Marvel's superhero everyman, but Hawkeye has stolen that title with this series.\" Comics Alliance's Chris Sims summarized it as, \"For (Hawkeye), everything that happens in the book is a pain, but it's something he deals with because he wants to help the people around him, to the degree that he's driven to do so even on his days off from literally saving the world.\" In 2013, \"Hawkeye\" was nominated for five Eisner Awards, winning two: Best Cover Artist and Best Penciler/Inker, and nominated for seven Harvey Awards, winning one. In 2014, \"Hawkeye\" was nominated for five Eisner Awards, winning two, and nominated for five Harvey Awards, winning one.\n\nOne of the series' most well received issues was the \"Pizza Dog\" issue (No. 11), which is told from the perspective of Barton's dog, Lucky. \"Wired Magazine\" said of the issue, \"The conceit is a high-concept, high-wire act for a comic to carry off, but Fraction and Aja stick the landing with a poise and grace that deserves full marks ... It manages to be both a functional murder mystery loaded with noir sensibilities – from the bloody paw prints that blot across the cover to a rooftop gun scuffle with neighborhood thugs – and a book that is as entertaining as it is experimental and worth reading a time or ten.\"\n\nIn 2012, the mother of 4-year-old Anthony Smith contacted Marvel because her son would not wear his hearing aid, as superheroes do not have to. Marvel responded with a custom comic book of the superhero Blue Ear for Anthony, and also pointed out that for years Hawkeye was deaf and used hearing aids.\n\nHawkeye's solo appearances have been collected in a number of trade paperbacks:\n\n"}
{"id": "334699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=334699", "title": "Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation", "text": "Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation\n\nThe Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (, \"Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi\" or ERT (ΕΡΤ) is the state-owned public radio and television broadcaster for Greece.\n\nERT began broadcasting in 1938 as the Radio Broadcasting Service or YRE (Υπηρεσία Ραδιοφωνικής Εκπομπής, ΥΡΕ).\n\nFollowing a government decision, the original company was abolished on 11 June 2013, with its 2,656 employees protesting against the closure and continuing broadcasting via a satellite transmission using European Broadcasting Union equipment. The EBU also began providing Internet streaming of the ERT broadcast.\n\nOn 12 June 2013, the Greek government proposed a successor organization, New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television (Νέα Ελληνική Ραδιοφωνία, Ίντερνετ και Τηλεόραση), shortened to NERIT (ΝΕΡΙΤ), which launched in August 2013 as \"Public Television\" (Δημόσια Τηλεόραση). As protests against the decision of the government (Coalition of New Democracy, PASOK, DIMAR) continued, on 15 June Prime Minister Samaras proposed returning ERT to service immediately, by having an emergency committee rehire selected employees. This offer was rejected by the ERT employees and Samaras' coalition partners.\n\nOn 17 June 2013, following an appeal by ERT's employees to the Council of State (Greece's highest administrative court), the Council suspended the government's decision to interrupt broadcasting and shut down ERT's frequencies and ordered the Finance Minister and the minister responsible for media, signing the decision, to take \"all necessary organisational measures for the continuation of transmission of broadcasting services and operation of internet websites by a public broadcaster for the period until the establishment and operation of a new operator that will serve the public's interest\". In his ruling, the Council's President found that the government's decision violated Law 1730/1987 which requires \"the contribution by a public broadcaster to informing, educating and entertaining the Greek people and the diaspora\". The Council's appellate division upheld the original Temporary Injunction three days later.\n\nUntil 24 October 2013, ERT's employees were able to offer the television programmes of NET (also simulcast in HD as 'ERT-HD') and ET3, and the radio programmes of ERA Athens, ERA Thessaloniki and Third Programme through conventional means (analogue and digital TV, FM, medium and shortwave radio broadcasts) as well as over the Internet. At approximately 18:11 EEST, ERT lost their satellite capacity on the Astra 23.5°E Astra 3B satellite after successful lobbying by the Greek government to the capacity provider SES S.A. That halted most conventional TV and radio broadcasts that received the feed from the satellite, but did not affect the regional ERA affiliates that produced their programming locally, nor a large part of Athens which is served by a DVB-T transmitter located within the ERT HQs in Ayia Paraskevi. Web streaming wasn't affected at all.\n\nAs of 24 March 2014, more than nine months after the decision to close down ERT, the striking workers still run 17 radio stations (15 regional, two national) and a single TV channel (ET3), from the regional radio studios, and the ET3 Television Building in Thessaloniki. FM and AM transmissions continue throughout Greece with some interruptions and shortwave transmissions continue with a weaker transmission power. All radios are also available as webstreams. The TV channel is sporadically transmitted in conventional means (analogue transmitters in Thessaloniki), and is always available as a webstream.\n\nIn April 2015, the Hellenic Parliament approved the draft of re-opening ERT S.A. and also voted and approved the draft of re-opening this broadcaster.\n\nAs of 11 June 2015, ERT started broadcasting again.\n\nERT began broadcasting in 1938 as the Radio Broadcasting Service or YRE (Υπηρεσία Ραδιοφωνικής Εκπομπής, ΥΡΕ), initially limited to radio services from Athens, with the Athens Radio Station based in the Zappeion. During the Axis occupation of Greece, the service was renamed as the Limited Hellenic Radio Company or AERE (Ανώνυμη Ελληνική Ραδιοφωνική Εταιρεία, ΑΕΡΕ). After Liberation, in 1945 the service was reorganized as the National Radio Foundation or EIR (Εθνικό Ίδρυμα Ραδιοφωνίας, ΕΙΡ), still based at Zappeion. The radio services were expanded to three national radio services as well as international radio services for emigrant Greeks. EIR was one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950.\n\nTest television broadcasts began in 1965 and full TV service began in 1966. In 1970, the company was renamed National Radio and Television Foundation or EIRT (Εθνικό Ίδρυμα Ραδιοφωνίας-Τηλεόρασης, ΕΙΡΤ). In 1966, the Greek Armed Forces began their own TV station, the Armed Forces Television or TED (Τηλεόρασις Ἐνόπλων Δυνάμεων, ΤΕΔ), renamed in 1970 as the Armed Forces Information Service or YENED (Ὑπηρεσία Ἐνημερώσεως Ἐνόπλων Δυνάμεων, ΥΕΝΕΔ). Television was prominently used as a propaganda medium by the Greek military junta of 1967–1974. YENED its name and military orientation until the early 1980s, when it was renamed ERT2 by the then PASOK government. On 1 September 1987, a third station was added – ET3, based in Thessaloniki, with mostly regional programming focused on Macedonia and the rest of Northern Greece.\n\nDuring the first 20 years of TV services in Greece, ERT broadcasting was limited, starting at around 5pm to between midnight and 2am. Since 1997 the three ERT TV channels are known as ET1, NET and ET3, and broadcast round the clock. ET1 is an entertainment channel whereas NET is focused on news services. ET3 is still focused on Northern Greece issues, although it broadcasts nationwide.\n\nERT was a major national sponsor and the official broadcaster of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. It has been broadcasting the Olympic Games in Greece since the Mexico City Games of 1968. It also broadcasts IAAF games while it is shown on privately owned channels mainly in the United States. Today it broadcasts documentaries, some from the private sector, and a few animated shows. With the introduction of independent privately owned channels in Greece in the late 1980s, programme quality changed to a more commercial variety, in order to survive the fierce competition for ratings. This was a major shift in the network's principles that was dominated by wider variety, alleged \"higher quality\" programmes including documentaries and World Cinema.\n\nOn 19 August 2011 the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation announced a planned restructuring of the company; ERT's main channels became NET and ET3, while ET1 was incorporated into the program of NET and ET3. Additionally the digital channels Cine+ and Sport+ ceased broadcasting, and their programming were again incorporated into that of the company's two major domestic channels. ERT World also saw changes in its programming to reflect the needs of the Greek diaspora as identified by a survey conducted by ERT. The Minister of State also said that the company would become \"public\" but no longer \"state-owned\".\n\nAt 17:45 EEST (UTC+3) on 11 June 2013, the Greek spokesperson, Simos Kedikoglou, announced ERT would close by the end of the day. ERT shutdown caused the loss of 2,500 employees.\n\nERT was dissolved by a Common Ministerial Decision that was enacted by virtue of Article 14B of Law 3429/2005 (regarding the dissolution, merger and restructuring of public companies) as amended by an urgent government Legislative Ordinace (FEK 139/11.06.2013, Issue A'). Despite running a budget surplus on income from a license fee outside the state budget, in a televised statement, Simos Kedikoglou, the minister responsible for media and the government's spokesperson, said that the ERT was a \"haven of waste\" that cost more and had fewer viewers than private stations.\n\nLater in the evening, some of ERT workers managed to continue the broadcasting via Ustream. Police forced their way into at least one of the transmitting stations, and all ERT transmitters were closed down around Greece, as was eventually the worldwide ERT World feed. Using satellite offices and other spaces that had not been closed down, ERT journalists continued to broadcast to the Internet. The nearest ERT Transmitters to Athens closed at approximately 23:17 local time. 20 seconds later, channel 902TV (the communist party channel) retransmits the ERT signal, although a few minutes later, the Greek government called Digea, the digital television service, to close the signal [902's] due to rebroadcasting the signal without permission, and so 902 was closed for a period of time. This action was deemed unacceptable by the citizens of Greece due to the Government not consulting the National Council of Radio and Television, the official body of Radio and Television in Greece.\n\nOn 12 June at noon local time, the AS and IP range of ERT, the official domain names \"ert.gr\", \"ert3.gr\", and \"voiceofgreece.gr\" were cancelled in the Greek Internet registry, meaning that live broadcasts on the Internet (ERT LIVE) have stopped, as well as the publication of all news articles. Emails sent to the broadcasters are no longer delivered. Other Internet assets registered by ERT are at risk of being closed (because their owner and contact address are no longer valid), notably the official Facebook page and Twitter account. ERT LIVE is relayed by other sites, such as the University of Greece.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union was quick to criticise the closure, issuing a statement the same evening where they expressed \"profound dismay on behalf of Europe’s entire public service media\" and urged the prime minister to reverse the decision. The EBU made the ERT stream available on satellite to its members, declaring as well that \"to be in the EBU, you must be a broadcaster, and so we will continue keeping ERT on the EBU council\" as said by the director, Ingrid Delterne. \n\nAlexis Tsipras, the leftwing opposition leader, expressed dismay in regards of ERT shutdown and described it as \"illegal\".\n\nOn 12 June 2013 a Greek government spokesperson, Simos Kedikoglou, announced the formation of a new public service broadcaster, New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television (NERIT). The company's services were expected to launch on 29 August 2013. The service provider was supposed to employ between 1,000 and 1,200 and will continue to be funded by advertising and tax contributions. \n\nThe broadcasting activities of NERIT did not take place in any case, because of a decision of the Council of State.\n\nERT reopened and continued broadcasting after the formation of Alexis Tsipras government in early 2015.\n\nERT broadcast radio programmes under the name of Ellinikí Radiofonía, since 1988. Under this name, ERT broadcasts four national radio services:\n\nFormer, discontinued channels:\n\nFormer, discontinued channels:\n\n\nFor a list of programmes, see list of programmes broadcast by ERT.\n\nERT is mainly funded by a license fee, paid with the electricity bill (along with other applicable taxes) which represents the vast majority of the resources of the public group. The fee was 4.74 euros per month in 2013, but was reduced to 3 euros per month upon the launch of ERT. It is not connected with actual ownership of a TV set.\n\nThere are modest grants from the government for contributing to educational public missions. And since 2008, some commercial resources from advertisers (even though the channels have lost significant parts of audiences) and the economical crisis in Greece has severely impacted the profitability of advertising and of commercial cooperation for the joint production of programs, as well as the collection of license fees on electricity bills.\n\nThe opening bars of \"Tsopanakos Imouna\" () is ERT’s corporate theme tune, as well as their interval signal on radio.\n\nERT is the holder of the biggest audiovisual archive in Greece, which includes also significant moments of the modern Greek history.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14641499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14641499", "title": "Memorial reconstruction", "text": "Memorial reconstruction\n\nThe term memorial reconstruction refers to the hypothesis that the scripts of some 17th century plays were written down from memory by actors who had played parts in them, and that those transcriptions were published. The theory is suggested as an explanation for the so-called \"bad quarto\" versions of plays, in which the texts differ dramatically from later published versions, or appear to be corrupted or confused.\n\nThe theory however is facing growing criticism by a number of scholars for being overly applied, and for being an elaborate theory, yet with little evidence to support it.\n\nIn 1623, the preface to the First Folio of Shakespeare's works specifically marketed its content as correct, in contrast to the garbled texts of \"stolen and surreptitious copies\" published previously. Memorial reconstruction has been supposed to be one of the ways in which texts were \"stolen\". Examples of possible memorial reconstructions are early editions of Shakespeare, including the second quarto (1598) of \"Richard III\" and the 1603 first quarto of \"Hamlet\". It has been theorized that the only version to survive of Christopher Marlowe's \"The Massacre at Paris\" is a text obtained in this way, although there is no persuasive evidence to support this assertion.\n\nThe theory has been used to explain the content of some quartos, and also to suggest identities of the actors responsible, on the assumption that they would get their own parts right, along with cue-lines and possibly other lines performed when they were onstage, but would most likely make more errors when reconstructing scenes in which their character was not present. The cast members of an Elizabethan dramatic production had their own parts written out for them, with relevant entrances and cues, but they did not have their own individual copies of the play text as a whole.\n\nThe theory has, however, been criticised on various grounds; that it is not based on serious research into the way actors actually remember or misremember lines; that texts may have been \"stolen\" by other means; and that the so-called \"bad\" quartos are early or alternative versions of plays that were later revised.\n\nThe theory first appeared during the 19th century, and it was more fully defined by W. W. Greg in 1909, when he analysed the quarto text of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" by systematically comparing the divergences from the Folio version. He concluded that scenes with the character of the Host are much closer to the Folio version than the other scenes are. He therefore deduced that the actor playing the Host had played a significant role in creating the text of the quarto publication. In 1915, Henry David Gray analysed the first quarto of \"Hamlet\" using the same method. He concluded that the actor who played Marcellus was responsible for the reconstruction. He explained the fact that the \"mousetrap\" scene in which Marcellus does not appear was also accurate by suggesting that the same actor must have also played one of the roles in that scene.\n\nBoth Gray and Greg argued that hired actors playing minor roles would be more susceptible to bribery, as they had much less to lose, than established actors in the company. They also suggested that an anonymous writer filled out the missing verses.\n\nThe theory became popular and was used to explain the textual oddities of many Elizabethan and Jacobean plays. There was debate about which plays may have been surreptitiously recorded by shorthand during a performance, which by memorial reconstruction and which by a combination of the two. Shakespeare's contemporary Thomas Heywood appeared to complain about the former practice when he attacked \"mangled\" versions of his works \"copied only by the ear\".\n\nThe shorthand method would be unlikely to involve major differences in accuracy from one scene to the next. John Dover Wilson, for example, argued that the \"Hamlet\" bad quarto was mainly based on a transcript but with additions from the actor playing Marcellus. There was much discussion of the first quarto of \"King Lear\", leading to the conclusion by some that it was based on a transcript and not an actor's memory, as divergences from the Folio version appeared consistently throughout and were not bunched by scene.\n\nCritics have argued that memorial reconstruction is not as prevalent as has been presumed (some use the term \"memorial reconstruction\" loosely to refer to both the supposed methods of illicit reconstruction from both actors and auditors). In 1975, Michael Warren argued that the quarto version of King Lear is not a \"bad\" text but that the later Folio version differed because it was a revised version. Later scholars such as James S. Shapiro have developed the argument.\n\nLikewise, it has been argued that the quarto of \"Romeo and Juliet\" was printed from a reduced and simplified version, designed for provincial productions. The argument has also been made for the published version of Marlowe's \"Massacre at Paris\", and the first quarto of \"Hamlet\".\n\nIn 1996, Laurie Maguire of the Department of English at the University of Ottawa published a study of the concept of memorial reconstruction, based on the analysis of errors made by actors taking part in the BBC TV Shakespeare series, broadcast in the early 1980s. She found that actors typically add, drop or invert single words. However, the larger-scale errors, which would be expected if actors were attempting to piece together the plays some time after their performance, failed to appear in most of the bad quartos. The study, however, uncovered some circumstantial evidence for memorial reconstruction in the bad quartos of \"Hamlet\", \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" and \"Pericles\". According to Maguire, virtually all the bad quartos appear to be accurate renditions of original texts that \"merit our attention as valid texts in their own right\".\n\nThe concept of memorial reconstruction has since been questioned by other scholars. In \"Shakespeare: An Anthology of Criticism and Theory, 1945-2000\", Paul Werstine asserts that the theory has \"yet to be empirically validated with reference to any extant Shakespeare quarto\" and that \"there is no documentary evidence that any actor ever memorially reconstructed a play\".\n\nAlberty Freillerat, in \"The Composition of Shakespeare’s Plays\", suggests that \"it is odd that all actor-reporters should make similar mistakes and report inconsistently\" and he concludes that the theory of memorial reconstruction is \"as disappointing as that of stenographic reconstruction\".\n"}

It is the most expensive single album ever sold. One double-CD of the album, which was recorded in secret over six years, was pressed in 2014 and stored in a secured vault at the Royal Mansour Hotel in Marrakech, Morocco. The album was auctioned to the highest bidder through auction house Paddle8 in 2015, and it was subsequently revealed the winning bid of $2 million was placed by American businessman Martin Shkreli. A legal agreement with the purchaser states the album cannot be commercially exploited until 2103, although it can be released for free or played during listening parties. It has since been argued by some artists involved with the project that producer Cilvaringz misrepresented to some affiliates of the group what they were contributing their work to and that it is not a true Wu-Tang Clan album, but rather a con job. Wu-Tang Clan founder RZA however quickly discredited the accusations by tweeting \"It's funny to hear 2 journalists, 2 managers & 2 of my students think they can define a 'real' Wu-Tang Clan album better than the founder???\" \n\nShkreli shared the intro and part of two tracks after threatening to destroy the album. In 2017 Shkreli allegedly livestreamed a portion of the album to YouTube after a verdict was reached in a criminal case against him. On September 6, 2017, Shkreli placed the album up for auction via eBay; it received 343 bids, with a winning bid of $1,025,100 USD. However, the sale was never completed, and in March 2018, the album was ordered by a judge to be forfeited as a result of the seizure of Shkreli's assets following his conviction for securities fraud.\n\nWu-Tang Clan producer Cilvaringz conceived the idea of a musical work in a single form based on music exploitation as a commissioned commodity in the Baroque, Enlightenment and Renaissance ages. The idea was developed with Wu-Tang de facto leader RZA into a concept presentable to the public. The album reportedly features singer Cher as a guest on two of the album's tracks.\n\nThe album was auctioned through auction house Paddle8 in 2015. A winning bid for the album was accepted on May 3, 2015, followed by months of legal diligence. Due to the unprecedented nature of the sale, new and unique legal structures were written for the sales agreement. The sale was completed on August 26, 2015, at a price \"in the millions\" to a \"private American collector\". On December 9, 2015, \"Bloomberg Businessweek\" identified the buyer as Turing pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli. The actual sale price was not revealed, but Bloomberg reported and Shkreli confirmed that he had purchased the album for $2 million.\n\nIn a statement emailed to Bloomberg, RZA said that the sale had been agreed upon before Shkreli's controversial price hike of Daraprim, an anti-infective agent most commonly used in immunocompromised patients with toxoplasmosis. RZA added that the group had donated a \"significant portion\" of the proceeds to charity upon learning who the buyer was. Among the charities Wu-Tang Clan donated to were the Children's Literacy Society, the Hip Hop Chess Federation and TTAC, an institution focused on showcasing alternative cures for cancer.\n\nMany fans reacted negatively to the news of the single-copy album, believing the album would not be available to the public until 2103. Wu-Tang member Method Man spoke out against the 88-year commercial ban, blaming fellow member RZA and producer Cilvaringz. RZA replied that the 88-year ban was necessary to maintain the integrity of the album as a work of art and to deflect any notions of a grand marketing or publicity stunt. According to him, the number 8 bears symbolic significance because there were eight original members of the Wu-Tang Clan, the numbers of the year 2015 add up to eight, Paddle8 has eight in its name, and a rotated eight is the symbol for infinity, which was used on their second album \"Wu-Tang Forever\". Wu-Tang later released an official statement saying that, although the music may not be sold to the public until 2103, the owner may exhibit or distribute the music for free.\n\nThe \"Guinness Book of Records\" certified \"Once Upon a Time in Shaolin\" as the most valuable album in the world, surpassing records by Elvis Presley and the Quarrymen (later the Beatles). On March 3, 2015, the album was detained at JFK Airport for three hours while border control determined the contents of its box.\n\nIn February 2016, artist Jason Koza sued RZA, Cilvaringz, Paddle8 and Shkreli in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for the alleged unauthorized use of his artwork on the album.\n\nThe track listing remained a secret for the buyer. Paddle8 released a track list of working titles the group used during the recordings. The track listing has been compiled by \"Complex\" magazine.\n\n\n\n"}

It was replaced in its turn, on 26 June 1964, by the notionally less-strictly government controlled Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française (ORTF), which itself lasted until the end of 1974.\n\nRTF was both state-owned and state-controlled. With a budget set by the French National Assembly under the direction of the Ministry of Information, all of its spending and investment plans had to be directly agreed by the Minister of Information and the Minister of Finance.\n\nAlain Peyrefitte, Minister of Information, speaking in a debate in the National Assembly on 26 May 1964, described RTF as \"the government in every Frenchman's dining-room\" – \"La RTF, c'est le gouvernement dans la salle à manger de chaque Français\".\n\nA public monopoly on broadcasting in France had been established with the formation of Radiodiffusion Française (RDF) in 1945. RDF was renamed \"Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française\" (RTF) in 1949 and ORTF in 1964. \nFrom the beginning, the public broadcaster experienced fierce competition from the \"peripheral stations\": French-speaking stations aimed at the French public but transmitting on longwave from neighbouring countries, such as Radio Monte Carlo (RMC) from Monaco, Radio Luxembourg (later RTL) from Luxembourg, and Europe 1 from Germany (exceptionally, in 1974, RMC was allowed to set up a transmitter on French territory).\n\nRTF's head offices were located in the avenue de Friedland in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. Its television studios and technical buildings were at 13–15 rue Cognacq-Jay.\n\nBy the start of the 1960s, the RTF had established five radio and two television channels:\n\n\nRegional television, for areas outside Paris, was slow to develop compared with the situation in the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe first regional station, known as Télé-Lille, began broadcasting on 10 April 1950 with two hours a day of programming for Lille and its surrounding area. The station's main news programme was called \"Images du Nord\" (\"Images of the North\"). Télé-Lille's signal did not stop at the country's borders, with the result that the station had five times more viewers in the Belgian provinces of West Flanders, East Flanders, and Hainaut than it had in northern France. By February 1952, the establishment of a co-axial link with the RTF's studios in Paris meant that Télé-Lille, when not televising its own programmes, could relay RTF's main Paris-originated programming.\n\nIn an attempt to counter the spread in Alsace of the viewing of programmes from regional television in the neighbouring German \"Land\" of Baden-Württemberg – the inhabitants of Strasbourg had, for example, been able to watch the coronation in June 1953 of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom only on West German television – Télé-Strasbourg began broadcasting on 15 October 1953.\n\nMarseille followed on 20 September 1954, Lyon on 8 November 1954, Toulouse in August 1961, Bordeaux on 25 January 1962, and most other regional centres opened shortly thereafter.\n\nFrom late 1963, the regional programmes were also broadcast on \"La deuxième chaîne\" by using optical standard conversion in the regional centres (a 625 lines camera aimed at an 819 lines monitor with a special CRT) in order to better adapt the regional coverage to the new \"regions\" created in France, and they remained even after the opening of \"La troisième chaîne\" (The Third Channel) under the ORTF on 31 December 1972, all three networks broadcasting the regional news, sometimes from two or even three different production centres (e.g. Niort broadcasting Poitiers on networks 1 and 3, and Nantes on network 2).\n\nThe directors of the RTF were directly appointed by the Minister of Information.\n\nDirectors-general:\n\n\nAssistant directors-general:\n\n\nDirectors of programmes, television:\n\n\nDirectors of news:\n\n\nDirectors of news (television):\n\n\nDirectors of sport:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3829005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3829005", "title": "Reddit", "text": "Reddit\n\nReddit (, stylized in its logo as reddit) is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, and images, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called \"subreddits\", which cover a variety of topics including news, science, movies, video games, music, books, fitness, food, and image-sharing. Submissions with more up-votes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough votes, ultimately on the site's front page. Despite strict rules prohibiting harassment, Reddit's administrators spend considerable resources on moderating the site.\n\nAs of February 2018, Reddit had 542 million monthly visitors (234 million unique users), ranking as the #3 most visited website in U.S. and #6 in the world, according to Alexa Internet, with 57.4% of its user base coming from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom at 7.5% and Canada at 6.3%. Across 2015, Reddit saw 82.54 billion pageviews, 73.15 million submissions, 725.85 million comments, and 6.89 billion upvotes from its users.\n\nReddit was founded by University of Virginia roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian in 2005. Condé Nast Publications acquired the site in October 2006. Reddit became a subsidiary of Condé Nast's parent company, Advance Publications, in September 2011. As of August 2012, Reddit operated as an independent entity, although Advance was its largest shareholder. Reddit is based in San Francisco, California. In October 2014, Reddit raised $50 million in a funding round led by Sam Altman and including investors Marc Andreessen, Peter Thiel, Ron Conway, Snoop Dogg, and Jared Leto. Their investment valued the company at $500 million then. In July 2017, Reddit raised $200 million for a $1.8 billion valuation, with Advance Publications remaining the majority stakeholder.\n\nThe site is a collection of entries submitted by its registered users, essentially a bulletin board system. The name \"Reddit\" is a play-on-words with the phrase \"read it\", i.e., \"I read it on Reddit.\" The site's content is divided into numerous categories, and the most popular posts from these 'subreddits' are visible on the front page to those who browse the site without an account. , \nthere are over 11,400 active subreddits.\n\nWhen items (links or text posts) are submitted to a subreddit, the users, called \"redditors\", can vote for or against them (upvote/downvote). Each subreddit has a front page that shows newer submissions that have been rated highly. Redditors can also post comments about the submission, and respond back and forth in a conversation-tree of comments; the comments themselves can also be upvoted and downvoted. The front page of the site itself shows a combination of the highest-rated posts out of all the subreddits a user is subscribed to.\n\nFront-page rank—for both the general front page and for individual subreddits—is determined by the age of the submission, positive (\"upvoted\") to negative (\"downvoted\") feedback ratio and the total vote-count. Dozens of submissions cycle through these front pages daily.\n\nThe site's logo and its mascot is a line drawing of an alien nicknamed \"Snoo\". Subreddits often use themed variants of Snoo relevant to the subject.\n\nAlthough most of the site functions like a bulletin board or message board, each subreddit has the option of having an associated wiki that can provide supplementary material like instructions, recommended reading, or collaboration for real-life events.\n\nRegistering an account with Reddit is free and does not require an email address. , there were 36 million user accounts. While logged in, Reddit users (known as redditors) have the ability to vote on submissions and comments to increase or decrease their visibility and submit links and comments. Users with enough experience and accumulated points can also create their own subreddit on a topic of their choosing, and interested users can add it to their front page by subscribing to it. Reddit comments and submissions are occasionally abbreviated and peppered with jargon, ranging from OP (for \"Original Poster\"—the user who posted the submission being commented upon) to NSFW (for \"not safe for work\"—indicating the post has graphic or sexually explicit content).\n\nReddit allows submissions that do not link externally. These are called \"self posts\" or \"text submissions\". Many discussion-based subreddits allow solely text submissions such as \"AskReddit\"—where users are only allowed to pose broad, discussion based questions to the community at large. Self posts at first did not accumulate karma points for the submitter. , however, these text-only posts also generate post karma.\n\nOn the site, redditors commemorate their \"cake day\" once a year, on the anniversary of the day their account was created. Cake day adds an icon of a small slice of cake next to the user's name for 24 hours. Redditors can \"friend\" one another, which gives a redditor quick access to posting and comments of their friend list. The commenting system and friend system, along with a certain \"Reddit ethos\" (called \"reddiquette\" on Reddit), lend Reddit some aspects of a social networking service, though not to the extent of Facebook, Google+, or other social networking websites. The Reddit community socializes at meetings held at local parks and bars around the world, and many localized subreddits for local in-person meetings exist.\n\nReddit entries are organized into user-created areas of interest called \"subreddits\". Originally, there was a primary \"main-reddit\", and other areas were \"subreddits\". There is no longer a single main-reddit. Initially it was replaced by a group of \"default subreddits\". , an introductory page was substituted prompting users to customize their \"subscriptions\". Subscribed subreddits appear on a user's front page and on a top navigation bar, and can deal with a large range of topics—such as video games, books, discussion, and music.\n\nThere are over 11,400 active total subreddits to peruse, including the former default set of 50 subreddits. This includes an aggregation of content termed \"/r/popular\", featuring top ranked posts across all of Reddit, with the exception of controversial subreddits (including both pro and anti-Trump communities, as well as those related to Gamergate). This replaced \"/r/all\", which doesn't filter controversial topics; it is still accessible via an \"All\" link at the top of /r/popular.\n\nIn an interview with Memeburn, Erik Martin, Reddit GM, remarked that their \"approach is to give the community moderators or curators as much control as possible so that they can shape and cultivate the type of communities they want\".\n\nPopular subreddits include:\n\nOn April Fools' Day 2015, a social experiment subreddit called /r/thebutton appeared. It displayed a button and a 60-second countdown timer. User accounts created before that day were eligible to participate. A user could only click the button once, or opt not to click it. If a user clicked the button the timer was globally reset to 60 seconds, and the user's \"flair\" (an icon next to the user's name) changed color. Colors were assigned based on a gradient from purple to red with purple signifying up to 60 seconds and red as low as 0 seconds. The countdown reached zero several times due to technical problems but eventually expired without further problems on June 5, 2015, after which the subreddit was archived.\n\nFor April Fools' Day 2016, another experiment was launched involving the \"Robin\" chat widget. After clicking a titular button, an IRC-like chat window was opened with one other user, and allowed a certain time to pick among three options, \"Grow,\" \"Stay\" and \"Leave\". \"Grow\" would join the chat with another group, \"Stay\" would close the group chat and create a subreddit with that group as moderators and \"Leave\" would close the group chat.\n\nApril Fools' Day 2017 featured a social experiment based on /r/place. The subreddit contained a collaborative pixel art canvas, where a user could place a pixel every five minutes (the timer was temporarily ten and twenty minutes for a few hours on April 1). Many people worked together to create large graphics, such as flags or symbols. Often subreddits would come together as a group to add a graphic from that community to place. Place was closed on April 3, 2017 at 1:00 PM GMT having been active for a full three days.\n\nFor April Fools Day' 2018, an experiment launched on the subreddit /r/circleoftrust. Upon clicking a button, each user was given one \"circle\" that they could entrust to others with the circle's password key to unlock and join the circle. While each user received one personal circle, they could join or betray any other user circles. Clicking the \"join\" button on another's circle would cause the owner's circle to grow bigger, while the \"betray\" button would cause the owner's circle to no longer function (having \"betrayed\" the owner's trust). On the /r/circleoftrust subreddit, all users have a \"flair\" next to their username that displays the number of users who've joined their personal circle, followed by the number of other circles the user has joined. Those who had betrayed another user's circle have a null sign (\"∅\") next to their numbered flair. The experiment ended on April 6, 2018.\n\nIn June 2005, Reddit was founded in Medford, Massachusetts by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, both 22-year-old graduates of the University of Virginia. The team expanded to include Christopher Slowe in November 2005. Between November 2005 and January 2006, Reddit merged with Aaron Swartz's company Infogami, and Swartz became an equal owner of the resulting parent company, Not A Bug. Condé Nast Publications, owner of \"Wired\", acquired Reddit on October 31, 2006, and the team moved to San Francisco. In January 2007, Swartz was fired.\n\nBy the end of 2008, the team had grown to include Erik Martin, Jeremy Edberg, David King, and Mike Schiraldi. In 2009, Huffman and Ohanian moved on to form Hipmunk, recruiting Slowe and King shortly thereafter. In May 2010, Reddit was named in Lead411's \"2010 Hottest San Francisco Companies\" list. In July 2010, after explosive traffic growth, Reddit introduced Reddit Gold, offering new features for a price of $3.99/month or $29.99/year. Reddit Gold adds a number of features to the interface, including the ability to display more comments on a page, access to the private \"lounge\" subreddit, and notifications whenever one's username is mentioned in a comment. It's also possible to endow comments or submissions of other users and thereby give a gold membership to them as an anonymous present.\n\nOn September 6, 2011, Reddit became operationally independent of Condé Nast, operating as a separate subsidiary of its parent company, Advance Publications. On January 11, 2012, Reddit announced that it would be participating in a 12-hour sitewide blackout in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act. The blackout occurred on January 18 and coincided with the blackouts of Wikipedia and several other websites. In May 2012, Reddit joined the Internet Defense League, a group formed to organize future protests. On February 14, 2013, Reddit began accepting the digital currency Bitcoin for its Reddit Gold subscription service through a partnership with bitcoin payment processor Coinbase.\n\nIn October 2014, Reddit announced Redditmade, a service which allowed moderators to create merchandise for their subreddits. Redditmade closed in February 2015. In November 2014, Chief Executive Yishan Wong resigned and co-founder Ohanian returned as the full-time executive chairman. Ellen Pao, Reddit's business and partnerships strategist replaced Wong, becoming the interim chief executive. On July 10, 2015, Pao resigned and was replaced by Steve Huffman as CEO.\n\nReddit launched a new blocking tool in an attempt to curb online harassment in April 2016. The tool allows a user to hide posts and comments from selected redditors in addition to blocking private messages from those redditors. A redditor is blocked by clicking an inbox button.\n\nIn 2015, Reddit had about 100 employees. By January 2017, their number had increased to around 140, then rising to 230 in July.\n\nIn April 2018, Reddit rolled out a new website design. The old design can still be accessed at old.reddit.com.\n\nReddit was originally written in Common Lisp but was rewritten in Python in December 2005. The switch was for wider access to code libraries and greater development flexibility. The Python web framework that former Reddit employee Swartz developed to run the site, \"web.py\", is available as an open-source project. , Reddit uses Pylons as its web framework.\n\nFrom June 18, 2008 until September 2017, Reddit was an open source project. During that time, all of the code and libraries written for Reddit were freely available on GitHub, with the exception of the anti-spam/cheating portions. , Reddit's main code repositories, backing its desktop and mobile websites, are no longer open source.\n\nUsers can contribute to translating Reddit into 89 languages using the localization management platform Crowdin.\n\n, Reddit decommissioned their own servers and migrated to Amazon Web Services. Reddit uses PostgreSQL as their primary datastore and is slowly moving to Apache Cassandra, a column-oriented datastore. It uses RabbitMQ for offline processing, HAProxy for load balancing and memcached for caching. In early 2009, Reddit started using jQuery. On June 7, 2010, Reddit staff launched a revamped mobile interface featuring rewritten CSS, a new color scheme, and a multitude of improvements.\n\nOn July 21, 2010, Reddit outsourced the Reddit search engine to Flaptor, who used its search product IndexTank. , Reddit uses Amazon CloudSearch. There are several unofficial applications that use the Reddit API in the Google Play store, and F-Droid repository. Examples include: \"Reddit is Fun\", \"Andreddit\", \"F5\", \"BaconReader\", \"Reddit Sync\" and an Android tablet specific application called \"Reddita\". There are also several Windows apps used to access Reddit, including unofficial Reddit apps such as \"ReddHub\" and \"Reddit To Go!\". An unofficial desktop application Reditr exists that is compatible with Windows, OS X, Linux and ChromeOS.\n\nThere are several Reddit applications for iOS. These include Karma, Upvote, iReddit, iPad-specific applications such as Reddzine and Biscuit, and, until April 2016, Alien Blue. In September 2014, an official mobile application for browsing AMA (Ask Me Anything) threads was released for the iOS and Android platforms under the name \"Ask me Anything\". In October 2014, Alien Blue was acquired by Reddit and became the official iOS Reddit app. In April 2016, Reddit released an official application called Reddit: The Official App, which is available on Google Play and the iOS App Store, and Alien Blue was removed from the App Store in favor of the new app.\n\nThe website is known for its open nature and diverse user community that generate its content. Its demographics allows for wide-ranging subject areas, or main subreddits, that receive much attention, as well as the ability for smaller subreddits to serve more niche purposes. For example, the University of Reddit, a subreddit that exists to communally teach, emerged from the ability to enter and leave the online forum, the \"classroom\", at will, and classes ranging from computer science to music, to fine art theory exist. The unique possibilities that subreddits provide create new opportunities for raising attention and fostering discussion across many areas. In gaining popularity in terms of unique users per day, Reddit has been a platform for many to raise publicity for a number of causes. And with that increased ability to garner attention and a large audience, users can use one of the largest communities on the Internet for new, revolutionary, and influential purposes.\n\nAdditionally, the userbase of Reddit has given birth to other websites, including image sharing community and image host Imgur, which started in 2009 as a gift to Reddit's community. In its first five months, it jumped from a thousand hits per day to a million total page views.\n\nStatistics from Google Ad Planner suggest that 74% of Reddit users are male.\nIn 2016 the Pew Research Center published research showing that 4% of U.S. adults use reddit, of which 67% are men. 78% of users get news from Reddit. Users tend to be significantly younger than average with less than 1% of users being 65 or over.\n\nIts popularity has enabled users to take unprecedented advantage of such a large community. Its innovative socially ranked rating and sorting system drives a method that is useful for fulfilling certain goals of viewership or simply finding answers to interesting questions. User sentiments about the website's function and structure include feelings about the breadth and depth of the discussions on Reddit and how the site makes it easy to discover new and interesting items. Almost all of the user reviews on Alexa.com, which rates Reddit's monthly unique traffic rating 125th in the United States, mention Reddit's \"good content\" as a likable quality. However, others raise the negative aspects of the potential for Reddit's communities to possess a \"hive mind\" of sorts, embodying some negative aspects of group interaction theories like crowd psychology and collective consciousness.\n\nReddit and its subreddits have conducted multiple charity projects, some short-term and others ongoing. Among the events:\n\nReddit models sociopolitical action, building upon crowdsourcing, user generated content, sharing, altruism, gamification, social reputation and social relevance (rather than financial return), participation, freedom of speech, openness, participatory and/or self-governance, new forms of interaction (e.g. #IAmA and AMA) and collective intelligence. The site has been used for a wide variety of political engagement including the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Donald Trump. It has also been used for self-organizing sociopolitical activism such as protests, communication with politicians and active communities. Reddit has become a popular place for worldwide political discussions.\n\nThe March for Science originated from a discussion on reddit over the deletion of all references to climate change from the White House website, about which a user commented that \"There needs to be a Scientists' March on Washington\".\n\nMany reddit users are highly engaged in the defense of Internet privacy, net neutrality and Internet anonymity. In advance of legislation that endangers these redditors typically set up pages to organize protest, create or curate content, call responsible authorities and inform about their issues and e.g. relevant tools and organizations.\n\nOn January 11, 2012, Reddit announced that it would be participating in a 12-hour sitewide blackout in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act. The blackout occurred on January 18 and coincided with the blackouts of Wikipedia and several other websites. In May 2012, Reddit joined the Internet Defense League, a group formed to organize future protests.\n\nThe site is known for hosting groups of users who support legalization of marijuana. The subreddit dedicated to cannabis culture /r/trees is most active in this regard and often organizes, coordinates or supports drug reform campaigns.\n\nIn 2010, the site ran ads promoting marijuana legalization without charge, after Conde Nast stated that they did not want to benefit financially from this particular issue.\n\nIn February 2013, Betabeat published a post that recognized the influx of multi-national corporations like Costco, Taco Bell, Subaru, and McDonald's posting branded content on Reddit that was made to appear as if it was original content from legitimate Reddit users. Reddit's former Director of Communications noted that while a large number of Chief Marketing Officers want to \"infiltrate the reddit community on behalf of their brand,\" she emphasized that \"self-promotion is frowned upon\" and the site is \"100 percent organic.\" She recommended that advertisers design promotions that \"spark conversations and feedback.\" She recommended that businesses use AMAs to get attention for public figures but cautioned \"It is important to approach AMAs carefully and be aware that this may not be a fit for every project or client.\" Nissan ran a successful branded content promotion offering users free gifts to publicize a new car, though the company was later ridiculed for suspected astroturfing when the CEO only answered puff piece questions on the site. Taylor described these situations as \"high risk\" noting: \"We try hard to educate people that they have to treat questions that may seem irreverent or out of left field the same as they would questions about the specific project they are promoting.\"\n\nReddit's users are more privacy-conscious than on other websites, using tools like AdBlock and proxies, and they hate \"feeling manipulated by brands\" but respond well to \"content that begs for intelligent viewers and participants.\" Lauren Orsini writes in ReadWrite that \"Reddit's huge community is the perfect hype machine for promoting a new movie, a product release, or a lagging political campaign\" but \"very specific set of etiquette. Redditors don't want to advertise for you, they want to talk to you.\" Journalists have used the site as a basis for stories, though they are advised by the site's policies to respect that \"reddit's communities belong to their members\" and to seek proper attribution for people's contributions.\n\nReddit announced that they would begin using VigLink to redirect affiliate links in June 2016.\n\nAlso known as the \"Slashdot effect\", the Reddit effect occurs when a smaller website has a high influx of traffic after being linked to on Reddit. It is also called the \"Reddit Hug of Death\" among the website's users. Because Reddit is such a large site, the traffic is immense and can easily crash smaller sites. In order for users to see crashed websites, several Reddit bots have been created that take a snapshot of the website before large amounts of traffic flood the affected website.\n\nAs a response to Glenn Beck's August 28, 2010, Restoring Honor rally (heavily promoted by him in his Fox News broadcasts during the summer), in September 2010 Reddit users started a movement to persuade satirist Stephen Colbert to have a counter-rally in Washington, D.C. The movement, which came to be called \"Restoring Truthiness\", was started by user mrsammercer, in a post where he described waking up from a dream in which Stephen Colbert was holding a satirical rally in D.C. He writes, \"This would be the high water mark of American satire. Half a million people pretending to suspend all rational thought in unison. Perfect harmony. It'll feel like San Francisco in the late 60s, only we won't be able to get any acid.\"\n\nThe idea resonated with the Reddit community, which launched a campaign to bring the event to life. Over $600,000 was raised for charity to gain the attention of Colbert. The campaign was mentioned on-air several times, and when the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear was held in Washington, D.C. on October 30, 2010, thousands of redditors made the journey.\n\nDuring a post-rally press conference, Reddit co-founder Ohanian asked, \"What role did the Internet campaign play in convincing you to hold this rally?\" Jon Stewart responded by saying that, though it was a very nice gesture, he and Colbert had already thought of the idea and the deposit for using the National Mall was already paid during the summer, so it acted mostly as a \"validation of what we were thinking about attempting\". In a message to the Reddit community, Colbert later added, \"I have no doubt that your efforts to organize and the joy you clearly brought to your part of the story contributed greatly to the turnout and success.\"\n\nIn May 2014 Reddit was blocked in Indonesia on the grounds that it hosts content that includes nudity. In June 2015 Reddit was blocked in China for possibly as long as a few weeks.\n\nThe website generally lets moderators on individual subreddits make editorial decisions about what content to allow, and has a history of permitting some subreddits dedicated to controversial content. Many of the default pages are highly moderated, with the \"science\" subreddit banning climate change denialism, and the \"news\" subreddit banning opinion pieces and columns. Reddit has changed its site-wide editorial policies several times, sometimes in reaction to controversies. Reddit has had a history of giving a platform to objectionable but legal content, and in 2011, news media covered the way that jailbait was being shared on the site before the site changed their policies to explicitly ban \"suggestive or sexual content featuring minors\". Following some controversial incidents of Internet vigilantism, Reddit introduced a strict rule against the publication of non-public personally-identifying information via the site (colloquially known as doxxing). Those who break the rule are subject to a site-wide ban, and their posts and even entire communities may be removed for breaking the rule.\n\nOn December 16, 2010, a redditor named Matt posted a link describing how he has donated a kidney, and included a JustGive link to encourage users to give donations to the American Cancer Society. After an initially positive reaction, Reddit users began to become suspicious of Matt's intentions, and suggested that he was keeping the donations for himself. Users telephoned his home and he received death threats. Matt eventually proved that he was genuine by uploading his doctor's records.\n\nOn October 18, 2011, an IT manager submitted a post to the subreddit \"gameswap\" offering Redditors to trade one of 312 codes he had been given for the game \"\". A group of users obtained his personal details, and began to blackmail him for the codes. The Monday after uploading the post, he received 138 threatening phone calls both at home and at his job, and by the end of the day he had been fired.\n\nFollowing the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, Reddit faced criticism after users wrongly identified a number of people as suspects. Notable among misidentified bombing suspects was Sunil Tripathi, a student reported missing before the bombings took place. A body reported to be Sunil's was found in Providence River in Rhode Island on April 25, 2013, according to Rhode Island Health Department. The cause of death was not immediately known, but authorities said they did not suspect foul play. The family later confirmed Tripathi's death was a result of suicide. Reddit general manager Martin later issued an apology for this behavior, criticizing the \"online witch hunts and dangerous speculation\" that took place on the website. The incident was later referenced in the season 5 episode of the CBS TV series \"The Good Wife\" titled \"Whack-a-Mole,\" as well as \"The Newsroom\".\n\nIn late October 2013, the moderators of the \"politics\" subreddit banned a large group of websites. Many were left-wing opinion websites, such as \"Mother Jones\", \"HuffPost\", \"Salon\", \"Alternet\", \"Rawstory\", \"The Daily Kos\", \"Truthout\", \"Media Matters\", and \"ThinkProgress\" as well as some popular progressive blog sites, such as \"Democratic Underground\" and \"Crooks and Liars\". They also banned a number of right-wing sites—\"Drudge Report\", \"Breitbart\", \"The Daily Caller\", \"Dailypaul\", \"Power Line\", and \"Reason\". Salon reported that \"the section's moderators explained in a post on Tuesday, the goal is 'to reduce the number of blogspam submissions and sensationalist titles.' The purge, the moderators explained, is also aimed at sites that provide lots of \"bad journalism.\" The December 2013 list of banned websites has been modified since late October, and sites with original content, such as \"Mother Jones\" and \"The Huffington Post\", are allowed. Moderators also banned RT, which moderators stated was due to vote manipulation and spam, though one moderator stated that he wanted RT banned because it is funded by the Russian Government.\n\nIn August 2014, photos from the 2014 celebrity photo hack were widely disseminated across the site. A dedicated subreddit, \"TheFappening,\" was created for this purpose, and contained links to most if not all of the criminally obtained explicit images. Some images of Liz Lee and McKayla Maroney from the leak were identified by redditors and outside commentators as child pornography because the photos were taken when the women were underage. The subreddit was banned on September 6. The scandal led to wider criticisms concerning the website's administration from \"The Verge\" and \"The Daily Dot\".\n\nAlso in August 2014, moderators and administrators removed a sizeable amount of content related to the Gamergate controversy; one thread in the \"gaming\" subreddit lost almost 24,000 comments. This included the subreddit \"ZoeQuinnDiscussion\", which was banned for violating the Reddit rules. Administrators attributed the bans to 4chan for raiding threads and causing harm, the accuracy of which was debated by some redditors.\n\nOn December 18, 2014, Reddit took the unusual step of banning a subreddit, \"SonyGOP,\" that was being used to distribute hacked Sony files.\n\nAfter Ellen Pao became CEO, she was initially a target of criticism by users who objected to her lawsuit. Later on June 10, 2015, Reddit shut down the 150,000-subscriber \"fatpeoplehate\" subreddit and four others citing issues related to harassment. This move was seen as very controversial; some commenters said that the bans went too far, while others said that the bans did not go far enough. One of the latter complaints concerned a subreddit that was \"expressing support\" for the perpetrator of the Charleston church shooting. Responding to the accusations of \"skewed enforcement\", Reddit reaffirmed their commitment to free expression and stated that \"There are some subreddits with very little viewership that get highlighted repeatedly for their content, but those are a tiny fraction of the content on the site.\"\n\nOn July 2, 2015, Reddit began experiencing a series of blackouts as moderators set popular subreddit communities to private, in an event dubbed \"AMAgeddon,\" a portmanteau of AMA (\"ask me anything\") and Armageddon. This was done in protest of the recent firing of Victoria Taylor, an administrator who helped organize citizen-led interviews with famous people on the popular \"Ask me Anything\" subreddit. Organizers of the blackout also expressed resentment about the recent severance of the communication between Reddit and the moderators of subreddits. The blackout intensified on July 3 when former community manager David Croach gave an AMA about being fired. Before deleting his posts, he stated that Ellen Pao dismissed him with one year of health coverage when he had cancer and did not recover quickly enough. Following this, a Change.org petition to remove Pao as CEO of Reddit Inc. reached over 200,000 signatures. Pao posted a response on July 3 as well as an extended version of it on July 6 in which she apologized for bad communication and not delivering on promises. She also apologized on behalf of the other administrators and noted that problems already existed over the past several years. On July 10, Pao resigned as CEO and was replaced by former CEO and co-founder Steve Huffman.\n\nIn August 2015, Steve Huffman introduced a policy which led to the banning of several offensive and sexual communities. Included in the ban was lolicon which Huffman referred to as \"animated CP\". Some subreddits had also been quarantined due to having \"highly-offensive or upsetting content\", such as /r/European, /r/swedenyes, /r/drawpeople, /r/kiketown, /r/blackfathers, /r/greatapes, and /r/whitesarecriminals.\n\nIn May 2016, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said on an interview at the TNW Conference that, unlike Facebook, which \"only knows what [its users are] willing to declare publicly\", Reddit knows its users' \"dark secrets\" at the same time that the website's \"values\" page was updated in regards to its \"privacy\" section. The video reached the top of the website's main feed. Shortly thereafter, announcements concerning new advertisement content drew criticism on the website.\n\nIn September 2016, a Redditor named \"mormondocuments\" released thousands of administrative documents belonging to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an action driven by the ex-Mormon and atheist communities of that site.

{"id": "1281933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1281933", "title": "Sawing a woman in half", "text": "Sawing a woman in half\n\nSawing a woman in half is a generic name for a number of stage magic tricks in which a person (traditionally a female assistant) is apparently sawn or divided into two or more pieces.\n\nThere remains a debate about the origin of sawing illusions, with some sources saying a magician named Torrini may have performed the first version in front of Pope Pius VII in 1809. However, it is more likely that the story is a fiction which has its roots in the writings of the famous French magician Jean Robert-Houdin. In his \"Memoirs\", written in 1858, Robert-Houdin described a sawing illusion performed by a magician named Torrini.\n\nModern magic inventor and historian Jim Steinmeyer has concluded that there was probably no real Torrini and the story was merely a way for Robert-Houdin to play with ideas. It was suggested during a court case in 1922 that the trick can be traced back to ancient Egypt; however, this claim has not been substantiated. Wherever the idea originated, until the 1920s it remained just an idea for an effect, rather than a practical application of a method.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the first public performance of a sawing illusion was achieved by British magician P.T. Selbit in January 1921 at the Finsbury Park Empire theatre in London. In fact Selbit had previously performed the illusion in December 1920 before a select audience of promoters and theatrical agents at the St. George's Hall, London, to try to persuade one of them to book his new act for public shows. His trick, which he billed as \"Sawing Through A Woman\", was significantly different from what a modern audience would expect. Selbit's assistant was locked inside a closed wooden crate and could not be seen. The impression that she could not evade the saw was created by the confined space in the box and by ropes tied to her hands, feet, and neck, which were held throughout the illusion by spectators from the audience.\n\nThe question of who was the first woman to be sawn in half has received much less publicity than the question of which magician first presented the illusion. According to Jim Steinmeyer the woman who participated in the December 1920 demonstration was Jan Glenrose, who was Selbit's main assistant at that time and who was also the partner of magician Fred Culpitt. In the public performance the role of victim was taken by principal assistant, Betty Barker.\nLater in 1921, Horace Goldin, a magician working in the United States, presented the first version which might look familiar to modern audiences. Goldin's assistant lay in a box from which her feet, head and hands protruded. Goldin sawed through the middle of the box, inserting metal sheets to cover the cut ends, and then pushed the two halves a little way apart. This process was then reversed, and the assistant released unharmed. Goldin later developed a sawing illusion that dispensed with boxes and used a large buzzsaw. The success of Selbit and then Goldin led to more and more magicians trying to imitate them with copies or improved versions of sawing illusions. By November 1921 the Thayer magic company in America was advertising a version for sale. A complete prop from Thayer would cost $175 or they would sell plans for $5.\n\nThere are many sawing tricks with significant differences in their basic effect. In some, the illusion is merely of a blade passing through an assistant's body, while in others it appears that the assistant is severed into two pieces that are moved apart. Some so-called \"sawing\" illusions do not actually involve a saw but instead use plain blades or blunt dividing panels.\n\nOne major group of tricks involves an assistant in a box, which conceals her body from view while any cutting takes place. This group includes the \"Selbit\", \"Wakeling\" and \"Thin Model\" tricks as well as several versions associated with Horace Goldin. Most \"box\" sawings give the illusion of the two halves of the assistant being moved apart, although there are versions where the effect is simply that a blade must have passed through the assistant's body. In some versions the box completely covers the assistant while in others the assistant's head, hands and feet remain in view during the trick.\n\nSeveral volunteers are recruited from the audience. One or more of these people are invited to tie ropes around the assistant's wrists, ankles and neck. The assistant then steps into a wooden crate or box, which is similar in proportion to but slightly larger than a coffin. The ropes are threaded through holes in the box and the ends are given to volunteers, who are instructed to pull them tight and keep hold of them (the neck rope has an added knot to prevent the assistant being strangled). The assistant is thus secured in a standing spreadeagle position in the box. The box is then closed and lifted into a horizontal position on a set of trestles. The magician then slides glass plates through the crate (and apparently through his assistant).\n\nThe magician then saws right through the centre of the box, dividing it into two. The sections are pulled slightly apart and the assistant's torso is visible. The impression is that the saw blade must have passed through the assistant's midriff. The assistant is then released from the box and is revealed to be unharmed. This was the illusion performed at the Finsbury Park Empire theatre in London on 17 January 1921.\n\nGoldin presented several sawing illusions that involved a box. To audiences they all appeared largely similar but they involved differing methods, which were steadily improved as time went on and as earlier methods were exposed. His first performance was at the Society of American Magicians annual banquet at the McAlpin Hotel, New York, on 3 June 1921. On that occasion the trick was not well received. The box he used was large and not very deceptive and instead of an attractive woman he employed a bellboy as an assistant. The impression given was that he was clumsily and hurriedly trying to cash in on Selbit's success in Britain. However, fellow magician Howard Thurston, who was in the audience, realised the potential of the trick and persuaded Goldin to let him help in its development.\n\nThurston employed an established magician and prop builder named Harry Jansen to perfect the illusion. Jansen's improved version of the apparatus featured a smaller box from which the victim's head and feet would protrude during the sawing. Goldin, Thurston and various other magicians employed by Goldin toured the United States performing this trick with great success at theatres belonging to the Keith-Orpheum group. Goldin had great promotional acumen and was fond of resorting to legal action to block anyone else, including Selbit, from competing with him in the USA. As a result, Goldin was sometimes wrongly credited as the originator of the sawing illusion.\n\nThe basic form of Goldin's box sawings was as follows. The magician presents a box which is similar in size and proportion to that used in the Selbit sawing but which is already in a horizontal position. An assistant climbs into the box and lies down. In the process her head and hands are seen to emerge from holes in one end of the box and her feet from the other. The box is closed and then sawn through across the middle. Dividers are placed into the box either side of the cut and it is then pulled apart so the sections can be seen clearly separated. The assistant's head and hands are seen sticking out of one section and her feet out of the other. The box is then pushed together again and opened and the assistant emerges unharmed.\n\nThe magician presents a rectangular table just big enough to accommodate a person lying upon it. An assistant is introduced and several assistants are recruited from the audience. The magician presents a set of restraints consisting of a sturdy collar and a pair of ankle straps, each attached to a length of chain or rope. The assistant sits on the table with her legs stretched out and volunteers are invited to fasten the restraints around her neck and ankles.\n\nThe ropes or chains are threaded through holes in the table and the ends given to volunteers, who are instructed to pull them tight and hold them that way throughout the illusion. The assistant is thus pulled down onto her back and secured in that position. Two halves of a large box are presented and fixed in place over the assistant, covering her completely. Side panels are opened to show the assistant is still in place lying flat on her back. The assistant is then divided into two. Sometimes the division is accomplished merely by pushing two metal dividing panels into slots near where the two halves meet.\n\nSometimes the cutting of the assistant is emphasised by sawing between the two halves of the box before sliding the dividers into place. Catches are released to allow the table to be separated into two halves along with the box. The halves are parted and the assistant thus appears to have been cut into two completely disconnected pieces. The box and table are then pushed together, the restraints are released and the box is opened to allow the assistant to emerge unharmed.\n\nThis version of the trick is generally associated with magician and inventor Alan Wakeling. Whilst Wakeling performed this illusion and perfected aspects of it, the general configuration and method have been attributed to an earlier magician, Virgil Harris Mulkey (1900–1989), aka. \"The Great Virgil\", who first performed it in 1942 and later passed on the idea to Wakeling.\n\nThe thin model sawing is one of the most common variants performed by contemporary magicians. The basic arrangement and sequence of events is similar to that described for the Goldin box sawings (see above). However, the box appears very shallow in comparison to Goldin's, which was large by modern standards. The ends of the box are initially open when the assistant climbs in. Once the assistant is lying down she is secured in place by having stocks placed over her neck and ankles. The stocks form the ends of the box. The shallow box adds to the impression that the assistant could not possibly find room to evade the saw blade even if she could release herself from the stocks and try to curl up in one half of the box.\n\nMagician Les Arnold is reported to have been the first to have devised a clear box sawing (known as the \"Crystal Sawing\") as far back as 1976. The Pendragons performed a variation called \"Clearly Impossible\", in which the box used is both particularly slim and also transparent. The concept of \"Clearly Impossible\" has been credited to Jonathan Pendragon and the major distinguishing feature of The Pendragons' illusion from the Les Arnold concept is that the transparent boxes are seemingly never covered.\n\nThe \"double sawing illusion\" is a way of adding an extra effect to box-type sawings. It is generally associated with the \"thin-model\" sawing apparatus. The magician saws two people in half using two sets of apparatus. The people are usually chosen or dressed so as to be clearly distinguishable. For example, they might be in different colored costumes, of different skin colors, or of different genders. After the box halves are separated they are jumbled up and then re-assembled so that the bottom half of one box is matched to the top of the other and vice versa. When the victims emerge, each appears to have been given the other's lower half.\n\nThe creation of this version has been credited to magician Alan Wakeling, who devised it for fellow magician Channing Pollock to perform.\n\nAn assistant lies down on a table. A frame is placed over her middle. The magician then presents an electric jigsaw and proceeds to align the blade into a slot in the frame. The magician switches on the saw and apparently uses it to slice through the assistant's waist, which remains obscured by the frame. The saw emerges from the opposite side of the frame. Once the sawing is finished the frame is removed and the assistant is revealed to be in one piece.\n\nThis variant begins in a similar way to the jig sawing, with the assistant lying on a table and having a frame fixed over her midriff. The magician then presents a bow saw and proceeds to saw through the assistant, with the blade guided within the frame. Once the blade has apparently passed all the way through the assistant the frame is released and removed. It is then revealed that the assistant is encircled by the handle and blade of the bow saw. Then he/she will have a member of audience come up and look at the props.\n\nA large apparatus is presented, consisting of a sturdy frame supporting a large buzzsaw or circular saw and a table sufficiently large to carry a person lying flat. It is shown that the table travels beneath the saw, leaving little or no gap, so that anything placed upon it in the path of the saw would be sliced through. The table is moved either by an electric mechanism or by some form of manual crank. The buzzsaw is generally driven by an electric motor. To demonstrate the saw is completely genuine, a piece of wood is placed on the table and sliced in two in full view. An assistant is introduced and placed in a horizontal position on the table.\n\nSometimes the magician might give the impression of hypnotizing the assistant into a rigid trance before having her lifted onto the table. She is secured in place with two metal \"straps\" that close over her waist and which align close to the plane of the saw. She might also be further secured with straps or manacles at her wrists and ankles. A strip of wood is pushed beneath her waist in line with the saw. The saw is then started and the table set in motion. The saw visibly passes through the assistant and generally sounds like it is sawing through something.\n\nOnce the table reaches the end of its travel and the saw is switched off the assistant is released and shown to be in one piece and uninjured. The strip of wood that had been placed beneath her is shown to have been sawn into two strips, thus reinforcing that the saw really did cut in the manner it appeared to. Harry Blackstone, Sr. was performing this effect in the United States in the 1930s.\n\nThe \"Death Saw\" is presented as an escape gone wrong. Its best known performer is David Copperfield. The performer is secured to a table beneath a large buzzsaw or blade, which is set to descend upon them under the control of a timing mechanism. After being secured with various manacles the performer is enclosed in a box. The saw is then set going.\n\nAfter a while the sides of the box fall away to reveal the performer struggling to escape the manacles. Finally the saw drops before the performer has time to escape. The blade slices right through the performer's body. The two halves of the table are rolled apart so that the performer is clearly separated into two sections. The performer then appears to command the whole process to reverse: The body halves go back together, the saw rises, the box closes. Finally the performer emerges unharmed from the box.\n\nCopperfield has claimed exclusive rights to this illusion; however, others, including Tennessee-based illusion builder Jeff Davis, have asserted that the method and effect were previously published in two magazine articles during the 1960s. The March 1965 edition of \"The Linking Ring\" contains text and diagrams from an Indian author called B. Rakshit giving the basic sawing method. An article in the September 1969 \"Genii Magazine\" outlines the routine including the idea of the saw descending a tower.\n\nAlthough not generally classified as a \"sawing\" illusion, \"Modern Art\" is sometimes billed as an \"upright dividing the lady in two\". The prop is a vertical cabinet which stands alongside a table-like structure that is half its height. The assistant enters the cabinet through a door in the side away from the table structure. The assistant's face can be seen peering from an opening at the top of the cabinet and a panel at the bottom of the front of the cabinet is opened to show the assistant's legs. A sword or blade is then placed into a slot at the point where the top of the half-height table meets the cabinet. The top of the cabinet then slides across onto the table, giving the impression that the top half of the assistant has been moved sideways and in the process been severed from the legs by the blade. Panels in the front of the cabinet are opened to show the top and bottom halves of the assistant apparently separate. The top of the cabinet is then slid back into its original position and the assistant emerges unharmed. The effect and method are credited to designer Jim Steinmeyer.\n\nCriss Angel performed a trick in which he appeared to pull a woman in half with his hands during an outdoor performance and half of her crawled away. The trick involved a woman with sacral agenesis and a contortionist. Magician and historian Ricky Jay has written that a version of this trick was previously performed by another magician. The magician that inspired Criss Angel's trick was Rajah Raboid, who performed this trick with Johnny Eck and his twin brother, Robert, in 1937.\n\nAs suggested by the various effects, detailed above, there are numerous methods for accomplishing sawing illusions. Over the years a number of these have been exposed and several have been published and are easily obtainable.\n\nPublishing of magic methods has proved a controversial subject at times. It has involved battles between those determined to expose methods and magicians, who have sometimes resorted to legal action to try to preserve secrecy. The sawing illusion has had a prominent role in the history of such battles and has thus contributed to case law.\n\nIn September 1921, motivated by concerns about preventing competition from other magicians who might copy him, Horace Goldin forwent secrecy and applied for a patent for \"Sawing a woman in half\". He was awarded U.S. patent number 1,458,575 on 12 June 1923. The following is an outline summary the patent:\n\nPenn and Teller use the second variant of this trick on a regular basis in Las Vegas. They have also performed this trick on television at least twice: on \"Home Improvement\" and during the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend. They always reveal how the trick is done.\n\nA number of performances or depictions of sawing illusions have achieved particular fame or notoriety.\n\nJim Steinmeyer has argued that Selbit's introduction of the sawing illusion was a turning point in the history of magic after which gentler styles represented by the likes of John Nevil Maskelyne were in irreversible decline to be replaced by more sensational presentations that owed something to the shock effect of Grand Guignol theatre. In particular, Steinmeyer identifies the sawing illusion as the beginning of a fashion for magic featuring female assistants in the role of victim. He says the cliche of \"pretty ladies teased and tortured by magicians\" was not a cliche prior to Selbit's illusion.\n\nMale assistants were common in magic history and in the Victorian era; the cumbersome clothes imposed on women by the fashions of the time made it impractical for them to squeeze into confined spaces required by some tricks. Changing fashions in the early 20th century made Selbit's choice of a female victim a practical proposition. It was also true that an illusion designed for a lithe woman might be more compact and deceptive than one tailored to fit a man. However, more controversially, a combination of the emancipation of women and a population desensitized by war and exposed to new entertainment phenomena meant Selbit's choice struck a chord in the public imagination. In Steinmeyer's words: \"beyond the practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment\".\n\nModern magicians, including female performers, have responded by placing a male performer in the role originally filled by a woman. Magician Dorothy Dietrich, who established herself as a leading magician as a teenager has been called the \"First woman to saw a man in half.\"\n\nAustralian magician Sue-Anne Webster performs a variation on the \"thin model\" sawing in which she saws husband Tim Ellis in two with a chainsaw.\n\n\n"}

It was acquired by the Criterion Media Group in July 2011 but the agreed investment never materialised. The service was shut down on 28 October 2011. At its peak the site was able to attract 2 million users a month.\n\nSeeSaw used part of the technology that was originally built for Project Kangaroo, the now defunct project owned by BBC Worldwide, Channel 4 and ITV plc. Project Kangaroo was blocked by the Competition Commission in February 2009. In September 2009 Project Kangaroo's technology and assets were bought by Arqiva for approximately £8m. The SeeSaw brand was announced on 3 November 2009. ioko developed the software and the user experience for the site, having already developed the software for Project Kangaroo. SeeSaw went into a closed beta on 26 January 2010 and was trialled by 20,000 people before being launched to the public on 17 February 2010. Streaming was done using Adobe Flash Player at three video quality settings - low, medium and high at speeds of 500 kbit/s, 800 kbit/s and 1,500 kbit/s respectively.\n\nAt launch, SeeSaw CEO Pierre-Jean Sebert confirmed that the company was in talks with set-top box manufacturers, TV manufacturers and game console manufacturers with a view to extending its service to additional screens. Former parent company Arqiva is a member of YouView which is building an open, internet-connected television platform for the UK market.\n\nIn January 2010, SeeSaw made its first foray away from the computer by making its ad-supported content available through Boxee. Senior Technical Architect, Ben Gidley, acknowledged looking into iOS solutions, although a lack of DRM stalled development. Platforms supporting Adobe Flash were expected to work and Gidley was able to confirm Android compatibility on 15 June 2010.\n\nOn 2 August 2010, Pierre-Jean Sebert, said SeeSaw was in late-stage negotiations with media companies in two countries to license its technology. \"It started as an opportunity, but we have now equipped ourselves in a strategy to deal with international expansion, on a business-to-business basis through partnerships,\" Mr Sebert said. While Sebert revealed that one of the deals was in Europe and the other was in a country \"very far away\", it was understood that one of the deals could have involved taking the SeeSaw brand name as well.\n\nOn 2 December 2009, SeeSaw announced a content deal with BBC Worldwide, so shows such as \"Cranford\", \"Lark Rise to Candleford\", \"That Mitchell and Webb Look\" and classic \"Doctor Who\" would be available for viewers at launch. On 29 January 2010, SeeSaw announced several deals. SeeSaw would carry programmes from Channel 4, including shows such as \"Peep Show\", \"The Inbetweeners\", \"Skins\" and \"Grand Designs\" and also from Five, including programmes such as \"The Gadget Show\", \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\". SeeSaw reached a separate agreement with UK independent distributor Digital Rights Group, which resulted in ITV dramas, such as \"Doc Martin\" and \"Kingdom\" being made available. SeeSaw also agreed separate deals with independent production firm Shed Media (through its distribution arm Outright Distribution) and Talkback Thames for a variety of programming including \"Footballers' Wives,\" \"Bad Girls\", \"Waterloo Road\" and \"The Apprentice\". In addition, the firm agreed the \"first of many\" planned US content deals with RHI Entertainment for 50 made-for-TV movies.\n\nSeeSaw launched to the public on 17 February 2010 with over 3,000 hours of free content, supported by 60-second pre and mid-roll advertising. June 2010 saw the addition of a pay-per-programme feature, with a 48-hour viewing window. On 20 May 2010, SeeSaw launched its paid-for service offering 1,000 hours of premium content. The platform had already agreed a deal with MTV Networks for Comedy Central shows such as \"South Park\" and MTV properties such as \"The Hills\", \"My Super Sweet 16\" and \"\". A range of BBC Worldwide shows were also available to rent, including \"The Royle Family\", \"Gavin & Stacey\", \"Spooks\" and Louis Theroux documentaries. The firm said that \"several\" other agreements were in the pipeline with \"major Hollywood studios\" to offer around 2,000 hours of premium content in the coming months.\n\nOn 18 August 2010, SeeSaw agreed a content deal with NBC Universal Television Distribution to make shows such as \"House\", \"30 Rock\" and \"\" available on its video on-demand website. The multi-year deal enabled SeeSaw users to rent individual episodes or full series of a range of US series, including \"The Office\", \"Heroes\" and \"Battlestar Galactica\".\n\nAs of October 2011, only archive shows from BBC Worldwide remained following SeeSaw's financial trouble.\n\nMaya Bhose from NBC Universal was appointed as head of brand marketing. Fallon were announced as the creative advertising agency and Vizeum as the media agency, with a £5m budget allocated to promoting the site. On 3 March 2010, SeeSaw hired Neovia Financial to implement and manage a payment system for its premium content service.\n\nNick Thompson, the long-time Managing Director of broadcast & media at Arqiva left in April 2011 as part of a management reorganisation at Arqiva. His successor, Charles Constable, was not made responsible for SeeSaw as Arqiva sought an investment partner. Pierre-Jean Sebert, formerly MD of British Eurosport, was appointed as Managing Director of SeeSaw on 31 July 2009 but left the company in 2011 as part of financial restructuring at Arqiva. As part of the Criterion Media Group's investment in SeeSaw, Michael Jackson became chairman designate on 14 July 2011, however he walked away from the company in September 2011 as Criterion failed to raise funding. On 13 September 2011, platform controller John Keeling, commercial director Matt Rennie and product director Richard Dines resigned from SeeSaw.\n\nOn 19 January 2011, Arqiva announced plans to find an investment partner for SeeSaw, with options for a sale of the online TV service believed to be under consideration. Arqiva completed a strategic review of SeeSaw in October 2010 and was seeking an investment partner to help with the \"aim of accelerating the development of the service\".\n\nHowever, on 27 May 2011, an announcement on the SeeSaw blog confirmed that \"next month will be the end of the road for SeeSaw\", with Arqiva directly announcing that SeeSaw would close on 20 June 2011, after failing to find an investment partner or buyer. However the site remained open, with Arqiva in talks to sell SeeSaw to US investment firm Criterion Capital Partners, although only a limited selection of free content from BBC Worldwide, Channel 4 and Channel 5 remained available. On 14 July 2011, it was announced that a consortium of investors, including Criterion Capital Partners, had purchased a 75% stake in SeeSaw for more than £10m. Arqiva retained a 25% stake, while Criterion Media Group, a division of Criterion Capital Partners, took majority ownership of SeeSaw. Criterion Capital Partners said the deal pulled together a number of investors: entertainment executives, new media entrepreneurs, institutional funds, and private equity partners.\n\nAs part of the deal, Criterion was required to raise a multimillion-pound round of funding to drive the rejuvenation of SeeSaw and set up its 28 staff in new headquarters by 31 August. Part of Criterion's plan to bring profitability was to renegotiate nearly 20 programme content deals. However SeeSaw failed to renegotiate its content deals with Channel 4 and Channel 5, losing two of its key partners. In September 2011 Criterion was understood to have run into problems with the lead backer in the investment consortium, Weston Capital. The delay meant that Arqiva was no longer contractually bound to run the venture, including providing ongoing funding. However the company and its remaining 15 members of staff were able to move out of Arqiva into a new office.\n\nOn 28 October 2011 SeeSaw was closed down after investors failed to provide the committed funding.

Hardy and lyrics by Jen Loring. It focuses on the story of the Tin Woodman character from L. Frank Baum's series of books set in the fictional Land of Oz, notably Baum's 1918 book \"The Tin Woodman of Oz\". The production employs live performers, puppets, music, and very few spoken words.\n\nOriginally created by James Ortiz & Diana Stahl and produced by Steven Laing & Jason Ralph, the show debuted in 2012 at Standard ToyKraft in Brooklyn, followed by a 2013 run at the Ars Nova ANT Fest. It has been produced Off-Broadway at 59E59 Theaters in 2014 and 2015, and at New World Stages in 2016.\n\nThe play has received critical praise, and won a 2016 Obie Award for Ortiz's puppet design. On September 2, 2016, a filmed performance of the work was broadcast by PBS stations, as part of the \"Theater Close-Up\" series produced by WNET in association with BroadwayHD.\n\nThe play focuses on the story of Nick Chopper, a mortal woodsman who falls in love with a young woman whose guardian is the Wicked Witch of the East. (The witch's rule has made everyone afraid to speak aloud, so people mainly communicate in noises.) The witch curses his axe and he begins to lose pieces of himself. As he falls apart, he is replaced piece by piece with metal, while trying to hold on to his love and identity.\n\n\nThe Woodsman (Original Off-Broadway Solo Recording), an album featuring the music composed and performed by Edward W. Hardy, was released digitally on May 29, 2016.\n\nThe album received positive mention in \"Broadway World.\" Hardy said the music was intended to \"reflect the period in history and to pay homage to L. Frank Baum’s touching story\", using different musical genres.\n\n\"New York Times\" critic Laura Collins-Hughes praised the 2015 production, especially for Hardy's music and for Ortiz's puppet design, while noting that the visual, nonverbal storytelling of the hour-long production was not always clear to the audience. Collins-Hughes found the 2016 production to be less rushed and \"more assured\", with an increased \"visual lushness\", but felt that \"mechanics get in the way of fantasy\" during part of the show. \"Variety\"'s Marilyn Stasio cited the production's \"haunting beauty\", while Frank Scheck of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" described the \"charming and disturbing\", minimalist production as the antithesis of \"Wicked\", the massively successful big-budget Oz-based musical playing a block away.\n"}

As a subsidiary of the Trinidad and Tobago Creative Industries Company Limited, FilmTT works on all aspects of film sector development, promotes Trinidad & Tobago as a film production location, and provides Film Commission services to local and incoming productions. FilmTT’s mission is to maximise the economic and creative potential of Trinidad and Tobago’s screen industries for the benefit of the country and its people. \n\nFilmTT, along with MusicTT and FashionTT, are sub-companies of CreativeTT; collectively, the group reports to the Ministry of Trade and Industry and is charged with the sustainable development of the creative sector in Trinidad & Tobago.\n\nAs the country’s Film Commission, FilmTT promotes Trinidad & Tobago as a location to attract productions to shoot there, and provides services to local and international producers. These are the services that FilmTT offers:\n\n\nFilmTT came under the purview of the Trinidad and Tobago Creative Industries Company in 2013.\n\nFilmTT is responsible for coordinating the necessary permits for crews to film. As a state agency, FilmTT organizes with various ministries within the government for clearance for various aspects of the production process. \n\nFilmTT researches and proposes a range of locations in and around Trinidad and Tobago to production crews for filming. The agency executes the legal negotiations involved in the acquisition of locations for filming.\n\nThe inaugural installment of Producers Talk facilitated a conversation between FilmTT and the producers of the last three feature films in which the film company invested both grant and equity funds – \"Moving Parts\" (2018) by Emilie Upczak, Play the Devil (2016) by Maria Govan (represented by producer Abigail Hadeed), and The Cutlass (2016) by Darisha Beresford (represented by producer Teneille Newallo). The intention was for the first-time producers to share information about their experiences producing these films with an audience of other producers, directors, production crew, and other members of the film producing community.\n\nTopics included sales and distribution, exhibition, filming in Trinidad and Tobago and funding, among others. \n\nThe Trinidad and Tobago Secondary Schools Short Film Festival was founded by MovieTowne and passed on to The Trinidad and Tobago Film Company Ltd (FilmTT) in 2010. Winning films are shown at the Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival annually and winning schools awarded with high-tech equipment to sustain their film programs and productions.\nThe national Smartphone Film Festival was launched in 2013. The competition which invites amateur filmmakers from Trinidad and Tobago to film mini-movies using only smartphone/mobile technology has no age limit. These short films must be no longer than 5 minutes in duration. The winner of the 2015 Smartphone Film Festival, Ayesha Jordan, had her film, “Good Ole Days” submitted into the 2016 Toronto Smartphone Film Festival.\n\nFilm Festival Season is an annual film industry event that occurs from September – November when Trinidad and Tobago's three major film festivals take place - trinidad+tobago film festival (ttff), Animae Caribe Animation and Digital Media Festival and Green Screen Environmental Film Festival. In 2018, the season runs from 4 September to 30 November. \n\nFor FilmTT, strategically investing in film festivals is one direct way of facilitating industry development, through structured, well-managed partnerships, while encouraging T&T’s mass audience’s growing tastes for more indigenous content. As a strategic marketing communications campaign, Film Festival Season seeks to not only create greater awareness of the activities taking place within the film and animation sectors, but also to create a sense of anticipation and pride in local creative products.\n\nIn May 2017, FilmTT awarded small Film Marketing and Development Grants to nine T&T filmmakers to advance their productions and careers. These grants are investments in the marketing and development of projects, including (but not limited to) attending regional or international film festivals, markets, incubators, labs or workshops. All projects will take place during the period May 1 – December 31, 2017. Based on evaluation, the following projects were selected to receive Government funding:\n\nThe Open Call, held in March 2017, was available for application to residing nationals or permanent residents of Trinidad and Tobago with at least three film credits for three different productions. Nneka Luke, General Manager of FilmTT, said that the call is an opportunity for the company to invest directly in active film projects in a targeted and sustainable way.\n\n"}
{"id": "5277440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5277440", "title": "Xeric Foundation", "text": "Xeric Foundation\n\nThe Xeric Foundation is a private, nonprofit corporation based in Northampton, Massachusetts, which for twenty years awarded self-publishing grants to comic book creators, as well as qualified charitable and nonprofit organizations. The Xeric Foundation was established by Peter Laird, co-creator of the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\".\n\nLaird founded the Foundation after considerable thought, as \"an appropriate way to give back something extra to the comics world,\" by providing grants for self-publishers. Laird stated that the Xeric Foundation is \"actually two foundations in one. One half of it is for charitable organizations, and the other half is for creators who want to self-publish their comics.\" That latter half being what the foundation is best known for.\n\nThe Xeric Foundation supported work of an alternative or non-\"mainstream\" nature, reasoning that if a comic had strong commercial appeal, it would be picked up by one of the major publishers. The Foundation was an extremely valuable supporter of \"art for art's sake\" comics, and helped launch the careers of a number of \"literary\" cartoonists.\n\nThe Foundation assisted comic book creators with some of the costs in self-publishing their work; it was not the Foundation's intention to fully support an artist/writer through the entire process of self-publishing, but rather to encourage creators to experience the learning process involved in working towards such a goal.\n\nThe creative side of the Foundation involved the usual application process, but in addition, the Foundation began with \"an advisory committee made up of three ... people working in the industry\" whose input is sought on how best to proceed with each application. Submissions were evaluated prior to Laird's involvement, and then he made the ultimate decisions based on their recommendations.\n\nLaird founded the Xeric Foundation in 1992, the name \"originat[ing] out of a Scrabble game with [Laird's] brother Don,\" \"Xeric\" simply being \"a word [he] like[d],\" ostensibly meaning \"dry and desertlike\" — but which ultimately \"has absolutely no direct connection with the foundation.\"\n\nThe Foundation's first grant cycle was in September 1992, with the first recipients being Robert Eaton, Michael Kasper, Jeff Nicholson, and Wayne Wise & Fred Wheaton.\n\nIn 1993 Laird discussed the Foundation's projected lifespan:\n\nHe hoped that ultimately the figure can be raised from \"thousands of dollars\" to \"hundreds of thousands of dollars,\" to support an increasing number of large and small projects.\n\nIn July 2011, the Foundation announced it would no longer award publishing grants, instead, focusing on charitable work, including fostering environmentalism, literacy, and the arts. Citing the changing nature of the comics industry, and specifically the ability of cartoonists to publish their work online, founder Laird announced the shift. According to the organization's website, one round of final grants will be awarded in 2012, giving applicants until May 2012 to complete their work. (The Foundation cancelled the scheduled November 2011 review.)\n\nAltogether, the Xeric Foundation has awarded in excess of $2,500,000 since its first grant cycle.\n\nNotable past winners of the Xeric Grant include Megan Kelso (1993), David Lasky (1993), Jason Lutes (1993), Adrian Tomine (1993), Tom Hart (1994), Jessica Abel (1995), James Sturm (1996), Ellen Forney (1997), Jim Ottaviani (1997), Gene Yang (1997), Dawn Brown (1998), Jason Little (1998), David Choe (1999), Nick Bertozzi (1999), Jason Shiga (1999), Farel Dalrymple (2000), Anders Nilsen (2000), Leland Purvis (2000), Jordan Crane (2001), Brian Ralph (2001), Hans Rickheit (2001), Donna Barr (2002), Derek Kirk Kim (2002), Sonny Liew (2002), Lauren Weinstein (2002), Josh Neufeld (2004), Karl Stevens (2004), Fred Van Lente and Ryan Dunlavey (2004), David Heatley (2005), Jeff Lemire (2005), Jesse Moynihan (2006), and Blaise Larmee (2009).\n\n"}
