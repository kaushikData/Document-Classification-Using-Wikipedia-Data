{"id": "163897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163897", "title": "Anthology film", "text": "Anthology film\n\nAn anthology film (also known as an omnibus film, package film, or portmanteau film) is a subgenre of films consisting of several different short films, often tied together by only a single theme, premise, or brief interlocking event (often a turning point). Sometimes each one is directed by a different director. These differ from \"revue films\" such as \"Paramount on Parade\" (1930)—which were common in Hollywood in the early sound film era to show off their stars and related vaudeville-style acts—composite films, and compilation films.\n\nSometimes there is a theme, such as a place (e.g. \"New York Stories\", \"Paris, je t'aime\"), a person (e.g. \"Four Rooms\"), or a thing (e.g. \"Twenty Bucks\", \"Coffee and Cigarettes\"), that is present in each story and serves to bind them together. Two of the earliest films to use the form were Edmund Goulding's \"Grand Hotel\" (1932), released by MGM with an all-star cast; and Paramount's \"If I Had a Million\" (also 1932), featuring segments helmed by a number of directors.\n\nEuropean directors such as Roberto Rossellini directed anthology films such as \"L'Amore\" (segments: \"Il Miracolo\" and \"Una voce umana\") (1948), \"Les Sept péchés capitaux\" (segment: \"Envie, L'Envy\") (1952), \"Siamo donne\" (segment: \"Ingrid Bergman\") (1953), and \"Amori di mezzo secolo\" (segment: \"Napoli 1943\") (1954). American studios soon followed with films like \"Quartet\" (1948) based on stories by W. Somerset Maugham. This led to two sequels, \"Trio\" (1950) and \"Encore\" (1951), as well as imitators like \"O. Henry's Full House\" (1952) and \"Actor's and Sin\" (1952).\n\nSometimes there is one \"top-level\" story, a framing device, which leads into the various \"sub-stories\", as in \"Intolerance\" (1916), \"Tales of Manhattan\" (1942), \"Flesh and Fantasy\" (1943), \"Dead of Night\" (1945), and \"The Illustrated Man\" (1968). \"Dead of Night\" helped to popularize the format for horror films—although they had existed as far back as \"Unheimliche Geschichten\" (1919)—and British company Amicus made several such films in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe 1989 film \"New York Stories\" consists of three segments directed by Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Woody Allen.\n\n\"The Red Violin\" (1998) could also be considered a portmanteau film, since the storylines revolve around the various owners of a precious sixteenth-century violin through the centuries. Similarly, 1964's \"The Yellow Rolls-Royce\" follows the owners of the titular vehicle.\n\nGene Kelly's 1956 all-dance film \"Invitation to the Dance\" consisted of three distinct stories, each different in tone and with its own plot line. Kelly appeared in each of the stories as different characters.\n\n\"Four Rooms\" is also an anthology film which follows the protagonist and his misadventures in four different rooms of a hotel. The four different segments (or rooms) were all directed by different directors.\n\nMohsen Abdolvahab's debut \"Please Do Not Disturb\" (2010) was a widely acclaimed tri-segmented Iranian anthology film.\n\nAnthology films are often mistaken with hyperlink cinema. Hyperlink cinema shows bits of many stories throughout the movie, whereas anthology films show story segments of one at a time. Some mistaken examples include \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Amores Perros\", distributing their storylines non-chronologically, separated by segments.\n\nV/H/S is a 2012 American anthology horror film created by Brad Miska and Bloody Disgusting. It features a series of five unrelated found-footage horror shorts tied together by a frame narrative. The film spawned two sequels, V/H/S/2 (2013), and (2014), and a spin-off, SiREN (2016).\n\nOn November 16, 2018, the Coen Brothers' American Western anthology film, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, was released on a limited theater run and on Netflix a week later. The film contains six separate stories written and directed by the Coen Brothers, which they wrote and accumulated over the last 25 years.\n\n\"Sirikkathe\", a Tamil film released in 1939, is considered the first anthology film in India.\n\nThe 1961 Bengali film \"Teen Kanya\" by Satyajit Ray, based on three short stories by Rabindranath Tagore, belongs to this genre.\n\n\"Chithramela\", a Malayalam film directed by T. S. Muthaiah, and \"Kathasangama\", a Kannada film directed by Puttanna Kanagal in 1975, are some of the earliest portmanteau films from India.\n\nRecent anthology films from Bollywood include Ram Gopal Varma's \"Darna Mana Hai\" and its sequel \"Darna Zaroori Hai\". \"Dus Kahaniyaan\" is also a noted portmanteau film from Bollywood.\n\n\"Love Sex aur Dhokha\", directed by Dibakar Banerjee also belong to this genre of films. While the characters of the part 'Sex' work in the supermarket, the characters of 'Love' and 'Dhokha' visits the market and acquainted with the protagonists of 'Sex'.\n\nIn Kannada Cinema famous director S. R. Puttanna Kanagal's 1976 film \"Katha Sangama\" is the first attempt in making anthology films.But the audience did not accepted this movie.However today \"Katha Sangama\" counted as one of the cult movie in Kannada Cinema history.It is made by three different stories of different authors.\n\nRecently in 2010, V. K. Prakash's Kannada movie \"Aidondla Aidu\" attracted people to theatres.People accepted the movie.He used author Jayaprakash Koloor's five stories in this movie.\n\nAn Indian Malayalam movie, \"Kerala Cafe\" (2009) includes 10 different stories packed up in a single movie by Ranjith, a well known Malayalam film director. The ten stories are directed by ten directors and more importantly, every film has a different team for its making. Another Malayalam Example is \"5 Sundarikal\" which had 5 Different Short-Movies. It also pays tribute to Indian film industry on its centenary. \"Yauvanam\"/\"Vandikkari\" (1974) and Adoor Gopalakrishnan's \"Naalu Pennungal\" (2007) are two other portmanteau films in Malayalam.\n\n\"Bombay Talkies\" is an Indian anthology film consisting of four short films, directed by Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee, Zoya Akhtar and Karan Johar. The film was released on May 3, 2013, to mark the centenary year of Indian cinema.\n\nSolo is a 2017 Indian bilingual anthology romantic thriller directed by Bejoy Nambiar, telling the story of four different people all played by Dulquer Salmaan, each story revolving around four different elements: Earth, Fire, Wind and Water, each with the different facets of Lord Shiva\n\nIn Assamese Cinema, Samiran Barua Ahi Ase was the first attempt to make a film based on Anthology consisting of four stories revolving around a leader of a terrorist outfit. Based on a story by Journalist Manoj Kumar Goswami and directed by Prodyut Kumar Deka, the film received official entry in the 12th Kolkata International film festival in 2012.\n\"Ji Galpar Ses Nai\" is a 2018 upcoming Assamese Anthology film by three directors Prodyut Kumar Deka, Prasant Saikia and Utpal Datta. Loneliness links the three different films based on stories by Maupassant, Balzac and Homen Borgohain.\n\nPackage film is a film consisting of several short films, often a feature-length compilation of short subjects in animation.\n\n"}

The term can also refer to the rankings themselves. The document is normally released about two weeks before the tournament begins. On the \"banzuke\" wrestlers are divided into East, which is printed on the right, and West, which is printed on the left. Each wrestler's full \"shikona\" (ring name), hometown and rank is also listed. The top of the page starts with the highest ranked \"makuuchi\" wrestlers printed in the largest characters, down to the wrestlers in the lowest divisions which are written in much smaller characters. The names of \"gyōji\" (sumo referees), \"yobidashi\" (ushers/handymen), \"shimpan\" (judges), \"oyakata\" (elders of the Japan Sumo Association), and occasionally \"tokoyama\" (hairdressers) are also listed.\n\nWhile not as old as sumo itself, the form and production of this document can be traced as far back as 1761, and has been a defining component of sumo for centuries. As is the traditional Japanese style, a \"banzuke\" is meant to be read right to left, top to bottom. It is considered a collector's item by sumo fans.\n\nThe rankings on the \"banzuke\" are decided by an assembly composed of 20 sumo judges and three supervisors who gather a few days after each official tournament. The assembly assigns ranks to over 600 wrestlers in six divisions based on their performance in the previous tournament. There are no precise rules for assigning rank, but the general rule is that a wrestler who achieved \"kachi-koshi\" (a majority of wins) will be raised in the rankings and a wrestler with a \"make-koshi\" (a majority of losses) will be lowered in the rankings. The degree of a wrestler's success or failure will help give the assembly a benchmark for figuring how far he rises or falls in the rankings.\n\nHigh-ranking \"gyōji\" then take on the laborious task of copying down the new rankings on a traditional Japanese paper roll called a \"maki\". They carefully write down the \"kanji\" characters of each wrestler participating in a tournament in a calligraphy style called sumo \"moji\". The work is very intricate and requires a great deal of skill. It usually takes about a week to complete the document. The \"banzuke\" information is carefully guarded for several weeks before it is released, which is usually on the Monday 13 days before an official tournament begins.\n\nThe \"banzuke\" is printed at a greatly reduced size on sheets of paper (58 cm x 44 cm) and copies are distributed by the Japan Sumo Association. Sumo stables buy a large quantity of them to give to their sponsors. Tea houses in the Tokyo sumo venue Kokugikan also buy them to give out to their patrons. They are also available for purchase for a small fee at tournament sites.\n\n"}
{"id": "79504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79504", "title": "Bard", "text": "Bard\n\nIn medieval Gaelic and British culture, a bard was a professional story teller, verse-maker and music composer, employed by a patron (such as a monarch or noble), to commemorate one or more of the patron's ancestors and to praise the patron's own activities.\n\nOriginally a specific, lower class of poet, contrasting with the higher rank known as \"fili\" in Ireland and Highland Scotland, with the decline of living bardic tradition in the modern period the term \"bard\" acquired generic meanings of an author or minstrel, especially a famous one. For example, William Shakespeare, and Rabindranath Tagore, are known as \"the Bard of Avon\" and \"the Bard of Bengal\" respectively.\n\nThe word is a Celtic loan word from Scottish Gaelic \"bàrd\", Irish \"bard\", Welsh \"bardd\". In 16th-century Scotland, it was a derogatory term for an itinerant musician; nonetheless it was later romanticised by Sir Walter Scott.\n\nIn medieval Gaelic and Welsh society, a \"bard\" (Scottish and Irish Gaelic) or \"bardd\" (Welsh) was a professional poet, employed to compose eulogies for his lord (see planxty). If the employer failed to pay the proper amount, the bard would then compose a satire (c.f. \"fili\", \"fáith\"). In other Indo-European societies, the same function was fulfilled by skalds, rhapsodes, minstrels and \"scops\", among others. A hereditary caste of professional poets in Proto-Indo-European society has been reconstructed by comparison of the position of poets in medieval Ireland and in ancient India in particular.\n\nBards (who are not the same as the Irish 'filidh' or 'fili') were those who sang the songs recalling the tribal warriors' deeds of bravery as well as the genealogies and family histories of the ruling strata among Celtic societies. The pre-Christian Celtic peoples recorded no written histories; however, Celtic peoples did maintain an intricate oral history committed to memory and transmitted by bards and filid. Bards facilitated the memorisation of such materials by the use of metre, rhyme and other formulaic poetic devices.\n\nOne of the most notable bards in Irish Mythological was Amergin Glúingel, he was bard, druid and judge for the Milesians.\n\nIn medieval Ireland, bards were one of two distinct groups of poets, the other being the \"fili\". According to the Early Irish law text on status, \"Uraicecht Becc\", bards were a lesser class of poets, not eligible for higher poetic roles as described above. However, it has also been argued that the distinction between \"filid\" (pl. of \"fili\") and bards was a creation of Christian Ireland, and that the \"filid\" were more associated with the church. By the Early Modern Period, these names came to be used interchangeably.\n\nIrish bards formed a professional hereditary caste of highly trained, learned poets. The bards were steeped in the history and traditions of clan and country, as well as in the technical requirements of a verse technique that was syllabic and used assonance, half rhyme and alliteration, among other conventions. As officials of the court of king or chieftain, they performed a number of official roles. They were chroniclers and satirists whose job it was to praise their employers and damn those who crossed them. It was believed that a well-aimed bardic satire, \"glam dicenn\", could raise boils on the face of its target.\n\nThe bardic system lasted until the mid-17th century in Ireland and the early 18th century in Scotland. In Ireland, their fortunes had always been linked to the Gaelic aristocracy, which declined along with them during the Tudor Reconquest.\n\nThe early history of the bards can be known only indirectly through mythological stories. The first mention of the bardic profession in Ireland is found in the Book of Invasions, in a story about the Irish colony of Tuatha De Danann (Peoples of Goddess Danu), also called Danonians. They became the \"aos sí\" (folk of the mound), comparable to Norse \"alfr\" and British fairy. During the tenth year of the reign of the last Belgic monarch, the people of the colony of Tuatha De Danann, as the Irish called it, invaded and settled in Ireland. They were divided into three tribes—the tribe of Tuatha who were the nobility, the tribe of De who were the priests (those devoted to serving God or De) and the tribe of Danann, who were the bards. This account of the Tuatha De Danann must be considered legendary; however the story was an integral part of the oral history of Irish bards themselves.\n\nThe best-known group of bards in Scotland were the members of the MacMhuirich family, who flourished from the 15th to the 18th centuries. The family was centred in the Hebrides, and claimed descent from a 13th-century Irish bard who, according to legend, was exiled to Scotland. The family was at first chiefly employed by the Lords of the Isles as poets, lawyers, and physicians. With the fall of the Lordship of the Isles in the 15th century, the family was chiefly employed by the chiefs of the MacDonalds of Clanranald. Members of the family were also recorded as musicians in the early 16th century, and as clergymen possibly as early as the early 15th century. The last of the family to practise classical Gaelic poetry was Domhnall MacMhuirich, who lived on South Uist in the 18th century.\n\nA number of bards in Welsh mythology have been preserved in medieval Welsh literature such as the Red Book of Hergest, the White Book of Rhydderch, the Book of Aneirin and the Book of Taliesin. The bards Aneirin and Taliesin may be legendary reflections of historical bards active in the 6th and 7th centuries.\nVery little historical information about Dark Age Welsh court tradition survives, but the Middle Welsh material came to be the nucleus of the Matter of Britain and Arthurian legend as they developed from the 13th century. The (Welsh) Laws of Hywel Dda, originally compiled around 900 A.D, identify a bard as a member of a king's household. His duties, when the bodyguard were sharing out booty, included the singing of the sovereignty of Britain—possibly why the genealogies of the British high kings survived into the written historical record.\n\nThe royal form of bardic tradition ceased in the 13th century, when the 1282 Edwardian conquest permanently ended the rule of the Welsh princes. The legendary suicide of \"The Last Bard\" (c. 1283), was commemorated in the poem \"The Bards of Wales\" by the Hungarian poet János Arany in 1857, as a way of encoded resistance to the suppressive politics of his own time. However, the poetic and musical traditions were continued throughout the Middle Ages, e.g., by noted 14th-century poets Dafydd ap Gwilym and Iolo Goch. The tradition of regularly assembling bards at an eisteddfod never lapsed, and was strengthened by formation of the Gorsedd by Iolo Morganwg in 1792, establishing Wales as the major Celtic upholder of bardic tradition in the 21st century. Many regular \"eisteddfodau\" are held in Wales, including the National Eisteddfod of Wales which was instituted in 1861 and has been held annually since 1880. Many Welsh schools conduct their own annual versions at which bardic traditions are emulated.\n\nThe musical and poetic traditions of the Welsh bards are perpetuated by the Gorsedd of bards and through the National Eisteddfod of Wales (\"Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru\").\n\nFrom its frequent use in Romanticism, 'The Bard' became attached as a title to various poets,\n\nFrom its Romanticist usage, the notion of the bard as a minstrel with qualities of a priest, magician or seer also entered the fantasy genre in the 1960s to 1980s, for example as the 'Bard' class (Dungeons & Dragons),\"Bard\" class (Pathfinder RPG - Paizo), \"Bard\" by Keith Taylor (1981), \"\" by Morgan Llywelyn (1984), and in video games in fantasy settings such as \"The Bard's Tale\" (1985).\n\n\n"}

A black cab is a type of hackney carriage (taxicab, An Austin FX4 or a Metrocab) common to Britain. The sessions are recorded while the black cab that serves as the studio travels through city streets, usually in London, England. Most of the performances feature rock bands, ranging from popular acts such as Death Cab for Cutie, The Kooks and My Morning Jacket to lesser known acts such as the Cave Singers. Other performances stray from the rock music scene, featuring poetry and beatboxing, for example.\n\nThe motto of the Black Cab Sessions is \"one song, one take, one cab.\" These performances have gained a cult following of viewers both on their own website and on YouTube.\n\n\"The Black Cab Sessions\" video clips begin with a screen showing the name of the artist and date the session was recorded. This is followed by a shot of the cab driver, who has just been informed that his cab will play host to the sessions, introducing the artist. The artists then give their performance. \n\nDuring the performances, the artists often have to react to the unusual venue. For example, during the New Pornographers session, the two musicians can be seen bouncing up and down in their seats as the cab hits speed bumps. The performances are also shaped by the limited space afforded by the back of a black cab. The uploads of acoustic acts with a different premise is a very popular one, with different projects using different selling points, Acts Unsigned, Tea and Biscuit Sessions and many others using the niche to get views. Many of the bands that play are only represented by part of the band, for example. In at least one instance, when singer/harpist Joanna Newsom was invited to perform, the fact that her harp would not fit in the cab kept her from contributing at all.\n\nThe Black Cab Sessions were conceived by Jono Stevens and produced as a partnership between Hidden Fruit (Gen Stevens and Chris Pattinson) and Just So Films (Jonny Madderson and Will Evans).\n\nOne of the producers reports that about 10 percent of the cab drivers approached by the producers turns them down, thinking that the idea is weird, but that those who do participate enjoy it.\n\nFilming of the Black Cab Sessions began in May, 2007 and is ongoing.\n\nThe following artists have performed in the Black Cab Sessions:\n\n"}

Animated cartoon pornography or erotic animation is a subset of the larger field of adult animation, not all of which is sexually explicit.\n\nBecause historically most cartoons have been produced for child and all-ages audiences, cartoon pornography has sometimes been subject to criticism and extra scrutiny compared to live-action erotic films or photographs. It is somewhat common in Japan, where it is part of a genre of entertainment commonly referred to outside of Japan as \"hentai\".\n\nOne of the earliest examples of erotic animation is \"The Virgin with the Hot Pants\", a stag film that opens with an animated sequence featuring an independent penis and testicles pursuing a naked woman and having sex with her, then another sequence of a mouse sexually penetrating a cat. Another early example is \"Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure\", a 6.5-minute silent black-and-white animated film produced in 1928 by three US animation studios, for a private party. It features a man with a large, perpetually erect penis who has various misadventures with other characters and farm animals, plus his penis detaching and doing things on its own.\n\nThe Golden Age of Porn, which saw mainstream filmmakers and cinemas tentatively experiment with sexually explicit material with fully developed plots and storytelling themes, also saw some renewed interest in similar erotic animation. Examples include O\"ut of an Old Man’s Head\" (1968) by Per Åhlin and Tage Danielsson, \"\" (1975) by Picha and Boris Szulzinger, and \"Historias de amor y masacre\" (1979) by Jorge Amorós. Animator Ralph Bakshi produced \"Fritz the Cat\" (1972) (based loosely on the comix of Robert Crumb), which was the first animated film to receive an \"X\" rating in the US. The Italian film \"Il nano e la strega\" (released in English as \"King Dick\", 1973) was a Medieval fantasy story told entirely by hand-drawn animation. \"Once Upon a Girl\" (1976) featured live-action framing sequences around pornographic versions of well-known fairy tales. \"Animerama\" was a series of animated erotic films begun by Osamu Tezuka: \"A Thousand and One Nights\" (1969), \"Cleopatra\" (1970), and \"Belladonna of Sadness\" (1973).\n\nSince the 1980s, erotica has been a popular genre of animation in Japan. Erotic Japanese \"anime\" – some based on erotic \"manga\", others as original video animation – feature sexually suggestive and explicit sex scenes. (See also: Hentai)\n\nIn the early 21st century, producers began applying digital animation technology to erotic material. In 2000, Playboy TV began running the erotic dystopian sci-fi series \"Dark Justice\", which used 3D animation, and ran for 20 episodes. In 2001, illustrator Joe Phillips released \"The House of Morecock\", a comedic erotic feature film for gay and bisexual male audiences, made using 2D digital animation.\n\nThe 2006 short \"Sex Life of Robots\" turned to the traditional technique of stop-motion animation to depict the imagined sexual activities of living robots.\n\nAnimated content has become popular on pornographic video services, which sometimes report terms such as \"anime\", \"hentai\", and \"cartoon\" – all of which are commonly associated with animation – among the top search terms.\n\nThe legal status of cartoon pornography varies from country to country. In addition to the normal legal status of pornography, much cartoon pornography depicts potentially minor [that is, underage] characters engaging in sexual acts. One of the primary reasons for this may be due to the many cartoons featuring major characters who are not adults. Cartoon pornography does not always have depictions of minors in sexual acts or situations, but that which does may fall under the jurisdiction laws concerning child pornography. Drawings of pre-existing characters can in theory be in violation of copyright law no matter the situation the characters are shown in.\n\n\n"}

In 2009 Freeverse released an updated version for the iOS.\n\nIn the PC version, gameplay consisted of setting up the car, qualifying, and then the actual race event. If the player finished in a high enough position, they would progress to the next circuit. Damage was calculated not by realistic damage displayed on the car but a \"cracked dashboard\" bar indicator, with cracks appearing along the dashboard when the player hits something.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8244", "title": "Dice", "text": "Dice\n\nDice (singular die or dice; from Old French \"dé\"; from Latin \"datum\" \"something which is given or played\") are small throwable objects that can rest in multiple positions, used for generating random numbers. Dice are suitable as gambling devices for games like craps and are also used in non-gambling tabletop games.\nA traditional die is a cube, with each of its six faces showing a different number of dots (pips) from 1 to 6. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing on its upper surface a random integer from one to six, each value being equally likely. A variety of similar devices are also described as dice; such specialized dice may have polyhedral or irregular shapes and may have faces marked with symbols instead of numbers. They may be used to produce results other than one through six. Loaded and crooked dice are designed to favor some results over others for purposes of cheating or amusement.\n\nA dice tray, a tray used to contain thrown dice, is sometimes used for gambling or board games, in particular to allow dice throws which do not interfere with other game pieces.\n\nDice have been used since before recorded history, and it is uncertain where they originated. The oldest known dice were excavated as part of a backgammon-like game set at the Burnt City, an archeological site in south-eastern Iran, estimated to be from between 2800–2500 BC. Other excavations from ancient tombs in the Indus Valley civilization indicate a South Asian origin.\n\nThe Egyptian game of Senet was played with dice. Senet was played before 3000 BC and up to the 2nd century AD. It was probably a racing game, but there is no scholarly consensus on the rules of Senet. Dicing is mentioned as an Indian game in the \"Rigveda\", \"Atharvaveda\" and the early Buddhist games list. There are several biblical references to \"casting lots\", as in Psalm 22, indicating that dicing (or a related activity) was commonplace when the psalm was composed. It is theorized that dice developed from the practice of fortunetelling with the talus of hoofed animals, colloquially known as \"knucklebones\", but knucklebones is not the oldest divination technique that incorporates randomness. Knucklebones was a game of skill played by women and children; a derivative form had the four sides of the bone receive different values and count as modern dice.\nAlthough gambling was illegal, many Romans were passionate gamblers who enjoyed dicing, which was known as \"aleam ludere\" (\"to play at dice\"). Dicing was even a popular pastime of emperors. Letters by Augustus to Tacitus and his daughter recount his hobby of dicing. There were two sizes of Roman dice. \"Tali\" were large dice inscribed with one, three, four, and six on four sides. \"Tesserae\" were smaller dice with sides numbered from one to six. Twenty-sided dice date back to the 2nd century AD and from Ptolemaic Egypt as early as the 2nd century BC.\n\nDominoes and playing cards originated in China as developments from dice. The transition from dice to playing cards occurred in China around the Tang dynasty, and coincides with the technological transition from rolls of manuscripts to block printed books. In Japan, dice were used to play a popular game called sugoroku. There are two types of sugoroku. \"Ban-sugoroku\" is similar to backgammon and dates to the Heian period, while \"e-sugoroku\" is a racing game.\n\nDice are thrown onto a surface either from the hand or from a container designed for this (such as a dice cup). The face of the die that is uppermost when it comes to rest provides the value of the throw. One typical dice game today is craps, where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to randomize moves in board games, usually by deciding the distance through which a piece will move along the board; examples of this are backgammon and \"Monopoly\".\n\nThe result of a die roll is determined by the way it is thrown, according to the laws of classical mechanics. A die roll is made random by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; they are thus a crude form of hardware random number generator. Perhaps to mitigate concerns that the pips on the faces of certain styles of dice cause a small bias, casinos use precision dice with flush markings.\n\nCommon dice are small cubes most commonly across, whose faces are numbered from one to six, usually by patterns of round dots called pips. (While the use of Arabic numerals is occasionally seen, such dice are less common.)\n\nOpposite sides of a modern die traditionally add up to seven, implying that the 1, 2 and 3 faces share a vertex. The faces of a die may be placed clockwise or counterclockwise about this vertex. If the 1, 2 and 3 faces run counterclockwise, the die is called \"right-handed\", and if those faces run clockwise, the die is called \"left-handed\". Western dice are normally right-handed, and Chinese dice are normally left-handed.\n\nThe pips on dice are arranged in specific patterns as shown. Asian style dice bear similar patterns to Western ones, but the pips are closer to the center of the face; in addition, the pips are differently sized on Asian style dice, and the pips are colored red on the 1 and 4 sides. One possible explanation is that red fours are of Indian origin. In some older sets, the \"one\" pip is a colorless depression.\n\nNon-precision dice are manufactured via the plastic injection molding process. The pips or numbers on the die are a part of the mold. The coloring for numbering is achieved by submerging the die entirely in paint, which is allowed to dry. The die is then polished via a tumble finishing process similar to rock polishing. The abrasive agent scrapes off all of the paint except for the indents of the numbering. A finer abrasive is then used to polish the die. This process also creates the smoother, rounded edges on the dice.\n\nPrecision casino dice may have a polished or sand finish, making them transparent or translucent respectively. Casino dice have their pips drilled, then filled flush with a paint of the same density as the material used for the dice, such that the center of gravity of the dice is as close to the geometric center as possible. All such dice are stamped with a serial number to prevent potential cheaters from substituting a die. Precision backgammon dice are made the same way; they tend to be slightly smaller and have rounded corners and edges, to allow better movement inside the dice cup and stop forceful rolls from damaging the playing surface.\n\nWhile the terms \"ace\", \"deuce\", \"trey\", \"cater\", \"cinque\" and \"sice\" are generally obsolete, with the names of the numbers preferred, they are still used by some professional gamblers to designate different sides of the dice. \"Ace\" is from the Latin \"as\", meaning \"a unit\"; the others are 2 to 6 in Old French.\n\nUsing Unicode characters, the faces ⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅, can be shown in text using the range U+2680 to U+2685 or using decimal codice_1 to codice_2.\n\nA loaded, weighted, or crooked die is one that has been tampered with so that it will land with a specific side facing upwards more or less often than a fair die would. There are several methods for creating loaded dice, including rounded faces, off-square faces and weights. Transparent cellulose acetate dice are used by casinos as tampering is more apparent than with opaque dice.\n\nAround the end of the 1960s, non-cubical dice became popular among players of wargames, and since have been employed extensively in role-playing games and trading card games. The numerals 6 and 9, which are reciprocally symmetric through rotation, are distinguished with a dot or underline.\n\nDice are often sold in sets, matching in color, of six different shapes. Five of the dice are shaped like the Platonic solids, whose faces are regular polygons. Aside from the cube, the other four Platonic solids have 4, 8, 12, and 20 faces, allowing for those number ranges to be generated. The only other common non-cubical die is the 10-sided die, a pentagonal trapezohedron die, whose faces are ten kites, each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices. Such sets frequently include a second 10-sided die either of contrasting color or numbered by tens, allowing for a pair of 10-sided dice to generate numbers between 1 and 100.\n\nUsing these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate the real probability distributions of the events they simulate. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a uniform distribution of random percentages, and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to normal distributions. \n\nUnlike other common dice, a four-sided die does not have a side that faces upward when it is at rest on a surface, so it has to be read in a different way. Many such dice have the numbers printed around the points, so that when it settles, the numbers at the vertex pointing up are the same and are read. Alternatively, the numbers on a tetrahedral die can be placed at the middles of the edges, in which case the numbers around the base are read.\n\nNormally, the faces on a die will be placed so opposite faces will add up to one more than the number of faces (this is not possible with 4-sided dice and dice with an odd-number of faces). Some dice, such as those with 10 sides, are usually numbered sequentially beginning with 0, in which case the opposite faces will add to one less than the number of faces.\n\n\"Uniform fair dice\" are dice where all faces have equal probability of outcome due to the symmetry of the die as it is face-transitive. Theoretically, this includes:\n\n\nLong dice can in principle be made with any number of faces, including odd numbers. They are based on the infinite set of prisms. All the rectangular faces are mutually face-transitive, so they are equally probable. The two ends of the prism may be rounded or capped with a pyramid, designed so that the die cannot rest on those faces. 4-sided long dice are easier to roll than tetrahedra, and are used in the traditional board games dayakattai and daldøs.\n\nThe faces of most dice are labelled using sequences of whole numbers, usually starting at one, expressed with either pips or digits. However, there are some applications that require results other than numbers. Examples include letters for Boggle, directions for \"Warhammer Fantasy Battle\", Fudge dice, playing card symbols for poker dice, and instructions for sexual acts using sex dice.\n\nDice may have numbers that do not form a counting sequence starting at one. One variation on the standard die is known as the \"average\" die. These are six-sided dice with sides numbered codice_3, which have the same arithmetic mean as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have a narrower range of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top wargames, where a narrower range of numbers is required. Other numbered variations include Sicherman dice and nontransitive dice.\n\nA die can be constructed in the shape of a sphere, with the addition of an internal cavity in the shape of the dual polyhedron of the desired die shape and an internal weight. The weight will settle in one of the points of the internal cavity, causing it to settle with one of the numbers uppermost. For instance, a sphere with an octahedral cavity and a small internal weight will settle with one of the 6 points of the cavity held downwards by the weight.\n\nPolyhedral dice are commonly used in role-playing games. The fantasy role-playing game \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (D&D) is largely credited with popularizing dice in such games. Some games use only one type, like \"Exalted\" which uses only ten-sided dice. Others use numerous types for different game purposes, such as D&D, which makes use of all common polyhedral dice. Dice are usually used to determine the outcome of events. Games typically determine results either as a total on one or more dice above or below a fixed number, or a certain number of rolls above a certain number on one or more dice. Due to circumstances or character skill, the initial roll may have a number added to or subtracted from the final result, or have the player roll extra or fewer dice. To keep track of rolls easily, dice notation is frequently used.\n\nMany board games use dice to randomize how far pieces move or to settle conflicts. Typically, this has meant that rolling higher numbers is better. Some games, such as Axis & Allies, have inverted this system by making the lower values more potent. In the modern age, a few games and game designers have approached dice in a different way by making each side of the die similarly valuable. In Castles of Burgundy, players spend their dice to take actions based on the die's value. In this game, a six is not better than a one, or vice versa. In Quarriors (and its descendent, Dicemasters), different sides of the dice can offer completely different abilities. Several sides often give resources while others grant the player useful actions.\n\nDice can be used for divination and using dice for such a purpose is called cleromancy. A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this method of divination. It is highly likely that the Pythagoreans used the Platonic solids as dice. They referred to such dice as \"the dice of the gods\" and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.\n\nAstrological dice are a specialized set of three 12-sided dice for divination; the first die represents planets, the Sun, the Moon, and the nodes of the Moon, the second die represents the 12 zodiac signs, and the third represents the 12 houses. A specialized icosahedron die provides the answers of the Magic 8-Ball, conventionally used to provide answers to yes-or-no questions.\n\nDice can be used to generate random numbers for use in passwords and cryptography applications. The Electronic Frontier Foundation describes a method by which dice can be used to generate passphrases.\n\nIn many gaming contexts, especially tabletop role-playing games, shorthand notations representing different dice rolls are used. A \"d\" or \"D\" is used to indicate a die with a specific number of sides; for example, codice_4 denotes a four-sided die. If several dice of the same type are to be rolled, this is indicated by a leading number specifying the number of dice. Hence, codice_5 means the player should roll six eight-sided dice and add the results. Modifiers to a die roll can also be indicated as desired. For example, codice_6 instructs the player to roll three six-sided dice, calculate the total, and add four to it.\n\n\n"}

The term contrasts this computer file with the physical copy (typically a DVD or Blu-ray Disc) with which the Digital Copy is usually offered as part of a bundle. It allows the disc's purchaser to create a single copy of the film on a computer, and to view it on that computer's display or an external display (e.g. television) connected to that computer. \"Digital Copy\" is also commonly referred to as \"Digital HD\" (where it is referencing a high-definition Digital Copy), or \"4K UHD\" (in 4K resolution ultra high definition, possibly boxed with a Blu-ray of the same resolution).\n\nThere are two types of Digital Copy. The first is a copy made in advance and included on the disc. The second is created dynamically from the DVD content itself. In both scenarios the publisher decides which content, formats, digital rights management (DRM) systems and technical parameters are used for the Digital Copy. Digital Copy systems based on existing pregenerated files are less flexible than dynamic transcoding solutions.\n\nDigital Copy files based on existing files include only one audio track and no subtitles, although the DVD itself may have multiple audio tracks and multiple subtitles. Also, the quality is limited by the bitrate used to encode the file which is typically relatively low and not adjusted to the device to be transferred to.\n\nDigital Copy files based on transcoding solutions can use the correct audio track and subtitle based on the user's location or choice and individually create the digital copy based on the target device properties (video and audio bitrate, display resolution, aspect ratio).\n\nMost often, Digital Copy solutions offer Windows Media or Apple iTunes files with their respective DRM services, Windows Media DRM and FairPlay. Other solutions also provide support for Sony PlayStation Portable and phones using 3GP video files and Open Mobile Alliance DRM. Some publishers limit their digital copies to Microsoft operating systems and devices. Linux-based desktop operating systems are unable to play this content. Apple computers and devices are not supported by their digital solution.\n\nTo limit the number of free copies, the disc typically comes with a single-use code to authenticate a computer over the Internet. Alternatively, content owners can offer the Digital Copy feature as a paid service. Often the authentication code has an expiration date, rendering the copy invalid if it is used after that time.\n\nTechnology industry analyst Michael Gartenberg described the Digital Copy initiative as \"a smart move\" providing an easier alternative to customers compared to converting the files themselves using software such as HandBrake. Gartenberg was critical of Sony for restricting themselves to files for the PlayStation Portable that were not widely compatible with more popular personal media devices.\n\nFred von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation described Digital Copy schemes as \"stealing your fair use rights and selling them back to you piecemeal\", disputing claims by Hollywood studios that it is illegal for customers to rip a personal copy of a DVD to put on a portable video player, even if they own the DVD. Jon Healey of the Los Angeles Times pointed out that, with DVDs, consumers were being asked to pay more for uses they had before at no extra cost with CDs and cassette tapes.\n\nSteven J. Vaughan-Nichols of ComputerWorld.com describes Digital Copy as \"nonsense, a feature that is no feature at all.\" He criticizes it as an attempt by the industry to sugar-coat DRM, complaining that viewers should be able to watch the movie they have bought on any device they want, and that media companies should change their business plans to meet their customers' legitimate needs.\n\n\n"}

It focuses on Wayne Szalinski, an eccentric inventor who develops electronic machines that cause havoc.\n\nThe original film, \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\", was released in 1989 by Walt Disney Pictures. Written by Stuart Gordon, Ed Naha, Brian Yuzna, and Tom Schulman, it has been one of Disney's most successful franchises.\n\nWayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is an eccentric professor who makes a living by inventing machines in his attic while not at work. He lives at home with his wife, Diane (Marcia Strassman), a real-estate agent, and his two kids, Amy and Nick. He and Diane had an argument a previous night. While she is selling a house, he accidentally shrinks his and the neighbors' (Matt Frewer and Kristine Sutherland) kids and sends them to his overgrowing backyard with the trash. They try to make their way across what seems like miles of grass, ants, bees, scorpions, and a lawn mower. They find their way back to the house and end up going back to normal size.\n\nWayne has moved the family to Nevada and still invents things. The Szalinski's have a new baby boy, Adam, who is now two years old. Amy is leaving for college and Diane helps her get settled into her dorm, and Nick (Robert Oliveri) is going crazy over a girl at school named Mandy (Keri Russell) despite her not noticing. While Wayne is at work, Adam is accidentally zapped by a machine in his lab. Everywhere there is an Electro-Magnetic Flux, he soon grows bigger and bigger and soon heads to the neon lights of Las Vegas. Mandy the babysitter gets mixed up in the crisis and along with Nick gets placed into Adam's Pocket. Wayne and Diane retrieve the shrinking Machine from the first film, and soon the police, the Federal Marshals, Sterling Labs and other officials take notice and try to help. He is soon back to his normal size again.\n\nWayne is now banned from using his shrink ray by joint committee of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Diane (Eve Gordon). Nick is now away at college and Adam (Bug Hall) is ten years old. Diane is planning a vacation with Patti (Robin Bartlett), her sister-in-law, while Wayne and his brother, Gordon (Stuart Pankin), watch Adam and his cousins (Allison Mack and Jake Richardson). While tampering with the shrink ray, Wayne accidentally shrinks himself, Diane, Gordon, and Patti. The kids have a party in the house after thinking they have it to themselves. The adults try their hardest to get the kids' attention and finally do near the end of the movie.\n\nIn February 2018, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" revealed that remakes of several films are in development as exclusive content for Walt Disney Studios' upcoming streaming service Disney+; with one of those named in the announcement being \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\".\n\n\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" opened on June 23, 1989 to 1,498 theatres. It grossed $130,742,172 domestic and $92,000,000 overseas totaling to $222,724,172, one of the highest grossing Disney films, making it very successful. Reviews were generally positive and Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a \"fresh\" 72% rating. \"Honey, I Blew Up the Kid\" opened on July 17, 1992 to 2,429 theatres, almost double the original film. It grossed $58,662,452 domestic. It received mixed reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and received 40% \"rotten\". The next film in franchise was released direct-to-video.\n\nA syndicated series was produced in 1997, featuring Peter Scolari taking on the role of Wayne. The Szalinski family has moved from Nevada to Matheson, Colorado. The Disney Channel picked up the series and produced it until it was cancelled in 2000, due to Disney's unwritten policy of not producing shows after 65 episodes. It was last seen on the air during early mornings in 2004. Barbara Alyn Woods, Hillary Tuck, and Thomas Dekker also star as Diane, Amy, and Nick Szalinski.\n\nA 3D attraction called \"Honey, I Shrunk the Audience\" debuted at Epcot in 1994 and ran at Disney theme parks until 2010. Rick Moranis, Marcia Strassman, Robert Oliveri, and the Shalikar twins reprise their roles from the films. While being given an award by Dr. Nigel Channing (Eric Idle) about his shrink ray, Wayne accidentally shrinks the audience and sends them on an adventure with rats, snakes, and babies.\n\nIn 1999, \"Journey into Imagination\" was rethemed and featured Dr. Nigel Channing, from \"Honey, I Shrunk the Audience!\", with the purple dragon Figment in a show retitled as \"Journey into Imagination with Figment\". Dr. Channing also hosts an area known as the \"Imagination Institute\". His grandfather created the institute and features Wayne Szalinski and Dr. Philip Brainard (from \"Flubber\") as the recipients of the \"Inventor of the Year\" award. Walt Disney and Thomas Edison also make an appearance.\n\nAnother attraction, \"\", was a playground at Disney's Hollywood Studios designed to look like the outdoor backyard of the first film.

{"id": "2315586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2315586", "title": "Kusemai", "text": "Kusemai\n\nKusemai (曲舞, くせまい)　is a dance-like art form originating from medieval Japan (roughly, the Kamakura and Muromachi Periods). It was particularly popular during Japan’s Nanboku Period (CE1336-1392) up through the end of the rest of the Muromachi Period (CE 1336-1573). Kusemai is sometimes simply characterized as a Japanese form of song and dance with a strong irregular beat - emphasis is placed on the beat at the expense of the melody. \n\nKusemai is sometimes referred to in classical and medieval Japanese simply as \"mai\" (舞), or “dance.” While the modern Japanese kanji spelling of kusemai is 曲舞, written variants of the \"kanji\" are found in written records as 久世 舞 (kuse-mai) and 九世 舞 (kuse-mai). The “dance,” or pre-arranged physical movements of kusemai, are widely held to be the root of \"kōwakamai\"’s dance-element.\n\nThe type of music that accompanies the kusemai performance particularly flourished around Kyoto and Nara, in the 14th and 15th centuries. The name can be roughly translated as \"peculiar/unconventional dance.\" Although dance was originally involved with the performance, it was of minor importance, and probably involved the performer simply stamping the beat.\n\nKusemai’s origins are unknown but it appears to have started in the late 15th to early 16th centuries. A Muromachi Period illustration titled \"Shichijuuichi-ban shokunin utaawase\" (七十一番職人歌合) depicts a kusemai performer in contrast to another \"shirabyōshi\" (白拍子) performer. Since the garments and musical accompaniment of both kusemai and shirabyōshi, which came about at the end of the Heian Period, are so similar some scholars believe that shirabyōshi is the root of kusemai.\n\nA kusemai performance consists of a story/narrative tale and rhythmic musical accompaniment. The performer recites the narrative lines while dancing to the music [performed by separate musicians]. The dancer was either a man or a young boy (\"chigo\", 稚児).\n\nThe young boy-dancer costume consisted of \"suikan\" (水干, Heian period-style garments), \"ōguchi\" (大口, a long, loose fitted, pleated skirt), and tall style \"eboshi\" cap. Adult male dancers wore warrior-class garments called \"hitatare\" (直垂) in place of suikan. Dancers also held a folding fan which served as a basic performance prop.\n\nThere are also performances called \"onna no kusemai\" (女曲舞) or \"jokyokumai\" (女曲舞) in which women wear the male performer’s clothes and perform kusemai.\n\nThe kusemai “Yamauba” and “Hyakuman” are said to be the oldest performances of kusemai, having been transmitted from time immemorial to the present. Also, kōwakamai, which is sometimes considered a style of kusemai, is known to have been created sometime in the Muromachi Period and has been passed down to the present day.\n\nEncyclopædia Britannica 2005 \"Ultimate Reference Suite\" DVD, article- \"Kan'ami\"\n\n\"The Structure of Kusemai\" [Qu] [wu] P.

Located on the western side of Charleston on the north bank of the Kanawha River, the park was a popular destination that featured a roller coaster, a dance pavilion, a public swimming pool, a roller rink, and live entertainment. Admission to the park cost 15 cents per person; a ride on the Royal Giant Dips roller coaster cost one dime per trip. It was a trolley park served by the Charleston Interurban Railroad Company.\n\nThe primary attraction at Luna Park was the 45-foot-by-100-foot community swimming pool, which held an estimated 200,000 gallons of water. Unlike most pools of that size, the Luna Park pool was not made of concrete but of “lumber and tin sheet,” according to a report by the state Department of Health. A local newspaper reported in 1913 that 15,000 visited the park in the afternoon, followed by an evening crowd of about 16,000; street cars were carrying passengers to and from the park at a rate of about 1200 an hour. Others arrived by steamboat.\n\nIn May 1923, the Royal Giant Dips caught fire and was destroyed along with most of the park. Despite attempts by ownership to raise the money to rebuild Luna Park, it was never resurrected. Eventually, single-family housing was constructed on the park grounds.\n"}

He was born near the Oval, at 37 Glenshaw Mansions, Brixton Road, London SW9. In 1916, during a World War I air raid, Max and his elder brother Alex were saved from death by a cast iron bed frame, but his younger brother Bunty and their Aunt Betty, who was looking after them, were killed by a bomb dropped from a German Zeppelin which also destroyed their house.\n\nMax and Alex went to live with their father and his family, whilst their mother went to live with Harry Wallace, whom she had met on tour. When their father died of tuberculosis in 1920, aged 37, their mother married Harry Wallace, and they all moved to a pub in Essex.\n\nWall auditioned for a part with a touring theatre company, and made his stage début at the age of 14 as Jack in \"Mother Goose\" with a travelling pantomime company in Devon and Cornwall featuring George Lacey. In 1925 he was a speciality dancer in the London Revue at the Lyceum. He became determined not to rely on his father's name, so abbreviated Maxwell to Max, and his stepfather's name Wallace, to Wall.\n\nHe is best remembered for his ludicrously attired and hilariously strutting \"Professor Wallofski\". John Cleese has acknowledged Wall's influence on his own \"Ministry of Silly Walks\" sketch for \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". After appearing in many musicals and stage comedies in the 1930s, Wall's career went into decline, and he was reduced to working in obscure nightclubs. He then joined the Royal Air Force during World War II and served for three years until he was invalided out in 1943.\n\nWall married dancer Marion Pola and the couple had five children. In an interview with the family in the mid-1950s, \"Tit-Bits\" magazine wrote: \"The kind of private jokes you find in all the nicest families flourish with the Walls. After Max and his wife, Marion, had their first son, Michael, it seemed kind of natural to make a corner in names beginning with ‘M’, and there are now Melvyn (aged nine), Martin (nearly five) and the four-month-old twins Meredith and Maxine. ... In the same way, because the Walls, like other couples married during the war, were eventually thrilled when they found a house with four walls of their own, they decided to call it just that, only Martin arrived and made it ‘Five Walls’.\"\n\nIn 1955 Wall left Marion and became involved with Jennifer Chimes, that year's Miss Great Britain, who was 26 years his junior and married with children. The couple married in 1956, but the following year Wall collapsed on stage and suffered a nervous breakdown. Jennifer left him, and although there were reconciliations, he divorced Jennifer for desertion in 1962.\n\nWall re-emerged during the 1950s when producers and directors rediscovered his comic talents, along with the expressive power of his tragic clown face and the distinctive sad falling cadences of his voice. He secured television appearances and, having attracted Samuel Beckett's attention, he won parts in \"Waiting for Godot\" in 1979 and \"Krapp's Last Tape\" in 1984. In 1966 he appeared as Père Ubu in Jarry's \"Ubu Roi\", and in 1972 he toured with Mott the Hoople on their \"Rock n' Roll Circus Tour\", gaining a new audience. His straight acting gained him this review in 1974: \"Max Wall makes Olivier look like an amateur in \"The Entertainer\" at Greenwich Theatre...\".\n\nHe also appeared in \"Crossroads\" (as Walter Soper, 1982 to 1983), \"Coronation Street\" (as Harry Payne, 1978) and what was then \"Emmerdale Farm\" (as Arthur Braithwaite, 1978). He played ex-con Ernie Dodds in \"Minder\" in 1982, with George Cole.\n\nWall played one of the inventors in the 1968 film \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" and in 1977 he was seen as King Bruno the Questionable in Terry Gilliam's film \"Jabberwocky\". In the 1970s and 80s, Wall occasionally performed a one-man stage show, \"Aspects of Max Wall\", in which he recaptured the humour of old-time music hall theatre.\n\nOn 1 April 1977, Wall's version of Ian Dury's song \"England's Glory\" (which featured in Dury's stage show \"Apples\") was issued on Stiff Records (BUY 12), backed with \"Dream Tobacco\" and given away with the album \"Hits Greatest Stiffs\". Wall also appeared onstage with Dury at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1978, but was poorly received, and said \"They only want the walk\".\n\nBetween 1982 and 1984 he appeared as Tombs in the BBC Two adaptation of \"Jane\" based on the \"Daily Mirror\" comic-strip character and filmed with similar \"comic-strip frames\". In the second series his place in the castlist was upgraded to second, after Glynis Barber.\n\nHis last film appearance was in 1989 in the 12-minute film \"A Fear of Silence\", a dark tale of a man who drives a stranger to a confession of murder by answering only \"yes\" or \"no\" to his questions; those two words, repeated, were his only dialogue. The film won a gold award in the \"New York Film and TV Festival\".\n\nOn the afternoon of 20 May 1990 Wall fell at Simpson's-in-the-Strand in central London, fracturing his skull. He was conveyed by ambulance to Westminster Hospital in an unconscious state, but never regained consciousness, and died there early in the next morning, at the age of 82. His body was buried at Highgate Cemetery.\n\nWall was survived by four sons, Michael, Melvyn, Martin and Meredith, and a daughter, Maxine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "494587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=494587", "title": "Medea (play)", "text": "Medea (play)\n\nMedea (, \"Mēdeia\") is an ancient Greek tragedy written by Euripides, based upon the myth of Jason and Medea and first produced in 431 BC. The plot centers on the actions of Medea, a former princess of the \"barbarian\" kingdom of Colchis, and the wife of Jason; she finds her position in the Greek world threatened as Jason leaves her for a Greek princess of Corinth. Medea takes vengeance on Jason by murdering Jason's new wife as well as her own children, after which she escapes to Athens to start a new life.\n\n\"Medea\" and the suite of plays that it accompanied in the City Dionysia was not well received at its original performance. The play was re-discovered in Augustan drama, and again in 16th-century Europe, from which time it remained part of the tragedic repertoire, and became a classic of the Western canon and has remained the most frequently performed Greek tragedy through the 20th century. It experienced renewed interest in the feminist movement of the late 20th century, being interpreted as a nuanced and sympathetic portrayal of Medea's struggle to take charge of her own life in a male-dominated world. The play holds the American Tony award record for most wins for the same female lead character, with Judith Anderson winning in 1948, Zoe Caldwell in 1982, and Diana Rigg in 1994.\n\n\"Medea\" was first performed in 431 BC at the City Dionysia festival. Here every year three playwrights competed against each other, each writing a tetralogy of three tragedies and a satyr play (alongside \"Medea\" were \"Philoctetes\", \"Dictys\" and the satyr play \"Theristai\"). In 431 the competition was among Euphorion (the son of famed playwright Aeschylus), Sophocles (Euripides' main rival) and Euripides. Euphorion won, and Euripides placed last.\n\nWhile \"Medea\" is considered one of the great plays of the Western canon, the Athenian audience did not react so favorably, and it placed third out of the three competing plays at the Dionysia festival of 431 BC. A possible explanation is found in a scholium to line 264 of the play, which asserts that Medea's children were traditionally killed by the Corinthians after her escape; Euripides' apparent invention of Medea's filicide might have offended its audience just as his first treatment of the Hippolytus myth did. That Euripides and others took liberties with Medea's story may be inferred from the 1st century BC historian Diodorus Siculus: \"Speaking generally, it is because of the desire of the tragic poets for the marvellous that so varied and inconsistent an account of Medea has been given out.\" A common urban legend claimed that Euripides put the blame on Medea because the Corinthians have bribed him with a sum of five talents.\n\nIn the 4th century BC, South-Italian vase painting offers a number of Medea-representations that are connected to Euripides' play — the most famous is a krater in Munich. However, these representations always differ considerably from the plots of the play or are too general to support any direct link to the play of Euripides – this might reflect the judgement on the play. However, the violent and powerful character of princess Medea, and her double nature — both loving and destructive — became a standard for the later periods of antiquity and seems to have inspired numerous adaptations.\n\nWith the rediscovery of the text in 1st-century Rome (the play was adapted by the tragedians Ennius, Lucius Accius, Ovid, Seneca the Younger and Hosidius Geta, among others), again in 16th-century Europe.\n\nIn 20th-century modern literary criticism, \"Medea\" and its \"universal themes of revenge and justice in an unjust society\" have provoked differing reactions from differing critics and writers.\n\nThe form of the play differs from many other Greek tragedies by its simplicity: All scenes involve only two actors, Medea and someone else. The Chorus (A staple in Greek theater) would also usually be involved along with those two, representing the women of Corinth. These encounters serve to highlight Medea's skill and determination in manipulating powerful male figures to achieve her own ends. The play is also the only Greek tragedy in which a kin-killer makes it unpunished to the end of the play, and the only one about child-killing in which the deed is performed in cold blood as opposed to in a state of temporary madness.\n\nEuripides' characterization of Medea exhibits the inner emotions of passion, love, and vengeance. \nThe character of Medea has variously been interpreted as either fulfilling her role of \"mother and wife\" and as acting as a \"proto-feminist\". \nFeminist readings have interpreted the play as either a \"sympathetic exploration\" of the \"disadvantages of being a woman in a patriarchal society\", or as an expression of misogynist attitudes. \nIn conflict with this sympathetic undertone (or reinforcing a more negative reading) is Medea's barbarian identity, which would antagonize a 5th-century Greek audience.\n\n\"Medea\" is centered on a wife’s calculated desire for revenge against her unfaithful husband. The play is set in Corinth some time after Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece, where he met Medea. The play begins with Medea in a blind rage towards Jason for arranging to marry Glauce, the daughter of Creon (king of Corinth). The nurse, overhearing Medea’s grief, fears what she might do to herself or her children.\n\nCreon, in anticipation of Medea’s wrath, arrives and reveals his plans to send her into exile. Medea pleads for one day’s delay and eventually Creon acquiesces. In the next scene Jason arrives to explain his rationale for his apparent betrayal. He explains that he couldn’t pass up the opportunity to marry a royal princess, as Medea is only a barbarian woman, but hopes to someday join the two families and keep Medea as his mistress. Medea, and the chorus of Corinthian women, do not believe him. She reminds him that she left her own people for him (\"I am the mother of your children. Whither can I fly, since all Greece hates the barbarian?\"), and that she saved him and slew the dragon. Jason promises to support her after his new marriage, but Medea spurns him: \"Marry the maid if thou wilt; perchance full soon thou mayst rue thy nuptials.\"\n\nIn the following scene Medea encounters Aegeus, King of Athens. He reveals to her that despite his marriage he is still without children. He visited the oracle who merely told him that he was instructed “not to unstop the wineskin’s neck.” Medea relays her current situation to him and begs for Aegeus to let her stay in Athens if she gives him drugs to end his infertility. Aegeus, unaware of Medea’s plans for revenge, agrees.\n\nMedea then returns to plotting the murders of Glauce and Creon. She decides to poison some golden robes (a family heirloom and gift from the sun god Helios) and a coronet, in hopes that the bride will not be able to resist wearing them, and consequently be poisoned. Medea resolves to kill her own children as well, not because the children have done anything wrong, but because she feels it is the best way to hurt Jason. She calls for Jason once more and, in an elaborate ruse, apologizes to him for overreacting to his decision to marry Glauce. When Jason appears fully convinced that she regrets her actions, Medea begins to cry in mourning of her exile. She convinces Jason to allow her to give the robes to Glauce in hopes that Glauce might get Creon to lift the exile. Eventually Jason agrees and allows their children to deliver the poisoned robes as the gift-bearers.\n\nIn the next scene a messenger recounts Glauce and Creon’s deaths. When the children arrived with the robes and coronet, Glauce gleefully put them on and went to find her father. Soon the poisons overtook Glauce and she fell to the floor, dying horribly and painfully. Creon clutched her tightly as he tried to save her and, by coming in contact with the robes and coronet, got poisoned and died as well.\n\nWhile Medea is pleased with her current success she decides to take it one step forward. Since Jason brought shame upon her for trying to start a new family, Medea resolves to destroy the family he was willing to give up by killing their sons. Medea does have a moment of hesitation when she considers the pain that her children’s deaths will put her through. However, she steels her resolve to cause Jason the most pain possible and rushes offstage with a knife to kill her children. As the chorus laments her decision, the children are heard screaming. Jason then rushes onto the scene to confront Medea about murdering Creon and Glauce and he quickly discovers that his children have been killed as well. Medea then appears above the stage with the bodies of her children in the chariot of the sun god Helios. When this play was put on, this scene was accomplished using the \"mechane\" device usually reserved for the appearance of a god or goddess. She confronts Jason, reveling in his pain at being unable to ever hold his children again:\n\nShe escapes to Athens with the bodies. The chorus is left contemplating the will of Zeus in Medea's actions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The series premiered on September 23, 1961.\n\nPreviously, movies on television were usually low-cost B films or older films that the major studios or producers no longer found suitable for theatrical presentation. In the earliest years of television, major studios wouldn't release films to television; by the late 1950s, however, major studios began making movies available to the new medium, but a gentleman's agreement between the top studios kept movies made after 1948 by major studios off of the home screen. Movie audiences had grown to expect films to be shown in widescreen and in color, so older black-and-white Academy ratio films had lost much of their value to the theatres. By the late-1950s, with the exception of some of Walt Disney's films and \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939), these older films had become standard fare for independent stations and the non-prime time schedules of the network affiliates.\n\nUp until the early 1970s, the time span between a film's theatrical release and its appearance on commercial network television was much longer. Whereas today it can take as brief a period as three years before a theatrical film shows up on commercial television, between 1954 and 1972 a theatrical motion picture (even a relatively recent one) usually had to wait as many as twelve years (as in the case of the 1959 \"Ben-Hur\") before it turned up on the home screen.\n\nA short-lived black-and-white ABC-TV series entitled \"Famous Film Festival\" had premiered in the fall of 1955, but had shown British films made in the 1940s and early 1950s. In 1957, ABC broadcast \"Hollywood Film Theater\", which also featured some pre-1948 films produced by RKO Radio Pictures. RKO decided to sell some of their \"better\" pre-1948 movies to ABC while other films would be syndicated to local TV stations. Films in both series were shown in a ninety-minute time slot, which meant that some of the films had to either be severely edited or shown in two parts. \"NBC Saturday Night at the Movies\" was the first network movie anthology series to run two hours (and occasionally longer), so that almost all of the films could be shown in one evening, and edited (especially in later years) only to remove objectionable content.\n\nFor its 1961 television season, NBC obtained the rights to broadcast 31 post-1950 movie titles from 20th Century Fox, although only 30 were actually telecast that season. One film, \"The Seven Year Itch\", was held off by the network until the start of the 1963 season. On September 23, 1961, \"Saturday Night at the Movies\" premiered with the 1953 Marilyn Monroe - Lauren Bacall - Betty Grable film \"How to Marry a Millionaire\", presented \"In Living Color\". Some of the other movies shown were \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (March 3, 1962) and \"No Highway in the Sky\" (March 24, 1962). Many of these films, having been made in Cinemascope, a Fox specialty from 1953 to 1967, had to be severely panned-and-scanned for television viewing (which was the only kind of television aspect ratio in existence then). That initial deal with Fox ended up lasting three seasons (1961-64) with a total of around 90 films, including those run on Monday nights beginning in February 1963. And when the studio found greener pastures over at rival ABC, the network found releases from studios such as MGM and Paramount eager to provide content. Because commercial breaks were shorter than today (running from one minute to a maximum of two), films running less than two hours sometimes ended before the close of the program. The remaining time was filled up with theatrical trailers of upcoming films scheduled to be shown on the series in the next two or three weeks. By about 1968, this was no longer necessary, as films and commercial breaks had become longer.\n\nThe three major commercial networks did not show worn-out 16 mm prints of films as was then the usual practice on local TV stations. The films which aired on the network movie anthology series (as well as annually-telecast specials such as \"The Wizard of Oz\") were 35mm prints invariably in excellent condition. With the advent of cable television, VHS, and DVD, the idea of always showing films - even very old ones - in pristine, remastered condition on television has become the norm, but aside from films shown on the three major networks, this was simply not done prior to the 1980s. Up until then local stations had to settle for inexpensive 16 mm prints of such relatively recent films as \"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison\" (1957) or \"Prince Valiant\" (1954), rather than good \"theater-quality\" prints as seen on the networks. Unlike the major networks, nearly all local stations used 16 mm film chains.\n\n\nWith the demand for movies increasing during the 1960s, made-for-television films would soon be created by NBC, along with some help from now-sister company Universal. The first, made during the 1963–64 season, was to have been a new version of Ernest Hemingway's \"The Killers\" with Lee Marvin, Angie Dickinson and future US President Ronald Reagan, but NBC deemed the film too violent for television, so it was released in theaters instead. It was Reagan's last film before he entered politics.\n\nAlthough there had been filmed feature-length television specials such as \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\" (1957), a 1960 Hallmark Hall of Fame \"Macbeth\" filmed in color on location in Scotland, and, as early as 1954, a filmed musical version in color of Charles Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\" telecast on CBS's \"Shower of Stars\", the film generally regarded as the first made-for-television movie was \"See How They Run\", directed by David Lowell Rich and starring John Forsythe and Senta Berger. It first aired on October 7, 1964 and ushered in a series of other TV-movies over the years, aired on NBC under the title NBC World Premiere Movie. Many of the made-for-television movies on NBC would become TV series in their own right during the late-1960s and early-1970s. One of the more famous examples was \"Fame Is the Name of the Game\" (1966), which ultimately served as the pilot episode for the 1968–71 series \"The Name of the Game\".\n\nSaturday Night at the Movies attracted sufficient ratings so that NBC and its competitors added more movie series to the prime time schedule. ABC, then a distant third in the ratings, immediately added another movie series, \"Hollywood Special\", as a mid-season replacement; however, the series, under its new title \"The ABC Sunday Night Movie\", did not become a regular television program until 1964. CBS was leading the other networks in the ratings at that time and did not immediately add a prime time movie series. However, over the next few years, each of the three networks added weeknight movies to the schedule and by 1968, there was a prime time network movie for every night of the week:\n\nThe popularity of these movie broadcasts also provided a windfall profit to the movie studios, since competitive bidding for popular movies raised the price for broadcast rights. This, in turn, made it cost effective to produce \"made for TV\" movies.\n\nThis trend continued and reached its peak in the mid-1970s, when there were 11 or more movies in the weekly network schedule - though some of the \"movies\" (like \"Columbo\") were actually just a regular television series with longer episodes.\n\nFox Network had also begun to air films in prime time, as the network has gained more and more popularity with its all-time longest running hit, \"The Simpsons\", but like the \"Big Three\" networks, Fox also has since cancelled its movie series.\n\nAs opposed to ABC, NBC and CBS, Fox aired its movies primarily on Tuesday nights at 7:00 Eastern, though sometimes due to a news broadcast or game, the day of a broadcast might have been changed.\n\nAnnouncing of opening credits and bumpers for NBC Saturday Night at the Movies was handled mainly out of NBC's Burbank studios. For years, the main announcer was Don Stanley. In later years, he alternated with Donald Rickles, Peggy Taylor and Victor Bozeman. Near the end of Saturday Night at the Movies' run, opening credits (for the series, not for the films themselves) would be handled by members of the network's New York announcing staff, including Fred Collins and Howard Reig, though the Burbank staff announcers still handled bumpers. At the beginning the announcer would say something like: \"\"NBC Saturday Night at the Movies\", a series featuring motion pictures appearing on television for the first time. Tonight...\" or \"\"NBC Saturday Night at the Movies\", the television series which each week brings you the finest in recent motion pictures. Tonight...\" Following this, the film's title and its stars would be identified. The program would then go into a commercial, and then the film would begin. The opening and closing credits for the actual films would be shown exactly as they appeared when the films were shown in theatres, not in a revised format as was done on \"The ABC Sunday Night Movie\".\n\nAs with the other movie anthology series of the time, there was no host for the program. Although an announcer's voice was heard at the beginning, the program itself simply consisted of the showing of the film and perhaps a movie trailer afterward.\n\nNBC broadcast Saturday Night at the Movies until 1978. It ran until at least October 28. Some of the other movie series on television were also cancelled by the end of the decade. However, some continued well into the 1980s and even beyond. Changes in television viewing habits, though, seemed to spell the end for many of these series. Loss of ratings for them has been attributed to increased competition from cable television, especially pay movie channels that were able to show the movies uncut and without commercial interruptions. Other factors that have led to the decline of the TV network movie presentations include the advent of home video and video rental, pay-per-view and video on demand.\n\nThe NBC Saturday Night Movie has been periodically broadcast on the namesake American television network on Saturdays 8:00 p.m.–11:00 p.m. from 2000 on, and originally had interstitials hosted by Ryan Seacrest. It was replaced by coverage of the XFL in 2001, but returned the next year without host continuity, and by 2006 the network decided to only occasionally air theatrical films during sweeps weeks in various timeslots, so the Saturday movie has been completely discontinued. In 2009 and 2010, Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble purchased some Friday and Saturday night time on NBC and Fox to broadcast television films they produced such as \"The Jensen Project\", though the ratings for these films were well below regular programming and like strategies pursued by Mattel with Nickelodeon with the Barbie series of films, mainly aired to sell those films on DVD in-store. The P&G/Wal-Mart series of films was eventually discontinued, with Wal-Mart eventually being one of the main sponsors of NBC's live musical event \"The Sound of Music Live!\" in December 2013.\n\nOccasionally, any one of the major commercial networks still observes the time-honored custom of showing a recent box office and critical smash as a movie special. This pre-empts regular programming, as CBS did on Sunday, May 20, 2007, with a three-hour commercial network telecast of \"Million Dollar Baby\", and as ABC did on September 14, 2009 with the first commercial television showing of \"Dreamgirls\". Such showings often occur during sweeps, in an effort to boost a network's viewer ratings.\n\nSince the late 2000s, film rights purchased earlier in the decade by broadcast networks have mainly been burned off on Saturday nights or other unusual timeslots such as Sunday afternoon for ABC, with only a few select event films such as \"The Sound of Music\", \"Titanic\" and \"The Ten Commandments\" remaining annually broadcast by networks, as cable networks such as FX/FXX, USA Network, TBS/TNT and Comedy Central have taken the market for major network film premieres.\n\n"}
{"id": "22015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22015", "title": "Neopets", "text": "Neopets\n\nNeopets (originally \"NeoPets\") is a virtual pet website. Users can own virtual pets (\"Neopets\"), and buy virtual items for them using one of two virtual currencies. One currency, called Neopoints, can be earned within the site, and the other, Neocash, can either be purchased with real-world money, or won by chance in-game.\n\nThe website was launched by Adam Powell and Donna Williams in late 1999. Two years later, a consortium of investors led by Doug Dohring bought a controlling interest in the company and in June 2005, Viacom bought \"Neopets\" Inc. for US$160 million. On March 17, 2014, Viacom sold Neopets to Knowledge Adventure for an unannounced amount.\n\n\"Neopets\" allows users to create and care for digital pets called \"Neopets\" and explore the virtual world of Neopia. There is no set objective for the users, but they are expected to feed and care for their Neopets when they grow hungry or ill. Neopets will not die if neglected, but their health can limit their gameplay. Neopets come in a variety of species and colors and users can create or adopt their own. Users can obtain items to interact with their Neopet, such as books to read and toys to play with them. Neopets can be customised with certain clothing items, paint brushes, transformation potions, and accessories. Users can build a customisable Neohome for their Neopets and furnish it with furniture, wallpaper, and flooring. Neopets can battle against other Neopets or non-player characters in the Battledome but they cannot die there.\n\nNeopia is a virtual planet with fantasy lands inhabited by Neopets and other virtual creatures. Each land has a different theme, such as pirates or prehistory, and their own shops, games, and attractions. Neopia follows its own calendar and time zone, which runs concurrent with real-world Pacific Time, and has tie-ins with certain real world holidays such as Halloween and Christmas. It has its own economy and stock market based on Neopoints. Users can earn Neopoints through various means including playing games and selling items, which can be invested or used to buy various virtual goods and services. While there is no set objective for users, interactive storylines are sometimes released that introduce changes to the planet such as new lands.\n\nThe site is regularly updated with features like new games, items and content. In addition to the site content updated by the \"Neopets\" staff members, users also contribute content to the site. User contributions come in the form of prescreened submissions and readily editable content that is automatically filtered, such as the site's weekly electronic newspaper \"The Neopian Times\". There are different types of submissions that will be accepted.\n\nUsers can earn Neopoints from playing games. Games come in many different genres, which include action, puzzles, and luck & chance. Most games have a set maximum earnings or playtime. Players may also earn trophies and other awards from games if they score high enough or perform better than other users. Many single-player and multi-player browser games are available. Users can also participate in contests and spotlights judged by staff to showcase the users' talents. Quests to retrieve items may also be performed for specific NPCs. Challenges may be made against other players or random players in a \"World Challenge\" for a prize piece and Neopoints from the jackpot for certain Flash games. Monthly competitions also exist for multiplayer games with four week-long elimination rounds.\n\nThe economy is based on Neopoints. Users can also exchange real money for Neocash, used exclusively for the NC Mall. Users can earn Neopoints through playing games, selling items, and other transactions. Once earned, they can be saved in the bank, used to buy items from other users or non-player character (NPC) shops, used to buy and sell stocks in the Neopian stock market called the NEODAQ, or used to buy various other things. Items can be bought from shops found throughout the world of Neopia that are run by NPCs who may allow bargaining. Users can open their own shops to sell items, sometimes after obtaining those items at a lower price from sources such as other shops or charities. Items may also be exchanged through trade or auction.\n\n\"Neopets\" has a community for users to chat with and contact other users. Each user has their own profile they can edit with HTML and CSS and are represented by avatars provided by the website, as users cannot upload their own. Most avatars must be \"unlocked\" by completing certain in-game tasks, such as winning a contest or getting a high score on a game.\n\nUsers may request other users to be \"Neofriends\" or block other users from contacting them. To comply with COPPA, users under 13 years of age cannot access any of the site's communication features without sending in parental consent via fax. The main features include:\n\n\nDiscussions through these features are restricted and may not involve topics such as dating and romance or controversial topics like politics and religion. Continuous moderation is performed by paid \"Neopets\" staff members, and users can help moderate the site by reporting messages they believe are inappropriate or offensive. Messages are also automatically filtered to prevent users from posting messages with profanity or lewd content.\n\n\"Neopets\" was conceived in 1997 by Adam Powell, a British student at the University of Nottingham at the time. He shared this idea with Donna Williams and the two started work on the site in September 1999, with Powell responsible for the programming and the database and Williams the web design and art. The site launched on November 15, 1999 from offices in Portsmouth Road, Guildford, a location still commemorated on the site. Powell stated that the original goal was to \"keep university students entertained, and possibly make some cash from banner advertising\". The site contained popular culture references, such as a Neopet that was simply a picture of Bruce Forsyth.\n\nThe user base grew by word of mouth and by Christmas 1999, \"Neopets\" was logging 600,000 page views daily and sought investors to cover the high cost of running the site. Later in the month, American businessman Doug Dohring was introduced to the creators of the site and, along with other investors, bought a majority share in January of the following year. Dohring founded \"Neopets, Inc.\" in February 2000 and began business April 28. Intellectual property that did not belong to \"Neopets\" were removed but the site kept the British spellings. The website made money from the first paying customers using an advertising method trademarked as \"immersive advertising\" and touted as \"an evolutionary step forward in the traditional marketing practice of product placement\" in television and film. In 2004, \"Neopets\" released a premium version and started showing advertisements on the basic site that are not shown to premium members.\n\nMedia conglomerate Viacom purchased \"Neopets, Inc.\" on June 20, 2005 for $160 million and announced plans to focus more on the use of banner ads over the site's existing immersive advertising. The website was redesigned on April 27, 2007 and included changes to the user interface and the ability to customise Neopets. In June, Viacom promoted \"Neopets\" through minishows on Nickelodeon. Promotions included the second Altador Cup and led to an increase in traffic through the site. The first Altador Cup was released as an international online gaming event to coincide with the 2006 FIFA World Cup to improve interactivity between users and had 10.4 million participants the first year. On July 17, the NC Mall was launched in a partnership with Korean gaming company Nexon Corporation. It allowed users to use real money to purchase Neocash to buy exclusive virtual items. On June 17, 2008, Viacom formed the Nickelodeon Kids & Family Virtual Worlds Group to \"encompass all paid and subscription gaming initiatives across all relevant platforms\", including \"Neopets\". By June 2011, \"Neopets\" announced that the website had logged 1 trillion page views since its creation.\n\nIn July 2009, the \"Neopets\" site was the target of an identity theft hacking scheme that attempted to trick users into clicking a link that would allow them to gain items or Neopoints. Upon doing so, malware was installed onto the user's computer. According to reports, the hack was aimed not at child players' \"Neopets\" accounts, but at using the malware to steal the financial data and identities of their parents. Viacom stated that it was investigating the issue, and that the hack was a version of social engineering rather than an \"indictment of Neopets security practices\". In an on-site newsletter for players, \"Neopets\" denied the report and claimed that the site's security measures prevented the posting of such links.\n\nJumpStart acquired Neopets from Viacom in April 2014. Server migration began in September. JumpStart-owned Neopets was immediately characterized by glitches and site lag. On 6 March 2015, much of the Neopets Team remaining from Viacom were laid off. On July 3, 2017, Chinese company NetDragon acquired JumpStart.\n\nOn the weekend of 27–28 June 2015, the site's chat filters, designed to prevent adult language and content, stopped working. The site's forums and other user-edited spaces were flooded with adult content and obscene images.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook, JumpStart apologized, explaining that the issue was due to a \"facility move,\" and that during that move, the moderation team was not able to access the Neopets community.\n\nIn 2016, Motherboard reported that the login data of 70 million Neopets accounts was stolen. It contained not only usernames and passwords but also email addresses, birth dates, IP addresses, and PINs. It turned out this information was being stored in plain text by Neopets and had first been retrieved in 2012; every single account created prior to that year was affected. Neopets responded by posting about the leak on their official Facebook page and sent emails out to all affected players telling them to change their passwords.\n\n\"Neopets\" is consistently one of the \"stickiest\" sites for children's entertainment. Stickiness is a measure of the average amount of time spent on a website. A press release from \"Neopets\" in 2001 stated that Neopets.com led in site \"stickiness\" in May and June, with the average user spending 117 minutes a week. \"Neopets\" also led in the average number of hours spent per user per month in December 2003 with an average of 4 hours and 47 minutes. A 2004 article stated that Nielsen//NetRatings reported that people were spending around three hours a month on \"Neopets\", more than any other site in its Nielsen category. By May 2005, a \"Neopets\"-affiliated video game producer cited about 35 million unique users, 11 million unique IP addresses per month, and 4 billion web page views per month. This producer also described 20% of the users as 18 or older, with the median of the remaining 80% at about 14. \"Neopets\" was consistently ranked among the top ten \"stickiest\" sites by both Nielsen//NetRatings and comScore Media Metrix in 2005 and 2006. According to Nielsen//NetRatings, in 2007, \"Neopets\" lost about 15% of its audience over the previous year. In February 2008, comScore ranked it as the stickiest kids entertainment site with the average user spending 2 hours and 45 minutes per month.\n\nDescribed as an online cross of \"Pokémon\" and \"Tamagotchi\", \"Neopets\" has received both praise and criticism. It has been praised for having educational content. Children can learn HTML to edit their own pages. They can also learn how to handle money by participating in the economy. Reviews from About.com and MMO Hut considered the multitude of possible activities a positive aspect. Most of the users are female, higher than in other massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) but equivalent to social-networking-driven communities. Lucy Bradshaw, a vice president of Electronic Arts, attributes the popularity among girls to the openness of the site and said, \"Games that have a tendency to satisfy on more than one dimension have a tendency to have a broader appeal and attract girls\".\n\nLuck & chance games draw criticism from parents as they introduce children to gambling. In Australia, a cross-promotion with McDonald's led to controversy with \"Neopets\"' luck/chance games in October 2004. Australian tabloid television show \"Today Tonight\" featured a nine-year-old boy who claimed the site requires one to gamble in order to earn enough Neopoints to feed one's Neopet or else it would be sent to the pound. While gambling is not required, nor are pets sent to the pound if unfed, the website includes games of chance based on real games such as blackjack and lottery scratchcards. After this incident, \"Neopets\" prohibited users under the age of 13 from playing most games that involve gambling.\n\nImmersive advertising is a trademarked term for the way \"Neopets\" displayed advertisements to generate profit after Doug Dohring bought the site. Unlike pop-up and banner ads, immersive ads integrate advertisements into the site's content in interactive forms, including games and items. Players could earn Neopoints from them by playing advergames and taking part in online marketing surveys. Prior to the arrival of the NC Mall, it contributed to 60% of the revenue from the site with paying Fortune 1000 companies including Disney, General Mills, and McDonald's.\n\nIt was a contentious issue with the site with regard to the ethics of marketing to children. It drew criticism from parents, psychologists, and consumer advocates who argued that children may not know that they are being advertised to, as it blurred the line between site content and advertisement. Children under eight had difficulty recognizing ads and half a million of the 25 million users were under the age of eight in 2005. Dohring responded to such criticism stating that of the 40 percent of users twelve and younger, very few were seven or eight years old and that preschoolers were not their target audience.\n\nOthers criticised the functionality of the site. Susan Linn, another psychologist and author of \"Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood\" considered the purpose of this site was to keep children in front of advertisements. Kalle Lasn, editor-in-chief and co-founder of \"Adbusters\" magazine, said the site encouraged kids to spend hours in front of a screen and recruited them to consumerism. \"Neopets\" executives stated that paid content comprised less than 1% of the site's total content. Children were not required to play or use sponsor games and items, and all ads were marked as such.\n\nAfter Neopets was purchased by Viacom, and due to criticism towards the immersive advertising model, banner advertisements and other more clear-cut forms of advertising were integrated into the site. Neocash (discussed elsewhere in this article) was also introduced as an additional revenue source.\n\nThe popularity of \"Neopets\" spawned real-world merchandise including stickers, books, cereals, video games and more, sold at mainstream outlets and online retailers. The most common items were plushies (stuffed animals). Each piece of merchandise has a code which can be redeemed at the site for an in-game reward. \"Neopets, Inc.\" had always planned to \"bring the online and offline worlds together in ways that have never been done before\". An investment banker at Allen & Company in New York said that \"Neopets\" was the only online media he had seen \"that might have the ability to capture market share in the offline world\". Merchandise has been almost entirely discontinued save for a line of enamel pins released by Overpowered in 2018.\n\nNeopets, Inc. signed various licensing deals with companies such as Viacom Consumer Products, Thinkway Toys, and Jakks Pacific over the years. Wizards of the Coast released the \"Neopets Trading Card Game\" in September 2003, which was promoted in three of General Mills \"Big G\" cereals and ten Simon Property Group malls. It received two different nominations for \"Toy of the Year\" as well as other recognitions. \"Neopets: The Official Magazine\" was a bi-monthly magazine released the same month but it was replaced in 2008 by \"Beckett Plushie Pals\", which featured \"Neopets\" news as well as other companies' products such as Webkinz.\n\nIn 2005, \"Neopets\" expanded to film and video game deals. The first movie was to be written by Ron Lieber and produced by Dylan Sellers and John A. Davis, but the project has since been cancelled with no other projects announced. Two video games were released by Sony Computer Entertainment, \"\" for the PlayStation 2 in 2005 and \"\" for the PlayStation Portable in 2006. 2006 also saw the release of \"Neopets\" mobile, which allowed users to visit the new land of Lutari Island, but it was discontinued on June 30, 2009, leaving the island completely inaccessible. \"Neopets\" wouldn't attempt another mobile game until 2015, when they released a match-3 game called \"Ghoul Catchers\" for Android and iOS. However, they still released other games during those years, including \"Treasure Keepers\" for Facebook and \"Puzzle Adventure\" for Nintendo DS, Wii, and PC.\n\n\n"}

A Nuit Blanche will typically have museums, private and public art galleries, and other cultural institutions open and free of charge, with the centre of the city itself being turned into a \"de facto\" art gallery, providing space for art installations, performances (music, film, dance, performance art), themed social gatherings, and other activities.\n\nIn 1989, the Helsinki Festival established its Night of the Arts, \"when every gallery, museum and bookshop is open until midnight or later and the whole city becomes one giant performance and carnival venue\". A year later, the mayor of Nantes, Jean-Marc Ayrault's program included renovating the central city and establishing a \"contemporary patrimony\", which led arts programmer Jean Blaise to create a late-night cultural festival, \"Les Allumées\" (\"Things Alight\"). His concept was to have an arts festival in Nantes, from 6 pm to 6 am, over six years with artists from six cities.\n\nThey were as follows:\n\nIn 1993, a year and a half after the St. Petersburg edition of Les Allumées, the annual White Nights Festival in that city began adding a specifically cultural component to a longstanding annual event that included street carnivals and the Scarlet Sails celebration. The expanded White Nights Festival has included pop culture (e.g. the Rolling Stones in the open air at Palace Square) in 2007 and high culture events (\"Stars of the White Nights Festival\" at the Mariinsky Theatre under Valery Gergiev) every year since 1993.\n\nIn 1997, the Long Night of Museums, took place in the newly re-united Berlin with a dozen participating schools and exhibitions; the number has risen to 125, with over 150,000 people taking part in the January 2005 night.\n\nIn 2001, when Bertrand Delanoë became Mayor of Paris, his deputy, Christophe Girard, invited Blaise to create an event there, and the Nuit Blanche was born. The concept of Les Allumées was scaled down to a single night and focused on the offerings of Paris. \"The first night-time trail through the streets of Paris and its contemporary-art scene took place on 5 October 2002, and the opportunity for anyone to explore artistic creation for a night has come back every year since.\"\n\nThe idea of a night-time festival of the arts has spread around the world, with events in over 120 cities, including Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Halifax, Winnipeg and Saskatoon in Canada, and several European capitals (Paris, Brussels, Rome, Madrid, Riga, Bucharest and Valletta) which have chosen to pool their efforts as \"Nuits Blanches Europe\". The cities share their experiences and exchange projects and artists. Each year, new cities become candidates.\n\nIn 2013, Melbourne hosted Australia's first White Night event with the city's galleries, theatres, music venues, laneways, shops and major cultural institutions all showcasing the city's art and culture, food and wine, fashion and sport. This first Melbourne White Night saw an estimated 300,000 people attend, exceeding initial estimates and constituting the largest event of its kind in Australia.\n\nContinuing with its international success, Nuit Blanche was announced to be held in Santiago Chile during 2015, making this important South American capital part of the Nuit Blanche international community. In the capital of Colombia, Bogota, the \"Noche en Blanco\" was made between 2013 and 2015.\n"}

It is awarded by the People's Prize Awarding Commission, which is working directly under the Cabinet of North Korea. The prize can be granted to works of art or people. People's Prize has been an important award in the field of North Korean cinema.\n\nThe works and people that have received the People's Prize cover such varied fields as literature, gymnastics, Korean revolutionary opera, acupuncture and sculpture. The People's Prize has been received by people abroad.\n\nThe People's Prize was instituted on 8 September 1958.\n\nThe first North Korean feature film \"My Hometown\" (1949) was directed by Kang Hongshik. It was the first of a film series to be awarded People's Prize. Kim Il-sung praised many of People's Prize winning movies from 1960s and 1970s of supplying an exhaustive answer to the issue of people's \"\". The Workers' Party gives the award to those North Korean films and film-makers seen as fulfilling the role of an \"excellent textbook\" for the workers party.\n\nSome of the works, which did not become recognized as \"Immortal classics\", did earn People's Prize meant only for the best productions. One such production is a three-part film \"Five Guerilla Brothers\" (1968) directed by Choe Ik-gyu, and overseen by Kim Jong-il himself. Other films overseen by Kim to win the People's Prize were \"A Flowering Village\" and \"A Family of Workers\" (1971). In the case of the \"A Family of Workers\", Kim Jong-il was reportedly not satisfied with the application of the seed theory. However, some of Kim Jong-il's movies, such as \"Sea of Blood\" (1968) and \"Flower girl\" (1972), became \"Immortal classics\".\n\nIn 1965 the Chongryon established Chosun University's teaching staff in Japan received the prize.\n\nMany of the works to obtain People's Prize are still highly regarded in North Korea. \"Reminiscences of the Anti-Japanese Guerillas\" is regarded as classic of literature of the Workers' Party, and was awarded People's Prize in 2012. It is still used in daily ideological study sessions at workplaces, and many of the memoirs have later been made into movies.\n\nPeople's Prize winner Kim Song-gun's major work \"Waves of the Sea Kumgang\" was used as a background for a group photo with Kim Jong-il and Bill Clinton during Clinton's visit to North Korea in 2009. Kim Song-gun received the award for his painting \"Waves of the Sea Kumgang\" in 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53684257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53684257", "title": "Place (Reddit)", "text": "Place (Reddit)\n\nPlace was a collaborative project and social experiment hosted on the social networking site Reddit that began on April Fools' Day 2017. The experiment involved an online canvas of one million (1000x1000) pixel squares, located at a subreddit called /r/place, which registered users could edit by changing the color of a single pixel from a 16-colour palette. After each pixel was placed, a timer prevented the user from placing any pixels for a period of time varying from 5 to 20 minutes.\n\nThe experiment was ended by Reddit administrators around 72 hours after its creation, on 3 April 2017. Over 1 million unique users edited the canvas, placing a total of approximately 16 million tiles, and, at the time the experiment was ended, had over 90,000 users viewing or editing it. The Place subreddit was archived on 19 April 2017.\n\nThe experiment was based in a subreddit, called /r/place, in which the user would be greeted by a screen displaying a section of the canvas with posts showing below. Registered users could place a pixel (or \"tile\") on an empty canvas, but had to wait before placing another. The waiting time varied from 5 to 20 minutes throughout the experiment. The choice of color for a user's pixel was between white, light gray, gray, black, pink, red, orange, brown, yellow, light green, green, aqua-blue, green-blue, blue, violet and purple.\n\nThe early hours of the canvas were characterized by random pixel placement and chaotic attempts at image creation. Among the first distinct sections of the canvas to emerge were a corner of entirely blue pixels (named \"Blue Corner\") and an homage to Pokémon. As the canvas developed, some established subreddit communities, such as those for video games, sports teams and individual countries, coordinated user efforts to claim and decorate particular sections. Other sections of the canvas were developed by specially created communities and coordination efforts, such as reproductions of the \"Mona Lisa\" and \"The Starry Night\".\n\nSeveral works of pixel art were created as a result of the experiment, varying from fictional characters and internet memes to patriotic flags and recreations of famous pieces of artwork. Several \"cults\" were also formed, usually associated with emblematic features such as a black void, green lattice, and a multi-colored \"rainbow road\".\n\nThe idea of \"place\" was commended for its unique take on representing the Reddit online community. The A.V. Club called it \"a benign, colorful way for Redditors to do what they do best: argue among each other about the things that they love\". ValueWalk.com described it as a \"microcosm of the emergent, spontaneous order that characterize society\", with Gizmodo labelling it as a \"testament to the internet's ability to collaborate\". A number of commentators described Place as a representation of internet culture. Some also commented on the apparent relationship between the makeup of the final canvas and the individual communities within Reddit, which exist independently but cooperate as part of a larger community. Newsweek called it \"the internet's best experiment yet\". One writer at Ars Technica suggested that the cooperative spirit of Place represented a model for fighting extremism in internet communities. The experiment did receive some criticism for the lack of protection from bot usage and the automated placing of pixels. After ending, many clones of /r/place sparked, such as pxls.space, PixelCanvas.io, pixelzone.io, and canvas.place.\n\n"}

The theatre which Lehmann calls postdramatic is not primarily focused on the drama in itself, but evolves a performative aesthetic in which the text of the performance is put in a special relation to the material situation of the performance and the stage. The post dramatic theatre attempts to mimic the unassembled and unorganized literature that a playwright sketches in the novel\n\nThus postdramatic theatre is more striving to produce an effect amongst the spectators than to remain true to the text. Lehmann locates what he calls 'the new theatre' as part of 'a simultaneous and multi-perspectival form of perceiving'; this, he argues is brought about, in large part, by a reaction to the dominance of the written text.\n\nThe new theatre, Lehmann asserts, is characterised by, amongst other things, the 'use and combination of heterogeneous styles', it situates itself as after or beyond dialogue and incorporates the notion of the 'performer as theme and protagonist'.\n\nIn its most radical varieties, postdramatic theatre knows no \"plot\" at all, but concentrates fully on the interaction between performer and audience.\n\nAnother way of using the notion is to describe plays with little or no drama, for instance the plays of Jon Fosse.\n\nSome names associated with postdramatic theatre are Tadeusz Kantor (Krakow), Heiner Müller (Berlin), Robert Wilson (New York City), The Wooster Group (New York City), The Builders Association (New York City), Richard Foreman (New York City), Big Art Group (New York City), Jan Fabre, Jan Lauwers and Needcompany, Frank Castorf (Berlin), Josef Szeiler/TheaterAngelusNovus (Vienna), Elfriede Jelinek (Vienna), Heiner Goebbels (Frankfurt), Verdensteatret (Oslo), Alvis Hermanis (Riga), Forced Entertainment (Sheffield), Teater Moment (Stockholm), the Apocryphal Theatre (London), The Sydney Front (Australia) and Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio (Italy), Navid Memar Kermani (Amta Theater Group-Iran).\n\nA new wave of post-dramatic performance companies are troubling the work of those past. These companies include the likes of Pan Pan (Ireland), POST (Australia), Action Hero (United Kingdom), Nature Theatre of Oklahoma (United States), and more.\n\nA new generation of internationally working postdramatic directors is changing the big picture: Among them are Thomas Luz, Amir Reza Koohestani, Susanne Kennedy, Dusan David Parizek, Yael Ronen, Simon Stone, Kai Tuchmann, Anna Bergmann,Bastian Kraft,Ulrich Rasche, Niklas Stemann, and Kay Voges.\n\n\n"}

The older brother was an ox called Preah Ko and the younger one was a man named Preah Keo. Preah Ko was an ox who possessed divine power. His belly contained precious objects and valuable things that people wanted very much. Both sacred brothers were believed to bring peace and prosperity to the place where they resided.\n\nThe \"Legend of Preah Ko Preah Keo\" is very popular in Cambodian society. The story has existed in several versions including oral, written, film and paintings. The Khmer people have great respect for the enchanting brothers. In some shrines throughout the country, Khmers have placed statues of \"Preah Ko\" and \"Preah Keo\", who keep watch over the land they left but never abandoned.\n\nThe Khmers and the Siamese (Khmer: \"Siem\") throughout their history had many wars with each other. The Siamese had sacked the Khmer’s capital of Angkor. Later on, Longvek, another of Cambodia’s capitals in the 16th century. After their successful capture of Angkor and Longvek, the Siamese brought many precious objects, jewels, statues, texts, learned men and many prisoners of war from Cambodia to their capital of Ayutthaya. The loss of these materials and human resources had a tremendous effect on the kingdom. The country had declined and lacked signs of progress in the later periods.\n\nTo explain these historical events and to express the great sadness over the loss of these priceless resources, the Khmers composed a legend called the \"Legend of Preah Ko Preah Keo\".\n\n"}
{"id": "12667206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12667206", "title": "Project Superpowers", "text": "Project Superpowers\n\nProject Superpowers is a comic book limited series published by Dynamite Entertainment beginning January 2008. It was co-plotted by Jim Krueger and Alex Ross, with scripts by Jim Krueger, covers by Alex Ross, and interior art by Doug Klauba and Stephen Sadowski for issue #0, and Carlos Paul for the remainder of the series. Ross is also art director, which includes sketched pages, color guides, and redesigns of most of the characters.\n\nThe series resurrects a number of Golden Age superheroes originally published by companies including Fox Comics, Crestwood Publications, and Nedor Comics, many of whom are in the public domain, including the protagonist, Fighting Yank.\n\nThe story is set in a present-day world that is different from our own; it is implied that the absence of the world's heroes allowed the United States to become a virtual dictatorship, with the Dynamic Forces corporation manipulating world events for the sake of order and profit. The Police Corps consists of armored officers who show no mercy, wars are being waged for nothing more than business reasons, and even free speech is heavily restricted. In addition to all this, a terrorist movement called \"The Claw\" (which may or may not be related to the Golden Age villain of the same name) is active around the world. It is into this setting that the released heroes first emerge.\n\nBruce Carter III, formerly the World War II-era hero Fighting Yank, is now an elderly man. As he sits quietly in his home, thinking and wrestling with his regrets, he's confronted by an apparition. Carter mistakes the ghost for that of his colonial-era ancestor, a spirit which guided and advised him throughout his WWII adventures. The ghost, shrouded in an American flag, is instead an amalgamation of the spirits of patriots, heroes, and martyrs who fought and died for their country. The apparition has come to accuse Carter of betrayal and warn him of his impending death. Carter flees from The American Spirit (for that is the name of this Dickensian apparition).\nThrough a series of flashback sequences, we learn Fighting Yank's WWII backstory. In a meeting between an unidentified general, Fighting Yank, Green Lama, Black Terror, The Flame, and “Big Blue” (1), it is revealed that Adolf Hitler has come into possession of a mystical object which is the original source of all the world's evil: Pandora's Box (actually an urn) described in the ancient Greek myth. Bruce Carter in his guise as The Fighting Yank, is tasked by the U.S. Government to parachute into Nazi Germany and steal the urn.\nPandora's urn introduced evil into the world, but also released hope; while the Axis powers are the representatives of that evil, the 1940s “mystery men” are conversely the embodiment of hope. The mystical creatures released when the urn was opened are visible as physical entities when special goggles (invented by Alan Oppenheimer and other atomic scientists) are worn. Yank puts on the goggles and is immediately attacked by the creatures. After he removes the goggles, Yank's “spirit guide” (the ghost of his colonial-era ancestor, Bruce Carter I) tells him that since hope was the last thing released from the urn the only way to reimprison its evil is to first trap his fellow mystery men within it.\n\nFighting Yank attempts to convince his allies to enter the urn voluntarily, but they refuse. Carter determines to imprison them one at a time. Three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, the mystery men are in Kokura, Japan, the intended target of the second atomic bomb. Their purpose is to stop the bombing by obtaining a Japanese surrender. Instead of surrendering, the Japanese army attacks the heroes, resulting in a large-scale battle. The U.S. military, in the mistaken belief that the resulting dust and debris are cloud cover obscuring the city, switch the target city to Nagasaki. Meanwhile, Carter takes advantage of the confusion to trap The Flame within the urn; it was necessary to imprison The Flame first as his power would help the other mystery men survive within the urn.\n\nThe Flame is presumed killed, ironically, by the fires of Kokura. The Fighting Yank imprisons Flame Girl after The Flame's memorial service. In the years following World War II, Carter continues to imprison his fellow mystery men, one by one, including the newer heroes which spring up after the war. One of the few heroes to escape this fate is The Green Lama, who returned to Tibet immediately after The Flame's memorial.\n\nNow, in Carter's twilight years, The American Spirit has come to indict Carter for this betrayal. Carter's ancestor arrives to argue with The American Spirit, to convince Carter that he did indeed do the right thing. The patriotic apparition counters with a catalogue of the world's ills which have occurred since the mystery men were imprisoned in the urn: the rise of Dynamic Forces, a mega-corporation that plays on the world's greed and sloth by offering material creature comforts to the masses; a fascist police forces that cows the population and keeps them in line; a zombie army made from the decomposing bodies of America's dead military men, sent to the Middle East to fight on the government's behalf, forced to battle and be reconstructed over and over endlessly, while the soldiers' souls languish in limbo. “How can you say you've done anything to stop or contain evil?...All you've done...is to stop those who might have helped keep this from happening,” The American Spirit argues.\n\nCarter makes his decision. He asks The American Spirit what he must do to make amends. The answer lies in Tibet; despite his advanced age, Carter must journey there and seek counsel from The Green Lama, even though Carter suspects that Green Lama will kill him for what he's done.\n\nIn New York City, atop the Dynamic Forces skyscraper headquarters, Dynamic Man and Dynamic Woman look down upon the city. Godlike, they regard humanity as little more than the ants they appear to be from atop their glass and steel eyrie.\nAs Bruce Carter, the former Fighting Yank, struggles through the snows of Tibet, he is beginning to realize that he has been badly misled by the ghost of his ancestor and namesake, that his ancestor might well be a traitor with his own hidden agenda. Reaching Shangri-La, Carter is greeted by Tsarong, Green Lama's manservant, who takes him to his master. Jethro “Jet” Dumont, the Green Lama, who has apparently not aged since the 1940s, greets Carter warmly. Carter confesses to Lama that he's trapped all of their former allies inside Pandora's Urn, and is surprised by Lama's nonchalance at the revelation.\n\nLama explains to Carter and The American Spirit that he's discovered the power of the “meta-natural” world. It has provided him with new abilities, one of which he immediately demonstrates. Leafy vines suddenly spring up from the ground and engulf the trio; when the vines peel away, they find themselves in New York City. The American Spirit tells Carter that Pandora's Urn will be found in the possession of Dynamic Man, a former ally who, like the Green Lama, wasn't “chosen” to be trapped in the urn.\n\nAt Dynamic Forces headquarters, Carter and Green Lama are ushered into the presence of the Dynamic Family who, like Jet Dumont, have also not aged. Dynamic Man is the caretaker of numerous artifacts, mystical and otherwise, left over from the dark days of World War II. Lama asks if Carter may see the urn. Dynamic Man makes to hand the urn to Carter but deliberately drops it instead. With surprising agility for one so elderly, Carter makes a diving catch. Carter himself breaks the urn open and is surprised when nothing happens. Dynamic Man laughs as he informs the duo that he'd had the urn exorcised, while Dynamic Woman hints that the Family may be something more/other than human. Then the Family members grab Carter and Green Lama and throw them down an elevator shaft, despite the fact that the Lama can fly. The elevator car, its cables cut, hurtles down at them; Lama smashes through it and the heroes exit onto the rooftop. Carter puts on his power cloak and mask to again become The Fighting Yank.\n\nThe Dynamic Family attacks the heroes on the rooftop, while hundreds of Dynamic Forces employees rush into the fray. Suddenly another mystery man bursts through the rooftop and comes to the aid of Yank and Lama. He is The Black Terror, who has determined that no one but he should have the privilege of killing The Fighting Yank as revenge for Terror's decades-long imprisonment in the urn. During the fight, Black Terror accidentally punches Dynamic Man too hard and discovers, to everyone's surprise, that Dynamic Man is actually a robot. The robot replies by hurling Black Terror from the rooftop. Cat-like, Black Terror lands on his feet on the sidewalk below, cratering it in the process. The Terror then shakes his fist at the rooftop and howls in rage, “OK, Bruce, Fighting Yank gets a reprieve – I'm not going to kill you until after I kill Dynamic Man!”\n\nMystery men of the 1940s, released from Pandora's Urn, are popping up all over the globe. A red-and-blue clad, boomerang wielding figure emerges from the fabled sewers of Paris in time to see a street riot in progress...\n\nMeanwhile, in New York City, the Fighting Yank and the Green Lama fight for their lives against the robotic Dynamic Family and their mechanical hordes. The Black Terror claws his way back up the side of the skyscraper and rejoins the fray, but seems just as concerned with the fate of his kid sidekick Tim (Kid Terror) as he does with the struggle at hand. Now that they know their opponents are robots instead of flesh and blood, the heroes battle with furious abandon. With a massive rumbling, huge trees and vines suddenly sprout from the heart of the Dynamic Forces headquarters; the Green Lama is using his meta-natural abilities to transport himself and his allies away from the lopsided fight.\n\nIn Paris, the mysterious stranger saves a law enforcement officer from the rioters, taking down a few members of the mob in the process. After their escape it's revealed that the officer is a woman who identifies the mob as a group of terrorists and herself as Justine. The stranger remains ever silent.\n\nBack in Shangri-La after their escape from the Dynamic Family, the heroes discuss what they've experienced. The American Spirit is of the belief that the urn's destruction has released the imprisoned mystery men who are likely to reappear randomly around the globe. The Black Terror continues to threaten Fighting Yank's life, while the ghostly Bruce Carter I continues to try to sway his descendant away from The American Spirit.\n\nWar is being waged in the Middle East. The United States has replaced its traditional human soldiers with the F-Troop: the reanimated corpses of soldiers killed in previous wars. The war's goal is to destroy the world's petroleum source, which will prompt industrialized nations to switch to a new synthetic fuel created and monopolized by Dynamic Forces. Not coincidentally, Dynamic Forces also controls the U.S. military and is fighting the war with the undead F-Troop soldiers which are also Dynamic's patented creation. Acting as a pair of thorns in Dynamic's side are the heroes Samson (possessed of superhuman strength and the ability to repel ballistic missiles) and The Scarab (clad in powered stealth armor), who meet and join forces to battle the F-Troop.\n\nThe Flame appears in Hollywood, California; disoriented and frantic to find Flame Girl (Linda), he accidentally sets the famous “Hollywood” sign on fire with his flame pistol. In Shangri-La, Black Terror, also frantic to find his old sidekick, argues with The American Spirit and decks Fighting Yank. In New York, the Dynamic Family is unable to destroy the meta-natural greenery that has overrun their skyscraper; they've called on The Crusaders to deal with the returned heroes...\n\nShangri-La is under attack. The Crusaders, a U.S. military strike force (under the control of the Dynamic Family) is flying in ‘’en masse’’ to destroy buildings, kill citizens, and essentially level the city. Led to the scene by Dynamic Forces micro-transmitters which were secretly placed on Black Terror’s uniform, the Crusaders wreak havoc as the vastly outnumbered heroes (Green Lama, Black Terror, and Fighting Yank) struggle to stop them.\n\nIn a Middle Eastern bazaar, Samson tells Scarab the tale of how he lost his eyes. Samson was among the heroes who’d gone on a peace mission to Kokura, Japan, a mission gone horribly wrong. Kokura had been slated as the target of the second atomic bomb in 1945, so the costumed mystery men travelled there to convince the Japanese to surrender before the bomb could be dropped. The mission instead became a battle which created so much smoke and dust that the U.S. military switched the bomb’s target to Nagasaki instead. Samson flew off from Kokura to intercept the bombing mission. Arriving too late to prevent the bomb’s deployment, Samson is caught in the air burst and the blast literally melts his eyes.\n\nIn Paris, the mute mystery man uses a pad and pencil to introduce himself to his new ally Justine, a French law enforcement anti-terrorism operative. On the pad, he writes the word “Devil”.\n\nMore heroes released from the urn are popping up around the globe. In California, The Flame runs to the seashore, leaving a path of burning devastation in his wake. Placing his flame pistol to his head, he's about to commit suicide when a sudden tidal wave hits the beach and stops him. The wave is caused by his old friend Hydro who has also recently been released from the urn.\n\nThe scene shifts to Asia, where a disoriented, amnesiac Masquerade wanders the streets of a town in which the residents have been afflicted by a mysterious plague. There she encounters her former ally and lover V-Man, who is apparently the plagues's unwitting source; just after they meet, Masquerade fces breaks out in angry red boils.\n\nMr. Face and a nameless companion sit drinking in a Mexican cantina. In the 1940s, Mr. Face was just an unpowered adventurer in a fright mask, but his time in the urn has transformed him (as it did many of his fellow mystery men): now his mask causes others to experience their worst fears. As the village's inhabitants run screaming through the streets outside, Mr. Face and his drinking buddy confess their own worst fears. The nameless companion fears falling “off the wagon” back into alcoholism. Mr. Face's fear has already come true: he can’t remove the mask.\n\nIn Shangri-La, the fight is going badly for the heroes. The city is dying; snow falls in Shangri-La for the first time in thousands of years. Green Lama's friend and manservant Tsarong is fried by a Crusader ray blast, while another Crusader burns a gaping hole in Fighting Yank's chest (which matches the hole Black Terror punched in the chest of Dynamic Man). Yank's power cloak keeps him alive, but he's left behind as Green Lama uses one of his meta-natural “leaf piles” to transport the heroes back to New York. After the departure Fighting Yank falls face first into the snow as The American Spirit flutters down and covers him like a star-spangled shroud.\n\nDynamic Forces’ headquarters (and all of New York City) has been overrun by Green Lama's meta-natural foliage. The Dynamic Family abandons New York and relocates to Philadelphia. While there, they see the television coverage of the destruction inadvertently caused by The Flame and Hydro. The recently released heroes are bombarded by media questions (including “Are you a couple?” It would seem that many things have changed over the sixty years of their imprisonment within Pandora's Urn). Dynamic Man decides to change his strategy for combating the heroes; he will call out the nationwide Police Corp, a fascistic cadre of stormtroopers, and use them to manipulate the media, making martyrs of the Dynamic Family.\n\nShangri-La has been destroyed. The Crusaders carry the Fighting Yank through the snow, while Yank's spirit guide realizes that he's lost and truly damned.\n\nGreen Lama has renamed New York City “New Shangri-La”. His meta-natural greenery has taken over the city; huge vines and foliage wrap around the skyscrapers. Unable to remove the Dynamic Family's micro-transmitters from the Black Terror, Green Lama decides to send Black Terror across the globe to gather up the newly released superheroes as they appear and bring them back to New Shangri-La.\n\nIn the Middle East, Scarab shows Samson a “Black Cross” facility, where the undead F-Troop soldiers are reconstituted and sent back into battle. The political goal of using these zombie troops is to make war “acceptable” to the masses; Samson recognizes that the soldiers’ souls are thereby trapped and that the F-Troop is an abomination. He charges through the tents and begins the work of destroying the undead soldiers, releasing their souls.\n\nIn Tibet, the dying Fighting Yank begins to understand how he was misled by his ancestor; it was never about “doing the right thing” but was instead about releasing Bruce Carter I's soul from the curse it labored under. Inspired by The American Spirit, who reassures Yank that his misguided betrayal of his allies has not damned him, Fighting Yank challenges his Crusader captors to “do their worst”.\n\nEvents are moving too quickly even for the Dynamic Family. Communications have been cut with their Tibetan Crusader squadron, a Middle Eastern F-Troop unit has been totally destroyed (even beyond the ability to reanimate the corpses), and Black Terror's location is constantly changing as Green Lama sends him around the globe to gather together the reemerging heroes. “How could one old man have started this?” muses Dynamic Woman.\n\nIn Paris, the Death Defying 'Devil and Justine's \"ad hoc\" alliance is strengthened as ‘Devil learns of a terrorist organization called The Claw, and realizes there might be a connection with his old archenemy of the same name. Just then the Black Terror (accompanied by Masquerade and V-Man) arrives to gather up 'Devil.\n\nBack in California, The Flame and Hydro have given themselves up to the Police Corp, unaware of the organization's stormtrooper tactics. As the Police Corp begin to savagely beat the handcuffed heroes, Pyroman arrives to lend the heroes a hand. It’s going badly for the Corp when Dynamic Boy suddenly appears and lends the Corp a hand...\n\nAfter wiping out his Crusader captors, the Fighting Yank continues to argue with his ancestor’s spirit; Yank has come to realize that his ancestor advised him to commit a hideous wrong for purely selfish reasons. The ghost says he’s in Hell; Yank merely replies, “Good”.\n\nDynamic Boy ambushes The Flame and Hydro. Pyroman arrives and electrocutes Dynamic Boy, apparently killing him (of course, the reader knows that Dynamic Boy is a robot). Just as the Police Corp prepare to attack the heroes, Black Terror appears in a riot of meta-natural greenery to whisk the trio away to New Shangri-La where they are greeted by the Green Lama (who believes Fighting Yank to be dead).\n\nV-Man, unable to control his new “plague” power, is under quarantine in a plexiglass room. While there, Masquerade comes to visit him; it seems that removing her mask somehow cured her of the plague.\n\nThe Dynamic Family makes a televised media circus of Dynamic Boy's funeral. Dynamic Man accuses the superheroes of being “terrorists”, while Dynamic Woman calls for the nations of the planet to unite for a war against the “Superpowers”.\n\nThe Target, another released hero, makes an appearance. The Police Corp attempt to take him down, but his ability to split into three separate beings confuses the fascist troops.\n\nIn the Middle East, Black Terror joins with Samson and the Scarab in a brutal battle against F-Troop zombies. Black Terror indicates that the other Superpowers will likely join later in an effort to destroy the F-Troop abomination.\n\nBack in Tibet, the Fighting Yank is slipping fast; only his power cloak is keeping him (barely) alive. Suddenly three arrows slam into the gaping wound in Yank's chest, fired by the Arrow, another hero released from the urn.\n\nIn December 2008, Dynamite partnered with \"Wizard Magazine\" to produce a special #½ issue. The story takes place at Dynamic Boy's funeral (between issues #5 and #6 of the first series) and sees Dynamic Man reflecting on the past. We see Dynamic Man and Dynamic Boy in WWII Germany admiring what Hitler has accomplished before playing the role of heroes when their super-powered allies arrive. Back in the present, we see Dynamic Boy emerge from his grave and the next part of the Dynamic Family's plan is revealed.\n\nA flashback sequence shows Bruce Carter I during the American Revolution promising that he'd “be damned” if he failed to deliver a vital message. Stopping for a drink on his journey, Carter is ambushed and killed in the tavern by British soldiers who subsequently find the message he is carrying; Carter is indeed damned as a result. As it later transpires, Carter I's guidance of his descendant and namesake, the Golden Age hero known as The Fighting Yank, is some sort of atonement for his misdeed, but it seems that he's no more competent in death than he was in life. The Arrow's three shots appear to have been accidental, but also seem to be finishing off Yank.\n\nIn New Shangri-La, Masquerade visits the quarantined V-Man and informs him that her “possession” power will also allow her to recover from the plague he carries; she can freely enter his “bubble”, but V-Man is so consumed with self-pity that he rejects her. More importantly, she informs V-Man that Green Lama intends to use him as a “secret weapon” should the need arise. Lama arrives to round up Masquerade, as the Superpowers are bound for the Middle East to help Samson and Scarab in their battle against the F-Troop.\n\nScarab, meanwhile, reveals his identity to Samson and tells of how he once sold a scarab-shaped stone he found, used the money to establish a financial empire, and then built the powered armor he now wears.\n\nDynamic Man appears before the shadowy cabal known as The Supremacy, petitioning them for full membership. Dynamic Forces has been working for The Supremacy, following their orders, but Dynamic Man believes the time has come for him to become a member instead of a pawn. The Supremacy rejects his request, but not before informing him that more F-Troop forces are being dispatched to the Middle East. The ground there is also being sewn with a defoliating treatment that will prevent Green Lama's transportation powers from working; if the Superpowers appear there, they will be trapped.\n\nThe Superpowers prepare to leave for the Middle East, but Green Lama first tells the team what they are about to do and what to expect. The world's governments have become corrupt, and the Superpowers will need to operate without them, outside the law if need be. The team will be likely be vilified by governments, in the press, and by the public. \"We will become targets from this day forward, the outrage of the unknowing representatives of hidden corruption. Perhaps this is at the root of what it means to be a hero.\" They vanish, reappearing in the Middle East in time to aid Scarab and Samson in their fight against (and efforts to save the souls of) the F-Troop forces there.\n\nMeanwhile, American Spirit tells the dying Fighting Yank that his friends will die unless he saves them—by taking his ancestor's curse and damnation upon himself.\n\nThe Superpowers' battle is going badly. Heavily outnumbered by F-Troop forces (with more being airdropped), the team decides a retreat is in order. But Green Lama has collapsed; when he rises, he appears to have aged a half-century or more...\n\nThe finale for this chapter. The battle between the Superpowers and F-Troop rages on. As more and more undead soldiers parachute down from the sky, the rapidly aging Green Lama tells Black Terror that \"all of them\"(the F-Troop) must arrive before Lama will spring a trap on them.\n\nFighting Yank chooses to accept his ancestor's curse in order to help his endangered teammates. His sole request of the American Spirit is that he would be able to keep his magical cloak so that he would be able to affect the world with more than just his words, a request which was granted. Wrapped in his cloak, the Fighting Yank dies.\n\nAs the members of The Supremacy watch remotely, the Superpowers continue to fight for their lives. On the verge of springing their \"trap\" (a mysterious figure covered in leaves), they suddenly discover that Green Lama is unable to transport them away. In desperation, Lama flies Masquerade up to one of the planes airdropping the F-Troop, where Masquerade uses her \"possession\" power on the pilot. She learns that The Supremacy has treated the ground with a chemical that neutralizes Lama's meta-natural powers and that they've been lured into a trap. Lama urges the heroes with flight powers to escape, but his teammates refuse to go. As the Superpowers prepare for death (and glory), Fighting Yank (or his spirit) appears; his cloak strengthens Green Lama who is then able to use his meta-natural abilities to transport the team to safety.\n\nThe mysterious leafed figure stays behind. Bursting forth from the greenery that protected the other Superpowers from his plague powers, V-Man springs Lama's \"trap\", walking impervious among the undead F-Troop soldiers and sending them to the final reward that they've previously been denied by Dynamic Forces' blasphemous reanimation technology.\n\nWith Green Lama as their spokesman, the Superpowers appear on television to address the public. \"The nations of this world have grown corrupt with their own power...It is with this in mind that we shall become a check to balance the corruption of the nations of the world. You may call us terrorists, but we're not. We are Americans. And we are your friends.\"\n\nThe members of The Supremacy watch the broadcast and realize that the Superpowers have just declared war. Unknown to the heroes, one of their number is a Supremacy member: Amon Khadul, The Scarab.\n\nFighting Yank and Black Terror patch their differences as more heroes, responding to the worldwide broadcast, begin to arrive in New Shangri-La. The first on the scene is The Owl...\n\nOn May 3, 2008, there was a Free Comic Book Day special edition of \"Project Superpowers\" released. In the story, which takes place after issue #7 of the first series, the heroes wonder if the Claw is still alive and reflect on ’Devil’s history with him.\n\nReleased in October 2008 as a teaser to \"Project Superpowers: Chapter Two\", this one-shot showcases a number of drawings of heroes and groups who will presumably be featured in the next chapter. The groups are: \"The Inheritors\", led by the Boy King and his Giant, and composed of many of the young sidekicks of the heroes, including the Black Terror's sidekick, Tim; \"The Patriots\", a team of flag-wearing heroes who return to the service of the American government, and are mentioned to come into conflict with the Black Terror; \"The Supremacy\", a secret cabal who were introduced previously, who include a \"President West\", and numerous villain characters, plus the Scarab's secret identity; \"The Scarlet Sisters\", a team-up between Masquerade, the Woman in Red, and Lady Satan; \"The Big Shots\", a trio composed of Mr. Face, Skyman, and Marvelo, all of whose abilities are hinted to be dangerous and difficult to control; \"The Super-Mysterymen\", a group of heroes who are said to have been tracked and captured immediately after the destruction of the urn to be used for an unknown party's purposes. Furthermore, several single heroes were shown, including: Captain Future, Cat-Man (now a partially feline character, called Man-Cat), Burning Eagle (who is constantly aflame), Black Owl (whose body now contains a black hole), Silver Streak, the Ghost, and a newly created hero pair, Truth and Dare, who are said to be inspired by the return of the Superpowers. \"Chapter Two Prelude\" also contains small previews of the \"Black Terror\", \"Death Defying 'Devil\", and \"Masquerade\" mini-series.\n\nFollowing the events of Project Superpowers and Black Terror, the members of The Supremacy decide to launch a nuclear assault on New Shangri-La; The Scarab, who is secretly a member of The Supremacy, informs The Superpowers of this, and they invade The Pentagon and abduct U.S. President Gene West (who is a former superhero called Power Nelson) before the attack begins. The Green Lama travels to the Supremacy's headquarters and warns them to leave America alone.\n\nThe Inheritors, disturbed by what they see as their adult partners running amok, decide to gather other heroes who've escaped from the Urn of Pandora in order to oppose the Superpowers. They find Cat-Man, who now acts like a feral beast, and The Eagle, who is now constantly burning from within.\n\nLater, Captain Future—who is now possessed by Zeus, who had originally created the Urn—appears in the Caribbean, leading people to engage in drunken orgies with him and attacking anyone who opposes him; two new heroes called Truth and Dare try to fight him, and fail. The Superpowers try to get Captain Future under control, and they also fail. It turns out the Captain is working with The Supremacy, who have The Flame's partner Flame Girl prisoner; he steals her flame powers, and prepares to wage war on the Superpowers.\n\nMeanwhile, Tim the Kid Terror is attacked by Cat-Man, who had broken out of his cage; the other Inheritors don't see that the gash in Tim's face reveals machinery. \"Tim\" is actually Dynamic Boy, who had killed Tim two months earlier in order to assume his identity.\n\nWere also edited in format TPB volume 1 from issues #1–6, and volume 2 issues #7–12 (See section \"Collected editions\").\n\nThe characters of \"Project Superpowers\" include:\n\nIssues #1–6 each include a two-page layout of Golden Age character sketches by Alex Ross and inLight Studio. Most of the layouts feature over a dozen characters each, some of whom now have altered names or nicknames to avoid trademark conflicts (e.g., \"Hydro-Man\" is now the name of a Spider-Man villain, so the original Hydroman is now called Hydro).\n\n\nThe collected edition includes all of the above sketches, plus the Masked Marvel, Sky Wizard, Brad Spencer (Wonderman), Martan the Marvel Man and Vana, Professor Supermind and Son, and Power Nelson (the Futureman).\n\n\"Project Superpowers: Chapter One\"\n\nIn December 2008, the first series was released as a hardcover collected edition (), in which a few minor corrections were made (i.e., the title to issue #5 was included, and Dynamic Man's name was correctly given as Bert McQuade instead of Curt Cowan). A trade paperback was released in May 2009 ().\n\n\"Project Superpowers: Chapter Two\"\n\nWas collected into two trade paperback volumes:\n\nThere are a number of spin-off limited series from this series including:\n\n\n\n"}

See Japanese Films copyright timeline.\n\nDue to the U.S. Copyright Term Extension Act, no more films will automatically enter public domain in the United States until January 1, 2019, when the copyright will expire on films released in 1923 (and in 2020 films from 1924, and so on).\n\nAll copyrightable works made by United States government employees as part of their official duties are in the public domain from their creation. The status of works made by contractors is dependent on the terms of their contract. Note that this applies only to the federal government, and not to state or local governments, which may or may not claim copyright depending on state laws\n\nAnother issue specifically affects copyright of foreign works in the United States. The Uruguay Round agreements on copyright led to the U.S. Congress re-imposing copyright on some items which had fallen into the public domain (in section 514 of the URAA Act), as of 1996.\n\nIn the course of changes made to both U.S. domestic law and international copyright agreements in the last two decades, some works which had fallen in the public domain had copyright restored in the U.S. This was challenged on the grounds that works once in the public domain could not revert to copyright protection - a constitutional question. The see-saw course of court decisions on the matter have caused confusion, with many significant works (such as \"The Third Man\") changing status several times in a short period.\n\nSpecifically, from a holding published on 3 April 2009 to a reversal on 21 June 2010, re-imposition of copyright was not permitted. That brief period came after the 2001 American case \"Golan v. Gonzales\" was reconsidered as \"Golan v. Holder\". Since the Supreme Court of the U.S. (SCOTUS) has granted certiorari, we may expect a definitive answer on point soon; meanwhile, re-imposition of copyright stands.\n\nInitially, Judge Babcock held that the First Amendment was not applicable to resurrecting foreign copyright claims. This holding followed tradition in that the First Amendment (which protects against suppression of free speech by government) has always been held not to prevail against the earlier copyright clause (copyrights are generally held by persons, not the U.S. government).\nSubsequently, Babcock reversed himself on advice by a higher court that such an act by an arm of government (Congress) changed the traditional interpretation of copyright and should be subject to First Amendment scrutiny. That reversal was itself reversed on appeal and summary judgement granted for the government.\nBabcock's holding - that \"In the United States, that body of law includes the bedrock principle that works in the public domain remain in the public domain. Removing works from the public domain violated Plaintiffs’ vested First Amendment interests\" - therefore no longer applies. Unless and until review is complete by SCOTUS, public domain works can have copyright re-imposed by international treaty and the First Amendment will not prevent it.\n\nNote that restored, subtitled, and dubbed versions of films can themselves be subject to copyright, even if other elements of the film are in the public domain. Thus even if a film dates from 1915 and as such is ineligible for copyright in the United States of America, a 2004 version with new visual or audio elements (including the addition of a new recording of the score of a silent film) may be itself eligible for a 2004 copyright to those new elements. Special features and packaging are themselves subject to copyright protection.\n\nThe question of whether restored films like the most recent version of \"Metropolis\" can be copyrighted will not be clear until after the SCOTUS review is complete. That is because the SCOTUS review examines both the First Amendment issue, affecting a version which existed in 1996, and also the much more fundamental question whether Congress has the right to remove works from the public domain at all. There is also a legal question in the U.S. whether a restored print, as a copy of a public domain work, is not original - so does not qualify for copyright protection.\n\n"}

{"id": "36705076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36705076", "title": "Radio in Austria", "text": "Radio in Austria\n\nThe first radio transmissions in Austria started in 1924 in Vienna. Programming started with classical music, daily news were not allowed to be broadcast to protect the newspaper producers. However, near the end of the 1920s, the political influence started to affect the medium radio as well. After 1933, Germany started transmitting propaganda directed at Austria, which was countered by the local radio stations. After Austria joined Germany in 1938, the Austrian radio stations became part of the German radio network.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the studio was located inside the Soviet occupation zone, so the programming had a small but noticeable Soviet influence. The other three occupation forces started their own programming as well, which competed with each other causing a huge variety of different radio stations for that time.\n\nAfter Austria became independent again in 1955, programming consisted of three national radio stations, transmitted via mediumwave and FM. Because the government refused to raise the radio fees, the third program had to be closed due to lack of money in 1962. Only in 1966, after a new law was enacted, could programming restart with three programs - Ö1, Ö2 and Ö3.\n\nSoon, the decision was made to abandon mediumwave, not just due to the lack of frequencies in Austria, but also because the alpine terrain proved to be difficult to cover by mediumwave. By 1976, only 80% of the population was covered by mediumwave at daytime, at night this number fell to 65%. Therefore, all medium wave stations were shut off, with the exception of the frequency 1476 kHz from Vienna (Sendeanlage Bisamberg) to cover Czechoslovakia. As well, a shortwave transmitter in Aldrans was used until the 80s to cover the deep Tyrolean valleys which couldn't be reached by mediumwave or FM.\n\nEspecially Ö3 was innovative with their pop music format, which was unusual in Europe in the 60s and 70s. It caused a huge popularity of the station, as well as the Austropop music genre. In 1979, Blue Danube Radio was launched to target the various United Nations personnel present in Austria.\n\nIn the 1980s, because commercial radio stations were still illegal, the first radio stations started to broadcast from foreign territory, especially South Tyrol and the former Socialist countries in the east. In 1993, the European Union condemned Austria for forbidding commercial radio stations and thus violating free speech rights. In July 1993, the monopoly of Österreichischer Rundfunk was softened, allowing the launch of the first commercial radio stations in 1995. It took until 1997 for the ban on commercial radio stations to be lifted completely, and in 1998 several new stations launched in Austria.\n\nLike in Germany, radio in Austria was completely separated by state, allowing radio stations to transmit in one state only. A law change 2001 allowed licenses for country-wide radio stations to be given out. So far, the only such license is owned by KroneHit.\n\n"}

{"id": "232445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232445", "title": "Self-fulfilling prophecy", "text": "Self-fulfilling prophecy\n\nA self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true, by the very terms of the prophecy itself, due to positive feedback between belief and behavior. Although examples of such prophecies can be found in literature as far back as ancient Greece and ancient India, it is 20th-century sociologist Robert K. Merton who is credited with coining the expression \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" and formalizing its structure and consequences. In his 1948 article \"Self-Fulfilling Prophecy\", Merton defines it in the following terms: \n\nSelf-fulfilling prophecy are effects in \"behavioral confirmation effect\", in which behavior, influenced by expectations, causes those expectations to come true. It is complementary to the self-defeating prophecy.\n\nMerton's concept of the \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" stems from the Thomas theorem, which states that \"If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences\". According to Thomas, people react not only to the situations they are in, but also, and often primarily, to the way they perceive the situations and to the meaning they assign to their perceptions. Therefore, their behaviour is determined in part by their perception and the meaning they ascribe to the situations they are in, rather than by the situations themselves. Once people convince themselves that a situation really has a certain meaning, regardless of whether it actually does, they will take very real actions in consequence.\n\nMerton took the concept a step further and applied it to recent social phenomena. In his book \"Social Theory and Social Structure\", he conceives of a bank run at the fictional Last National Bank, over which Cartwright Millingville presides. It is a typical bank, and Millingville has run it honestly and quite properly. As a result, like all banks, it has some liquid assets (cash), but most of its assets are invested in various ventures. Then one day, a large number of customers come to the bank at once—the exact reason is never made clear. Customers, seeing so many others at the bank, begin to worry. False rumours spread that something is wrong with the bank, and more customers rush to the bank to try to get some of their money out while they still can. The number of customers at the bank increases, as does their annoyance and excitement, which in turn fuels the false rumours of the bank's insolvency and upcoming bankruptcy, causing more customers to come and try to withdraw their money. At the beginning of the day—the last one for Millingville's bank—the bank was not insolvent. But the rumour of insolvency caused a sudden demand of withdrawal of too many customers, which could not be answered, causing the bank to become insolvent and declare bankruptcy. Merton concludes this example with the following analysis:\n\nMerton concluded that the only way to break the cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy is by redefining the propositions on which its false assumptions are originally based.\n\nIn economic \"expectations models\" of inflation, peoples' expectations of future inflation lead them to spend more today and demand higher nominal interest rates for any savings, since they expect that prices will be rising. This demand for higher nominal interest rates and increased spending in the present, in turn, create inflationary pressure and can cause inflation even if the expectations of future inflation are unfounded. The expectations theory of inflation played a large role in Paul Volcker's actions during his tenure as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve in combating the \"stagflation\" of the 1970s.\n\nPhilosopher Karl Popper called the self-fulfilling prophecy the \"Oedipus effect\":\n\nAn early precursor of the concept appears in Edward Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\": \"During many ages, the prediction, as it is usual, contributed to its own accomplishment\" (chapter I, part II).\n\nExamples abound in studies of cognitive dissonance theory and the related self-perception theory; people will often change their attitudes to come into line with what they profess publicly.\n\nIn the United States, the concept was broadly and consistently applied in the field of public education reform, following the \"War on Poverty\". Theodore Brameld noted: \"In simplest terms, education already projects and thereby reinforces whatever habits of personal and cultural life are considered to be acceptable and dominant.\" The effects of teacher attitudes, beliefs and values, affecting their expectations have been tested repeatedly.\n\nThe phenomenon of the \"inevitability of war\" is a self-fulfilling prophecy that has received considerable study.\n\nThe idea is similar to that discussed by the philosopher William James as \"The Will to Believe.\" But James viewed it positively, as the self-validation of a belief. Just as, in Merton's example, the belief that a bank is insolvent may help create the fact, so too, on the positive side, confidence in the bank's prospects may help brighten them. Similarly, Stock-exchange panic episodes, and speculative bubble episodes, can be triggered with the belief that the stock will go down (or up), thus starting the selling/buying mass move, etc.\n\nA more Jamesian example: a swain, convinced that the fair maiden \"must\" love him, may prove more effective in his wooing than he would had his initial prophecy been defeatist.\n\nThere is extensive evidence of \"Interpersonal Expectation Effects\", where the seemingly private expectations of individuals can predict the outcome of the world around them. The mechanisms by which this occurs are also reasonably well understood: it is simply that our own expectations change our behaviour in ways we may not notice and correct. In the case of the \"Interpersonal Expectation Effects\", others pick up on non-verbal behaviour, which affects their attitudes. A famous example includes a study where teachers were told arbitrarily that random students were \"going to blossom\". Oddly, those random students actually ended the year with significantly greater improvements.\nRosenthal and Jacobson 1968\nOther specific examples discussed in psychology include:\n\nIn Canadian ice hockey, junior league players are selected based on skill, motor coordination, physical maturity, and other individual merit criteria. However, psychologist Robert Barnsley showed that in any elite group of hockey players, 40% are born between January and March, versus the approximately 25% as would be predicted by statistics. The explanation is that in Canada, the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1, and the players who are born in the first months of the year are older by 0–11 months, which at the preadolescent age of selection (nine or ten) manifests into an important physical advantage. The selected players are exposed to higher levels of coaching, play more games, and have better teammates. These factors make them actually become the best players, fulfilling the prophecy, while the real selection criterion was age.\nThe same relative age effect has been noticed in Belgian soccer after 1997, when the start of the selection year was changed from August 1 to January 1.\n\nThis specific form of self-fulfilling prophecy is very common and takes many forms. For example, the expectancy for a political party to act in a certain way—based on race, religion, gender and much more—can eventually lead the said party to imitate the stereotype.\n\nIn literature, self-fulfilling prophecies are often used as plot devices. They have been used in stories for millennia, but have gained a lot of popularity recently in the science fiction genre. They are typically used ironically, with the prophesied events coming to pass due to the actions of one trying to prevent the prophecy (a recent example would be the life of Anakin Skywalker, the fictional Jedi-turned-Sith Lord in George Lucas' \"Star Wars\" saga). They are also sometimes used as comic relief.\n\nMany myths, legends and fairy tales make use of this motif as a central element of narratives that are designed to illustrate inexorable fate, fundamental to the Hellenic world-view. In a common motif, a child, whether newborn or not yet conceived, is prophesied to cause something that those in power do not want to happen. This may be the death of the powerful person; in more light-hearted versions, it is often the marriage of a poor or lower-class child to his own. The events come about, nevertheless, as a result of the actions taken to prevent them: frequently child abandonment sets the chain of events in motion.\n\nThe best known example from Greek legend is that of Oedipus. Warned that his child would one day kill him, Laius abandoned his newborn son Oedipus to die, but Oedipus was found and raised by others, and thus in ignorance of his true origins. When he grew up, Oedipus was warned that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Believing his foster parents were his real parents, he left his home and travelled to Greece, eventually reaching the city where his biological parents lived. There, he got into a fight with a stranger, his real father, killed him and married his widow, Oedipus' real mother.\n\nAlthough the legend of Perseus opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather Acrisius, and his abandonment with his mother Danaë, the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition—an act that could have happened regardless of Acrisius' response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of the prophecy, so that his attempt to evade it does cause the prophecy to be fulfilled. In still others, Acrisius is one of the wedding guests when Polydectes tried to force Danaë to marry him, and when Perseus turns them to stone with the Gorgon's head; as Polydectes fell in love with Danaë because Acrisius abandoned her at sea, and Perseus killed the Gorgon as a consequence of Polydectes' attempt to get rid of Danaë's son so that he could marry her, the prophecy fulfilled itself in these variants.\n\nGreek historiography provides a famous variant: when the Lydian king Croesus asked the Delphic Oracle if he should invade Persia, the response came that if he did, he would destroy a great kingdom. Assuming this meant he would succeed, he attacked—but the kingdom he destroyed was his own. In such an example, the prophecy prompts someone to action because he is led to expect a favorable result; but he achieves another, disastrous result which nonetheless fulfills the prophecy.\n\nPeople do not necessarily have to unsuccessfully avoid a prophecy in order for the prophecy to be self-fulfilling. For example, when it was predicted that Zeus would overthrow his father, Cronos, and usurp his throne as King of the Gods, he actively waged war against him in a direct attempt to fulfill this prophecy. This makes the prophecy a self-fulfilling one because it was the prophecy itself that gave Zeus the inspiration to do it in the first place.\n\nThe story of Romulus and Remus is another example. According to legend, a man overthrew his brother, the king. He then ordered that his two nephews, Romulus and Remus, be drowned, fearing that they would someday kill him like he did to his brother. The boys were placed in a basket and thrown in the Tiber River. A wolf found the babies and she raised them. Later, a shepherd found the twins and named them Romulus and Remus. As teenagers, they found out who they were. They killed their uncle, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nAnother example of a self-fulfilling prophecy is detailed by the Greek historian Herodotus in his account of Cyrus the Great's life. In this account, Astyages had two prophetic dreams. Both dreams involved something particular (in the first dream, a flood, while in the second dream, a fruit bearing vine) emerging from his daughter Mandane's pelvis and covering the entirety of Asia. After consulting the Magi, he was informed that the dreams\nforeshadowed the birth of a child who would eventually rule in his place. Terrified by the prophecies, Astyages summoned Harpagus and commanded him to kill the child after it's born. Harpagus, however, was reluctant to kill the child and so assigned the task to one of Astyages' cowherds. The cowherd likewise hesitated and so he and his wife devised a plan to expose their own child, that was born dead, to a desolate place in the mountains while raising the other child as their own. The child was afterwards named Cyrus. One day, when Cyrus was 10 years old, an incident with one of the children he was playing with brought him before king Astyages to give account for his actions. While listening to Cyrus' words, Astyages became suspicious that Cyrus could be the child he wanted to kill. After pressuring his cowherd to relay to him everything about the child, the cowherd finally revealed everything about how he happened upon the child and how he decided to raise him as his own. Astyages, angered with Harpagus summoned him as well and Harpagus likewise revealed the truth. In revenge, the king killed Harpagus' son and later made this act known to Harpagus. However, he spared Cyrus' life as the magi, attempting to further clarify the prophecy to him, accidentally misinterpreted it and thus saved Cyrus. After some time Harpagus, possibly driven by revenge, took advantage of Cyrus' prosperous growth and Astyages' misdeeds to persuade him to revolt against Astyages. His efforts eventually proved successful as Cyrus became king and Astyages was imprisoned. \n\nA variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the self-fulfilling dream, which dates back to medieval Arabic literature. Several tales in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", also known as the \"Arabian Nights\", use this device to foreshadow what is going to happen, as a special form of literary prolepsis. A notable example is \"The Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream\", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of Baghdad and travel to Cairo, where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune after losing belief in the prophecy, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in English folklore as the \"Pedlar of Swaffham\".\n\nAnother variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in \"The Tale of Attaf\", where Harun al-Rashid consults his library (the House of Wisdom), reads a random book, \"falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful \"vizier\"\" Ja'far ibn Yahya from sight. Ja'far, \"disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in Damascus, involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries.\" After returning to Baghdad, Ja'far reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of reverse causality. In the 12th century, this tale was translated into Latin by Petrus Alphonsi and included in his \"Disciplina Clericalis\". In the 14th century, a version of this tale also appears in the \"Gesta Romanorum\" and Giovanni Boccaccio's \"The Decameron\".\n\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies appear in classical Sanskrit literature. In the story of Krishna in the Indian epic \"Mahabharata\", the ruler of the Mathura kingdom, Kansa, afraid of a prophecy that predicted his death at the hands of his sister Devaki's son, had her cast into prison where he planned to kill all of her children at birth. After killing the first six children, and Devaki's apparent miscarriage of the seventh, Krishna (the eighth son) was born. As his life was in danger he was smuggled out to be raised by his foster parents Yashoda and Nanda in the village of Gokula. Years later, Kansa learned about the child's escape and kept sending various demons to put an end to him. The demons were defeated at the hands of Krishna and his brother Balarama. Krishna, as a young man returned to Mathura to overthrow his uncle, and Kansa was eventually killed by his nephew Krishna. It was due to Kansa's attempts to prevent the prophecy that led to it coming true, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nOleg of Novgorod was a Varangian prince who ruled over the Rus people during the early tenth century. As old East Slavic chronicles say, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg's stallion would be the source of Oleg's death. To avoid this he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. In the Primary Chronicle, Oleg is known as the Prophet, ironically referring to the circumstances of his death. The story was romanticized by Alexander Pushkin in his celebrated ballad \"The Song of the Wise Oleg\". In Scandinavian traditions, this legend lived on in the saga of Orvar-Odd.\n\nMany fairy tales, such as \"The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs\", \"The Fish and the Ring\", \"The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars\", or \"The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate\", revolve about a prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl (or, less frequently, a poor girl a rich boy). This is story type 930 in the Aarne–Thompson classification scheme. The girl's father's efforts to prevent it are the reason why the boy ends up marrying her.\n\nAnother fairy tale occurs with older children. In \"The Language of the Birds\", a father forces his son to tell him what the birds say: that the father would be the son's servant. In \"The Ram\", the father forces his daughter to tell him her dream: that her father would hold an ewer for her to wash her hands in. In all such tales, the father takes the child's response as evidence of ill-will and drives the child off; this allows the child to change so that the father will not recognize his own offspring later and so offer to act as the child's servant.\n\nIn some variants of \"Sleeping Beauty\", such as \"Sun, Moon, and Talia\", the sleep is not brought about by a curse, but a prophecy that she will be endangered by flax (or hemp) results in the royal order to remove all the flax or hemp from the castle, resulting in her ignorance of the danger and her curiosity.\n\nShakespeare's \"Macbeth\" is another classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The three witches give Macbeth a prophecy that Macbeth will eventually become king, but afterwards, the offspring of his best friend will rule instead of his own. Macbeth tries to make the first half true while trying to keep his bloodline on the throne instead of his friend's. Spurred by the prophecy, he kills the king and his friend, something he, arguably, never would have done before. In the end, the evil actions he committed to avoid his succession by another's bloodline get him killed in a revolution.\n\nThe later prophecy by the first apparition of the witches that Macbeth should \"Beware Macduff\" is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Macbeth had not been told this, then he might not have regarded Macduff as a threat. Therefore, he would not have killed Macduff's family, and Macduff would not have sought revenge and killed Macbeth.\n\nSimilar to Oedipus above, a more modern example would be Darth Vader in the \"Star Wars\" films, or Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter franchise and the Big Three in Percy Jackson & the Olympians - each attempted to take steps to prevent action against them which had been predicted could cause their downfall, but instead \"created\" the conditions leading to it. Another, less well-known, modern example occurred with the character John Mitchell on BBC Three's \"Being Human\". The Disney television series \"That's So Raven\" stars Raven-Symoné as the title character with the ability to see into the future with a strange situation. The extreme steps that the character takes to prevent the situation are almost always what lead to it.\n\nThe law of attraction is a typical example of self-fulfilling prophecy. It is the name given to the belief that \"like attracts like\" and that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, one can bring about positive or negative results. According to this law, all things are created first by imagination, which leads to thoughts, then to words and actions. The thoughts, words and actions held in mind affect someone's intentions which makes the expected result happen. Although there are some cases where positive or negative attitudes can produce corresponding results (principally the placebo and nocebo effects), there is no scientific basis to the law of attraction.\n\nA self-fulfilling prophecy may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be \"truly\" known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. Predestination does not necessarily involve a supernatural power, and could be the result of other \"infallible foreknowledge\" mechanisms. Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in Newcomb's paradox. A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play \"Oedipus Rex\", in which Oedipus becomes the king of Thebes, whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling. The movie \"12 Monkeys\" heavily deals with themes of predestination and the Cassandra complex, where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he cannot change the past.\n\n"}

Solo dancers are usually the best dancers in a group or dance school. Most solo dancers start after about 6–7 years of dance or sooner. Most soloists are company kids of their dance school. They are usually in more than one dance.\n\nIn Comparsas, there are various soloists who strut in front. They usually dance at the edges of the street so that the viewing public can appreciate their moves. Most male soloists carry a large lantern-like artifact on a large pole, resting on an oily pouch, which they make spin at will. Dance is a way to express emotions.\n\n"}

This was due to an agreement signed between DR and the press in 1926 which guaranteed the press' control of the broadcast of news on television and radio. The agreement remained in place after the introduction of television and was rescinded on 1 July 1964.\n\nInitially, \"TV Avisen\" mostly consisted of footage from foreign news agencies with a musical accompaniment in the style of a newsreel. The programme began broadcasting in colour in October 1978. Five years later, the television news operation moved from its small studios at Radiohuset in Rosenørns Allé to TV-Byen in Gladsaxe.\n\nIn 1988, DR lost its monopoly in Danish television news when second government broadcaster TV2 (founded in 1988) began broadcasting its own news service. In an effort to compete, the main 7.30pm programme was replaced in 1993 by two evening bulletins at 6pm and 8.30pm. The following year, the programmes were moved half an hour later to 6.30pm and 9pm.\n\nIn 2006, the morning edition of \"TV Avisen\" was axed due to low viewing figures. In the same year, DR's television, radio and online operations were combined in the new DR Byen complex in Copenhagen. TV Avisen received a new design and began broadcasting in widescreen. In 2012, the late evening programme was moved to 9.30pm on Monday - Thursday nights. On June 13 2017, TV Avisen was rebranded with updated titles and a new studio design.\n\n\nTV Avisen always begins with a short summary of the news. The top story tends to concern a Danish issue. TV Avisen has its own permanent correspondents in Washington DC, New York City, Rome, Brussels, China and the Middle East, as well as a special climate correspondent.\n\nAs is usual for Danish television, reports which contain foreign languages (for example interviews with foreign politicians or foreign press conferences) are not dubbed in Danish, but subtitled. \n\nAll TV Avisen programmes from the previous 30 days are available from the DR website. Livestreaming is only possible when using an IP address from Denmark.\n"}

The play debuted at London's Royal National Theatre on 9 October 2013 with music and lyrics by Amos and book and lyrics by Australian playwright and screenwriter Samuel Adamson.\n\nThe story centres around teenage princess Althea of Lagobel who lost gravity when refusing to mourn over her mother’s death and is therefore bound to float above ground. When war breaks out Althea, pushed by her father to come to ground and take responsibility, flees only to fall in love with the rivalling kingdoms prince.\n\nThe musical opened to positive reviews in September 2013, starring Rosalie Craig in the titular role, subsequently singled out as a stand-out performance. Craig was nominated for many awards, and ultimately won the Evening Standard's award for best actress in a musical. The choreography, lighting, set design, music (Amos) and other cast performances were also lauded and nominated for a range of awards. In 2014, Amos stated that the production team had ambitions of bringing \"The Light Princess\" to American Broadway, but expressed worry that the original National Theatre production might not be commercial enough for the American audience.\n\nThe Original Cast Recording features 30 original recordings by the cast plus three bonus tracks, including two performed by Amos.\n\nAn early incarnation of the song \"Coronation\" appeared on Tori Amos's seasonal album Midwinter Graces in 2009. Then known as \"Winter's Carol\", much of the song's core melody remains the same as the version that would become \"Coronation\". In its place as the closing number of \"The Light Princess\", the lyrics, structure and arrangements have been almost completely re-written, though some lyrical content remains similar to \"Winter's Carol\".\n"}
