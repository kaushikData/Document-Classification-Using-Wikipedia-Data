It was first released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux in late 2016, followed by PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in 2017, after a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2015. A Nintendo Switch release is planned in 2018.\n\n\"99Vidas\" is a side-scrolling beat 'em up featuring six playable characters (with five more unlocked through multiple play sessions, bringing the total number of playable characters to 11), and multiple cooperative and competitive game modes, for up to four players, which can be played either locally or online.\n\nEach character has unique attributes, like speed and strength, as well as an elemental alignment (Fire, Water, Wind, Lightning, et al.), which modify their regular attacks, combos and special moves. Different from more traditional games of the genre, characters gain experience points by defeating enemies and collecting special items which can then be used by the player to upgrade their abilities and combos, or even unlock new ones.\n\nPlayable either Online or Locally. Can be played solo or with up to four players cooperatively. Players progress through the story, fighting the enemy forces, in pursuit of the \"99Vidas\".\n\nPlayable either Online or Locally. Two to four players can play head-to-head competitive matches, until there's only one standing.\n\nPlayable either Online or Locally. Can be played solo or with up to four players cooperatively. Players face several waves of enemies, with a limited number of lives and an ever-increasing difficulty, for the top spot on the Leaderboards.\n\n\"99Vidas\" is set in a fictional anachronic universe, inspired by video games and the pop culture of the 1980s and 1990s. The game begins when an artifact known as \"99Vidas\" goes missing. This artifact is believed to hold such great power it could bring darkness and chaos to our very existence, should it ever fall into the hands of those with evil intents. As the Guardians of the \"99Vidas\", granted the Power of the Elements, bound to live through the ages to protect the artifact, it is your responsibility to face the forces of evil, defeat the Evil Boss and his six henchmen, and retrieve the \"99Vidas\".\n\nThe development of \"99Vidas\" started in early 2015 as a project of developer QuByte Interactive in partnership with the Gaming Podcast \"99Vidas\" from Brazil. The idea was to develop a brand new beat 'em up that would both pay tribute to the classics of the genre while also updating the gameplay with more modern elements.\n\nPrior to initiating a crowdfunding campaign the developers wanted to have something to show the backers so they could better understand the concept behind the game, so a first demo was developed using Unity featuring hand-drawn sprites and sound samples to emulate the look and feel of the 16-bit. After the demo was completed, the decision to start a crowdfunding campaign was announced in July 2015.\n\nThe initial goal was to raise R$80,000.00 Brazilian Real for the Steam version of the game. The campaign went on to raise a total of R$127,309.78, enabling the development of the console versions – PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One. Simultaneous to the crowdfunding campaign the games was also submitted to the Steam Greenlight process, which was cleared in less than a week following approval by the Steam Community, allowing the developers to self-publish the game on the Steam digital marketplace.\n\nThe game was then released on December 22, 2016 on Steam and on July 18, 2017 on PS Store for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.\n"}

It is loosely based on actual events and was filmed in Taiwan in 1979. It was screened at the Cannes Film Festival on 18 May 1981.\n\nThe film is noted for starring Mel Gibson and Sam Neill, who were relatively unknown in the US at the time but who went on to become international stars. The plot concerns Captain P.G. Kelly (Gibson), who leads a team from the elite Z Special Unit against the Empire of Japan during the Second World War. The film fictionalises the exploits of the Z Special Unit, which was also known as Z Force. It was a joint Australian, British and New Zealand commando unit. Its main brief was to conduct reconnaissance and sabotage missions throughout Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia.\n\nIn the Straits of Sembaleng, five men are dispatched by submarine in Klepper canoes to rescue survivors of a shot-down plane on a nearby island which is occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army. Led by Paul Kelly (Gibson), an inexperienced commando officer, the team secretly lands on the island and hides their kayaks. As they venture in land, Ted 'Kingo' King is hit by fire from an unseen machine gun post, the team quickly eliminates the Japanese defenders and return to their wounded comrade. King has been hit on the leg, the bullet smashing his kneecap. King cannot be allowed to fall into enemy hands and compromise the mission under interrogation, and after sharing a cigarette with him, Costello shoots him. The four remaining men return to their search; coming across a rice farmer, they learn of the area in which the plane crashed. The rice farmer is also killed in order to preserve secrecy.\n\nBut as they near their destination they spot a Japanese squad at a local house, after the Japanese leave they enter the house and meet the local resistance leader Lin, his grown up daughter Chien Hua and her younger brothers and sisters. With a guide to lead them, they head off to the plane but are attacked by Japanese soldiers at a Buddhist temple. Separated from the rest, interpreter Jan Veitch ends up returning to Lin's house where Chien Hua hides him from the returning Japanese. After the deaths of their soldiers, the Japanese officers Watanabe and Imanaka torture Chien to tell them the location of her father, who they believe is hiding the survivors of the crashed plane, but Chien Hua refuses. Lin's son Shaw Hu falsely tells the Japanese that Lin, the Z men, and the plane's survivors are heading for the island's capital. All the Japanese leave except for two soldiers guarding Chien Hua; Veitch kills both with help of Shaw Hu.\n\nMeanwhile, within sight of the plane, Kelly watches as locals blow up the wreckage. Lin is evasive, and after quizzing the inhabitants of a village, the team head on to the plane. Kelly manages to get Lin to tell them that the two survivors are being taken to his home, so they turn around and head back. In the capital, Veitch is led to the survivors. One of them is a defecting Japanese government official Imoguchi, and he is believed to hold a secret that could end the war faster. Only Kelly knows that he must be rescued at any cost - or killed. As the pieces of the puzzle begin to fall together, Kelly must persuade his own men that Imoguchi is worth rescuing and the local resistance that it is worth fighting against their Japanese enemies.\n\nThe script was based on a real-life commando rescue raid, Operation Opossum, where a team of commandos rescued the local sultan on the Japanese-held island of Ternate near Borneo.\n\nThe film was originally entitled \"The Z Men\" and was to be directed by Phillip Noyce. Pre production commenced in Taiwan where for six weeks Noyce worked on the script with writer Michael Cove. However, Noyce clashed with the producers - McCallum later claimed in particular that Noyce refused to use one of the Chinese actors who had been cast in a small role - and was fired the night before shooting was meant to start. He was replaced by Tim Burstall in November 1979.\n\nFilming was further delayed by constant rain and re-writing of the script. Among the changes made were adding a fifth character to the team - a soldier played by John Waters who would be killed within the opening ten minutes by one of their own men.\n\n\"Attack Force Z\" was only released theatrically in Australia in Melbourne, where it took $88,000 at the box office, which is equivalent to $256,080 in 2009 dollars. After the film's release, Tim Burstall was quoted as saying;\nMel Gibson later called the film \"pretty woeful... it's so bad, it's funny.\"\n\nJohn McCallum later said he and Robinson wanted to make another film in Asia, about drug running in Thailand \"starting from the poppies and the hill factories where they distil the damned suff and send it down to Bangkok\" but were not allowed to make it because of the dangers involved in filming in Thailand.\n\n\n"}

The game is built on personal memories, interactive comics, and authentic footage. Characters in the game and their stories are fictional, but they are based on personal testimonies and extensive historical research.\n\nThe game was developed by scientists from the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University and the Institute of Contemporary History of the Czech Academy of Sciences. \"Attentat 1942\" stems from the educational project \"Czechoslovakia 38-89\", but has been enhanced and further developed for the worldwide public. The game was released for Windows and Mac on the distributional platform Steam on October 31, 2017. The game is available in Czech with English, Russian, and German subtitles and is readily found on several websites.\n\n\"Attentat 1942\" is a point-and-click adventure game in which players assume the role of the grandchild of Jindřich Jelínek. They discover that his grandfather was arrested by the Gestapo shortly after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, ruler of the Nazi-occupied Czech Lands and leading architect of the Holocaust. The players' goal is to find out the reason why the grandfather was arrested and what role he played in the attack. The players pose questions to the grandmother and other eyewitnesses of those events and slowly discover the story of the family and learn more about life in Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nThe game holds 75% on Metacritic based on 13 reviews indicating generally favorable reviews.\n\nFrom the reviews:\n\n\n\nThe game was released worldwide on Steam (software) on October 2017, except in Germany where it was blocked due to the German practice of not giving ratings to games containing Nazi symbolism. On May 2018, \"Attentat 1942\" won the \"Most Amazing Game\" Award at the A MAZE festival in Berlin, but the visitors could not play it. They could only watch a censored trailer with no Nazi symbolism included. Meanwhile, the jury played the game behind closed doors. In August 2018, the policy of USK, the authority providing age ratings for video games, was changed and now allows that games with Nazi symbolism to receive age ratings, depending on their individual \"social adequacy.\" \"Attentat 1942\" was therefore released in Germany as the first PC game with Nazi symbolism with the USK age rating received after the policy change.\n"}

The IceAFL was founded in 2009, and regular competition commenced in 2010. The league is the world's most northerly Australian Rules Football league.\n\nAustralian rules football has been played in Iceland since 20 May 2009, when Friðgeir Torfi Ásgeirsson, who had played in the Danish Australian Football League, placed an ad in a local newspaper and put up flyers at pubs and schools around Reykjavik looking for players. A group of seven people gathered that afternoon at the far end of the Reykjavik Pond.\nBefore the first club was founded in Iceland, a national team, named the Icelandic Ravens, had been assembled for the 2009 EU Cup. The first teams were founded in April 2010 and are known as the Dragons, Eagles and Bulls. The team names come from Iceland's coat of arms, leaving the Giant as the only symbol unaccounted for.\n\nThe current (2017) president is Friðgeir Torfi Ásgeirsson.\n\nThere are three clubs currently playing Australian Rules Football in Iceland. They play each other in the nine-a-side IceAFL league. The league was founded in 2009 by Friðgeir Torfi Ásgeirsson, who is the current league president.

Despite its nickname, the building is not an actual cube, but a cuboid (a rectangular box). Ground was broken on December 24, 2003, and the Center was completed and handed over for use on January 28, 2008. Swimmers at the Water Cube broke 25 world records during the 2008 Olympics.\n\nAfter the 2008 Olympics the building underwent a 200 -million yuan revamp to turn half of its interior into a water park. The building officially reopened on August 8, 2010. It will host the curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn July 2003 the Water Cube design was chosen from 10 proposals in an international architectural competition for the aquatic center project.\nThe Water Cube was specially designed and built by a consortium made up of PTW Architects (an Australian architecture firm), Arup international engineering group, CSCEC (China State Construction Engineering Corporation), and CCDI (China Construction Design International) of Shanghai. The Water Cube's design was initiated by a team effort: the Chinese partners felt a square was more symbolic to Chinese culture and its relationship to the Bird's Nest stadium, while the Sydney-based partners came up with the idea of covering the 'cube' with bubbles, symbolising water. Contextually the cube symbolises earth whilst the circle (represented by the stadium) represents heaven. Hence symbolically the water cube references Chinese symbolic architecture.\n\nComprising a steel space frame, it is the largest ETFE-clad structure in the world with over 100,000 m² of ETFE pillows that are only 0.2 mm (1/125 of an inch) in total thickness. The ETFE cladding, supplied and installed by the firm Vector Foiltec, allows more light and heat penetration than traditional glass, resulting in a 30% decrease in energy costs.\n\nThe outer wall is based on the Weaire–Phelan structure, a structure devised from the natural pattern of bubbles in soap lather. In the true Weaire-Phelan structure the edge of each cell is curved in order to maintain 109.5 degree angles at each vertex (satisfying Plateau's rules), but of course as a structural support system each beam was required to be straight so as to better resist axial compression. The complex Weaire–Phelan pattern was developed by slicing through bubbles in soap foam, resulting in more irregular, organic patterns than foam bubble structures proposed earlier by the scientist Kelvin. Using the Weaire–Phelan geometry, the Water Cube's exterior cladding is made of 4,000 ETFE bubbles, some as large as across, with seven different sizes for the roof and 15 for the walls.\n\nThe structure had a capacity of 17,000 during the games that is being reduced to 7,000. It also has a total land surface of 65,000 square meters and will cover a total of . Although called the Water Cube, the aquatic center is really a rectangular box (cuboid) square and high. The building's popularity has spawned many copycat structures throughout China. For example, there is one-to-one copy of the facade near the ferry terminal in Macau – the \"Casino Oceanus\" by Paul Steelman.\n\nThe Aquatics Center hosted the swimming, diving, and synchronized swimming events during the Olympics. Water polo was originally planned to be hosted in the venue but was moved to the Ying Tung Natatorium.\n\nMany people believed the Water Cube to be the fastest Olympic pool in the world. It is 1.314 meters deeper than most Olympic pools. The London 2012 Aquatics Centre is the same depth, which leads many to believe the London pool is as fast as, if not faster than, the Beijing pool. Up to a certain limit, beyond which swimmers will lose their sense of vision, deeper pools allow the waves to dissipate to the bottom, leading to less water disturbance to the swimmers. The pool also has perforated gutters on both sides to absorb the waves.\n\nThe Aquatics Center saw 25 world records broken in the Beijing Olympics; however, all the records broken were accomplished by athletes using the super-slick swimwear which has become banned at the beginning of the 2010 season by the International Swimming Federation (FINA).\n\nAfter the Olympics, the Water Cube was opened to the public on select days of the week beginning in June 2009, and was also used as the site for a production of \"Swan Lake\" amongst other shows. On October 19, 2009, the Water Cube was closed to the public to begin a massive renovation of a portion of the complex into a water park. The building reopened on August 8, 2010, marking the second anniversary of the beginning of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The redesigned facility contains numerous water rides and slides, a wave pool, and spa areas. The renovations were performed in order to bring renewed interest to the Olympic Green area as part of the games' legacy.\n\nThe Water Cube will be used for curling during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.\n\n\n\n"}

The game features many new features and units over its predecessor; the graphics engine is upgraded, allowing for full 3D and the game features over 250 units compared to \"Blitzkrieg\"'s 200. In Blitzkrieg 2, you can choose from three separate campaigns: The Nazi German Campaign, the American Campaign, and the Soviet Campaign, each divided into four distinct chapters. The German campaign begins in France, 1940, where you are put in command of German offensive forces in an effort to conquer France. Here, you may use the signature Blitzkrieg strategy. The second chapter is set in North Africa, which ends with your capture of Tobruk. The third is in the Soviet Union, during Case Blue. And finally, the fourth chapter is staged in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge, 1944. The American campaign has its first 3 chapters in the Pacific theater, where you lead your forces against the IJA (Imperial Japanese Army) and IJN (Imperial Japanese Navy) in a number of missions beginning shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

It offered light entertainment \"such as magic acts, singing, dancing, minstrel shows,\" as well as sexual services. Box houses were an antecedent of American vaudeville.\n\nMurray Morgan describes a box house as \"a saloon with a theater attached,\" which \"competed with establishments offering even rougher entertainment.\" Many of Seattle's box houses in the wide-open \"restricted district\" below Yesler Way were located in basements and operated only in the dry season, because they flooded in the wet winter. Others were built over the tideflats and would dump over-rowdy customers into the water through trap doors.\n\nMorgan quotes a contemporary article in \"Coast Magazine\" describing the Theater-Comique, a typical box house:\n\nA nervous opium-eating individual was hammering away at a piano. … Not a woman was to be seen in the row of seats… Around the sides of the room and at the end opposite the stage were built out of thin pine boards apartments with an opening toward the platform and a barn-like door leading into the narrow passageway along the wall. In each room was an electric torch button which communicated with a bar set up behind the stage. The boxes were unlighted… In these boxes were women, one in some, more in others. … Women with dresses [reaching] nearly to the point above their knees, with stained and sweaty tights, with bare arms and necks uncovered halfway to their waists\n\nSome of the box houses were not as \"low\" as this: at least one, run by a supposedly titled Englishman featured women in evening gowns and humor at the level of the \"double entendre\". The \"king\" of Seattle's box houses was John Considine, originally an actor, who raised the level of entertainment and eventually became a pioneer of vaudeville.\n\n"}

Its headquarters are located in an old gramophone factory in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In 2018, it was acquired by Microsoft.\n\nCompulsion Games was founded in 2009 by Guillaume Provost; previously he had worked for companies such as Arkane Studios in France.\n\nProvost decided to start his own business and recruited within an old gramophone factory a team including Alex Epstein (narrative director) and Whitney Clayton (art director). The team's previous experiences range from working with Valve on \"The Orange Box\" to Ubisoft with \"Far Cry 3\". To raise money for \"Contrast\", their first game, the team worked on projects such as \"Darksiders\", \"\", Bagelburg: The Bagelening, and even \"Arthur Christmas: Elf Run\" for iOS.\n\nAt E3 2018, Microsoft announced they entered into an agreement to acquire Compulsion Games.\n\nThe team has produced two games, \"Contrast\" and \"We Happy Few\".\n\n\"Contrast\" was a PlayStation 4 launch title. The central theme of the title is the care for children. The title is a twilight adventure suspended in Belle Époque magics and Art Nouveau aesthetics, with a film noir atmosphere and haunting soundtrack (\"Shadow Music: A Soundtrack to Contrast\"). \"Contrast\" is set in the 1920s, blending influences from the 1920s Burlesque and Vaudeville era with some more classic film-noir elements from the 1940s. The player controls Dawn, the imaginary friend of a little girl, Didi, who has the power to turn into her own shadow. She can do this any time, provided there is a lit area where Dawn's shadow can be seen. The original gameplay is based on the interplay of shadows and lights; Dawn has the ability to transit from the colorful 3D world of the streets of Paris into the two-dimensional world of shadows, flattening herself on the walls of buildings or rooms. The player can face unusual 2D platform levels, provided the presence of favorable sources of light that can be moved to solve the puzzles. Provost worked with Valve around the time that the original video game \"Portal\" was released, and was inspired by how the \"Portal\" series encouraged people to think about space in different ways. The idea of 2D shadow/3D world interaction came to him in a coffee shop in France, and seemed to be a great way of exploring new puzzle mechanics. The film noir world, and the narrative, flowed from this concept.\n\n\"We Happy Few\" is a \"cheerful\" dystopia set in a fictional English city, Wellington Wells, which is inspired by the psychedelic London of the '60s. It is about a retrofuturistic-fashioned society formed following an alternate timeline of events within World War II, which is on the verge of collapse in the mid-1960s. The residents of the city, seeking to forget an unspeakable horror they committed, began taking a hallucinogenic drug called \"Joy\" that makes them happy, but also leaves them easily controlled and lacking morality and understanding of anything else. Players will control one of three characters in the full release, who becomes dubbed as a \"Downer\" after choosing to stop using Joy, and must try to survive long enough to complete something important and personal to themselves, all while trying to escape the city before the impending social collapse. Played from a first-person perspective, the game combines role-playing, survival, and light roguelike elements, with the developers focusing on creating a story with strong narratives, gameplay underlined by a sense of paranoia, and decisions having moral gray areas and weight that influence and affect later parts of the game. This peculiar mix of laughter and dystopia, another \"contrast\" after the lights and shadows of the previous title, is inspired by the film \"Brazil\" by Terry Gilliam, in turn inspired by the quintessential dystopian novel, George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". In the first trailers, traces of Stanley Kubrick's film \"A Clockwork Orange\" can be recognized. The aesthetic style resembles \"BioShock Infinite\" because Compulsion Games seems particularly linked to the Art Deco style, also present in \"Contrast\". The world of We Happy Few is procedurally generated. The company filmed a video to present the game to the masses. It explains the lore, reveals some characters, such as Percy and Uncle Jack, and teases the adapted alternate history setting of the game.\n\nCompulsion Games' third video game will be the first video game developed and published exclusively for the Microsoft Windows and Xbox One platforms ever since the announcement by Phil Spencer the head of Microsoft Studios that Compulsion Games was purchased by the Microsoft Corporation at the 2018 Xbox Electronic Entertainment Expo Event in the city of Los Angeles in June 2018.\n"}

It was released February 22, 2011 on the PlayStation 3 and February 25, 2011 on the Xbox 360. A portable version was developed by Freeverse was initially released for iOS on February 5, 2009. It was later ported to the PlayStation Portable on June 1, 2011. It is a spinoff of the 1990 film \"Days of Thunder\" in which the player is a rookie driver coached by Rowdy Burns, the antagonist from the film. The game received very little reception from critics; those that did review the game had generally negative commentary. Reviewers felt that the cars handled unrealistically, but one reviewer noted that some issues could be fixed with a patch.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 version of the game includes 12 NASCAR sanctioned tracks, among them Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway, and more than 12 select NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers, including Denny Hamlin, Ryan Newman and Tony Stewart. All versions feature the \"Days of Thunder\" characters Cole Trickle, Rowdy Burns, and Russ Wheeler. The Xbox 360 version does not feature NASCAR branding or drivers, but still features fictional drivers from the film.\n\nBoth versions feature a single player season and multiplayer support for up to twelve players. \"Days of Thunder\" has four different game modes: Quick Race, Time Trial, Career, with circuits of varying difficulty, and Derby Mode, where players are encouraged to deal as much damage as they can. Three basic vehicle types are available in the game; Accelerators are lighter cars with increased speed but are more susceptible to damage, Intimidators are heavier and more capable of handling damage, but have a lower top speed, finally Regulators have a medium weight, medium top speed, and have average damage resistance.\n\nSponsorships with racing teams can be earned by playing through the game and completing challenges. When a sponsor is earned a new paint livery is unlocked for the player to customize their stock car with. Players can have up to five different saved cars, and each car can feature a different paint scheme and sponsorship. The sponsorship benefits are cosmetic only. Matthew Newman, Producer at Piranha Games stated that the game \"is not a simulation, we chose to let the player unlock all the sponsors and race for whichever sponsor they choose in single player and multi player.\"\n\n\"Days of Thunder: NASCAR Edition\" was announced for the PlayStation 3 on June 11, 2010. The Xbox 360 \"Arcade\" version was announced on October 27, 2010. In an interview with producer Jeff Dickson, the history behind the game was revealed. The game was created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the \"Days of Thunder\" film. The \"NASCAR Edition\" is intended to be a union of NASCAR and the film, and features drivers from the movie as well as NASCAR drivers from the past and present (Hendrick Motorsports was actively involved in the film during 1989 and 1990 filmings, providing cars and technical support; also the film's storyline was based on a former Hendrick driver). Both versions of the game were designed with arcade-based gameplay. During development trailers fictional drivers had liveries coinciding with Paramount Pictures and \"Days of Thunder\", as well as other Paramount Pictures films such as \"Top Gun\", \"Transformers\" and \"Iron Man 2\". At release only the \"Days of Thunder\", Paramount Pictures, and other fictional racing liveries/sponsors remained. Michael Rooker returns to voice the character Rowdy Burns in the game.\n\nWhen asked why the game would not be a simulation, Dickson replied, \"Well, we wanted to stay away from that because the games that are out there that do that do it well.\" Developer Piranha Games wanted to ensure that players spent most of their time on the track, so aside from visual modifications, the ability to customize cars is limited. \"We don't want you to spend lots of time outside the game, we want you on the race track,\" stated Dickson. The AI drivers in the game were designed to adapt to the player's typical racing style. \"If you're kind of an aggressive driver, they're gonna drive aggressive against you,\" Dickson remarked. The game was released exclusively in North American regions for the PlayStation 3 on February 22, 2011, and for the Xbox 360 on February 25, 2011. A retail version of the PlayStation 3 version was bundled with the Blu-ray of the namesake movie, released on June 7, 2011. A portable version developed by Freeverse was initially released for iOS on February 5, 2009 . It was later ported to the PlayStation Portable on June 1, 2011. Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows versions were planned, but eventually cancelled.\n\n\"Days of Thunder\" received very little critical reception, with only one review published for the PlayStation 3 \"NASCAR Edition\" and very few published for the Xbox 360 \"Arcade\" version. Of the reviews published critics gave generally negative reviews. The PlayStation 3 version single GameRankings score comes from the reviewer from PSNStores, who gave the game a 3/5. The critic gave high marks for the PlayStation 3 version's inclusion of real-world NASCAR drivers, but was disappointed in the lack of customization. Two scores were reported at GameRankings for the Xbox 360 version, from the US and UK editions of \"Official Xbox Magazine\". The scored the game a 3/10 and 2/10, respectively.\n\nScott Ellison of Saving Content panned the PlayStation 3 version of the game. He stated \"simply put, do not buy this game.\" Steve Melton of XBLA Fans agreed. He felt that with a title update the game could improve, but that it felt \"like it was a contract job.\" The vehicle physics and handling were particular points of negative commentary. Ellison said that \"the cars feel as if they don’t have any weight to them.\" Melton concurred and added that the handling was overly sensitive. \"Sneeze and the car’ll be in the wall\", he stated. Melton did concede that the steering could be adjusted in the game's options, but that the default configuration would dissuade most players from even looking there. In the May 2011 issue of \"Official Xbox Magazine\" the game also received extremely poor reception. The reviewer stated \"Do yourself a favor: stay as far away from this wreck as possible.\" Levi Buchanan of IGN scored the iOS version of the game much higher than the average on other platforms. He stated that \"\"Days of Thunder\" succeeds as both a silly and serious game.\" He further noted that the game's many cars and tracks gave it lasting appeal on the iPhone.\n\n"}

The franchise focuses on Digimon creatures, which are monsters living in a \"Digital World\", a parallel universe that originated from Earth's various communication networks.\n\nThe franchise was first created in 1997 as a series of virtual pets, akin to—and influenced in style by—the contemporary Tamagotchi or nano Giga Pet toys. The creatures were first designed to look cute and iconic even on the devices' small screens; later developments had them created with a harder-edged style influenced by American comics. The franchise gained momentum with its first anime incarnation, \"Digimon Adventure\", and an early video game, \"Digimon World\", both released in 1999. Several seasons of the anime and films based on them have aired, and the video game series has expanded into genres such as role-playing, racing, fighting, and MMORPGs. Other media forms have also been released.\n\nIn the year 1996 came the Tamagotchi, created by Akihiro Yokoi, Aki Maita and Takeichi Hongo, which was one of the inspirations for the first release of the franchise, a device marketed in June 1997 with the name Digimon, a short for \"Digital Monster\". Aiming at the male audience and created by Akiyoshi Hongo (a pseudonym that refers to the creators of \"Tamagotchi\"), this device shows to players a virtual pet composed entirely of data and designed to play and fight. In February 1998, the \"DigiMon\" fighting game, compatible with Windows 95 and developed by Rapture Technologies, Inc., was announced. The one-shot manga \"C'mon Digimon\", designed by Tenya Yabuno, was published in the Japanese magazine V-Jump by Shueisha in 1997.\n\nA second generation of \"virtual pets\" was marketed six months after the launch of the first, followed by a third in 1998. Each player starts with a baby-level digital creature that has a limited number of attacks and transformations and to make the creature stronger by training and nourishing the creature; when the player is successful in a workout, the Digimon becomes strong, when the player fails, the Digimon becomes weak. Two devices can be connected, allowing two players to battle with their respective creatures, an innovation at the time, however, the battle is only possible from the moment the creature is in the child level or bigger. Playgrounds and subways were where the majority of users of the apparatus were concentrated; The virtual pet was banned in some Asian schools by being considered by parents and teachers as very noisy and violent. The first Digimon were created by Japanese designer Kenji Watanabe, influenced by American comics, which were beginning to gain popularity in Japan, and as such began to make his characters look stronger and \"cool.\" Other types of Digimon, which until the year 2000 totaled 279, came from extensive discussions and collaborations between the Bandai company members. There are currently over 1300 Digimon.\n\nDigimon hatch from types of eggs which are called . In the English iterations of the franchise there is another type of Digi-Egg that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a in Japanese. They age via a process called \"Digivolution\" which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of intelligence and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. A further level has since been used in the video games, even higher than Mega, known as \"Ultra\" in the dub.\n\nThe \"Digimon\" anime series was produced by Toei Animation and Bandai of Japan. Beginning in 1999, the franchise was given an anime as the first of the \"Digimon\" movies aired in theaters in Japan. Originally, the \"Digimon Adventure\" movie was supposed to be a short film, but after the storyboard was finished, a request for \"Digimon\" becoming a children's television show was made, which later became the basis for \"Digimon Adventure\". Several more series would follow, most of them with their own tie-in movies. The series was dubbed for release in Western markets, with the first four series under the title \"Digimon: Digital Monsters\".\n\n\nSeveral \"Digimon\" featurette films were released in Japan, with some of them seasonal tie-ins for their respective television series. In addition to the, \"\", an American film featuring \"Digimon Adventure\", \"Digimon Adventure: Children's War Game!\", \"Digimon Adventure 02: Part 1: Digimon Hurricane Touchdown!!/Part 2: Supreme Evolution!! The Golden Digimentals\", was released in the United States and Canada by Fox Kids through 20th Century Fox on October 6, 2000.\n\n\nIn the United States, the series premiered in August 1999 on the Fox Broadcasting Company. It was dubbed by Saban Entertainment (later Sensation Animation), and was initially broadcast through Fox Kids. The first four series were collectively retitled \"Digimon: Digital Monsters\". Some scenes from the original version were modified or omitted in order to comply with Fox's standards and practices. The show also featured more jokes and added dialogue, along with a completely different musical score. As a cross-promotional stunt, 2001 and 2002 saw \"Digi-Bowl\" specials co-produced with Fox Sports; \"NFL on Fox\" commentator Terry Bradshaw provided interstitial segments in-between episodes as if the episodes were actually a football game.\n\nAfter Disney acquired Saban during \"Digimon: Digital Monsters (Season 3)\", the first three series moved to the cable network ABC Family, while the fourth (\"Frontier\") premiered on UPN due to a deal between Disney and UPN. UPN aired the show until late August 2003, when they severed their ties to Disney. \"Frontier\" aired on ABC Family concurrently, and reran (alongside the first three seasons) on that channel and Toon Disney (for the latter under the Jetix branding) for several years after. \"Digimon Data Squad\" also had a brief run on Toon Disney/Jetix and successor Disney XD. Toei Animation has however released an official subtitled version of \"Digimon Xros Wars\". Funimation Entertainment has online streaming rights to subtitled versions of \"Digimon Adventure 02\" and \"Digimon Tamers\".\n\nIn September 2012, Saban Brands announced it had re-acquired the \"Digimon\" franchise. In February 2013, Saban acquired \"Digimon Fusion\" for broadcast on Nickelodeon in the United States starting September 7, 2013. After three episodes, the show was moved to Nicktoons starting October 13, 2013.\n\n\"Digimon Adventure\" and its two sequels, \"Digimon Adventure 02\" and \"Digimon Tamers\", were added to the Netflix Instant Streaming service in 2013 and 2014 with Japanese audio and English subtitles. Crunchyroll began streaming the English-subtitled version of \"Digimon Fusion\" outside Japan in November 2011. The English-localized version of its first season became available on Netflix starting September 13, 2014, followed by the second season on March 8, 2016. After Crunchyroll acquired streaming rights to the dubbed versions and Funimation acquired rights to the subtitled versions, the dubbed versions of \"Adventure\", \"Adventure 02\", and \"Tamers\" were briefly removed from Netflix.\n\nIn Canada, the English versions were broadcast on YTV, but only the first 26 episodes of \"Digimon Fusion\" were shown. The dubbed version of \"Data Squad\" aired on Family Channel. In the United Kingdom, \"Digimon: Digital Monsters\" first aired in the UK on subscription cable/satellite channel Fox Kids but gained most popularity on terrestrial channel ITV's children's slot CITV from 2001-2002, which broadcast \"Adventure\", \"Adventure 02\" and a small amount of \"Tamers\" airing during after school hours. The entirety of \"Tamers\" aired on cable/satellite channel Fox Kids from 2002–04. \"Digimon Frontier\" was originally announced on Jetix but was later dropped. The series eventually saw a release on October 29, 2018.. From 2011, \"Digimon Data Squad\" (the fifth series/season) airs in the UK on Kix! (the show's sole provider). According to Fox Kids's (2000–03) and Kix's (2010-) BARB Television ratings, \"Adventure\", \"Adventure 02\" & \"Tamers\" have been the most popular series'/seasons in the United Kingdom and was consistently in the weekly top 10 broadcasts for both channels for new episodes. Broadcast rights and merchandising sub-licensing rights for Digimon Fusion in the UK have been acquired by ITV Studios Global Entertainment, Digimon Fusion has aired since Spring 2014 on Digital Terrestrial Channel, CITV.\n\nDigimon first appeared in narrative form in the one-shot manga \"C'mon Digimon\", released in the summer of 1997. \"C'mon Digimon\" spawned the popular \"Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01\" manga, written by Hiroshi Izawa, which began serialization on November 21, 1998.\n\n\nA Chinese manhua was written and drawn by Yuen Wong Yu (余 遠鍠 \"Yu Yuen-wong\"), who based its storyline on the television series. This adaptation covers \"Digimon Adventure\" in five volumes, \"Digimon Adventure 02\" in two, \"Digimon Tamers\" in four, and \"Digimon Frontier\" in three. The original stories are heavily abridged, though on rare occasions events play out differently from the anime. The Chinese language version was published by Rightman Publishing Ltd. in Hong Kong. Yu also wrote \"D-Cyber\".\n\nTwo English versions were also released. The first one was published by Chuang Yi in Singapore. The second one, which was adapted by Lianne Sentar, was released by TOKYOPOP in North America.<br>The three volumes for \"Digimon Frontier\" have been released by Chuang Yi in English. These have not been released by TOKYOPOP in North America or Europe. However, the Chuang Yi releases of \"Digimon Frontier\" were distributed by Madman Entertainment in Australia.\n\nDark Horse Comics published American-style Digimon comic books, adapting the first thirteen episodes of the English dub of \"Digimon Adventure\" in 2001. The story was written by Daniel Horn and Ryan Hill, and illustrated by Daniel Horn and Cara L. Niece.\n\nThe Italian publishing company, Panini, approached Digimon in different ways in different countries. While Germany created their own adaptations of episodes, the United Kingdom (UK) reprinted the Dark Horse titles, then translated some of the German adaptations of \"Adventure 02\" episodes. Eventually the UK comics were given their own original stories, which appeared in both the UK's official \"Digimon Magazine\" and the official UK Fox Kids companion magazine, \"Wickid\". These original stories only roughly followed the continuity of \"Adventure 02\". When the comic switched to the \"Tamers\" series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original Japanese anime (such as Mitsuo Yamaki's past) or the English adaptations of the television shows and movies (such as Ryo's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005). In a money saving venture, the original stories were later removed from \"Digimon Magazine\", which returned to printing translated German adaptations of \"Tamers\" episodes. Eventually, both magazines were cancelled.\n\nThe Digimon series has a large number of video games which usually have their own independent storylines with a few sometimes tying into the stories of the anime series or manga series. The games consists of a number of genres including life simulation, adventure, video card game, strategy and racing games, though they are mainly action role-playing games. The games released in North America are: \"Digimon World\", \"Digimon World 2\", \"Digimon World 3\", \"Digimon World 4\", \"Digimon Digital Card Battle\", \"Digimon Rumble Arena\", \"Digimon Rumble Arena 2\", \"Digimon Battle Spirit\", \"Digimon Battle Spirit 2\", \"Digimon Racing\", \"Digimon World DS\", \"Digimon World Data Squad\", \"Digimon World Dawn and Dusk\", \"Digimon World Championship\", and \"Digimon Masters\".\n\nIn late 2009, Bandai created a webpage in Japanese showing a new game to be released in 2010 called \"\", which uses the same engine as their predecessors \"Digimon World DS\" and \"Digimon World Dawn and Dusk\" and was released on July 1, 2010. In February 2010, a website for the online multiplayer game, \"Digimon Battle Online\", was launched, showing it to be based primarily in the world of the Tamers saga and its characters.\n\nOn September 22, 2011, online game publisher Joymax announced the release of an MMORPG game called \"Digimon Masters\", which was developed by the Korean publisher DIGITALIC.\n\nIn 2011, Bandai posted a countdown on a teaser site. Once the countdown was finished, it revealed a reboot of the Digimon World series titled \"\". An enhanced version of the game released on Nintendo 3DS as \"Digimon World Re:Digitize Decode\" in 2013.\n\nA new fighting game for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was revealed in the summer of 2014, named \"Digimon All-Star Rumble\". It was released in North America, Europe and Australia in November of the same year. \"\", a role-playing game in the \"Digimon Story\" sub-series, was released in 2015 for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4 in Japan. It has also been released with English subtitles in North America and the rest of the world in 2016.\n\nThe Digimon Collectible Card Game is a card game based on Digimon, first introduced in Japan in 1997 and published by Bandai. The third season (\"Digimon Tamers\") utilized this aspect of the franchise by making the card game an integral part of the season. Versions of the card game are also included in some of the Digimon video games including \"Digital Card Battle\" and \"Digimon World 3\".\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Kyla Pratt, the original daughter in the remake series, as Maya.\n\nStarring alongside her are Kristen Wilson as Lisa Dolittle and Norm Macdonald as the voice of Lucky the Dog. This is the third film in the \"Dr. Dolittle\" series, and the first film not to feature Eddie Murphy as Doctor Dolittle, or Raven-Symoné as Charisse Dolittle, although they are mentioned in the film.\n\nMaya has evolved considerably from the first film. Though she was then an antisocial individual more interested in her science projects, Maya has transformed into the typical teenager. Like her sister Charisse, she inherits their father John's capacity for communicating with fauna (she is a part-time veterinary assistant), her life is turned upside down on all fronts. She routinely lands in trouble with her parents, while her friends think she's gone crazy.\n\nWith John away on animal expeditions, Maya's mother Lisa sends her (with Lucky following along) to a ranch named \"Durango\", so she can find herself. The ranch is owned by Jud (John Amos), and his son Bo (Walker Howard). While there, Maya, who desperately tried to keep it under wraps so as not to arouse suspicion, uses her talent to \"talk to the animals\" in order to save Durango from being taken over by a neighboring ranch.\n\nMaya is at first reluctant to reveal her ability, fearing rejection from her friends, but eventually does so. With her help, the Durango ranch enters a rodeo competition with a $50,000 award, and wins it. Also, she shares her first kiss with Bo and finally wins his heart.\n\n\nThis film was released direct-to-video in 2006; on April 25 for Region 1 and May 1 for Region 2.\n\nAlthough a relative success in sales, the film was not well received by critics.\n\nOf the two reviews given at Rotten Tomatoes, both were very negative: one critic, Scott Weinberg, said \"Cheap-looking, atrociously written, and delivered with all the energy of a breach-birth bovine, Dr. Dolittle 3 is all kinds of terrible.\" David Cornelius of efilmcritic.com described the film as \"not so much poorly made as it is lazy and cheap.\"\n\n"}

Developed for the Experimental Gameplay Project in 2009, the game has been described as \"a beautiful game with a very bleak outlook.\" Italian creator Paolo Pedercini claims it is \"a short existential game about alienation and refusal of labor.\" It has been compared to \"Passage\" by Jason Rohrer and \"Don't Look Back\" by Terry Cavanagh in that it is \"an interesting, potentially fascinating experience.\" The game is offered as freeware under the Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-SA 2.5.\n\nWhile the game lacks a traditional storyline, the course of events has the player control a white collar worker and guide this avatar through the daily grind. If the avatar gets dressed, drives to work, and sits at his cubicle, the dream will restart from the initial bedroom scene. An old woman in the elevator offers the cryptic message: \"5 more steps and you will be a new person.\" Once the player deviates from the predetermined path and initiates five specific interactions, the dream restarts in a new state with the player's avatar as the only person in the game world. When the player next returns to the office and passes the empty cubicles, the avatar stops to watch an identical character leap from the rooftop, and the game ends.\n\nThe game gives the player simple controls, only enough to walk left or right using the arrow keys and interact using the spacebar. Using these limited controls, the gameplay encourages the player to \"subvert the limitations of the world\" however possible until the narrative changes.\n\nMany media outlets noticed the game.\n\nSome find the label \"game\" unfit for this work, offering \"interactive experience\" as a more accurate definition.\n\nGamasutra hosts an article discussing the importance of the game as an example of an interactive medium's capacity \"to offer experiences that passive media can't possibly.\" The game plays especially well on \"natural player tendencies\" and the expectation that the player will seek to \"push the boundaries\" of the game as far as possible. Despite its brevity, the game highlights the value and importance of interactivity, both as a game design principle and for mechanics-as-metaphor. \n\nThe game demonstrates how an interactive work can convey meaning \"every bit as effectively as linear media, perhaps even more so.\" The unique experience of taking agency over someone else's narrative, in this case that of the avatar, allows the player to relate directly to events in the avatar's life, superimpose those events onto the player's own life, and in so doing apply the message of the game to the player's own reality.\n\nSoderman's essay uses the game to argue that the focus on meaning inferred from game mechanics has caused \"new hermeneutical methods\" of interpretation to supersede \"visual and narrative representations\" in terms of importance and consideration. A mechanics-exclusive interpretation of the game ignores key allegoric elements, such as the gradual failure of the company with each act of refusal of labour as presented on the graph at the office, or the simulation of purgatory in the final state devoid of the other characters encountered during previous days. An approach that fails to analyze \"the object from every possible angle\" will inevitably miss the most \"meaningful facets\" of the work.\n\nPedercini originally produced a soundtrack consisting of \"crappy drones [on] an electric guitar.\" The \"thunderous pulsing\" heard in the final version of the game, produced by Jesse Stiles, ultimately replaced Paolo's track.\n\n"}

Distribution, import, or creation of specific films can constitute steep fines.\n\nIn an attempt to shed its violent image, horror films were very rarely made in Germany after the fall of the Third Reich. Movies such as \"Horrors of Spider Island\", \"The Blood Demon\", and \"The Head\" were filmed and released in the decades following World War II, but to very little success.\n\nIn 1987, filmmaker Jörg Buttgereit wrote and directed \"Nekromantik\". Two years later, amateur filmmaker Andreas Schnaas made the movie \"Violent Shit\" for a reported $2000. Released as Germany's first direct-to-video film, it was a modest hit amongst fans of independent horror. Both films were banned by the German government, but their popularity influenced other filmmakers such as Olaf Ittenbach to bring Germany's underground horror film scene further into the media spotlight.\n\nSince then, many other filmmakers have emerged from the German underground horror scene, including Uwe Boll and Timo Rose. Uwe Boll is notable as the only underground German director who has gone on to a career in big budget cinema.\n\nOnce a film has been rated by the German ratings board, that is its rating for both cinema and video releases. It is legal to have two versions of a film. Often, there is a cut \"FSK 16\" version (equivalent to the R-rating by the MPAA) released in cinemas and an uncut \"FSK 18\" version (equivalent to an NC-17 rating) on video. Films rated \"FSK 18\" are not stocked by all video shops, which affects rentals of violent German horror.\n\nIn Germany, there is also a category above \"FSK 18\" entitled \"indiziert\" or \"on the index\". \"Indizierte\" films are treated the same way as pornography. Distribution companies, cinemas, and video shops cannot advertise these films, nor can they be openly on display—unless a shop is open to \"adults only\". However, it is legal to sell and buy such material. Many video rental stores have back rooms or basements for such merchandise. \n\nExamples of \"indizierte\" films include \"Cannibal Ferox\", \"Cannibal Holocaust\", \"Last House on the Left\", \"From Dusk Till Dawn\", and Dario Argento's \"Profondo Rosso\" (Deep Red). Several of these films were released uncut in Germany, but were subject to the limitations listed. Others were edited and then released as \"indiziert\".\n\nSome movies, e.g. \"Braindead\", are completely banned in Germany (mostly for glamorizing violence), as it is illegal even to sell them to adults. These movies are \"indiziert\" as well as \"beschlagnahmt\" (\"judicially confiscated\"). While selling these kinds of media is strictly prohibited, it is legal to buy or own such movies.\n"}

Grendel Enterprises published and ran it exclusively on the Internet. The basis for \"Grendel’s Cave\" was Anglo-Saxon mythology and Beowulf, and it was set in the historical medieval period. Scholars considered it an artistic depiction of Grendel and the poem, Beowulf, as well as a modern adaptation and a derivative work of the epic. Educational websites use \"Grendel's Cave\" as an Internet learning aid for medieval literature and they considered it an online Beowulf resource.\n\n\"Grendel's Cave\" was an online Beowulf resource that goes beyond the written text by allowing players to participate in the story. Scholars consider it a modern adaptation of the original Beowulf poem. Glenco McGraw-Hill uses the site as part of their Study Guide for Beowulf. Educational websites use \"Grendel's Cave\" as an online reference for medieval literature.\n\nMars Software Products wrote the first version of \"Grendel's Cave\" in 1981 as a single-player video game for the SWTPC 6800 microcomputer. This version was a fully text-based game but included many of the features of the later Internet incarnations of the game. The developer based the game on an older pen and paper dungeon game with the same name. \nIn 1997, Grendel's Net took over the project and began development of an Internet version of the game. Grendel's Net conducted their development as an experiment in Classic ASP and Microsoft SQL 6.0 programming for the World Wide Web. They rolled out Version 1.0 in August 1998. This version ran until July 2001. Hacking and cheats plagued this version during the last year of its run, which finally brought about the demise of the game.\n\nIn early 2005, Grendel Enterprises acquired the rights to all of Grendel's Net assets. Grendel Enterprises' programmers found the original \"Grendel's Cave\" source code on an old database server in an office closet. Soon after, they started work on \"Grendel's Cave\" v2.0. They rolled out the first beta, v1.8A, on April 1, 2005 and over the next two years followed it up by four more pre-2.0 versions, 1.8B, 1.8C, 1.9, and 2.0 betas. Finally, on November 11, 2007, version 2.0 went live. Version 2.0 contained many aspects of the original \"Grendel's Cave\" with the addition of many Norse mythological elements and NPCs.\n\nThe game’s graphics have remained mostly unchanged throughout its history, giving it and old and outdated look.\n\nVersion 3.0 added text only and MUD style user interfaces, TTS-enabling the game. \n\nGrendel's Cave has effectively shut down. \n\nGameplay involves creating Thanes, the player characters in the game, killing monsters, primarily found in \"Grendel's Cave\", increasing value and stats and collecting items. Thanes obtain gold rings, the game's currency, by selling obtained items or Singing of Deeds before King Hrothgar. They gain magical abilities by visiting the Witch or through acquired items. Ultimately, this leads players to complete quests and earn amulets, by traveling to other worlds, and trading in those earned amulets for the Yggdrasil amulet and thus gaining the ability to kill Grendel. Killing Grendel is the ultimate objective of the game. After killing Grendel there is a secondary objective, killing Grendel's Mother, and then a tertiary objective, killing The Dragon.\n\nAt any one time there are many kingdoms running, with a Grendel in each kingdom that players can kill, of several different kingdom types. The different kingdom types range from beginner to advanced, with increasing difficulty and requirements for killing Grendel, occasionally tournament style or championship kingdoms and personal kingdoms that can be custom configured by individual players. The less advanced kingdoms are generally non-PVP, while the more advanced kingdoms allow PVP and player killing.\n\nKilling Grendel in any of the more advanced kingdoms earns the player's Thane a place on the hall of fame. To date 202 Thanes have earned a spot on the hall of fame.\n\nThe basis for \"Grendel's Cave\" is the Anglo-Saxon poem, Beowulf. It is set in King Hrothgar's, king of the Danes, kingdom in the early 6th century. The kingdom is in the middle of its war with Grendel. Grendel is an AI monster, who performs many tasks, most of them nasty, involving killing or harassing Thanes in the game. It contains many Norse mythology elements but also contains anachronistic elements as well as many references to historical events and items and popular culture. It encompasses Norse cosmology, with each of the nine worlds represented in the game. Player's Thanes can travel to these worlds and complete quests. Thanes can take on other than human characteristics, including Valkyrie, Berserkers, Tricksters, and Shape-Shifters, among others.\n"}
{"id": "24298971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24298971", "title": "Horia Gârbea", "text": "Horia Gârbea\n\nHoria-Răzvan Gârbea or Gîrbea (; born August 10, 1962) is a Romanian playwright, poet, essayist, novelist and critic, also known as an academic, engineer and journalist. Known for his work in experimental theater and his Postmodernist contributions to Romanian literature, he is a member of the Writers' Union of Romania (USR), its public relations executive and the head of its Bucharest chapter. Also recognized for his contribution to Romanian humor and his essays, he has published regularly in journals such as \"Contemporanul\", \"Luceafărul\", \"Ramuri\" and \"Săptămâna Financiară\". His career in the media also covers screenwriting for Romanian television stations and the popularization of contract bridge. The author of several scientific works on engineering, Gârbea is also a faculty member at the University of Agronomical Sciences and Veterinary Medicine.\n\nThe recipient of several national awards for literature, he received critical attention for plays, short stories and novels which merge intertextuality and parody with neorealistic elements. In his work for the Romanian stage, Gârbea has primarily reworked motifs from Anton Chekhov, Ion Luca Caragiale, Gustave Flaubert, Costache Negruzzi and various other of his predecessors, addressing contemporary realities. He is also the other of tragicomedies with themes borrowed the 1989 Revolution and his country's post-1989 history. The latter focus is complemented by his works in novel and short prose, which often take the form of political fiction or satire aimed at his writer colleagues. Such contributions have consolidated Gârbea's success with the general public, but have divided critical opinion on the issue of their ultimate literary value.\n\nBorn in Bucharest, Horia Gârbea is the grandson of Titus Gârbea, a Land Forces general and diplomat of the Romanian Kingdom. He recalls that his grandfather's passion for literature was passed onto him from an early age, when he first heard him reciting poems by Dante Aligheri. The future writer attended the Mihai Viteazul High School, opting for a sciences-based curriculum, but envisioned becoming a writer. At around age 17, as one of the adolescent guests on a Romanian Television talk show hosted by author Mircea Sîntimbreanu, he stated his intention of having two books published by the year 2000 (he recalls: \"[Sîntimbreanu], who was a witty but skeptical man, did not encourage me\").\n\nGârbea made his debut in 1982, at age twenty, his poems being published by the student magazine \"Amfiteatru\". He graduated from the Agronomical Science University's Department of Landscaping and Environmental Engineering (1986). A member of the teaching staff at his \"alma mater\" since 1987, he received a Doctor of Science diploma from the Politehnica University in 1999. A regular of \"Cenaclul de luni\" (\"The Monday Literary Club\"), founded by literary critic Nicolae Manolescu and journalist Radu Călin Cristea, Gârbea later moved on to the \"Universitas\" circle, founded and led by critic Mircea Martin. His early poetry was awarded a 1986 prize by Spain's University of Bilbao (1986).\n\nA turning point in Horia Gârbea's writing career was the Romanian Revolution of 1989, which put an end to the communist regime. In 1990, one of his first works in drama, translated into English as \"The Serpent\", was performed by the British Royal Court Theatre. A year later, \"Pescăruşul din livada cu vişini\" (\"The Seagull in the Cherry Orchard\") was first staged at the Victor Ion Popa Theater, followed in 1992 by the premiere of \"Funcţionarul destinului\" (\"The Clerk of Destiny\") with the Bucharest experimental theater company Inoportun. He made his editorial debut in the genre with the 1993 volumes \"Doamna Bovary sînt ceilalţi\" (\"Madame Bovary Are the Others\") and \"Mephisto\" (a Romanian-language variant of Klaus Mann's 1936 novel). Another one of his plays, \"Stăpânul tăcerii\" (\"The Master of Silence\"), was staged in 1994 by Piteşti's Alexandru Davila Theater.\n\nGârbea's first volume of lyric poetry, (\"Biographical Text\"), saw print in 1996, earning him an award granted by the Sighet Poetry Festival. Also that year, the writer followed up with a second collection of poems, \"Proba cu martori\" (\"The Confrontation of Witnesses\"), which was awarded the yearly prize of the Bucharest Association of Writers (a section of the USR). In 1996, he wrote the script for \"Ils emménagement\" (\"They Are Moving On\"), a French-language street theater performance, which premiered in France. \"Proba cu martori\" was followed in 1997 by the short story volume \"Misterele Bucureştilor\" (\"The Mysteries of Bucharest\") and the multiple award-winning novel \"Căderea Bastiliei\" (Romanian for \"Fall of the Bastille\").\n\nGârbea returned to drama with the 1999 book \"Decembrie, în direct\" (\"December, Live Broadcast\"). It received the Writers' Union Prize for Theater. The student theater company Calandrinon featured his \"Cărţile\" (\"The Books\") in its 2000 program, and the Toma Caragiu Theater in Ploieşti did the same with \"Cafeaua domnului Ministru\" (\"The Minister's Coffee\"). In 2001, he published an anthology of texts for the stage: titled \"Cine l-a ucis pe Marx?\" (\"Who Killed Marx?\"), it was a recipient of the Romanian Academy's Ion Luca Caragiale Award with a three-year delay. Also in 2001, his short story collection (\"Enigmas in Our City\") saw print. These were followed the next year by \"Raţă cu portocale\" (\"Duck à l'Orange\"), a volume of essays, and, in 2003, by two other books: \"Vacanţă în infern\" (\"A Holiday in Hell\"; literary criticism, 2 vols.) and \"Creşterea iguanelor de casă\" (\"Raising Pet Iguanas\"; poetry). The former was shortlisted for the USR Award.\n\nHis career in the post-Revolution press began early in 1990, when he was among the writers published by \"Nouăzeci\", a magazine founded by Laurenţiu Ulici, Cristian Popescu and Cătălin Ţârlea. Active as a theater critic and chronicler, as well as a contract bridge popularizer, he later had permanent columns in \"Luceafărul\" (1990–1995, and again 1998-2001), \"ArtPanorama\" (1997–1998), \"Scena\" (1998–2001), \"Monitorul de Iaşi\" (1998–1999), \"Contemporanul\" (1999–2001), \"Săptămâna Financiară\" (after 2005) and the Craiova-based literary magazine \"Ramuri\". His articles were also published by other venues, among them \"Convorbiri Literare\", \"Cuvântul\", \"România Literară\" and \"Ziarul Financiar\". In 2001, he joined the editorial staff of \"Okean\", a specialized magazine co-founded by three Romanian theater companies: Bulandra, Nottara, Odeon and the National Theater Cluj-Napoca. He was also among the first Romanian authors to publish fiction in the new wave of lifestyle magazines, being an early contributor to the local version of \"Playboy\" (together with George Cuşnarencu, Răzvan Petrescu and Jean Lorin Sterian). Between 2002 and 2003, he published several works related to his field of expertise in engineering: \"Structuri şi construcţii cu izolatori dinamici\" (\"Structures and Constructions with Dynamic Insulation\", 2002), \"Structuri şi construcţii – noţiuni şi calcule de fiabilitate\" (\"Structures and Constructions—Notions and Calculations in Reliability\", 2002), \"Structuri şi construcţii – curs universitar\" (\"Structures and Constructions—University Lecture\", 2003; revised edition 2004).\n\nAn active member of the Writers' Union since 1994, Horia Gârbea was elected president of its Bucharest chapter in 2003, and appointed head of the Union's public relations branch two years later. As a representative of the Bucharest section, he worked closely with Editura Nouă publishing house in helping to popularize the writings of his fellow association members. Having joined the UNITER association of theatrical professionals in 1993, he also works as a dramaturge, and has first been employed as such by the Toma Caragiu Theater since 1998. His contributions in this field include translations and adaptations of plays by Anton Chekhov (\"The Cherry Orchard\"), Pierre Corneille (\"L'Illusion comique\"), Dario Fo (\"We Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!\"), Pierre de Marivaux (\"Le Triomphe de l'amour\"), Molière (\"The School for Wives\"), Ayn Rand (\"Night of January 16th\"), Fernando Arrabal, Jacques Copi, Eugène Ionesco, John D. MacDonald, Niccolò Machiavelli, Gérald Sibleyras, Tennessee Williams and Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz. In 1998, Gârbea also began working in screenwriting, collaborating with several national television stations. He was first employed by Pro TV from 1998 to 2001, working on the variety show \"Ministerul comediei\" and the sitcom \"La Bloc\". He was then affiliated with Prima TV, writing for Romică Ţociu and Cornel Palade's \"Alomania\" sketch comedy show, and later Naţional TV, where he contributed to a similar production, \"Naţionala de bere\". In 2001, Gârbea was also involved in writing for Antena 1's sitcom \"Clanul Popeştilor\". Between 2002 and 2003, he worked with the public broadcaster TVR Cultural, where he hosted a talk show on cultural issues.\n\nDuring 2004, authors Horia Gârbea, Valeriu Butulescu, Mircea Ghiţulescu and Mircea Petean traveled to Vietnam, on the invitation of the Vietnamese Writers Union. Their experience in the Far East produced the collective travel account \"Drumul spre Nghe An\" (\"The Road to Nghe An\"), published the same year. Also in 2004, Gârbea premiered his \"Cleopatra a şaptea\" (\"Cleopatra VII\") with the Andrei Mureşanu company of Sfântu Gheorghe, published a new work for the stage—\"Hotel Cervantes\", and oversaw the publishing of Editura Limes' \"Repetiţie fără orchestră\" (\"Rehearsal without an Orchestra\"), an anthology of prose pieces by young Romanian authors. His own work also included the 2005 essay collections \"Arte parţiale\" (\"Partial Arts\") and \"Bridge în 41 de povestiri vesele\" (\"Contract Bridge in 41 Cheerful Stories\"). Gârbea was made Knight of \"Meritul Cultural\" order through a 2004 presidential decree. In March 2005, as head of the Bucharest Association of Writers, he set up the Romanian version of France's literary festival \"Le Printemps des Poètes\" (\"Poets' Spring\", known locally as \"Primăvara poeţilor\"). A month later, during the \"Romanian Comedy Festival\", his play \"Leonida XXI\" was staged by the Comedy Theater.\n\nAlso in 2005, Gârbea and the Writers' Union were involved in a polemic with Paul Goma, a novelist and former dissident who lives in France. This came after \"Viaţa Românească\", a literary magazine managed by the Union, republished fragments from Goma's diary, which caused public outrage for its perceived antisemitism. Gârbea and USR president Nicolae Manolescu both intervened to sanction the publication. In an early interview with \"Gardianul\" daily, he spoke of the editorial staff as having displayed \"negligence\", and noted that replacing the panel of editors was one of the sanctions being considered, while also stating that he felt none of them were \"100% responsible\" for the incident. Gârbea however dismissed rumors that he and his colleagues were considering disestablishing \"Viaţa Românească\", noting that the magazine was a historical institution.\n\nThe USR's public expression of regret over having tolerated \"a text with antisemitic content\" caused Goma to threaten with a lawsuit on libel grounds. In reaction, Gârbea stated: \"What we are interested in is \"Viaţa Românească\", a press organ edited by the USR. Paul Goma may believe whatever he likes. It is not him that we are discussing, but the magazine. I see no reason why he would sue me personally.\" According to an overview of the episode by journalist Ovidiu Şimonca, Horia Gârbea had unwittingly prompted Goma to state his intention of suing the Jewish-Romanian community league, or Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania (FCER). This was because, during the scandal, Gârbea had explained that the FCER's reaction was an incentive in the USR's internal investigation. Goma's claim for reparations from FCER leaders, Şimonca noted, ignored the fact that Gârbea had not disclosed any names.\n\nGârbea published his second novel, \"Crime la Elsinore\" (\"Murders at Helsingør\"), in 2006. Printed the same year, his new drama volume, \"Divorţ în direct\" (\"Live Divorce\"), was nominated for another USR award. In late 2007, he participated with fellow writers Doina Ruşti and Liviu Ioan Stoiciu in a children's literature project initiated by Editura Paralela 45, which involved rewriting a series of fairy tales in Romanian folklore and Christian mythology. Titled \"Basme şi poveşti mistice româneşti repovestite\" (\"Retold Romanian Fairy Tales and Mystical Stories\"), it was illustrated with reproductions of children-made Romanian icons. His son, Tudor, was born in the same year.\n\nWith the 2008 \"Trecute vieţi de fanţi şi de birlici\" (\"Bygone Lives of Beaus and Aces\"), he investigated the history of Romanian literature by focusing on and inventorying literary types. In spring, he participated in the project \"Scriitori pe calea regală\" (\"Writers on the Royal Road\"), organized by the former King of Romania Michael I, the Royal House, the USR and various other venues for the benefit of award-winning writers. He was also the USR's envoy to the Three Seas Writers and Translators Committee conference on Rhodes, Greece.\n\nThe same year, Gârbea voluntarily reduced his contributions to drama and theater criticism, citing his family obligations, alongside a general disappointment with the milieu: \"I grew aware that writing for the theater is usually not followed by productions. Although plays I signed were constantly performed, I never had productions at a satisfactory level nor significant material gains, except for translations.\" Instead, he focused on writing a fantasy novel for the youth, \"Făt Frumos din lună\" (\"\"Făt Frumos\" from the Moon\") and a cycle of poems known as \"Cântecele lui Huppy\" (\"Huppy's Songs\"), as well as on reviewing for publishing the memoirs of his grandfather Titus Gârbea. Working with Editura Tritonic publishing house, Gârbea also coordinated an anthology of political fiction, in which he included his own novella \"Detestarea naţiunii\" (\"Detesting the Nation\").\n\nIn 2010, Editura Limes published \"Fratele mai deştept al lui Kalaşnikov\" (\"Kalashnikov's Smarter Brother\"), his new volume of short prose. The same year, Gârbea visited Azerbaijan, invited by the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, and published some of his impressions in \"Revista 22\". His larger travel writing, published by the same foundation as \"Azerbaijan - The Living Flame\" (in English, Romanian, German), was officially launched at the Frankfurt Book Fair (October 2010). In April 2011, Gârbea and fellow writer Ruxandra Cesereanu were in Israel, attending the Nisan Poetry Festival in Maghar.\n\nCommitted to Postmodernism, Gârbea debuted as a member of the \"Optzecişti\" group of writers, most of whom reached their creative peak after 1980: together with Mircea Cărtărescu, Traian T. Coşovei, Florin Iaru, Doru Mareş, Radu G. Ţeposu and Ion Stratan, he was part of the \"Optzecişti\" nucleus inside \"Cenaclul de luni\". Given his relatively late consecration, Gârbea is nevertheless identified with the 1990s generation of post-\"Optzecişti\". This also reflects Gârbea's own positioning: according to his own statement, the move from one generation group to the other coincided with his leaving \"Cenaclul de luni\" and joining \"Universitas\". In 2008, he expressed much criticism for \"Orbitor\", a large-scale novelistic cycle by the \"Optzecişti\" group leader Cărtărescu. In her critical overview of Gârbea's contributions, \"Observator Cultural\" chronicler Bianca Burţa-Cernat describes him as one among the lesser authors of the 1990s generation, alongside Dan-Silviu Boerescu and Mihail Gălăţanu. Writing for the 2007 Columbia University \"Encyclopedia of Modern Drama\", Romanian-born Israeli actor-director Moshe Yassur included Gârbea \"among the best known\" of post-1989 playwrights \"experimenting with post-absurd-surrealist modes of expression.\" Others in this group are, according to his definition, Radu Macrinici, Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, Alina Nelega, Saviana Stănescu, Matei Vişniec and Vlad Zografi. In a 2001 overview of the generation's contribution, Nelega herself mentioned Gârbea and the others alongside Valentin Nicolau and Răzvan Petrescu.\n\nA defining characteristic of Gârbea's main works is the reliance on intertextuality, as compliments to his predecessors in drama, novel and poetry. Speaking in 2009, Gârbea himself recalled his stylistic discovery of the 1980s: \"It still seemed to me that being a writer meant having visions and struggling to communicate them so that others may have them too. [...] I could not write prose, but I enjoyed writing drama because I had invented something very fun to do: old characters in new situations.\" Poet and critic Octavian Soviany noted: \"Horia Gârbea is a dramatist who builds with a program in mind, placing his stake on the resources of parody and the intertextual play. The parodic here is given birth by the disabused conscience of a postmodern spirit, who knows that all books have been written and therefore only their 'rewriting' [...] is still possible\". Commenting on the texts grouped within \"Cine l-a ucis pe Marx?\", literary critic Mircea A. Diaconu placed the intertextual references (which often make a point of transgressing historical reality) in connection with William Shakespeare's phrase \"All the world's a stage\", since \"everything is possible at the level of the text becoming reality\". He praises the author for managing to preserve an \"absence that imposes\", by not making his own intervention felt in the text. Diaconu admits that such an approach could be read as \"gratuitously bookish, [where] a line is more important than an event, a pun more important than a murder\", but supports the notion that they all display an \"existential bearing\", accounting for an \"intrinsic value.\" He speaks of the technique as \"a vengeance of the theater\" on the traditional historical record: \"In essence, Horia Gârbea's theater emerges from the textual inconsistency of the world when faced with the consistency of history, or, better yet, from the inconsistency of history and the textual consistency of the world.\"\n\nBeyond its immediate context, critics see Horia Gârbea's contribution as greatly indebted to the work of 19th century dramatist and humorist Ion Luca Caragiale. According to Diaconu, Caragiale's influence constitutes the \"depth\" of Gârbea's work, going beyond the \"surface level\" of intertextual references and tributes. At the same core level, Diaconu identifies the author's debt to Eugène Ionesco, while also judging his manner of \"mixing eras, languages, writings, characters or historical figures, fiction and document\" to echo the techniques of Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges. Another main influence on Gârbea's work is interwar author Mateiu Caragiale, made famous by his cultivated style and eccentric outlook. Critic Dumitru Ungureanu sees this cultural echo as having been filtered by the style of Radu Albala, one of the authors to have been most inspired by the \"matein\" narratives, and concludes that the lineage places Gârbea on the same level as Cărtărescu and Florin Şlapac.\n\nAccording to his generation colleague, essayist Dan-Silviu Boerescu, Gârbea \"cannot part with the speculative charm of a brain given to bookish games\", but closely follows a realistic tradition with his \"sarcastic analysis of [...] all everyday weakness.\" For Boerescu, Gârbea's literature is supported by his sarcasm and his contribution to Romanian humor: \"Thin and edgy like a razor, Gârbea's style forgives no one no thing.\" Soviany also argues that the \"rewriting\" of texts attempted by the Romanian author is carried by \"absurd humor\" and \"the most unusual (as well as the most hilarious) arrangements of famous characters and quotes\". Poet and critic Paul Aretzu writes: \"The staple of [Horia Gârbea's] writing is inventive, farcical, the obvious attribute of intelligence and refinement, also displaying bookish support and being enhanced by zestful language. [...] The tendency of visualizing, of sketching portraits, of detailing/dissecting scenes, of verifying orality, the expressive value of the language, reveal the author's dominant structure as a playwright.\" The alternation of such stylistic traits reflects in part the writer's own parting with the \"Optzecişti\". The focus on everyday issues prompted Cătălin Ţârlea to view Gârbea's 1990s prose as a revival of neorealism after the \"Optzecişti\" experimentalism. Boerescu however believes this verdict to be \"only half right\", since the writer continued to employ experimental devices long after 1989, while avoiding the \"referential ostentation\" of other writers. Appreciation of Gârbea's work was also expressed among older critics and Gârbea's own mentors. Nicolae Manolescu held Gârbea's contribution in high esteem, an, in his 2008 synthesis of Romanian literary history, spoke of him as having \"indisputably, the fabric of a dramatist\".\n\nIn Nelega's view, Gârbea, \"one of the truly alive writers of his time\", was among the few debuting local playwrights to have their works staged by prominent Romanian directors—Alexandru Darie, Alexandru Hausvater and Gavril Pinte. Gârbea's fellow \"România Literară\" contributor, literary historian Alex. Ştefănescu, contrasted his writings with the \"boring\" works by some of his contemporaries, and claimed that \"directors and actors take pleasure in staging [Gârbea's plays].\" Gârbea's work stands out within its cultural and temporal context for its size and diversity. Aretzu sees him as \"one of the most ubiquitous authors in present-day literature, [...] gifted with a great availability in processing reality\", while critic and academic Nicolae Oprea believes him to be \"the most prolific\" among the Bucharest-based group formed in the 1990s. Literary reviewer Daniel Cristea-Enache also describes his colleague as \"multilateral\" who \"can adapt himself with great ease to any particular genre's specificity\". Writing in 2007, Ştefănescu defined him a \"one-man orchestra [...] of the apathetic (and sometimes shy-brazen) Romanian literature of today.\" According to Moldovan writer Emilian Galaicu-Păun: \"As productive as an entire literary school [...], Horia Gârbea is a veritable Stakhanovite of writing, who has dealt in all genres and species\". Gârbea is also among the post-1990 Romanian authors to have received recognition abroad. In addition to the performances of \"The Serpent\" and \"Il émmagement\", Gârbea's \"Raţă cu portocale\" has been translated into German by Veronika Dreichlinger (\"Ente mit Apfelsine\", published in 2005). His work was also included into English-, French-, German-, Russian- and Serbian-language anthologies.\n\nThere are several controversial aspects to Gârbea's public notoriety, involving reactions against academic verdicts, and objecting to the close relationship between Gârbea and mainstream cultural forums such as the USR. The implications of positive appraisals by these venues were debated by literary critic Bogdan Creţu, who argued that Nicolae Manolescu tended to overrate authors in his proximity, while being dismissive of Vişniec's contribution to drama (which Manolescu had claimed lacked originality). Critic Dan C. Mihăilescu criticized in particular Manolescu's \"caprices\", suggesting that, in a 2008 synthesis of Romanian literary history, his older colleague had assigned Gârbea's entry undeserved space, more than to a better known novelist like Gib Mihăescu. Also according to Mihăilescu, Cărtărescu may have had his rival Gârbea in mind when reproaching Manolescu that he had insisted on writers who were not at all worthy of recognition. Nicolae Oprea saw Gârbea as apparently \"uninhibited\" in matters of literary discourse, but critically noted that the poet was also preoccupied, \"to the point of obsession\", with his own cultural imprint (citing as proof the fact that, in its original version, \"Creşterea iguanelor de casă\" features the English-language versions of five poems, translated by Gârbea's own hand). A highly critical voice is that of Bianca Burţa-Cernat. She suggests that, in adopting all forms of writing, Gârbea displays \"an implausible self-certainty\". She polemically connects the critical appreciation with his status as a \"good colleague\" and \"devoted shadow\" of other writers, noting that Gârbea's notoriety is ensured by a promotional system with \"all the stakes\" and \"all the pulleys\", as well as by \"the argument of prolificity\", but that these attributes also surpass his actual value.\n\nUsually assigned by their author the name of \"texts\", in preference over \"plays\", several among Gârbea's earliest works for the stage are Postmodern reworkings of classical motifs, fashioned into new statements about the limits of literature. His \"Pescăruşul din livada cu vişini\" is a personal take on Anton Chekhov's \"Cherry Orchard\" and \"Seagull\". According to the author's own assessment, the text fits in with a Chekhovian homage trend among Romanian dramatists, also including Iosif Naghiu's (\"Chekhov the Armorer\") and Vişniec's \"La machine Tchekhov\" (\"The Chekhov Machine\"). Soviany singles out the text as an answer to claims that parody is always inferior to its models, by identifying its original motifs in a new statement about theater itself: \"[the play], which is without doubt ascribable to the formula of 'apocalyptic' theater, draws its substance from mixing intertextual parody with an eschatologic vision, suggesting the regression (of world and literature) into the primordial mud. Putting to use [...] the deluge myth, the dramatist this time imagines an apocalypse of fiction (of the theater), during which the characters [...] are slowly being swallowed by the mud flows of subterranean waters, which could imply that literature (fiction) unavoidably secretes its own death, so that writing (being written) and dying end up being perfect synonyms.\" In this analogy between literature and death, Soviany argues, one finds \"the most profound message of Horia Gârbea's theater\". In \"Doamna Bovary sînt ceilalţi\", the theme and protagonists are borrowed from Gustave Flaubert's 1857 novel, reused by the author to make a statement about drama itself and combined with elements from Jean-Paul Sartre's \"No Exit\". In addition to such themes, Mircea A. Diaconu sees Gârbea's reflection on the conflict between history and fiction as personified by the lead character in \"Stăpânul tăcerii\": the Egyptian god Thoth, who bestows the gift of language on man, is depicted as \"the prototype of traitors.\"\n\nPublished ten years after the Romanian Revolution, \"Decembrie, în direct\" recounts a changing of roles between torturer and victim, set to the background of political turmoil. In the first part, it introduces the two protagonists: a failed boxer turned interrogator for the main communist repressive structure, the Securitate, who confronts his prisoner, a renegade nomenklatura member who has become a dissident. What is supposed to be an ordeal for the latter turns into a revelation for the former: the dissident is successful in assuring his interrogator that communism is doomed, and both flee the prison to partake in the victorious Revolution. The second part sees the dissident transformed into an agent for the reformed Intelligence Service, who displays no qualms about capturing, tormenting and finally killing his former associate. Historiographer and critic Ruxandra Cesereanu connects the outcome with a notoriously violent episode in Romania's communist history, the brainwashing experiment carried out by the Securitate in Piteşti prison: \"The paradox and moral-antimoral of Horia Gârbea's play is that the victim [...] proves himself tougher, more of an executioner, than his torturer. This means that the lines between victim and executioner are blurred and that, ultimately, the reeducation experiment in Piteşti prison (1949-1952), when victims were forced into becoming torturers, has succeeded. The antimoral in Gârbea's play is, however, all the more tough as the victim here becomes a torturer without being made to do so.\" Cesereanu ranks it and Radu Macrinici's \"T/Ţara mea\" (approx. \"My Dead Weight/Country\") among the post-1989 dramatic texts to have \"brought up [...] the Securitate issue, in a trenchant and even revelatory manner\". Gârbea's fellow playwright Alina Nelega notes that \"Decembrie, în direct\" is his first entirely original text for the stage, and rates it over intertextual texts from the same period.\n\nPublished alongside \"Decembrie, în direct\", \"Capul lui Moţoc\" (\"Moţoc's Head\") reinterprets \"Alexandru Lăpuşneanu\", a novella by the Romanian classic Costache Negruzzi, which romanticizes events in Moldavia's medieval history. Integrating further allusions to Romanian folklore (the \"Meşterul Manole\" myth), Shakespeare and various others, it is also seen by Alina Nelega as a close rendition of Ion Luca Caragiale's style. The protagonist, a treacherous Moldavian boyar by the name of Moţoc, uses a discourse rich in political imagery, and towards the end of the play reveals himself as an \"alter ego\" of communist theorist Karl Marx. Nelega is critical of the text, arguing that it \"does not surpass the gratuitousness of petty pokes\" and is \"more burlesque than absurd\", concluding: \"I fear that Gârbea did not know how to end his play and quickly fabricated, \"deus ex machina\", the similitude of a profound sense where there was nothing.\"\n\nThe three-character comedy and satire \"Cafeaua domnului Ministru\", seen by poet and literary chronicler Emil Mladin as one \"of morals\", turns its attention to Romania's political scene, showing the stormy encounter between a matron, a female secretary and a politician. The dialogues are seen by Mladin as \"a parody of the discourses with which just about any television station assassinates us\", and, Nelega writes, \"the lampoon has precise targets\". The story pokes fun at the Social Democratic Party and Romanian Democratic Convention governments of the post-1989 period, and, according to dramatist and theater critic Mihaela Michailov, was \"adequate\" in the context of 2000 elections. Michailov highlights the play's symbolism as illustrating \"the stupidity of the political mechanism\", whose sphere is turned into \"a sort of no man's land where everything is possible.\" According to Alex. Ştefănescu, productions of \"Cafeaua domnului Ministru\" receive as much applause as \"a rock music recital.\" With \"Leonida XXI\", the author returned to intertextual reworkings, this time introducing his style to the works of Ion Luca Caragiale, \"Conu Leonida faţă cu reacţiunea\" and \"O scrisoare pierdută\". The play was notably used as teaching material for student actors training at the Caragiale Academy under Mircea Albulescu, who called it \"extremely interesting\".\n\nWith his debut novel \"Căderea Bastiliei\", Gârbea produces a satirical portrayal of his fellow Romanian writers, disguising their real names with anagrams or other word play. Alex. Ştefănescu, who writes that such portrayals caused \"great agitation in the literary world\", cites the author's own mock-disclaimer: \"The identification of some characters with real person constitutes an abuse of interpretation which the author intends to fight off with any legal means.\" Ştefănescu however cautions against reading \"Căderea Bastiliei\" purely as a \"roman à clef\", since the inspiration from \"writers' deeds\" is \"capricious\" and the resemblance with real persons \"partial\". A similar opinion was voiced by poet and journalist Cornelia Maria Savu, who compared the narrator to a puppeteer and further assessed: \"Horia Gârbea does not hate his characters, does not love them, he understands them. And by understanding them, he offers them a few moments to evolve with no strings.\" Reviewing the work from a stylistic point of view, Paul Aretzu analyzes the intrusion of \"intertextual indulgences\" throughout the work, identifying allusions to Ion Luca Caragiale, Franz Kafka, Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voineşti and others, while also noting the presence of experimental methods echoing James Joyce's \"Ulysses\". Ştefănescu attributes such presences to parody, noting in passing the introduction of situations and even entire passages from Kafka's \"Metamorphosis\" and Albert Camus' \"The Plague\".\n\nThe narrative delves into Bucharest's bohemian environment, its heroes being vagrants, misfits or alcoholics who lead tragicomic lifestyles. The plot, deemed \"to die for\" by Galaicu-Păun, notably shows writer and former inmate Aldu Rădulescu seducing literary chronicler Alteea Fleciu, as revenge for a negative review of his work. In Paul Aretzu's view, the manner in which such developments are presented constitutes \"a continuous demonstration of brilliant intelligence and spectacular linguistic imagination.\" He commends a chapter of the book, which discusses how groups of people differentiated by their respective drinking cultures, for being \"a sort of poem dedicated to the kinds of drink and drunks in a small alcoholic town\", while noting that a similar section, dedicated to the attitudes of writers when faced with fatal diseases, \"creates, with the means of the grotesque, a \"sui generis\" mythology of the writers' caste\". The latter episode is praised by Ştefănescu for its \"irresistible\" black humor and its \"devilish verve\". The same commentator states: \"The novelist has a joy of writing that transmits itself to the reader. After you finish reading this novel about the ugliness of (literary) life [...], you feel, paradoxically, the joy of living, of communicating, of partaking in the captivating spectacle of being.\" In Artezu's account, those parts of \"Căderea Bastiliei\" in which Gârbea discusses the annual competition for literary prizes offer evidence both a \"captivating\" humorous focus on everyday occurrences and an \"innocent cynicism, characteristic for the author\". He argues: \"With all the signs of his emotional involvement [...], the author also exercises, through correlations [and] quotes, the function of depersonalization, of estrangement, of laughing at one's misfortunes, of projecting oneself into clichés, [...] of surrogate existence.\" Literary reviewer Cosmin Ciotloş issues a more reserved verdict on the text: in his view, the episodes of \"Căderea Bastiliei\" are primarily \"charades\", whose main quality is being \"droll\".\n\nOverall, Horia Gârbea's contribution to short fiction is described by Alex. Ştefănescu as \"ingenious\" and \"endearing\". The political fiction of is described by Boerescu as \"a multitude of sub-worlds\" structured around \"framework situations\", moving between the \"petty politics of the day\" (targeting the Social Democratic Party) and ironic parables or dystopias. Boerescu writes: \"The author cannot refrain from endlessly staging acts and short plays or inserting lines with an obvious dramatic hue\". The same commentator identifies in the stories several allusions, homages or intertextual borrowings, from the \"semiotic games\" of Umberto Eco to a \"landscape of luxuriant vegetation\" characteristic for the Latin American Boom writers. This symbolism is coupled with allusions to Romanian literary life: the final story in the collection, \"Motanii din bibliotecă\" (\"The Tomcats in the Study Hall\"), speculates about the future of Gârbea's generation, and depicts bibliophiles keeping pets named after the leading literary critics of the 1980s and '90s.\n\nAmong his poetry collections, \"Creşterea iguanelor de casă\" drew attention for transferring the intertextual and parodic conventions into a lyrical format, mostly free verse. According to Ştefănescu, it and his other poetry collections are \"better than those by most contemporary authors who emphatically recommend themselves as poets.\" Nicolae Oprea noted in particular the reworking of a motif borrowed from Sibiu Circle poet Ştefan Augustin Doinaş and his \"Mistreţul cu colţi de argint\": the \"prince from the Levant\", whom Gârbea transfers into the destitute world of garbage collectors. Part of it reads:\nOprea also highlighted ironic and dismissive borrowings from Romania's national poet Mihai Eminescu, and from poets laureate such as Octavian Goga and Vasile Alecsandri, as well as an actual lineage from the black humor of 1930s Surrealists. He sees a direct link between Gârbea and the Romanian Surrealist group's Gellu Naum, and beyond, to the \"existential\" absurdism of Ionesco and Kafka. Also according to Oprea, such texts \"are raised as collages of everyday images and bookish suggestions, well tied to each other, to the point where their articulation into colloquial speech puts to use the technique of reabsorbing the dramatic element and the narrative nucleus of balladesque nature into the sphere of pure lyricism.\"\n\n\"Crime la Elsinore\" is a return to prose satire, in this case directed at the theatrical environment. The setting is a fictional theater in provincial Călăraşi, deriving its name from the Getic ruler Dromichaetes, and the protagonists, Cosmin Ciotloş notes, are composite portrayals rather than the \"masked\" characters of \"Căderea Bastiliei\". He argues: \"Whichever way you look at it, set free from the contextual interpretations exercised in reading tabloids, the novel stands only to gain.\" The narrative focus is on the kitschy ambition of a failed theater manager, Cosma, who proceeds to conflate all the violent moments of Shakespearean tragedy into a single show of regular proportions. The project is increasingly confused, and the text used by Cosma mixes Shakespeare's lines with quotes from Pierre Beaumarchais, Euripides and Molière, while adopting the format of a detective novel.\n\nCiotloş reproached \"Crime la Elsinore\" for lack of subtlety, in the presence of a \"not exactly indispensable\" glossary of terms which was published with the book. Although he acknowledges that the writing is \"amusing\", he also contends that it is \"impossible to extend sociologically or connect to some reality\", being isolated \"in its own world\", and displaying \"compositional precariousness.\" He concludes: \"A book perfect in its own way, but far from perfection in ours.\" A similar overview is provided by Burţa-Cernat, who contends that, in taking sides and explaining his intentions, the author adopts \"the manner of an untalented journalist\", with \"see-through\" results. She also believes that Gârbea's chief comedic resource is \"the cheap anecdote with a trite climax\", which she compares with those published by the communist-era magazine \"Urzica\". Additionally, Burţa-Cernat comments on the irony of Cosma's reliance on intertextuality, which she finds similar to Gârbea's own work for the stage. Critic Andrei Terian noted that he disliked almost all the book, because of its author's tendency to humiliate his characters \"before us readers are in the least familiarized with them.\"\n\nIn \"Trecute vieţi de fanţi şi de birlici\", Gârbea revisits the main themes of Romanian literature, looking into the biographies of various fictional characters, their lifestyles, personal preferences and social positioning. He himself defined the overview as \"a sort of collection of essays on the edge of literary history.\" One of its chapters compares the tabletop games entertaining such figures, from the contract bridge parties in Camil Petrescu's books and the antiquated card games in Mateiu Caragiale's \"Craii de Curtea-Veche\" to the cruder craps and gambling preferred by thieves in Eugen Barbu's novels. Other sections discuss the attitudes toward love in such diverse places as Marin Sorescu's neorealist prose and the fantasy short stories of Mircea Eliade. Likewise, the avatars of violence are depicted between Ion Luca Caragiale's satire \"D-ale carnavalului\", where people threaten to poison each other with sulfuric acid, Anton Bacalbaşa's depictions of officers disciplining their subordinates with the use of belts, and Marin Preda's \"Moromeţii\", where peasants beat each other with clubs. Another part of the book deals with the incidence of failure among intellectual protagonists, and leads Gârbea to conclude that, with the exception of Mihail Sebastian's \"Accidentul\", Romanian narratives generally show their intellectual protagonists incapable of finding their way in life. According to Daniel Cristea-Enache, Gârbea generally and willingly limited the scope of his investigation to canonical and urbane literary realism, avoiding allegorical styles such as Onirism: \"the author is not interested in symbolic codification, in the refraction of the characters and their fictional world; but, quite the contrary, in the points and lines at which literature intersects with social life.\"\n\nIn his review of the volume, Emil Mladin deemed it \"wonderful\" and \"an extremely welcome project\", noting: \"\"Trecute vieţi de fanţi şi de birlici\" represents a link which the reader needed in his relationship with the characters of stories relevant both at the time of their writing and today.\" According to literary critic Silvia Dumitrache, the book creates \"new paths in interpretation [...] even when starting from literary locations that are often threatened with turning into clichés.\" She concludes \"Through the playful note he impresses on the book, Horia Gârbea proves that his main intention does not reside in the willingness to impose a new hermeneutic grid on Romanian literature, but in the attempt to demonstrate that the resources of literature can never, ever, be entirely exhausted.\" Cristea-Enache sees in \"Trecute vieţi de fanţi şi de birlici\" \"a book as interesting as it is enjoyable [...]. A holiday read, one could say, had this sytagm not been bastardized, in our country, by so many printed works (volumes and journals alike) that offend the reader's intellect.\"\n\nOutside the critical reevaluation of local literature, Gârbea's work includes short humorous essays about various topics in post-1989 society and modern Romanian culture. One such chapter is built around the polemic between Gârbea and writer Gheorghe Grigurcu, over the issue of what it means for a working artist to be treated unjustly or be privileged. Another fragment documents and ridicules the impact of instant messaging on the Romanian lexis, with the rapid spread of abbreviations such as \"sal\" (for \"salut\", \"hello\"), \"vb\" (\"vorbim\", \"we'll talk\") and \"ms\" (\"mersi\", \"thanks\"). Gârbea also pokes fun at the babytalk-based jargon of parenting magazines, and contrasts its apparent artificiality with the awe he records having personally experienced after the birth of his son Tudor. It reads: \"[He] does not inspire in me the image of fragility and fondness, but the force of an entity which benefits from the advantage of The Unknown. When I call him using his human name, he smiles down on me, with devastating irony, so that I may grasp my complete lack of fantasizing ability. No matter what will happen in the future, these winter days [...] shall always remain for me under the sign of having met, for the first time in life, an inexplicable creature.\"\n\n\"Fratele mai deştept al lui Kalaşnikov\", which comprises several stories, received mixed reviews. According to Andrei Terian, the main one, \"Articolul 96\" (\"Article 96\"), which is about a lecherous politician dating an anorexic model, has the same defects as \"Crime...\". In contrast, Terian notes, Gârbea shows his \"sure hand\" in other pieces, where he parodies \"Povestea unui om leneş\" (\"The Story of a Lazy Man\") by 19th century Romanian classic Ion Creangă, or where he pokes fun at the 14th century Battle of Rovine, as well as the absurdist \"Întoarcerea tatei din război. Subiecte\" (\"Father's Return from War. Subjects\"), where the same narrative cliché is explored from several conflicting perspectives. According to Terian, the volume as a whole displays influences from poet and satirist Tudor Arghezi, as well as borrowings from fellow parodist Ioan Groşan.\n\n\"Azerbaijan - The Living Flame\" details Gârbea's trip and offers additional insight into the Nagorno-Karabakh War and other conflicts between Azerbaijani people and Armenians. It features his poems about Shusha city, the Khojaly Massacre and the Guba mass grave. The texts received criticism from the Armenian Romanian community's \"Ararat\" journal: it specifically called \"disinformation\" the fragments which refer to Azerbaijan's Christian past, and expressed concern over Gârbea's claim that Heydar Aliyev was \"a civilizing providential hero\".\n\n"}

With a cast of one man, it was written for Northern Irish actor Patrick Magee and first titled \"Magee monologue\". (Patrick Magee is familiar to many moviegoers as the writer who Alex cripples while invading his home and raping his wife in \"A Clockwork Orange\".) It was inspired by Beckett's experience of listening\nto Magee reading extracts from \"Molloy\" and \"From an Abandoned Work\" on the BBC Third Programme in December 1957.\n\nThe play was first performed as a curtain raiser to \"Endgame\" (from 28 October to 29 November 1958) at the Royal Court Theatre, London, directed by Donald McWhinnie and starring Patrick Magee. It ran for 38 performances.\n\n\"Krapp's Last Tape\" premiered in North America at the Provincetown Playhouse, with the lead role played by Canadian actor Donald Davis, who won an Obie Award in 1960 for his performance in the play.\n\nIn a letter to a London bookseller Jake Schwartz on 15 March 1958, Beckett wrote that he had \"'four states, in typescript, with copious notes and dirty corrections, of a short stage monologue I have just written (in English) for Pat Magee. This was composed on the machine from a tangle of old notes, so I have not the MS to offer you.\"\n\nAccording to Ackerley and Gontarski, \"It was first published in \"Evergreen Review\" 2.5 (summer 1958), then in \"Krapp's Last Tape and Embers\" (Faber, 1959), and \"Krapp's Last Tape and Other Dramatic Pieces\" (Grove, 1960).\" Beckett’s own translation of the play into French, \"La Dernière Bande\", was published in \"Les Lettres Nouvelles\" on 4 March 1959.\n\nThe available printed texts must not be taken as definitive. \"By the mid-1950s Beckett was already talking and working like a director. In a letter to Rosset's editorial assistant, Judith Schmidt, on 11 May 1959, Beckett referred to the \"staging\" of \"Krapp's Last Tape\" as its 'creation',\" and he made numerous significant changes to the text over the years as he was involved in directing the play.\n\nThe first German performance, on 28 September 1959, was directed by Walter Henn at Berlin's \"Schillertheater\", where 10 years later, on 5 October 1969, Samuel Beckett himself staged his text in a most successful performance (with Martin Held as Krapp).\nThe first American performance, on 14 January 1960, was directed by Alan Schneider and starred Donald Davis.\n\nThe curtain rises on \"[a] late evening in the future.\" It is Krapp’s 69th birthday and he hauls out his old tape recorder, reviews one of the earlier years – the recording he made when he was 39 – and makes a new recording commenting on the last 12 months.\n\nKrapp is sitting in his den, lit by the white light above his desk. Black-and-white imagery continues throughout.\n\nOn his desk are a tape-recorder and a number of tins containing reels of recorded tape. He consults a ledger. The tape he is looking to review is the fifth tape in Box 3. He reads aloud from the ledger but it is obvious that words alone are not jogging his memory. He takes childish pleasure in saying the word ‘spool’.\n\nThe tape dates from when he turned 39. His taped voice is strong and rather self-important.\n\nThe voice mentions that he’s just celebrated his birthday alone \"at the wine house\" jotting down notes in preparation for the recording session later. His bowel trouble is still a problem and one obviously exacerbated by eating too many bananas. \"The new light above my table is a great improvement,\" reports the 39-year-old Krapp, before describing how much he enjoys leaving it, wandering off into the darkness, so that he can return to the zone of light which he identifies with his essential self. He notes how quiet the night is.\n\nThe voice reports that he has just reviewed an old tape from when he was in his late twenties. It amuses him to comment on his impressions of what he was like in his twenties and even the 69-year-old Krapp joins in the derisory laughter. The young man he was back then is described as idealistic, even unrealistic in his expectations. The 39-year-old Krapp looks back on the 20-odd-year-old Krapp with the same level of contempt as the 20-odd-year-old Krapp appears to have displayed for the young man he saw himself for in his late teens. Each can see clearly the fool he was but only time will reveal what kind of fool he has become.\n\nThe voice reviews his last year, when his mother died. He talks about sitting on a bench outside the nursing home waiting for the news that she had died. When the moment comes he is in the process of throwing a rubber ball to a dog. He ends up simply leaving the ball with the creature even though a part of him regrets not hanging onto it as some kind of memento. Krapp at 69 is more interested in his younger self's use of the rather archaic word \"viduity\" (Beckett had originally used \"widowhood\" in early drafts) than in the reaction of the voice on the tape to their mother's passing. He stops listening to look up the word in a large dictionary.\n\nHe returns to the tape. The voice starts to describe the revelation he experienced at the end of a pier. Krapp grows impatient and gets worked up when his younger self starts enthusing about this. He fast-forwards almost to the end of the tape to escape the onslaught of words. Suddenly the mood has changed and he finds himself in the middle of a description of a romantic liaison between himself and a woman in a punt. Krapp lets it play out and then rewinds the tape to hear the complete episode. Throughout it he remains transfixed and visibly relives the moment while it is retold.\n\nAfterwards, Krapp carefully removes this tape, locates a fresh one, loads it, checks the back of an envelope where he has made notes earlier, discards them and starts. He is scathing when it comes to his assessment of his thirty-nine-year-old self and is glad to see the back of him. He finds he has nothing he wants to record for posterity, save the fact he \"Revelled in the word \"spool\".\" But he does mention a trip to the park and attending Vespers, where he dozed off and fell off the pew. He also mentions his recent literary disappointments: \"seventeen copies sold\", presumably of his last book, eleven of which have gone not to interested readers but to foreign libraries; \"Getting known,\" he sarcastically summarises. His sex life has been reduced to periodic visits by an old prostitute recalling the jibes made in \"Eh Joe\": \"That slut that comes on Saturday, you pay her, don't you? ... Penny a hoist tuppence as long as you like.\"\n\nUnlike his younger selves, Krapp has nothing good to say about the man he has become and even the idea of making one \"last effort\" when it comes to his writing upsets him. He retreats into memories from his dim and distant past, gathering holly and walking the dog of a Sunday morning. He then remembers the girl on the punt, wrenches off the tape he has been recording, throws it away and replays the entire section again from the previous tape. It is a scene of masochism reminiscent of Croak in \"Words and Music\", tormenting himself with an image of a woman’s face. This time he allows the tape to play out. It ends with the thirty-nine-year-old Krapp determinedly not regretting the choices he has made, certain that what he would produce in the years to come would more than compensate him for any potential loss of happiness.\n\nKrapp makes no response to this but allows the tape to play on until the final curtain. \"Krapp’s spool of life is almost wound, and the silent tape is both the time it has left to run and the silence into which he must pass.\" Whereas the younger Krapp talks about the \"fire in me\" the tired old man who sits listening is simply \"burning to be gone.\" The title of the play seems obvious, that what we have witnessed is the recording of Krapp’s final tape, \"yet there is an ambiguity: 'last' can mean 'most recent' as well as 'ultimate'. The speaker in Browning's \"My Last Duchess\" is already planning to marry his next duchess ... Still, one hopes for Krapp's sake that he will be gone before another year is over.\"\n\nIn \"Waiting for Godot\", Beckett uses aspects of Judeo-Christianity as the template for his play, in \"Film\" the template is the writings of Bishop Berkeley, and in \"Krapp's Last Tape\", according to Anthony Cronin, he uses Manichaeism as a structural device: The dichotomy of light and dark ... is central to Manichaean doctrine ... Its adherents believed that the world was ruled by evil powers, against which the god of the whole of creation struggled as yet in vain ... Krapp is in violation of the three seals or prohibitions of Manichaeism for the elect: the seal of the hands, forbidding engagement in a profession, the seal of the breast against sexual desire, and the seal of the mouth, which forbids the drinking of wine ... Beckett [however] seems to have known no more about Manichaeism than is contained in the eleventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, which he possessed.\n\nAlthough there is only one person onstage, there are a number of 'characters' mentioned throughout. The play is considered to be Beckett at his most autobiographical, and it does draw heavily on biographical detail. He once told the scholar Lawrence Harvey, though, that his \"work does not depend on experience – [it is] not a record of experience. Of course you use it.\" Beckett takes elements from his own life, his failed love life, his drinking, his – at the time – literary failures and looks where things might have gone. \"When, in 1956, Vivian Mercier saw him in Paris, he told him that he felt 'all dried up, with nothing left but self-translation.'\"\n\nKrapp was originally designated simply ‘A’ in the first draft. The first appearance of a title was \"a manuscript edition to Typescript 2: \"Crapp’s Last Tape\"\"; the more familiar Germanic spelling came later. The name Krapp with its excremental connotations had been used before by Beckett however. In his first play, \"Eleutheria\", dating back to 1947, the protagonist is Victor Krap, a young man who has decided to retreat from life and do nothing. He has been described as a world-weary anti-hero, a failed writer and seedy solipsist, a clear prototype for the later Krapp.\n\nWhen the thirty-nine-year-old Krapp is talking about his neighbour's ritual singing in the evening he tries to remember if he sang as a boy and is unable to do so. He does recall attending Vespers but it would be unusual for him to attend Evensong without participating in the singing of the hymn. The sixty-nine-year-old Krapp sings a few lines from the \"Now the Day is Over\" in early performances of the play but Beckett excised this as being \"too clumsily explicit\".\n\nAlthough no time frame is given, it is likely that sixty-nine-year-old Krapp's memories of being \"again in the dingle at Christmas Eve, gathering holly ... [or] on Croghan on a Sunday morning, in the haze, with the bitch\" alludes to Beckett's own childhood familial memories.\n\nHis birth-sign in early drafts is given as Aries, Beckett's own. All we learn about Krapp at this age comes from the tape. Like a lot of young men he is full of \"aspirations\" – his work is starting to take shape – and \"resolutions\" – he is already aware that his drinking needs to be curbed. He is becoming resigned to the fact that he might well have let true love – represented by the image of a \"girl in a shabby green coat, on a railway-station platform\" – get away from him. He has settled for an on/off relationship with a \"Bianca\" but even there his future plans do not feature her. We learn that his problem with constipation has been ongoing since at least this time. He disparages his youth and is glad it is over. The thirty-nine-year-old Krapp estimates that the tape he had been listening to was made some ten or twelve years earlier. If it was twelve then he would have been twenty-seven at the time it was recorded.\n\n\"In the earlier drafts the woman with whom the young Krapp lived [later named \"Bianca\"] was first named 'Alba' (a character in \"Dream of Fair to Middling Women\" modelled on Ethna MacCarthy whom he had loved when he was a young man), then 'Celia' (the name of the green-eyed prostitute with whom Murphy cohabits in \"Murphy\"), then 'Furry' (nickname of Anne Rudmose-Brown, the wife of Beckett's French Professor at Trinity, who was himself satirised as 'the Polar Bear' in \"Dream of Fair to Middling Women\").\".\n\nHe settled on 'Bianca', who was most likely based on another lecturer, Bianca Esposito, who (along with Walter Starkie) taught him Italian and cultivated his lifelong passion for Dante. He took private lessons from Signorina Esposito as well. Those lessons at 21 Ely Place were then caricatured in the short story 'Dante and the Lobster'. Kedar Street is not a real location but an anagram of 'darke' or Hebrew for 'black'. Keeping this in mind, the name may simply have been selected because \"bianca\" means \"white woman\" in Italian. Little is recorded about her other than \"'a tribute to her eyes. Very warm.'\" Vivian Mercier, who knew Beckett personally, writes: \"Although I do not recall his ever using the phrase, Beckett unquestionably regards the eyes as the windows of the soul.\"\n\nKrapp’s father, the only other man mentioned in the play, is spoken of only very briefly. The expression \"Last illness\" suggests he has not been a well man for some time and dies while Krapp is in his twenties. His own father, William Beckett, died of a heart attack on 26 June 1933, when Beckett was twenty-seven.\n\nBeckett's first love, his cousin, Peggy Sinclair, had \"deep green eyes and [had a] passionate love of green clothing.\" An allusion to Peggy Sinclair also appears in \"Dream of Fair to Middling Women\" in Smeraldina, the \"little emerald\". Although the relationship is often cited as being a little one-sided, Beckett does recall: \"Oh, Peggy didn’t need any chasing.\"\n\nThis character does the majority of the talking throughout the play. His voice is contained on Tape 5 from Box 3. His voice is strong and rather pompous. He has celebrated his birthday alone in an empty wine house before returning home to consume three bananas. As has become his practice on his birthday he makes a tape looking back at who he was, assessing who he is and anticipating what might be to come. His is as disparaging of the young man he was in his twenties as he was then of the youth he had been thinking about when he made that earlier tape. He records the death of his mother, an epiphany at the end of a pier and an idyllic moment in a punt.\n\nThis character is based on Miss Beamish, an eccentric novelist from Connacht whom Beckett had met in Roussillon, while hiding during World War II. \"Whether the real Miss Beamish did actually sing regularly every evening is ... debatable. Beckett did not remember this.\"\n\nThere appears to be no direct correlation between this character and anyone living. The black-and-white imagery is strong here: her white uniform and the \"big black hooded perambulator.\" Krapp also remembers this woman’s eyes as being \"[l]ike ... chrysolite!\"\n\nRosemary Pountney observes Beckett changed \"moonstone\" to chrysolite, an olive-green coloured mineral, in Typescript 4.\n\nShe observes also that Beckett made \"a direct connection ... with \"Othello\", a play in which dark and light imagery is central,\" as \"in the margin of the text that he used for the 1973 London production,\" on page 15 where the word 'chrysolite' occurs ... he writes:\nIf heaven would make me such another world<br>\nOf one entire and perfect chrysolite<br>\nI’d not have sold her for it<br>\n\"Othello\" V2.\n\n\"Like Othello, too,\" Pountney continues, \"Krapp has lost his love through his own folly.\"\n\nBeckett’s mother, May, died on 25 August 1950 in the Merrion Nursing Home which overlooked Dublin’s Grand Canal. Beckett had made the trip over in the early summer to be with her. By 24 July medical opinion confirmed that she was dying. During that last long month he used \"to walk disconsolately alone along the towpath of the Grand Canal.\"\n\nTowards the end she was oblivious to his presence. Her death took place while he was sitting on a bench by the canal. \"At a certain point he happened to look up. The blinds of his mother’s window, a dirty red-brown affair, was down. She was dead.\" A drawn blind, an old custom signifying death, also makes an appearance in \"Rockaby\": \"let down the blind and down\".\n\nWhen Krapp’s mother died, he was throwing a ball for a little white dog. He says he will keep it forever: \"But I gave it away to the dog.\" Significantly the ball is black to contrast with the white of the dog. In \"All Strange Away\" a \"small grey punctured rubber ball\" is the last object contemplated before Fancy dies. The ball had already appeared in \"All That Fall\": Jerry returns \"a kind of ball\" to Mr. Rooney. Although not an obvious symbol of death, this ball is a significant motif of childhood grief for Beckett though none of his biographers propose that the presence of the dog is anything more than artistic license.\n\nBeckett makes the relationship of this woman to Krapp clear when \"[i]n 1975, directing Pierre Chabert in Paris, Beckett said: 'I thought of writing a play on the opposite situation, with \"Mrs Krapp, the girl in the punt\", nagging away behind him, in which case his failure and his solitude would be exactly the same.'\" In her biography of Beckett, Deirdre Bair deduces that \"the girl in the punt\" may be Peggy Sinclair because of the references to \"Effi\" and to \"the Baltic\": in July 1929 Beckett vacationed with the Sinclairs \"in one of the smaller resort towns along the Baltic Sea. Summer, traditionally the time for light reading, found Peggy tearfully engrossed in Theodor Fontane's novel, \"Effi Briest\". Beckett read it too, but with more detachment than Peggy, who wept and suffered as Effi's infidelity ended her marriage.\" Talking to James Knowlson, a few days before his death, Beckett said that he \"did not remember the scene this way, however, denying that girl in the boat ... had anything at all to do with his cousin, Peggy.\" Knowlson feels \"that there is little doubt the source for the girl with the haunting eyes is Ethna MacCarthy. For, as \"Dream of Fair to Middling Women\" had made clear ... the 'Alba', who, on Beckett’s own admission, was closely modelled on Ethna, had eyes like dark, deep pools.\" Beckett left no doubt however when he told Jean Martin, whilst rehearsing the play in 1970, that the girl was modelled on Ethna. On 11 December 1957 Beckett learned that Ethna was terminally ill and regularly wrote uncharacteristically long letters until her death. When he completed the play he wrote her: \"I’ve written in English a stage monologue for Pat Magee which I think you will like if no one else.\"\n\nAt one point in the recollection, the young Krapp leans over the young woman to shade her from the sun. \"Let me in,\" he says. This caused the Lord Chamberlain some concerns when the play was first presented before him to grant a license. He believed that what was being suggested was a desire for sexual penetration and was not convinced that Beckett was simply alluding to her eyes. It was not until a mere three weeks before the play's opening that the objection was dropped. In 1982 Beckett, in response to a similar suggestion from one of James Knowlson's postgraduate students, \"said with a chuckle, 'Tell her to read her texts more carefully. She'll see that Krapp would need to have a penis at an angle of a hundred and eighty degrees to make coitus possible in the position he is in!'\"––a position that Rosette Lamont proposes also \"suggests that of a suckling babe.\"\n\n\nBeckett would not be 69 until 1975 so, from his perspective, with Krapp a proxy for him, the action is set in the future. The first line of the play explicitly sets it 'in the future', although nothing onstage reveals this. Beckett wrote this play shortly before he turned 52 years old. As it happens, with \"Waiting for Godot\", success had found him but, at 39, the future must have seemed a lot bleaker for the writer, the Second World War was ending and all Beckett had had published were a few poems, a collection of short stories and the novel, \"Murphy\". Beckett had this to say about the drained old man we see onstage: \"Krapp sees very clearly that he’s through with his work, with love and religion.\" He told Rick Cluchey, whom he directed in 1977, that Krapp was \"in no way senile [but has] something frozen about him [and is] filled up to his teeth with bitterness.\" \"Habit, the great deadener\" has proven more tenacious than inspiration. His \"present concerns revolve around the gratification of those very bodily appetites that, earlier, he had resolved should be out of his life. Eating bananas and drinking have become a [daily routine]. Of the physical activities that he once considered excesses only sex has come to play a reduced part in his lonely existence\" in the form of periodic visits from an old prostitute.\n\nAlthough this is a play about memory, the sixty-nine-year-old Krapp himself remembers very little. Virtually all the recollections come from the tape. As evidenced most clearly in the novel \"Murphy\", Beckett had a decent understanding of a variety of mental illnesses including Korsakoff's Alcoholic Syndrome––\"A hypomaniac teaching slosh to a Korsakow's syndrome.\"––which is characterised by powerful amnesic symptoms accompanied by intestinal obstruction.\n\nIn his focus on chronic alcohol consumption, Narinder Kapur explains in \"Memory Disorders in Clinical Practice\" that it can lead to marked memory loss and generalised cognitive defects, as well as \"disorientation for time and also place\". More recent memories are likely to be forgotten than remote memories, for \"memory loss shows a temporal gradient with greater sparing of items from earlier years.\" Krapp's gathering of red-berried holly in the dingle could be an example of the \"relatively intact remote memory\" that preceded Krapp's apparent addiction to alcohol.\n\nKrapp is not a textbook case. He is an individual with his own individual symptomology but he is more than a list of symptoms. Bananas contain pectin, a soluble fibre that can help normalise movement through the digestive tract and ease constipation. Bananas can also aggravate constipation especially in young children. It depends what the root cause of the problem is. They are also high in Vitamins A and C as well as niacin, riboflavin and thiamine and one of the root causes of Korsakoff's Syndrome is thiamine deficiency; eating bananas would be good for him. It is easy to get caught up in this kind of over-analysis to the detriment of the play as a whole. \"[A]ttempts to demonstrate that Beckett's characters conform to specific psychological syndromes so often turn into will-o-the-wisp pursuits. Certainly, Beckett would not deny that psychologists have offered very useful descriptions of mental activity. But their theories are typically no more than initial steps in an understanding of mental processes, fragmented bits of knowledge which should not be taken for universal principles.\" It is important to remember that Krapp has not simply forgotten his past but he has consciously and systematically rejected it as one way of reassuring himself that he has made the right decisions in \"his yearly word letting.\"\n\nIn the past year Krapp has been re-reading Fontane's \"Effi Briest\", \"a page a day, with tears again,\" he says, \"Could have been happy with her, up there on the Baltic...\" Existing only on the printed page this fantasy woman is perhaps the most black-and-white of all Krapp’s women. Like the girl in the punt and the nursemaid mentioned earlier, perhaps to contrast with his inner fire, \"Once again Beckett situates Krapp's memory on some side near the water.\"\n\nJust as Krapp’s name is a vulgar pun, so is the name Beckett gave to the woman who visits him from time to time, whom he describes as a \"bony old ghost of a whore.\" As Fanny is an \"old ghost,\" all Krapp's women are figuratively \"ghosts, really, dependent for their existence on Krapp's bitter-sweet recording of them,\" according to Katherine Worth.\n\n\"Fanny\" is a slang British expression for the female genitals – woman reduced to a function. \"Fanny\" is also a commonly used diminutive of Frances, and Beckett occasionally referred to his aunt, Frances \"Cissie\" Sinclair, as \"Fanny.\"\n\nKrapp refers to her visits as \"better than a kick in the crutch.\" In the 1985 television version, Beckett changed this phrase to \"better than the finger and the thumb,\" an unambiguous reference to masturbation that would never have escaped the British Lord Chamberlain in the fifties.\n\nIn an earlier draft of the play Beckett \"uses 'beacon' and 'anemometer' rather than 'lighthouse' and 'wind-gauge'. The anemometer on the East Pier of Dún Laoghaire was one of the world's first. [It is] widely regarded as a mirror reflection of Beckett's own revelation. Yet it is different both in circumstance and kind.\"\n\n\"Beckett wrote to Richard Ellmann: 'All the jetty and howling wind are imaginary. It happened to me, summer 1945, in my mother's little house, named New Place, across the road from Cooldrinagh.'\"\n\nHe summarised what this experience signified for him:\nI realised that Joyce had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, [being] in control of one's material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs to see that. I realised that my own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding.\n\nBeckett has applied character to non-human elements in his plays before, e.g. the light in \"Play\", the music in \"Words and Music\". \"Beckett instructed the actor Pierre Chabert in his 1975 Paris production of the play 'to become as much as possible one body with the machine ... The spool is his whole life.'\" Krapp no longer owns the memories on the tapes. His mind is no longer capable of holding onto them. The recorder also serves as proxy. When John Hurt, as Krapp, is transfixed by the retelling of the events in the punt he literally cradles the machine as if it were the woman recalling Magee’s original performance; Beckett took pains to point this out to Alan Schneider, who was at the time preparing his own version of the play, in a letter dated 21 November 1958, and incorporated the gesture in future productions in which he was involved.\n\nLater, on 4 January 1960, Beckett wrote a more detailed letter describing another unexpected revelation of that earlier performance, \"the beautiful and quite accidental effect in London of the luminous eye burning up as the machine runs on in silence and the light goes down.\"\n\nIn 1996, the Gate Theatre visited the Lincoln center in New York where David Kelly performed ‘Krapp’ receiving standing ovations at every performance. Kelly had first performed the play in Dublin in 1959 and the original recordings of his ‘young self’ were discovered. These were painstakingly remastered by Noel Storey at Beacon studios in Dublin to be used on stage. It it believed to be the only time that real 30 year old recordings have been used.\nThe NY Times broke their own rules by sayin in their review that “Kelly’s performance is the best that will ever be”.\n\nBeckett told Patrick Magee, the original Krapp, that his \"voice was the one which he heard inside his mind. Thus it seems likely that the return to English was a matter of expediency because of the English-speaking actor.\"\n\nMagee had a harsh, gravely voice which had little superficial charm but had a hypnotic effect on the listener ... He was grey-haired but ageless and could combine debility with menace, as Beckett characters with their suppressed violence often do ... [H]e had developed a rather strange accent with only faint Irish overtones and prolonged vowel sounds, The general effect was strangely déclassé but still indubitably Irish and thus ideally fitted for the performance of Beckett ... As an actor, he had the good sense to see that one played Beckett for the weight and mood of the words and the situation without bothering about the ultimate philosophical import.\n\nThe Canadian actor Donald Davis played Krapp in the North American premiere production of \"Krapp's Last Tape\". \"The New York Times\" reported that Davis \"won an Obie Award in 1960 for his performance as the lonely, solitary Krapp, playing the tapes of his life and re-experiencing decades of regret.\" Later, \"Krapp's Last Tape,\" directed by Alan Schneider, was a long-running performance at the Provincetown Playhouse, for which a 33 RPM recording was issued (see article and liner notes).\n\nCo-Founder of the San Quentin Drama Workshop was directed by Beckett in 1977, Berlin.\n\nMax Wall performed Krapp on a number of occasions, including London's Greenwich Theatre (1975 – directed by Patrick Magee) and Riverside Studios (1986).\n\nJohn Hurt performed the role of Krapp for the version directed by Atom Egoyan for the project \"Beckett on Film\", which was broadcast on television in 2001 and available on DVD in the box set or individually. In November 2011, directed by Michael Colgan, he reprised the role pre-Broadway at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington DC followed by a limited Broadway run. He used the tape recordings from the 2001 production in the performance. In December 2011, again directed by Michael Colgan, he reprised the role in New York City at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the BAM 2011 Next Wave Festival. He once again took up the role in Dublin's Gate Theatre for 10 performances in March 2013.\n\nAs part of the 50th anniversary season of the Royal Court Theatre, in October 2006, directed by Ian Rickson, English playwright Harold Pinter performed the role of Krapp in a sold-out limited run of nine performances to great critical acclaim.\n\nCorin Redgrave performed the role of Krapp for BBC Radio 3 in 2006 a few months after he had suffered a major heart attack. The production was rebroadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 16 May 2010 as part of a double bill with a 2006 production of \"Embers\".\n\nBrian Dennehy performed the role of Krapp during the 2008 Stratford Shakespeare Festival and again in 2010 at the Goodman Theatre of Chicago, both times directed by Jennifer Tarver. The Beckett one-act was paired at both venues with Eugene O'Neill's \"Hughie\" (directed by Robert Falls), also a one-act, and also performed by Dennehy, in the lead role of Erie Smith. The show ran at the Goodman Theatre from 16 January through 28 February 2010. A Broadway run is also planned.\n\nIn April 2010 Irish actor Michael Gambon continued his relationship with both Beckett and the Gate Theatre when he returned to the Dublin stage as Krapp for a limited run which was followed by a transfer to London's West End.\n\nRichard Bremmer took on the eponymous role of Krapp at the Bristol Old Vic between April and May 2012, receiving critical acclaim across the board. This was in a double bill with A Kind of Alaska by Harold Pinter in which Bremmer also appeared. They were both directed by Simon Godwin.\n\nIn 2012, at Glasgow's Citizens Theatre, Gerard Murphy performed the role, even though he was suffering spinal cord compression due to prostate cancer.\n\nRobert Wilson performed Krapp at the Barbican, London, in June 2015.\n\nHe is slated to perform at the Alexander Kasser Theater on the campus of Montclair State University in March of 2016 \n\nJoe Gistirak played Krapp at the Above Board Theatre in 1978. It was directed by Michael Corrigan.\n\nIn 2018, Bob Nasmith played Krapp to mark the 50th anniversary of the opening of Theatre Passe Muraille in a production directed by Mac Fyfe.\n\nBeckett opposed vehemently the transfer of some of his works from one medium to another, but he did not oppose such recordings of \"Krapp's Last Tape\" as much as he did others. For example, \"A gramophone recording (New York: Spoken Arts #788, 1960), based on the original American production, was distributed by Argo (RG 220), and by HEAR, Home Educational Records, London (1964),\" and \"It was often adapted for television with his encouragement.\" The first BBC version was produced by Peter Luke, featuring Cyril Cusack (13 November 1963). Approached by Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Cologne, to permit a television version of his 1969 Schiller-Theatre \"Das letzte Band\" [the German title of the play], Beckett wrote a set of \"Suggestions for TV Krapp\", which \"was broadcast [on] 28th October 1969.\"\n\nThe play has subsequently been broadcast on radio, turned into an opera (see below) and filmed as part of the Beckett on Film project and for the DVD of Pinter's Royal Court performance, both of which have been shown on television.\n\nThere have been several musical adaptations of \"Krapp's Last Tape\", most notably the opera \"Krapp, ou, La dernière bande\" by composer Marcel Mihalovici. American composer Earl Kim alludes to the work within his \"Gooseberries, she said\" (1967), part of the four-part cycle \"Exercises en Route\". The Hungarian composer Gyula Csapó has created the work \"Krapp's Last Tape –- after Samuel Beckett\" (1975) loosely inspired by Beckett's play. This theatrical work is for a \"violinist-actor,\" a tape recorder, four spotlights and a sine wave generator. In 1999, the English experimental composer, Michael Parsons, adapted \"Krapp's Last Tape\" for piano, two pre-recorded pianos, and voice on tape. The piece, specifically written for John Tilbury, was called \"Krapp Music\".\n\nThe play was memorably parodied in the television sketch comedy \"The Fast Show\", in which – as a reference to Max Wall – fictional music hall comedian Arthur Atkinson played a comically more stoic version of Krapp. It is also the title of a track on Fredrik Thordendal's solo album Sol Niger Within.\nA prefiguring of the play, titled, \"Krapp, 39\" written and performed by Michael Laurence and directed by George Demas, premiered at the 2008 New York International Fringe Festival and begins its commercial run Off Broadway at The Soho Playhouse in New York City on 13 January 2009. The piece follows an actor's obsession with the character Krapp. In the Canadian film \"Meetings with a Young Poet\", the character of Lucia Martell wants the rights to the piece to transform it into a one-woman play as a vehicle for herself.\n\nThe play is mentioned in Charlie Kaufman's 2008 film \"Synecdoche, New York\" and in Spalding Gray's 'A Personal History of the American Theatre', a 1985 monologue directed for television by Skip Blumberg.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8745590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8745590", "title": "Literary forgery", "text": "Literary forgery\n\nLiterary forgery (also known as literary mystification, literary fraud or literary hoax) is writing, such as a manuscript or a literary work, which is either deliberately misattributed to a historical or invented author, or is a purported memoir or other presumably nonfictional writing deceptively presented as true when, in fact, it presents untrue or imaginary information.\n\nLiterary forgery may involve the work of a famous author whose writings have an established intrinsic, as well as monetary, value. In an attempt to gain the rewards of such a reputation, the forger often engages in two distinct activities. The forger produces a writing which resembles the style of the known reputable author to whom the fake is to be attributed. The forger may also fake the physical alleged original manuscript. This is less common, as it requires a great deal of technical effort, such as imitating the ink and paper. The forger then claims that, not only is the style of writing the same, but also that the ink and paper are of the kind or type used by the famous author. Other common types of literary forgery may draw upon the potential historical cachet and novelty of a previously undiscovered author.\n\nLiterary forgery has a long history. Onomacritus (c. 530 – 480 BCE) is among the most ancient known literary forgers. He invented prophecies, which he ascribed to the bard Musaeus.\n\nIn the 3rd century CE, a certain Septimius produced what appeared to be a Latin translation of an eyewitness account to the Trojan War by Dictys of Crete. In the letter of dedication, the translator gave additional credence to the document by claiming the Greek original had come to light during Nero's reign when Dictys' tomb was opened by an earthquake and his diary was discovered. Septimius then claimed the original had been handed to the governor of Crete, Rutilius Rufus, who gave the diary to Nero during his tour of Greece in 66-67 CE. According to historian Miriam Griffin, such bogus and romantic claims to antiquity were not uncommon at the time.\n\nOne of the longest lasting literary forgeries is by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a 5th-6th century Syrian mystical writer who claimed to be a disciple of Paul the Apostle. Five hundred years later, Abelard expressed doubts about the authorship, but it was not until after the Renaissance that there was general agreement that the attribution of the work was false. In the intervening 1,000 years, the writings had much theological influence.\n\nThomas Chatterton (1752–1770), the English poet and letter writer, began his brilliant medieval forgeries when little more than a child. While they brought him praise, and fame after his death, his writing afforded little in the way of financial success and he committed suicide aged 17, penniless, alone and half-starved.\n\nThe English Mercurie appeared to be the first English newspaper when it was discovered in 1794. This was, ostensibly, an account of the English battle with the Spanish Armada of 1588, but was, in fact, written in the 18th century by Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke, as a literary game with his friends.\n\nLiterary forgery was promoted as a creative method by Charles Nodier and, in the 19th century, many writers produced literary forgeries under his influence, notably Prosper Merimee and Pierre Louys.\n\n\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" was an antisemitic forged document first published in Russia. The abridged version was available to the public in 1903. The unabridged version was later edited by a retired officer of the Russian Imperial Guard, G.V. Butmi. This forgery exploits Jews by stating that Jews were inevitably trying to exercise a coup against Christianity in order to essentially rule the world. The document was exposed as plagiarism by English journalist Philip Graves in 1921. Graves exposed the strong similarities in the political satire by Maurice Joly, \"The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu\". The forged document was supported and promoted by Henry Ford in his newspaper, \"The Dearborn Independent\".\n\nThe genre of false and deceptive autobiography or fake memoirs has seen the rise of misery lit books, in which the author claims to have suffered illness, abuse, and/or drug abuse during his or her upbringing.\n\nStephen Longstreet, a prolific and popular novelist in the mid-20th century, referred to and eventually produced a manuscript called \"Nell Kimball: Her Life as an American Madam, by herself,\" allegedly penned by a prostitute who lived from (1854-1934) and worked in New Orleans. Additionally, the work was partly plagiarized from the works of Herbert Asbury. \n\nA recent example is \"Love and Consequences\" by Margaret B. Jones, the author's story about being a young American foster girl who was raised in a gangland culture in Los Angeles involving drugs, forced sex and criminality. The author, real name Margaret Seltzer, was exposed as a fraud by her elder sister: in reality, she has lived a middle-class life without trauma, and received a good education (which also included a course in creative writing).\n\nDanny Santiago, author of \"Famous All Over Town\", published a novel in which he depicts life through the eyes of a young Hispanic boy growing up in East Los Angeles. The novel won the Rosenthal Award for Literary Achievement in 1984, though suspicion arose about the true identity of Danny Santiago when the author refused to supply a biographical sketch for editors at Simon & Schuster who wanted to submit the book for a Pulitzer Prize. An investigation revealed that the writer was actually Daniel James, a middle- to older-aged Caucasian male writing from the standpoint of a young Latino American boy. He received criticism from the literary community, and gave up writing for good.\n\nJames Frey, another author chastised for forging his memoir, published \"A Million Little Pieces\", a memoir about his struggle with drug addiction and his journey through the inner working of the legal system and rehabilitation. The truth about his \"imagined escapades\" eventually came to light when his close family and friends revealed that he had actually never been a drug addict or incarcerated. Frey eventually faced more than 10 class action lawsuits, including negligence, false advertising, and breach of contract. At the heart of each suit was an allegation of fraud.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

The company publishes sheet music, hymnals, choral collections, cantatas, and Christmas plays.\n\nMajesty Music (originally Musical Ministries) was founded in 1973 by Frank Garlock (b. 1930), a musician with academic training from both Bob Jones University (BJU) and the Eastman School of Music. While teaching music theory at BJU, Garlock began a second career of \"challenging the rock culture,\" denouncing contemporary music for promoting \"rebellion\" and \"the violation of moral principles.\" Garlock feared that contemporary music styles were permeating evangelical churches as well as the larger society. Leaving the BJU faculty, he continued to conduct choral seminars to emphasize alternatives to contemporary music and (with the help of a wealthy friend) published, through his company, religious music written by himself, his daughter Shelly, and her husband Ron Hamilton (b. 1950). \n\nAfter losing an eye to cancer, Hamilton created the character \"Patch the Pirate,\" around which he based an album of children's songs, \"Sing Along with Patch the Pirate\" (1981). By 2018, Majesty Music had released 39 Patch the Pirate albums, sold more than a million recordings, and produced more than 800 of Hamilton's songs. In 1984, Majesty Music created Patch the Pirate clubs and published material for them that included Bible studies, devotional material, and elementary music theory lessons. Within ten years, more than 10,000 children were enrolled in the program. Majesty Music also supported an \"Adventures of Patch the Pirate\" radio broadcast, recognized by the National Religious Broadcasters as the country's third largest religious program for children, airing on more than 450 stations.\n\nBesides the Patch the Pirate material, Majesty Music has sold its own hymnals, sheet music, cantatas, and vocal and instrumental CDs and DVDs, some of them in Spanish. The company also continued to hold two-day music conferences. At first operating from Frank Garlock's garage, Majesty Music expanded several times and eventually occupied two adjacent buildings on Wade Hampton Boulevard within walking distance of Bob Jones University. In 2018, the company repurposed its underused recording facility to accommodate a music studio, Majesty Music Academy. During the late 1990s, the Garlocks began transferring ownership of the business to the Hamiltons; and in the 2010s, the Hamiltons made similar arrangements to perpetuate the ministry through their daughter, Megan, and her husband, Adam Morgan.\n"}

Private ownership of any publication or agency of the mass media was generally forbidden, although churches and other organizations published small periodicals and newspapers. Even with this informational monopoly in the hands of organizations under KSČ control, all publications were reviewed by the government's Office for Press and Information. Censorship was lifted for three months during the 1968 Prague Spring but afterward was reimposed under the terms of the 1966 Press Law. The law states that the Czechoslovak press is to provide complete information, but it must also advance the interests of socialist society and promote the people's socialist awareness of the policy of the communist party as the leading force in society and state. \n\nGovernment concern about control of the mass media was such that it was illegal to own a duplicating machine or to reproduce more than eleven copies of any printed material. Nevertheless, a fairly wide distribution of underground publications (popularly known as samizdat throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union) that were established during the Nazi occupation continued throughout communist rule into the 1980s.\n\n\nThe Czechoslovak Press Agency (in Czech: \"Československá tisková kancelář\", in Slovak: \"Československá tlačová kancelária\" ČTK / ČTK) received a state subsidy and was controlled by the federal government through its Presidium.\n\nThe government also controlled several domestic television and radio networks. \n\nCzechoslovak Television started broadcasting in 1953 from Prague, in 1955 from Ostrava and in 1956 from Bratislava. Daily broadcasting started in 1959, broadcasting in colour in 1970 from Bratislava. A second TV channel was added in 1970. Since then, the first TV channel was conceived as a federal one (i.e. mostly in Czech, but also in Slovak), the second TV channel was different for the Czech Socialist Republic (in Czech) and for the Slovak Socialist Republic (in Slovak). A third TV channel was added only in the mid-late 1980s. It broadcast the First Programme of Soviet Union Central Television. \n\nIn addition, many citizens in Czechoslovakia were able to pick up foreign radio and television stations (terrestrially and in late 1980s over satellite). TV stations, for example, could often be picked up (depending on which part of the country one lived in) both from the communist Poland, Hungary and the German Democratic Republic, and from the noncommunist countries Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany).\n\nThe relatively attractive TV programmes from Austria and West Germany had a sizable influence on the population . TV was not jammed by the authorities. The radio station Voice of America and the BBC World Service also had some audiences in Czechoslovakia, and their broadcasts were subject to only occasional jamming. Radio Free Europe broadcasts, however, were extensively jammed.\n\n\n"}

He made his debut as a pianist at the age of 11 in Brno performing a piano concerto by Hummel. Because his parents weren't satisfied with his career choice, he ran away to Vienna at the age of twelve, where he studied under Simon Sechter. He also studied singing under Giuditta Pasta for some time.\n\nIn 1843, he met tenor Salvatore Patti (1800–1869) at a music festival in Vicenza. Five years later, he was tour manager of Patti group in New York. These performances started his successful career as a manager in the United States and his long-standing friendship with the Patti family. In 1852, Strakosch married Patti's daughter Amalia Patti. He was also the first manager of the youngest and most successful daughter, Adelina Patti, from her debut in 1859 until her marriage in 1868. It is believed that Strakosch was her most important teacher.\n\nBesides the Pattis, he and his brother Max (born in Brunn, Moravia, 27 September 1835; died in New York City, 17 March 1892) worked as impresario with Teresa Parodi, Christine Nilsson, Marie Heilbronn, Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa, Carlotta Patti, Karl Formes, Pasquale Brignoli, Italo Campanini, Pauline Lucca, Thérèse Tietjens, Louis M. Gottschalk, Clara Louise Kellogg, Marie Roze and Marietta Alboni.\n\nStrakosch occasionally performed as a pianist, e.g. he played duet with Ole Bull during his tour in America. In 1857, his opera \"Giovanna of Naples\" (Regina Giovanna di Napoli) was performed in New York. His compositions for the piano were at one time very popular, and among them the music of one of Bayard Taylor's songs.\n\nIn 1886, he published a memoir book \"Souvenirs d'un impresario\" (Souvenirs of an Impresario).

{"id": "8387128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8387128", "title": "Phone sex", "text": "Phone sex\n\nPhone sex is a conversation between two or more people on the phone where one or more of the individuals is describing the act of sex.\n\nPhone sex takes imagination on both parties' part; virtual sex is difficult if the operator does not put the images in the head of the caller and the caller must be open to the pleasure as well. The sexually explicit conversation takes place between two or more persons via telephone, especially when at least one of the participants masturbates or engages in sexual fantasy.\n\nPhone sex conversation may take many forms, including: guided fantasy, sexual sounds, narrated and enacted suggestions; sexual anecdotes and confessions; candid expression of sexual fantasies, feelings, or love, and/or discussion of very personal and sensitive sexual topics.\n\nOnce means of transmitting payment were developed, phone sex turned into primarily a commercial activity, with customers (overwhelmingly male) and sellers (overwhelmingly female).\n\nPhone sex does not involve physical contact between those participating in it. Couples may choose to engage in phone sex when the inconvenience of distance makes physical intimacy inopportune.\n\nDue to the potential for emotional intimacy between those who have engaged in phone sex, it is a matter of some debate whether phone sex is to be considered infidelity when involving a person outside of a committed personal relationship. Nevertheless, phone sex should not be confused with prostitution wherein money is exchanged for real life sexual services or physical interaction.\n\nThe editor of \"High Society\" magazine, Gloria Leonard, is credited with being one of the first people to use \"976 numbers\", then \"900 numbers\" for promotional purposes and soon as a revenue stream in the adult industry. Leonard recorded her own voice informing callers of the contents of the next issue of \"High Society\" magazine before its publication. Later she recorded others such as Annie Sprinkle \"talking sexy\". Leonard convinced magazine owner Carl Ruderman to purchase more of these numbers and the business began to be successful using the magazine to promote the service. Leonard herself was surprised at the success of these numbers.\n\nOriginally phone sex services consisted of a managed network of dispatchers (live or automated) and erotic performers. Performers would come to a studio where they received a cubicle, coaching, and cash incentives to keep callers on the line longer. This is the world portrayed in Spike Lee's movie about phone sex, Girl 6. At that time independent phone sex was more dangerous, as Lee's movie portrays.\n\nWith the progress of technology it became more practical, convenient, and economical for providers to work out of their homes. Human dispatchers — female, except for gay male phone sex — answered the advertised phone numbers, processed payment via credit card, chose who of the available performers in the dispatcher's judgment best matched the clients' fantasy (grandma, black girl, college girl, etc.), and connected the client with the provider. The caller could not see the performer's number. Either could hang up, though some services put economic pressure on providers not to do so.\n\nOriginally, per-minute billing was provided by phone companies (in the U.S., using 976, then 900 numbers). There was, from some services, an attempt to keep the caller aroused but short of orgasm, so he would spend more money. (This attitude still survives among some providers.) When public (mostly female) pressure forced the phone companies to stop providing this service to sex workers, a transition was made to a manual method: pre-paid blocks of time, 10, 30, 60 minutes, whatever the customer would pay for. The incentives for providers were then reversed; rather than earning money from keeping the customer on the line (orgasm delayed), they earned more from bringing the caller to orgasm quickly, so as to move on rapidly to another call. Unused minutes were rarely usable on a second call. The provider provided (say) 10 minutes of service, but got to keep all of the money (say 20 minutes).\n\nWhen the Internet got relatively mature, sale of any sexual service not involving a minor could be made to anyone not a minor. Software platforms were custom written to handle money collection and transfer, connecting caller and sex worker though neither could see anything but the platform's phone number, and metering the connection. Details vary significantly from one platform to another, but the provider may be given a personal page on the platform to use however she (sometimes he) wishes. All have some way for a provider to post a picture and some text. Big platforms as of 2016 are Niteflirt, TalktoMe, and My Phone Site; the latter also includes provision by which a manager, with the consent of the providers, could have a virtual shop with many providers under them. Foreign (non-US) customers were courted. Customers had a variety of payment options, and pages of providers to choose from, sometimes with voice samples available. In concept they have a lot in common with platforms such as Ebay: the seller provides the picture(s), description, and sets the price, a percentage of which is kept by the platform. In the sex industry, similar platforms emerged facilitating the selling of used panties and other odoriferous garments, and for \"cam\" video sessions, in which the customer, for a fee, can direct the woman on the video screen, and for a higher fee, have a private connection (no one can see caller or provider except each other).\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, nearly all of the major local phone companies in the United States, plus the major long distance carriers, were actively involved in the adult chat line business. The telephone companies would provide billing services for chat line companies. Typically the telephone companies would bill callers to chat lines and then remit 45% of the money collected to chat line operators. The telephone companies placed the chat line charges on a customer's local phone bill. If a customer disputed a charge, the telephone company would usually “forgive” the charge but block the caller from calling any other chat lines. In 1988, the American phone sex industry generated an estimated $54 million annually (for both producers and telecommunications providers), according to the Information Industry Bulletin.\n\nBy 2007 only Verizon, Sprint and AT&T remained in the chat line business in the U.S. By 2007 Verizon and MCI had merged and only a few chat line companies remained active as a result. Verizon provided billing services to calls made in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine. AT&T and MCI offered nationwide collection services, with a cap of $50 per call.\n\nIn 2002 profits from phone sex were estimated at one billion dollars a year. In 2007 the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington estimated that phone sex earned U.S. telephone companies close to $500 million per year.\n\nThe vast majority of modern services in the United States use toll-free numbers whereby clients can dial up to request a call with a particular performer using credit cards, ACH Network systems, and a variety of other billing methods. There are still some services that rely upon premium-rate telephone numbers (e.g., 976 and 900 numbers) for billing purposes, although this practice has been largely abandoned due to the high rate of fraud associated with these lines and the inability to dial 900 and 976 lines from cellular phones. As a direct result, most telephone companies allow their customers to block outgoing calls to premium-rate telephone numbers. In 1996, the FCC changed regulations on 900 numbers to address abuse of these services by minors and fraud concerns.\n\nIndependent phone sex operators engage in self-promotion. This self-promotion can involve a personalized website where the phone sex performer lists their specialties and services, engaging prospects in social media, various methods of advertising (via the traditional methods listed below, or on organized third-party network sites that provide a basic level of privacy for performer and client alike) and/or surfing of sexually themed chat rooms for interested clients.\n\nPhone sex service providers typically advertise their services in men's magazines, in pornographic magazines and videos, on late-night cable television, and online. Some phone sex services use state-of-the-art customer acquisition techniques such as active database marketing to reach potential clients. These advertising methods almost invariably target men, the primary consumers of phone sex services.\n\nThe major phone sex and adult chat lines spend millions of dollars in advertising every month. Thanks to technology, their marketing departments can track the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns by assigning unique phone numbers to each advertising campaign, regardless if it includes TV, print, online or a combination of all these. Unique numbers might either be toll-free 1-800 numbers or local access numbers in order to accommodate callers who have been targeted in a local advertising campaign. Phone sex services will usually list all the local numbers on their websites. Assigning unique phone numbers to each advertising channel allows phone chat companies to measure not only the number of calls that each channel generates but also the price per call, conversion rate, and return on investment. This information can be further analyzed to determine key insights such as the most and least profitable caller's demographics, best and worst times to advertise and ultimately which advertising channels to invest more in and which ones to cut.\n\nPhone sex lines appeared in the UK in the 1980s using premium-rate telephone numbers for adult services with sexual content, with many of the lines playing tape recordings. The phone sex market in the UK is closely linked to the pornographic magazine market, and advertising for such services often provides a vital element of a magazine's revenue. Up to a quarter of the page length of some magazines may be devoted to such advertisements. Advertising in newspapers, which had been common in the 1980s, was ended as a result of regulatory changes in 1994 which restricted advertisements to top-shelf adult magazines. At the same time rules were introduced requiring the user to pro-actively opt-in by requesting a pin number. This dramatically reduced the number of calls, and the proportion of the income generated by premium-rate telephone numbers which was associated with adult services fell from 18% in 1992 to 1% in 1996. During the 1990s many companies began to re-route their traffic abroad in an attempt to circumvent the regulations. The industry took to operating from 40 countries worldwide, commonly Guyana and the Caribbean. In 1995 the income generated in this way was $2 billion. The regulations also led to an increase in the use of live call-back services paid by credit cards, which did not fall under the regulator's jurisdiction because they did not use premium-rate numbers. By 2009 the proportion of the UK population that had used phone sex lines was 45%, according to a survey by Durex. By 2013 there were over 2,000 phone sex companies in the UK. Most phone sex workers are recruited through word of mouth or the internet as the companies are widely forbidden from advertising in mass media. The number of female university students working for phone sex lines in the UK doubled between 2011 and 2013, according to a BBC-commissioned investigation. The industry's regulatory body Phone-paid Services Authority (formerly ICSTIC and PhonePayPlus) monitors and enforces specific community standards in terms of content and price for premium rate numbers.\n\nThe legality of phone sex businesses was challenged by the U.S. Federal government in July 1988 with the passage of the Telephone Decency Act, which made it a crime to use a \"telephone ... directly or by recording device\" to make \"any obscene or indecent communication for commercial purposes to any person,\" punishable by a $50,000 fine or six months in prison.\" At the time the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was responsible for policing 900 numbers for obscenity and indecency.\n\nSable Communications of California filed suit against the FCC in federal court to overturn the Telephone Decency Act. On July 19, 1988, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima ruled that \"the prohibition against 'indecent speech' on 900-number recordings was unconstitutional, though its ban on 'obscene speech' could stand.\"\n\nOn June 23, 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that obscene speech, even in commercial telephone calls, was not protected, though indecent speech was. Justice Byron White wrote for the high court's majority\n\nA phone sex worker is a type of sex worker and pornographic actor, sometimes referred to as a \"phone sex operator\", \"fantasy artist\", \"adult phone entertainer\", \"audio erotic performer\", or any one of other monikers. The most valued attributes of a phone sex professional are his or her voice, acting and sexual roleplay skills, along with the experienced ability to discern and respond appropriately to a broad spectrum of customer requests.\n\nSeveral online companies provide Internet-based phone sex lines. These services enable callers to post profiles of themselves and then engage in VOIP-based and other types of online sex.\n\n\n\n"}

However, Just two weeks later \"The Urban Warriors\" would win a return match to take the titles away from \"The Boogie Knights\", but not before having a public disagreement in the ring. This would lead to both men vacating the championships the very next morning.\n\nOn Sunday March 23, 2003 an 8-team tournament was held in Sheffield, containing many top tag teams in the country. The Champions were crowned when Andi Le Bon and Karl Harker, known as the \"Brit Pack\", narrowly defeated the combination of \"Golden Boy\" Cameron Knite and Chris Lightning in the final.\n\nThe pair would hold the titles for a few months before being defeated by the team of Domino and \"Rage\" Andy Baker in July 2003 in Sheffield, England. \n\nThe next month RBW's working relationship with UKWA was announced and on a joint show RBW wrestlers Stixx and \"The Gift\" Ross Jordan would defeat the UKWA team and bring the titles under the RBW banner.\n\nWith the United Kingdom Wrestling Alliance's relationship with Revolution British Wrestling announced, a revolutionary new rule was introduced, where the Champions could consist of three wrestlers, as opposed to just two. When it came to Championship defenses, the Champion team could consist of any two of the three.\n\nIn Killamarsh, during November 2003, Stixx was in singles action, meaning that Ross Jordan needed to use the unknown third partner. After the original chosen partner Kruiz wasn't available, Ross Jordan and Stixx announced that J.C Thunder had moved to the South of England, to get away from the North, and was now the third partner of the Tag Team Champions, which was soon named the \"Southern Alliance\".\n\nSince then, the group shifted its members with Ross Jordan leaving and being replaced by Chris Wyld as the third man that would defend the Championship. The Southern Alliance group kept a stronghold on the British Tag Team Championships until UKWA's hiatus in August 2004 and the eventual closer of RBW in late 2005.\n\nIn early 2006 it was announced that United Kingdom Wrestling Alliance would be set to return later in 2006. This announcement came from UKWA's Director of Sports Entertainment, Andrew Huntington, who also stated that UKWA would also recognise \"The Southern Alliance\" as their current UKWA British Tag Team Champions.\n\n\n"}

It has been featured in magazines like \"Vertical Life\". Competition climbing is managed by Sport Climbing Australia, and has seen a surge in participation since rock climbing's inclusion in the Olympics.\n\nLike Europe and America, the climbing culture of Australia has its roots in alpinism and exploration. Early European exploration was focused in southeast of Queensland in the Blue Mountains. There, the seemingly endless sandstone walls and the imagining of the landscape represented in the local newspapers helped to spread interest climbing peaks. Between 1927 and 1938 there were 150 articles, most of which are accompanied by photographs. It became traditional to set peaks on fire after reaching them, to signal success to the rest of the ascensionists' party on the ground.\n\nLittle is known about rock climbing in Aboriginal Australian culture, but today many mountains are sacred sites.\n\nThe difficulty of the climbs gradually increased, with some stylistic differences between Queensland and NSW climbers, with the former often climbing free solo and NSW climbers relying heavily on ropes. Some of the early bold ascents include \"Crater Bluff (9)\" by Eric Dark and Dorothy English in 1936, and \"Federation Peak (5)\" in 1949.\n\nAustralian climbing began pushing into higher grades in the late 1950s with the first grade 17.\n\nIn the 1960s John Ewbank developed the Ewbank System for grading climbs, the worlds first open ended system.\n\n"}

{"id": "4804980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4804980", "title": "Strawberry Panic!", "text": "Strawberry Panic!\n\nFollowing \"Strawberry Panic!\"'s first run in \"Dengeki G's Magazine\" it was six months before results began to indicate that the series was a success, and that its fans were growing in number; the manga and light novels which followed were a reflection of its popularity. The series became sufficiently popular for Seven Seas Entertainment to license the manga series and light novels for English language distribution. \"Strawberry Panic!\" was one of the debut titles on the company's light novel and yuri manga production lines. An anime television series was produced in 2006 by Madhouse and is licensed by Media Blasters. A visual novel was produced in 2006 by MediaWorks for the PlayStation 2.\n\nThere is a slight difference in the title of the series between media and national affiliation. The original short stories, manga, light novels, and video game used the exclamation mark in the title; the anime excluded it. When the manga and light novel series were licensed for English language distribution, Seven Seas Entertainment did not use the exclamation mark in the title. The appearance of the logo for \"Strawberry Panic!\" has changed four times. The subtitle \"Girls' School in Fullbloom\" was added during the short stories stage, and later appeared on the Japanese covers of the light novels, manga, and video game version, but was excluded from the anime adaptation and the English covers of the light novels and manga.\n\nThe setting for \"Strawberry Panic!\" is , a very large hilltop where the three affiliated schools of Miator, Spica and Lulim, are located. Each school has its own student council, which governs the matters of each respective school. Periodically the three student councils, along with the Etoiles, meet in the Astraea Joint Student Council. The Astraea Hill school system employs the Scottish system of grade numbering. Students are ranged from grades one through six, the equivalent of the three years of junior-high and high school in Japan, and seventh through twelfth grade in North America.\n\nThe hill is known as a sacred area which no men are allowed to enter. A prominent feature is a very large Catholic church in the center of the hill near a small lake; the church can be seen from a long distance away. There is a horse ranch at Spica. The students may go and study for their classes at a library on the lake's shore. Although only implied in the anime, the manga explains that the library building has another name, \"The Secret Garden\". It is well-known on campus as a \"rendezvous\" for secret lovers.\n\nStudents living on campus occupy a dormitory referred to as the , although its correct name is \"Astraea Dormitory\", named after Astraea Hill. The building is a triangular shape, allowing for the segregation of students from the three schools; each section is about the same size. It was built about 100 years before the story begins, around the same time that Miator was established, for students whose homes are far away. Each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation. If there is an odd number of students enrolled in a given year, one of the new students must live alone until a student in their year transfers into their school.\n\nThe building's name is based on its similarity to the cross-section of a strawberry viewed from above. When \"Strawberry Panic!\" was initially created, the three schools were arranged in a triangle, with the Strawberry Dorms in the center, and the dormitory was not a single building but three separate dormitories also arranged in a triangle around a central courtyard.\n\nThe plot of \"Strawberry Panic!\" revolves around the lives of the adolescents who attend one of three affiliated all-girl schools which share a campus and dormitories. The schools are: St. Miator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's Girls' School. There are twelve characters the story revolves around, four at each school. The story's main character is Nagisa Aoi, a young girl entering her fourth year at St. Miator after being transferred from another school. On first entering the campus grounds, she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds trying to work out where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student named Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astraea Hill's Etoile, a very important person who acts as a representative between the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill. Nagisa is instantly overcome by Shizuma's beauty, and after Shizuma kisses her on the forehead, Nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in the school's infirmary. In an adjacent chair is another girl of the same age, Tamao Suzumi, who informs her that they are to be roommates in the dormitory.\n\nIn the ensuing story, Nagisa is introduced to other students from each of the three schools; some she admires, some she is intimidated by, and some are merely friends encountered while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the relationships the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of \"Strawberry Panic!\" are the lesbian relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story of what happens to the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the media type, the depiction of the relationships between the girls is variously presented, with more explicit fan service – appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations – in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of astronomical star imagery is seen throughout the series, as well as minor Catholic religious undertones including a St. Mary statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.\n\nAt each of the three schools, there are four main characters, who comprise the original twelve characters created for the short stories when the series began. Only those twelve appear in the subsequently adapted visual novel version. Other characters were introduced in the manga and light novel versions to create plotlines and conflict, and these additional characters are also featured in the anime adaptation.\n\n\n\n is a French word meaning \"star\". The Etoile system of Astraea Hill is employed as the internal politics between the schools and governs school operations. Little is shown as to the influence the teachers and sisters have on the inter-school politics. The system is designed for two Etoiles to be instated at the same time in order to work as a team. In the anime, Shizuma Hanazono is the sole Etoile, the other Etoile having died, which is explained in the latter part of the story. The two Etoiles are seen as figureheads for Astraea Hill. Although Astraea has three schools, both Etoiles must come from the same school. They have certain specific duties, such as greeting new students arriving at Astraea Hill, participating in important school events, and serving as mediator between disputes in student council meetings of the three schools, among others. They are given a private greenhouse in which to grow flowers for use during school events.\n\nThe Etoiles are elected after going through what is known as , which consists of three competitions in the light novels and the manga versions. The higher scoring pairs from the first two competitions carry on to the third competition, and the pair that wins the third competition becomes the Etoile Couple. In the anime, the competition aspect of the story is toned down. Still, it facilitates the culmination of the story in the finale, and thus serves an important purpose. Once the winners have been named, a special ceremony marks the end of the election, at which the president of the student council from the school that won the election presents two necklaces for the winners to wear during their tenure as Etoiles. They are both identical except for the colors of the pendants: one is red, the other is blue. The older student receives the blue pendant and the younger of the two is given the red pendant.\n\nSince the first issue of ASCII Media Works' \"Dengeki G's Magazine\" was published, the editors of the magazine have hosted reader participation games whose outcome is directly influenced by the people who read the magazine. \"Strawberry Panic!\"s origin was in the October 2003 issue of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\" where it was announced after the ending of Sakurako Kimino's previous work \"Sister Princess\" that a new reader participation project would start the following month. In the November 2003 issue, the first batch of characters from St. Miator were introduced (Nagisa, Shizuma, Tamao, and Chiyo) and it was revealed how readers could participate in the project. The initial system had the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna (given without surnames) who were sisters and at the same time younger sisters of the readers of the magazine, effectively putting the reader in the position of the elder brother. Each girl entered her respective school and became the main character of that school. It was explained that the coupling of the main characters could be to an upperclassman, a classmate, or an underclassman, but had to stay within the school they attended. For example, Nagisa, who attended Miator could not be coupled with another character from either Spica or Lulim at first. Playing the role of the elder brother, the reader gave advice to the younger sisters who were bewildered by their new lives at each of the schools. Thus, the readers had the ability to influence the coupling formations which would later be written by Kimino as short stories serialized in \"Dengeki G's Magazine\".\n\nIn December 2003, the characters from Spica (Hikari, Amane, Yaya, and Tsubomi) and Lulim (Kizuna, Chikaru, Remon, and Kagome) were introduced and in the January 2004 issue the first illustrations of the three schools and the Strawberry Dorms were published, drawn by Chitose Maki; the reader participation game began in this issue. Polls were posted in the January 2004 issue where the readers could vote on how the story would start and progress in the following months. Before the votes were counted, the first three short stories were written and published in the February 2004 issue of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\". Each story featured an illustration of the two girls who were the couple paired in each respective story.\n\nWhen the results of the polls were printed in the March 2004 issue, the rules of the game had been changed from the original concept, showing that readers wanted to focus on the relationships between the girls, and in this respect, the readers could vote on who they wanted to be coupled together. The number of votes for this first round were less than 2000. Noting this, the editorial staff lifted the restriction on only coupling within the same school, along with the restriction of only allowing the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna to couple. This resulted in a total of 66 different possibilities between the twelve characters in the series. In this issue, it was explained that four events were planned for the stories that followed: Easter, Athletic Carnival, Cultural Festival, and Christmas Bazaar. The \"Etoile\" title was born in this issue, which was initially used to crown the best couple voted first by the readers in each of the four events to follow. These events were going to be carried out by the three schools in cooperation. It became such that the planning of the schools resulted in them in a triangle position, having the dormitories at the center. The reader's position as the elder brother was canceled in this issue, and the game became a simple popularity vote for coupling. Due to this new system, Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna ceased to be sisters; surnames were later added to clarify this. After the first story arc of the short stories concluded, it was shown that the number of votes had increased sharply due to the new voting mechanisms. The Etoile voting was announced in the July 2004 issue to take place every month as opposed to every two months which had been the case beforehand. The deadline for voting was shifted to the middle of every month, and online voting was introduced. In September 2004, the voting for the next Etoile was shifted to be online-only; the voting for the \"Dormitory Panic\" arc became mail voting only.\n\nThe reader participation game ended after ten rounds of voting in the February 2005 issue of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\" where it was announced that the series would be continued in other forms, such as the light novels and manga that followed. The original short stories and the poll results of the reader participation game were used as a basis for subsequent releases of \"Strawberry Panic!\".\n\nThe first results of the polls from the reader participation project appeared in the form of the first three short stories which resulted from direct fan involvement in the March 2004 issue of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\". The stories were written by Sakurako Kimino and illustrated by Chitose Maki. Over the following months, the stories continued, producing the first story arc named the containing eighteen stories which ran between March and July 2004. Due to the concerns that there was not enough time between the Athletic Festival (an early summer event) and the Cultural Festival (an autumn event), the second, and last, story arc named the containing seven stories began the next month, running between August 2004 and January 2005. The second arc's stories, which were longer than the earlier pieces, involved taking one of the three main characters, performing coupling for them with one of the other eleven girls and presenting them in various situations. None of the original stories were ever published again in bound volumes. The stories themselves were more or less vignettes, in which each gave a brief glimpse into what was referred to as a \"yuri coupling\".\n\nBetween May and September 2005, a revised series of the short stories was produced; once per month, five more supplementary short stories were published during this time period, each of which was longer than any of the previous pieces. Although each individual story had its own title, the stories were under the collective title of \"The Girls, who art in heaven\". After the ending of this short compilation in September 2005, it was decided that the original illustrator, Chitose Maki, would be replaced by Namuchi Takumi for future \"Strawberry Panic!\" projects.\n\nBetween November 2005 and December 2006, Lantis Web Radio hosted a radio show entitled . The show was hosted by Mai Nakahara, who voiced Nagisa Aoi in the anime edition, and Ai Shimizu, who voiced both Tamao Suzumi and Kizuna Hyūga in the anime. The show contained sixty-one episodes, which were divided between three CDs; the first went on sale on March 8, 2006. The other two releases came out on July 5, 2006 and January 11, 2007 in Japan. The radio show included nine guests who had played other voice acting roles in the anime version, and Rino, singer of the opening theme \"Sweetest\" in the PlayStation 2 game version.\n\nThe \"Strawberry Panic!\" manga, written by Sakurako Kimino and illustrated by Namuchi Takumi, was serialized in \"Dengeki G's Magazine\" between September 30, 2005 and February 28, 2007 with a new chapter released once a month. Two bound volumes have been published in Japan under MediaWorks' \"Dengeki Comics\" label. The first went on sale on March 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Shizuma on the cover, and the second volume came out on October 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Tamao on the cover. While the manga's story is unfinished, \"Strawberry Panic!\" has not made an appearance in \"Dengeki G's Magazine\" since the publication of the April 2007 issue on February 28, 2007. Major differences between the anime and manga center around the plot and character interaction. Characters have vastly different character designs, such as Shion Tōmori and Kaname Kenjō. The manga introduces the Etoile election early on while the anime waits until the latter part of the series for dramatic effect. The first volume was released in English on December 23, 2007, the second in March 2008, and the omnibus with two additional chapters in October 2010, published by Seven Seas Entertainment.\n\nThe announcement that a \"Strawberry Panic!\" light novel series was to be written based on the original short stories appeared in the April 2005 issue of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\". Work on writing and illustrating the novels began in May 2005, by the same two people who worked on the manga. The announcement that the writing was finished appeared in the September 2005 issue of the same magazine, although the first novel was published by MediaWorks on their \"Dengeki Bunko\" publishing label, on March 10, 2006. The first volume had Shizuma and Nagisa on the cover and the second volume, released on August 9, 2006, had Amane and Hikari on the cover. The third and last volume, released on December 10, 2006, had Chikaru and Kizuna on the cover.\n\nSeven Seas Entertainment announced on September 13, 2006 that they had licensed the right to release the English translations of the \"Strawberry Panic!\" light novels and the manga series. After several delays, the English version of the first light novel was released in March 2008, and the second volume light novel was released on July 8, 2008. An omnibus volume containing the three light novels was released in June 2011.\n\nThe anime series, entitled \"Strawberry Panic\" (without the exclamation mark), was produced by the Japanese animation studio Madhouse and directed by Masayuki Sakoi. The series was composed by Tatsuhiko Urahata, and featured two other screenwriters Hideo Takayashiki and Kazuyuki Fudeyasu. The character design was done by Kyūta Sakai, working from the original designs by Chitose Maki and later Namuchi Takumi. The twenty-six episode anime aired in Japan between April 3 and September 25, 2006, and has a central yuri theme.\n\nThe anime series is mainly based on the short stories and manga which preceded it. The anime focuses on Nagisa Aoi and, to a slightly lesser extent, Hikari Konohana, and the three girls that they each are or become close to at their respective schools; some admire them or wish to be their friend, and others are vying for their affections. Of particular focus are the romantic relationships between Nagisa and Shizuma Hanazono and between Hikari and Amane Ōtori. The series culminates in the election of the new Etoile pairing, although this aspect of the story is downplayed compared to the manga. Fan service, or giving appealing visuals of the girls nude or in provocative situations, is seen in the anime, but only briefly.\n\nIn Japan, eight DVD compilations, in regular and special editions, were released containing three episodes each, between June 23, 2006, and January 25, 2007. The regular and special editions are similar in content, but the special editions are packaged in jacket sleeve, and contain an original booklet which includes additional merchandise such as portable plates and straps. The special edition includes different versions of the opening and closing themes, and deleted scenes. Media Blasters released five English-subtitled DVDs of \"Strawberry Panic\" between March 4, 2007 and November 11, 2008. The English-subtitled DVDs contain five episodes, except for its first release, which contains six. The series premiered on Toku in the United States in January 2016.\n\nThe original soundtrack for the anime adaptation was first released on September 6, 2006 by Lantis. On September 21, 2006, the soundtrack for the video game was released by the same company. The two opening themes for the anime, \"Shōjo Meiro de Tsukamaete\" and \"Kuchibiru Daydream\" were sung by Aki Misato. The \"Shōjo Meiro de Tsukamaete\" single was released on April 26, 2006, and reached an Oricon chart position of thirty-eight; \"Kuchibiru Daydream\" was released on August 9, 2006, and achieved forty-seven in the charts. The two main closing themes for the anime, \"Himitsu Dolls\" (released on May 24, 2006) and \"Ichigo Tsumi Monogatari\" (released on August 23, 2006), were sung by Mai Nakahara and Ai Shimizu as a duet. The final closing theme in the last episode was a slower remix version of \"Shōjo Meiro de Tsukamaete\", sung by Aki Misato.\n\nThere have been three drama CDs released based on the anime adaptation. The first, entitled \"Strawberry Panic Lyric 1 \"Miator volume\"\" was released in Japan on July 26, 2006. It featured the same voice actresses from the anime, and featured thirteen characters. It came with a CD containing twelve tracks of small scenes involving the characters in various situations. The second drama CD, \"Strawberry Panic Lyric 2 \"Spica volume\"\" was released on October 25, 2006 and a third was released on December 6, 2006 titled \"Strawberry Panic Lyric 3 \"Lulim volume\"\".\n\nA visual novel named \"Strawberry Panic! Girls' School in Fullbloom\" was released on the PlayStation 2 on August 24, 2006 in Japan by MediaWorks. Two versions of the game were released, a regular edition and a limited edition which included a drama CD; there is a different cover for each of the versions. The drama CD contained three tracks, one for students of each school.\n\nThere are three playable characters, one from each of the schools: Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna. They have no family names in the game, as when the series of short stories were first published. While Ai Shimizu maintained her role for Kizuna in the game, Miyuki Sawashiro performed the voice for Tamao Suzumi. The game features a \"boy mode\" and a \"girl mode\". Choosing the male version means that the story is told via emails from the player's younger sister; choosing the female version means that the story is told in the player's own diary. The player is given the chance to pair their chosen character with one of the other nine available girls, not including the other possible playable characters. There are twenty-seven different combinations depending on which girl the player chooses at the start of the game.\n\nThe game is played over the course of a school semester; the first day of school is on April 1. In \"boy mode\", each day concludes with a super deformed image of the heroine the player chose at the onset of the game slumped over her computer in her room; an email message from a girl that she interacted with during the day in on the monitor. As the heroine sleeps, the object of her affection appears in a thought bubble above her head. In \"girl mode\", she is seen writing in her diary instead. The first day in the game requires no interaction from the player. The player gets through the first day by reading the text and getting acquainted with the girls. The game uses an angel and devil system where miniature angel and devil versions of each girl float beside her when critical decisions have to be made; this is not restricted to the three playable characters. It also features a \"Strawberry chance\" system, where the outcome of some scenes changes if the player presses one of the analog sticks fast enough after the message is displayed in the upper right screen corner.\n\nDuring the reader participation game running in \"Dengeki G's Magazine\", voting polls were first posted in the January 2004 issue of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\", which were to determine who would be the subjects in the couplings between the characters of each respective school. The results were printed in the March 2004 issue, after about 1,979 votes had been cast. The three couples with the highest number of votes were Nagisa/Tamao at 481 votes, Hikari/Amane at 343 votes, and Kizuna/Chikaru at 260 votes. The results from the second round of voting were published in the May 2004 issue of the magazine which included the figures for the sixty-four different combinations between the twelve girls. The three couples with the highest number of votes this time were Nagisa/Tamao again at 150 votes, Nagisa/Amane at 114 votes, and Hikari/Amane for a second time at 102 votes. In the third round of voting in the July 2004 issue, the number of votes increased dramatically; the number one voted couple for the third time in a row was Nagisa/Tamao at 1,215 votes.\n\nThe \"Strawberry Panic!\" short stories were initially panned by Erica Friedman as being \"distinctly derivative of \"Maria-sama ga Miteru\"\". Friedman is the president of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the stories as, \"candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not much of anything else to support it\". After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version, Friedman later changed her opinion slightly, writing that \"[the anime] turned out pretty good\". She went on to say, \"There's no denying that \"Strawberry Panic!\" wasn't brilliant, but considering that it was meant to be trashy, it pulled out a few moments of dignity and elegance out of the trash heap.\" Jason Thompson regarded the \"Strawberry Panic!\" manga as \"a nearly plotless cascade [where] everything seems rushed, and it is difficult to keep track of the characters and plot.\"\n\nThe five subtitled DVDs released by Media Blasters were reviewed by Anime News Network (ANN). The first DVD was declared rental-worthy by ANN, citing the characters as being \"a lot of fun\" and the series as being a \"very laid-back show\" that would work well as a relaxing watch over a weekend. The content, however, was described as getting the series off to a \"slow start\", with limitations of the first six episodes being the lack in fan service, humor, and that it \"struggles to find any other reason to be compelling\". The second DVD, containing episodes seven through eleven, was reviewed as failing to \"materialize much real plot\" and content of the episodes was described as existing \"only to appeal to otaku who can get excited about moe content\". The third DVD, compiling episodes twelve through sixteen, shows \"signs of an actual plot\" and contains a \"sudden explosion of fan service\", which are noted as \"noteworthy developments\" in the review. In the fourth DVD, containing episodes seventeen through twenty-one, \"the series' romantic side does finally pay off with a romantic arc that actually engages\". In the fifth and final DVD containing the last five episodes, the Hikari and Amane relationship is described as lacking chemistry, although the Nagisa and Shizuma pairing is regarded as satisfying.\n\n\"Strawberry Panic!\" was one of the premier titles in the Light Novel and Strawberry (for yuri manga) production lines when it was licensed for English language distribution by Seven Seas Entertainment. In an interview with Seven Seas Entertainment founder Jason DeAngelis, he was posed the question, \"How do you attract a fan base for a novel before its release in English?\" His response was, \"We try to choose titles that are already well-known, like \"Pita-Ten\", \"Shinigami no Ballad\" or \"Strawberry Panic!\"...In terms of attracting a fan base, though, in the end it's all about word-of-mouth. If the material is great, it will stand out on its own and find its audience. The small format that we're publishing these books in is frankly stunning, and it will definitely attract fans who may not have heard of the property otherwise.\"\n\n\"Strawberry Panic! Girls' School in Fullbloom\" received a total review score of 26/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 6, 7, 7, and 6) from the Japanese gaming magazine \"Famitsu\". The game is listed by MediaWorks as one of their most-popular game titles.\n\n"}
{"id": "989858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=989858", "title": "Streaming television", "text": "Streaming television\n\nStreaming television (or streaming TV) is the digital distribution of television content, such as TV shows, as streaming video delivered over the Internet. Streaming TV stands in contrast to dedicated terrestrial television delivered by over-the-air aerial systems, cable television, and/or satellite television systems.\n\nThe mid 2000s were the beginning of television programs becoming available via the Internet. ITunes began offering select television programs and series in 2005, available for download after direct payment. The video-sharing site YouTube also launched in 2005 allowing users to share illegally posted television programs. A few years later television networks and other independent services began creating sites where shows and programs could be streamed online. Amazon Video began in the United States as Amazon Unbox in 2006, but did not launch worldwide until 2016. Netflix, a website originally created for DVD rentals and sales began providing streaming content in 2007. In 2008 Hulu, owned by NBC and Fox, was launched, followed by tv.com in 2009 and owned by CBS. Digital media players also began to become available to the public during this time. The first generation Apple TV was released in 2007 and in 2008 the first generation Roku streaming device was announced. Amazon's version of a digital media player, Amazon Fire TV, was not offered to the public until 2014. These digital media players have continued to be updated and new generations released. Access to television programming has evolved from computer and television access, to also include mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Apps for mobile devices started to become available via app stores in 2008. These mobile apps allow users to view content on mobile devices that support the apps. In 2017 YouTube launched YouTube TV, a streaming service that allows users to watch live television programs from popular cable or network channels, and record shows to stream anywhere, anytime. After 2010 traditional cable and satellite television providers began to offer services such as Sling TV, owned by Dish Network, which was unveiled in January 2015. DirecTV, another satellite television provider launched their own streaming service, DirecTV Now, in 2016. Smart TVs took over the television market after 2010. As of 2015 smart TVs are the only type of middle to high-end television being produced. As of 2017, 28% of US adults cite streaming services as their main means for watching television, and 61% of those ages 18 to 29 cite it as their main method. As of 2018, Netflix is the world's largest streaming TV network and also the world's largest Internet media and entertainment company with 117 million paid subscribers, and by revenue and market cap.\n\nThe Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) consortium of industry companies (such as SES, Humax, Philips, and ANT Software) is currently promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast and broadband digital television and multimedia applications with a single-user interface.\n\nAs of the 2010s, providers of Internet television use various technologies to provide VoD systems and live streaming. BBC iPlayer makes use of the Adobe Flash Player to provide streaming-video clips and other software provided by Adobe for its download service. CNBC, Bloomberg Television and Showtime use live-streaming services from BitGravity to stream live television to paid subscribers using the HTTP protocol.\n\nBBC iPlayer originally incorporated peer-to-peer streaming, moved towards centralized distribution for their video streaming services. BBC executive Anthony rose cited network performance as an important factor in the decision, as well as the unhappiness among consumers unhappy with their own network bandwidth being consumed for transmitting content to other viewers.\n\nSamsung TV has also announced their plans to provide streaming options including 3D Video on Demand through their Explore 3D service.\nSome streaming services incorporate digital rights management. The W3C made the controversial decision to adopt Encrypted Media Extensions due in large part to motivations to provide copy protection for streaming content. Sky Go has software that is provided by Microsoft to prevent content being copied.\n\nAdditionally, BBC iPlayer makes use of a parental control system giving parents the option to \"lock\" content, meaning that a password would have to be used to access it. Flagging systems can be used to warn a user that content may be certified or that it is intended for viewing post-watershed. Honour systems are also used where users are asked for their dates of birth or age to verify if they are able to view certain content.\n\nIPTV delivers television content using signals based on the Internet protocol (IP), through the open, unmanaged Internet with the \"last-mile\" telecom company acting only as the Internet service provider (ISP). As described above, \"Internet television\" is \"over-the-top technology\" (OTT). Both IPTV and OTT use the Internet protocol over a packet-switched network to transmit data, but IPTV operates in a closed system—a dedicated, managed network controlled by the local cable, satellite, telephone, or fiber-optic company. In its simplest form, IPTV simply replaces traditional circuit switched analog or digital television channels with digital channels which happen to use packet-switched transmission. In both the old and new systems, subscribers have set-top boxes or other customer-premises equipment that communicates directly over company-owned or dedicated leased lines with central-office servers. Packets never travel over the public Internet, so the television provider can guarantee enough local bandwidth for each customer's needs.\n\nThe Internet protocol is a cheap, standardized way to enable two-way communication and simultaneously provide different data (e.g., TV-show files, email, Web browsing) to different customers. This supports DVR-like features for time shifting television: for example, to catch up on a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago, or to replay the current TV show from its beginning. It also supports video on demand—browsing a catalog of videos (such as movies or television shows) which might be unrelated to the company's scheduled broadcasts.\n\nIPTV has an ongoing standardization process (for example, at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute).\n\nStream quality refers to the quality of the image and audio transferred from the servers of the distributor to the user's home screen. Higher-quality video such as video in high definition (720p+) requires higher bandwidth and faster connection speeds. The generally accepted kbit/s download rate needed to stream high-definition video that has been encoded with H.264 is 3500 kbit/s, whereas standard-definition television can range from 500 to 1500 kbit/s depending on the resolution on screen. In the UK, the BBC iPlayer deals with the largest amount of traffic yet it offers HD content along with SD content. As more people have gotten broadband connections which can deal with streaming HD video over the Internet, the BBC iPlayer has tried to keep up with demand and pace. However, as streaming HD video takes around 1.5 GB of data per hour of video the BBC has had to invest a lot of money collected from License Fee payers to implement this on a large scale.\n\nFor users who do not have the bandwidth to stream HD video or even high-SD video, which requires 1500 kbit/s, the BBC iPlayer offers lower bitrate streams which in turn lead to lower video quality. This makes use of an adaptive bitrate stream so that if the user's bandwidth suddenly drops, iPlayer will lower its streaming rate to compensate. A diagnostic tool offered on the BBC iPlayer site measures a user's streaming capabilities and bandwidth.\n\nIn the last few years , Channel 4 has started providing HD content on its On Demand platforms such as iOS App, Android App and Channel4.com website. Although competitors in the UK such as Demand Five have not yet offered HD streaming , the technology to support it is fairly new and widespread HD streaming is not an impossibility. The availability of Channel 4 and Five content on YouTube is predicted to prove incredibly popular as series such as \"Skins\", \"Green Wing\", \"The X Factor\" and others become available in a simple, straightforward format on a website which already attracts millions of people every day.\n\nInternet television is common in most US households as of the mid 2010s. About one in four new televisions being sold is now a smart TV.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Considering the vast popularity of smart TVs and devices such as the Roku and Chromecast, much of the US public can watch television via the internet. Internet-only channels are now established enough to feature some Emmy-nominated shows, such as Netflix's \"House of Cards\". Many networks also distribute their shows the next day to streaming providers such as Hulu Some networks may use a proprietary system, such as the BBC utilizes their iPlayer format. This has resulted in bandwidth demands increasing to the point of causing issues for some networks. It was reported in February 2014 that Verizon is having issues coping with the demand placed on their network infrastructure. Until long-term bandwidth issues are worked out and regulation such at net neutrality Internet Televisions push to HDTV may start to hinder growth.\n\nAereo was launched in March 2012 in New York City (and subsequently stopped from broadcasting in June 2014). It streamed network TV only to New York customers over the Internet. Broadcasters filed lawsuits against Aereo, because Aereo captured broadcast signals and streamed the content to Aereo's customers without paying broadcasters. In mid-July 2012, a federal judge sided with the Aereo start-up. Aereo planned to expand to every major metropolitan area by the end of 2013. The Supreme Court ruled against Aereo June 24, 2014.\n\nMany providers of Internet television services exist—including conventional television stations that have taken advantage of the Internet as a way to continue showing television shows after they have been broadcast, often advertised as \"on-demand\" and \"catch-up\" services. Today, almost every major broadcaster around the world is operating an Internet television platform. Examples include the BBC, which introduced the BBC iPlayer on 25 June 2008 as an extension to its \"RadioPlayer\" and already existing streamed video-clip content, and Channel 4 that launched 4oD (\"4 on Demand\") (now All 4) in November 2006 allowing users to watch recently shown content. Most Internet television services allow users to view content free of charge; however, some content is for a fee.\n\nSince 2012 around 200 over-the-top (OTT) platforms providing streamed and downloadable content have emerged. Investment by Netflix in new original content for its OTT platform reached $13bn in 2018.\n\nBroadcasting rights vary from country to country and even within provinces of countries. These rights govern the distribution of copyrighted content and media and allow the sole distribution of that content at any one time. An example of content only being aired in certain countries is BBC iPlayer. The BBC checks a user's IP address to make sure that only users located in the UK can stream content from the BBC. The BBC only allows free use of their product for users within the UK as those users have paid for a television license that funds part of the BBC. This IP address check is not foolproof as the user may be accessing the BBC website through a VPN or proxy server. Broadcasting rights can also be restricted to allowing a broadcaster rights to distribute that content for a limited time. Channel 4's online service All 4 can only stream shows created in the US by companies such as HBO for thirty days after they are aired on one of the Channel 4 group channels. This is to boost DVD sales for the companies who produce that media.\n\nSome companies pay very large amounts for broadcasting rights with sports and US sitcoms usually fetching the highest price from UK-based broadcasters. A trend among major content producers in North America is the use of the \"TV Everywhere\" system. Especially for live content, the TV Everywhere system restricts viewership of a video feed to select Internet service providers, usually cable television companies that pay a retransmission consent or subscription fee to the content producer. This often has the negative effect of making the availability of content dependent upon the provider, with the consumer having little or no choice on whether they receive the product.\n\nWith the advent of broadband Internet connections multiple streaming providers have come onto the market in the last couple of years. The main providers are Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Some of these providers such as Hulu advertise and charge a monthly fee. Other such as Netflix and Amazon charge users a monthly fee and have no commercials. Netflix is the largest provider; it has over 43 million members and its membership numbers are growing . The rise of internet TV has resulted in cable companies losing customers to a new kind of customer called \"cord cutters\". Cord cutters are consumers who are cancelling their cable TV or satellite TV subscriptions and choosing instead to stream TV shows, movies and other content via the Internet. Cord cutters are forming communities. With the increasing availability of video sharing websites (e.g., YouTube) and streaming services, there is an alternative to cable and satellite television subscriptions. Cord cutters tend to be younger people.\n\n"}

As commemorating the 30th anniversary of the launch of television information magazine \"TV Guide\" as an extra special issue (15 October Issue) it was issued (the front cover is \"TV Star Meikan\", on the back cover is \"TV Guide Rinji Zōkan: Heisei 4-nen 10 tsuki 15-nichi-gō '92 Tv Star Meikan\" notated with adifferent title).\n\nInitially it was combined with the publication year and title year, but the year of the title is set to the next fiscal year from \"TV Star Meikan '96\" (temporary extra publication 25 October issue) issued in 1995. Until the 1999 edition, the publication dates are October, 2000, 2006 to 2006, November 2007. Regarding the form of issue, the extra publication of \"TV Star Meikan '98\" \"TV Guide\" extra edition, \"TV Star Meikan 2000\" 'in 1999, \"TV Guide\" extra publication, 2000 \"TV Star Directory 2001\" are books of from the \"Tokyo News Mook\" Mook series.\n\nIts book size format is A5 size, the basic colour in the cover is blue (2000 edition only, 2001 edition only dark blue) or purple land (after 2002 edition), the body magazine is monochrome. A celebrity directory booklet will be posted as an appendix to the usual \"TV Guide\" from about July every year, but those summarized are released in late October or early November. In addition to celebrities (individuals, groups, children), cultural people, news presenters, and announcers are posted. Athletes were also posted at the beginning of its first publication (Thereafter, there were also times when K-1 players were posted as male stars).\n\nIn 2008, Web-ban TV Star Meikan has started as the website version of this directory. In addition, even the entertainer posted in the book version may not be posted on the web version due to circumstances of the rights. Also, some may not be published in the book version, some of the entertainers were posted only on the web version.\n\nIn its sister magazine there was the Fresh Star Meikan, a star map book of only young stars. It was launched in 1994 and it was released every March. Here the format is also A5 size.

It is also a sequel to the 2010 television sequel-series \"This Is England '86\", set two and a half years later and starring as previously Thomas Turgoose as Shaun, Vicky McClure as Lol and Joe Gilgun as Woody.\n\nSet during Christmas 1988, Lol is haunted by the devastating events that took place two and a half years before. She and Woody both find themselves struggling to cope with their lives without each other after he leaves the gang. Lol is carrying the burden of her guilt, whilst Woody is trying to build a domestic life with a new girlfriend and a potential promotion at work. Shaun has started at drama college and, although still in a relationship with Smell, he has grown close to a girl performing in his Christmas play.\n\n\nRonald \"Meggy\" Megford does not appear, his absence explained on Twitter by having died off-screen in 1987. This decision was apparently reversed as he briefly appears in This Is England '90.\n\nThe story takes place in late December 1988 with the first episode starting on 23 December. Lol is haunted by visions of her dead father Mick – whom she killed in the previous series when he tried to rape her – and is struggling to cope as a single parent with her young daughter, Lisa, who is a result of her affair with Milky two and a half years prior. Lol's affair has also led to Woody's self-imposed exile from the gang, but he has begun to rebuild his life. He has a new girlfriend, Jennifer, whom his parents adore, and has been offered a promotion at work. Smell and Shaun are still together, but growing distant. Shaun develops his creative side on a college drama course, and grows close to Fay, a girl performing in his Christmas play. Milky is welcomed back into the gang after spending some time away, but after Woody sees them together in the pub, old wounds re-appear.\n\nDespite Woody's misgivings about the responsibilities associated with a promotion, he is seemingly convinced after a dinner out with Jennifer and his boss. Lol turns to a religious, concerned paediatric nurse for help, and finally pays a visit to Combo in prison. She thanks him for having always been there to support her, and apologises for the way she treated him when he returned to the gang five and a half years prior. Shaun takes centre-stage for his acting debut, and Smell's suspicions are heightened when she walks in on him and Fay 'rehearsing' a kiss backstage before the performance. Fay has a party at her house to celebrate the success of the play, and Shaun finds her upstairs alone in her bedroom. The two talk about their growing feelings for each other and despite agreeing not to get any more serious, they are unable to control their passions and end up having sex. Smell arrives at Fay's house intending to apologise to Shaun for her jealousy earlier in the evening, but walks in on Shaun and Fay in bed. Smell angrily breaks up with Shaun and storms out, leaving him devastated.\n\nAs Christmas Eve turns to Christmas Day, Shaun is devastated after Smell caught him cheating at the after-show party. Mum Cynthia and Mr. Sandhu (now a surrogate father to Shaun) comfort Shaun and promise him that Smell will eventually forgive him.\n\nMeanwhile, most of the gang is out getting merry until they bump into Woody and Jennifer. It is revealed that Woody didn't find out about Lol and Milky's affair until the birth of a mixed-race daughter, Lisa. A distraught Woody, revealing he'd earlier attempted suicide, cannot control his rage and attacks Milky, who refuses to fight back or walk away. The others break up the fight and lead Milky away, with Woody repeatedly screaming how he loved Milky like a brother. Woody calls Milky a \"snake in the grass,\" repeating what Combo had accused Woody of being in 1983. Woody eventually realises he can never love Jennifer as much as he loved Lol, and they agree to end their relationship and remain friends.\n\nLol seeks solace in a midnight mass service, but it does not ease her pain, and she has visions of Mick again. Feeling unable to cope any longer, and consumed with guilt over Combo's prison sentence, Lol takes an overdose of Paracetamol. Trev and Kelly find her and rush her to the hospital where her stomach is pumped. Trev, after being unable to contact Woody by telephone, goes to his parents' house, where they are all opening Christmas presents. On hearing of Lol's suicide attempt, Woody rushes to the hospital, where he finds Lol's bed empty. He immediately thinks she has died, but Lol's mother and friends (including Milky) inform him that she is alive, doing well and is nearby having a smoke. Woody and Milky finally make up, and Woody goes to talk alone with Lol. She tells him about her emotional problems, and the truth about her father's murder. Visibly shaken, but touched by Combo's sacrifice, Woody tells Lol he still loves her and can't be with anyone else.\n\nThe episode ends with Woody and Lol in each other's arms, and then cuts to various members of the gang – including Combo in his prison cell, eating his Christmas meal with a plastic fork. Shaun is shown having Christmas dinner with his mother and Mr. Sandhu, but still miserable over losing Smell.\n\nWriting for \"The Guardian\", Euan Ferguson said that it \"was all phenomenal\" and \"roll on their next story\". Paddy Shennan writing for the \"Liverpool Echo\" also rated the series, calling it the best drama series of 2011. However, Hugh Montgomery writing for \"The Independent\" found all the misery \"increasingly irritating\". The series won the award for Best Mini Series at the 2012 BAFTA Television Awards, and also led to a Best Actor nomination for Joseph Gilgun (Woody) and a second successive Best Actress nomination for Vicky McClure (Lol).\n\n"}
{"id": "8827253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8827253", "title": "Toy safety", "text": "Toy safety\n\nToy safety is the practice of ensuring that toys, especially those made for children, are safe, usually through the application of set safety standards. In many countries, commercial toys must be able to pass safety tests in order to be sold. In the U.S., some toys must meet national standards, while other toys may not have to meet a defined safety standard. In countries where standards exist, they exist in order to prevent accidents, but there have still been some high-profile product recalls after such problems have occurred. The danger is often not due to faulty design; usage and chance both play a role in injury and death incidents as well.\n\nCommon scenarios include:\n\nAccidents involving toys are quite common, with 40,000 happening each year in the United Kingdom (according to 1998 figures - data has not been collected in the UK since 2003), accounting for less than 1% of annual accidents. In 2005 in the U.S., 20 children under 15 years of age died in incidents associated with toys, and an estimated 202,300 children under 15 were treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms for injuries associated with toys, according to data from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. In the European Union, no fatal accidents have been reported in the European Injury Database since 2002. In Europe, home and leisure data was examined concerning injuries caused by falls to a lower level among 0-4-year-olds from Austria, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands and Sweden. It was found that children′s use of several product categories was closely related to age. Children′s furniture account for between 21% (Netherlands) and 34% (Sweden) of the injuries from falls to a lower level in the first living year, but decreased with increasing age in all countries. The same pattern applied to strollers. In contrast, injuries due to falls involving playground equipment increased with age to reach between 13 (Greece) and 34 (Netherlands) percent of injuries from falls to a lower level among 4-year-olds. Bicycles also increase with age, reaching between 4 (Netherlands) and 17 (Denmark) percent among 4-year-olds.\n\nDistinction must be drawn between regulations and voluntary safety standards. From the table below, it can be seen that many regions model their safety standards on the EU's EN 71 standard, either directly, or through adoption of the ISO 8124 standard which itself is modelled on EN 71.\n\nIn Europe toys must meet the criteria set by the EC Toy Safety Directive (essentially that a toy be safe, which may be addressed by testing to European Standard EN71) in order for them to carry the CE mark. All European Union member states have transposed this directive into law - for example, the UK's Toy (Safety) Regulations 1995. Trading Standards Officers in the UK, similarly to appropriate authorities in the other EU member states, have the power to immediately demand the withdrawal of a toy product from sale on safety grounds via the RAPEX recall notification system (used for all products subject to European safety legislation). In Canada the government department Health Canada has the responsibility of ensuring product safety, just as the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) does in the United States. Australian and New Zealand toy safety standards (following the approximate model of the European Toy Safety Standard) have been adopted by the ISO as International Standard ISO 8124. Toy safety standards are continually updated and modified as the understanding of risks increases and new products are developed.\n\nManufacturers often display information about the intended age of the children who will play with the toy. In the U.S. this label is sometimes mandated by the CPSC, especially for toys which may present a choking hazard for children under three years of age. In most countries the intended age is either shown as a minimum age or as an age range. While one reason for this is the complexity of the toy and how much it will interest or challenge children of different ages, another is to highlight that it may be unsafe for younger children. While a toy might be \"suitable\" for children of one age, and thus this is the age \"recommended\" on the product, there may be safety hazards associated with use by a lower age group, necessitating a mandatory warning. Some manufacturers also explain the specific dangers next to the advised age (as is mandated by European and International toy safety standards EN71 and ISO 8124 respectively, but not US standard ASTM F963). Some accidents occur when babies play with toys intended for older children.\n\nIn August 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (\"CPSIA\") was passed. Some observers are of the opinion that this new law imposes the toughest toy-making standard in the world. The CPSIA restricts the amount of lead and phthalates that may be contained in children's products (ages 12 and under) and adopts the provisions of the \"ASTM Consumer Safety Specifications for Toy Safety\" (ASTM F963-11) as the requirements of the CPSC.\n\nIn 2012 the US state of Minnesota introduced its own legislation that requires reporting information on a list of priority chemicals found in children’s products and sold in the state. This law demands all manufacturers of toys to provide the state of Minnesota with a report if their children’s products contain any of the priority chemicals such as Bisphenol A, Formaldehyde, lead or cadmium.\n\nIn Europe, the comprehensive legislation addressing toy safety is \"the Toy Safety Directive\" of the European Union (EU), (Council Directive 88/378/EEC). This directive is a list of requirements toys must comply with, and is interpreted in the laws of each member state of the EU in their respective Toy Safety Regulations (e.g.: the UK's \"Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 (Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 204)\"). This directive has been superseded by Council Directive 2009/48/EC which will apply to toy imports into or toys produced within the EU as of 20 July 2011 except for the chemical requirements of Annex II which apply as of 20 July 2013. During these periods the corresponding requirements of the previous directive will continue to apply. Compliance with both directives leads to a CE Mark, which is a mandatory requirement denoting conformity with all applicable directives. Some items specifically excluded from this legislation are: fashion jewellery for children, Christmas decorations, and sports equipment. Official guidance on the classification of toys in the EU has been provided by the EU Commission. Where products are not classified as toys they will still be governed by the General Product Safety Directive. The toy safety directive provides for harmonised EU-wide standards on physical and mechanical properties, flammability, chemical properties and electrical properties but certain essential safety aspects of the directives are not governed by safety standards e.g. hygiene and radioactivity.\nThe Toys Safety Directive (and subsequent Member State regulations) also calls for the closest applicable national or international standards to be applied where a standard is not specified in the Directive. This interpretive clause is present to ensure that new and innovative toys are safe before being placed on the market. The EN71 Toy Safety Standard has been harmonised by the EC as the default standard which toys must meet.\nIf a toy is found to be unsafe (by breaching one of the specified standards, or by a manifest risk of injury not specified in standards) then the producer (the manufacturer, or the first importer into the EU of the product unit in question) is held to be guilty of an offence under the Toys (Safety) Regulations (or equivalent EU state law). The principle of \"due diligence\" (whereby the producer argues that all reasonable steps were taken to ensure the safety of the consumer with regards to the toy) may be used (in the UK) by the producer to avoid prosecution, fines and possible imprisonment. The unsafe toy is withdrawn from the EU market, with all member states' authorities being notified by means of the RAPEX alert system.\n\nThe new Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC (TSD) requires a series of safety assessments, including the Chemical Safety Assessment (CSA). If the non-chemical requirements were already enforced in July 2011, the chemical requirements are to be enforced first on 20 July 2013. In 2009, the European Union adopted the new Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC (TSD). The Comité Européen de Normalisation or CEN wrote these standards in order for them to be harmonized under the Toy Safety Directive. Official EU Guidance on the interpretation of the Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC exists and although non-binding, it has been agreed by a majority of EU Member States.\n\nChina's toy industry has been regulated since early 2007 by the expansion of the nation's compulsory certification system to include toy products.\nRegulations require a manufacturers to apply for China Compulsory Certification (CCC) from the nation's Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA). From 1 March, toy producers in China have been able to apply to three certification agencies nominated by the CNCA to certify their products. Toys are subject to inspection and certification review. Since 1 June 2007, no toy products without CCCs has been be allowed to leave factories, be sold or be imported into China. It is hoped this measure will mitigate the increasing international pressure on environmental protection, as well as further expand the nation's toy export market.\nThis increase in scrutiny was introduced before the 2007 Chinese export recalls.\n\nThe EU Commission expert group on toy safety regularly publishes a large number of guidance documents intended to help on interpretation issues related to the Toy Safety Directive. Toy manufacturers need stay ahead of regulatory changes and be sure that their products comply with the new requirements.\n\nTherefore, it is vital to perform tests and risk assessments for every product before selling them in the designated market. This is important for every manufacturer as they can be held liable for injuries and fatalities resulting from design flaws, use of unsuitable materials, and substandard production.\n\nThe following safety tests are performed:\n\nProduct safety/risk assessment (also known as product hazard analysis) can identify potential hazards and provide solutions early in the product life cycle to prevent products becoming stalled in production or recalled once they are released onto the market. During risk assessments for toys possible hazards and potential exposure are analyzed. Additionally the manufacturing of the toys will be controlled to ensure safety and quality throughout production.\n\nThe new European standard EN 71-4:2013 was published in 2013. It replaces and updates the 2009 version of the same standard since the latter and newest has been harmonized under the EU Toy Safety Directive. The new method is a reference test method regulating chemicals in toys and juvenile products. This gives a new test method for 'Experimental sets for chemistry and related activities' under the toy safety EN 71 series.\n\nInternational commerce plays a big role in toy safety. In the first four months of 2006, China exported US$4 billion worth of toys. The United States contributed 70 percent of the global market by exporting US$15.2 billion in toys in 2005. The European Union accounts for 75% of the final disposition of these toys. From January 2005 through September 2006, products originating in China were responsible for about 48 percent of product recalls in the U.S., and a similar percentage of notifications in the EU. Lack of process control in sub-contracted vendors has been a contributing factor in recent high-profile cases.\n\nAlthough an international toy safety standard exists, nations around the world still create their own legislation and standards to address the issue.\nCurrent toy safety standards focus on design principles and rely on batch testing of samples to assure safety. As has been seen in the large scale recalls of 2007, sample testing can miss non-conforming product. A design may be conceptually safe, but without control of the production, the design may not be met by the manufacturer. Similarly, the applicable toy safety standards to which a toy is tested by a laboratory may not discover a hazard in a product: in the case of 2007's magnetic toy recalls and the Bindeez recall, the products in question met the requirements laid down in the applicable safety standard, yet were found to present an inherent risk.\nProposed process and quality control standards, similar to the ISO 9000 systems, seek to eliminate production errors and control materials to avoid deviation from the design.\nThe creation of manufacturing quality standards for toys will help ensure consistency of production. Using a continual improvement model, production can be subject to constant scrutiny, rather than assuming the compliance of all production by testing random samples.\nIn October and November 2007, mandatory third party testing by companies such as LGA, Eurofins, Bureau Veritas or SGS Consumer Testing Services was proposed by regulators in the EU and US, to a (possibly new) international standard, requiring a new safety mark. There is no indication that the proposals will address manufacturing control.\n\nThe ability to recall a product from the market is a necessary part of any safety legislation. If existing quality and safety checks fail to detect an issue prior to sale, a systematic method of notifying the public and removing potentially hazardous products from the market is needed.\nSome toys have been discovered to have been unsafe after they have been placed on the market. Before the introduction of safety monitoring organisations the toys were simply stopped being manufactured if any action was taken at all, but since then there have been many toys that have been recalled by their manufacturer. In some notable cases the problem has only been found after the injury or even death of a person that purchased the product.\n\nChoking is the number one reason for accidents, but chemicals such as lead can also cause developmental problems like behavioral disorders and sickness. Exposure to lead can affect almost every organ and system in the human body, especially the central nervous system. Lead is especially toxic to the brains of young children. In the US, the CPSC and Customs and Border Protection are responsible for screening children's products imported into the country. Just less than 10% of products screened are stopped for violations. Nearly two thirds are stopped for lead violations and 15% are stopped for choking hazards.\n\nIn the United Kingdom toys are regulated by the Toy Product Safety Regulations 1995 which require that toys must not be sold if they do not have the correct safety labels.\n\nBatches of Bindeez were recalled in November 2007 after several children swallowed beads and were adversely affected. Upon ingestion, a chemical used in the product metabolized in the stomach into the sedative drug, GHB. The design called for a different, non-toxic chemical, but this had been substituted with an alternative chemical, which had approximately the same functional properties. The name was changed to \"Beados\" in 2008.\n\nThe Cabbage Patch Kids dolls were very popular in the 1980s across North America and many parts of Europe. The \"Cabbage Patch Kids Snacktime Kids\" line of dolls were an early 1990s incarnation designed to \"eat\" plastic snacks. The mechanism was a pair of one-way metal rollers behind a plastic slot and rubber lips, and there were 35 reported incidents in which a child's hair or finger was caught in the mouths. On 31 December 1996, after 700,000 dolls were distributed in the United States in just five months, the CPSC along with manufacturers Mattel announced that they would place warning information labels on all unsold dolls. A week later, in January 1997, CPSC and Mattel announced that all Cabbage Patch Kids Snacktime Kids were being removed from the market.\n\nLawn darts are large, weighted darts intended to be tossed underhand towards a horizontal ground target. On 19 December 1988, all lawn darts were banned from sale in the United States by the Consumer Product Safety Commission after they were responsible for the deaths of three children since 1970. In 1989, they were also banned in Canada.\n\nOne death and four serious injuries led to the recall of 3.8 million Magnetix building sets in March 2006. The magnets inside the plastic building pieces could fall out and be swallowed or aspirated.\nIn 2009, Avolio L and Martucciello G published on The New England Journal of Medicine the effects of magnetic toys ingestion in two children (\"Ingested Magnets\".Luigi Avolio, M.D., and Giuseppe Martucciello, M.D. N Engl J Med 2009; 360:2770 June 25, 2009)\nSince then MEGA Brands has implemented design enhancements to Magnetix, including sonic welding of panels, 100% inspection, gluing magnets into rods, elimination of 3+ labeling in favor of 6+ labeling after it assumed operational control of Rose Art on 1 January 2006. Only safe and improved products are currently on store shelves.\n\nIn November 2006 4.4 million Polly Pocket Quik-Clik sets were recalled by Mattel after children in the United States swallowed loose magnetic parts. The toys had been sold around the world commencing three years previous.\n\nClackers were discontinued when reports came out of children becoming injured while playing with them and after a ruling in United States v. Article Consisting of 50,000 Cardboard Boxes More or Less, Each Containing One Pair of Clacker Balls that they were hazards in the United States. Fairly heavy and fast-moving, and made of hard acrylic plastic, the balls would occasionally shatter upon striking each other.\n\nThe CSPC issued a voluntary Razor scooter recall, specifically targeting the Razor PowerWing three-wheeled scooters. Around 103,000 Razor scooters were affected by this recall. The reason for the Razor scooter recall is that the underside of the foot platform can have sharp edges, thus leading to a laceration hazard to kids who are riding the vehicle.\n\nUsing the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (http://www.cpsc.gov/LIBRARY/data.html) figures the number of annual reported child toy-related deaths and injuries, compared with CPSC expenditure and total toy sales in the US by year are tabulated below.\n\n†Amount no longer given but combined with other categories—this is sometimes done to give an agency added flexibility; however, at times this is done to falsely show an increase in funding when there is no way to assess how much will be spent for a specific task.\n\nAnnual CPSC Reports to Congress containing toy-related emergency room injuries and deaths.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "512539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=512539", "title": "World tree", "text": "World tree\n\nThe world tree is a motif present in several religions and mythologies, particularly Indo-European religions, Siberian religions, and Native American religions. The world tree is represented as a colossal tree which supports the heavens, thereby connecting the heavens, the terrestrial world, and, through its roots, the underworld. It may also be strongly connected to the motif of the tree of life, but it is the source of wisdom of the ages.\n\nSpecific world trees include \"égig érő fa\" in Hungarian mythology, Ağaç Ana in Turkic mythology, Modun in Mongol mythology, \"Yggdrasil\" (or \"Irminsul\") in Germanic (including Norse) mythology, the oak in Slavic, Finnish and Baltic, Iroko in Yoruba religion, \"Jianmu\" in Chinese mythology, and in Hindu mythology the \"Ashvattha\" (a \"Ficus religiosa\").\n\n\nA common theme in most indigenous cultures of the Americas is a concept of directionality (the horizontal and vertical planes), with the vertical dimension often being represented by a world tree. Some scholars have argued that the religious importance of the horizontal and vertical dimensions in many animist cultures may derive from the human body and the position it occupies in the world as it perceives the surrounding living world. Many Indigenous cultures of the Americas have similar cosmologies regarding the directionality and the world tree, however the type of tree representing the world tree depends on the surrounding environment. For many Indigenous American peoples located in more temperate regions for example, it is the spruce rather than the ceiba that is the world tree; however the idea of cosmic directions combined with a concept of a tree uniting the directional planes is similar.\n\nThe world tree is widespread in Lithuanian folk painting, and is frequently found carved into household furniture such as cupboards, towel holders, and laundry beaters.\n\nThe world tree ( - \"Tree of Dawn\") also was one of the most important beliefs in Latvian mythology.\n\nIn the Iranian mythology, Gaokerena or white Haoma, is a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in universe. Bas tokhmak is another world tree with remedial attribute, it's retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow. World tree is a common motif in ancient art of Iran.\n\nThe Tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the Tree of life are both components of the Garden of Eden story in the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible. According to Jewish mythology, in the Garden of Eden there is a tree of life or the \"tree of souls\" that blossoms and produces new souls, which fall into the Guf, the \"Treasury of Souls\". The Angel Gabriel reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. Then Lailah, the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born.\n\nIn Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is the world tree. Yggdrasil is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Yggdrasil is an immense ash tree that is central and considered very holy. The Æsir go to Yggdrasil daily to hold their courts. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations; one to the well Urðarbrunnr in the heavens, one to the spring Hvergelmir, and another to the well Mímisbrunnr. Creatures live within Yggdrasil, including the harts Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór, the giant in eagle-shape Hræsvelgr, the squirrel Ratatoskr and the wyrm Níðhöggr. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the etymology of the name \"Yggdrasil\", the potential relation to the trees Mímameiðr and Læraðr, and the sacred tree at Uppsala.\n\nThe world tree is also represented in the mythologies and folklore of North Asia and Siberia. In the mythology of the Samoyeds, the world tree connects different realities (underworld, this world, upper world) together. In their mythology the world tree is also the symbol of Mother Earth who is said to give the Samoyed shaman his drum and also help him travel from one world to another.\n\nThe symbol of the world tree is also common in Tengrism, an ancient religion of Mongols and Turkic peoples.\n\nThe world tree is visible in the designs of the Crown of Silla, Silla being one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. This link is used to establish a connection between Siberian peoples and those of Korea.\n\nRemnants are also evident in the Kalpavriksha (\"wish-fulfilling tree\") and the Ashvattha tree of the South Asian religions.\n\nIn Brahma Kumaris religion, the World Tree is portrayed as the \"Kalpa Vriksha Tree\", or \"Tree of Humanity\", in which the founder Brahma Baba (Dada Lekhraj) and his Brahma Kumaris followers are shown as the roots of the humanity who enjoy 2,500 years of paradise as living deities before trunk of humanity splits and the founders of other religions incarnate. Each creates their own branch and brings with them their own followers, until they too decline and split. Twig like schisms, cults and sects appear at the end of the Iron Age.\n\nSome scholars suggest that the world tree is programmed into the human mind by evolutionary biology. Theory suggests that human beings are primates, and lived in trees for around 60 million years. The idea of a vast tree as the entirety of the world is thus still implanted in our collective unconscious.\n\n\n\n\n"}
