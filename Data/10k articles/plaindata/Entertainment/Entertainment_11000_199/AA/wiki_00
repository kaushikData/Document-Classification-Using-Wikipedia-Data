The goal is to attack the Japanese air fleet that bombed the American aircraft carrier, pursue all Japanese air and sea forces, fly through the 16 stages of play, and make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 of these stages consist of an air-to-sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as the stage boss), while 5 stages consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese bombers with a mother bomber at the end.\n\nAs in \"1942\", players pilot a P-38 Lightning. Controls are also similar: button 1 fires main weapons, and button 2 performs two special actions: a loop maneuver like in \"1942\", or one of three special lightning attacks in exchange for some of the player's fuel. Indeed, players now have only one life, in the form of a large \"fuel\" meter; constantly depleting, but refillable by collecting various powerups (chiefly \"Pow\" icons). In 2-player mode, when both players overlap their planes on screen, the energy bar can be transferred from the player with more fuel to the player with less. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a new main weapon.\n\nThere are cheat codes, different for every stage, ranging from holding down a fire button or pointing the joystick in a certain direction; player(s) are rewarded with fully upgraded weapons.\n\nCapcom released their own port for the NES, but the game has also been ported to the Atari ST, the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, the Commodore 64 and the Amiga. In 1998 it was rereleased as \"Capcom Generation 1\" for the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation. In it was re–released for Xbox and PlayStation 2 as part of \"Capcom Classics Collection\", and again in \"\" on the PlayStation Portable. It also included as the initial game in \"Capcom Arcade Cabinet\", a compilation of games released digitally for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on February 19, 2013 in which the games are sold individually or in packs. The overall faithfulness and quality of execution of these third party versions varies greatly.\n\nReleased exactly one year after the arcade version, the NES version of \"1943\" introduced the ability to improve the player's plane by permanently upgrading certain aspects of its abilities. These include the plane's offensive and defensive powers, the maximum fuel level, and its special weapons and their durations. This somewhat alters the game balance and a different tactic is required to survive the game. For example, initially very few weapons are made available; more can be attained from power-ups by putting statistic points into \"special weapons ability\".\n\nDeveloped and released alongside the Family Computer version, is an arcade game, an \"alternate\" version of the original \"1943\", released in 1987 in Japan. In USA, it was released as \"1943: The Battle of Midway Mark II\" . Most of the graphics and sounds have been reworked, and the game has been made more \"extreme\" (laser-firing World War II planes and ships that run on ground). Further, the trademark P-38 has been replaced with a Boeing Stearman E75 N68828.\n\nIn 1991, this version was converted to the PC Engine as simply \"1943 Kai\", again exclusively in Japan; this version contains many additional levels and original music.\n\nAlthough the arcade release was exclusive to Japan, the arcade version itself was included in the 1998 \"Capcom Generations\" for the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation and in the 2005 \"Capcom Classics Collection\" for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.\n\n"}

{"id": "57579527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57579527", "title": "Bauernschnapsen", "text": "Bauernschnapsen\n\nThe card game of Bauernschnapsen (also called \"Viererschnapsen\") is an expanded form of the popular Austrian card game of Schnapsen, played by four players. This variant of Schnapsen is played throughout the whole of Austria.\n\nBauernschnapsen is played with a 20-card packet of Schnapsen cards by two teams of two, the partners sitting opposite one another across the card table. Team membership may be renounced, but none of the players may use their experience of which cards their partner has in their hand, and they also do not known which cards he has. The aim is to win 24 points and the game ends as soon as one team has achieved that. In regional variants, scores start at 24 and count down to null (zero) points and the team that reaches null first is the winner. the losing team receives a \"Bummerl\". If the losing team scores no points, it receives a \"Schneider\", which counts as two \"Bummerls\". If a team leads 23:0 and loses it receives a \"Retourschneider\" (or \"Schuster\", \"Rücker\"), which counts as four \"Bummerls\". Another rule is that the first trick of each team must remain visible to all the players for the whole game, irrespective of the type of game being played.\n\nThe same cards are used as for other variants of Schnapsen: either French suited or German suited cards (William Tell pattern). There are 4 suits: in French playing cards and \"doppeldeutsche\" (William Tell pattern) cards they are Hearts (\"Herz\"), Diamonds (\"Karo\"), Spades (\"Pik\") and Clubs (\"Kreuz\" or, regionally, \"Treff\"). In the \"doppeldeutsche\" variants the suits are regionally also known as Hearts (\"Herz\"), Bells (\"Schelle\"), Leaves (\"Blatt\", \"Grün\" or \"Laub\") and Acorns (\"Eichel\"). There are five different cards per suit:\n\nIn each suit there are five cards: the Ace (\"Ass\") (regionally the Deuce or \"Daus\"), the 10, the King, the Ober (or the \"Dame\", regionally \"Manderl\") and the Unter (or the \"Bube\", regional \"Bauer\").\n\nThe dealer shuffles the card deck and the player to his right cuts the deck at least once or 'knocks' with his fist on the deck to indicate he is happy not to cut. Next three cards are dealt to each player in clockwise order, beginning with the player on the dealer's left, the caller (\"Rufer\"). The caller must choose a trump suit (\"Trumpffarbe\" or, regionally, \"Atoutfarbe\") from his first three cards, before receiving the remaining two cards. Then each player is dealt a packet of two more cards in the same order. If the caller cannot or will not decided which suit will be trumps, he can draw one of the two remaining cards and turn it over for everyone to see; the suit of this card is then the trump suit. If the player right of the dealer has knocked on the card deck, each player is given all five cards at once in the same clockwise order. The caller is initially dealt three, in order to decide the trump suit, and then a further two.\n\nThe trump suit beats all other cards in most cases. If the first three cards that the caller is dealt consists of three \"Unters\" (regionally \"Buben\" or \"Bauern\"), he may insist that the cards are reshuffled and redealt.\n\nAfter the caller has called trumps, the player who has bid the highest contract, may play it. In one regional variant, the caller must first decide whether to bid a contract or to pass; in the latter case the next player to the left (clockwise) has the right to bid a contract or pass.\n\nIn several contracts that may be declared, the declared trump suit becomes irrelevant and all suits are deemed equal in rank. Within a suit, the higher card beats the lower, and only cards of the trump suit may beat cards of a different suit. If a player e.g. plays an Unter of Leaves, a King or a Deuce (Ace) of another colour cannot beat it, but only be discarded (\"zugegeben\") – with the exception of the trump suit if trumps are valid.\n\nAt the end of each hand the caller becomes the dealer; he shuffles, lets the player to the right cut or knock and deals the cards as described above.\n\nWhich special contracts are permitted, varies to some extent from region to region. It is common to have the Schnapser, the Gang (or \"Gangl\") and the Bauernschnapser (\"Bauer\"). The \"Bettler\" contracts are very controversial in conservative circles, because they make normal games the exception rather than the rule.\n\nIf no contract is bid, a 'normal game' (\"normales Spiel\") is played, sometimes called a \"Rufer\" ('caller'), whereby the caller plays the first card. The aim is, together with one's partner, to score 66 card points or to win the last trick. If the losing team does not win a single trick, the winning team scores 3 game points. If the losing team score fewer than 33 points, the winning team gets 2 game points. If the losing team scores 33 or more, the winning team just gets one game point.\n\nIn Bauernschnapsen players must follow suit and attempt to win the trick, as in \"Zweierschnapsen\", once the talon has been used up or after it has been closed (\"zugedreht\"):\n\nThe player who wins the trick must lead to the next trick unless his team won the game as a result of winning the trick.\n\nIf a player, whose turn it is, has a King and an Ober (regionally \"Mandl\" or \"Ober\") of the same suit, he may declare a \"Zwanziger\" (\"Twenty-er\"), which wins 20 points. If the King and Ober are of the trump suit, he may declare a \"Vierziger\" (\"Forty-er\") and win 40 points. One of the two cards must be played, usually the Ober is chosen. They must win the trick when they can. If the team gets no tricks in the same game, the Twenty-ers and Forty-ers do not count. If the team wins at least one trick, the Twenty-ers and Forty-ers count even if the tricks were won by the other team.\n\nThe aim of Bettler (\"Beggar\") or, regionally, Fechter (\"Swordsman\") is not to take any tricks. All suits are equal. As in all the contracts, players must follow suit and try to win the trick. In one regional variant the partner of the player who has announced Bettler is not allowed to play and must take a pause. The winning team scores 4 points.\n\nIn Schnapser or Drei-Stich (\"Three Trick\") only the caller can declare and he must play the first card. If anyone beats his card, the team loses. If his own partner beats the caller's card, the game is also lost. The game is won in one of the following ways:\n\n\nThe caller does not have to decide which of these options to go for before the start of the Schnapser game, but just says \"I'll play a Schnapser\" (\"Ich spiele einen Schnapser\").\n\nThere is an uncommon regional variant in which the partner is allowed to win a trick, known as \"Schnapser mit Mann\". The winning team scores 6 points.\n\nA Gang (regionally \"Gangl\", \"Durchmarsch\", \"Land\", \"Ringerl\", \"Ring\" or \"Neuner\") may be announced by any player. All suits are the same value. The aim is to take all the tricks. The one who declares Gang plays the first card. If the declarer's partner takes a trick the game is lost. The winning team gets 9 points.\n\nAs in Gang the aim is to take all the tricks. Unlike Gang, however, the trump suit announced by the caller counts, so it is difficult for players other than the caller to declare this contract. The winning team scores 12 points.\n\nThe Kontraschnapser (\"Counter-Schnapser\") or Kontra-Drei-Stich (\"Counter-Three Tricks\") can be played by an opponent of the caller. The trump suit declared by the caller counts, the caller starts and the declarer must win the game.\n\nThe game may be won in the following ways:\n\nThe winning team scores 12 points. \nIn a regional variant the caller's partner can announce \"Schnapser together\" (\"Schnapser zusammen\") which may win 6 points.\n\nFarbringerl is also called Herrengangl or Farbensolo. If a player has all five cards of one suit, he may declare Farbringerl. Atout does not apply. It earns exactly 18 points.\nBecause this game is won (or lost) by declaring, even though it is impossible that the opposing players could beat them, it is usual that the game is won by placing the cards on the table. Because this special contract, as explained, cannot be played out, many clubs exclude this contract from their 'contract catalogue for 4-player Bauernschnapsen.\n\nKontrabauernschnapser is similar to Bauernschnapser: the aim is to take all the tricks, the trump suit being named by the caller. The caller plays the first card and the declarer must win all the tricks.\nThe winning team scores 24 points; thus the game is ended by a Kontrabauernschnapser.\n\nIf the caller holds all the cards of the \"Atout\" suit, he may declare a Herrenschnapser. This game counts for 24 points. Like Farbenring this special contract cannot be played out. As a result many clubs exclude it from their 'contract catalogue for 4-player Bauernschnapsen.\n\nIf the opposing team believes that the declarer will lose the game, they can double the stakes (known as \"spritzen\" or, regionally, \"flecken\", \"schießen\" or \"kontern\"). The contract is then worth double points. With the announcement \"Retour\" or \"Kontra\" or \"Zruckgspritzt\" the player (or his partner) may double it again, if he is nevertheless sure that they can win the game. This can be responded to again with the declaration \"Re\" or \"nuamoi zruckgspritzt\", whereupon a win would bring eight times the actual number of points - but this kind of thing does not happen very often. Every contract can be \"gefleckt\", both normal ones as well as special contracts.\n\nIf the team that is leading could reach zero, their opponents will often call \"auf Stand\", regardless of the quality of their own hands. They do this because doubling makes no difference if the team loses, but if they are lucky it may increase their chances of winning.\n\nAs in Bettler the aim of Assenbettler (regionally \"Zehnerloch\"), is not to take any tricks, all suits having the same value. As in all other contracts, it is compulsory to follow suit and win the trick if possible. The ace/deuce becomes the lowest card, so that the sequence is: 10, King, Ober, Unter, Ace/Deuce. The winning team scores five points.\n\nAs in Bettler and Assenbettler the aim of Ass-Bettler (regionally \"Ass-Fechter\") is not to take any tricks, all suits being equal in value. As in all other contracts, it is compulsory to follow suit and win the trick if possible. The player who announces Ass-Bettler must have at least one ace in his hand which makes it more difficult for him not to take a trick. The team that wins Ass-Bettler scores five points.\n\nThere is no special contract in Bauernschnapsen that is played so differently from round to round and from region to region as Plauderer.\n\n(a) Like Bettler/Fechter, where the opposing players may team up before the first game (they may look at each others' the cards). If the player succeeds in not taking a single trick, the team receives 7 points.\n\n(b) Like Bettler/Fechter, with the opposing players laying their cards face up in front of them after the first trick and the game being continued without the players communicating with each other.\n\n(c) Like Bettler/Fechter, with the declarer laying his cards face up in front of him after the first trick, but the opposing players keeping their cards hidden and continuing the game without the players communicating with each other.\n\nAs in Gang, the goal is to take all the tricks, all suits being equal. The ace is the lowest card, so the order of rank is: Tens, King, Ober, Unter, Ace. Zehnergang is not always an option in all areas and is therefore one of the special regional contracts in Bauernschnapsen. Therefore it should be clarified before the beginning of the game whether Zehnergang is allowed. There are two regional differences:\n\n\nThe winning team scores 10 points.\n\nBauernloch is a combination of Bauernschnapsen and Zehnerloch (or Zehnerloch, Zehnerhitten, Zehnerland). As in Zehnergang, the aim is to win all the tricks, but the exception that invalidates the trump is not used. Like Bauernschnapsen, trump cards keep their higher position. The increased difficulty of this contract is reflected in the points. Bauernloch can only be played by the person who chose the trump suit. He must take all the tricks and, if successful, wins 12 points.\n\nTalonschnapsen is also called Dreierschnapsen. The basic rules are the same as Bauernschnapsen, but there are only 3 players and thus it is a 'cut throat' game rather than a partnership game. Each player has a hand of 6, not 5, cards, the two remaining cards form the talon.\n\nThe dealer deals 3 cards to each player; the forehand, left of the dealer, calls the Atout, then 2 cards are placed face down as a talon (hence the name), then a further 3 cards are dealt to each player.\n\nThe bidding of a contract is as in normal Bauernschnapsen, beginning with the caller of the Atout. The player who bids the highest contract may now pick up the talon and must replace two cards again. If no-one bids a contract, a normal game is played, as described above, in which case the caller may look at the talon and, if he wants, exchange the talon cards for two of his own. Either way, the cards remain face down on the table.\n\nIn addition to the possibility to raise the originally announced game, there are two rules, which are handled differently regionally and which should therefore be clarified before the game starts. First, the caller (who announced a contract first) can raise it again before picking up the talon, if one of his teammates has bid a higher contract than his. Example: Caller (player A) bids a Schnapser, B passes, but C bids a higher contract. A hopes that the \"right\" cards are in the talon - and now raises to a Bauernschnapser. The other rule, which is not generally valid, refers to raising after picking up the hand: one of the players has \"prevailed\" with his contract, looks at the talon and thus gets a hand that allows him a higher contract, so now he announces this contract (before playing the first card, of course!). If a normal game is played, the caller could announce another contract in this case.\n\nIf the talon is not needed, you can also play without talon cards. When two players call out a contract, the player who can play without the talon cards has the precedence.\n\nWhoever then plays his announcement must now win his game against the other two.\n\nPoints: If the player finishes his declared game, he alone gets the points, if he doesn't win, each of the other two get the points. The game also ends here at 24 points. There is always a \"Bummerl\" or \"Schneider\", who has the fewest points of the three, if two players have the same number of points, both have a \"Bummerl\" or \"Schneider\".\nRegional variant: Any player who does not reach 24 points has a \"Bummerl\" - this can even happen if you win a game with your partner.\nFlecken is also possible in Talonschnapsen: a \"flecken\", \"spritzen\" or \"schießen\" may not be rescinded one it has been announced. It can be announced until the first card has been played, regardless of whether the talon has been viewed or not!\nIn a normal game, the caller must win at least 66 points; the talon cards are not counted along with the tricks he has won.\n\nThe announced contracts do not differ except for the Schnapser and Farbenring from those of the 4-player or Bauernschnapsen. Schnapser in Talonschnapsen consists of 4 tricks, in order to win the 12 cards, which can also be achieved in Bauernschnapsen. In double games, the talon is given to the person calling the figure, the atout caller leads and plays against the figure with the third player. In Farbenring, the player has all 5 cards of a certain suit and must make all 6 tricks.\n\n\n"}

Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions. Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of fiction-writing modes and their uses. Some writing modes suggested include action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, description, background, exposition and transition.\n\nThe concept goes back at least as far as Aristotle who, in \"Poetics\", referred to narration and action as different modes or manner of representing something. For many years, fiction writing was described has having two types: narration and dialogue. Evan Marshall, in \"The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing\" (1998) noted that writers should know what they are doing at all times. He described what he called \"fiction-writing modes\"—the types of writing of which all fiction is made. He listed five modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background, each with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.\n\n\n\n\nIn \"Poetics\", Aristotle mentions narration as a mode, or manner of representing something. As a fiction-writing mode, narration is how the narrator communicates directly to the reader. This contrasts with the use of the term \"narration\" as a rhetorical mode of discourse, where it has a broader meaning which encompasses all written fiction.\n\nDescription is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story. Together with dialogue, narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes. Description is more than the amassing of details, it is bringing a scene to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.\n\nBroadly defined, exposition is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. Within the context of fiction-writing modes, exposition is used to convey information. Exposition may be used to add drama to a story, but too much exposition at one time may slow the pace of the story.\n\nSummarization, or narrative summary, condenses events to convey, rather than to show, what happens within a story. The \"tell\" in the axiom \"Show, don't tell\" is often in the form of summarization. Summarization may be used to:\n\n\nThe main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space than other fiction-writing modes. Effective use of summarization requires a balance between showing and telling, action and summary, with rhythm, pace and tone playing a role.\n\nIntrospection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, or self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey the thoughts of a character, allowing the expression of normally unexpressed thoughts. Introspection may also be used to:\n\nRecollection is the fiction-writing mode whereby a character remembers a detail or event. It plays a vital role in conveying backstory by allowing writers to convey information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story. Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct mode of fiction-writing, it is a common tool. Recollection could be considered a subset of introspection, but its role in developing backstory separates it from the other thoughts of a character. Effective presentation of recollection has its own unique issues and challenges. For example, timing a recollection to avoid implausible-seeming memories (such as when a character must make a key decision) can be difficult, and should be prompted by a recent plot event.\n\nSensation is used to portray a character's perceptions. It can help draw the reader in by conveying the actual sensations of things comprising the story, breathing life into its physical world. Since the reader has experienced only a portion of the sensations experienced by the character, the author aims to either provoke recall from the reader, or convey the experience, drawing the reader in and maintaining interest in the story.\n\nThe fiction-writing mode of emotion conveys the feelings of the character, and is a vital component of creative writing. Connecting the character to his own emotions allows the author to connect with the reader on an emotional level.\n\nIn \"Poetics\", Aristotle refers to action as a mode, or manner of representing something. Action is the demonstration of events as they are happening in a story, and may help readers feel as if they were participating in the plot.\n\nTransitions in fiction are words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or punctuation that may be used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, point-of-view character, mood, tone, emotion, and pace.\n\nFiction-writing modes may be classified into categories of modes with common features. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "371532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371532", "title": "Forward the Foundation", "text": "Forward the Foundation\n\nForward the Foundation is a novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, published posthumously in 1993. It is the second of two prequels to the \"Foundation\" Series. It is written in much the same style as the original novel \"Foundation\", a novel composed of chapters with long intervals in between. Both books were first published as independent short stories in science fiction magazines.\n\nThe parallels between Hari Seldon and Isaac Asimov found in this book— the last one written by Asimov before his death— and the focus on Hari Seldon as he grows old and dies, strengthen the idea that Asimov considered Seldon his literary alter ego. Critics such as Josh Wimmer and Alasdair Wilkins have regarded many of the opinions and viewpoints expressed by Seldon in this book as autobiographical. Thus, a detailed reading of \"Forward the Foundation\" can shed light on Asimov's inner thoughts at the end of his life.\n\nLike other previous science fiction works by Asimov, the book was a commercial success, becoming a \"New York Times\" bestselling work.\n\n\"Forward the Foundation\" continues the chronicles of the life of Hari Seldon, first begun in \"Prelude to Foundation\". \nThe story takes place on Trantor, and begins eight years after the events of \"Prelude to Foundation\". It depicts how Seldon develops his theory of psychohistory from hypothetical concept to practical application.\n\nIn the latter years of the reign of Emperor Cleon I, Seldon is dragged into the world of galactic politics as Cleon's somewhat unwilling First Minister, after the resignation of his predecessor, Eto Demerzel (whom Seldon knows as the robot R. Daneel Olivaw). After the Emperor is assassinated, a military junta takes over for a disastrous decade. Seldon steps down from his government position and resumes leadership of the psychohistory project. \n\nSeldon and others, most notably Yugo Amaryl, finally develop psychohistory to the point that he can initiate what will come to be known as the Seldon Plan, the road map for drastically shortening the interregnum between the First and Second Empires.\n\nGradually, Seldon loses all those who are close to him. Seldon's consort Dors is killed (or rather destroyed) in an internal plot by an ambitious member of Seldon's own group. His adopted son Raych emigrates with his wife and a daughter to Santanni, though his elder daughter Wanda remains with Seldon. When a rebellion against the Empire breaks out, Raych sends his wife and daughter away on a starship, but he remains behind to defend his university and is killed, and the starship is never seen again. Yugo Amaryl, the second best psychohistory researcher (after Seldon himself), dies in middle age, worn out by his work. Except for his granddaughter Wanda, Seldon is alone in his fight to keep the project going in the face of the Galactic Empire's accelerating decline and lessening government support. \n\nWanda turns out to be what Seldon calls a \"mentalic\": someone who can read minds and actually influence people. (Seldon suspects that her father Raych's great likeability is a subconscious use of the same power.) They are able to find a few other mentalics, enabling Seldon to set up a second guardian for the Seldon Plan. Eventually, he sends Wanda and the others to another star system to establish the Second Foundation in secret. While the public First Foundation concentrates on the physical sciences, the hidden Second's psychohistorians will develop the mental ones.\n\n"}
{"id": "547452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=547452", "title": "Gridiron football", "text": "Gridiron football\n\nGridiron football, also known as North American football or simply football, is a football sport primarily played in the United States and Canada. American football, which uses 11-player teams, is the form played in the United States and the best known form of gridiron football worldwide, while Canadian football, featuring 12-player teams, predominates in Canada. Other derivative varieties include indoor football, football for smaller teams (most commonly eight players), and informal games such as touch and flag football. Football is played at professional, collegiate, semi-professional, and amateur levels.\n\nThe sport originated in the 19th century out of older games related to modern rugby football and soccer (association football). American and Canadian football developed alongside each other and were originally more distinct before Canadian teams adopted features of the American game. Both varieties are distinguished from other football sports by their use of hard plastic helmets and shoulder pads, the forward pass, the system of downs, a number of unique rules and positions, measurement in customary units of yards (even in Canada, which mostly metricated in the 1970s, yards are still used), and a distinctive brown leather ball in the shape of a prolate spheroid with pointed ends.\n\nThe international governing body for the sport is the International Federation of American Football (IFAF); although the organization plays all of its international competitions under American rules, it uses a definition of the game that is broad enough that it includes Canadian football under its umbrella, and Football Canada (the governing body for Canadian football) is an IFAF member.\n\nThe sport is typically known as simply \"football\" in the countries where it originated, regardless of the specific variety. Various sources use the term \"North American football\" when discussing the American and Canadian games together. It is also sometimes known as \"gridiron football\". This name originates with the sport's characteristic playing field, which is marked by a series of parallel lines along the width of the field in a pattern resembling a cooking gridiron. However, \"gridiron football\", or \"gridiron\", usually refers to American football specifically, sometimes in distinction from Canadian football. \"Gridiron\" is the usual name for American football in Australia and New Zealand. Some sources, including the International Federation of American Football (IFAF), use \"American football\" inclusive of Canadian football and other varieties.\n\nThe sport developed from informal games played in North America during the 19th century. Early games had a variety of local rules and were generally similar to modern rugby union and soccer. By the 1860s, teams from universities were playing each other, leading to more standardized rules and the creation of college football. While several American schools adopted rules based on the soccer rules of the British Football Association, Harvard University held to its traditional \"carrying game\". Meanwhile, McGill University in Montreal used rules based on rugby union. In 1874, Harvard and McGill University in Montreal organized two games using each other's rules. Harvard took a liking to McGill's rugby-style rules, and subsequently played several other U.S. colleges over the next several years.\n\nAmerican football teams and organizations subsequently adopted new rules which distinguished the game from rugby. Among the most consequential changes was the adoption of the forward pass in 1906, which allowed the quarterback to throw the ball forward over the line of scrimmage to a receiver. Canadian football remained akin to rugby for decades, though a progressive faction of players, chiefly based in the western provinces, demanded changes to the game based on the innovations in American football. Over the years, the sport adopted more Americanized rules, though it retained some of its historical features, including a 110-yard field, 12-player teams, and three downs instead of four.\n\n\n\nThis is a minimal description of the game in general, with elements common to all or almost all variants of the game. For more specific rules, see each code's individual articles.\n\nPrior to the start of a game, a coin toss determines which team will kick off the ball to their opponent. Each team lines up on opposite halves of the field, with a minimum ten yards of space between them for the kickoff. The team receiving the ball can make a fair catch (which stops the play immediately), catch the ball and run it back until the ball carrier is tackled, or, if the ball is kicked out of bounds, let the ball go dead on its own (the last case usually happens when the ball is kicked all the way into or through the opponent's end zone, resulting in a touchback and the ball being brought several yards out of the end zone to begin play). A kicking team can, under special circumstances, attempt to recover its own kick, but the rules of the game make it very difficult to do so reliably, and so this tactic is usually only used as a surprise or desperation maneuver.\n\nAt this point, play from scrimmage begins. The team in possession of the ball is on \"offense\" and the opponent is on \"defense\". The offense is given a set amount of time (up to forty seconds, depending on the governing body), during which the teams can set up a play in a huddle and freely substitute players to set into a formation, in which the offense must remain perfectly still for at least one second (the formation requirement does not apply to Canadian football). At least half of the players (seven in standard American and Canadian football, four in standard indoor ball) on the offense must line up on the line of scrimmage in this formation, including the snapper, who handles the ball before play commences; the rest can (and almost always do) line up behind the line. Neither the offense nor the defense can cross the line of scrimmage before the play commences. Once the formation is set, the snapper snaps the ball to one of the players behind him. (A snapper must snap the ball within 20 to 25 seconds of the official setting the ball back into position after the previous play, and a play clock is kept to enforce the measure.) Once the ball is snapped, the play has commenced, and the offense's goal is to continue advancing the ball toward their opponent's end zone. This can be done either by running with the ball or by a rule unique to football known as the \"forward pass\". In a forward pass, a player from behind the line of scrimmage throws the ball to an eligible receiver (another back or one player on each end of the line), who must catch the ball before it touches the ground. The play stops when a player with the ball touches any part of his body other than hand or foot to the ground, runs out of the boundaries of the field, is obstructed from making further forward progress, or a forward pass hits the ground without being caught (in the last case, the ball returns to the spot it was snapped). To stop play, players on defense are allowed to tackle the ball carrier at any time the ball is in play, provided they do not grab the face mask of the helmet or make helmet-to-helmet contact when doing so. At any time, the player with the ball can attempt a backward, or lateral, pass to any other player in order to keep the ball in play; this is generally rare. Any player on defense can, at any time, attempt to intercept a forward pass in flight, at which point the team gains possession; they can also gain possession by recovering a fumble or stripping the ball away from the ball carrier (a \"forced fumble\"). A typical play can last between five and twenty seconds.\n\nIn the event that any illegal action happens during the play, the results of the previous play are erased and a penalty is assessed, forcing the offending team to surrender between five and fifteen yards of field to the opponent. Whether this yardage is measured from the original spot of the ball before the play, the spot of the illegal action, or the end of the play depends on the individual foul. The most common penalties include \"false start\" (when an offensive player jumps to begin the play before the ball is snapped, a five-yard penalty), \"holding\" (the grabbing of a player other than the ball carrier to obstruct their progress; a ten-yard penalty against offensive players and a five-yard penalty against defensive ones), and \"pass interference\" (when either a receiver or the defending player pushes or blocks the other to prevent them from catching the pass). A team on offense cannot score points as the direct result of a penalty; a defensive foul committed in the team's own end zone, if the penalty is assessed from the spot of the foul, places the ball at the one-yard line. In contrast, a defensive team can score points as a direct result of a penalty; if the offense commits a foul under the same scenario, the defensive team receives two points and a free kick. In all other circumstances (except for the open-ended and extremely rare unfair act clause), a penalty cannot exceed more than half the distance to the end zone. In the event that the penalty would be less advantageous than the result of the actual play, the team not committing the penalty can decline it.\n\nIn order to keep play moving, the offense must make a certain amount of progress (10 yards in most leagues) within a certain number of plays (3 in Canada, 4 in the United States), called downs. If the offense does indeed make this progress, a \"first down\" is achieved, and the team gets 3 or 4 more plays to achieve another 10 yards. If not, the offense loses possession to their opponent at the spot where the ball is. More commonly, however, the team on offense will, if they have a minimal chance of gaining a first down and have only one play left to do it (\"fourth down\" in the U.S., \"third down\" in Canada), attempt a \"scrimmage kick\". There are two types of scrimmage kick: a punt is when the ball is kicked downfield as close to the opponent's end zone as possible without entering it; the kicking team loses possession of the ball after the kick and the receiving team can attempt to advance the ball. The other scrimmage kick is a field goal attempt. This must be attempted by place kick or (more rarely) drop kick, and if the kicked ball passes through the goal set at the edge of the opponent's end zone, the team scores three points. (Four-point field goals are available in a few variations of the game under special rules, but the NFL, college and high school football only offer three-point field goals.) In Canada, any kick that goes into the end zone and is not returned, whether it be a punt or a missed field goal, is awarded one single point.\n\nIf the team in possession of the ball, at any time, advances (either by carrying or catching) the ball into the opponent's end zone, it is a touchdown, and the team scores six points and a free play known as a try. In a try, a team attempts to score one or two points (rules vary by each league, but under standard rules, a field goal on a try is worth one point while another touchdown is worth two). At the college and professional levels, the defense can also score on a try, but only on the same scale (thus a botched try the defense returns for a touchdown scores only two points and not six).\n\nIf a team is in its own end zone and commits a foul, is tackled with the ball, or bats, fumbles, kicks or throws the ball backward out of the field of play through the same end zone, the defense scores a safety, worth two points.\n\nAfter a try, safety or field goal, the team that had possession of the ball goes back to the middle of the field and kicks the ball off to their opponent, and play continues as it did in the beginning of the game.\n\nPlay continues until halftime. (Each team switches their side of the field with the other halfway through each half, at the end of a quarter.) After the halftime break, a new kickoff occurs. Whichever team has more points at the end of the game is declared the winner; in the event of a tie, each league has its own rules for overtime to break the tie. Because of the nature of the game, pure sudden-death overtimes have been abolished at all levels of the game as of 2012.\n\nAt all adult levels of the game, a game is 60 timed minutes in length, split into four 15-minute quarters. (High school football uses 12-minute quarters, and the general rule is that the younger the players, the shorter the quarters typically are.) Because of the halftime, quarter breaks, time-outs, the minute warnings (two minutes before the end of a half in the NFL, three minutes in Canadian football), and frequent stoppages of the game clock (the clock stops, for example, after every incomplete pass and any time a ball goes out of bounds), the actual time it takes for a football game to be completed is typically over three hours.\n\n\n"}

It opened in 1966 and was founded by Bengt Erlandson, more commonly known as Big Bengt.\n\nThe park is located near Hillerstorp in Gnosjö Municipality and is close to E4 motorway and Swedish national road 27.\n\nBig Bengt was born in 1922 in Brännehylte, Småland of the Kingdom of Sweden in Scandinavia, northern Europe. His parents owned a forest farm and a wood mill. Big Bengt was involved in starting over 1,000 companies. His interest in the American frontier and Wild West was born from coming from a countryside where many had emigrated to America and from the stories they told. Bengt went to the United States himself in 1956 at age 34 and in 4 months touring covered 4,000 km. He came back to Sweden with a lot of impressions. When the Swedish national phone company had to get rid of 200,000 telephone poles, Bengt took the opportunity and constructed a western American style frontier fort and town with log cabins as it might have been used by the old United States Cavalry and U.S. Army in the Indian Wars on the western frontier in North America during the 19th century. When many people started to get curious about the place, he realized its commercial/tourist and historical purposes and possibilities. Similar to Walt Disney's construction of various Disneylands and Disney Worlds with \"Frontierlands\" portions built into the entertainment parks in several foreign countries decades later.\n\n\"Big\" Bengt Erlandsson died in March 2016.\n\nThe park was opened in 1966, the year before the debut of \"\"The High Chaparral\" \" an extended hour-long western television series in the new color broadcasting that ran on American TV on the NBC (National Broadcasting Company) television network, for four seasons, 1967-1971, starring Leif Erickson, Linda Cristal, Henry Darrow and Cameron Mitchell. It focused on the adventures and drama about the large but struggling cattle ranch \"The High Chaparral\" on the high desert scrublands of southern Arizona Territory near the Mexican border and conflicts with the Apache Indians and their famous chief Cochise and the local United States Cavalry / U.S. Army troops. It's the stories of newly arrived owner \"Big John\" Cannon (former Union Army captain in the recent American Civil War, 1861-1865), his brother Buck, who fought for the opposing southern Confederacy, John's son \"Blue Boy\" and new beautiful dark-haired sophisticated Latino/Mexican wife Victoria, thirty years his junior, daughter from a neighboring Mexican cattle baron across the border that he has forged an alliance against his opposition.\n\nIt was produced by David Dortort, who also created the earlier hit American TV series also on NBC. \"Bonanza\" (1959-1973) about the Cartwright family - a father and three sons by successive wives on a huge ranch named \"The Ponderosa\" near Lake Tahoe on the California-Nevada border at the edge of the Sierra Nevada mountains chain by the rich silver strike of the \"Comstock Lode\" mines of famed Virginia City, Nevada in the 1870s also.\n\nThe theme park stages several stunt shows a day. It also has a steam train that runs through the park. There is both the classic Wild West section, an Indian themed area, a Mexican themed area, and a museum overflowing with cultural artifacts, old cars, machinery, and various Cold War oddities such as the bronze monster-size statue of Lenin expelled from Nowa Huta.\nPonderosa Ranch\n\n"}

It was founded in Seattle in 1991 by Jim Rose and his wife BeBe Aschard Rose.The sideshow came to prominence to an American audience as a second stage show at the 1992 Lollapalooza festival, then called the \"Jim Rose Circus Sideshow\", although they had toured the Northwest and Canada and had several US TV appearances before this time. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine called the show an \"absolute must-see act\" and USA Today termed Rose's troupe \"Lollapalooza's word-of-mouth hit attraction\".\n\nAfter Lollapalooza, in 1993 Jim Rose headlined seven world tours and released a self-titled video on Rick Rubin's American Recordings that quickly became a cult classic.\n\nIn 1994, the Jim Rose Circus was chosen to tour with Nine Inch Nails, Pop Will Eat Itself and a then-unknown Marilyn Manson, and later with KoRn and Godsmack. 1998 saw another world tour featuring female sumo wrestling, Mexican transvestite wrestling and chainsaw football. The show landed Rose and troupe in jail in Lubbock, Texas and for four months the show was banned from New Zealand. \n\nJim Rose was also the top ticket of the Melbourne (Australia), New Zealand and Edinburgh (Scotland) Fringe and Comedy Festivals.\n\nOn September 18 2018 Jim Rose announced that he has has formed the Jim Rose Zombie Circus. Which will be a mix of American Halloween and European comedy horror spectacle with amazing acrobats and other mesmerizing performers along with pyrotechnics and the beat of a big brass band playing and running around the stage all at the same time. No dates or performers have been announced at this time. \n\nRose himself performs in between acts, mostly comedy but often stunts as well such as attaching paper currency to his forehead with a staple gun, driving a long nail into his nostril and having darts thrown into his back. During the show's final act, he would escape from a straitjacket. His most outrageous trick followed: he would invite audience members to stand on his head after he had placed it in a shallow crate of broken glass.\n\n\nJim Rose and The Enigma were featured in the Season 2 episode of \"The X-Files\", \"Humbug\"; the episode was set in a community of sideshow and former sideshow workers.\n\nHomer Simpson runs away and joins the Jim Rose Circus as a cannonball catcher (not to be confused with a human cannonball) on the episode \"Homerpalooza\" of \"The Simpsons\".\n\n\"The Jim Rose Circus Sideshow\" video tape (1993 American Recordings) was re-released in 2003 as a DVD by Moonshine Music.\n\n\"The Jim Rose Twisted Tour\" was a seven-episode series that debuted March 2003 on the opening week of the Travel Channel, although only five episodes were aired. It was released in 2006 on DVD, which includes all episodes.\n\nJim Rose appeared in the movie \"Doubting Riley\", a film by HBO's Project Greenlight alumni. Rose voiced the psychotic character Psymon Stark in the video games \"SSX Tricky\" and \"Sled Storm\".\n\nJim Rose wrote the autobiographical \"Freak Like Me (Real, Raw, and Dangerous)\" with journalist Melissa Rossi in 1995 (). The book describes Rose's early years and features a stream of consciousness on-the-road account of the Jim Rose Circus tour with Lollapalooza. The book's title is a reference to \"Black Like Me\".\n\nRose also released the book \"Angles\" in 1999 and \"Snake Oil (Life's Calculations, Misdirections, And Manipulations)\" in 2005. The cover art was by Gail Potocki. Jim Rose also wrote the introduction to the book \"Gail Potocki: The Union of Hope and Sadness\" in 2006.\n\nRose was written about extensively in Marilyn Manson's autobiography 'Long Hard Road Out Of Hell'. The stories refer to the 1994 'Downward Spiral Tour' with Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails. Road manager Jan Gregor wrote \"Circus of the Scars\" (Brennan Dalsgard Pub 1998 ) about the group's formation and first tours.\n\nAccording to an interview with \"Oddities Magazine\", Jim Rose claims to have been involved in fundraising for the Mo Udall political campaign during a time in his life when he was addicted to heroin. He was quoted as stating that \"[Mo] ran against Jimmy Carter and I was his fundraiser... I used to do fundraisers with like Gregory Peck and Robert Redford, actually while I was on heroin. They didn’t know... actually I forgot to tell them.\"\n\nIn 2012 Jim Rose became one of four contributors to the \"Fraud, Scam, Rip Off and Con Artists BEWARE\" website, a not-for-profit organisation aimed at informing the public about confidence tricks and exposing artist and band phishing techniques used by predators.\n\nIn 2013 Jim Rose started working with underground artists to help them fight against corporate entertainment promoters by using DIY marketing techniques. He released the video \"Bands Beware Of Jim Rose Circus Scam That Actually Works To Make You Better Known\" as part of a charity event taping.\n\nRose has been hired by corporations including Microsoft and regularly speaks as a consultant for PR firms; in this regard he has been pictured on the cover of \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"Fast Company\", and is featured in the marketing book \"The Deviant's Advantage\". His PR company represents poker sites and manages publicity for top poker players.\n\nIn 2008 Rose was hired as spokesperson and performer for Dos Equis in the \"Jim Rose Most Interesting Show In The World\" U.S tour. Rose has also served as a spokesman for Gordon's Gin.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" described the circus as an \"absolute must-see act\". \"The Independent\" praised the show as \"brutally comic\", adding that Rose \"plays the highly-strung audience like a violin\". \"Melody Maker\" compared the \"revolted amusement\" of the audience to that of tourists at a bullfight.\n\nBritish Circus proprietor Gerry Cottle said, \"I've seen a lot of things in my time. I must see 40 circuses a year, but this lot... They came on in their street clothes and then... They're beyond anything I've ever seen. They shocked me.\" \"The Times Magazine\" said that while it may not be everyone's idea of entertainment, it certainly did not deserve to be banned.\n\n"}

Short followed by a sequel House Got Ghost\n\nThe story revolves around three brothers from a middle-income background in contemporary Singapore. These are characters who are representative of the business owners, white and blue collar workers of Singaporeans.\n\nThe oldest brother Yang Bao Hui (by Henry Thia) represents the lower income group. As a child, Hui left school at an early age to earn money to help support his poverty stricken family. He has been working as a delivery man in the same company for the last 30 years. At the persuasion of his youngest brother, he strikes out as an entrepreneur to sell health supplements. As business improves, Bao Hui quits his dead-end job and puts all his time into the business. Unfortunately the business is forced to a standstill when the health supplement is deemed unsafe for public consumption, which inadvertently brings Bao Hui close to financial ruin.\n\nThe second brother Yang Bao Qiang (by Jack Neo) portrays a well-heeled successful businessman. As the owner of his own business, he and his wife flaunts their wealth in typical Singaporean fashion, with designer clothes, a flashy car and a big house to put it all in. However in a moment of greed, Bao Qiang allows himself to be cheated out of his fortune and gets into a very difficult financial situation.\n\nThe youngest brother Yang Bao Huang (by Mark Lee) represents the ordinary middle working class. He earns a good salary working as a multi-level marketing regional supervisor for a health supplement trading company, and spends lavishly to maintain his ‘wannabe’ lifestyle. When the health supplement business goes bust, debts pile up and Bao Huang too, faces financial ruin. Even his wife gets involved, having their relationship soured and taking the blame for Bao Huang for a crime which she gets convicted for.\n\nAs the winds of fortune changes, the brothers begin to neglect their elderly mother. It was easy to be generous and filial during the good times but when household budgets tighten, what is the cost of true filial piety? Even the most basic arrangements, including whom their mother should stay with, becomes a contentious issue.\n\nThe families of each brother also try their luck at helping to earn an income to support. Unfortunately while out on the road with their getai lady boss rushing to another performance, a car accident occurs and Bao Qiang's wife and daughter are involved.\n\nBao Qiang's daughter turns out to be in critical condition unless she gets a blood transplant. The brothers' mother too, is in the same hospital. Coincidentally, the same type of blood was required to save both granddaughter and grandmother. The hospital so happened to have only one bag of the required blood, which a scuffle happens between everyone to decide who gets the treatment first.\n\nKnowing the situation, the brother's mother overhears the commotion and sacrifices herself, to save her granddaughter, a younger generation whom she feels deserved to live more than herself as her time already drew near.\n\nMuch later, Bao Huang's wife is released, and the entire family is more well-off as they strike first place in a lottery draw. They give offerings to their mother, thinking that she helped them financially for all her life, whether deceased or living.\n\nThe film ends as the entire family enjoys their new start of life and the three brothers learn of their lesson.\n\nA mini-sequel was filmed and featured in the omnibus horror movie by Jack Neo, Where Got Ghost?.\n\nIt is the Seventh Lunar Month and three brothers - Bao Qiang, Bao Huang and Bao Hui - all pay respects to their deceased mother. They complain bitterly to their mother that they are doing poorly financially, and that their mother is not assisting them supernaturally. Soon afterwards, however, strange things begin to happen at their homes. The brothers all claim to see or hear their mother on numerous occasions. After hearing that parents dying in the night will bring bad luck to their children, Bao Qiang and Bao Huang overrule Bao Hui and urge him to bring their mother's remains to a temple.\n\nBao Hui attempts to bring their mother's urn and tablet to a temple, but is shocked to find it reappearing in his car later. He immediately calls his brothers to accompany him, but they think he is overreacting.\n\nDuring a car journey from Malaysia, the ghostly apparition of their mother suddenly appears on the road before them, causing Bao Huang to swerve and nearly crash off a cliff. Fortunately, the brothers manage to crawl out unscathed. As they wonder over their mother's sudden appearance, they witness a massive landslide along the road ahead. By causing them to swerve, their mother actually saved their lives.\n\nThe main characters of the movie were played by the following actors:\n"}

{"id": "39582687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39582687", "title": "Mr. Sowerberry", "text": "Mr. Sowerberry\n\nMr. Sowerberry is a fictional character who appears as a weak antagonist in the Charles Dickens novel \"Oliver Twist\". He is an undertaker and coffin maker who owns and operates a small dark shop in a small town some 75 miles from London. This shop also serves as a dwelling for himself, his wife, a maidservant named Charlotte, an assistant named Noah Claypole, and, for a short period, as an apprentice, the protagonist of the novel, Master Oliver Twist.\n\nIn the novel Sowerberry is described as a \"\"tall gaunt, large jointed man, attired in a suit of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour, and shoes to answer\".\" The various stage and screen adaptations of the novel do their best to interpret this description in the guise of an older male. Funerary practices and social customs of the time add depth to this character sometimes presenting him as a weak, miserly, menacing and unwelcomed dark spectre.\n\nAlthough portrayed somewhat humorously in the musical adaptation of the novel, particularly in his feigning subservience to Mrs. Sowerberry, Mr. Sowerberry is nonetheless a miser who, despite what wealth he has acquired over the years, does very little to improve the squalid lives of those around him simply because he believes it is the job of others and is therefore none of his concern. In the scene where he visits the home of a destitute family whose mother has died, there is no overt callousness, it is merely a job and nothing more.\n\nDickens created Sowerberry's name and character from his observation of living examples in the society in which he lived. Dickens had extensive knowledge of London street life; of the 'real' poor and 'false' rich. His novels are full of characters with odd sounding names which in reality assist the reader in visualizing the character itself. For example a 'sour berry' may make the reader grimace or think of something unpalatable, stale or stagnant. In the novel, Dickens creates an image of the undertaker we have come to recognize so well as represented in the modern media: an older tallish, thin man wearing all black, the costume of his trade. But, as a contrast, there are also moments in the novel where he appears benevolent or doting, almost genial.\n\nDickens includes at least two similar characters in other novels for comparison. In Martin Chuzzlewit the undertaker is known as Mr. Mould, a balding elderly man in a black suit with, \"...a face in which a queer attempt at melancholy was at odds with a smirk of satisfaction...\" Mr. Omer in David Copperfield is presented as,\"...a merry little old man in black, with rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees of his breeches, black stockings and a broad brimmed hat...\"\n\nSowerberry is representative of a stereotype typical to the English Georgian period and Victorian era of the 19th century, and to his trade. It is likely he belonged to the lower middle class of business owners. Their sole aim was to keep themselves in reasonable comfort as compared to the poorer classes of the time, to protect what reputations they had and retain a little money in their pockets. When Oliver is presented to him as an apprentice his thoughts are on what profit could be made from taking the boy rather than on what was best for his up-bringing.\n\nTypical to its historical era the mourning period after the death of a loved one was an important social custom that entailed certain protocols as did the funeral itself. Specially designed black clothing, a slow moving funeral cortege, even paid mourners at the graveside, were features offered by most city undertakers. Dickens found much of this a mockery as he later commented on in his journal Household Words describing such practices as \"grotesque\" and \"exaggerated\". The pointless expense was further highlighted by him when he described the role of the mute in his novel Martin Chuzzlewit, \"...Two mutes were at the house door, looking as mournful as could reasonably be expected of men with such a thriving job in hand...\"\n\nEnglish adaptations of the novel have included numerous actors, some well known, in the character of Mr. Sowerberry. The earliest known motion picture version of Frank Lloyd's 1922 production placed the American actor Nelson McDowell in the role. David Lean created some very atmospheric settings in his movie version \"Oliver Twist\" which featured Gibb McLaughlin as Mr. Sowerberry.\n\nWith the advent of television it was inevitable that the classic tale become a miniseries and in 1962 the BBC enlisted the talents of Donald Eccles to play the role of the undertaker.\n\nIn 1960 the novel Oliver Twist was further adapted by Lionel Bart as the musical Oliver! which premiered in the West End. The original cast included the Australian, Barry Humphries in the role. It gave the character a first-name of Henry and was a minor singing role featuring the song, 'That's Your Funeral'. \"Oliver!\" was brought to Broadway in 1963 and later revived in 1984.\n\nFollowing the success of the theatrical musical presentation a motion picture version of that adaptation was produced in 1968 with Leonard Rossiter as Mr. Sowerberry. In this portrayal the undertakers cool, and sometimes cruel traits, are largely underplayed and are replaced by his fondness for intoxicating drink. This is in line with Bart's adaptation of the original novel.\n\nIn the 1982 made-for-TV movie version, Mr. Sowerberry is portrayed by Philip Locke and three years later by Raymond Witch in another BBC series.\n\nIn 1994, \"Oliver!\" was revived at the Palladium Theatre in London and again in 2009.\n\nRoger Lloyd-Pack played Sowerberry in the ITV Network miniseries of the Dickens novel in 1999.\n\n2005, Roman Polanski production enlisted the services of Michael Heath as the undertaker.\n\nIn the 2007 BBC television adaptation he is played by John Sessions.\n\nIn December 2008, \"Oliver!\" was revived at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London with Julian Bleach playing both Sowerberry and Grimwig.\n\nAnd so it goes on, the adaptation by Bart continues to play in both large well known theatres and small auditoriums around the world.\n\n"}

{"id": "25049383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25049383", "title": "Neuroscience of music", "text": "Neuroscience of music\n\nThe neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, neurology, neuroanatomy, psychology, music theory, computer science, and other relevant fields.\n\nThe cognitive neuroscience of music represents a significant branch of music psychology, and is distinguished from related fields such as cognitive musicology in its reliance on direct observations of the brain and use of such techniques as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET).\n\nSuccessive parts of the tonotopically organized basilar membrane in the cochlea resonate to corresponding frequency bandwidths of incoming sound. The hair cells in the cochlea release neurotransmitter as a result, causing action potentials down the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve then leads to several layers of synapses at numerous nuclei in the auditory brainstem. These nuclei are also tonotopically organized, and the process of achieving this tonotopy after the cochlea is not well understood. This tonotopy is in general maintained up to primary auditory cortex in mammals, however it is often found that cells in primary and non-primary auditory cortex have spatio-temporal receptive fields, rather than being strictly responsive or phase-locking their action potentials to narrow frequency regions.\n\nA widely postulated mechanism for pitch processing in the early central auditory system is the phase-locking and mode-locking of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus. Phase-locking to stimulus frequencies has been shown in the auditory nerve, the cochlear nucleus, the inferior colliculus, and the auditory thalamus. By phase- and mode-locking in this way, the auditory brainstem is known to preserve a good deal of the temporal and low-passed frequency information from the original sound; this is evident by measuring the auditory brainstem response using EEG. This temporal preservation is one way to argue directly for the temporal theory of pitch perception, and to argue indirectly against the place theory of pitch perception.\n\nStudies suggest that individuals are capable of automatically detecting a difference or anomaly in a melody such as an out of tune pitch which does not fit with their previous music experience. This automatic processing occurs in the secondary auditory cortex. Brattico, Tervaniemi, Naatanen, and Peretz (2006) performed one such study to determine if the detection of tones that do not fit an individual's expectations can occur automatically. They recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in nonmusicians as they were presented unfamiliar melodies with either an out of tune pitch or an out of key pitch while participants were either distracted from the sounds or attending to the melody. Both conditions revealed an early frontal negativity independent of where attention was directed. This negativity originated in the auditory cortex, more precisely in the supratemporal lobe (which corresponds with the secondary auditory cortex) with greater activity from the right hemisphere. The negativity response was larger for pitch that was out of tune than that which was out of key. Ratings of musical incongruity were higher for out of tune pitch melodies than for out of key pitch. In the focused attention condition, out of key and out of tune pitches produced late parietal positivity. The findings of Brattico et al. (2006) suggest that there is automatic and rapid processing of melodic properties in the secondary auditory cortex. The findings that pitch incongruities were detected automatically, even in processing unfamiliar melodies, suggests that there is an automatic comparison of incoming information with long term knowledge of musical scale properties, such as culturally influenced rules of musical properties (common chord progressions, scale patterns, etc.) and individual expectations of how the melody should proceed. The auditory area processes the sound of the music. The auditory area is located in the temporal lobe. The temporal lobe deals with the recognition and perception of auditory stimuli, memory, and speech (Kinser, 2012).\n\nThe right secondary auditory cortex has finer pitch resolution than the left. Hyde, Peretz and Zatorre (2008) used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in their study to test the involvement of right and left auditory cortical regions in frequency processing of melodic sequences. As well as finding superior pitch resolution in the right secondary auditory cortex, specific areas found to be involved were the planum temporale (PT) in the secondary auditory cortex, and the primary auditory cortex in the medial section of Heschl's gyrus (HG).\n\nMany neuroimaging studies have found evidence of the importance of right secondary auditory regions in aspects of musical pitch processing, such as melody. Many of these studies such as one by Patterson, Uppenkamp, Johnsrude and Griffiths (2002) also find evidence of a hierarchy of pitch processing. Patterson et al. (2002) used spectrally matched sounds which produced: no pitch, fixed pitch or melody in an fMRI study and found that all conditions activated HG and PT. Sounds with pitch activated more of these regions than sounds without. When a melody was produced activation spread to the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and planum polare (PP). These results support the existence of a pitch processing hierarchy.\n\nThe belt and parabelt areas of the right hemisphere are involved in processing rhythm. When individuals are preparing to tap out a rhythm of regular intervals (1:2 or 1:3) the left frontal cortex, left parietal cortex, and right cerebellum are all activated. With more difficult rhythms such as a 1:2.5, more areas in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum are involved. EEG recordings have also shown a relationship between brain electrical activity and rhythm perception. Snyder and Large (2005) performed a study examining rhythm perception in human subjects, finding that activity in the gamma band (20 – 60 Hz) corresponds to the beats in a simple rhythm. Two types of gamma activity were found by Snyder & Large: induced gamma activity, and evoked gamma activity. Evoked gamma activity was found after the onset of each tone in the rhythm; this activity was found to be phase-locked (peaks and troughs were directly related to the exact onset of the tone) and did not appear when a gap (missed beat) was present in the rhythm. Induced gamma activity, which was not found to be phase-locked, was also found to correspond with each beat. However, induced gamma activity did not subside when a gap was present in the rhythm, indicating that induced gamma activity may possibly serve as a sort of internal metronome independent of auditory input. The motor and auditory areas are located in the cerebrum of the brain. The motor area processes the rhythm of the music (Dean, 2013). The motor area of the brain is located in the parietal lobe. The parietal lobe also deals with orientation, recognition, and perception.\n\nTonality describes the relationships between the elements of melody and harmony – tones, intervals, chords, and scales. These relationships are often characterised as hierarchical, such that one of the elements dominates or attracts another. They occur both within and between every type of element, creating a rich and time-varying percept between tones and their melodic, harmonic, and chromatic contexts. In one conventional sense, tonality refers to just the major and minor scale types – examples of scales whose elements are capable of maintaining a consistent set of functional relationships. The most important functional relationship is that of the tonic note and the tonic chord with the rest of the scale. The tonic is the element which tends to assert its dominance and attraction over all others, and it functions as the ultimate point of attraction, rest and resolution for the scale.\n\nThe right auditory cortex is primarily involved in perceiving pitch, and parts of harmony, melody and rhythm. One study by Petr Janata found that there are tonality-sensitive areas in the medial prefrontal cortex, the cerebellum, the superior temporal sulci of both hemispheres and the superior temporal gyri (which has a skew towards the right hemisphere).\n\nMusical performance usually involves at least three elementary motor control functions: timing, sequencing, and spatial organization of motor movements. Accuracy in timing of movements is related to musical rhythm. Rhythm, the pattern of temporal intervals within a musical measure or phrase, in turn creates the perception of stronger and weaker beats. Sequencing and spatial organization relate to the expression of individual notes on a musical instrument.\n\nThese functions and their neural mechanisms have been investigated separately in many studies, but little is known about their combined interaction in producing a complex musical performance. The study of music requires examining them together.\n\nAlthough neural mechanisms involved in timing movement have been studied rigorously over the past 20 years, much remains controversial. The ability to phrase movements in precise time has been accredited to a neural metronome or clock mechanism where time is represented through oscillations or pulses. An opposing view to this metronome mechanism has also been hypothesized stating that it is an emergent property of the kinematics of movement itself. Kinematics is defined as parameters of movement through space without reference to forces (for example, direction, velocity and acceleration).\n\nFunctional neuroimaging studies, as well as studies of brain-damaged patients, have linked movement timing to several cortical and sub-cortical regions, including the cerebellum, basal ganglia and supplementary motor area (SMA). Specifically the basal ganglia and possibly the SMA have been implicated in interval timing at longer timescales (1 second and above), while the cerebellum may be more important for controlling motor timing at shorter timescales (milliseconds). Furthermore, these results indicate that motor timing is not controlled by a single brain region, but by a network of regions that control specific parameters of movement and that depend on the relevant timescale of the rhythmic sequence.\n\nMotor sequencing has been explored in terms of either the ordering of individual movements, such as finger sequences for key presses, or the coordination of subcomponents of complex multi-joint movements. Implicated in this process are various cortical and sub-cortical regions, including the basal ganglia, the SMA and the pre-SMA, the cerebellum, and the premotor and prefrontal cortices, all involved in the production and learning of motor sequences but without explicit evidence of their specific contributions or interactions amongst one another. In animals, neurophysiological studies have demonstrated an interaction between the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia during the learning of movement sequences. Human neuroimaging studies have also emphasized the contribution of the basal ganglia for well-learned sequences.\n\nThe cerebellum is arguably important for sequence learning and for the integration of individual movements into unified sequences, while the pre-SMA and SMA have been shown to be involved in organizing or chunking of more complex movement sequences.\nChunking, defined as the re-organization or re-grouping of movement sequences into smaller sub-sequences during performance, is thought to facilitate the smooth performance of complex movements and to improve motor memory. \nLastly, the premotor cortex has been shown to be involved in tasks that require the production of relatively complex sequences, and it may contribute to motor prediction.\n\nFew studies of complex motor control have distinguished between sequential and spatial organization, yet expert musical performances demand not only precise sequencing but also spatial organization of movements. Studies in animals and humans have established the involvement of parietal, sensory–motor and premotor cortices in the control of movements, when the integration of spatial, sensory and motor information is required. Few studies so far have explicitly examined the role of spatial processing in the context of musical tasks.\n\nAn auditory–motor interaction may be loosely defined as any engagement of or communication between the two systems. Two classes of auditory-motor interaction are \"feedforward\" and \"feedback\". In feedforward interactions, it is the auditory system that predominately influences the motor output, often in a predictive way. An example is the phenomenon of tapping to the beat, where the listener anticipates the rhythmic accents in a piece of music. Another example is the effect of music on movement disorders: rhythmic auditory stimuli have been shown to improve walking ability in Parkinson's disease and stroke patients.\n\nFeedback interactions are particularly relevant in playing an instrument such as a violin, or in singing, where pitch is variable and must be continuously controlled. If auditory feedback is blocked, musicians can still execute well-rehearsed pieces, but expressive aspects of performance are affected. When auditory feedback is experimentally manipulated by delays or distortions, motor performance is significantly altered: asynchronous feedback disrupts the timing of events, whereas alteration of pitch information disrupts the selection of appropriate actions, but not their timing. This suggests that disruptions occur because both actions and percepts depend on a single underlying mental representation.\n\nSeveral models of auditory–motor interactions have been advanced. The model of Hickok and Poeppel, which is specific for speech processing, proposes that a ventral auditory stream maps sounds onto meaning, whereas a dorsal stream maps sounds onto articulatory representations. They and others suggest that posterior auditory regions at the parieto-temporal boundary are crucial parts of the auditory–motor interface, mapping auditory representations onto motor representations of speech, and onto melodies.\n\nThe mirror neuron system has an important role in neural models of sensory–motor integration. There is considerable evidence that neurons respond to both actions and the accumulated observation of actions. A system proposed to explain this understanding of actions is that visual representations of actions are mapped onto our own motor system.\n\nSome mirror neurons are activated both by the observation of goal-directed actions, and by the associated sounds produced during the action. This suggests that the auditory modality can access the motor system. While these auditory–motor interactions have mainly been studied for speech processes, and have focused on Broca's area and the vPMC, as of 2011, experiments have begun to shed light on how these interactions are needed for musical performance. Results point to a broader involvement of the dPMC and other motor areas.\n\nCertain aspects of language and melody have been shown to be processed in near identical functional brain areas. Brown, Martinez and Parsons (2006) examined the neurological structural similarities between music and language. Utilizing positron emission tomography (PET), the findings showed that both linguistic and melodic phrases produced activation in almost identical functional brain areas. These areas included the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, Broca's area, anterior insula, primary and secondary auditory cortices, temporal pole, basal ganglia, ventral thalamus and posterior cerebellum. Differences were found in lateralization tendencies as language tasks favoured the left hemisphere, but the majority of activations were bilateral which produced significant overlap across modalities.\n\nSyntactical information mechanisms in both music and language have been shown to be processed similarly in the brain. Jentschke, Koelsch, Sallat and Friederici (2008) conducted a study investigating the processing of music in children with specific language impairments (SLI). Children with typical language development (TLD) showed ERP patterns different from those of children with SLI, which reflected their challenges in processing music-syntactic regularities. Strong correlations between the ERAN (\"Early Right Anterior Negativity\"—a specific ERP measure) amplitude and linguistic and musical abilities provide additional evidence for the relationship of syntactical processing in music and language.\n\nHowever, production of melody and production of speech may be subserved by different neural networks. Stewart, Walsh, Frith and Rothwell (2001) studied the differences between speech production and song production using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Stewart et al. found that TMS applied to the left frontal lobe disturbs speech but not melody supporting the idea that they are subserved by different areas of the brain. The authors suggest that a reason for the difference is that speech generation can be localized well but the underlying mechanisms of melodic production cannot. Alternatively, it was also suggested that speech production may be less robust than melodic production and thus more susceptible to interference.\n\nLanguage processing is a function more of the left side of the brain than the right side, particularly Broca's area and Wernicke's area, though the roles played by the two sides of the brain in processing different aspects of language are still unclear. Music is also processed by both the left and the right sides of the brain. Recent evidence further suggest shared processing between language and music at the conceptual level. It has also been found that, among music conservatory students, the prevalence of absolute pitch is much higher for speakers of tone language, even controlling for ethnic background, showing that language influences how musical tones are perceived.\n\nBrain structure within musicians and non-musicians is distinctly different. Gaser and Schlaug (2003) compared brain structures of professional musicians with non-musicians and discovered gray matter volume differences in motor, auditory and visual-spatial brain regions. Specifically, positive correlations were discovered between musician status (professional, amateur and non-musician) and gray matter volume in the primary motor and somatosensory areas, premotor areas, anterior superior parietal areas and in the inferior temporal gyrus bilaterally. This strong association between musician status and gray matter differences supports the notion that musicians' brains show use-dependent structural changes. Due to the distinct differences in several brain regions, it is unlikely that these differences are innate but rather due to the long-term acquisition and repetitive rehearsal of musical skills.\n\nBrains of musicians also show functional differences from those of non-musicians. Krings, Topper, Foltys, Erberich, Sparing, Willmes and Thron (2000) utilized fMRI to study brain area involvement of professional pianists and a control group while performing complex finger movements. Krings et al. found that the professional piano players showed lower levels of cortical activation in motor areas of the brain. It was concluded that a lesser amount of neurons needed to be activated for the piano players due to long-term motor practice which results in the different cortical activation patterns. Koeneke, Lutz, Wustenberg and Jancke (2004) reported similar findings in keyboard players. Skilled keyboard players and a control group performed complex tasks involving unimanual and bimanual finger movements. During task conditions, strong hemodynamic responses in the cerebellum were shown by both non-musicians and keyboard players, but non-musicians showed the stronger response. This finding indicates that different cortical activation patterns emerge from long-term motor practice. This evidence supports previous data showing that musicians require fewer neurons to perform the same movements.\n\nMusicians have been shown to have significantly more developed left planum temporales, and have also shown to have a greater word memory. Chan's study controlled for age, grade point average and years of education and found that when given a 16 word memory test, the musicians averaged one to two more words above their non musical counterparts.\n\nStudies have shown that the human brain has an implicit musical ability. Koelsch, Gunter, Friederici and Schoger (2000) investigated the influence of preceding musical context, task relevance of unexpected chords and the degree of probability of violation on music processing in both musicians and non-musicians. Findings showed that the human brain unintentionally extrapolates expectations about impending auditory input. Even in non-musicians, the extrapolated expectations are consistent with music theory. The ability to process information musically supports the idea of an implicit musical ability in the human brain. In a follow-up study, Koelsch, Schroger, and Gunter (2002) investigated whether ERAN and N5 could be evoked preattentively in non-musicians. Findings showed that both ERAN and N5 can be elicited even in a situation where the musical stimulus is ignored by the listener indicating that there is a highly differentiated preattentive musicality in the human brain.\n\nMinor neurological differences regarding hemispheric processing exist between brains of males and females. Koelsch, Maess, Grossmann and Friederici (2003) investigated music processing through EEG and ERPs and discovered gender differences. Findings showed that females process music information bilaterally and males process music with a right-hemispheric predominance. However, the early negativity of males was also present over the left hemisphere. This indicates that males do not exclusively utilize the right hemisphere for musical information processing. In a follow-up study, Koelsch, Grossman, Gunter, Hahne, Schroger and Friederici (2003) found that boys show lateralization of the early anterior negativity in the left hemisphere but found a bilateral effect in girls. This indicates a developmental effect as early negativity is lateralized in the right hemisphere in men and in the left hemisphere in boys.\n\nIt has been found that subjects who are lefthanded, particularly those who are also ambidextrous, perform better than righthanders on short term memory for the pitch.\nIt was hypothesized that this handedness advantage is due to the fact that lefthanders have more duplication of storage in the two hemispheres than do righthanders. Other work has shown that there are pronounced differences between righthanders and lefthanders (on a statistical basis) in how musical patterns are perceived, when sounds come from different regions of space. This has been found, for example, in the Octave illusion and the Scale illusion.\n\nMusical imagery refers to the experience of replaying music by imagining it inside the head. Musicians show a superior ability for musical imagery due to intense musical training. Herholz, Lappe, Knief and Pantev (2008) investigated the differences in neural processing of a musical imagery task in musicians and non-musicians. Utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG), Herholz et al. examined differences in the processing of a musical imagery task with familiar melodies in musicians and non-musicians. Specifically, the study examined whether the mismatch negativity (MMN) can be based solely on imagery of sounds. The task involved participants listening to the beginning of a melody, continuation of the melody in his/her head and finally hearing a correct/incorrect tone as further continuation of the melody. The imagery of these melodies was strong enough to obtain an early preattentive brain response to unanticipated violations of the imagined melodies in the musicians. These results indicate similar neural correlates are relied upon for trained musicians imagery and perception. Additionally, the findings suggest that modification of the imagery mismatch negativity (iMMN) through intense musical training results in achievement of a superior ability for imagery and preattentive processing of music.\n\nPerceptual musical processes and musical imagery may share a neural substrate in the brain. A PET study conducted by Zatorre, Halpern, Perry, Meyer and Evans (1996) investigated cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes related to auditory imagery and perceptual tasks. These tasks examined the involvement of particular anatomical regions as well as functional commonalities between perceptual processes and imagery. Similar patterns of CBF changes provided evidence supporting the notion that imagery processes share a substantial neural substrate with related perceptual processes. Bilateral neural activity in the secondary auditory cortex was associated with both perceiving and imagining songs. This implies that within the secondary auditory cortex, processes underlie the phenomenological impression of imagined sounds. The supplementary motor area (SMA) was active in both imagery and perceptual tasks suggesting covert vocalization as an element of musical imagery. CBF increases in the inferior frontal polar cortex and right thalamus suggest that these regions may be related to retrieval and/or generation of auditory information from memory.\n\nAbsolute pitch (AP) is defined as the ability to identify the pitch of a musical tone or to produce a musical tone at a given pitch without the use of an external reference pitch. Neuroscientific research has not discovered a distinct activation pattern common for possessors of AP. Zatorre, Perry, Beckett, Westbury and Evans (1998) examined the neural foundations of AP using functional and structural brain imaging techniques. Positron emission tomography (PET) was utilized to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in musicians possessing AP and musicians lacking AP. When presented with musical tones, similar patterns of increased CBF in auditory cortical areas emerged in both groups. AP possessors and non-AP subjects demonstrated similar patterns of left dorsolateral frontal activity when they performed relative pitch judgments. However, in non-AP subjects activation in the right inferior frontal cortex was present whereas AP possessors showed no such activity. This finding suggests that musicians with AP do not need access to working memory devices for such tasks. These findings imply that there is no specific regional activation pattern unique to AP. Rather, the availability of specific processing mechanisms and task demands determine the recruited neural areas.\n\nEmotions induced by music activate similar frontal brain regions compared to emotions elicited by other stimuli. Schmidt and Trainor (2001) discovered that valence (i.e. positive vs. negative) of musical segments was distinguished by patterns of frontal EEG activity. Joyful and happy musical segments were associated with increases in left frontal EEG activity whereas fearful and sad musical segments were associated with increases in right frontal EEG activity. Additionally, the intensity of emotions was differentiated by the pattern of overall frontal EEG activity. Overall frontal region activity increased as affective musical stimuli became more intense.\n\nMusic is able to create an incredibly pleasurable experience that can be described as \"chills\". Blood and Zatorre (2001) used PET to measure changes in cerebral blood flow while participants listened to music that they knew to give them the \"chills\" or any sort of intensely pleasant emotional response. They found that as these chills increase, many changes in cerebral blood flow are seen in brain regions such as the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum, midbrain, and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex. Many of these areas appear to be linked to reward, motivation, emotion, and arousal, and are also activated in other pleasurable situations. Nucleus accumbens (a part of striatum) is involved in both music related emotions, as well as rhythmic timing.\n\nWhen unpleasant melodies are played, the posterior cingulate cortex activates, which indicates a sense of conflict or emotional pain. The right hemisphere has also been found to be correlated with emotion, which can also activate areas in the cingulate in times of emotional pain, specifically social rejection (Eisenberger). This evidence, along with observations, has led many musical theorists, philosophers and neuroscientists to link emotion with tonality. This seems almost obvious because the tones in music \"seem\" like a characterization of the tones in human speech, which indicate emotional content. The vowels in the phonemes of a song are elongated for a dramatic effect, and it seems as though musical tones are simply exaggerations of the normal verbal tonality.\n\nMusical memory involves both explicit and implicit memory systems. Explicit musical memory is further differentiated between episodic (where, when and what of the musical experience) and semantic (memory for music knowledge including facts and emotional concepts). Implicit memory centers on the 'how' of music and involves automatic processes such as procedural memory and motor skill learning – in other words skills critical for playing an instrument. Samson and Baird (2009) found that the ability of musicians with Alzheimer's Disease to play an instrument (implicit procedural memory) may be preserved.\n\nA PET study looking into the neural correlates of musical semantic and episodic memory found distinct activation patterns. Semantic musical memory involves the sense of familiarity of songs. The semantic memory for music condition resulted in bilateral activation in the medial and orbital frontal cortex, as well as activation in the left angular gyrus and the left anterior region of the middle temporal gyri. These patterns support the functional asymmetry favouring the left hemisphere for semantic memory. Left anterior temporal and inferior frontal regions that were activated in the musical semantic memory task produced activation peaks specifically during the presentation of musical material, suggestion that these regions are somewhat functionally specialized for musical semantic representations.\n\nEpisodic memory of musical information involves the ability to recall the former context associated with a musical excerpt. In the condition invoking episodic memory for music, activations were found bilaterally in the middle and superior frontal gyri and precuneus, with activation predominant in the right hemisphere. Other studies have found the precuneus to become activated in successful episodic recall. As it was activated in the familiar memory condition of episodic memory, this activation may be explained by the successful recall of the melody.\n\nWhen it comes to memory for pitch, there appears to be a dynamic and distributed brain network subserves pitch memory processes. Gaab, Gaser, Zaehle, Jancke and Schlaug (2003) examined the functional anatomy of pitch memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An analysis of performance scores in a pitch memory task resulted in a significant correlation between good task performance and the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) as well as the dorsolateral cerebellum. Findings indicate that the dorsolateral cerebellum may act as a pitch discrimination processor and the SMG may act as a short-term pitch information storage site. The left hemisphere was found to be more prominent in the pitch memory task than the right hemispheric regions.\n\nMusical training has been shown to aid memory. Altenmuller et al. studied the difference between active and passive musical instruction and found both that over a longer (but not short) period of time, the actively taught students retained much more information than the passively taught students. The actively taught students were also found to have greater cerebral cortex activation. It should also be noted that the passively taught students weren't wasting their time; they, along with the active group, displayed greater left hemisphere activity, which is typical in trained musicians.\n\nTreder et al. identified neural correlates of attention when listening to simplified polyphonic music patterns. In a musical oddball experiment, they had participants shift selective attention to one out of three different instruments in music audio clips, with each instrument occasionally playing one or several notes deviating from an otherwise repetitive pattern. Contrasting attended versus unattended instruments, ERP analysis shows subject- and instrument-specific responses including P300 and early auditory components. The attended instrument could be classified offline with high accuracy. This indicates that attention paid to a particular instrument in polyphonic music can be inferred from ongoing EEG, a finding that is potentially relevant for building more ergonomic music-listing based brain-computer interfaces.\n\nMusical four-year-olds have been found to have one greater left hemisphere intrahemispheric coherence. Musicians have been found to have more developed anterior portions of the corpus callosum in a study by Cowell et al. in 1992. This was confirmed by a study by Schlaug et al. in 1995 that found that classical musicians between the ages of 21 and 36 have significantly greater anterior corpora callosa than the non-musical control. Schlaug also found that there was a strong correlation of musical exposure before the age of seven, and a great increase in the size of the corpus callosum. These fibers join together the left and right hemispheres and indicate an increased relaying between both sides of the brain. This suggests the merging between the spatial- emotiono-tonal processing of the right brain and the linguistical processing of the left brain. This large relaying across many different areas of the brain might contribute to music's ability to aid in memory function.\n\nFocal hand dystonia is a task-related movement disorder associated with occupational activities that require repetitive hand movements. Focal hand dystonia is associated with abnormal processing in the premotor and primary sensorimotor cortices. An fMRI study examined five guitarists with focal hand dystonia. The study reproduced task-specific hand dystonia by having guitarists use a real guitar neck inside the scanner as well as performing a guitar exercise to trigger abnormal hand movement. The dystonic guitarists showed significantly more activation of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex as well as a bilateral underactivation of premotor areas. This activation pattern represents abnormal recruitment of the cortical areas involved in motor control. Even in professional musicians, widespread bilateral cortical region involvement is necessary to produce complex hand movements such as scales and arpeggios. The abnormal shift from premotor to primary sensorimotor activation directly correlates with guitar-induced hand dystonia.\n\nMusic agnosia, an auditory agnosia, is a syndrome of selective impairment in music recognition. Three cases of music agnosia are examined by Dalla Bella and Peretz (1999); C.N., G.L., and I.R.. All three of these patients suffered bilateral damage to the auditory cortex which resulted in musical difficulties while speech understanding remained intact. Their impairment is specific to the recognition of once familiar melodies. They are spared in recognizing environmental sounds and in recognizing lyrics. Peretz (1996) has studied C.N.'s music agnosia further and reports an initial impairment of pitch processing and spared temporal processing. C.N. later recovered in pitch processing abilities but remained impaired in tune recognition and familiarity judgments.\n\nMusical agnosias may be categorized based on the process which is impaired in the individual. Apperceptive music agnosia involves an impairment at the level of perceptual analysis involving an inability to encode musical information correctly. Associative music agnosia reflects an impaired representational system which disrupts music recognition. Many of the cases of music agnosia have resulted from surgery involving the middle cerebral artery. Patient studies have surmounted a large amount of evidence demonstrating that the left side of the brain is more suitable for holding long-term memory representations of music and that the right side is important for controlling access to these representations. Associative music agnosias tend to be produced by damage to the left hemisphere, while apperceptive music agnosia reflects damage to the right hemisphere.\n\nCongenital amusia, otherwise known as tone deafness, is a term for lifelong musical problems which are not attributable to mental retardation, lack of exposure to music or deafness, or brain damage after birth. Amusic brains have been found in fMRI studies to have less white matter and thicker cortex than controls in the right inferior frontal cortex. These differences suggest abnormal neuronal development in the auditory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, two areas which are important in musical-pitch processing.\n\nStudies on those with amusia suggest different processes are involved in speech tonality and musical tonality. Congenital amusics lack the ability to distinguish between pitches and so are for example unmoved by dissonance and playing the wrong key on a piano. They also cannot be taught to remember a melody or to recite a song; however, they are still capable of hearing the intonation of speech, for example, distinguishing between \"You speak French\" and \"You speak French?\" when spoken.\n\nDamage to the amygdala has selective emotional impairments on musical recognition. Gosselin, Peretz, Johnsen and Adolphs (2007) studied S.M., a patient with bilateral damage of the amygdala with the rest of the temporal lobe undamaged and found that S.M. was impaired in recognition of scary and sad music. S.M.'s perception of happy music was normal, as was her ability to use cues such as tempo to distinguish between happy and sad music. It appears that damage specific to the amygdala can selectively impair recognition of scary music.\n\nSpecific musical impairments may result from brain damage leaving other musical abilities intact. Cappelletti, Waley-Cohen, Butterworth and Kopelman (2000) studied a single case study of patient P.K.C., a professional musician who sustained damage to the left posterior temporal lobe as well as a small right occipitotemporal lesion. After sustaining damage to these regions, P.K.C. was selectively impaired in the areas of reading, writing and understanding musical notation but maintained other musical skills. The ability to read aloud letters, words, numbers and symbols (including musical ones) was retained. However, P.K.C. was unable to read aloud musical notes on the staff regardless of whether the task involved naming with the conventional letter or by singing or playing. Yet despite this specific deficit, P.K.C. retained the ability to remember and play familiar and new melodies.\n\nArrhythmia in the auditory modality is defined as a disturbance of rhythmic sense; and includes deficits such as the inability to rhythmically perform music, the inability to keep time to music and the inability to discriminate between or reproduce rhythmic patterns. A study investigating the elements of rhythmic function examined Patient H.J., who acquired arrhythmia after sustaining a right temporoparietal infarct.

Produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures, which acquired the live-action DreamWorks studio the same year, the film was directed by Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick from a screenplay by Len Blum, Lorne Cameron, David Hoselton and Kirkpatrick. Featuring the voices of Bruce Willis, Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, William Shatner, Wanda Sykes and Nick Nolte, the film was released on May 19, 2006 in the United States and earned $336 million on an $80 million budget.\n\nWhile scavenging for food, RJ the raccoon enters the cave of Vincent the bear, who has a wagon full of human food taken from a nearby rest stop. RJ accidentally wakes Vincent from his hibernation, and in a race to escape, causes the stash to roll out onto the nearby highway and get run over by a large truck. To avoid being eaten himself, RJ promises Vincent that he will completely replace the stash within the week.\n\nRJ heads towards a recently built suburban housing development in Chesterton, Indiana, separated from a forest glade by a large hedge. There he discovers a pack of animals recently awoken from their hibernation, led by Verne the turtle; the others include squirrel Hammy, skunk Stella, porcupines Penny and Lou, along with their triplet sons, Spike, Bucky and Quillo; and opossum Ozzie and his daughter Heather. The animals are scared, as the development had been built during their hibernation and they fear they will be unable to forage for food in the small glade. RJ shows them the amount of food humans consume and waste and suggests they forage from the humans. Verne is hesitant but the other animals acquiesce. They make bold attempts to steal food directly from the humans, with RJ secretly guiding them to help collect the food he needs to replace Vincent's stash.\n\nWhen the animals raid the trash cans of the homeowners-association chairwoman Gladys Sharp, she calls an animal exterminator named Dwayne LaFontant, who offers to install in her backyard an illegal, lethal trap called the \"Depelter Turbo\". Verne sees this and tries to warn the others, but RJ insists they will be okay. Fearing for the safety of the pack, Verne attempts to return what they stole; he and RJ argue, causing a small rampage through the development and destroying the stash RJ had collected for Vincent. After a brief argument, RJ and Verne make up and RJ rallies the others to raid Gladys' home directly on the night before a large party. With Stella disguised as a cat to distract Gladys' own cat, Tiger, the others enter Gladys' home and collect all the food. RJ inadvertently reveals his duplicity to the animals, just as they are discovered by Gladys who calls Dwayne. RJ escapes with the food for Vincent but leaves the other animals to be captured by Dwayne.\n\nAs RJ returns the food to Vincent, he sees Dwayne's truck drive by and, consumed by remorse, uses the food to knock the truck off the road, enraging Vincent. Dwayne is knocked out while the animals get free, and Spike, Bucky and Quillo use skills they learned from a videogame to drive the truck back to the development. RJ pleads to be let in the truck as Vincent tries to catch him, but the others, angry at his treachery, refuse. Verne convinces the group to forgive RJ since he came back to save them. They return the truck to the development, crashing through Gladys' home, and the animals flee into the hedge. Gladys and Dwayne converge on the animals from one side with a String trimmer and a Cattle prod respectively, while Vincent tries to swipe at them from the other. To escape, RJ gives Hammy a caffeinated beverage, allowing the hyperactive squirrel to move incredibly fast. Hammy is able to manipulate Dwayne into capturing Vincent, causing Vincent, Gladys, and Dwayne to be trapped by the Depelter Turbo while the animals escape. The police and animal control arrive, and Vincent is sent to the Rocky Mountains while Gladys is arrested for using the Depelter Turbo. Dwayne escapes when Gladys gets arrested only to get bitten by Nugent.\n\nRJ and Verne apologize to each other, and RJ is brought into the group, as is Tiger, who became infatuated with Stella even after learning she was a skunk. Verne realizes they have not had a chance to forage for food until Hammy reveals that while sped up, he had been able to collect enough nuts for them all to last the year.\n\n\n\nTwo minor human characters, appearing during the dog chase scene, were voiced by Lee Bienstock and Sean Yazbeck, two participants on \"The Apprentice 5\" as part of a reward for winning a task.\n\nIn July 2002, Jim Carrey announced he would co-star with Shandling in \"Over the Hedge\". In October 2004, however, he left the project and was replaced with Willis.\n\nOn opening weekend, the film was in second place to \"The Da Vinci Code\", but its gross of $38,457,003 did not quite live up to DreamWorks Animation's other titles released over the past few years. The film had a per-theater average of $9,474 from 4,059 theaters. In its second weekend, the film dropped 30% to $27,063,774 for a $6,612 average from an expanded 4,093 theaters and finishing third, behind \"\" and \"The Da Vinci Code\".

The site's consensus states: \"Even if it's not an animation classic, \"Over the Hedge\" is clever and fun, and the jokes cater to family members of all ages.\" On another aggregator, Metacritic, the film has a rating of 67/100, indicating \"generally favorable.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nCritic Frank Lovece of \"Film Journal International\" found that, \"DreamWorks' slapstick animated adaptation of the philosophically satiric comic strip ... is a lot of laughs and boasts a much tighter story than most animated features.\" Ken Fox of \"TVGuide.com\" called it \"a sly satire of American 'enough is never enough' consumerism and blind progress at the expense of the environment. It's also very funny, and the little woodland critters that make up the cast are a kiddie-pleasing bunch\".\n\nThe film was screened as a \"work-in-progress\" on April 29, 2006, at the Indianapolis International Film Festival, and it premiered on April 30, 2006, in Los Angeles. Nick Nolte, Bruce Willis, Avril Lavigne, Garry Shandling, Wanda Sykes, Catherine O'Hara and Steve Carell attended the premiere.

Prostitution has increased within the country since the collapse of the Soviet Union. UNAIDS estimate there are 14,100 female sex workers in Tajikistan. Government official figures for 2015 were 1,777 prostitutes and 194 brothels. Prostitution occurs on the streets and in bars, restaurants, nightclubs and saunas, and HIV prevalence is 3.5% amongst sex workers.\n\nPreviously, as soliciting is an administrative offence, arrested prostitutes are given a nominal fine and released, while those procuring are prosecuted, potentially being punished by up to eight years in jail. In 2015 a new law was passed that doubled the fine for solicitation and added 15 days of home arrest to the punishment.\n\nBeing the poorest country to emerge from the Soviet Union, economic hardship is a primary reason women in the country enter prostitution.\n\nSex trafficking is a problem in the country.\n\nIn June 2014, the Interior Minister, Ramazon Rahimov, expressed concerns about the growth of “immoral crimes,” and ordered a crackdown on prostitution. Brothels were to be raided and sex workers arrested and forcibly tested for HIV and other STIs. 505 sex workers were detained in the capital, Dushanbe, the first few days, of these 450 had an STI according to a statement issued by the minister. 30 of the women were fined.\n\nSex workers reported that this led to rape, sexual humiliation and police officers demanding sex to release the sex workers from detention.\n\nTajikistan is a sex tourism destination for Afghans. The more liberal regime in Tajikistan, the poverty of the country and a similar language make it attractive to Afghans, even if a Tajik visa may cost $500. Tajikistan has such a bad reputation in Afghanistan than men going to the country may tell their wives they are going to India.\n\nTajikistan is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and children from Tajikistan are subjected to sex trafficking primarily in Turkey, UAE, and Russia, and also in Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan, as well as within Tajikistan.\n\nWomen and minors are increasingly vulnerable to trafficking. In some cases, migrant laborers abandon their families, making women more vulnerable to trafficking as sole providers for their families. Some women who travelled to Syria or Iraq with promises of marriage were instead sold into sexual slavery. Tajik women and girls are transported to Afghanistan for the purpose of forced marriage, which can lead to sex trafficking. Tajik children are subjected to sex trafficking in Tajikistan and Afghanistan.\n\nArticle 130.1 of the 2003 criminal code, amended in 2004 and 2008, prohibits all forms of trafficking, including the use of force, fraud or coercion for the purpose of sexual exploitation and forced labour. The article prescribes penalties of five to 15 years imprisonment.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Tajikistan as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.\n\n"}

{"id": "48651959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48651959", "title": "Rizin Fighting Federation", "text": "Rizin Fighting Federation\n\nRizin Fighting Federation (Rizin FF) is a Japanese mixed martial arts organization created in 2015 by the former Pride Fighting Championships and Dream Stage Entertainment president Nobuyuki Sakakibara.\n\nThe inaugural Rizin FF was broadcast in North America by Spike TV. Other past and present broadcasters include SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation, Fuji Television, Fox Sports Brazil, Kix and Match TV. Rizin FF streams exclusively on digital on FITE TV in North America and Europe.\n\nThe precursors of RIZIN Fighting Federation were PRIDE (founded 1997, dissolved 2007), and DREAM (founded 2008, dissolved 2012). PRIDE was an original competitor of the UFC, largely considered to be the premier mixed martial arts organization worldwide, and produced many of the stars during the 'golden age' of MMA, who went on to become UFC champions and Hall of Famers. Once PRIDE was purchased by the UFC, they absorbed most of their contracted roster. Less than 1 year after PRIDE's final event, DREAM was founded. Most of the executives and staff from PRIDE sought to recreate the same philosophy and ambition that their former organization had. Upon the dissolution of HERO'S, Fighting and Entertainment Group collaborated with Dream Stage Entertainment to create DREAM. Despite running nearly 25 events across from 2008 until the end of 2012, and establishing partnerships with Shooto, M-1 Global, Elite XC, Strikeforce, ProElite, and ONE Championship, the promotion sunsetted in the summer of 2012.\n\nOn September 19, 2015 during event, it was announced that Nobuyuki Sakakibara had signed one of the most successful and famous heavyweights in history, former Pride Heavyweight Champion 'The Last Emperor' Fedor Emelianenko to headline his new promotion’s New Year’s Eve Show in Tokyo. Then, on October 8, 2015 The former President of Pride FC - Nobuyuki Sakakibara - held a press conference to announce his return to MMA with Rizin Fighting Federation. Sakakibara returned to mainstream MMA, along with Nobuhiko Takada and other former Pride FC employees. The concept of the event was to create a platform where all promotions and fighters can compete while keeping their diverse culture, customs and characteristics. With countless promotions existing globally, RIZIN seeks to gather top competitors to determine who is the best; not competing with existing organizations as a sole promotion. Rather, to structure a federation to host, hold and operate fights.\n\nAside from the previously announced presence of Emelianenko (who was speculated to fight against Jaideep Singh), Kazushi Sakuraba was announced to take on Shinya Aoki, as well as female competitors Gabi Garcia and RENA. Finally, the classic Grand Prix tournament was announced (held at 100kg or roughly 220lbs), with champions and competitors from Bellator, KSW, Jungle Fight, BAMMA, and King of Kings. Most notably, King Mo was announced to represent Bellator in the tournament. All bouts will take place in a ring under PRIDE rules. In attendance were Bellator president Scott Coker, and Spike TV executive Jon Slusser, with Coker stating that his promotion and network were fully committed to supporting RIZIN. Coker went on to say, \"There was a time not long ago where the best fighters in the world fought here in Japan four or five times a year.\" The winner of the Grand Prix was to take home the prize of $500,000. The 8-man bracket was officially finalized on November 30th, 2015, with other bouts also being announced shortly thereafter. \n\nKron Gracie (who's father Rickson competed at the inaugural PRIDE event) was announced to participate against Asen Yamamoto. Amongst the veterans in the Japanese scene, Tsuyoshi Kosaka would face James Thompson, and Akebono Tarō would face Bob Sapp. In the spirit of Japanese MMA, Sakakibara mentioned that he wanted to bring back every fighter that shined in PRIDE to the RIZIN ring, and even proposed a potential 'master class' for those who were over 45 years old, citing Dan Henderson as an example of someone who can still compete at that age. Sakakibara was quoted, \"My personal opinion is that athletes today don’t fight because of a few kilos. Because of two or three kilos, we can’t book a fight that could be very interesting. We want to change this mentality. Fans are missing many great fights, like Cris Cyborg and Ronda Rousey, because of a little difference in weight. We won’t force anyone to fight, of course, but if the athlete wants to fight despite a few kilos, we will promote the fight. Of course, always respecting the safety of the fighters.\" Initial plans for the annual schedule were to do at most four events per year, as opposed to the frequent schedule of the UFC, in order to build up the excitement and anticipation for RIZIN events - similar to the World Cup of soccer. Scheduled to take place on the 29th and 31st of December in 2015, the first event will commemorate PRIDE, and the second event will usher in the RIZIN era.\n\nIn December 2015, Rizin Fighting Federation hosted the first Rizin World Grand-Prix, a two-part 100 kg tournament held to find the \"world's best fighter\". The tournament was held over the course of two events, with eight fighters competing in an opening round and the four winners returning two days later for the final round. The second round of the tournament was broadcast in the United States and featured American fighter Muhammed Lawal winning the tournament by defeating Brett McDermott, Teodoras Aukstuolis, and Jiri Prochazka in the two-day event.\n\nOn July 16, 2016 Nobuyuki Sakakibara announced at a press conference that Rizin Fighting Federation will host a 16-man openweight tournament September 25 in Tokyo. Former PRIDE Grand Prix champion Mirko “Cro Cop” Filipovic and former PRIDE middleweight champion Wanderlei Silva to participate in the tournament. Despite the rubber-match not being realized due to an injury sustained by Silva, Mirko \"Cro Cop\" won the championship, defeating Hyun Man Myung, King Mo, Baruto, and Amir Aliakbari all via stoppage.\n\nAfter the event in April, Nobuyuki Sakakibara announced that they will host a women Super Atomweight 49kg Grand Prix, Bantamweight 61kg Grand Prix, as well as a one-night 4-man kickboxing tournament on New Years. Former UFC title challenger Kyoji Horiguchi finished all of his opponents en-route to winning the championship, and Kanna Asakura caused an upset in the tournament, defeating RENA in the finals to become the first ever RIZIN women's champion. Kickboxing sensation Tenshin Nasukawa knocked out both of his opponents to win the kickboxing tournament.\n\nRizin FF is affiliated with the following organizations:\n\n\n"}

It is the third incarnation of the franchise. It is also the only series of the franchise to air on primetime television instead of Saturday mornings. It aired on NBC on Tuesday evenings. \n\n\"Saved by the Bell: The College Years\" is very similar to the original \"Saved by the Bell\" series; the plotline has to do with the six characters getting into trouble each week at the fictitious California University (Cal U), under the watchful eye of Mike Rogers (Bob Golic), their dorm adviser. The series includes Zack Morris, Samuel \"Screech\" Powers, and A.C. Slater (from the original \"Saved by the Bell\" series) as the main characters, along with newcomers Leslie Burke (Anne Tremko), Alex Tabor (Kiersten Warren) and Danielle Marks (Essence Atkins). After the pilot, however, Atkins's role was eliminated, and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen returned to the show in her role of Kelly Kapowski. Danielle was written out of the series as having transferred to another college.\n\nDuring the first and second episodes, the series centers around Zack's schemes to try to get Leslie, who despises Zack due to his sneaky schemes, to fall for him. Later, when Kelly decides to transfer to Cal U, Zack has to make a decision about who he really loves, as he still has feelings for Kelly. When Kelly and Leslie find out about Zack secretly liking both of them, they decide to both dump him. Starting with the third episode, the plotline becomes more centered around the whole gang, instead of just Leslie and Zack, and their various college issues.\n\nIn the beginning of the series, dorm adviser Mike Rogers is portrayed as tough-as-nails, although later in the series, he becomes softer and takes a liking to the kids. Mike played for the San Francisco 49ers at one point, but later decided to quit to become the Cal U dorm adviser. In one episode, he tries to train so he could play football again, but decides it was too much work and stays with his current job. Beginning with episode 15 (\"The Rave\"), Holland Taylor became involved with the series, portraying a Mr. Belding-type character named Dean McMann. She takes the role of the tough-as-nails authority figure that Mike originally was to be at the beginning of the series. Like Mr. Belding, she takes a disliking to Zack's schemes and often punishes him in various ways because of his antics.\n\nAn overarching theme of the series is Zack's efforts to win back the affection of Kelly, who is in love with their anthropology professor Jeremiah Lasky (Patrick Fabian). Eventually, Zack wins Kelly over again, and they become engaged.\n\nThe series was cancelled after only one season, due to low ratings, averaging only a 7.8/12 rating/share, and ranking 88th out of 118 shows in the yearly ratings. It had to deal with huge competition from both \"Full House\" and the first half of \"Rescue 911\", both of which ranked in the Nielsen Top 30 that season. Only 19 episodes were produced. Episode 19 (\"Wedding Plans\") left the series with a cliffhanger ending, where Zack and Kelly had not yet gotten married. To give closure to the series, a 90-minute TV movie, \"\", was produced to wrap up the series. All the main actors agreed to come back for the movie, except Anne Tremko, who declined a role in the movie. This series was the last to feature main characters Zack Morris, A.C. Slater and Kelly Kapowski, except for occasional appearances from Zack and Slater in \"\". Zack, Slater and Lisa (who only appeared in episodes 19 and 20) all appeared again in \"Goodbye Bayside: Part 2,\" which marked the last appearance to date of Zack and Lisa. Slater appeared one more time in \"Fire at the Max: Part 2\" of \"The New Class\". Kelly never again appeared after \"Wedding in Las Vegas.\" Screech, however, would return in \"The New Class\" seasons 2–7 as Mr. Belding's administrative assistant on a work-study program from Cal U.\n\n\n\"Saved by the Bell: The College Years\" was released on DVD in Region 1 by Image Entertainment on August 17, 2004. As of 2010, this release has been discontinued and is out of print.\n\nFour novelizations based on the show were released in late 1994 by the publisher Aladdin Paperbacks, all written by Beth Cruise. The books all feature the main cast and have similar storylines that relate to the main plots in the TV sequel.\n"}

Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, incongruity, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations and expressions of nonsense.\n\nThe humour arises from a subversion of audience's expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. The humour derived gets its appeal from the ridiculousness and unlikeliness of the situation. The genre has roots in Surrealism in the arts.\n\nSurreal humour is the effect of illogic and absurdity being used for humorous effect. Under such premises, people can identify precursors and early examples of surreal humour at least since the 19th century, such as Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass\", which both use illogic and absurdity (hookah-smoking caterpillars, croquet matches using live flamingos as mallets, etc.) for humorous effect. Many of Edward Lear's children stories and poems contain nonsense and are basically surreal in approach. For example, \"The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Round the World\" (1871) is filled with contradictory statements and odd images intended to provoke amusement, such as the following:\nIn the early 20th century, several avant-garde movements, including the dadaists, surrealists, and futurists began to argue for an art that was random, jarring and illogical. The goals of these movements were in some sense serious, and they were committed to undermining the solemnity and self-satisfaction of the contemporary artistic establishment. As a result, much of their art was intentionally amusing.\n\nA famous example is Marcel Duchamp's \"Fountain\" (1917), an inverted urinal signed \"R. Mutt\". This became one of the most famous and influential pieces of art in history, and one of the earliest examples of the found object movement. It is also a joke, relying on the inversion of the item's function as expressed by its title as well as its incongruous presence in an art exhibition.\nThe word \"surreal\" first began to be used to describe a type of aesthetic of the early 1920s.\n\nSurreal humour is also found frequently in avant-garde theatre such as \"Waiting for Godot\" and \"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead\". In the United States, S. J. Perelman (1904-1979) has been identified as the first surrealist humour writer.\n\nSurrealist humour is predominantly approached in cinema where the suspension of disbelief can be stretched to absurd lengths by logically following the consequences of unlikely, reversed or exaggerated premises. Luis Buñuel is a principal exponent of this, especially in \"The Exterminating Angel\". Other examples include \"The Falls\" by Peter Greenaway, \"Free Time\" by The Bogus Group, and \"Brazil\" by Terry Gilliam.\n\nToday's Internet meme culture is also heavily influenced by surreal humor.\n\nDrs. Mary K. Rodgers and Diana Pien analysed the subject in an essay titled \"Elephants and Marshmallows\" (subtitled \"A Theoretical Synthesis of Incongruity-Resolution and Arousal Theories of humour\"), and wrote that \"jokes are nonsensical when they fail to completely resolve incongruities,\" and cited one of the many permutations of the elephant joke: \"Why did the elephant sit on the marshmallow?\" \"Because he didn't want to fall into the cup of hot chocolate.\"\n\n\"The joke is incompletely resolved in their opinion,\" noted Dr. Elliott Oring, \"because the situation is incompatible with the world as we know it.

The drama has been translated into English, Italian, Japanese, French, Danish, Hebrew, Czech, Slovenian, Dutch, Estonian, German, Spanish and other languages.\n\nThe play is set in a non-defined time in the home of Stomil and Eleonora, parents of Artur (student of medicine). The place is disorganized not only in the way it is furnished, but also through the complete lack of house rules and common values. Everyone can do whatever they want. In addition, many unneeded objects like baby carriage, old wedding dress, catafalque after Artur grandfather's death, can be found in there. It seems that \"perplexity\" may be the word that describes their lives best. Despite that Artur’s attempts are bound to fail, he tries to make rules and grant some things meaning. Artur tries to coax his grandmother to use catafalque, revolts against his father slovenliness and his mother’s double standard of morality. He himself wants to have a traditional wedding, however he fails. Artur when organising reception forgets about declaration of his feelings toward fiancee, so she thinks he’s indifferent and, in consequence, she claims she has an affair with Edek. Furthermore, his grandmother dies, and Artur is killed by Edek. Drama ends with tango that symbolizes simple, primitive, mass culture, which means those \"values\" won. Edek announces that he takes control over place and everyone has to follow his rules from now on.\n\n\"Tango\" tells the story about generation gap in contemporary society and how conformity, anarchy, entropy and formalism come into conflict between generations. It tries to focus on finding the answer whether there is any space for an intellectual in such community.\n\n"}

It is housed in a Soviet-era Neoclassical rotunda building built in 1939 on a hilltop overlooking Heroes' Square.\n\nThe history of the Tbilisi circus began in 1888, when the city was part of the Russian Empire. Its original big top building was destroyed in a fire in 1911 and the circus was moved to a former wine factory, before settling down, in 1939, in its present Neoclassical, Joseph Stalin-era building designed by Nikolay Neprintsev, Vladimer Urushadze, and Stepan Satunts. The building sit on a hill on the right bank of the Kura river, near what had been the end of the Georgian Military Road at the entrance of the city in the imperial era. The hill had also been known for a cast iron cross, named the Vera Cross after the historical neighborhood, erected in 1847 to commemorate the survival of the emperor Nicholas I in a road accident during his visit to the Caucasus in 1837. The cross was demolished and the area around it was organized into Heroes' Square under the rule of Lavrenti Beria in the 1930s. With its 2,000-seat capacity, the Tbilisi Circus was ranked among the largest circuses in the Soviet Union, alongside those of Moscow, Kiev, and Baku.\n\nA civil unrest and economic collapse in post-Soviet Georgia terminated the circus's heyday in the 1990s. The building fell into disrepair and its territory became notorious for \"after-hours\" street prostitution. In 2003, the Georgian tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili bought the circus and began an extensive reconstruction, but his involvement in the 2007 political crisis and death shortly thereafter stalled the renovations. His sister, Mzia Tortladze, was able to reopen the circus only in 2011. Since then, the circus has been playing to sellout crowds, bringing together troupes and performers from various parts of the world.\n\n"}

{"id": "173650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173650", "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari", "text": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\n\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari () is a 1920 German silent horror film, directed by Robert Wiene and written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer. Considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, it tells the story of an insane hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) to commit murders. The film features a dark and striking visual style, with sharp-pointed forms, oblique and curving lines, structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets.\n\nThe script was inspired by various experiences from the lives of Janowitz and Mayer, both pacifists who were left distrustful of authority after their experiences with the military during World War I. The film's design was handled by Hermann Warm, Walter Reimann and Walter Röhrig, who recommended a fantastic, graphic style over a naturalistic one. The film has been characterized as presenting themes on brutal and irrational authority; the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity; the subjective perception of reality; and the duality of human nature.\n\n\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" was released just as foreign film industries were easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I, so it was screened internationally. Accounts differ as to its financial and critical success upon release, but modern film critics and historians have largely praised it as a revolutionary film. Critic Roger Ebert called it arguably \"the first true horror film\", and film reviewer Danny Peary called it cinema's first cult film and a precursor to arthouse films. Considered a classic, it helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema and had a major influence on American films, particularly in the genres of horror and film noir, introducing techniques such as the twist ending and the unreliable narrator to the language of narrative film.\n\nAs Francis (Friedrich Feher) sits on a bench with an older man who complains that spirits have driven him away from his family and home, a dazed woman named Jane (Lil Dagover) passes them. Francis explains she is his \"fiancée\" and that they have suffered a great ordeal. Most of the rest of the film is a flashback of Francis' story, which takes place in Holstenwall, a shadowy village of twisted buildings and spiraling streets. Francis and his friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski), who are good-naturedly competing for Jane's affections, plan to visit the town fair. Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) seeks a permit from the rude town clerk to present a spectacle at the fair, which features a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt). The clerk mocks and berates Dr. Caligari, but ultimately approves the permit. That night, the clerk is found stabbed to death in his bed.\n\nThe next morning, Francis and Alan visit Dr. Caligari's spectacle, where he opens a coffin-like box to reveal the sleeping Cesare. Upon Dr. Caligari's orders, Cesare awakens and answers questions from the audience. Despite Francis's protests, Alan asks, \"How long will I live?\" To Alan's horror, Cesare answers, \"Until dawn.\" Later that night, a figure breaks into Alan's home and stabs him to death in his bed. A grief-stricken Francis investigates Alan's murder with help from Jane and her father, Dr. Olsen (Rudolf Lettinger), who obtains police authorization to investigate the somnambulist. That night, the police apprehend a criminal in possession of a knife (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) who is caught attempting to murder an elderly woman. When questioned by Francis and Dr. Olson, the criminal confesses he tried to kill the elderly woman, but denies any part in the two previous deaths; he was merely taking advantage of the situation to divert blame onto the real murderer.\n\nAt night, Francis spies on Dr. Caligari and observes what appears to be Cesare sleeping in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis also confirms that the caught criminal has been locked away and could not have been the attacker. Francis and the police investigate Dr. Caligari's sideshow and realize that the 'Cesare' sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Dr. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows and sees Caligari go through the entrance of an insane asylum.\n\nUpon further investigation, Francis is shocked to learn that Dr. Caligari is the asylum's director. With help from the asylum staff, Francis studies the director's records and diary while the director is sleeping. The writings reveal his obsession with the story of an 18th-century mystic named Caligari, who used a somnambulist named Cesare to commit murders in northern Italian towns. The director, attempting to understand the earlier Caligari, experiments on a somnambulist admitted to the asylum, who becomes his Cesare. The director screams, \"I must become Caligari!\" Francis and the doctors call the police to Dr. Caligari's office, where they show him Cesare's corpse. Dr. Caligari then attacks one of the staff. He is subdued, restrained in a straitjacket, and becomes an inmate in his own asylum.\n\nThe narrative returns to the present, where Francis concludes his story. In a twist ending, Francis is depicted as an asylum inmate. Jane and Cesare are patients as well; Jane believes she is a queen, while Cesare is not a somnambulist but awake, quiet, and not visibly dangerous. The man Francis considers as \"Dr. Caligari\" is the asylum director. Francis attacks him and is restrained in a straitjacket, then placed in the same cell where Dr. Caligari was confined in Francis' story. The director announces that now he understands Francis' delusion. As such, he is confident he can cure him.\n\n\n\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" was written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer, both of whom were pacifists by the time they met following World War I. Janowitz served as an officer during the war, but the experience left him embittered with the military, which affected his writing. Mayer feigned madness to avoid military service during the war, which led him to intense examinations from a military psychiatrist. The experience left him distrustful of authority, and the psychiatrist served as a model for the Dr. Caligari character. Janowitz and Mayer were introduced in June 1918 by a mutual friend, actor Ernst Deutsch. Both writers were penniless at the time. Gilda Langer, an actress with whom Mayer was in love, encouraged Janowitz and Mayer to write a film together. She later became the basis for the Jane character. Langer also encouraged Janowitz to visit a fortune teller, who predicted that Janowitz would survive his military service during the war, but Langer would die. This prediction proved true, as Langer died unexpectedly in 1920 at age 23, and Janowitz said it inspired the scene in which Cesare predicts Alan's death at the fair.\n\nAlthough neither had any associations with the film industry, Janowitz and Mayer wrote a script over six weeks during the winter of 1918–19. In describing their roles, Janowitz called himself \"the father who planted the seed, and Mayer the mother who conceived and ripened it\". The Expressionist filmmaker Paul Wegener was among their influences. The story was partially inspired by a circus sideshow the two visited on Kantstrasse in Berlin, called \"Man or Machine?\", in which a man performed feats of great strength after becoming hypnotized. They first visualized the story of \"Caligari\" the night of that show. Several of Janowitz's past experiences influenced his writing, including memories of his hometown of Prague, and, as he put it, a mistrust of \"the authoritative power of an inhuman state gone mad\" due to his military service. Janowitz also believed he had witnessed a murder in 1913 near an amusement park on Hamburg's Reeperbahn, beside the Holstenwall, which served as another inspiration for the script. According to Janowitz, he observed a woman disappear into some bushes, from which a respectable-looking man emerged a few moments later, and the next day Janowitz learned the girl was murdered. Holstenwall later became the name of the town setting in \"Caligari\".\n\nJanowitz and Mayer are said to have set out to write a story denouncing arbitrary authority as brutal and insane. Janowitz said it was only years after the film was released that he realized exposing the \"authoritative power of an inhuman state\" was the \"subconscious intention\" of the writers. However, Hermann Warm, who designed the film's sets, said Mayer had no political intentions when he wrote the film. Film historian David Robinson noted Janowitz did not refer to anti-authority intentions in the script until many decades after \"Caligari\" was released, and he suggested Janowitz's recollection may have changed in response to later interpretations to the film. The film they wrote was entitled \"Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari\", using the English spelling \"Cabinet\" rather than the German \"Kabinett\". The completed script contained 141 scenes. Janowitz has claimed the name \"Caligari\", which was not settled upon until after the script was finished, was inspired by a rare book called ‘’Unknown Letters of Stendhal'’, which featured a letter from the French novelist Stendhal referring to a French officer named Caligari he met at the La Scala theatre in Milan. However, no record of any such letter exists, and film historian John D. Barlow suggested Janowitz may have fabricated the story. The physical appearance of Dr. Caligari was inspired by portraits of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. The character's name is spelled \"Calligaris\" in the only known surviving script, although in some instances the final \"s\" is removed. Other character names are also spelled differently from the final film: Cesare appears as \"Caesare\", Alan is \"Allan\" or sometimes \"Alland\" and Dr. Olfen is \"Dr. Olfens\". Likewise, unnamed characters in the final film have names in the script, including the town clerk (\"Dr. Lüders\") and the house-breaker (\"Jakob Straat\").\n\nThe story of \"Caligari\" is told abstractly, like a fairy tale, and includes little description about or attention toward the psychological motivations of the characters, which is more heavily emphasized in the film's visual style. The original script shows few traces of the Expressionist influence prevalent in the film's sets and costumes. Through film director Fritz Lang, Janowitz and Mayer met with Erich Pommer, head of production at the Decla-Bioscop film studio, on 19 April 1919, to discuss selling the script. According to Pommer, he attempted to get rid of them, but they persisted until he agreed to meet with them. Pommer reportedly asked the writers to leave the script with him, but they refused, and instead Mayer read it aloud to him. Pommer and his assistant, Julius Sternheim, were so impressed that he refused to let them leave until a contract was signed, and he purchased the script from them that night. The writers had originally sought no fewer than 10,000 marks, but were given 3,500, with the promise of another 2,000 once the film went into production and 500 if it was sold for foreign release, which the producers considered unlikely. The contract, today preserved at Berlin's Bundesfilmarchiv, gave Pommer the right to make any changes to the script deemed appropriate. Pommer said he was drawn to the script because he believed it could be filmed inexpensively, and it bore similarities to films inspired by the macabre horror shows of the Grand Guignol theatre in Paris, which were popular at the time. Pommer later said: \"They saw in the script an 'experiment'. I saw a relatively cheap film\".\n\n\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" makes use of a \"Rahmenerzählung\", or frame story. Both a prologue and epilogue establish the main body of the film as a delusional flashback, an innovative technique at the time. Lang has said that, during early discussions about his possible involvement with the film, he suggested the addition of an opening scene with a \"normal\" style, which would lead the public into the rest of the film without confusion. However, it remains unclear whether Lang suggested the frame story structure itself, or simply gave advice on how to write a frame story that was already agreed upon, and some writers, like David Robinson, have questioned whether Lang's recollection is correct. Director Robert Wiene was supportive of the changes. Janowitz has claimed he and Mayer were not privy to discussions about adding the frame story and strongly opposed its inclusion, believing it had deprived the film of its revolutionary and political significance; he wrote that it was \"an illicit violation, a raping of our work\" that turned the film \"into a cliché ... in which the symbolism was to be lost\". Janowitz claims the writers sought legal action to stop the change, but were unsuccessful. He also claims they did not see the finished film with the frame story until a preview was shown to studio heads, after which the writers \"expressed our dissatisfaction in a storm of thunderous remonstrances\". They had to be persuaded not to publicly protest the film.\n\nIn his 1947 book \"From Caligari to Hitler\", Siegfried Kracauer argued, based largely on an unpublished typescript written and provided by Janowitz, that the film originally included no frame story at all and only the main story, starting with the fair coming to town and ending with Dr. Caligari becoming institutionalized. Kracauer argued the frame story glorified authority and was added to turn a \"revolutionary\" film into a \"conformistic\" one. (See the Themes section for more.) No surviving copies of the script were believed to exist to confirm this fact, until the early 1950s when actor Werner Krauss revealed he still had his copy. Krauss refused to part with it, and it was not until 1978, after his death, that it was purchased by the German film archive Deutsche Kinemathek. It remained unavailable for public consumption until 1995, when a full transcript was published.\n\nThe script revealed that a frame story indeed was part of the original \"Caligari\" screenplay, albeit a significantly different one than that in the final film. The original manuscript opens on an elegant terrace of a large villa, where Francis and Jane are hosting a party, and the guests insist that Francis tell them a story that happened to him 20 years earlier. The conclusion to the frame story is missing from the script. Critics widely agree that the discovery of the screenplay strongly undermines Kracauer's theory, with some, like German film historian Stephen Brockmann, even arguing it disproves his claims altogether. Others, however, like John D. Barlow, argues it does not completely settle the issue, as the original screenplay's frame story simply serves to introduce the main plot, rather than subvert it as the final film's version does.\n\nMany details about the making of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" are in dispute and will probably remain unsettled due to the large number of people involved in the making of the film, many of whom have recalled it differently or dramatized their own contributions to its production. Production of the film was delayed about four or five months after the script was purchased. Pommer originally chose Lang as the director of \"Caligari\", and Lang even went so far as to hold preparatory discussions about the script with Janowitz, but he became unavailable due to his involvement with the filming of \"The Spiders\", so Wiene was selected instead. According to Janowitz, Wiene's father, a successful theatre actor, had \"gone slightly mad when he could no longer appear on the stage\", and Janowitz believed that experience helped Wiene bring an \"intimate understanding\" to the source material of \"Caligari\".\nDecla producer Rudolf Meinert introduced Hermann Warm to Wiene and provided Warm the \"Caligari\" script, asking him to come up with proposals for the design. Warm believed \"films must be drawings brought to life\", and felt a naturalistic set was wrong for the subject of the film, instead recommending a fantastic, graphic style, in which the images would be visionary, nightmarish and out of the ordinary. Warm brought to the project his two friends, painters and stage designers Walter Reimann and Walter Röhrig, both of whom were associated with the Berlin art and literary magazine \"Der Sturm\". The trio spent a full day and part of the night reading the script, after which Reimann suggested an Expressionist style, a style often used in his own paintings. They also conceived the idea of painting forms and shadows directly onto the sets to ensure a dark and unreal look. (See Visual Style for more.) According to Warm, the three approached Wiene with the idea and he immediately agreed, although Wiene has made claims that he conceived the film's Expressionist style. Meinert agreed to the idea after one day's consideration, telling Warm, Reimann and Röhrig to make the sets as \"crazy\" and \"eccentrically\" as possible. He embraced the idea for commercial, not aesthetic reasons: Expressionism was fashionable at the time, so he concluded even if film received bad reviews, the artistic style would garner attention and make it profitable.\n\nWiene filmed a test scene to demonstrate Warm, Reimann, and Röhrig's theories, and it so impressed the producers that the artists were given free rein. Pommer later said he was responsible for placing Warm, Reimann and Röhrig in charge of the sets. But Warm has claimed that, although Pommer was in charge of production at Decla when \"Caligari\" was made, he was not actually a producer on the film itself. Instead, he says Meinert was the film's true producer, and that it was he who gave Warm the manuscript. Warm claimed Meinert produced the film \"despite the opposition of a part of the management of Decla.\" Meinert said Pommer had \"not sanctioned\" the film's abstract visual style. Nevertheless, Pommer claimed to have supervised \"Caligari\", and that the film's Expressionistic style was chosen in part to differentiate it from competing Hollywood films. The predominant attitude at the time was that artistic achievement led to success in exports to foreign film markets. The dominance of Hollywood at the time, coupled with a period of inflation and currency devaluation, forced German film studios to seek projects that could be made inexpensively, with a combination of realistic and artistic elements so the films would be accessible to American audiences, yet also distinctive from Hollywood films. Pommer has claimed while Mayer and Janowitz expressed a desire for artistic experimentation in the film, his decision to use painted canvases as scenery was primarily a commercial one, as they would be a significant financial saving over building sets.\n\nJanowitz claims he attempted to commission the sets from designer and engraver Alfred Kubin, known for his heavy use of light and shadow to create a sense of chaos, but Kubin declined to participate in the project because he was too busy. In a conflicting story, however, Janowitz claimed he requested from Decla \"Kubin paintings\", and that they misread his instructions as \"cubist painters\" and hired Reimann and Röhrig as a result. David Robinson argues this story was probably an embellishment stemming from Janowitz's disdain for the two artists. Janowitz has claimed that he and Mayer conceived the idea of painting the sets on canvas, and that the shooting script included written directions that the scenery be designed in Kubin's style. However, the later rediscovery of the original screenplay refutes this claim, as it includes no such directions about the sets. This was also disputed in a 1926 article by Barnet Braverman in \"Billboard\" magazine, which claimed the script included no mention of an unconventional visual style, and that Janowitz and Mayer in fact strongly opposed the stylization. She claims Mayer later came to appreciate the visual style, but that Janowitz remained opposed to it years after the film's release.\n\nThe set design, costumes and props took about two weeks to prepare. Warm worked primarily on the sets, while Röhrig handled the painting and Reimann was responsible for the costumes. Robinson noted the costumes in \"Caligari\" seem to resemble a wide variety of time periods. For example, Dr. Caligari and the fairground workers' costumes resemble the Biedermeier era, while Jane's embody Romanticism. Additionally, Robinson wrote, Cesare's costume and those of policemen in the film appear abstract, while many of the other characters seem like ordinary German clothes from the 1920s. The collaborative nature of the film's production highlights the importance that both screenwriters and set designers held in German cinema of the 1920s, although film critic Lotte H. Eisner said sets held more importance than anything else in German films at that time. \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" was the first German Expressionist film, although Brockmann and film critic Mike Budd claims it was also influenced by German Romanticism; Budd notes the film's themes of insanity and the outcry against authority are common among German Romanticism in literature, theatre and the visual arts. Film scholar Vincent LoBrutto said the theatre of Max Reinhardt and the artistic style of Die Brücke were additional influences on \"Caligari\".\n\nJanowitz originally intended the part of Cesare to go to his friend, actor Ernst Deutsch. Mayer wrote the part of Jane for Gilda Langer, but by the time the film was cast Langer's interests had moved on from Janowitz and Mayer to director Paul Czinner, leaving the role to be played by Lil Dagover. Janowitz claimed he wrote the part of Dr. Caligari specifically for Werner Krauss, whom Deutsch had brought to his attention during rehearsals for a Max Reinhardt play; Janowitz said only Krauss or Paul Wegener could have played the part. The parts of Dr. Caligari and Cesare ultimately went to Krauss and Conrad Veidt, respectively, who enthusiastically took part in many aspects of the production. Krauss suggested changes to his own make-up and costumes, including the elements of a top hat, cape, and walking stick with an ivory handle for his character. The actors in \"Caligari\" were conscious of the need to adapt their make-up, costumes, and appearance to match the visual style of the film. Much of the acting in German silent films at the time was already Expressionistic, mimicking the pantomimic aspects of Expressionist theatre. The performances of Krauss and Veidt in \"Caligari\" were typical of this style, as they both had experience in Expressionist-influenced theatre, and as a result John D. Barlow said they appear more comfortable in their surroundings in the film than the other actors. Prior to filming, Kraus and Veidt appeared on stage in the winter of 1918 in an Expressionist drama, Reinhold Goering's \"Seeschlacht\", at the Deutsches Theater. By contrast, Dagover had little experience in Expressionist theatre, and Barlow argues her acting is less harmonious with the film's visual style.\n\nWiene asked the actors to make movements similar to dance, most prominently from Veidt, but also from Krauss, Dagover and Friedrich Feger, who played Francis. Krauss and Veidt are the only actors whose performances fully match the stylization of the sets, which they achieved by concentrating their movements and facial expressions. Barlow notes that \"Veidt moves along the wall as if it had 'exuded' him ... more a part of a material world of objects than a human one\", and Krauss \"moves with angular viciousness, his gestures seem broken or cracked by the obsessive force within him, a force that seems to emerge from a constant toxic state, a twisted authoritarianism of no human scruple and total insensibility\". Most of the other actors besides Krauss and Veidt have a more naturalistic style. Alan, Jane and Francis play the roles of an idyllically happy trio enjoying youth; Alan in particular represents the archetype of a sensitive 19th century student. Mike Budd points out realist characters in stylized settings are a common characteristic in Expressionist theatre. However, David Robinson notes even the performances of the more naturalistic supporting roles in \"Caligari\" have Expressionist elements, like Hans-Heinz von Twardowski's \"strange, tormented face\" as Alan. He also cites Feher's \"large angular movements,\" especially in the scene where he searches the deserted fairground. Other minor roles are Expressionistic in nature, like two policemen who sit facing each other at their desks and move with exaggerated symmetry, and two servants who awaken and rise from their beds in perfect synchronization. Vincent LoBrutto said of the acting in the film:\n\nShooting for \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" began at the end of December 1919 and concluded at the end of January 1920. It was shot entirely in a studio without any exterior shots, which was unusual for films of the time, but dictated by the decision to give the film an Expressionist visual style. The extent to which Mayer and Janowitz participated during filming is disputed: Janowitz claims the duo repeatedly refused to allow any script changes during production, and Pommer claimed Mayer was on the set for every day of filming. But Hermann Warm claimed they were never present for any of the shooting or involved in any discussions during production.\n\n\"Caligari\" was filmed in the Lixie-Atelier film studio (formerly owned by Continental-Kunstfilm) at 9 Franz Joseph-Strasse (now Max Liebermannstraße), Weißensee, a north-eastern suburb of Berlin. Decla had been making films at the Lixie studio since October 1919, having previously released three titles, \"Die Pest in Florenz\" (1919) and the two parts of Fritz Lang's \"The Spiders\" (\"Die Spinnen\"). The relatively small size of the studio (built some five years earlier in 1914) meant most of the sets used in the film do not exceed six meters in width and depth. Certain elements from the original script had to be cut from the film due to the limited space, including a procession of gypsies, a handcart pushed by Dr. Caligari, Jane's carriage, and a chase scene involving horse-cabs. Likewise, the script called for a fairground scene with roundabouts, barrel organs, sideshow barkers, performers and menageries, none of which could be achieved in the restrictive space. Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; throngs of people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates the impression of a carnival. The script also made references to modern elements like telephones, telegrams and electric light, but they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with no indication of a specific time period.\n\nSeveral scenes from the script were cut during filming, most of which were brief time lapses or transitioning scenes, or title screens deemed unnecessary. One of the more substantial scenes to be cut involved the ghost of Alan at a cemetery. The scene with the town clerk berating Dr. Caligari deviated notably from the original script, which simply called for the clerk to be \"impatient\". He is far more abusive in the scene as it was filmed, and is perched atop an exaggeratedly high bench that towers over Dr. Caligari. Another deviation from the script comes when Dr. Caligari first awakens Cesare, one of the most famous moments in the film. The script called for Cesare to gasp and struggle for air, then shake violently and collapse in Dr. Caligari's arms. As it was filmed, there is no such physical struggling, and instead the camera zooms in on Cesare's face as he gradually opens his eyes. The original title cards for \"Caligari\" featured stylized, misshapen lettering with excessive underlinings, exclamation points and occasionally archaic spellings. The bizarre style, which matches that of the film as a whole, mimics the lettering of Expressionistic posters at the time. The original title cards were tinted in green, steely-blue and brown. Many modern prints of the film do not preserve the original lettering.\n\nPhotography was provided by Willy Hameister, who went on to work with Wiene on several other films. The camera does not play a large part in \"Caligari\", and is used primarily to show the sets. The cinematography tends to alternate only between medium shots at straight-on angles and abrupt close-ups to create a sense of shock, but with few long shots or panning movement. Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without intercutting, which gives \"Caligari\" a more theatrical feel than a cinematic one. Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to intensify the uneasiness created by the distortions of the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create an unsettling glow. Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to cast a shadow against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films.\n\nThe visual style of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" is dark, twisted and bizarre; radical and deliberate distortions in perspective, form, dimension and scale create a chaotic and unhinged appearance. The sets are dominated by sharp-pointed forms and oblique and curving lines, with narrow and spiraling streets, and structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, giving the impression they could collapse or explode at any given moment. Film critic Roger Ebert described it as \"a jagged landscape of sharp angles and tilted walls and windows, staircases climbing crazy diagonals, trees with spiky leaves, grass that looks like knives\". The sets are characterized by strokes of bold, black paint. The landscape of Holstenwall is painted on canvas, as opposed to a constructed set, and shadows and streaks of light are painted directly onto the sets, further distorting the viewer's sense of perspective and three-dimensionality. Buildings are clustered and interconnected in a cubist-like architecture, surrounded by dark and twisted back alleys. Lotte Eisner, author of \"The Haunted Screen\", writes that objects in the film appear as if they are coming alive and \"seem to vibrate with an extraordinary spirituality\". Likewise, \"Expressionismus und Film\" writer Rudolf Kurtz wrote \"the dynamic force of objects howls their desire to be created\". The rooms have radically offset windows with distorted frames, doors that are not squared, and chairs that are too tall. Strange designs and figures are painted on the walls of corridors and rooms, and trees outside have twisted branches that sometimes resemble tentacles.\n\nAs German film professor Anton Kaes wrote, \"The style of German Expressionism allowed the filmmakers to experiment with filmic technology and special effects and to explore the twisted realm of repressed desires, unconscious fears, and deranged fixations\". The visual style of \"Caligari\" conveys a sense of anxiety and terror to the viewer, giving the impression of a nightmare or deranged sensibility, or a place transformed by evil, in a more effective way than realistic locations or conventional design concepts could. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the settings \"amounted to a perfect transformation of material objects into emotional ornaments\". The majority of the film's story and scenes are memories recalled by an insane narrator, and as a result the distorted visual style takes on the quality of his mental breakdown, giving the viewers the impression that they are inside the mind of a madman. As with German Expressionist paintings, the visual style of \"Caligari\" reflects an emotional reaction to world, and in the case of the film's characters represents an emotional response to the terror of society that Dr. Caligari and Cesare represent. Often in the film, set pieces are emblematic of the emotional state of the characters in the scene. For example, the courtyard of the insane asylum during the frame story is vastly out of proportion. The characters seem too big for the small building, and the courtyard floor features a bizarre pattern, all of which represent the patients' damaged frames of mind. Likewise, the scene with the criminal in a prison cell features a set with long vertical painted shadows resembling arrowheads, pointing down at the squatting prisoner in an oppressive effect that symbolizes his broken-down state.\n\nStephen Brockmann argues the fact that \"Caligari\" was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because \"there is no access to a natural world beyond the realm of the tortured human psyche\". The sets occasionally feature circular images that reflect the chaos of the film, presenting patterns of movement that seem to be going nowhere, such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing. Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Dr. Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks. They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes, making them appear as if they are the only ones who truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background.\n\nA select few scenes disrupt the Expressionistic style of the film, such as in Jane's and Alan's home, which include normal backgrounds and bourgeois furniture that convey a sense of security and tranquility otherwise absent from the film. Eisner called this a \"fatal\" continuity error, but John D. Barlow disagrees, arguing it is a common characteristic for dream narratives to have some normal elements in them, and that the normalcy of Jane's house in particular could represent the feeling of comfort and refuge Francis feels in her presence. Mike Budd argues while the Expressionistic visual style is jarring and off-putting at first, the characters start to blend more harmoniously as the film progresses, and the setting becomes more relegated into the background.\n\nRobinson suggested \"Caligari\" is not a true example of Expressionism at all, but simply a conventional story with some elements of the art form applied to it. He argues the story itself is not Expressionistic, and the film could have easily been produced in a traditional style, but that Expressionist-inspired visuals were applied to it as decoration. Similarly, Budd has called the film a conventional, classical narrative, resembling a detective story in Francis's search to expose Alan's killer, and said it is only the film's Expressionist settings that make the film transgressive. Hans Janowitz has entertained similar thoughts as well: \"Was this particular style of painting only a garment in which to dress the drama? Was it only an accident? Would it not have been possible to change this garment, without injury to the deep effect of the drama? I do not know.\"\n\nThough often considered an art film by modern audiences, \"Caligari\" was produced and marketed the same way as a normal commercial production of its time period, able to target both the elite artistic market as well as a more commercial horror genre audience. The film was marketed extensively leading up to the release, and advertisements ran even before the film was finished. Many posters and newspaper advertisements included the enigmatic phrase featured in the film, \"Du musst Caligari werden!\", or \"You must become Caligari!\" \"Caligari\" premiered at the Marmorhaus theatre in Berlin on 26 February 1920, less than one month after it was completed. The filmmakers were so nervous about the release that Erich Pommer, on his way to the theatre, reportedly exclaimed, \"It will be a horrible failure for all of us!\" As with the making of the film, several urban legends surround the film's premiere. One, offered by writers Roger Manvell and Heinrich Fraenkel in \"The German Cinema\", suggest the film was shelved \"for lack of a suitable outlet\", and was only shown at Marmorhaus because another film had fallen through. Another suggested the theatre pulled the film after only two performances because audiences demanded refunds and demonstrated against it so strongly. This story was told by Pommer, who claimed the Marmorhaus picked \"Caligari\" back up and ran it successfully for three months after he spent six months working on a publicity campaign for the film. David Robinson wrote that neither of these urban legends were true, and that the latter was fabricated by Pommer to increase his own reputation. On the contrary, Robinson said the premiere was highly successful, showing at the theatre for four weeks, an unusual amount for the time, and then returning two weeks later. He said it was so well received that women in the audience screamed when Cesare opened his eyes during his first scene, and fainted during the scene in which Cesare abducts Jane.\n\n\"Caligari\" was released at a time when foreign film industries had just started easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I. The film was acquired for American distribution by the Goldwyn Distributing Company, and had its American premiere at the Capitol Theatre on 3 April 1921. It was given a live theatrical prologue and epilogue, which was not unusual for film premieres at major theatres at the time. In the prologue, the film is introduced by a character called \"Cranford\", who identifies himself as the man Francis speaks with in the opening scene. In the epilogue, Cranford returns and exclaims that Francis has fully recovered from his madness. Mike Budd believes these additions simplified the film and \"adjusted [it] for mass consumption\", though Robinson argued it was simply a normal theatrical novelty for the time. Capitol Theatre runner Samuel Roxy Rothafel commissioned conductor Ernö Rapée to compile a musical accompaniment that included portions of songs by composers Johann Strauss III, Arnold Schoenberg, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Rotafel wanted the score to match the dark mood of the film, saying: \"The music had, as it were, to be made eligible for citizenship in a nightmare country\".\n\n\"Caligari\" had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but the theatre was forced to pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was organized by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over objections to the content of \"Caligari\" itself. After running in large commercial theatres, \"Caligari\" began to be shown in smaller theatres and film societies in major cities. Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it has been difficult to assess the commercial success or failure of \"Caligari\" in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; with Thompson concluding it was a box office success and Pratt concluding it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative.\n\n\"Caligari\" did not immediately receive a wide distribution in France due to fears over the import of German films, but film director Louis Delluc organized a single screening of it on 14 November 1921, at the Colisée cinema in Paris as part of a benefit performance for the Spanish Red Cross. Afterward, the Cosmograph company bought the film's distribution rights and premiered it at the Ciné-Opéra on 2 March 1922. \"Caligari\" played in one Paris theatre for seven consecutive years, a record that remained intact until the release of \"Emmanuelle\" (1974). According to Janowitz, \"Caligari\" was also shown in such European cities as London, Rome, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Bucharest, as well as other countries like China, Japan, India, Turkey and South American nations.\n\nThere are differing accounts as to how \"Caligari\" was first received by audiences and critics immediately after its release. Stephen Brockmann, Anton Kaes and film theorist Kristin Thompson say it was popular with both the general public and well-respected by critics. Robinson wrote, \"The German critics, almost without exception, ranged from favourable to ecstatic\". Kracauer said critics were \"unanimous in praising \"Caligari\" as the first work of art on the screen\", but also said it was \"too high-brow to become popular in Germany\". Barlow said it was often the subject of critical disapproval, which he believes is because early film reviewers attempted to assign fixed definitions to the young art of cinema, and thus had trouble accepting the bizarre and unusual elements of \"Caligari\". Some critics felt it imitated a stage production too closely. Other commentators, like critic Herbert Jhering and novelist Blaise Cendrars, objected to the presentation of the story as a madman's delusion because they felt it belittled Expressionism as an artform. Theatre critic Helmut Grosse condemned the film's visual design as clichéd and derivative, calling it a \"cartoon and (a) reproduction of designs rather than from what actually took place on stage\". Several reviewers, like Kurt Tucholsky and Blaise Cendrars, criticized the use of real actors in front of artificially-painted sets, saying it created an inconsistent level of stylization. Critic Herbert Ihering echoed this point in a 1920 review: \"If actors are acting without energy and are playing within landscapes and rooms which are formally 'excessive', the continuity of the principle is missing\".\n\nWhile Robinson said the response from American critics was largely positive and enthusiastic, Kaes said American critics and audiences were divided: some praised its artistic value and others, particularly those distrustful of Germany following World War I, wished to ban it altogether. Some in the Hollywood film industry felt threatened by the potential rivalry and spoke out against \"Caligari\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, condemning it as a \"foreign invasion\". Nevertheless, the film remained popular in the United States. Several American reviewers compared it to an Edgar Allan Poe story, including a 1921 review in \"Variety\" magazine, which praised the direction and \"perfect tempo\" of the film, as well as the sets that \"squeeze and turn and adjust the eye, and through the eye the mentality\". A \"New York Times\" review likened it to modernist art, comparing the film's sets to Marcel Duchamp's \"Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\", and said the film \"gives dimensions and meaning to shape, making it an active part of the story, instead of merely the conventional and inert background\", which was key to the film's \"importance as a work of cinematography\". Albert Lewin, a critic who eventually became a film director and screenwriter, called \"Caligari\" \"the only serious picture, exhibited in America so far, that in anything like the same degree has the authentic thrills and shock of art\". A story in a November 1921 edition of \"Exceptional Photoplays\", an independent publication issued by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, said it \"occupies the position of unique artistic merit\", and said American films in comparison looked like they were made for \"a group of defective adults at the nine-year-old level\".\n\n\"Caligari\" was a critical success in France, but French filmmakers were divided in their opinions after its release. Abel Gance called it \"superb\" and wrote, \"What a lesson to all directors!\" and René Clair said \"overthrew the realist dogma\" of filmmaking. Film critic and director Louis Delluc said the film has a compelling rhythm: \"At first slow, deliberately laborious, it attempts to irritate. Then when the zigzag motifs of the fairground start turning, the pace leaps forward, agitato, accelerando, and leaves off only at the word 'End', as abruptly as a slap in the face.\" Jean Epstein, however, called it \"a prize example of the abuse of décor in the cinema\" and said it \"represents a grave sickness of cinema\". Likewise, Jean Cocteau called it \"the first step towards a grave error which consists of flat photography of eccentric decors, instead of obtaining surprise by means of the camera\". French critic Frédéric-Philippe Amiguet wrote of the film: \"It has the odor of tainted food. It leaves a taste of cinders in the mouth.\" The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein especially disliked \"Caligari\", calling it a \"combination of silent hysteria, partially coloured canvases, daubed flats, painted faces, and the unnatural broken gestures and action of monstrous chimaeras\".\n\nWhile early reviews were more divided, modern film critics and historians have largely praised \"Caligari\" as a revolutionary film. Film reviewer Roger Ebert called it arguably \"the first true horror film\", and critic Danny Peary called it cinema's first cult film and a precursor for arthouse films. In October 1958, \"Caligari\" was ranked as the twelfth-best film of all time during a poll organized at the Brussels World’s Fair. With input from 117 film critics, filmmakers and historians from around the world, it was the first universal film poll in history. American film historian Lewis Jacobs said \"its stylized rendition, brooding quality, lack of explanation, and distorted settings were new to the film world\". Film historian and critic Paul Rotha wrote of it, \"For the first time in the history of the cinema, the director has worked \"through\" the camera and broken with realism on the screen; that a film could be effective dramatically when not photographic and finally, of the greatest possible importance, that the mind of the audience was brought into play psychologically\". Likewise, Arthur Knight wrote in \"Rogue\": \"More than any other film, (\"Caligari\") convinced artists, critics and audiences that the movie was a medium for artistic expression\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" included \"Caligari\" in their 1994 \"Guide to the Greatest Movies Ever Made\", calling it a \"landmark silent film\" and saying, \"No other film's art direction has ever come up with so original a visualization of dementia\". It holds a rare 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 48 reviews.\n\n\"Caligari\" is considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, and by far the most famous example of it. It is considered a classic film, often shown in introductory film courses, film societies and museums, and is one of the most famous German films from the silent era. Film scholar Lewis Jacobs called it \"most widely discussed film of the time\". \"Caligari\" helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema, while also bringing legitimacy to the cinema among literary intellectuals within Germany itself. Lotte Eisner has said it was in Expressionism, as epitomized in \"Caligari\", that \"the German cinema found its true nature.\" The term \"caligarism\" was coined as a result, referring to a style of similar films that focus on such themes as bizarre madness and obsession, particularly through the use of visual distortion. Expressionism was late in coming to cinema, and by the time \"Caligari\" was released, many German critics felt the art form had become commercialized and trivialized; such well-known writers as Kasimir Edschmid, René Schickele, and Yvan Goll had already pronounced the Expressionist movement dead by the time \"Caligari\" arrived in theatres. Few other purely Expressionistic films were produced, and \"Caligari\" was the only one readily accessible for several decades. Among the few films to fully embrace the Expressionist style were \"Genuine\" (1920) and \"Raskolnikow\" (1923), both directed by Wiene, as well as \"From Morn to Midnight\" (1920), \"Torgus\" (1921), \"Das Haus zum Mond\" (1921), \"Haus ohne Tür und ohne Fenster\" (1921) and \"Waxworks\".\n\nWhile few other purely Expressionistic films were made, \"Caligari\" still had a major influence over other German directors, and many of the film's Expressionist elements – particularly the use of setting, light and shadow to represent the dark psychology of its characters – became prevalent in German cinema. Among the films to use these elements were Murnau's \"Nosferatu\" (1922) and \"The Last Laugh\" (1924), G. W. Pabst's \"Secrets of a Soul\" (1926), and Lang's \"Metropolis\" (1927) and \"M\" (1931). The success of \"Caligari\" also affected the way in which German films were produced during the 1920s. For example, the majority of major German films over the next few years moved away from location shooting and were fully filmed in studios, which assigned much more importance to designers in German cinema. Robinson argues this led to the rise of a large number of film designers – such as Hans Dreier, Rochus Gliese, Albin Grau, Otto Hunte, Alfred Junge, Erich Kettelhut and Paul Leni – and that effect was felt abroad as many of these talents later emigrated from Germany with the rise of the Nazi Party. Additionally, the success of \"Caligari\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s collaborative effort – including its director, set designers and actors – influenced subsequent film production in Germany for many years, making teamwork a hallmark of German cinema in the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe effect of \"Caligari\" was felt not just in German cinema, but internationally as well. Both Rotha and film historian William K. Everson wrote that the film probably had as much of a long-term effect on Hollywood directors as \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925). In his book \"The Film Til Now\", Rotha wrote that \"Caligari\" and \"Potemkin\" were the \"two most momentous advances in the development of the cinema\", and said \"Caligari\" \"served to attract to the cinema audience many people who had hitherto regarded the film as the low watermark of intelligence\". \"Caligari\" influenced the style and content of Hollywood films in the 1920s and early 1930s, particularly in films such as \"The Bells\" (1926), \"The Man Who Laughs\" (1928) and \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1932), and had a major influence on American horror films of the 1930s, some of which featured an antagonist using Caligari-like supernatural abilities to control others, such as \"Dracula\" (1931), \"Svengali\" (1931) and \"The Mad Genius\" (1931). Kaes said both \"Caligari\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s stylistic elements, and the Cesare character in particular, influenced the Universal Studios horror films of the 1930s, which often prominently featured some sort of monster, such as \"Frankenstein\" (1931), \"The Mummy\" (1932), \"The Black Cat\" (1934), and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935). The Expressionism of \"Caligari\" also influenced American avant-garde film, particularly those that used fantastic settings to illustrate an inhuman environment overpowering an individual. Early examples include \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" (1928), \"The Last Moment\" (1928) and \"\" (1928). LoBrutto wrote, \"Few films throughout motion picture history have had more influence on the avant-garde, art, and student cinema than \"Caligari\"\".\n\n\"Caligari\" and German Expressionism heavily influenced the American film noir period of the 1940s and 50s, both in visual style and narrative tone. Noir films tended to portray everyone, even the innocent, as the object of suspicion, a common thread in \"Caligari\". The genre also employs several Expressionistic elements in its dark and shadowy visual style, stylized and abstract photography, and distorted and expressive make-up and acting. \"Caligari\" also influenced films produced in the Soviet Union, such as \"Aelita\" (1924), and \"The Overcoat\". Observers have noted the black and white films of Ingmar Bergman bear a resemblance to the German films of the 1920s, and film historian Roy Armes has called him \"the true heir of Caligari\". Bergman himself, however, has downplayed the influence of German Expressionism on his work. \"Caligari\" has also affected stage theatre. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the film's use of the iris-in has been mimicked in theatrical productions, with lighting used to single out a lone actor.\n\n\"Caligari\" continues to be one of the most discussed and debated films from the Weimar Republic. Two major books have played a large part in shaping the perception of the film and its effect on cinema as a whole: Siegfried Kracauer's \"From Caligari to Hitler\" (1947) and Lotte Eisner's \"The Haunted Screen\" (1974). \"From Caligari to Hitler\" based its claims about the film largely on an unpublished typescript by Hans Janowitz called \"Caligari: The Story of a Famous Story\", which gave Janowitz and Carl Mayer principal credit for the making of \"Caligari\". Mike Budd wrote of Kracauer's book: \"Perhaps no film or period has been so thoroughly understood through a particular interpretation as has \"Caligari\", and Weimar cinema generally, through Kracauer's social-psychological approach\". Prior to the publication of \"From Caligari to Hitler\", few critics had derived any symbolic political meaning from the film, but Kracauer’s argument that it symbolized German obedience toward authority and a premonition of the rise of Adolf Hitler (see the Themes section for more) drastically changed attitudes about \"Caligari\". Many of his interpretations of the film are still embraced, even by those who have strongly disagreed with his general premise, and even as certain claims Kracauer made have been disproven, such as his statement that the original script included no frame story. (See Writing for more.) Eisner's book placed \"Caligari\" into historical context by identifying how it influenced Expressionist features in other films of the 1920s.\n\nFilm historian David Robinson claimed Wiene, despite being the director of \"Caligari\", is often given the least amount of credit for its production. He believes this is in part because Wiene died in 1938, closer to the release of the film than any other major collaborators, and was therefore unable to defend his involvement in the work while others took credit. In fact, Robinson argues \"Caligari\" ultimately hurt Wiene's reputation because his subsequent films did not match its success, so he is often wrongly considered \"a one-film director who had a lucky fluke with Caligari\".\n\n\"Caligari\", like a number of Weimar films that followed it, thematizes brutal and irrational authority by making a violent and possibly insane authority figure its antagonist. Kracauer said Dr. Caligari was symbolic of the German war government and fatal tendencies inherent in the German system, saying the character \"stands for an unlimited authority that idolizes power as such, and, to satisfy its lust for domination, ruthlessly violates all human rights and values\". Likewise, John D. Barlow described Dr. Caligari as an example of the tyrannical power and authority that had long plagued Germany, while Cesare represents the \"common man of unconditional obedience\". Janowitz has claimed Cesare represents the common citizen who is conditioned to kill or be killed, just as soldiers are trained during their military service, and that Dr. Caligari is symbolic of the German government sending those soldiers off to die in the war. The control Dr. Caligari yields over the minds and actions of others results in chaos and both moral and social perversion. Cesare lacks any individuality and is simply a tool of his master; Barlow writes that he is so dependent on Caligari that he falls dead when he strays too far from the source of his sustenance, \"like a machine that has run out of fuel\".\n\nIn his influential book \"From Caligari to Hitler\", Kracauer argues the Dr. Caligari character is symptomatic of a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, which he calls the German \"collective soul\". Kracauer argues Dr. Caligari and Cesare are premonitions of Adolf Hitler and his rule over Germany, and that his control over the weak-willed, puppet-like somnambulist prefigures aspects of the mentality that allowed the Nazi Party to rise. He calls Dr. Caligari's use of hypnotism to impose his will foreshadowing of Hitler's \"manipulation of the soul\". Kracauer described the film as an example of Germany's obedience to authority and failure or unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority, and reflects a \"general retreat\" into a shell that occurred in post-war Germany. Cesare symbolizes those who have no mind of their own and must follow the paths of others; Kracauer wrote he foreshadows a German future in which \"self-appointed Caligaris hypnotized innumerable Cesares into murder\". Barlow rejects Kracauer's claims that the film glorifies authority \"just because it has not made a preachy statement against it\", and said the connection between Dr. Caligari and Hitler lies in the mood the film conveys, not an endorsement of such tyrant on the film's part.\n\nEveryday reality in \"Caligari\" is dominated by tyrannical aspects. Authorities sit atop high perches above the people they deal with and hold offices out of sight at the end of long, forbidding stairways. Most of the film's characters are caricatures who fit neatly into prescribed social roles, such as the outraged citizens chasing a public enemy, the authoritarian police who are deferential to their superiors, the oft-harassed bureaucratic town clerk, and the asylum attendants who act like stereotypical \"little men in white suits\". Only Dr. Caligari and Cesare are atypical of social roles, instead serving as, in Barlow's words, \"abstractions of social fears, the incarnations of demonic forces of a nightmarish world the bourgeoisie was afraid to acknowledge, where self-assertion is pushed to willful and arbitrary power over others\". Kracauer wrote the film demonstrates a contrast between the rigid control, represented by such characters as Dr. Caligari and the town clerk, and chaos, represented by the crowds of people at the fair and the seemingly never-ending spinning of the merry-go-rounds. He said the film leaves no room for middle ground between these two extremes, and that viewers are forced to embrace either insanity or authoritarian rigidity, leaving little space for human freedom. Kracauer writes: \"\"Caligari\" exposes the soul wavering between tyranny and chaos, and facing a desperate situation: any escape from tyranny seems to throw it into a state of utter confusion\".\n\nDr. Caligari is not the only symbol of arrogant authority in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare can be seen as a rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.\n\nFrancis expresses a resentment of all forms of authority, particularly during the end of the frame story, when he feels he has been institutionalized because of the madness of the authorities, not because there is anything wrong with him. Francis can be seen, at least within the main narrative, as a symbol of reason and enlightenment triumphing over the irrational tyrant and unmasking the absurdity of social authority. But Kracauer contended the frame story undermines that premise. He argues if not for the frame story, the tale of Francis's efforts against Dr. Caligari would have been a praiseworthy example of independence and rebellion against authority. However, with the addition of the frame story, which places the veracity of Francis's claims into question, Kracauer argues the film glorifies authority and turns a reactionary story into an authoritarian film: \"The result of these modifications was to falsify the action and to ultimately reduce it to the ravings of a madman.\" Kracauer believed these changes were not necessarily intentional, but rather an \"instinctive submission to the necessities of the screen\" because commercial films had to \"answer to mass desires\". Fritz Lang disagreed with Kracaucer's argument, and instead believes the frame story makes the film's revolutionary inclinations more convincing, not less. David Robinson said, as time passed, filmgoers have been less inclined to interpret the film as a vindication of authority because modern audiences have grown more skeptical of authority in general, and are more inclined to believe Francis's story and interpret the asylum director as wrongly committing Francis to silence him.\n\nAnother major theme of \"Caligari\" is, as Stephen Brockmann writes, \"the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity, and hence the destabilization of the very notion of sanity itself\". By the end of the film, viewers realize the story they have been watching has been told from the perspective of an insane narrator, and therefore they cannot accept anything they have seen as reliable truth. The film's unusual visual abstractions and other stylized elements serve to show the world as one experienced by a madman. Similarly, the film has been described as portraying the story as a nightmare and the frame story as the real world. John D. Barlow said the film exemplifies a common Expressionist theme that \"the ultimate perception of reality will appear distorted and insane to the healthy and practical mind\". The film serves as a reminder that any story told through a flashback subjectivizes the story from the perspective of the narrator. At the end of the film, the asylum director gives no indication that he means Francis ill will, and in fact he seems to truly care for his patients. But Francis nevertheless believes he is being persecuted, so in the story as told from his perspective, Dr. Caligari takes on the role of persecutor.\n\nHowever, the Expressionistic visual elements of the film are present not only in the main narrative, but also in the epilogue and prologue scenes of the frame story, which are supposed to be an objective account of reality. For example, the frame story scenes still have trees with tentacle-like branches and a high, foreboding wall in the background. Strange leaf and line patterns are seen on the bench Francis sits upon, flame-like geometric designs can be seen on the walls, and his asylum cell has the same distorted shape as in the main narrative. If the primary story were strictly the delusions of a madman, the frame story would be completely devoid of those elements, but the fact they are present makes it unclear whether that perspective can be taken as reliable either. Instead, the film offers no true normal world to oppose to that of the twisted and nightmarish world as described by Francis. As a result, after the film's closing scene, it can be seen as ambiguous whether Francis or the asylum director is truly the insane one, or whether both are insane. Likewise, the final shot of the film, with an iris that fades to a close-up on the asylum director's face, further creates doubt over whether the character is actually sane and trustworthy. As Brockmann writes, \"In the end, the film is not just about one unfortunate madman; it is about an entire world that is possibly out of balance\". Mike Budd notes that, during the scene in which asylum doctors restrain Francis, his movements closely mimic those of Dr. Caligari from a similar scene during the main story. Budd says this suggests a \"dream logic of repetition\" that throws further confusion on which perspective is reality.\n\nDuality is another common theme in \"Caligari\". Dr. Caligari is portrayed in the main narrative as an insane tyrant, and in the frame story as a respected authority and director of a mental institution. As a result of this duality, the viewer cannot help but suspect a malevolent aspect of him at the conclusion of the film, even despite all evidence indicating he is a kind and caring man. Even within the main narrative alone, Dr. Caligari lives a double life: holding a respectable position as the asylum director, but becoming a hypnotist and murderer at night. Additionally, the character is actually a double of the \"real\" Caligari, an 18th-century mystic whom the film character becomes so obsessed with that he desires to penetrate his innermost secrets and \"become Caligari\". Francis also takes on a double life of sorts, serving as the heroic protagonist in the main narrative and a patient in a mental institution in the frame story. Anton Kaes described the story Francis tells as an act of transference with his psychiatrist, as well as a projection of his feelings that he is a victim under the spell of the all-powerful asylum director, just as Cesare is the hypnotized victim of Dr. Caligari. The Cesare character serves as both a persecutor and a victim, as he is both a murderer and the unwilling slave of an oppressive master.\n\nSiegfried Kracauer said by coupling a fantasy in which Francis overthrows a tyrannical authority, with a reality in which authority triumphs over Francis, \"Caligari\" reflects a double aspect of German life, suggesting they reconsider their traditional belief in authority even as they embrace it. A contrast between levels of reality exists not only in the characterizations, but in the presentation of some of the scenes as well. This, as Barlow writes, \"reveals a contrast between external calm and internal chaos\". For example, flashback scenes when Francis reads Dr. Caligari's diary, in which the doctor is shown growing obsessed with learning hypnotic powers, take place as Dr. Caligari is sleeping peacefully in the present. Another example is the fair, which on the surface appears to represent fun and escapism, but reveals a lurking sense of chaos and disaster in the form of Dr. Caligari and Cesare. The visual elements of the film also convey a sense of duality, particularly in the contrasts between black and white. This is particularly prevalent in the sets, where black shadows are set against white walls, but also in other elements like the costumes and make-up. For instance, Dr. Caligari wears mostly black, but white streaks are present in his hair and on his gloves. Cesare's face is a ghostly white, but the darks of his eyes are heavily outlined in black. Likewise, Jane's white face contrasts with her deep, dark eyes.\n\nCritics have suggested that \"Caligari\" highlights some of the neuroses prevalent in Germany and the Weimar Republic when the film was made, particularly in the shadow of World War I, at a time when extremism was rampant, reactionaries still controlled German institutions, and citizens feared the harm the Treaty of Versailles would have on the economy. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the paranoia and fear portrayed in the film were signs of things to come in Germany, and that the film reflected a tendency in Germans to \"retreat into themselves\" and away from political engagement following the war. Vincent LoBrutto wrote that the film can be seen as a social or political analogy of \"the moral and physical breakdown of Germany at the time, with a madman on the loose wreaking havoc on a distorted and off-balanced society, a metaphor for a country in chaos\".\n\nAnton Kaes, who called \"Caligari\" \"an aggressive statement about war psychiatry, murder and deception\", wrote that Alan's question to Cesare, \"How long have I to live?\" reflected the trauma German citizens experienced during the war, as that question was often on the minds of soldiers and of family members back home concerned about their loved ones in the military. Francis's despair after Alan's murder can likewise be compared to that of the many soldiers who survived the war but saw their friends die on the battlefield. Kaes noted other parallels between the film and war experiences, noting that Cesare attacked Alan at dawn, a common time for attacks during the war. Thomas Elsaesser called Caligari an \"outstanding example of how \"fantastic\" representations in German films from the early 1920s seem to bear the imprint of pressures from external events, to which they refer only through the violence with which they disguise and disfigure them.\"\n\nSeveral unsuccessful attempts were made to produce sequels and remakes in the decades following \"Caligari\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release. Robert Wiene bought the rights to \"Caligari\" from Universum Film AG in 1934 with the intention of filming a sound remake, which never materialized before Wiene's death in 1938. He intended to cast Jean Cocteau as Cesare, and a script, believed to be written by Wiene, indicated the Expressionist style would have been replaced with a French surrealist style.\n\nIn 1944, Erich Pommer and Hans Janowitz each separately attempted to obtain the legal rights to the film, with hopes of a Hollywood remake. Pommer attempted to argue he had a better claim to the rights because the primary value of the original film came not from the writing, but \"in the revolutionary way the picture was produced\". However, both Janowitz and Pommer ran into complications related to the invalidity of Nazi law in the United States, and uncertainty over the legal rights of sound and silent films. Janowitz wrote a treatment for a remake, and in January 1945 was offered a minimum guarantee of $16,000 against a five-percent royalty for his rights to the original film for a sequel to be directed by Fritz Lang, but the project never came to fruition. Later, Janowitz planned a sequel called \"Caligari II\", and unsuccessfully attempted to sell the property to a Hollywood producer for $30,000.\n\nAround 1947, Hollywood agent Paul Kohner and German filmmaker Ernst Matray also planned a \"Caligari\" sequel; Matray and his wife Maria Solveg wrote a screenplay called \"The Return of Caligari\". That script would have reimagined Dr. Caligari as a former Nazi officer and war criminal, but the film was never produced.\n\nIn 1960, independent Hollywood producer Robert Lippert acquired the rights to \"Caligari\" from Matray and Universum Film AG for $50,000, and produced a film called \"The Cabinet of Caligari\", which was released in 1962. Screenwriter Robert Bloch did not intend to write a \"Caligari\" remake, and in fact the title was forced upon his untitled screenplay by director Roger Kay. The film had few similarities to the original \"Caligari\" except for its title and a plot twist at the end, in which it is revealed the story was simply the delusion of the protagonist, who believed she was being held captive by a character named Caligari. Instead, he was her psychiatrist, and he cures her at the end of the film.\n\nA quasi-sequel, called \"Dr. Caligari\", was released in 1989, directed by Stephen Sayadian and starring Madeleine Reynal as the granddaughter of the original Dr. Caligari, now running an asylum and performing bizarre hormonal experiments on its patients. The sex-driven story ultimately had little in common with the original film.\n\nIn 1992, theatre director Peter Sellars released his only feature film, \"The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez\", an experimental film loosely based on \"Caligari\". However, the storyline was created as the film was being made, so it has few similarities with the original film. The film was screened only at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival and never theatrically released.\n\nIn 1999 Joseph Kahn and Rob Zombie directed a music video for the single \"Living Dead Girl\" with imagery directly inspired by \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\".\n\nAn independent film remake of \"Caligari\" edited, written and directed by David Lee Fisher was released in 2005, in which new actors were placed in front of the actual backdrops from the original film. The actors performed in front of a green screen, then their performances were superimposed in front of matte shots based on the original sets. Doug Jones played the role of Cesare.\n\nIn 2014 the movie was released in a 4K resolution restoration. The premiere of this version in the Netherlands was in April 2016 during the Imagine Film Festival accompanied with a live soundtrack, composed and performed by the Dutch psychedelic band Monomyth.\n\nIn 1981, Bill Nelson was asked by the Yorkshire Actors Company to create a soundtrack for a stage adaptation of the film. That music was later recorded for his 1982 album \"Das Kabinet (The Cabinet Of Doctor Caligari)\".\n\n\"Caligari\" was adapted into an opera in 1997 by composer John Moran. It premiered at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a production by Robert McGrath.\n\nNumerous musicians have composed new scores to accompany the film. The Club Foot Orchestra premiered a score penned by ensemble founder and artistic director Richard Marriott in 1987. In 2000, the Israeli Electronica group TaaPet made several live performances of their soundtrack for the film around Israel. Bertelsmann/BMG commissioned Timothy Brock to adapt his 1996 score for string orchestra for the 2014 restoration; Brock conducted the premiere in Brussels on 15 September 2014. In 2012, the Chatterbox Audio Theatre recorded a live soundtrack, including dialogue, sound effects and music for \"Caligari\", which was released on YouTube on 30 October 2013.\n\nDeepan Sivaraman, noted scenographer and director from India, adapted the film into an hour-long mixed-media piece with the Performance Studies students at Ambedkar University Delhi as part of a course entitled \"Space and Spectatorship.\" The performance took place in a run-down warehouse on the university campus and employed multimedia projection to create visual impact. The show premiered in February 2015 in Delhi.\n\n2016 saw the production of another operatic version of Dr. Caligari composed by Karen MacIver for Scottish Opera's Connect Company with a libretto provided by Allan Dunn. This opera has the action set in Glasgow 1898. The first performances under the direction of Julie Brown took place on the 9th and 10 April 2016 in Glasgow's Woodside Halls featured the Scottish Opera Connect Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Chris Gray. Alumni from Scottish Opera's Emerging Artists Programme - Andrew McTaggart (Baritone) and Sarah Power (Soprano) - were cast as Dr. Caligari/Dr. Gallacher and Jane respectively alongside Daniel Keating Roberts (Counter-tenor) as Cesare and Glen Cunningham (Tenor) as Francis with members of the Chorus providing additional roles.\n\n2016 saw also the publishing of a DVD by Cineteca di Bologna with 2 new soundtracks by Edison Studio (in surround sound 5.1) and Timothy Brock (for Brussels Philarmonic Orchestra) on a new restored version of Caligari movie. The first live performance of the soundtrack by Edison Studio had taken place at the 2003 International Computer Music Conference, Singapore on 2 October 2003.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1994, a 3-issue comic book mini-series entitled \"Caligari 2050\" written by Rafael Nieves and illustrated by Ken Holewczynski was published by Caliber Entertainment. In this futuristic take on the classic film, a mysterious somnambulist killer named Caesar is stalking and killing one by one the corrupt members of a power cabal in New City, a so-called \"perfect\" city of the future, who have created population mind control. This mini-series was later released complete in graphic-novel format as \"Caligari 2050: Another Sleepless Night\".\n\nIn 1998, an audio adaptation of the film written and directed by Yuri Rasovsky was released by Dove Audio on audio cassette. With a cast including John de Lancie as \"Franz\"/\"Francis\", Tony Jay as Caligari, Kaitlin Hopkins as \"Anna\"/\"Jane\" and Robertson Dean as \"Karl\"/\"Alan\", this dramatization won the Independent Publishers Award for Best Direct-to-Audio Production in 1998. An audio CD of this production was released by Blackstone Audio in 2013.\n\nIn 2008, BBC Radio 3 broadcast an audio adaptation by Amanda Dalton entitled \"Caligari\", starring Tom Ferguson as \"Franzis\", Luke Treadaway as \"Allan\", Sarah McDonald Hughes as \"Jane\", countertenor Robin Blaze as \"Cesare\" and Terence Mann as \"The Town Clerk\" (doubling as the voice of \"The Director\" of the mental asylum, Caligari being an entirely silent character in this production).\n\nIn 2015 Delhi-based theatre director and scenographer Deepan Sivaraman directed a play inspired by the film by the same name. The play has been performed by Performance Studies Collective group from Delhi and is a contemporary take on the 1920 film, emerging out of spatial experimentation with a focus on objects, some found and others made. The play was later premiered at the Bhrat Rang Mahotsav in 2016 and later went on to win the META Award in the same year. South Indian premiere was in 2017 at the International Theater Festival of Kerala. It is a multimedia performance in which the scenography and dramaturgy emerge together in an attempt to navigate through the run-down warehouse space where the production has been staged.\n\n\n\n"}

Nevertheless, Its stage was cramped, with very little room in the wings, and the orchestra pit could not seat more than 30 musicians.\nAt the eve of the French Revolution, as waves of political unrest rocked Geneva, the new theatre's function was still to entertain foreign officers sent as reinforcements and seats were primarily reserved for sponsors and shareholders. As such, most of the Geneva population could not attend performances.\n\nThe Théâtre de Neuve was destined to stand in place for less than a hundred years. Revolutionary troubles forced the theatre to close several times and it was used consecutively as a revolutionary club and a cotton mill. In October 1797, the theatre was definitely closed to any kind of performance, by decision of the authorities.\n\nIt remained closed until the French annexed Geneva in April 1798. During this fifteen-year occupation, the theatre hosted several companies of French performers. When Geneva's independence was restored in 1813, the French troops left Geneva, and the actors followed them. The theatre reopened in 1817 and expanded its audiences and repertoire, including works by contemporary composers such as Rossini, Donizetti, Auber and Meyerbeer, Beethoven, Weber and even Wagner, whose \"Tannhäuser\" was heard in Geneva long before it was ever performed in Paris. Despite occasional performances by stars of the time, the quality of performance was usually below average, a mix of comedy, vaudeville, operetta and, occasionally, a more ambitious opera. The general trend was partial to the French repertoire, preferably light: \"Faust\" was a regular hit, but nowhere near \"La fille de Madame Angot\" in popularity.\n"}
{"id": "25822898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25822898", "title": "Tò he", "text": "Tò he\n\nTò he (\"toy figurine\") is a traditional toy for children in Vietnam which is made from glutinous rice powder in form of edible figurine such as animals, flowers or characters in folk stories. In the past, \"tò he\" was made and sold only on the occasion of festivals, especially the Tết and the Trung Thu which are the favorite festivals of Vietnamese children. Nowadays, the toy is introduced in almost all traditional festivals and in public places like parks or gardens. As tò he is one of the rare surviving traditional toys of Vietnam, the art of tò he making is considered a cultural ambassador of Vietnam and there are many efforts in order to preserve and develop this traditional art.\n\nTo create a \"tò he\" figurine, the craftsman needs a mixture of glutinous and ordinary rice powders which is easily to knead into different shapes and edible for children, bamboo sticks to plant the shaped tò he and his own skill in graphic depicting. Modeled by the hand of the craftsmen, the forms of tò he figurine are drawn from animals, flowers and characters in folk stories such as Tôn Ngộ Không, the Monkey King in \"Journey to the West\". There are seven basic colours of tò he figurines which are green, sea blue, red, purple, yellow, white and black, those colours come from rice powder mixed with food dyes which are used to replace colours from trees or ashes in order to ensure the edibleness of tò he. In the past, tò he was steamed after being kneaded but today the figurines are made directly from preboiled paste so that the craftsman can reduce the time for making one tò he figurine. The paste is made from glutinous and ordinary rice powders, it was kneaded with fresh water before dropped in boiling water for one hour and finally dyed with food colour.\n\nThe procedure of tò he making requires utmost patience from the craftsman, but almost all tò he makers are men and there is an unwritten law in families of tò he craftsmen that secret in making tò he is only passed from father to sons and daughters-in-law, not to daughters. There are no lesson of tò he making, sons are transmitted the skill from their father solely in watching and self-learning. Nevertheless, nowadays tò he making is also taught to the handicapped so that they can live on making tò he and other forms of traditional art.\n\nTraditionally, tò he craftsmen had a compact set of tools so that in one day they could go to several common places such as markets, communal temple grounds and especially local festivals where children often gathered to play or accompany their parents. According to the old generation of tò he craftsmen, the origin of tò he making was dated to the 17th century. The two most important occasions each year for tò he craftsmen are Tết and Trung Thu because they are the favorite festivals for Vietnamnese children.\n\nNowadays, tò he is made and sold not only during the Tết holiday and other festivals but also all year round in public place like parks, gardens. The price for a figurine sold in Hanoi varies from 3,000 to 5,000 VND. There is a village in the countryside of Hanoi where many people earn their living by making and selling tò he, it is Xuân La village which has about 200 tò he craftsmen and almost all villagers from children to adults can make tò he figurine in a very brief period. Facing the threat from modern toys and other forms of entertainment, tò he craftsmen have to be more and more creative so that their figurines can appear more lively and closer to the children, for that reason tò he figurines today can be also modeled after characters from international films and cartoons such as Doraemon, Pikachu and even Sailor Moon with her very own blond hair.\nAs one of the rare surviving traditional toys in modern time, tò he is considered a cultural ambassador of Vietnam. Some craftsmen are invited to the United States or South Korea to perform the art of tò he making. Another positive sign for the existence of tò he is that the Ministry of Culture and Information of Vietnam has paid more attention in preserving and propagating this traditional art. A tò he craftsman from Thái Bình was presented with medal from the Vietnam Folk Literature and Art Association for his effort in preserving the art of tò he making while tò he is frequently introduced in cultural festivals. Tò he is brought to the poor children of the mountainous region in the North of Vietnam who cannot afford to buy toys, they are also given instructions to make simple forms of tò he figurines.\n\n"}
