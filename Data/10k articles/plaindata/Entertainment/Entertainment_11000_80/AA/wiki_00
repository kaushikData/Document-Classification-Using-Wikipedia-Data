{"id": "5644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5644", "title": "Comedy film", "text": "Comedy film\n\nComedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humour. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.\n\nComedy, compared with other film genres, puts much more focus on individual stars, with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity. While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse, others contain political or social commentary (such as \"The King of Comedy\" and \"Wag the Dog\").\n\nA comedy of manners satirizes the manners and affectations of a social class, often represented by stock characters. Also, satirical comedy-drama & the plot is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other scandal. However, the plot is generally less important for its comedic effect than its witty dialogue. This form of comedy has a long ancestry, dating back at least as far as \"Much Ado about Nothing\" created by William Shakespeare.\n\nSlapstick films involve exaggerated, boisterous action to create impossible and humorous situations. Because it relies predominately on visual depictions of events, it does not require sound. Accordingly, the subgenre was ideal for silent movies and was prevalent during that era. Popular silent stars of the slapstick genre include Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Roscoe Arbuckle, and Harold Lloyd. Some of these stars, as well as acts such as Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges, also found success incorporating slapstick comedy into sound films.\n\nIn a fish out of water comedy, the main character or character finds himself in an unusual environment, which drives most of the humour. Situations can be neo noir crime comedy, satirical comedy-drama & black comedy as sometimes as fantasy comedy behinds swapping gender roles, as in \"Tootsie\" (1982); an age changing role, as in \"Big\" (1988); a freedom-loving individual fitting into a structured environment, as in \"Police Academy\" (1984); a rural backwoodsman in the big city, as in \"Crocodile Dundee\", and so forth. The Coen Brothers are known for using this technique in all of their films, though not always to comic effect. Some films including people fitting the \"fish-out-of-water\" bill include \"The Big Lebowski\" (1998) and \"A Serious Man\" (2009).\n\nA parody or spoof film is a comedy that satirizes other film genres or classic films. Such films mockumentary, employ sarcasm, stereotyping, mockery of scenes from other films, and the obviousness of meaning in a character's actions. Examples of this form include \"Mud and Sand\" (1922), \"Blazing Saddles\" (1974), \"Airplane!\" (1980), \"Young Frankenstein\" (1974),and \"Scary Movie (2000).\n\nThe anarchic comedy film, as its name suggests, is a random or stream-of-consciousness type of humour which often lampoons a form of authority. The genre dates from the silent era, and the most famous examples of this type of film would be those produced by Monty Python. Others include \"Duck Soup\" (1933) and \"National Lampoon's Animal House\" (1978).\n\nThe black comedy film deals with normally taboo subjects, including death, murder, crime, suicide, and war, in a satirical manner. Examples include \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" (1944), \"Monsieur Verdoux\" (1947), \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" (1949), \"The Ladykillers\" (1955), \"\" (1964), \"The Loved One\" (1965), \"MASH\" (1970), \"The King of Comedy\" (1983), \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\" (1983), \"Brazil\" (1985), \"After Hours\" (1985), \"The War of the Roses\" (1989), \"Heathers\" (1989), \"Your Friends & Neighbors\" (1998), \"Keeping Mum\" (2005), \"Burn After Reading\" (2008), \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013) and \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri\" (2017).\n\nGross out films are a relatively recent development and rely heavily on vulgar, sexual or \"toilet\" humour. Examples include \"Porky's\" (1982), \"Dumb and Dumber\" (1994), \"There's Something About Mary\" (1998), and \"American Pie\" (1999).\n\nIt was not uncommon for the early romantic comedy film to also be a screwball comedy film. This form of comedy film was particularly popular during the 1930s and 1940s. There is no consensus definition of this film style, and it is often loosely applied to slapstick or romantic comedy films. Typically it can include a romantic element, an interplay between people of different economic strata, quick and witty repartee, some form of role reversal, and a happy ending. Some examples of the screwball comedy are: \"It Happened One Night\" (1934), \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938), \"Philadelphia Story\" (1940), \"His Girl Friday\" (1940), and more recently, \"What's Up, Doc?\" (1972).\n\nFilms in this sub-genre blend comic antics and action where the film stars combine with and one-liners with a thrilling plot and daring stunts. The genre became a specific draw in North America in the eighties when comedians such as Eddie Murphy started taking more action oriented roles such as in \"48 Hrs.\" and \"Beverly Hills Cop\". These types of films are often buddy films, with mismatched partners such as in \"Midnight Run\", \"Rush Hour\", \"21 Jump Street\", \"Bad Boys\", \"Starsky and Hutch\", and \"Hot Fuzz\". Slapstick martial arts films became a mainstay of Hong Kong action cinema through the work of Jackie Chan among others. It may also focus on superheroes such as \"The Incredibles\", \"Hancock\", \"Kick-Ass\", and \"Mystery Men\". It may focus on kung fu such as \"Kung Fu Panda\".\n\nComedy horror is a type of film in which the usual dark themes and \"scare tactics\" attributed to horror films are treated with a humorous approach. These films either use goofy horror cliches, such as in \"Scream\", \"Young Frankenstein\", \"Little Shop of Horrors\", \"Haunted Mansion\", and \"Scary Movie\" where campy styles are favoured. Some are much more subtle and don't parody horror, such as \"An American Werewolf In London\". Another style of comedy horror can also rely on over the top violence and gore such as in \"The Evil Dead\" (1981), \"Re-Animator\" (1985), \"Braindead\" (1992), and \"Club Dread\" (2004) - such films are sometimes known as \"splatstick\", a portmanteau of the words \"splatter\" and \"slapstick\". It would be reasonable to put \"Ghostbusters\" in this category.\n\nA genre that combines elements of comedy and thrillers, a combination of humor and suspense or action. Films such as \"Silver Streak\", \"Charade\", \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\", \"In Bruges\", \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\", \"Grosse Point Blank\", \"The Thin Man\", \"The Big Fix\", and \"The Lady Vanishes\".\n\nFantasy comedy films are types of films that uses magic, supernatural and or mythological figures for comic purposes. Most fantasy comedy includes an element of parody, or satire, turning many of the fantasy conventions on their head such as the hero becoming a cowardly fool, the princess being a klutz. Examples of these films include \"The Chipmunk Adventure\", \"Big\", \"Being John Malkovich\", \"Ernest Saves Christmas\", \"Ernest Scared Stupid\", \"Night at the Museum\", \"Groundhog Day\", \"Click\", and \"Shrek\".\n\nSci-fi comedy films, like most hybrid genre of comedy, use the elements of science fiction films to over the top extremes and exaggerated science fiction stereotypical characters. Examples of these types of films include \"Back to the Future\", \"Spaceballs\", \"Ghostbusters\", \"Evolution\", \"Innerspace\", \"Galaxy Quest\", \"Mars Attacks!\", \"Men in Black\", and \"The World's End\".\n\nMilitary comedy films involve comic situations in a military setting. When a film is primarily about the experience of civilians called into military service and still feeling out of place, it may be referred to as a \"service comedy\". Because war is such a grim subject, many military comedies are set in peacetime or during wartime but away from battle zones. Military and service comedies include:\nThe romantic comedy film subgenre typically involves the development of a relationship between a man and a woman. The stereotyped plot line follows the \"boy-gets-girl\", \"boy-loses-girl\", \"boy gets girl back again\" sequence. Naturally, there are innumerable variants to this plot, and much of the generally light-hearted comedy lies in the social interactions and sexual tensions between the pair. Examples of this style of film include \"It\" (1927), \"City Lights\" (1931), \"It's a Wonderful World\" (1939), \"The Shop Around the Corner\" (1940), \"Sabrina\" (1954), \"Annie Hall\" (1977), \"When Harry Met Sally...\" (1989), \"Pretty Woman\" (1990), \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" (1994), and \"There's Something About Mary\" (1998).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5811271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5811271", "title": "Gateball", "text": "Gateball\n\nGateball is played on a rectangular court long and wide. Each court has three gates and a goal pole. The game is played by two teams (red and white) of up to five players. Each player has a numbered ball corresponding to their playing order. The odd-numbered balls are red and the even-numbered balls are white. Teams score one point for each ball hit through a gate and two points for hitting the goal pole, in accordance with the rules. A game of gateball lasts for thirty minutes and the winner is the team with the most points at the end of the game.\n\nGateball was invented in Japan by Suzuki Kazunobu in 1947. At the time there was a severe shortage of rubber needed to make the balls used in many sports. Suzuki, then working in the lumber industry on the northern island of Hokkaido, realised there was a ready supply of the wood used to make croquet balls and mallets. He revised the rules of croquet and created gateball as a game for young people.\n\nGateball first became popular in the late 1950s when a physical education instructor introduced gateball to the women's societies and senior citizens’ clubs of Kumamoto City. In 1962, the Kumamoto Gateball Association was formed and established a local set of rules. This version of the game became known nationally when it was demonstrated at a national fitness meet in Kumamoto in 1976. Shortly afterwards the gateball's popularity exploded as local government officials and representatives of senior citizens’ organisations introduced the sport around the country.\n\nIn 1984, the Japanese Gateball Union (JGU) was founded. Under the leadership of its inaugural chairman, Ryoichi Sasakawa, the JGU developed a unified set of rules and organised the first national meet. The following year, the JGU joined with five countries and regions, China, Korea, Brazil, United States of America and Chinese Taipei, to form the World Gateball Union (WGU). The WGU has since been joined by Bolivia (1987), Paraguay (1987), Peru (1987), Argentina (1989), Canada (1989), Singapore (1994), Hong Kong (1998), Australia (2003), Macao (2005), Philippines (2012) and Indonesia (2013). \n\nGateball is played between two teams of up to five people on a rectangular field 15-20 meters long and 20-25 wide. The two teams use five balls each, either red or white depending on the team, and play in an alternating fashion between red and white the balls numbered from 1 to 10. Each player plays the same ball throughout the game. At the beginning of the game the players, in order, place their ball in the designated “start area” and attempt to hit the ball through the first gate. If they successfully pass through the gate they may play again. If the player misses the first gate, or their ball passes through the first gate but ends up outside of the court, they pick up their ball and have to try again in the second round.(Since the 2015 rule changes, a ball going through the first gate but ending up out of bounds is deemed to have passed Gate1 but is an outball and will attempt to enter court on their next turn from the place the ball went outball).\n\nWhen stroking, if the ball hits another ball, this is called a \"touch\". If both the stroker's ball and the touched ball remain within the inside line, the stroker shall step on the stroker's ball and place the other touched ball so that it is touching the stroker's ball, and hit the strokers ball with the stick (this play is called a “spark”), sending the other touched ball off as the result of the impact. By passing through a gate or sparking the ball, a player receives another turn.\n\nOne point is given for every gate the ball passes in order and two points for hitting the goal-pole. The winner is the team with the most points at the end of thirty minutes. As the red team always gets to play first, the white team always has the final turn, even if time has elapsed before the final white ball is called.\n\nIn 2001, gateball was included as an exhibition event at the 6th World Games. The competition was held in Akita Prefecture in Japan and was attended by teams from China, Japan, South Korea, the USA and Chinese Taipei. The final was won by a team of mostly teenage players from Japan.\n\nThe World Gateball Championships are held every four years. The inaugural championship in 1986 was played in Hokkaido with teams from Brazil, China, Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea and the United States of America. Subsequent championships were held in Hawaii (1998); Toyama, Japan (2002); Jeju, South Korea (2006); Shanghai, China( 2010); and Niigata (Japan) in 2014.\n\nThe 10th World Championship was played on 17-19 September 2010 in Shanghai China. The competition was contested by 96 teams from 14 countries/regions including Australia, Brazil, China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Paraguay, the Philippines, South Korea, Russia and the USA.\n\nThe 12th World Championship was held in São Paulo In Brazil on September 21-23 in 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "1661983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1661983", "title": "Glen H. Taylor", "text": "Glen H. Taylor\n\nGlen Hearst Taylor (April 12, 1904 – April 28, 1984) was an American politician, entertainer, businessman, and United States Senator from Idaho.\n\nHe was the vice presidential candidate on the Progressive Party ticket in the 1948 election. Taylor was otherwise a member of the Democratic Party. By one measure Taylor was the second most liberal member of the U.S. Senate (trailing only Wayne Morse of Oregon), and the fourth most liberal member of Congress overall between 1937 and 2002.\n\nBorn in a boarding house in Portland, Oregon, Taylor was the twelfth of thirteen children of Pleasant John Taylor and Olive Higgins Taylor. His father was a retired Texas ranger and wandering preacher, and the family was with him in Portland for a protracted soul-saving meeting. The family homesteaded in north central Idaho near Kooskia, and Taylor attended the public schools. In 1919, after completing the eighth grade, he joined his older brother's stock theater company, and between 1926 and 1944, he became the owner and manager of various entertainment enterprises. Taylor was also a country-western singer; his older sister, Lena, became famous as a jazz singer under the name Lee Morse in the 1920s.\n\nTaylor was inspired to run for political office by King Camp Gillette's book \"The People's Corporation\" and Stuart Chase's 1932 book \"A New Deal\". In 1935 Taylor unsuccessfully attempted to organize a Farmer–Labor Party in Nevada and Montana.\n\nBy the late 1930s, Taylor had settled in eastern Idaho at Pocatello. His first political campaign was in 1938 for an open seat in the U.S. House from the second district, but he finished a distant fourth in the Democratic primary.\n\nTaylor first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1940 in a special election to fill the remaining term of the late William Borah, but lost to appointee John W. Thomas, with 47.1 to 52.9 percent. Despite being labeled as \"semi-socialistic\" and \"communistic,\" he ran again in 1942 against Thomas and lost a closer race, 48.5 to 51.5 percent. Taylor lost both elections to Thomas because of stiff opposition from state Democratic Party leaders. Between elections Taylor supported himself as a painter's assistant and sheet metal worker in California.\n\nIn a third try for the U.S. Senate, Taylor ran for the other Idaho seat in 1944, defeating incumbent D. Worth Clark in the Democratic primary, and Governor C. A. Bottolfsen in the general election. Taylor, the first professional actor ever elected to the United States Congress, had never been east of Chicago prior to his election.\n\nIn the Senate, Taylor, known as \"The Singing Cowboy,\" acquired a reputation for eccentric behavior. Upon his arrival in Washington D.C., Taylor rode his horse, Nugget, up the steps of the U.S. Capitol building. Nugget also accompanied Taylor during a 1947 tour of the country highlighting his anti-war activism and opposition to the U.S. foreign policy of the time.\n\nWhen Taylor moved to Washington in preparation to be sworn in in January 1945, the housing shortage caused by World War II continued to be in full swing and he and his family had a difficult time finding a place to live. In response, Taylor a musician and songwriter stood outside the U.S. Capitol building and sang, \"O give us a home, near the Capitol dome, with a yard for two children to play ...\" to the tune of \"Home on the Range\". He and his family were offered several places to rent. Taylor was appointed to the Committee on Banking and Currency after telling Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York that he was qualified for the post because he had been a depositor with several banks. In October 1945, Taylor submitted a resolution to the Senate \"favoring the creation of a world republic.\"\n\nIn July 1946, at a convention of the National Lawyers Guild in Cleveland, Senator Taylor said: Success of monopolies in dealing with the present Congress is evident in the wrecking of price control, profit-guaranteeing tax rebates, blocking of power projects in the Columbia and Missouri Valleys, pigeonholing of the minimum wage bill and in the emasculation of the 1944 Kilgore Reconversion Bill and the 1945 Murray Full-Employment Bill. <br> Monopolies have so influenced our foreign policy that it serves monopoly and monopolistic aims. \n\nOn election night in 1946, Taylor made national headlines by allegedly breaking the jaw of local Republican leader Ray McKaig in a hotel lobby in Boise. Taylor claimed that McKaig had called him an obscene name, and struck him first with a punch that broke his nose, but McKaig denied those claims. McKaig, 66, claimed that while he was lying on the floor Taylor proceeded to kick him in the face, but Taylor denied that claim. Later, when Taylor lost his reelection bid in the 1950 primary, McKaig sent a telegram that said, \"You may have broken my jaw, but I just broke your back!!!\"\n\nTaylor also feuded with other Idaho Democrats, often making critical remarks about Charles Gossett, who resigned as governor in November 1945 to have his successor appoint him to the vacant U.S. Senate seat. During the 1946 Democratic primary in June, Taylor openly supported Gossett's opponent, George Donart, calling the appointed incumbent Gossett a \"conservative\" who \"hobnobbed\" with Republicans in Congress.\n\nIn the Senate, Taylor became noted for lengthy speeches which were often critical of President Harry S. Truman's policies, particularly in foreign affairs. He was particularly critical of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, both of which he believed brought the United States closer to war with the Soviet Union. Taylor was decidedly less critical of the Soviet Union than most of his Senate colleagues, once noting that there was no need to criticize Soviet policy when there were 90 other Senators willing to do it every day.\n\nTaylor was an early proponent of the civil rights movement and as a United States Senator openly opposed segregationist policies and supporters. In January 1947 Taylor requested that the Senate delay the swearing in of Mississippi Sen. Theodore G. Bilbo, who had been reelected in 1946, pending investigation of charges against Bilbo for corruption and civil rights violations. As a result, Bilbo – well known for his segregationist, racially charged rhetoric – was never formally seated for his final Senate term. The impasse was not completely resolved until Bilbo's death in August 1947.\n\nTaylor was arrested on May 1, 1948, in Birmingham, Alabama, by police commissioner Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, for attempting to use a door reserved for African Americans, rather than the whites-only door, while attempting to attend a meeting of the Southern Negro Youth Congress. He was subsequently convicted of disorderly conduct.\n\nIn July 1947, Taylor was asked by a United Press reporter what he thought about reports that remnants of a UFO had been found by the Air Force near Roswell, New Mexico. Taylor replied that he almost hoped flying saucers would turn out to be spaceships from another planet. \"They could end our petty arguments on earth.\" He went on to say that no matter what the UFOs turned out to be, they \"can't be laughed off.\"\n\n\"Even if it is only a psychological phenomenon, it is a sign of what the world is coming to,\" Taylor explained. \"If we don't ease the tensions, the whole world will be full of psychological cases and eventually turn into a global nuthouse.\"\n\nIn 1948 Taylor was chosen as the vice presidential candidate on the Progressive ticket headed by former Vice President Henry A. Wallace of Iowa. The unabashedly leftist Wallace/Taylor ticket failed to carry any states and won only 2.4 percent of the nationwide popular vote. The nomination prompted an effort by conservatives within the Idaho Democratic Party to expel him from its ranks, but was defeated.\n\nIn 1950, former Senator David Worth Clark sought to regain his Senate seat from Taylor. Taylor's run on the Progressive ticket earned him a reputation as an \"incorrigible leftist\" in Idaho and contributed to his defeat in his reelection campaign in 1950. Taylor was defeated in the Democratic primary by Clark, who in turn lost in the general election to conservative Republican Herman Welker.\n\n\nTaylor served as president of Coryell Construction Company from 1950 to 1952, but was forced to resign after being labeled a \"security risk,\" jeopardizing a government contract. Afterwards he was often forced to work manual labor construction jobs. He ran again for the Senate in 1954 but was decisively beaten by Republican incumbent Henry Dworshak, winning only 37.2 percent of the vote. His sixth and final Senate attempt came in 1956; he narrowly lost the Democratic primary to 32-year-old lawyer Frank Church, and then got 5.1 percent of the vote in the general election as a write-in candidate. In March 1958, Taylor proposed that Church take a lie detector test about fraud in the 1956 primary.\n\nIn 1958, Taylor and his wife Dora moved to Millbrae, California, and began making hairpieces by hand based on a hairpiece Taylor made for himself in the early 1940s. By 1960 Taylor Topper Inc. had become the major manufacturer of hair replacements in the United States. Taylor told the \"Washington Post\" in 1978 that it was something he was very familiar with. \"I was 18, a juvenile leading man in a traveling show, and my hair had begun to fall out. There isn't much demand for bald juvenile leading men, and I tried everything – sheep dip, what have you – and that just made it fall out faster.\"\n\nTaylor explained that he had run for public office without the hairpiece and found that voters \"didn't have much use for bald politicians\", but \"I ran the fourth time with it and won.\" His original toupée was made from a tin pie plate, which he lined with pink felt and swatches of human hair. In 1958, he was granted a patent (#2,850,023) for his innovative product. Glen and Dora Taylor were successful manufacturing hair pieces, and Taylor Toppers became famous. The company, now known as Taylormade Hair Replacement, is still active in Millbrae.\n\nGlen and Dora Taylor had three sons between 1935 and 1942, Glen Arod – Dora spelled backward, followed by Paul Jon and Greg.\n\nTaylor died at age 80 in April 1984 due to complications from Alzheimer's disease; Dora Taylor remained in the San Mateo County area until her death at age 93 in 1997. They are interred at Skylawn Memorial Park in San Mateo.\n\nSenator Glen H. Taylor, \"The Way It Was With Me\" (memoir), Lyle Stuart, Secaucus, New Jersey, 1979 \n\n"}

Written by Simon Amstell and long term collaborator Dan Swimer, the series stars Simon Amstell playing a version of himself: an ex-television presenter searching for meaning in his life. Each episode takes place at his Grandma's house, where Grandma (Linda Bassett) welcomes her family, desperate to see everyone happy.\n\nThe first series was shown in 2010, the second in 2012. In December 2012 Amstell stated that there would not be a third series.\n\nThe show was created and written by Simon Amstell and Dan Swimer. Six 30-minutes episodes were produced for the first series by Tiger Aspect Productions for BBC Two. These were filmed at Pinewood Studios.\n\nThe house used for exterior filming is located in Highwood Gardens in Clayhall, Greater London.\n\nOn 1 July 2010, Geoffrey Hutchings, who portrayed Grandpa, died. The death of his character was said to have occurred between the two series.\n\nThe show has received a generally positive reaction from critics and audiences alike. \nTV.com's Ruth Margolis claimed that \"[Amstell's] written a sitcom stuffed with gently funny moments and acerbic gems\", but suggested \"a few more naturalistic pauses would have just polished this into the self-assured comedy it so wants to be.\" Other publications had differing opinions. UK's \"Metro\"' claimed on their website that \"[Amstell's] brilliantly funny but we won’t be inviting him round for tea.\" Sam Wollaston of \"The Guardian\" asked, \"Can Simon act, though? Well, it's hard to know really, given that he's essentially just being himself\", but comes around to the opinion that \"Grandma's House is sharply written, with some nice lines and a bit of edge to it.\" Two weeks later, Wollaston revealed \"I'm enjoying Grandma's House more and more (...) there's a subtlety and a sharpness about it.

Although guest hosts are often undesirable, some shows have seen the guest host do a better job than the main host, and filling in as a guest host has helped to launch the careers of a variety of television and radio talents. In U.S. radio, the concept of a guest host is known as a \"swing jock\".\n\nThis phrase was popularized on \"The Tonight Show\" during Johnny Carson's 30-year reign as host from 1962 to 1992. Toward the end of his tenure, Carson was granted more personal time off, and substitute hosts would be seen on the air more often. \"Permanent guest host\" is an oxymoron that likely originated on \"The Tonight Show\". Some guest hosts of \"The Tonight Show\" have gone on to host talk shows of their own. Jay Leno went on to succeed Johnny Carson; Joan Rivers went on to host \"The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers\" on Fox; and David Brenner hosted the short-lived \"Nightlife\" in the late-1980s. Richard Belzer hosted \"Hot Properties\" on the Lifetime network in the mid-1980s. When Rivers was fired by FOX in 1988, \"The Late Show\" adopted a format consisting only of guest hosts. One of them, Arsenio Hall, went on to his own show, which lasted 1989 to 1994.\n\n\"The View\" first became popular with the guest host format in between the arrivals and departures of the program's youngest co-hosts, Debbie Matenopoulos, Lisa Ling, and Elisabeth Hasselbeck. Although a variety of celebrities took turns in the chair, only the younger co-hosts were eligible for the job. During its tenth season, \"The View\" began featuring a guest host each day; regular Barbara Walters did not appear with anybody yet was considered eligible to replace Star Jones, who left the previous year. Following the departure of Rosie O'Donnell in 2007 the program looked to return to a panel of five women. The moderator role was given to comedian Whoopi Goldberg in August and Jones' role was given to actress and comedian Sherri Shepherd the week following Goldberg's debut. \"The View\" used the guest host format in place of Elisabeth Hasselbeck in 2009 while she was on maternity leave.\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, some shows have guest presenters on a permanent basis. \"Have I Got News for You\" has used a different guest presenter for each show since Angus Deayton's departure in 2002. On \"The Jack Docherty Show\" in the late 1990s, Jack Docherty was absent so often that the show (retitled \"Not the Jack Docherty Show\") more often than not had a fill-in. When Simon Amstell left his role on \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\", guest hosts took over the role to December 2013, not unlike a similar incident during Series 18.\n\n\n"}

It focuses on Miley Stewart (portrayed by Miley Cyrus), who is a teenager living a double life as an average schoolgirl by day and as the famous recording artist Hannah Montana by night, which she keeps secret and only a few people know of her alter ego. The story follows the daily life of Stewart, her brother Jackson, her best friends Lily and Oliver, and her father Robby (Cyrus's real-life country singer father, Billy Ray Cyrus).\n\nThe series, produced by It's a Laugh Productions and Michael Poryes Productions, premiered on Disney Channel on March 24, 2006, garnering 5.4 million views, giving the Disney Channel the highest ratings in its history and concluded on January 16, 2011 after having aired four seasons and ninety-eight episodes. The soundtrack albums \"Hannah Montana\" (2006), \"\" (2007), \"Hannah Montana 3\" (2009), and \"Hannah Montana Forever\" (2010) were released to coincide with their respective seasons. In 2007, the success of the series led to the Best of Both Worlds Tour, which visited North America. The following year, it was adapted into the 3D film \"\" and its accompanying soundtrack. In 2009, the first feature film of the series, titled \"\" was released to commercial success, and was additionally promoted through its accompanying . All seasons of the show have been distributed on DVD.\n\nThe series received generally favorable reviews from critics and was praised by audiences. Although it has been recognized as a \"guilty pleasure\" by several media outlets. The show's instant success is widely credited with the launch of Cyrus's career and her establishment as a teen idol. However, as she continued to develop an increasingly provocative image as the series progressed, the series has received criticism for appearing to be a negative influence on its younger audience.\n\nMiley Stewart lives a double life as an average schoolgirl by day and an international teen idol Hannah Montana by night. Her father Robby Stewart is a successful country music singer under the stage name Robbie Ray, and raises Miley and her brother Jackson Stewart as a single father in Malibu, California after their mother Susan died. Miley's best friend Lilly Truscott discovered her secret while attending a Hannah Montana concert. Later in the first season, Miley herself revealed her secret to their close friend Oliver Oken with the intention of ending his romantic interest in Hannah Montana. Lilly and Oliver assumed the aliases Lola Luftnagle and Mike Standley III when appearing with Hannah in order to protect her secret. Meanwhile, Jackson is employed at Rico's Surf Shop, where his child-aged boss Rico Suave often assigns him to complete embarrassing tasks.\n\nMiley, Lilly, and Oliver begin high school in the second season. Rico, who begins high school after skipping several grades, nearly discovers Miley's secret on several occasions. Later in the season, Miley admits to Jake Ryan, whom she initially disliked and later dated in the second season, that she is Hannah Montana. However, their briefly rekindled relationship ends after he struggles to adopt a normal, non-celebrity lifestyle, which Miley is concerned she will lose as a result of dating the actor.\n\nWhile Miley is off shooting a movie (a parody of Indiana Jones), Lilly and Oliver begin dating in the third season. Though Miley initially feels uncomfortable with the changed dynamic of their friendship, she often helps the pair reconcile after arguing with one another. Miley herself begins dating Jake again, but develops feelings for her bandmate Jesse. Jackson moves into his own apartment while attending college, while Lilly moves in with the Stewart family after her mother finds work in Atlanta, Georgia. In the two-part season finale, Robby buys a ranch in Malibu to bring Miley's horse Blue Jeans from Tennessee, while Jackson leaves his apartment and returns home. Oliver also embarks on a tour with the band that lived above Jackson's former apartment.\n\nIn the fourth season, the Stewart family moves into their new ranch, and Miley finds out that Jake was cheating on her, from Oliver who has a photo of Jake nibbling another girl's ear. She breaks up with him and soon starts to date Jesse. He admits that he discovered her secret by paying attention to her actions, and it begins to inconvenience her friends and family. After much deliberation, Miley reveals to Jay Leno's television audience that she is Hannah Montana. Afterwards, Miley and Lilly graduate high school, with arrangements to attend college. In the series finale, Miley and Lilly prepare to go to college, yet another movie offer comes up. Miley tries to make Lilly reject her, only to fail multiple times. She convinces Lilly to come with her to Paris (where the movie is shooting), however at the airport, Lilly decides not to go, but to return to college (this is due to Oliver convincing Lilly that Miley will get another movie role next year). Miley continues to Paris, only to come back, joining Lilly in Stanford. Jesse and Oliver guest star in that episode and a Montage of pictures play at the end of the episode.\n\nThe first season of \"Hannah Montana\" commenced airing on March 24, 2006 and concluded on March 30, 2007 after broadcasting 26 episodes. An additional episode, titled \"That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana\", served as a crossover episode with \"That's So Raven\" and \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\", and was broadcast on July 28, 2006. The second season had 29 episodes, and aired from April 23, 2007 until October 12, 2008. An additional episode, titled \"No Sugar, Sugar\", was filmed but was not broadcast in the United States after parental complaints alleged that the episode provided inaccurate information regarding diabetes.\n\nThe third season of \"Hannah Montana\" premiered on November 2, 2008 and concluded on March 14, 2010 after broadcasting 30 episodes. Its twentieth episode aired on July 17, 2009 and served as the third and final installment of the \"Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana\" crossover episode; the first was considered an episode of the second season of \"Wizards of Waverly Place\", while the second was produced as an installment of the first season of \"The Suite Life on Deck\". Furthermore, the season was interrupted with the premiere of \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\", which was released on April 10, 2009.\n\nThe fourth and final season of \"Hannah Montana\" was renamed \"Hannah Montana Forever\", and premiered on July 11, 2010. After broadcasting 13 episodes that season, and 98 episodes across all four, the series finale aired on January 16, 2011.\n\nThroughout its run, the series was led by five (seasons 1 and 4) and six (seasons 2–3) primary characters. Its original main characters are Miley Stewart (portrayed by Miley Cyrus), Lilly Truscott (Emily Osment), Oliver Oken (Mitchel Musso), Jackson Stewart (Jason Earles), and Robby Stewart (Billy Ray Cyrus). In the second season, Rico Suave (Moisés Arias), who originally appeared in a supporting capacity during the first season, was integrated into the primary cast. During the fourth and final season, Oken became a supporting character due to Musso's involvement on the television series \"Pair of Kings\", which aired on the sister station Disney XD.\n\nThe aforementioned character's storylines were largely developed by supporting cast members. Susan Stewart (Brooke Shields) is shown as Miley and Jackson's deceased mother in flashback scenes, while Aunt Dolly (Dolly Parton) is portrayed as Miley's godmother (Parton is Cyrus's real-life godmother). Jake Ryan (Cody Linley) was depicted as an actor for the popular television series \"Zombie High\". He briefly attended Seaview Middle School with Stewart, Truscott, and Oken, and engaged in an on-again/off-again relationship with Stewart in several points during \"Hannah Montana\". Roxy Roker (Frances Callier) was close friends with the Stewart family, and additionally served as their bodyguard during public appearances. Amber Addison (Shanica Knowles) and Ashley Dewitt (Anna Maria Perez de Tagle) are shown as stereotypical school divas, and are notably the rivals of Stewart and Truscott. Jesse (Drew Roy) is introduced as one of Miley's later love interests.\nMichael Poryes, who is credited as co-creator, also co-created the hit Disney Channel Original Series \"That's So Raven\". The show is produced by It's a Laugh Productions, Inc. and Michael Poryes Productions, in association with Disney Channel Original Productions. It is filmed at Sunset Bronson Studios in Hollywood, California.\n\nThe original idea for this show was based on the \"That's So Raven\" episode \"Goin' Hollywood\", which served as the backdoor pilot for a sitcom tentatively called \"Better Days\" to star Alyson Stoner, in which a child star of a popular TV show of the same name was to try her hand at going to a normal school. The episode \"New Kid in School\" has the basic premise as that aforementioned episode.\n\nAs the show's concept was further developed, among those considered for the lead role of 'Chloe Stewart' were former \"American Juniors\" finalist Jordan McCoy, future \"Gossip Girl\" actress Taylor Momsen and pop and R&B singer JoJo (who rejected the role). Miley Cyrus originally auditioned for the role of the \"best friend\" Lilly Truscott, but they thought she would be better for the main character, so she tried out for Chloe Stewart/Hannah Montana. Chloe Stewart was later changed to Miley Stewart when Cyrus got the part. The names of Hannah Montana were changed a few times. One of the previous names was Alexis Texas.\n\nIn December 2006, Disney announced plans to release Hannah Montana products, including clothing, jewelry, apparel, and dolls, at selected stores. Play Along Toys released the Hannah Montana fashion dolls, singing dolls, Miley Stewart doll, and other merchandise in August 2007. More Hannah dolls were released in November, along with Oliver, Lilly, and later Jake Ryan dolls. They became one of the most popular Christmas toys in 2007.\n\nAccording to the \"Daily Dispatch\", the TV series held a global audience of 200 million viewers in 2008. \"If Miley’s viewers were a country, they would be the fifth largest population in the world – just ahead of Brazil.\" By February 2008, the Hannah Montana franchise had become so important that Disney convened an \"80-person, all-platform international meeting to discuss Hannah Montana's future\". All Disney business segments were represented at the meeting.\n\nThe theme song for \"Hannah Montana\" is \"The Best of Both Worlds\" written by Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil, produced by Gerrard and performed by Miley Cyrus (as Hannah Montana). John Carta, who also composed the music cues to signify scene changes and commercial breaks for the first season, composed the music for the song. The song's lyrics describe the basic premise of the television series.\n\nThe full-length version of the song, which is 2 minutes, 54 seconds in length, was included on the show's soundtrack, released in October 2006. For the TV version of the theme, which lasts only 50 seconds, only the first two stanzas and the last two were used. \"Just Like You\" and \"The Other Side of Me\" were originally tested for the opening theme song, before \"Best of Both Worlds\" was chosen as the theme.\n\nThe opening sequence for the first two seasons features episode clips of each cast member when their name appears. Each cast member's name is \"wiped\" on the screen in a marquee-light-style. The sequence then switches to full-screen episode clips (most of the clips used in the Season One version of the sequence were of the early produced episodes) with the creator's names appearing in the second-to-last clip. The show's title logo design appears at the beginning and end of the sequence (the latter portion on the \"concert stage\" features Cyrus as her character Hannah Montana). The only change to the sequence for season two were the replacement of episode clips and the addition of the Disney logo above the show's title logo (this particular change was also implemented for later reruns of the first season).\n\nFor season three, a new version of the opening credits was used. It features Miley as herself and Hannah Montana in a Times Square-like setting. The names of the actors and actresses and clips from the show appear in a sort-of marquee board and it features Hannah Montana with her new wig and clothes style. The song playing is a remixed version of \"The Best of Both Worlds\", that was originally recorded for (and heard in) \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\". This marked the first time that a Disney Channel series has completely revamped its opening title sequence. The sequence was reformatted for high definition and slightly altered for season four, with the credit typing changed, the addition of the \"Forever\" wording in the main title logo, the removal of Mitchel Musso from the credit sequence and the inclusion of clips from season four episodes.\n\nThe series premiere of \"Hannah Montana\" garnered 5.4 million views, giving the Disney Channel the highest ratings in its history. The series' most-viewed episode, \"Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas\" aired on August 17, 2007, to an audience of 10.7 million. In doing so, it also became the most-viewed episode on basic cable.\n\nAs Cyrus continued to develop an increasingly provocative image as \"Hannah Montana\" progressed, the series has received criticism for appearing to be a negative influence on its younger audience. In 2010 and 2011, she was recognized as the worst celebrity influence by JSYK, an AOL-owned service, presumably considering a series of sexually-inappropriate pictures and leaked footage of Cyrus smoking \"Salvia divinorum\". In contrast, Cyrus's friend Kelly Osbourne described that such reports \"could not be farther from the truth\", adding that \"she has learned her lesson\" after her \"Salvia divinorum\" incident.\n\nIn 2012, Joe Paul Wilson from the Culture and Media Institute criticized her for \"[becoming] the epitome of the anti-role model for young girls\" after establishing a following through her \"wholesome\" persona as Hannah Montana. Writing for the \"New York Post\", Naomi Schaefer Riley noted that Cyrus \"duped\" the series' audience after assuming an increasingly provocative public image, posing as an \"inherent danger\" for younger children.\n\nAfter a controversial performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, Melissa Henson of the Parents Television Council felt that parents would no longer feel comfortable allowing their children to watch \"Hannah Montana\" \"knowing what Miley's current stage persona is\", and further suggested that Disney would be forced to discontinue the franchise in light of the criticism. Cyrus herself had previously stated her displeasure in not being able to \"erase that stuff [\"Hannah Montana\"] and start over\", and acknowledged her attempts to \"start as a new artist\" with her fourth studio album and first record unaffiliated with Disney, \"Bangerz\" (2013).\n\nBuddy Sheffield alleged that he pitched the concept for a television series titled \"Rock and Roland\" to the Disney Channel in 2001. The program would have focused on a junior high school student who led a secret double life as a rock star, though the network passed on the proposal. However, after \"Hannah Montana\" became a successful franchise, Sheffield filed a lawsuit against the Disney Channel in August 2007, commenting that he was owed \"millions of dollars\" in damages.\n\nIn April 2010, series co-creators Rich Correll and Barry O'Brien filed a lawsuit against the Disney Channel for $5 million over profits from the program. They claimed that they were denied their share of profits and pre-negotiated percentage-based bonuses based on their backend deals and Writers Guild of America, West requirements for writers who receive \"created by\" credits. Correll, who also directed a number of episodes, further alleged that he was unfairly terminated and blackballed by Disney after testifying in connection with a WGA arbitration. A third producer, Michael Poryes, has previously filed a similar lawsuit in October 2008.\n\nThe series is broadcast worldwide on Disney Channel. It premiered on May 6, 2006 in Ireland and it also airs on TRTÉ. In the United Kingdom it premiered on the same date and also airs on Channel 5. In Australia it premiered on August 7, 2006 and on Seven Network on April 7, 2007. It premiered on the same date in New Zealand and airs also on FOUR. It first aired on Family in Canada on August 4, 2006. It premiered in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia, India, Bangladesh, and Singapore on September 23, 2006.

He is best known for being one of the five members (and the only solo comedian) of Downtown Gaki no Tsukai's regular cast. His role on the show is usually divided up between the \"suberi-kyara\" and the \"ijime-kyara\".\n\nOutside of \"Gaki no Tsukai\", he has released three books, a CD single of his signature \"Yamazaki Ichi-ban!\" song, and has appeared in several Yoshimoto Kogyo compilations and DVD releases.\n\nHōsei was born in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo where from the age of five he took an interest in Kendo, later joining a high school Kendo club. He attended Nishinomiya South High School where being humorous was a desirable trait, popular among fellow students they coined the term for him.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Hōsei joined Yoshimoto Kogyo's 6th NSC (New Star Creation) Osaka-based school group in April 1987. In 1988 he teamed up with Hiromitsu Noriyasu to form the \"owarai\" duo GSX (ガスペケ) who performed at the Yoshimoto-run theater alongside many other recruits and graduates, such as Downtown, Itsuji Itao, Koji Higashino and Imada Koji.\n\nIn 1989, Hōsei and Hiromitsu Noriyasu made the move to Tokyo and renamed themselves as , appearing on the nationwide DAY BREAK show.\n\nAround the same time, Downtown also moved on to Tokyo and Team Zero were frequent guests or regulars of their shows including Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!, Downtown Nari and Downtown Juice. In addition to appearing in Yoshimoto Kogyo sponsored shows such as Yoshimoto Village, they also starred in the Funky Monkey Teacher series alongside Jimmy Onishi.\n\nTheir efforts won them the \"Best Newcomer Award\" at ABC's 12th Rookie Comedian Grand Prix on January 15, 1991. However, Hōsei's comedy partner Hiromitsu Noriyasu found a passion for film directing and by the end of September 1993, Team Zero decided to part ways towards their own solo careers.\n\nIn addition to his regular appearances on Downtown's shows such as Gaki no Tsukai and Downtown Kazaana, in 1994 Hōsei also became a regular on Tenshi no U・B・U・G, a late night show hosted by Imada Koji and Koji Higashino. Initially he received much attention for his young appearance, however as his role in comedy gradually cemented towards being the \" suberi-kyara\", his public image quickly changed. Work began to dry up and Hōsei considered quitting comedy until he was amused by an episode of Mutsugoro & Fun Friends, where a little Pug dog barked loudly and hopelessly confronted a large St. Bernard. Taking the underdog as inspiration he tried raising his voice and taking on comically hopeless confrontations, as seen in his \"ijime-kyara\" role, which brought in more work offers.\n\nHōsei appeared in a number of direct-to-video releases, including starring roles in the live-action manga adaptations of Chameleon and Pappakapā. In addition he took on roles within sitcoms, including a semi-regular part as a visiting fishmonger in Pokkapoka, and a regular part in Ken Shimura's sitcom Heisei Shimura Family where, although he was 28 ~ 30 at the time, he played the role of the 20 ~ 22-year-old son. With Denpa Shōnen International he made a number of trips abroad to take on dangerous challenges such as meeting the Mafia in Italy, participating in the Running of the Bulls in Spain and searching for the Chupacabra in Mexico.\n\nHōsei became a children's television presenter on the long-running Tensai Terebi-kun series, which also included performing in a number of stage plays. On set he mentored child actor Eiji Wentz who formally became his apprentice.\n\nAs a solo comedian, Hōsei flits between various regular and irregular appearances on variety shows. From 2000 he co-hosted an MBS internet radio talk show called , mentioning it as one of his only regular sources of work on Gaki no Tsukai's No Laughing series in 2006.\n\nHe began appearing yearly on the Drive A Go! Go! travel program, today his travels mainly focus on onsens around Japan.\n\nBetween 2003–2005 he frequently appeared on Ametalk, establishing a weekly segment where Ameagari Kesshitai would intrude upon him whilst strangely dressed, leading to a comical confrontation with Hiroyuki Miyasako that would inevitably lead to Hōsei's defeat. From 2005 onward he appeared more infrequently as a talk show guest.\n\nHe often performs in Yoshimoto Kogyo stage shows, particularly at the Lumine the Yoshimoto theater where he became known for the catchphrases and . Every so often he takes on drama or film roles such as in Tears of Kitty or the more recent Mentai Piriri 2.\n\nAfter graduating as a rakugo he moved to Osaka but continues to work as a solo comedian within the entertainment industry, typically on Kansai region shows such as Osaka Honwaka TV and Marco Polori, whilst maintaining his regular role on Gaki no Tsukai in the Kantō region. He is a frequent guest on variety talk shows such as Uramayo and Kaitetsu! Emi Channel. Alongside comedian friend Jinnai Tomonori and his mentor Tsukitei Happo he regularly hosts the Yoshimoto Golden Biographies series, interviewing various Yoshimoto Kogyo comedians about their lives.\n\nIn 2008 Hōsei turned 40 and with the sense that he was going through the motions coupled with the public's dwindling reception he was feeling at a loss. After seeking advice from Koji Higashino, Hōsei began to listen to performer Shijaku Katsura II, which sparked a passion for rakugo. He began practicising alone for around six months before approaching rakugo performer Tsukitei Hachimitsu who introduced him to his father, rakugo master Tsukitei Happo. Happo gave him the chance to perform the comical story for an audience on 11 May 2008 then invited him to a nomikai where Hōsei requested an apprenticeship. Happo accepted and thereafter mentored Hōsei for 5 years before submitting an application for him to officially join rakugo society. However, at first there was some reluctance from the governing board as a large part of his prior experience was unrelated to rakugo. Tsukitei Happo appealed the decision and he was permitted to graduate, whereupon he adopted the title Tsukitei Hōsei from 2013 onwards. He later published a book titled \"Why I Became a Rakugo\".\n\nIn an effort to pursue rakugo further, Hōsei moved to Osaka with his family, where the Tsukitei group is based. He now regularly performs at rakugo theaters and festivals around Japan, including charity events. At his first major solo rakugo performance, he received congratulatory flowers from Natsumi Ogawa (Masatoshi Hamada's wife), which he later handed out to attendees as thanks. As rakugo stories are traditionally learnt by listening, Hōsei uses a portable media player with around 2,500 rakugo performances to help with memorization.\n\nHōsei has a keen interest in various aspects of music and plays the piano as a hobby. In 1996, he obliged a viewer who wrote into the \"Downtown Kazaana\" show requesting him to perform a piano piece. Later, in 1999, Downtown would challenge him to perform a piano concert late at night while being terrorized by jump scares. In 2011 Hōsei successfully completed a challenge to perform \"Étude Op. 10, No. 3 by Chopin\" on a miniature toy piano.\n\nComposing is another hobby of his, an aspect heavily utilized within the Yamasaki Produce segments of Gaki no Tsukai, where he creates both the music and lyrics for various songs which the rest of the cast must perform. Outside of this series, he also composed tracks for the debut single of \"AiAi\" in 2002.\n\nHe greatly enjoys singing karaoke and has participated in a number of televised contests, most notably winning first place in the \"15th Comedian Karaoke King\" competition. On other programs he has also parodied many music artists such as Gackt, Exile and V6.\n\nIn addition, Hōsei has taken dance classes with an instructor and once showed footage of him practicing to Lady Gaga music.\n\nHōsei acts as an impersonator and has participated in many contests on this theme, such as Monomane Battle and Monomane Grand Prix, where he mimicked other comedians such as Ayako Imoto or parodied characters on shows like Death Note. During impersonation segments of the Gaki no Tsukai No Laughing series he'll sometimes be called upon multiple times to incite laughter.\n\nFrequently Hōsei impersonates women such as the many popstars of the Shōwa period, or acts in the role of fictional female characters such as the bride at a wedding. In 2008 he won 6th place in a \"Who is the most beautiful transvestite in showbiz\" contest. When Masatoshi Hamada was chosen to cross-dress in the Gaki no Tsukai No Laughing series, he commented that, \"Yamazaki should do this.\"\n\nAt one time Hōsei studied English for two years. In 1999, Imada Koji mentioned that he, Ameagari Kesshitai and a junior visited Hōsei's home for English conversation practise. He has also chosen to sing the occasional song in English, such as \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes by The Platters\" which got a passing score in a karaoke contest. However the full extent of his present-day English proficiency is unknown.\n\nAfter feeling a sense of anxiety from the highs and lows of the entertainment industry, Hōsei sought to expand his skill base and gain further qualifications to fall back on. As well as English and piano, he dabbled in various subjects such as computers and game creation to varying degrees of proficiency before settling into his rakugo studies. At the age of 32 he enrolled on an 8-year Psychology course at Rissho University but lost enthusiasm halfway through and dropped out.\n\n\"Suberu\" literally means “to slip”, but in owarai lingo, \"subetta\" refers to a joke or gag that fails to grab any laughs or reaction. (\"Kyara\", short for \"kyarakuta\" or character.)<br>\nYamasaki's persona on the show (and in the owarai community in general) is of the unfunny underdog who tries very hard to be funny, but fails. His failure is always accentuated by a snide remark from one of the other members of the show. Though his jokes may be amusing, members will intentionally stifle their laughter to satisfy the running gag.\n\n\"Ijimeru\" means to bully or pick on someone. Of all the members of \"Gaki no Tsukai\", Yamasaki takes the most physical abuse. The entire series, Yamasaki Vs. Moriman, is based around a series of bizarre wrestling matches in which Yamasaki always loses to the larger and powerful Holstein Morio from the comedy duo, Moriman. The content of the matches changes with each battle, but past matches have found the two tossing hot cooking oil at one another, trying to force each other into a tub of blue kakigori syrup, and whacking one another with thick burdock roots.\n\nEvery year since 2007 during the \"No Laughing\" New Years Specials, Yamasaki inevitably comes face to face with an irate Masahiro Chono; a pro-wrestler, and is slapped.\n\nHōsei's tearful marriage was broadcast on Gaki no Tsukai in 2001. Aya Yamazaki would later feature in an episode highlighting her quirky answers to various questions. He has two daughters named Rara-chan and Momo-chan. On September 8, 2012 his son Tenma-kun was born, Hōsei has noted how his birthday matches Hitoshi Matsumoto.\n\nHōsei enjoys mahjong and invited Hitoshi Matsumoto to play with him as part of his 20th anniversary special. As an avid reader he became addicted to the work of Keigo Higashino.\n\nAt one time he engaged in table tennis matches with junior entertainers at a local community center. He also notes jet-skiing as a hobby and enjoys watching American series such as Desperate Housewives.\n\nAs Hōsei travels around Japan performing rakugo, he keeps a to commemorate his visits.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She received the Nadia Boulanger scholarship and studied in Paris with Brian Ferneyhough at Royaumont in 1995, Tristan Murail in 1996, and at IRCAM Cursus in Music Computing 1997-98 with Hans Tutschku and Mikhail Malt. . Koh was a composer-in-residence at the Herrenhaus Edenkoben in 2004. In 2007, Koh become a founding faculty member of the music department of School of the arts, Singapore, and then became Vice-Dean (interdisciplinary studies) at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in 2010. Koh is a founding member of the Composers' Society of Singapore and served as its President 2013-16. \n\n\nKoh’s music has been performed by BBC Symphony Orchestra, Hungarian Radio Budapest Symphony Orchestra, Stavanger Symphony Orchestra, Singapore Symphony Orchestra, Résonance Contemporaine, The Song Company of Australia, Nieuw Ensemble, Take 5, and Reconsil, as well as by soloists including [Prodromos Symeonidis]], Frode Haltli, and Thalia Myers. Her compositions for dance include a series of works with The Arts Fission Company, for example ‘In the Name of Red’ (2015), a site-specific work for the inauguration festival of the National Gallery Singapore). Leaning on her concept of multimedia performance as a \"theatre of music\", Koh created Away We Go (2015) together with Étienne Turpin, commissioned by NTU Centre of Contemporary Art), and On the String (2010), commissioned by Singapore Arts Festival). She co-created the interactive sound installation The Canopy (2010-13), presented at World Stage Design Festival (UK 2013) and International Computer Music Conference (UK 2011). Koh collaborated with theatre director Steve Dixon on adapting T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\" in a one-actor piece with video and electroacoustic sound. \n\nKoh learned the piano from an early age. Her fascination for resonating strings in particular and sonic timbre in general led to taking up music professionally, coming to think of composition as a form of ‘calligraphy on a sonic canvas’. Through computer-assisted composition and audio processing, she could imagine sounds beyond those produced by acoustic instruments, and sonic space. She developed a concept of \"theatre of music\", where the sonic canvas became physical, i.e., the stage. That is, \"whilst the narrative structure of the composition may be based on theatrical devices, the sound objects (effectively the play’s characters) are driven by musical identities and relationships\". Koh’s work often starts with an external structure from architecture, calligraphy, or science. The 2010 multimedia performance ‘On the String’ is a consolidation of this approach. Asking herself: “What if we could hear the sounds of vibrating one-dimensional strings? Or the sonic texture created by various vibration patterns of a string curving space? If these imaginings were audible, what would they sound like?” Composition becomes a \"systematic musicalisation of certain features of the scientific thought and, through interdisciplinary investigations (music, visual arts, interactive design, instrument design, light), culminates in a multimedia performance\". \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was published by Sunflowers Interactive in Europe in 2004 and Paradox Entertainment in North America in 2005. The game takes place in Medieval Europe, spanning the early centuries of the second millennium in three historical time periods. The player can choose to play as one of over 100 playable kingdoms.\n\n\"Knights of Honor\" is played on a large map of Europe spanning from Ireland to Armenia and from Scandinavia to the northern coast of Africa. The map is divided into parcels of land called provinces. Each province is governed by a city and contains several \"Rural Areas\" which can be towns, farms, monasteries and coast towns. These rural areas can't be altered and are placed randomly across the map before each game. The city, however has room for several buildings which can give bonuses to the rural areas or the city itself, such as more piety in the monasteries when a church is built or a higher income from the towns when a market is present in the city. Other buildings are needed to recruit certain units (such as a swordsmith for sword-wielding units or a fletcher for bow-wielding units) or to defend the city such as walls and towers. A city only has limited room for buildings. Thus, not all buildings can be built in a city and the player must carefully consider what to build for a particular city. Compared to other strategy games, building structures in \"KOH\" takes a rather long time. The main goal of the game is to become emperor of Europe. However, the player is free to do whatever they wish. There is no set time limit.\n\nThere are three kinds of resources which can be spent on a variety of upgrades. Money is needed to recruits units, build buildings, etc. It is earned by taxes, trading and kingdom power. Piety is used for increasing your kingdom power and converting provinces to your religion. Books are used to educate your knights and adopting provinces. Towns themselves also generate hammers (used to construct certain buildings) and food which determines how long they can withstand sieges.\n\nReligion plays an important role in Knights of Honor. There are 4 different types of religion: The Catholic Church, The Orthodox Church, Islam, and Paganism. The catholic Pope has much influence in medieval Europe. He can excommunicate catholic kingdoms and call for crusades against non-catholic kingdoms. When a player chooses to go on a crusade they are granted powerful Crusader units. When the Pope dies, his successor is chosen among several clerics throughout Europe. If the player happens to have a very experienced cleric, there is a chance he will be chosen as Pope. From then on, the player controls the Pope and can choose to excommunicate kingdoms and call for crusades, a successful crusade can result in a puppet state that is unquestionably loyal to the leader of the crusade or plunder the town for a huge sum of gold. The Catholic Church is located in Western Europe and the Mediterranean. Orthodox factions are located in south east Europe and answer to Byzantium. These factions can declare independence and form their own churches which grants them a greater sum of gold while lacking the disadvantage of being excommunicated which results in a gold penalty. Islamic empires have the ability to call a Jihad which is similar to a Crusade and will cause armies to spawn at their borders and attack any invaders or rebels. This is a powerful ability but it has a long cool down period . Islam is found in north Africa and the middle east. Paganism is the smallest religion being found only in Scandinavia and some parts of eastern Europe. Pagans do not collect piety (a religious resource used to build certain units and buildings and perform some diplomatic options) so are free to focus on gold and are not troubled by religious problems such as religious tension but they have a penalty on their income and have bad relations with all other religions. Paganism is the only religion the player or other kingdoms cannot convert to, the only way to play as a pagan nation is to start the game as one. The player can renounce his faith and adopt another official religion (except paganism) but such religious conflict will often split the kingdom up and one must reunify the nations as a result.\n\nProvinces can have up to three attributes called \"\"province features\" which allow the construction of certain buildings. For instance if a province contains fertile soil, an apiary can be built in that province. These buildings give access to \"trade goods\" which have a number of positive effects on the kingdom. For example, horses allows mounted units, wine makes a population happier and silver brings in extra money. Controlling such provinces is the key to success in \"Knights of Honor\".\nBesides trade goods, which can be obtained in provinces where the right province features are present or by importing them from other kingdoms, there is another type of goods called \"exotic goods\". These goods can't be produced within a province but have to be imported by means of an admiralty, the upgraded version of a harbour. Examples are ivory, gems and spices.\nExotic goods, together with trade goods, are needed to activate so called \"kingdom advantages\". There are ten different kingdom advantages each requiring a different set of trade and exotic goods and each giving a different advantage. For instance, the kingdom advantage \"Secret Order\"\", which gives a bonus to spies, requires the following trade goods: columns, statues, silver and dyes and the following exotic goods: ebony and ivory.\n\nControlling many provinces certainly gives an advantage over other kingdoms not only because of more income but also because of the goods and eventually the kingdom advantages. However, larger kingdoms are harder to maintain and defend.\n\nA large community of modders created a lot of content for the game, though nowadays almost all has been lost in the closure of Sunflowers/Black Sea Studios Website. But some mods have been restored and have been recently developed thanks to the nostalgia of some players. One of them has created a mod which allow to play on new monitor resolution such as Full HD - 1920x1080 and 1366x768p. It adds many new content and tweaks. \n"}

Post-apocalyptic fiction is set in a world or civilization after such a disaster. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized).\n\"Apocalypse\" is a Greek word referring to the end of the world. Apocalypticism is the religious belief that there will be an apocalypse, a term which originally referred to a revelation of God's will, but now usually refers to belief that the world will come to an end very soon, even within one's own lifetime.\n\nApocalyptic fiction does not portray catastrophes, or disasters, or near-disasters that do not result in apocalypse. A \"threat\" of an apocalypse does not make a piece of fiction apocalyptic. For example, \"Armageddon\" and \"Deep Impact\" are considered disaster films and not apocalyptic fiction because, although earth and/or human-kind are terribly threatened, in the end they manage to avoid destruction. Apocalyptic fiction is not the same as fiction that provides visions of a dystopian future. George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", for example, is dystopian fiction, not apocalyptic fiction.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21812910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21812910", "title": "LoveGame", "text": "LoveGame\n\n\"LoveGame\" is a song by American singer Lady Gaga from her debut studio album, \"The Fame\" (2008). Produced by RedOne, the track was released as the album's third single in North America and Europe and the fourth single in Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden after \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\". \"LoveGame\" was also released as the fourth single in the United Kingdom, after \"Paparazzi\".\n\nCritics appreciated the song's rhythm and the \"I wanna take a ride on your disco stick\" hook. Gaga had explained that the term \"disco stick\" is a euphemism for a penis and was inspired by her sexual attraction to a stranger at a night club. Musically carrying the vibe of underground New York discos, \"LoveGame\" talks about love, fame, and sexuality which was the central theme of the album. The song received a number of remixes, one of them featuring rocker Marilyn Manson. \"LoveGame\" was a commercial success, charting within the top ten in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, France, Germany, and other European countries. It became Gaga's third consecutive number-one song on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Top 40 chart and achieved triple platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nThe New York underground-inspired music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn, and portrayed Gaga dancing at an underground subway station and in a parking lot. The music video was a tribute from the singer to the New York lifestyle including its glamour, fans and fashion. It was influenced by the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Bad\", which also took place in a subway station, and features Gaga wearing Nazi chic fashion. The music video was banned from broadcast at the PG-rated time slots in Australian television channels because of its sexual content. \"LoveGame\" has been performed live a number of times by Gaga, including The Fame Ball and The Monster Ball tours, where she performed it while holding her characteristic disco stick in one hand.\n\nTowards the end of 2007, Lady Gaga's management company introduced her to songwriter and producer RedOne, whom they also managed. By 2008, Gaga relocated to Los Angeles in order to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, \"The Fame\", and set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga. \"LoveGame\" was one of the songs written by Gaga and RedOne who also produced the track. With \"Rolling Stone\", Gaga explained that she was at a nightclub and had a \"sexual crush\" on somebody. She went up to the person and uttered the line, \"I wanna ride on your disco stick\". Thinking it to be a thoughtful metaphor for penis, Gaga went to the recording studio the next day and wrote the song in roughly four minutes. Gaga also had ideas for the live performance of the song where she used \"an actual stick—it looks like a giant rock-candy pleasuring tool—that lights up\".\n\nWhile commenting in regards to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, \"Rove\", Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her \"disco stick\" metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on Network Ten in Australia. She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics constituted off. \"If anything, I happen to think people are frivolously hard on me\", Gaga generalized. She went on to relegate \"lot of youth-oriented pop music\" as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react. \"It's the music in relation to the visual, in relation to the way I move and the way I articulate the lyrics. But if I wanted to make music to make people sing 'la di da' that would be very boring,\" she concluded.\n\n\"LoveGame\" was released as the album's third single in North America and Europe and the fourth single in Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden after \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\". In the US it was sent to Contemporary hit radio (CHR) formats for airplay from May 12, 2009. The track initially had been planned as the third single release in the United Kingdom, but deeming its lyrics and music video potentially controversial, it was decided that \"Paparazzi\" would be released instead. \"LoveGame\" has received a number of remix treatments, one of which featured vocals from rocker Marilyn Manson. Daniel Kreps from \"Rolling Stone\" reported that the remix was conceived during Gaga's photoshoot with the magazine in May 2009, when Manson arrived on the set. The rocker was impressed by the shoot and wanted to collaborate with Gaga on \"LoveGame\". In return, Gaga also lent vocals for a remix of a song from Manson's seventh studio album, \"The High End of Low\" (2009).\n\n\"LoveGame\" was recorded at Record Plant Studios in Hollywood and at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Along with the production work of the track, RedOne also contributed to its background vocals, instrumentation, programming, audio engineering and recording. Other personnel involved in creating the final version of the song included Robert Orton who did the audio mixing, and Gene Grimaldi who mastered the song at Oasis Mastering, Burbank, California.\n\nMusically, \"LoveGame\" is an uptempo synth-pop and electro-R&B song. According to Kerri Mason of \"Billboard\", the composition has a vibe of the New York downtown musical scene, but has a more mainstream appeal to it, making it perfect for radio, \"without losing its smut and sass\". The song does not have a massive sound like previous single \"Poker Face\", nor has a big melody like subsequent single, \"Paparazzi\". Instead the composition of the song is electro-R&B, consisting of big beats and a number of hooks, with Gaga repeating the word \"huh!\" from time to time.\n\nGaga explained that the lyrics of \"LoveGame\" were clear about what the song is all about. She thought that the lyrics portrayed a powerful message about love, fame, and sexuality which was the central theme of \"The Fame\". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, \"LoveGame\" is set in the time signature of common time and is composed in the key of B minor with a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute. Gaga's vocal range spans from B to G. It follows in the chord progression of Am–Dm–C–Am–Dm–C in the first two verse and chorus while progressing as Am–Dm–Am–Dm in the intermediate verse before the final chorus.\n\nThe song received mostly positive reviews from critics. \"The Phoenix\" music editor Daniel Brockman said that \"Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy song writing and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon.\" He also commented on the lyrics saying that \"'Let's have some fun, this beat is sick / I wanna take a ride on your disco stick' might be the trashiest-yet-awesomest refrain I've heard on a major-label record this year.\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized the song for \"cheap\" lyrics and \"painfully enunciat[ing] without any resemblance of actual sex appeal\". While reviewing \"The Fame\", BBC said that the song sounded robotic in the line \"I wanna take a ride on your disco stick\", though deemed it a brilliant track which \"leaves us awarding Gaga the yearbook title of 'pop star most likely to kill'.\"\n\nNick Levine from Digital Spy believed that lines like \"I wanna take a ride on your disco stick\" was a direct reason of Gaga's commercial success. Although he felt that the song was \"attention-seeking\", he knew that it would provoke reaction from the masses, be it good or bad. Genevieve Koski from \"The A.V. Club\" called the song as a \"propulsive club anthem\" and complimented its synths and drum programming. She described it aurally as \"a dizzying sonic trip that approximates the high point of a chemically enhanced night of club-hopping.\" Evan Sawdey from \"PopMatters\" complimented RedOne's production on the song, listing it as one of the best tracks on \"The Fame\".\n\nBen Hogwood from musicOMH declared the song as \"top notch, diamond-encrusted pop\" along with other tracks like \"Starstruck\" and \"Paparazzi\". He found the lyrics to be sometimes odd, especially the statement, \"I'm on a mission, and it involves some heavy touchin'.\" Sarah Rodman of \"The Boston Globe\" said that the song \"has a gutter level quippage with sinuous moves\". Priya Elan from \"The Times\" was not impressed with the song and called it calculated. \"Billboard\" music editor Chris Williams gave the song a positive review, commenting that \"It has all the winning ingredients of its predecessors: a radio-friendly, club/electropop feel; a provocative, yet silly enough catchphrase and hook; and a dash of '80s synth magic, so the adults can play along. On 'LoveGame' Gaga is in it to win it.\"\n\nWhile reviewing \"The Fame\" on its fifth anniversary, Bradley Stern from Idolator noted that \"LoveGame\" could \"easily be erased from Gaga's back catalog with little consequence\" since he felt it to be nothing more than an \"electro-dance\" track. But Stern believed that \"LoveGame\" was an important component of Gaga's career trajectory, since it was the last testament of her image as \"that of the disco-stick wielding pop star from out of space\"—the image was later deconstructed as the doomed starlet in the music video of \"Paparazzi\". He concluded by saying that the song \"is a wonderful moment of pop frivolity which served to keep the upstart Lady Gaga machine chugging along at the beginning of her career.\"\n\nFollowing its release, \"LoveGame\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 96 for the week ending April 4, 2009, but fell off the chart the following week. After six weeks it reached number six on the Hot 100 by selling 107,000 digital downloads and becoming the week's greatest digital gainer. Two weeks later, \"LoveGame\" peaked at number five on the chart. It reached number-one on the Hot Dance Club Songs, and also became Gaga's third number-one on the Mainstream Top 40 chart. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified \"LoveGame\" double platinum for shipment of two million copies across United States. It has sold 2.66 million digital downloads in the United States as of February 2018, according to Nielsen Soundscan.\n\nIn Canada, the song debuted on the Canadian Hot 100 at number 68 before its official release as a single. Its second appearance was on the chart of January 10, 2009, at number 87. After a few weeks, \"LoveGame\" entered the top ten of the Canadian Hot 100 and climbed to number five. After fluctuating down the chart for a few weeks \"LoveGame\" reached a new peak of two on the chart. The song was certified double platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) in June 2009, for sales of 160,000 paid digital downloads.\n\nIn Australia, the song debuted at number 92 on the ARIA Charts, and then moved up the charts to number 41 the next week. On the issue dated May 11, 2009, the song peaked at number four, becoming Gaga's third top five single there. \"LoveGame\" was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 70,000 copies of the single. In New Zealand, the song debuted at number 36 and moved up to a peak of number 12. The Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) certified it gold for shipment of 7,500 copies of the single. On the issue dated March 6, 2009, the song entered the Irish Singles Chart at number 49 and peaked at number 30, after eight weeks on the chart. It also debuted at number 19 in Finland and has since moved to a peak of number 12.\n\nIn early 2009, the song charted on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number 89 based on downloads only. It re-entered the chart at number 64 after the release of the single was announced, and peaked at 19, becoming her lowest-charting single in the UK at that time. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it silver, for sales of 200,000 copies. In the Netherlands the song debuted at number 28 and has peaked at number five. The song debuted at number six in France and moved to its peak of number five the next week. It debuted at numbers 19 and 38 on the Belgian Ultratop Flanders and Wallonia charts respectively. In Flanders it has reached a peak of six, while in Wallonia it moved to a peak of five. \"LoveGame\" also reached a peak of number seven on the \"Billboard\" European Hot 100 Singles chart.\n\nThe music video of \"LoveGame\" was directed by Joseph Kahn and premiered on March 23, 2009, in Australia, and on August 13, 2009, in the UK on 4Music channel. The video mainly takes place in a subway station, hence several scenes are reminiscent to Michael Jackson's \"Bad\" music video, which was also shot in a similar location. The music video for \"LoveGame\" was shot back-to-back with the video for \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\" on the weekend of January 9, 2009, inside a warehouse at the Port of Los Angeles. Although the video was filmed in Los Angeles, it nevertheless has a New York City setting.\n\nGaga spoke to Whitney Pastorek of \"Entertainment Weekly\" during a \"Behind the Scenes\" episode of the shoot, about her inspirations for the video. She wanted to have a \"giant\" dance video with \"LoveGame\", describing it as \"plastic, beautiful, gorgeous, sweaty, tar on the floor\". There would be scary and dangerous looking men also in the video. Gaga had the idea of portraying herself and her co-actors as New York inhabitants taking on the role of designers, performance artists, dancers etc. She enlisted people from downtown New York as dancers, who normally would not get cast in a video.\n\nOne of the props developed for the video was a pair of sunglasses made of wire. According to Gaga, she imagined \"a downtown, bad-ass kid walking down the street with his buddies, grabbing a pair of pliers, and making a pair of sunglasses out of a fence on the street\". She wore them on the opening shot of the music video along with a chain link hood garment, saying that \"they look so hard. It looks like I plied them right out of the fence and put them on my face\".\n\nThe video starts with the heading \"Streamline presents\" and three men moving through Times Square. They open a manhole cover on which \"Haus of Gaga\" is written. Gaga is then shown naked with blue and purple paint and glitter on her body, frolicking with two men who have the words \"Love\" and \"Fame\" shaved into their heads. The scene shifts to a subway where Gaga starts singing in a grey-white leotard with a hood. She carries her characteristic disco stick and wears chain-linked glasses. The chorus starts with Gaga and her dancers progressing through the subway and dancing down a staircase. Two harlequin Great Danes, are also shown on top of the staircase. \n\nThe video shifts to a train where the second verse takes place with choreographed dance routines and Gaga wearing a black jacket. During the intermediate music, Gaga is shown entering a ticket booth with an inspector while kissing and caressing. As the camera pans from right to left the inspector changes from a man to woman in each frame. According to Emma Hope Allwood of \"Dazed\", in the clip Gaga wears Nazi chic fashion based on an outfit Charlotte Rampling wore in \"The Night Porter\" (1974); Allwood noted that the outfit had previously been appropriated in the videos for Madonna's \"Justify My Love\" (1990) and Marilyn Manson's \"The Fight Song\" (2001). The final scene shows Gaga doing a choreographed dance routine with her crew of backup dancers. The video comes to an end as Gaga and her dancers hold their groins, gesturing towards the camera.\n\nThe music video was censored in many countries after its release in 2009. The video faced censorship troubles in Australia where it was rated AV18+ by Network Ten for the \"suggestive video footage involving bondage and sexual acts\". The channel demanded an edited version of the video which would not violate censorship rules. \"Video Hits\" refused to air the video in its G- and PG-rated time slots. They cited \"numerous sexual references both visually and lyrically\" as the reason they could not create a child-friendly edit without bleeping the repeated hook \"I wanna take a ride on your disco stick\". However, Australian programs like \"Rage\" and cable networks Channel V and MTV aired the video in its original form.\n\nThe video also faced a ban from MTV Arabia citing the same reason as Australia. Since it was very rare to ban videos on MTV, head of MTV Arabia Samer al Marzouki commented, \"We represent the young generation's mentality and culture so we can't play something that conflicts with that. If they can't watch something comfortably with their brother, sisters or friends then we will not play it.\" In the United States, VH1 and MTV played an edited version that removed the scenes showing Gaga naked, and blurred the label on a bottle of alcohol held by a dancer, but they did not change the lyrics.\n\nGaga first performed \"LoveGame\" live in June 2008 on the Isle of Malta special of MTV Asia. She later performed it on the UK program, \"The Album Chart Show\", on February 4, 2009, while promoting \"The Fame\". On March 20, 2009, the song was performed live at the AOL Sessions along with Gaga's other singles such as \"Just Dance\", \"Paparazzi\", \"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\", and an acoustic version of \"Poker Face\". An acoustic version of \"LoveGame\" was performed at the MTV Sessions in January 2009.\n\nThe song was a major part of Gaga's The Fame Ball Tour as the second number of the set list, and was performed alongside album track, \"Starstruck\". Gaga wore a silver and black short skirt looking like a tutu and shaped like a peplum. She had a triangular piece attached on the dress on her right breast, and completed her look with high heeled ultra spike shoes.\nOn May 17, 2009, Gaga performed the song live on Australian talk show, \"Rove\". She also performed the song at the season finale of the eighth season of \"Dancing with the Stars\". A remixed version of \"Poker Face\" and \"LoveGame\" was performed at the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards (MMVA), during the indoor-outdoor street-side show. The performance, which included Gaga being trapped in a fake subway car surrounded by fake police officers, was billed as a tribute to New York City. In 2014, \"Toronto Sun\" listed the performance as the fifth most \"jaw-dropping\" moment in the history of MMVAs, when Gaga introduced her characteristic \"flaming bra\" during the song. On September 8, 2009, Gaga performed \"LoveGame\" at the season seven premiere of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\". A version featuring a full live band was performed at the thirty-fifth season of American comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\", while wearing a big gyroscope-like contraption that rotated around Gaga.\n\nIn late 2009, \"LoveGame\" was added to the set list of Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. In the original version of the tour, the singer wore an off-white costume with skeletal lighted headgear and breastplates shaped like ribs. On the revamped shows of The Monster Ball (2010–2011) \"LoveGame\" was introduced during the second act and featured a New York City subway car on stage from which Gaga and her dancers emerged. While wearing a revealing plastic dress and an exaggerated nun's habit, Gaga wielded the disco stick, which was modified to look like a torch.\n\nThe song was also included on the set list of the 2012 Born This Way Ball tour, where it was shortened and the singer performed it wearing a Statue of Liberty styled head piece. Gaga ventured into the crowd during the song, through the extended pathways from the stage. Joey Guerra from the \"Houston Chronicle\" believed that the appearance of \"LoveGame\" during the tour proved it to be a far superior track than the ones from Gaga's second studio album, \"Born This Way\" (2011). In 2017, Gaga performed \"LoveGame\" during her headline performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. She wore a black outfit with a bright light shining from her belt buckle. On the Joanne World Tour (2017–2018), Gaga performed the track decked in a light blue Swarovski-embelished bodysuit and knee-high boots, while holding a new disco stick in her hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from \"The Fame\" album liner notes.\n\n"}
{"id": "2229454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229454", "title": "Mark Twain Tonight!", "text": "Mark Twain Tonight!\n\nMark Twain Tonight! is a one-man play devised by Hal Holbrook, in which he depicts Mark Twain giving a dramatic recitation selected from several of Twain's writings, with an emphasis on the comic ones.\n\nThe recitation's genesis was a show that Holbrook performed with his first wife Ruby in which she would interview him portraying famous people in history, including Twain. Holbrook revised the concept into a one-man show in the 1950s, first performing it at the Lock Haven State Teachers College in Pennsylvania in 1954. He made his first New York City appearance as Twain in the Off-Broadway engagement in 1959 and premiered it on Broadway in 1966. Holbrook's performance was first noticed by New York producer John Lotas at The Lambs Club in Manhattan. Lotas presented the show at the Forty-First Street Theatre, where it ran for 174 performances. He won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for that appearance and an Emmy Award nomination for the 1967 television broadcast (which was produced by David Susskind) on CBS.\n\nThe last performance on Broadway was in 2006. Holbrook was known to alternate the material that he performed. The original program from the 1959 Off-Broadway engagement included the note “While Mr. Twain’s selections will come from the list below, we have been unable to pin him down as to which of them he will do. He claims this would cripple his inspiration. However, he has generously conceded to a printed program for those who are in distress and wish to fan themselves.” This appeared on programs for the show until Holbrook abruptly announced his retirement from the show in September 2017.\n\nAt the time of his retirement, Holbrook noted that he had been performing under the name \"Mark Twain\" 13 years longer than its originator: Samuel Clemens had adopted the pseudonym at age 24 and died at the age of 74.\n\nIn an interview with William Goldman, Holbrook explained how he structured the show. \"Who wants to see an evening about a literary figure? I knew that in the first act I had to overcome that natural reluctance, so my biggest desire was to make them laugh their asses off at the start, so they'd go out at intermission and say, 'Hey, this guy's funny.' The second act became the social-comment act. I'd start with some funny material to get them again (but not too much of it, or they'd never stop laughing and take the show right away from you). In the last act I gave them the Twain they'd been expecting all along: warm, whimsical, memories of childhood.\"\n\nHolbrook adapted to concerns that presenting Mark Twain as on an 1890s lecture circuit would use racial slurs acceptable in that era, but unacceptable to modern audiences. Challenging the critics, Holbrook often chose to read a passage from \"Huckleberry Finn\" where the orphaned, pipe-smoking, uneducated youngster, Huck, faces a poignant moral dilemma. Holbrook altered the narration to use the dialectally milder \"Nigra\" as the young boy wrestles with his conscience over following the law or his heart concerning \"the widow's Nigra, Jim,\" a runaway slave. Audiences have embraced this presentation as the boy ultimately rejects the legal, societal and even religious ramifications in favor of helping the runaway on his quest for freedom. It is one of the more somber segments of a usually humorous presentation, which Holbrook has felt important to continue in the spirit of Twain's own message.\n\nOn the occasion of Mr. Clemens's 175th birthday (November 30, 2010), Holbrook performed \"Mark Twain Tonight!\" in Elmira, New York, at the Clemens Center in front of a sell-out crowd. April 21, 2010 was the 100th anniversary of his death. The evening began with the singing of happy birthday to Mr. Clemens followed by Holbrook's appearance on stage. 2014 marked the 60th consecutive year that Holbrook has performed \"Mark Twain Tonight!\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31614435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31614435", "title": "Negermusik", "text": "Negermusik\n\nNegermusik (\"Negro Music\") was a pejorative term used by the Nazis during the Third Reich to signify musical styles and performances by African-Americans that were of the jazz and swing music genres. They viewed these musical styles as inferior works belonging to an \"inferior race\" and therefore prohibited. The term, at that same time, was also applied to indigenous music styles of black Africans.\n\nAt the time of the Weimar Republic during 1927, Ernst Krenek's opera of \"Jonny spielt auf\" (\"Jonny Plays\") contained jazz musical performances that caused protests among some right-wing ethnic-nationalist groups in Germany at the time. In 1930, the American musician Henry Cowell wrote in the \"Melos\" journal that jazz interpreted a mixture of African-American and Jewish elements, stating that:\n\"The fundamentals of jazz are the syncopation and rhythmic accents of the Negro. Their modernization is the work of New York Jews [...] So jazz is Negro music seen through the eyes of the Jews.\" \n\nSuch views were readily picked up by the Nazis. Their criticisms have included \"gratuitous use of syncopation\" and \"orgies of drums\". More statements from the Nazis included such things as \"artistic licentiousness\" and \"corruption seed in the musical expression\" with \"indecent dance forms\". They went on to scrutinize all modern music of the 1930s as a \"political weapon of the Jews\". On 4 May 1930, Wilhelm Frick, the Reich's newly appointed Minister of the Interior and Education for Thuringia made a decree called \"Against the Negro Culture — For Our German Heritage\".\n\nIn 1932 the national government under Franz von Papen pandered to the Nazis by banning all public performances by black musicians. After Adolf Hitler gained power in 1933, the Reich's Music Chamber was also created in that same year. This was then followed by a full legal ban on this music on October 12, 1935 across all German national radio. This ban was spearheaded by the German Reich's radio conductor, Eugen Hadamovsky, who purportedly stated:\n\"Mit dem heutigen Tag spreche ich ein endgültiges Verbot des Negerjazz für den gesamten Deutschen Rundfunk aus.\"\n(in English- \"As of today, I am speaking on a definitive ban on the negro jazz for the entire German Radio.\").\n\nIn 1938, the Nazis organized the '\"Entartete Musik\"' public exhibition in Germany, mainly held in Düsseldorf. This exhibition included a poster displaying a cartoon caricature of an African-American male playing on a saxophone with the Star of David on his tuxedo lapel. The overall theme of the exhibition was defamation of contemporary American music as \"Negro music\" and as another Jewish 'plot' upon German culture.\n\nThe \"Swing Kids\" (German: Swingjugend) were a group of jazz and swing lovers in Germany in the 1930s, mainly in Hamburg (St. Pauli) and Berlin. They were mainly composed of 14- to 18-year-old boys and girls. They defied National Socialism (Nazism) by listening and dancing to this same banned music in private quarters, clubs, rented halls and vacant cafés. Jazz music was offensive to Nazi ideology, because it was often performed by blacks and a number of Jewish musicians. The Swing Kids gave the impression of being apolitical, similar to their zoot suiter counterparts in North America.\n\nOn 18 August 1941, in a brutal police operation, over 300 Swing kids were arrested. The measures against them ranged from cutting their hair and sending them back to school under close monitoring, to the deportation of their leaders to Nazi concentration camps.\n\nThe 1993 movie \"Swing Kids\" gives a fictional portrayal of these same youths in that period in Germany.\n\nPrior to the D-Day landings, during the German occupation of the Netherlands, Joseph Goebbels's propaganda ministry published pamphlets written in Dutch named \"Greetings from England - The Coming Invasion\". These pamphlets contained in-between statements, such as \"old jazz-records\" and a further full statement declaring \"at the celebration of liberation your daughters and wives will be dancing in the arms of real Negroes\". This further equated jazz music with 'blackness' during this time to stir up racism and anti-Allied propaganda within occupied Europe.\n\nHowever, Goebbels managed to create a Nazi-sponsored German swing band named Charlie and his Orchestra whose propagandistic purpose was to win over Nazi support and sympathy from British and American listeners through Shortwave radio.\n\nAdditionally counter-propaganda was used by Allied forces which played upon the fears of the Nazi's banned music. One such example is Glenn Miller, who was a White American jazz musician, that initially provided jazz music, through radio, to Allied combat soldiers for the purposes of entertainment and morale. His same music was used as counter-propaganda by AFN radio broadcasting to denounce fascist oppression in Europe with even Miller once stating himself:\n\"America means freedom, and there's no expression of freedom quite so sincere as music.\"\"-Glenn Miller\"\n\nEven in the Post–World War II years in 1950's Germany, there were some protests from churches, school authorities and politicians against the \"obscene Negro music\" of the newly emerging rock 'n' roll genre with such acts like Elvis and Chuck Berry gaining new popularity amongst youth. This attitude also continued right up into the 1960s carrying the same derogatory term that not only maintained its resentment by older generations and conservatives but also was an aggressive defense against a then new contemporary American culture. Dance halls in East-Germany often displayed \"Affentanzen verboten\" notices (lit.: \"monkey dancing forbidden\").\n\n\n\n"}

When performed as a spectacle, acrobatic tricks such as flips or skipping rope while in the air are often included.\n\nIt is thought that Yangban women developed \"Neolttwigi\" to see over the walls that surrounded their homes, as women in traditional Korea were rarely allowed out of their living compounds, except at night. According to the legend, a wife who wants to see a husband trapped in a prison over a high wall could see the face of a husband through Neolttwigi with a wife of another sinner.\n\nNeolttwigi also helped to alleviate the lack of exercise.\n\n"}
{"id": "1061985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1061985", "title": "Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)", "text": "Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)\n\nThe Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC, ) is the government agency in New Zealand that is responsible for classification of all films, videos, publications, and some video games in New Zealand. It was established under Section 76 of the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 (FVPC Act), replacing various film classification acts, including the Indecent Publications Tribunal. It is an independent Crown entity in terms of the Crown Entities Act 2004. The head of the OFLC is called the Chief Censor, maintaining a title that has described the government officer in charge of censorship in New Zealand since 1916.\n\nThe FVPC Act gives the OFLC jurisdiction to classify \"publications\" which include films, videos, DVDs, computer games with restricted content, books, magazines, comics, manga, sound recordings, pictures, newspapers, photographs, photographic slides, \"any print or writing\", any \"paper or other thing\" that has images or words on it (including apparel, playing cards, greeting cards, art, store-fronts and billboards), and electronic digital image, text and sound computer files. The OFLC also approves film posters and slicks. Only computer games with restricted content, and all films, videos, and DVDs, must carry a label before being offered for supply or exhibited to the public.\n\nAny person may submit any of the \"publications\" listed above for classification by the OFLC, with the permission of the Chief Censor. The Secretary for Internal Affairs, Comptroller of Customs, Commissioner of Police and the Film and Video Labelling Body may submit publications for classification without the Chief Censor's permission. The Courts have no jurisdiction to classify publications. If the classification of a publication becomes an issue in any civil or criminal proceeding, the Court must submit the publication to the OFLC. Any person who is dissatisfied with a decision of the OFLC may have the relevant publication, but not the OFLC decision, reviewed by the Film and Literature Board of Review.\n\nThe FVPC Act gives the OFLC the power to classify publications into three categories: unrestricted, restricted, and \"objectionable\" or banned. Unrestricted films are assigned a green or yellow rating label. Restricted films are assigned a red classification label.\n\nIn early 2013, some DVDs and Blu-rays released in New Zealand have had the rating label printed on the cover to prevent the removal of the labels, which is illegal.\n\nNew Zealand has used a colour-coded labelling system since 1987. The colors are intended to convey the messages conveyed by a traffic light: a green label means that nothing in the film, video or DVD should inhibit anyone viewing it; a yellow label means proceed with caution because the film, video or DVD may have content younger viewers should not see; and a red label means stop and ensure that no one outside of the restriction views the film, video, DVD or computer game. It is an offence to supply age-restricted material to anyone under the age shown on the label.\n\nThe New Zealand classification system currently uses the following labels:\nThe RP18 rating is the newest rating, having been created in April 2017 specifically for the drama series \"13 Reasons Why\".\n\nThe Film and Video Labelling Body may award films, videos and DVDs an unrestricted classification of (G, PG or M) based on their Australian classification, or British classification if no Australian classification exists. The OLFC is the only body who may award restricted ratings.\n\nRed labels have been available for non-film publications such as magazines and video games since 2005.\n\nThe OFLC classifies material based on whether it is likely to be \"harmful\" or \"injurious to the public good\". Specifically (from the FVPC Act): \"a publication is objectionable if it describes, depicts, expresses, or otherwise deals with matters such as sex, horror, crime, cruelty, or violence in such a manner that the availability of the publication is likely to be injurious to the public good.\" In 2000, the Court of Appeal of New Zealand decided in \"Living Word Distributors Limited v Human Rights Action Group (Wellington)\" [2000] NZCA 179 (a case involving two videos produced by Jeremiah Films) that the collocation of the words \"sex, horror, crime, cruelty or violence\" tends to point to activity rather than to the expression of opinion or attitude. On this interpretation, the OFLC had jurisdiction to restrict or ban publications describing or depicting sexual activities, but not those describing only an attitude or opinion about sex. The same interpretation required publications to describe or depict horror activities, criminal activities, cruel activities and violent activities, rather than just an opinion or attitude about those things, for the OFLC to be able to classify them.\n\nThe Court of Appeal explicitly ruled that the phrase \"matters such as sex\" is strongly indicative of sexual activities and does not include sexual orientation. This made it more difficult for the OFLC to restrict or ban, for example, publications that simply exploited the nudity of children or that portrayed classes of people as inherently inferior but that did not show any of the specified types of activity, notwithstanding the fact the FVPC Act directs the censors to give \"particular weight\" to these things when deciding whether or not to restrict or ban a publication. It also made it difficult for the OFLC to restrict publications simply containing offensive language or to ban videos of persons taken without their knowledge or consent, such as \"upskirt\" videos, on the ground of invasion of privacy, again because neither type of publication shows any of the specified types of activity. In 2005, Parliament amended the FVPC Act, and commenced amendment of the Crimes Act, to restore the OFLC's jurisdiction over all of these matters except for publications that simply portray classes of people as inherently inferior.\n\nUnder the FVPC Act, material that promotes, supports, or tends to promote or support the following is, by its nature, deemed objectionable (banned):\n\nThe Censorship Compliance Unit of the Department of Internal Affairs is responsible for the enforcement of the FVPC Act.\n\n\nThe Chief Censor is the Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the Office of Film and Literature Classification.\n\nThe OFLC regularly conducts research into a variety of issues concerning media regulation.\n\nThe OFLC also regularly convenes panels that are demographically representative of New Zealand as a whole to assist it with the classification of particular publications. It has convened public panels to assist it with the classification of films such as \"Baise-moi\", \"Salo\", \"Monster's Ball\", \"Irréversible\", \"Silent Hill\", \"Du er ikke alene\", \"Lolita\", \"8MM\" and \"Hannibal\". More frequently, the OFLC consults experts to assist it with the classification of various publications. For example, religious experts were consulted to assist with the classification of \"The Passion of the Christ\", experts in road safety were consulted on \"Mischief Destroy\", the Children's Commissioner on \"Ken Park\" and \"The Aristocrats\", homeopathic practitioners on drug manufacturing books written by Steve Preisler , various human rights organisations and the Vicar of Gisborne on a publication entitled \"Against Homosexuality\", and rape crisis centres and psychologists on \"Irréversible\" and an edition of the University of Otago student magazine \"Critic\".\n\nEach year, the OFLC consults media studies students in its high school programme called \"Censor for a Day\" during which an unreleased film is shown to high school students who are then asked to classify it applying the criteria in the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993. The students' classification is compared with, and usually identical to, the film's actual classification. Films used for \"Censor for a Day\" have included \"There's Something About Mary\", \"American Pie\", \"Road Trip\", \"Final Destination 3\", \"V for Vendetta\", \"Thirteen\", \"Crazy/Beautiful\", \"Garage Days\", \"The Notorious Bettie Page\", \"Atonement\", \"Charlie Bartlett\", \"Defiance\", \"Jennifer's Body\", \"Daybreakers\", \"Animal Kingdom\", \"Tucker & Dale vs. Evil\", \"Attack the Block\", \"Trance\", \"The East\", \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" and \"Housebound\".\n\nIn June 2007, Exit International Director Dr Philip Nitschke described the decision by the Classification Office banning \"The Peaceful Pill Handbook\" as \"very disappointing\" while recognising \"that the Censor was under intense political pressure over this decision\". The book was banned because it promotes and encourages criminal activity by offering instruction in how to smuggle and manufacture controlled drugs in violation of a number of statutes, not because it advocates reform of the law to permit the seriously ill and elderly access to pentobarbital.\n\nThe Society for the Promotion of Community Standards (SPCS) has repeatedly criticised the OFLC for not banning films such as \"Baise-moi\", \"Irréversible\", Takashi Miike's \"Visitor Q\" and \"Lies\" which it as described as highly pornographic and violent. The SPCS has also targeted films scheduled for exhibition in the Beck's Incredible Film Festival and the New Zealand International Film Festivals.\n\nIn 2006 the SPCS criticised the financial management of the OFLC, complaining to the Auditor General that the OFLC was inefficient and mismanaged taxpayer funds. The Auditor General conducted an audit of the OFLC and stated that \"no evidence of waste was found during the course of the audit\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "238198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238198", "title": "Rhoda", "text": "Rhoda\n\nRhoda is an American sitcom starring Valerie Harper which aired a total of 109 half-hour episodes and one hour-long episode over five seasons from September 9, 1974 to December 9, 1978. The series was a spin-off of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", in which Harper between the years 1970 and 1974 had played the role of Rhoda Morgenstern, a spunky, weight-conscious, flamboyantly fashioned Jewish neighbor and native New Yorker in the role of Mary Richards' best friend. After four seasons, Rhoda left Minneapolis and returned to her original hometown of New York City. The series was the winner of two Golden Globe Awards and two Emmy Awards.\n\n\"Rhoda\" was filmed Friday evenings in front of a live studio audience at CBS Studio Center, Stage 14 in Studio City, Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe series opens with the pilot episode featuring Rhoda Morgenstern traveling from her home in Minneapolis to New York City, where she was born and raised, for a two-week vacation, staying with her younger sister, Brenda (Julie Kavner). While there, she meets Joe Gerard (David Groh), a handsome divorcé who owns a wrecking company and has a ten-year-old son, Donny, whom Brenda babysits. Following Brenda's prompting, Rhoda and Joe meet and develop an instant attraction to each other which leads to their dating nightly for the duration of her vacation. After an argument about their feelings for each other, Joe asks Rhoda to stay in New York City, which she does, initially moving in with Brenda at 332 E. 64th Street (however, actual exterior shots are of 332 East 84th Street, between 1st and 2nd Avenues on the southeast end of the block). Brenda, a bank teller, is an insecure person with low self-esteem with dating problems, similar to how Rhoda herself had experienced difficulty in dating in Minneapolis in the early years of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\".\n\nThe first episode of Season 1, entitled \"Joe\", aired on CBS on Monday, September 9, 1974 at 9:30 PM. and immediately set a record by being the first and only television series ever to achieve a number-one Nielsen rating for its premiere pilot episode, defeating the ABC ratings juggernaut, \"Monday Night Football\" in the process. This record continues to stand after over 40 years.\n\nRhoda and Brenda soon realize that the small studio apartment can't hold them both, so Rhoda moves in with their parents Ida (Nancy Walker) and Martin (Harold Gould) at their apartment in the Bronx. Ida and Martin are the stereotypical Jewish parents. Ida is overbearing, overprotective, benevolently manipulative, and desperate to ensure her daughters find a good husband. Martin is her dutiful, mild-mannered husband. Ida initially goes to great lengths to baby her daughter. When it becomes apparent Rhoda is sliding into a rut by occupying her childhood bedroom, Ida forces her to move out for her own good.\n\nAs the weeks go by, the relationship between Joe and Rhoda quickly blossoms. By the sixth episode, \"Pop Goes the Question\", an insecure Rhoda asks Joe where their relationship is heading. His response is to invite Rhoda to move in with him. After some careful thought, and consultation with her sister and father, Rhoda accepts Joe's invitation, but within minutes of moving in decides that rather than living together out of wedlock she prefers to be married. Rhoda attempts to convince Joe that they are very compatible and would be a happily married couple. After some hesitation, Joe agrees and a wedding is planned.\n\nEight weeks into the series on Monday, October 28, 1974, Rhoda and Joe were married in a special hour-long episode which broke several television records. Heavily publicized, it became the highest-rated television episode of the 1970s, a record it held until the miniseries \"Roots\" claimed that title in 1977. Additionally, on the night of its airing it had become the second most-watched television episode of all time, surpassed only by the birth of Little Ricky on \"I Love Lucy\" in 1953.\n\nIt was watched by more than 52 million Americans, over half of the US viewing audience. At the conclusion of the episode, Monday Night Football host Howard Cosell joked on the air that he had not been invited to the wedding, and welcomed viewers back to the game. Hundreds of \"wedding parties\" were held by fans across the United States on the night of the episode to celebrate the television wedding, and within days the CBS-TV studios were inundated with wedding gifts sent in by fans for the fictional Joe and Rhoda Gerard. The episode was overwhelmingly praised by critics, widely touted as a \"television phenomenon\", \"unlike anything that had happened on television for nearly twenty years\", and garnered Harper her fourth Emmy award in 1975. \"Vogue\" magazine reported that people across the country had pulled off the road checking into motels, and friends canceled out on dinner invitations (feigning illness), just to watch Rhoda's wedding.\n\nThe wedding episode featured guest appearances by many of the main characters from \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", including Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore), Lou Grant (Edward Asner), Murray Slaughter (Gavin MacLeod), Georgette Franklin (Georgia Engel), and Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman). The only major characters who didn't attend were Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) and Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White).\n\nIn \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" episode \"The New Sue Ann\", airing Saturday, October 26, 1974, two days before \"Rhoda's Wedding\", the characters frequently discuss the upcoming event and buy wedding gifts. At the end of the episode Murray and Lou leave the TV station to drive Mary to the airport. During \"Rhoda's Wedding\" it is revealed that on a lark Lou and Murray decided to fly to New York with Mary to surprise Rhoda; her frequent nemesis, Phyllis, who intentionally not been invited, nonetheless flew in for the wedding, and Mary and Rhoda's friend, Georgette, who drove from Minneapolis.\n\nDuring the episode, Phyllis asks for the opportunity to participate in the wedding and is appointed the responsibility to pick up Rhoda at Brenda's Manhattan apartment and drive her to her parents' apartment in the Bronx where the ceremony is being held. The self-absorbed and forgetful Phyllis neglects to keep her promise. This forces Rhoda to take the subway, running through the streets of Manhattan and the Bronx fully regaled in her wedding dress and veil and dashing into her parents' apartment building in one of the most memorable moments in the history of series television.\n\nIn a state of shock, Ida refuses Phyllis's profuse apologies saying \"I'll kill you\". Phyllis begs everyone in the room to forgive her, but the only one who does is Georgette, who then suggests to Phyllis that she leave before Rhoda arrives. The episode also features special closing credits, showing additional footage of Rhoda (Harper) running down a Manhattan street in her wedding dress and veil accompanied by an alternative version of the theme song played to the tune of Mendelssohn's \"Wedding March\".\n\nFor the remainder of the first and second seasons, the show focuses on Rhoda and Joe's new married life. The two move into a penthouse suite in the same building as Brenda. Rhoda advances in her career as a window dresser by opening up a small window dressing business called \"Windows by Rhoda\" with her old high school friend Myrna Morgenstein (Barbara Sharma). Rhoda uses her own maiden surname \"Morgenstern\" in her professional dealings as a window dresser and her married surname \"Gerard\" in her personal life.\n\nDuring this period, the show was a massive ratings hit on Monday nights, staying near the top of the ratings in both seasons, even faring better than its parent, \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\". In early seasons, the closing credits of the series featured Rhoda on a New York street trying to imitate Mary Tyler Moore's trademark hat toss, but the cap slips from Rhoda's hand before she can throw it. Upon moving from \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" to her own eponymous series, Rhoda's Jewish religious and ethnic background seemed to fade as she was no longer unique and would be surrounded by a host of New York ethnics.\n\nThroughout the tenure of Rhoda Morgenstern's character being featured on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", her “Jewish-ness” was discussed on several episodes. Such episodes included: \"Some of My Best Friends are Rhoda\" from which the subject of anti-Semitism was covered; “Enter Rhoda’s Parents” from which Rhoda’s parents renewed their wedding vows by a rabbi; and \"A Girl's Best Mother Is Not Her Friend\", in which Ida wanted to fix Mary up with an eligible bachelor, a man whom she'd deemed inappropriate for Rhoda, as he wasn't Jewish. This candid expression of “Jewish-ness” changed however when \"Rhoda\" was spun off in 1974. During the first season of \"Rhoda\", the representation of Rhoda Morgenstern altered from her parent show to fit a more mainstream audience: she was trimmer, more confident, and less “Jewish”. Throughout the first season, there were scant references about Rhoda's “Jewish-ness”.\n\nMoreover, there was even a Christmas episode with no mention of the character’s Jewish background entitled, \"Guess What I Got You for the Holidays\". Thus, the creation of Rhoda’s own series stifled the representation of “Jewish-ness” – as Charlotte Brown, the executive producer of \"Rhoda\", conveyed in an interview the display of “Jewish-ness”, “was just ‘set dressing’ – Ida’s brisket, her plastic on the furniture\". Ironically, although Harper and Walker achieved great popularity playing characters of the Jewish faith, in real life, neither actress was Jewish.\n\nIn the first episode of the third season during a particularly dramatic scene Joe leaves Rhoda and the two remain separated for the entire season, with Groh appearing in only nine of the season's episodes. A few weeks later, they mutually agree to see a marriage counselor where Joe reveals to a stunned Rhoda that he had never wanted to be married, and that he married her only because she had pressured him into it after he had invited her to live with him.\n\nAudiences were equally stunned and deserted the program in droves. Although the producers believed the plot development was essential, the fan response to Rhoda and Joe's separation was overwhelmingly negative and hostile. CBS was inundated with thousands of angry letters protesting the plot development, \"Rhoda\" and \"Joe\" received sympathy cards and letters of condolence, with Groh later reporting that he had received hate mail for as much as a year after the season had ended. This sentiment would translate into a steep ratings decline during the course of the season and the show ranked #32 for the 1976–77 season (falling from #7 the year before). Though Ida appears in the opening episode (\"The Separation\"), both she and Martin are absent for the remainder of the season, explained as traveling across the country in an RV. (At this time, Nancy Walker departed the program to headline two short-lived ABC series: \"The Nancy Walker Show\", and \"Blansky's Beauties\"; and Harold Gould left to star in his own show, \"The Feather and Father Gang\" on ABC.) To help fill in the void left by Walker and Gould, the producers hired comedian Anne Meara as Rhoda's new friend, Sally Gallagher, a middle-aged divorcee who makes her living as an airline stewardess. Meara did not catch on with viewers and her character lasted only one season.\n\nWith Rhoda and Joe now separated, they soon move out of their apartment. Joe moves to another building while Rhoda trades apartments with downstairs neighbor Gary Levy (Ron Silver), a jean-store owner who soon strikes up a platonic friendship with Rhoda. Stories initially center on Rhoda and Joe's attempts to work through their differences. As the season progresses, however, Joe is seen less frequently and Rhoda begins dating other people. Ultimately, they never reconcile and Joe is never seen again after this season. Johnny Venture (Michael DeLano), a lounge singer, becomes a frequent suitor that Rhoda only barely tolerates. Meanwhile, Brenda, no longer overweight but still with self-esteem problems, finally finds a boyfriend in professional roller-skater and toll-booth worker Benny Goodwin (Ray Buktenica), whose principal claim to fame is the similarity of his name to the famous musician Benny Goodman. She also occasionally dates neighbor Gary Levy as well as continuing her casual relationship with immature accordion player Nick Lobo.\n\nFor the fourth season, Rhoda's divorce is finalized and she resumes use of her maiden name \"Morgenstern\" full-time (from this point on, her ex-husband, Joe Gerard, as well as Rhoda's friend from the previous season, Sally Gallagher, are never referred to nor are their names ever mentioned again). The show then centers on her role as a thirty-something divorcée, dating from time to time. Ida and Martin come home after a year's absence from their lengthy cross-country trip (in reality, both Nancy Walker's and Harold Gould's attempts at a new series the previous year had failed).\n\nBrenda continues to date Gary Levy and Benny Goodwin, one more than the other. Meanwhile, Rhoda's career is undergoing a transition. Seeking a career change, she finds a job at the Doyle Costume Company. There she works for the gruff Jack Doyle (Kenneth McMillan), a man with similarities to Lou Grant. Season 4 ranked higher than season 3 in the ratings (finishing at #25 for the year), but \"Rhoda\" never regained the popularity it had achieved during its first two seasons on television.\n\nIn September, 1978, the show underwent additional changes for the fifth and final season. Rhoda sported a new longer frizzy-permed hairstyle, which she kept pulled back in a small ponytail for most of the season. Ida and Martin go through a separation of their own; Martin then goes to Florida to find himself. He returns after several episodes but Ida wants to be wooed back, leading to dating and other romantic rituals between the two. Brenda and Benny get engaged to be married, with their wedding planned for later in the season (though this would ultimately not happen, due to \"Rhoda\"'s abrupt mid-season cancellation). Gary Levy does not return for this season; it is mentioned near the season's start episode 3 that he has moved to Chicago. A new co-worker, Tina Molinari (Nancy Lane), joins Rhoda and Jack at the costume shop, having appeared in several season 4 episodes as an employee at Gary's jeans store.\n\nAt this time, the series, along with the Norman Lear sitcom \"Good Times\", was moved to Saturday nights, with \"Rhoda\" airing at 8:00 P.M. and \"Good Times\" being shown at 8:30 P.M. Competing against NBC's popular police series \"CHiPs\", the ratings for both programs declined drastically. \"Rhoda\" was canceled by CBS in December 1978—midway through its fifth season—with four episodes remaining unaired, though these episodes later aired in syndication. It ended its final year ranking at #95 out of 114 shows. \"Good Times\" was pulled from the CBS schedule in December and returned in the spring of 1979 on Wednesday nights at 8:30 P.M. It finished out its sixth season, but its ratings did not improve, with the show ranked at #94. Within a few months, it, too, was canceled by CBS.\n\n\n\nThe following are well-known actors who feature in guest-starring roles on \"Rhoda\": Henry Winkler, Vivian Vance, Eileen Heckart, John Ritter, Norman Fell, Doris Roberts, Joan Van Ark, Tim Matheson, Linda Lavin, Judd Hirsch, Ruth Gordon, Howard Hesseman, Anne Jackson, Robert Alda, David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Stiller, Jack Gilford, René Auberjonois.\n\nEmmy Awards:\n\n\nGolden Globe Awards:\n\n\nCollectively, \"Rhoda\" garnered a total of 17 Emmy nominations and 7 Golden Globe nominations.\n\n\n\nAn animated TV pilot titled \"Carlton Your Doorman\", a proposed spin-off of the Carlton, the doorman character (voiced by Lorenzo Music), was broadcast May 21, 1980 on CBS. Although the episode won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, it was never picked up by the network as a series.\n\nDespite never having reunited in-character on a TV special or movie, some of the cast members of \"Rhoda\" have gotten together over the years on the following daytime talk-shows:\n\n\nOn April 21, 2009, Shout! Factory released the first season of \"Rhoda\" on DVD in Region 1, which was the year of the show's 35th anniversary. The release also includes a \"Remembering Rhoda\" featurette, as well as the original one-hour version of \"Rhoda's Wedding\", as opposed to the two-part edited version that aired in syndication. 15 of the season's 24 episodes are the edited-for-syndication versions taken from poor quality masters, while the other 9 episodes (including the Wedding episode) are the unedited network versions. A review on DVDTalk also states some of the edited episodes being time compressed. Because the series premiere in the DVD set is the syndicated version, Mary Tyler Moore's appearance at the beginning of the episode is not included. However, the full version of the pilot can be viewed at The Paley Center for Media in New York and Los Angeles. Footage from the missing scene is even included in the end credits to the series premiere.\n\nSeason two and Season three episodes were released unedited.\nSeason four was released on September 21, 2010, as a Shout! Factory select title, available exclusively through their online store.\n\nSeason 4 was re-released as a general retail release on August 15, 2017.\n\nSeason five was released by Shout!

All episodes from that season are there, except for \"The Honeymoon\", due to legal issues. While the versions of the episodes are, for the most part, the same as the versions on the DVD, there are a few minor differences:\n\nIn Canada, \"Rhoda\" started airing on Comedy Gold on February 28, 2011.\n\nOn July 8, 2013 \"Rhoda\" began airing on Me-TV at 9:30PM Eastern Time.\n\nIn 1996, Nick at Nite began airing reruns of \"Rhoda\".

Most often seen in traditional circuses, the ringmaster is a master of ceremonies that introduces the circus acts to the audience.\n\nA ringmaster introduces the various acts in a circus show and guides the audience through the experience, directing their attention to the various areas of the circus arena and helping to link the acts together while equipment is brought into and removed from the circus ring. A ringmaster may interact with some acts, especially the clown acts, to make the various acts part of a seamless circus performance. Ringmasters have become an integral part of the many circus shows and sometimes will be involved in elements of some of the acts performances. \n\nIt is traditionally the ringmaster's job to use hyperbole whenever possible while introducing the acts to enhance the expectations of the audience. Declarations of the \"biggest\", \"most dangerous\", \"amazing\", \"spectacular\" and similar expressions are common.\n\nA ringmaster is traditionally attired in a bright tailcoat, often red with gold trim and with a top hat. The outfit is designed to look like an 18th-century gentleman's riding habit, and often includes a whip, a relic of when the ringmaster directed the performance, not as an announcer and host but as director of the many equestrian acts. It is generally accepted that this costume was first adopted by George Claude Lockhart on the orders of Bertram Mills in 1928, when Lockhart worked as ringmaster for his circus at Olympia, London. A female circus leader is known as a ringmistress, and often wears a red skirt and knee-high black boots, and either the same topcoat and tails as a ringmaster or a blouse.\n\nIn non-English speaking countries the ring master is known by different titles. In France he is called \"Monsieur Loyal\" after the Anselme-Pierre Loyal (1753-1826), one of the first renowned circus personalities.\n\n\n3. The Greatest Showman\n"}

{"id": "22197912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22197912", "title": "Simpleton", "text": "Simpleton\n\nIn folklore, a simpleton is a person whose foolish actions are the subject of often-repeated stories. Simpletons are also known as noodles, fools, and gothamites. Folklore often holds, with no basis in fact, that certain towns or countries are thought to be home to large numbers of simpletons. The ancient Greeks told tales of stupid populations in Abdera and other cities; in Germany, men of Schilda are conspicuous in these stories; in Spain hundreds of jokes exist about the supposed foolishness of the people from Lepe; and in England, the village of Gotham in Nottinghamshire is reputed to be populated by simpletons. In Sri Lanka whole districts in the central, southern, and western provinces are credited with being the abode of foolish people. \n\nTales of simpleton behavior have often been collected into books, and early joke books include many simpleton jokes. In ancient Greece, Hierokles created such a collection. In England, the famous \"Joe Miller's Jests\" is highly inclusive of simpleton jokes. In Britain the Irish are often stereotyped as stupid and are the butt of An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman jokes. Books of simpleton tales exist in Persia, Ireland, Turkey, Iceland, Japan, Sicily, and India. \n\nSimpleton tales are huge in number, but many of them share the same notions of simple-minded behavior. Many are repeated, with altered names, settings, characters, etc., in language after language and collection after collection. \n\nA very old such tale from England isThere was a man of Gotham that rode to the market with two bushels of wheat, and because his horse should not be damaged by carrying too great a burden, he was determined to carry the corn himself upon his own neck, and still kept riding upon his horse till he arrived at the end of his journey. Now I will leave you to judge which was the wisest, his horse or himself.\n\nA famous one from ancient Greece isA man's father having died, the son dutifully took the body to the embalmers. When he returned at the appointed time to take it, there happened to be a number of bodies in the same place, so he was asked if his father had any peculiarity by which his body might be recognised, and the simpleton replied, \"He had a cough.\"\n\nMythra (A character from Xenoblade Chronicles 2)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2797313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2797313", "title": "Theatre of Japan", "text": "Theatre of Japan\n\nTraditional Japanese theatre includes Kabuki, Noh (and its comic accompaniment, Kyōgen) and the puppet theatre, Bunraku.\n\nThe early existing Kyogen scripts date from the 15th century. Kyogen was used as an intermission between Noh acts—it linked the theme of the Noh play with the modern world by means of farce and slapstick. Noh played to the high level class, but there were occasions where Noh was performed for common audiences. Unlike Noh, the performers of Kyogen do not wear masks, unless their role calls for physical transformation. Although they were both very popular forms of theatre, commoners were often in higher attendance for Kyogen performances.\n\nBoth men and women were allowed to perform Kyogen until 1430.\n\nThe best known form of Japanese theatre is Kabuki. It combines music, drama, and dance. Its fame comes from the wild costumes and sword fights employed in this form (until the 1680s, real swords were used). Kabuki grew out of opposition to Noh — dramatists wanted to shock the audience with more lively and timely stories. It is told to have been first performed by Okunis in 1603. Like Noh, however, Kabuki also became a stylized, regimented art form and is still performed in the same fashion.\n\nAs a matter of interest, the popular Gekidan Shinkansen, a theatrical troupe based in Tokyo today, insists it follows pure kabuki tradition by performing historical roles in a modern, noisy, and outlandish way characteristic of this theatrical method. Whether or not they represent traditional kabuki, however, remains a matter of debate and personal opinion.\n\nPuppets and Bunraku were used in Japanese theatre as early as the Noh plays. Medieval records prove the use of puppets actually in Noh plays. The puppets were 3- to 4-foot-tall () dolls manipulated by puppeteers in full view of the audience. The puppeteers controlling the legs and hands are dressed entirely in black, while the head puppeteer is wearing colorful clothing. Music and chanting is a popular convention of bunraku, and the shamisen player is usually considered to be the leader of the production as well as the one with the shortest hair.\n\nJapanese modern drama in the early 20th century, the 1900s, consisted of Shingeki (experimental Western-style theatre), which employed naturalistic acting and contemporary themes in contrast to the stylized conventions of Kabuki and Noh. Hōgetsu Shimamura and Kaoru Osanai were two figures influential in the development of shingeki.\n\nIn the postwar period, there was a phenomenal growth in creative new dramatic works, which introduced fresh aesthetic concepts that revolutionized the orthodox modern theatre. Challenging the realistic, psychological drama focused on \"tragic historical progress\" of the Western-derived shingeki, young playwrights broke with such accepted tenets as conventional stage space, placing their action in tents, streets, and open areas and, at the extreme, in scenes played out all over Tokyo.\n\nPlots became increasingly complex, with play-within-a-play sequences, moving rapidly back and forth in time, and intermingling reality with fantasy. Dramatic structure was fragmented, with the focus on the performer, who often used a variety of masks to reflect different personae.\n\nPlaywrights returned to common stage devices perfected in Noh and Kabuki to project their ideas, such as employing a narrator, who could also use English for international audiences. Major playwrights in the 1980s were Kara Juro, Shimizu Kunio, and Betsuyaku Minoru, all closely connected to specific companies. In contrast, the fiercely independent Murai Shimako won awards throughout the world for her numerous works focusing on the Hiroshima bombing, which were frequently performed by only one or two actresses. In the 1980s, stagecraft was refined into a more sophisticated, complex format than in the earlier postwar experiments but lacked their bold critical spirit.\n\nTadashi Suzuki developed a unique method of performer training which integrated avant-garde concepts with classical Noh and Kabuki devices, an approach that became a major creative force in Japanese and international theatre in the 1980s. Another highly original East-West fusion occurred in the inspired production Nastasya, taken from Dostoevsky's \"The Idiot\", in which Bando Tamasaburo, a famed Kabuki onnagata (female impersonator), played the roles of both the prince and his fiancée.\n\nThe 1980s also encouraged the creation of the Sho-Gekijo, literally \"little theatre\". This usually meant amateur theatrical troupes making plays designed to be seen by anyone and everyone — not necessarily as meaningful in nature as they were simply entertaining. Some of the more philosophical playwrights and directors of that time are Noda Hideki and Shōji Kōkami.\n\nPopular sho-gekijo theatrical troupes include Nylon 100, Gekidan Shinkansen, Tokyo Sunshine Boys, and Halaholo Shangrila.\n\nRecently, new generation of Sho-Gekijo artists who are labeled as the \"Generation of the Lost Decade\" or the \"Generation of 2000s\" are emerging. Principal artists among this generation are: Toshiki Okada, Shiro Maeda, Kuro Tanino, Daisuke Miura, Tomohiro Maekawa and so on.\n\nMany Western plays, from those of the Ancient Greek theatre to William Shakespeare and from those of Fyodor Dostoevsky to Samuel Beckett, are performed in Tokyo. A large number of performances, perhaps as many as 3,000, are given each year, making Tokyo one of the world's leading theatrical centers.\n\nThe opening of the replica of the Globe Theatre was celebrated by importing an entire British company to perform all of Shakespeare's historical plays, while other Tokyo theatres produced other Shakespearean plays including various new interpretations of \"Hamlet\" and \"King Lear\". The Globe Theatre, located in Shin-Ōkubo in Tokyo, now belongs mostly to Johnny's Entertainment and the promotion of pop idols in the acting field.\n\nYukio Ninagawa is an internationally known Japanese director and playwright who often turns to elements of Shakespeare for inspiration. In 1995 he performed the \"Shakespeare Tenpo 12Nen\", an interpretation of the wildly popular British theatre \"Shakespeare Condensed\": all of Shakespeare's plays in two hours. Famous actors such as Natsuki Mari and Karawa Toshiaki were involved.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "927060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=927060", "title": "Twenty-One (game show)", "text": "Twenty-One (game show)\n\nTwenty-One is an American game show originally hosted by Jack Barry which aired on NBC from 1956 to 1958. Produced by Jack Barry-Dan Enright Productions, the program became notorious for being a rigged quiz show which nearly caused the demise of the entire genre in the wake of United States Senate investigations. The 1994 movie \"Quiz Show\" is based on these events. A new version aired in 2000 with Maury Povich hosting, lasting about four months, again on NBC.\n\nTwo contestants, typically a returning champion and a challenger, entered separate isolation booths and donned pairs of headphones. Due to the arrangement of the booths and the studio lighting, the contestants could not see or hear each other or the audience. At any given moment during the game, one booth would be \"open,\" meaning that the occupant could hear the host in the headphones and be heard by him through the booth's microphone. The other booth would be \"closed,\" with its microphone disabled and the headphones playing music so that the occupant could not hear the game.\n\nThe game was played in rounds, with Barry announcing the category for each round as it was dispensed from a machine on his podium; there were over 100 possible categories. The challenger played first in each round, with their booth open and the champion's closed, and selected the point value (1 to 11) they wanted to attempt. Higher-value questions were more difficult, and questions often had several parts. If the challenger answered correctly, the points were added to their score; a miss subtracted the points, but the score could never go below zero. The challenger's booth was then closed and the champion's opened so they could take a turn. Barry did not tell either contestant about the other's score or performance.\n\nThe goal was to earn a total of 21 points. If the challenger reached this score first, their booth was left open to hear the champion's turn, but they were cautioned not to speak or give away any information. Barry did not tell the champion that the challenger had already reached 21 unless the champion asked for a question that would give him or her 21 points if answered correctly. If the champion failed to match that score, the challenger won. The champion won by reaching 21 first on their own turn. If a round ended in a 21–21 tie, the scores were erased and a new game was played. Contestants were given extra time to think on any question that would bring them up to 21.\n\nAfter two rounds, both booths were opened and the contestants were given a chance to stop the game. If either of them asked to do so, the contestant in the lead was declared the winner. The game was automatically stopped after five rounds.\n\nThe winner of the game received $500 per point in the margin of victory (e.g., a 21–15 win paid $3,000). Whenever a game ended in a tie, the stakes were raised by $500 per point and a new game was played. If the champion won, they could choose to leave the show with all winnings intact or play again, basing this decision on a small amount of information about the next challenger. However, if the challenger won, their winnings for that game were paid out of the defeated champion's total.\n\nQuestions were still worth 1 to 11 points, but all main-game questions were multiple-choice, with no \"multiple-part\" questions. Questions worth 6 or fewer points had one correct answer out of three choices. Questions worth 7 to 10 points had one correct answer out of four choices; for 10-point questions, \"None of the above\" was an option. Questions worth 11 points had \"two\" correct answers out of five, and both were required.\n\nIncorrect answers no longer deducted points from a contestant's score. Instead, contestants received a strike for each incorrect response; accumulating three strikes resulted in an automatic loss. This rule change meant that games could end without a winner, as the rounds again were played to completion. If one contestant had struck out on their turn and the second contestant had two strikes, they could also lose the game on an incorrect answer. However, a contestant did not know how their opponent had struck out unless explicitly told by the host.\n\nEach contestant could call for a \"Second Chance\" once per game, allowing an opportunity to receive help from a friend or family member before answering. An incorrect response on a Second Chance penalized the contestant with two strikes instead of one. If the challenger struck out, and the champion had either one or two strikes and had not yet used their Second Chance, the round was played to completion since they could still strike out.\n\nGames were still played to a maximum of five rounds, and beginning with the second episode, contestants had the option to stop the game after the second round if neither had reached 21. If time ran out during a game and at least two complete rounds had been played, the contestant in the lead was declared the winner and advanced to the Perfect 21 bonus round at the beginning of the next episode.\n\nUnlike the 1950s version, if the game ended in a tie, no new game was played. Instead, the contestants would be asked one question, and the first contestant to ring-in got to answer. If right, he or she won the game and went on to play the bonus round; an incorrect answer gave the opponent a chance to respond. If both contestants missed the question, a new one was asked.\n\nLosing challengers received $1,000 as a consolation prize. Rather than receiving a dollar value multiplied by the point difference after winning each game, champions received progressively larger amounts for each opponent defeated. Originally, the payoff structure was as follows:\nThese amounts accumulated, so winning four games would be worth $1,000,000. After winning a fourth game, the contestant started the chain again at $100,000 for defeating a fifth opponent, $200,000 for defeating a sixth, and so on.\n\nAfter a few early episodes, the prize ladder changed to the following:\nThese amounts accumulated, so winning seven games would be worth at least $2,675,000. As before, any contestant who defeated a seventh opponent started from the beginning of the chain.\n\nWhen the rules changed, the returning champion had won one game and $100,000 in his appearance on the final show under the old prize structure. Instead of being \"grandfathered\" under the old prize structure, he played and won his second game for $250,000 (the next amount after $100,000), and played but lost his third game for $500,000.\n\nUnder both prize structures, champions remained on the show until being defeated, and new champions' winnings were not deducted from the totals of dethroned ones.\n\nDuring the first six episodes, the audience chose the winner's next opponent. The audience would be presented with two potential challengers to face the current champion, and the audience would vote for an opponent using keypads. The person who received the higher vote played against the champion; the other person would be one of the two potential challengers to be voted on for the next game. In the first episode, there were three potential opponents to face the champion. After the sixth episode, the process was changed to a random selection. At the beginning of the show, six potential challengers would be introduced, and would be selected randomly from that group for each new game. People who had not been selected by the end of the show were not guaranteed to return on the following show, although some people did appear on the show multiple times before being selected to play.\n\nThe champion was asked a maximum of six true/false questions in a single category, starting at one point and increasing by one per question to a maximum value of six. After any correct answer, the champion could stop playing and receive $10,000 per point; an incorrect answer ended the round and forfeited this money. Correctly answering all six questions won the top prize of $210,000.\n\nUnder the first payoff structure, Rahim Oberholtzer was the biggest winner, collecting $1,120,000 (at the time, the all-time game show winnings record) over four victories, three of which were due to his opponents striking out.\n\nDavid Legler won $1,765,000 over six wins with the new payout structure. Legler was the top winner of American game shows until 2001 and is now the seventh-highest winner from an American television game show.\n\n\"Twenty-One\" was originally conceived by host Jack Barry and producing partner Dan Enright as a weekly half-hour program for CBS' 1956–1957 schedule. The show was ultimately picked up by NBC, and ran from September 12, 1956 to October 17, 1958, under the sponsorship of Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the makers of Geritol. The series finished at #21 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1957–1958 season.\n\nJim Lange hosted a pilot for an abandoned syndicated revival of the show in 1982.\n\nNBC revived the show in 2000 with Maury Povich as host, after ABC's \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", FOX's \"Greed\", and CBS' \"Winning Lines\" proved big-money game shows had once again become viable prime-time network fare. NBC aired first-run episodes through the end of May sweeps, after which the network declined to renew the series. Several unaired episodes aired on PAX TV in the summer of 2000.\n\nThe initial broadcast of \"Twenty-One\" was played honestly, with no manipulation of the game by the producers. That broadcast was, in the words of producer Dan Enright, \"a dismal failure\"; the first two contestants succeeded only in making a mockery of the format by showing how little they really knew. Show sponsor Geritol, upon seeing this opening-night performance, reportedly became furious with the results, and said in no uncertain terms that they did not want to see a repeat performance.\n\nThe end result: \"Twenty-One\" was not merely \"fixed\", it was almost completely choreographed. Contestants were cast almost as if they were actors, and in fact were active and (usually) willing partners in the deception. They were given instruction as to how to dress, what to say to the host, when to say it, what questions to answer, what questions to miss, even when to mop their brows in their isolation booths (which had air conditioning that could be cut off at will, to make them sweat more).\n\nCharles Van Doren, a college professor, was introduced as a contestant on \"Twenty-One\" on November 28, 1956, as a challenger to then-champion Herbert Stempel, a dominant contestant, though somewhat unpopular with viewers and eventually the sponsor. Van Doren and Stempel ultimately played to a series of four 21–21 games, with audience interest building with each passing week and each new game, until finally the clean-cut, \"All American Boy\" newcomer was able to outlast his bookish, quasi-intellectual opponent, who at one point after the game was referred to backstage as a \"freak with a sponge memory\". The film \"Quiz Show\" depicts the turning point as coming on a question directed to Stempel: \"What motion picture won the Academy Award [for Best Motion Picture] for 1955?\" Stempel legitimately knew the answer to that question was \"Marty\", as it was one of his favorite films. The producers ordered him to answer the question with 1954's Best Motion Picture winner, \"On the Waterfront\".\nStempel later recalled that there was a moment in the booth when his conscience and sense of fair play warred with his sense of obligation and that he almost disrupted the scripted outcome by giving the correct answer. Stempel answered incorrectly as he was instructed, but redeemed himself by staying in the game and earning enough points to tie Van Doren's score, unlike the depiction of events in \"Quiz Show\". Stempel was finally defeated in the next game, with Van Doren leading: the surviving kinescope of the broadcast shows Stempel failing to come up with the title of William Allen White's August 15, 1896, editorial in the \"Emporia Gazette\", \"What's the Matter with Kansas?\" After the missed question, Van Doren quit with 18 points, which was enough to win. Van Doren's victory began one of the longest and most storied runs of any champion in the history of television game shows. Van Doren's popularity soared as a result of his success on \"Twenty-One\", earning him a place on the cover of \"Time\" magazine and even a regular feature spot on NBC's \"Today\" show; at one point, the program even surpassed CBS' \"I Love Lucy\" in the ratings. He was finally unseated as champion by Vivienne Wax Nearing (1926–2007) on March 11, 1957, after winning a total of $129,000 (the equivalent of $ today).\n\nIn the meantime Stempel, disgruntled over being ordered to \"take a dive\", attempted to blow the whistle on what exactly was going on behind the scenes at \"Twenty-One\", even going so far as to have a federal investigator look into the show. Initially, little came of these investigations and Stempel's accusations were dismissed as jealousy because there was no hard evidence to back up his claims. While a congressional investigation did affect \"Twenty-One\" during this period, the investigation in question was the HUAC hearings into possible Communists in entertainment; the show's director, Charles S. Dubin, was fired by NBC in June 1958, after he refused to answer whether he ever had been part of the Communist party.\n\nIn August 1958 \"Dotto\", a popular CBS daytime game show, was abruptly canceled after a contestant found a notebook containing the answers to every question that was to be asked to the show's current champion, future journalist Marie Winn. Stempel's allegations about \"Twenty-One\" began to gain credibility. A grand jury was convened in Autumn 1958 to investigate \"Dotto\" and other possible game show fixing, investigated by Joseph Stone, assistant New York district attorney. Stone says in his book \"Prime Time and Misdemeanors\" that question writer Glorianne Rader was instructed by Dan Enright and associate producer Al Freedman, who had chosen the categories for the next broadcast earlier in the week, to place them in Barry's dispensing machine a few minutes before airtime; this was done to avoid any slipups in the planned outcome. Stone reached out to former contestants of \"Twenty-One\", including one Richard Jackman. Jackman, asked by Enright if he would tell the truth if approached by Stone, said that he would confess to the fixing of \"Twenty-One\". Three days after Jackman confessed to Stone, and without advance public warning, \"Twenty-One\" was canceled after its broadcast of October 17, 1958, amid plummeting ratings. A nighttime version of \"Concentration\" took over its time slot the following week.\n\nFurther eroding Barry and Enright's claims of honesty, another former contestant, James Snodgrass, came forward with corroborating proof the show was rigged: in a series of registered letters he had mailed to himself, Snodgrass documented each and every answer he was coached on prior to air time and testified to the fact in front of Congress in 1959.\n\nThe scandal forced producers Barry and Enright into virtual exile. Barry would not host another national TV show for more than a decade, and Enright moved to Canada to continue his production career.\n\nThe scandal also caused the Federal Communications Commission to mandate the sale of Barry-Enright's radio station in Hollywood, Florida, WGMA (now WLQY). The station was purchased by its general manager, C. Edward Little, who promptly affiliated the station with the Mutual Broadcasting System. After serving for a time as the head of Mutual's affiliates association, Little became the president of Mutual from 1972–79. During this time Little created the Mutual Black Network, the first U.S. broadcast network catering exclusively to African-Americans, in addition to the Mutual Spanish Network and the Mutual Southwest Network. Under Little's administration, Mutual became the first commercial broadcasting entity to use satellite technology for program delivery. During his tenure as head of Mutual, Little hired Larry King to host an all-night phone-in talk show Little had created. King was a one-time announcer for Little at WGMA. King, who had previously hosted a similar morning show on Miami radio station WIOD, went on to national fame on both radio and television, winning a coveted Peabody Award along the way.\n\nJack Barry finally returned to game show hosting in 1969, succeeding Dennis Wholey on ABC's \"The Generation Gap\" for which he publicly thanked the producers and ABC-TV for giving him a chance for a comeback. In 1971, he sold ABC his first new game show \"The Reel Game\" which he also hosted. It ran for 13 weeks. He became a success again as a producer-host with \"The Joker's Wild\", which ran on CBS from 1972–1975 and in syndication from 1977–1986 (Barry died in May 1984 and was replaced by Bill Cullen for the final two years). Enright would work as \"Joker\"s executive producer in the final year on CBS, and the two revived their partnership full-time in 1976, reviving \"Tic-Tac-Dough\" which also ran until 1986. It was revived once more in 1990, but was cancelled after a few months. Enright died in 1992.\n\nA pilot was made in 1982 with Jim Lange as host and Charlie O'Donnell announcing, but was not picked up. In this pilot, a bonus round was introduced; the bonus round consisted of a flashing randomizer showing numbers from 1 to 11. The contestant would decided whether he/she wanted the number, or wanted the computer to take it, with the object of the game to either score 21 exactly first (or be closest to 21 without going over), or get the computer to bust by going over 21. Doing so won $2,000 and a trip.\n\nOnce the computer hit 17 or more, its score froze for the rest of the game; this rule did not apply to the contestant.\n\nA second attempt actually made it to air when NBC, in the wake of the success of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", revived the tainted quiz show on January 9, 2000. The new version was produced by Phil Gurin and Fred Silverman. The rules of this version, hosted by Maury Povich (and announced by John Cramer), were somewhat different from those of the 1950s version. It was taped at NBC Studios, stage 1 in Burbank, the longtime studio of \"The Tonight Show\".\n\nA board game based on the original 1956–58 version was released by Lowell in 1957.\n\nA paperback quiz book featuring 1–11 point questions in each of the 45 categories was released by Pyramid in 1958.\n\n\"Twenty-One\" is one of only three Barry–Enright game shows known to have foreign adaptations, the others being \"Tic-Tac-Dough\" and \"Concentration\".\n\nThirty-two episodes are held by the Library of Congress. The episode on which Van Doren defeated Stempel was released as part of a retail home video compilation featuring other episodes of game shows.\n\nThe 2000 version is intact and has been rerun on Pax and Game Show Network.\n\n"}

He was born in Moseley, Birmingham to Joseph Walker, a landscape gardener, and his wife Emma. Val Walker worked as an electrical apparatus maker, later serving in the Royal Navy and was billed as the \"Wizard of the Navy\". Walker is credited as the designer of the \"Radium Girl\" illusion. His most famous escape was \"The Tank in the Thames\" where he was bolted into a steel tank lowered into the river Thames from the Sea-Scout Training Ship, Northampton on 20 August 1920. He escaped in 20 seconds. He was married in 1913 to Ethel Dora Harris, the daughter of Thomas Daniel Harris and his wife Emma Ellson. He retired from the stage in 1924, returning briefly in 1939, under the name of 'Val Enson', with an illusion called \"The Aquamarine Girl\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53537897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53537897", "title": "Video game preservation", "text": "Video game preservation\n\nVideo game preservation is a form of digital preservation applied to the video game industry. Such preservation efforts include archiving development source code and art assets, digital copies of video games, emulation of video game hardware, maintenance and preservation of specialized video game hardware such as arcade games and video game consoles, and digitization of print video game magazines and books prior to the Digital Revolution.\n\nUnlike most other forms of media like books, art and photography, and film which can preserved in a variety of formats that are not ladened with intellectual property (IP) issue, video games typically require specialized and/or proprietary computer hardware and software to read and execute game software. However, as technology advances, these older game systems become obsolete, no longer produced nor maintained to use for executing games. The media formats of the early days of computer gaming, relying on floppy discs and CD-ROMs, sufferes from disc rot and degrade over time, making it difficult to recover information. Further, video games tend to rely on other resources like operating systems, network connectivity, and external servers outside control of users, and making sure these boundary aspects to a video game are preserved along with the game are also essential.\n\nOne period of the video game industry that has received a great deal of attention is up through the 1980's. As a result of the video game crash of 1983, many companies involved in developing games folded or were acquired by other companies. In this process, the source code for many games prior to the crash were lost or destroyed, leaving only previously-sold copies of games on their original format as evidence of their existence.\n\nMost issues related to video game preservation are based on the United States, one of the largest markets for video games, and as such, issues related to preservation are limited by laws of the country.\n\nIn general, the copying and distribution of video games that are under copyright without authorization is considered a copyright violation (often called as software piracy). However, it has generally been allowed that users make may archival copies of software (including video games) as long as they own the original software; if the user sells or destroys the original software, they are expected to destroy the archival copies. This is also justification for a person being able to make ROM images from game cartridges that they own.\n\nIn 1998, the United Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), designed to bring copyright within the United States to align with two doctrines published by the World Intellectual Property Organization in 1996. The DMCA make it a criminal offense to develop, sell, or use technologies that are designed to bypass digital rights management (DRM) used in various forms of media. This subsequently made it illegal to backup up one's software for many games distributed via either game cartridge or optical disc, if some form of DRM was used to limit access to the software on the media.\n\nThe Library of Congress is responsible to open submissions for specific and narrow exemptions from interested parties every three years, and determine which of those, if any, to grant. Through the Library of Congress, some key exceptions to the DMCA have been granted to allow for video game preservation.\n\nThe DMCA exemptions do not mean all ROM images are legal, and concern about continuing video game preservation was raised in mid-2018, after Nintendo initiated a lawsuit against two website that distributed ROMs for games from their older platforms.\n\nVideo game console emulators use software that replicates the hardware of a video game console or arcade machine. Generally these create a virtual machine on newer computer systems that simulate the key processing units of the original hardware. The emulators then can read in software, such as a ROM image for arcade games or cartridge-based systems, or the game's optical media disc or an ISO image of that disc, to play the game in full. \n\nEmulation has been used in some official capacity on newer consoles. Nintendo's Virtual Console allows games from its earlier consoles and other third-parties to be played on its newer ones. Sony had originally released the PlayStation 3 with backwards compatibility with PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games if players had the original media, but have transitions to both selling emulated games in its PlayStation Store, as well as offering the PlayStation Now cloud gaming service that allows PlayStation 3 games to be played on other devices including the PlayStation 4 and compatible personal computers. Microsoft has created a backwards compatibility program through emulation to allow selected Xbox 360 titles to be played on the Xbox One if they own the original game and have made some of these titles available for purchase through Xbox Live. Former console hardware companies like Sega and Atari have released emulation-based collections of their games for multiple systems.\n\nIn personal computer space, there are also emulators that emulate either a game engine or a full operating system. In these cases, players are expected to own copies of the game to use the content files to support emulation. DOSBox emulates a complete IBM PC compatible operating system within modern operating systems, allowing most games for older computers to be run on modern systems. Emulators also exist for older arcade games, such as MAME.\n\nThere are legalities related to emulation that can make it difficult to preserve video games in this manner. First, the legalities of creating an emulator itself are unclear. Several United States case laws have shown that developing emulations is a legal activity, if done in a clean room fashion so that no proprietary information or copyrighted code is incorporated into the emulation. \n\nMigration refers to rereleasing software from one platform to a newer platform, otherwise keeping all the gameplay, narrative, and art assets the same. This can be done through a few routes:\n\nAbandonware refers to software that may still be capable of running on modern computers or consoles, but the developer or publisher has either disappeared, no longer sell the product, or no longer operate servers necessary for running the software, among other cases. \n\nLegally, such software still falls under normal copyright laws. Under the DMCA, the Copyright Office has made exceptions since 2015 for allowing museums and other archivists to bypass copyright issues to get such software into a playable state, a new exception seeks to allow this specifically for multiplayer games requiring servers, specifically massively-multiplayer online games.\n\nIn some cases, fans of a video game have helped to preserve the game to the best of their abilities without access to source code, even through the copyright nature of these fan projects are highly contentious, and moreos when monetary issues are involved. Games like \"\" and \"\", which had difficult production issues before release, may leave unused assets to be found by players, and in the case of both these games, players have developed unofficial patches that work to complete the content, in some cases, exceeding expectations of the original content creators.\n\nThe United States Library of Congress (LoC) launched the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) in 2000 to preserve non-traditional media. Around 2007, the LoC started reaching out to partners in various industries to help explore how they archive such content. The LoC had funded the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC) from 2004 to 2010 to develop the ECHO DEPository (\"Exploring Collaborations to Harvest Objects in a Digital Environment for Preservation\") program.\n\nPreserving Virtual Worlds was one project funded by the LoC and conducted by the Rochester Institute of Technology, Stanford University, the University of Maryland, and the\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, along with support from Linden Lab, running from 2008 to 2010. The study explored a range of games, from \"Spacewar!\" (1962) through \"Second Life\" (2003, which was developed by Linden Labs), to determine what methods could be used for preserving this titles. The project concluded while there are technical solutions for preservation of game software, such as identify common formats for digital storage and developing database architectures to track ownership, many issues related to preservation remain legal in nature relating to copyright laws.\n\nThe Internet Archive started adding emulation of video games from older systems for play. The Archive developed Emularity, a web-browser based emulator to run a number of out-of-production arcade, console and computer emulations, and offer numerous titles to be played through the Archive. The project's maintainer, Jason Scott, said that most companies do not take issue with their ROM images being offered in this manner, but did note that Nintendo has put pressure on them to not include any Nintendo consoles within the collection.\n\nFrank Cifaldi is one of the leading historians in the video game industry trying to encourage more video game preservation and to help recover games once thought lost. By 2017, he had spent about twenty years trying to encourage preservation as to track video game history, and established the non-profit Video Game History Foundation in 2017. The Foundation not only seeks to preserve games, but box art, manuals, and promotional material from video games, believing that these combined can help future historians understand the culture of games in the past.\n\nAmong other educational aspects The Strong institute in Rochester, New York operates the International Center for the History of Electronic Games.\n\nFounded in 2011 in Tokyo, the Game Preservation Society preserves the history of Japanese video games. The organization's focus is the preservation of 1980s Japanese computer games for platforms like the PC-88 and Sharp X1. The society's president, French national Joseph Redon, estimates that they will only be able to preserve about 80% of Japanese computer games.\n\nWhile strictly not set up for preservation, the National Software Reference Library, created and maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has included a number of popular game software among other software principally used for help in digital forensics, storing electronic copies of these games and other programs. The initial games collection was added in 2016 with numerous titles collected by Stephen Cabrinety, who had died in 1995; in 2018, Valve, Activision-Blizzard, and Electronic Arts all donated additional titles to be added to the collection, while NIST itself purchased other popular titles to include.\n\nCompanies like GOG.com and Night Dive Studios are recognized for helping to migrate older games to modern systems. Among their efforts include doing the research to track down all legal rights that are associated with a game, including those that have changed hands several times, as to get clearance or rights to republish the title, locate as much of the game's original source code and adapt that to work on modern systems, or when source code is not available, reverse engine the game to either work natively or through emulation (like DOSBox) with modern hardware. GOG.com and Night Dive have successfully freed some games from IP limbo, such as \"System Shock 2\", while identifying titles that remain difficult to republish and preserve legally due to conflicts on IP rights holders, such as \"No One Lives Forever\".\n"}
