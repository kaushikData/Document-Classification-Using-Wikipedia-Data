The film stars Jackie Earle Haley, Kyle Gallner, Rooney Mara, Katie Cassidy, Thomas Dekker, and Kellan Lutz. It is the ninth film in Elm Street franchise, and a remake of Wes Craven's 1984 film of the same name; produced by Michael Bay and Platinum Dunes, it is designed to reboot the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" franchise. The film centers around a group of teenagers living on one street in a fictitious town of Ohio being stalked and murdered in their dreams by a disfigured man named Freddy Krueger, ultimately discovering they all share a common link from their childhood that is making them targets for Krueger.\n\n\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was originally going to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, \"Friday the 13th\", with the writers taking the best elements from each of the films in the original series and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a simple child killer. The decision was also made to bring Freddy's physical appearance closer to that of an actual burn victim, and the use of computer-generated imagery was used in certain sections of Haley's face to further assist in that vision. \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was primarily filmed in Illinois because of the positive experience the producers of Platinum Dunes had when filming other films in the same area.\n\nCraven has expressed his displeasure with the remaking of his film, primarily because he was not consulted on the project as has been done on previous films of his that have been remade. Robert Englund, who portrayed Freddy in the previous eight films, voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role of Freddy. \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was officially released in North America on April 30, 2010, and later released in foreign markets on May 8, 2010. The film was met with primarily negative reviews from film critics, as well as audience members who scored the film a \"C+\" according to CinemaScore polls. Regardless, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" broke the record for midnight openings for a horror film, and was able to gross more in its opening weekend than the entire theatrical gross for four other \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" films. The film has brought in over $63 million at the domestic box office, and over $115 million worldwide.\n\nKris Fowles goes to the Springwood Diner to meet with her friend, Dean Russell, who falls asleep at the table. In Dean's dream, he meets a severely burned man, who wears dirty fedora, red-and-green striped sweater, and a bladed gardener's glove on his right hand. He cuts Dean's throat but in reality, it appears that Dean did it himself as Kris and their classmate, waitress Nancy Holbrook, look on. At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children, but cannot recall ever knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die like Dean. Jesse Braun, Kris's ex-boyfriend, shows up to keep her company while she sleeps, but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. Covered in her blood, Jesse runs to Nancy's house and learns that Nancy has been having nightmares about the same man: Freddy Krueger. Jesse tells Nancy that they need to stop Krueger and warns her not to fall asleep then runs off.\n\nJesse is apprehended by the police under suspicion of murdering Kris. He tries not to fall asleep but failed and is killed by Krueger in his jail cell. With her friends dying, Nancy begins to question what everyone's connection is to each other, given that none of them can remember each other before their teenage years. Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith discover that all of them attended Badham Preschool. Nancy's mother, Gwen, reluctantly tells Nancy and Quentin that there was a groundskeeper at the preschool, Fred Krueger, who was accused of abusing the children. Gwen explains that Nancy was his favorite, and that she came home one day telling her mother about the things Krueger did to her in a secret location. Gwen alerted the parents including Quentin's father Alan and Kris's mother Nora, but she claims Krueger escaped before he was arrested. Nancy does not believe her and attempts to track down the remaining kids from the school. She discovers that all of the other kids have been killed, most of them in their sleep and after Jesse’s death, only she and Quentin are left.\n\nQuentin tries to accept that his nightmares are nothing more than repressed memories, but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to Krueger: Everyone's parents tracked Krueger to an industrial park and burned him alive. Quentin and Nancy believe that Krueger, now a vengeful ghost, wants revenge on them for lying as children. As a result of their insomnia, they begin sporadically dreaming while they are still awake, experiencing microsleeps. To try to stop Krueger, they decide to go to the preschool and learn what they can. On the way, Nancy is attacked by Krueger after a microsleep episode, during which she pulls a piece of Krueger's sweater out of the dreamworld and into reality. Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital; there, he steals some adrenaline to help them stay awake. At the preschool, they uncover Krueger's hidden room and evidence that proves Krueger was in fact abusing all of the children; he actually wants revenge on them for telling the truth.\n\nNancy decides the only way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and explains that he deliberately left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would be comatose. Quentin awakes and uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy, who pulls Krueger into reality. They fight and Nancy uses a broken blade to kill him before she torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin safely escape. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror then disappears while Nancy screams.\n\n\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was originally going to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, \"Friday the 13th\", with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements from each of the films and creating a single storyline with them.

The film was met with primarily negative reviews from film critics, as well as audience members who scored the film a C+. Regardless, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" broke the record for midnight openings for a horror film. The film has brought in over $63 million at the domestic box office, and over $115 million worldwide.\n\nOn January 29, 2008, \"Variety\" reported that Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes production company would be rebooting the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" franchise with a remake of the original 1984 film. In an interview, producer Brad Fuller initially explained that they were following the same line they did with their \"Friday the 13th\" remake, by abandoning the things that made the character less scary—the film's antagonist, Freddy Krueger, would not be \"cracking jokes\" as had become a staple of his character in later films—and focusing more on trying to craft a \"horrifying movie\". Fuller expressed how everyone at the studio loved the concept of being killed if you fell asleep. The producer stated that the film would be a remake of the 1984 film, but clarified that they would be borrowing certain character deaths and dream sequences from the entire \"Nightmare\" series.\n\nIn February 2009, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" announced that Samuel Bayer was hired to direct the film. According to New Line production chief Toby Emmerich, Michael Bay advocated heavily for Bayer's hiring, as Bay, Bayer, and director David Fincher came up as commercial directors together. It is Bay's opinion that Bayer had \"the ability to capture the kind of seductive and unsettling imagery that would make \"Nightmare\" feel like a fresh, visually arresting moviegoing experience\". Bayer declined Platinum Dunes' offer; twice. It was not until Bay sent the director an email \"talking about the business\", and explaining what kind of opportunity it would be for Bayer that he finally agreed.\n\nIn a June 9, 2009 interview, Craven expressed his displeasure in the remaking of his 1984 film, primarily because the filmmakers chose not to have him as a consultant to the film, unlike with the 2009 remake \"The Last House on the Left\" where he \"shepherd[ed] it towards production\". In contrast, Robert Englund, who portrayed Freddy throughout the film series, felt it was time for \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" to be remade. Englund liked the idea of being able to \"exploit the dreamscape\" with CGI and other technologies that did not exist when Craven was making the original \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" in 1984. Subsequently, Bayer believed that the film is designed to pay homage to what Craven did in 1984, but not replicate it entirely. Bayer recognized that Craven attempted to put more meaning into his films, and that the character of Freddy Krueger was one that affected the lives of a certain generation of people. For Bayer, remaking \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was about bringing that feeling to a new generation, with a new spin on the character and story.\n\nFuller and Form likened the new \"Nightmare\" film to their 2003 remake of \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\", and retracted an earlier statement when they said they did not plan to \"cherry pick\" the best elements of the franchise, like they did with the reboot of the \"Friday the 13th\" franchise they released in 2009. Instead, the 2010 film is more of a reimagining. The pair also explained that \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" would have a different tone than the \"Friday the 13th\" remake. Form states, \"I think a \"Friday the 13th\" movie like we made was really fun. You know, sex, drugs and rock and roll, and I think a \"Nightmare\" movie is not that.\"\n\nWhen asked why New Line was rebooting the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" film series, Emmerich explained, \"The \"Nightmare\" films are profoundly disturbing on a deep, human level because they're about our dreams. It's why we thought that we could reach an especially broad audience with a new film, since the feeling of having your dreams being invaded was something that would translate to any country and any culture.\" Overall, Bayer wanted to create a darker \"Nightmare on Elm Street\", one he felt would fit into what he describes as \"a darker world\". Bayer said there is subtext within the film, which is designed to get the audience to ask, \"What makes a monster?\" Bayer wants the audience to think about whether a monster is something that exists purely from a physical appearance—someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove on their hand—or can a monster be something that is deeper, and within the man himself without a scarred face and bladed glove?\n\nWesley Strick was initially hired to pen a script for a new \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", after he impressed Emmerich with a prequel script he wrote for the 1995 film \"Seven\"; the film was never produced. Eric Heisserer was subsequently hired to provide a rewrite of Strick's script before the film moved into production. When Bayer came on board he received a script that reflected the combined efforts of Strick and Heisserer, and which still \"needed to be tinkered with\". Bayer explained that the script goes deeper into \"[Freddy] as a person [and] how he became the thing he was\". Bayer expressed that, unlike the \"Friday the 13th\" remake that picked the best parts from the first four films, the \"Nightmare\" remake is coming straight from the first film. At one point there was a scene in an early draft of the script where some characters were playing \"Guitar Hero\". Fuller explained that the scene was removed to keep the film from feeling dated. To him, if someone watched the film five years later, and \"Guitar Hero\" was not as popular as it once was, it would automatically make the film feel more dated upon viewing. At the same time, they wanted the film to feel relevant, and including things like the Internet, mobile phones, and text messaging would give the film a more timeless feel.\n\nFor the remake, Freddy was brought back to his darker roots and away from the comical character he had become in later \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.\n\nIn February 2009, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" revealed Robert Englund would not reprise the role of Freddy Krueger for the remake; Englund had performed the role for the eight previous films. On April 3, 2009 \"Entertainment Weekly\" reported that Jackie Earle Haley was cast to take over Englund's most well-known role. Initially, the studio wanted to cast an unknown for the role of Freddy Krueger, but it was Haley's performance in \"Little Children\" that impressed Emmerich enough to cast the actor against the original intentions. Emmerich explained, \"Freddy is this incredible stew of malevolence and anger, but he also has a hint of vulnerability, and Jackie really has all of that and more. He just seemed completely right for the part.\" Bayer stated that he and producers Form and Fuller managed to acquire the screen test Haley gave as Rorschach for \"Watchmen\"; after viewing it, Bayer said it \"blew [his] mind\", and that he knew Haley would be able to go deep and create a believable character who was a \"[psychopath] with a burned face and a claw\".\n\nHaley said the first time he heard his name mentioned in conjunction with the character was from people suggesting his casting on the internet, which he appreciated, and then later learned that his agents were already in talks with Brad Fuller. Haley stated that he was apprehensive about taking on the role of a character with such a dark past—that of a child murderer—for about a \"minute and a half\". Knowing the Freddy Krueger in the remake would be even darker, Haley came to the realization quickly that at the end of the day he is doing a horror film, and this is just a fictional character. Haley said that once he embraced the idea of Freddy just being a \"mythical boogeyman\", it became \"very freeing\" for him as an actor.\n\nHaley is contracted for three films, which includes the remake and two sequels. Englund stated he agreed with the casting of Haley, noting that he feels Haley's physical size works for him in this role. Explaining why they chose to take away the comical aspect of Freddy's personality, Form and Fuller stated, \"We've never been attracted to a jokey antagonist because it feels less scary and less real\". Even though the character is closer to how he was portrayed in the original film, Haley has stated that he does not intend to have Englund's performances influence his own. Haley stated that he used the frustration of having to sit in the make-up chair for three-and-a-half hours as his motivation to get into character.\n\nRooney Mara plays the role of Nancy Holbrook; Mara is also contracted for a sequel. Bayer describes Nancy as \"the loneliest girl in the world\". Mara stated that her Nancy is different than the role of Nancy Thompson, performed by Heather Langenkamp, and described her character as \"socially awkward and timid and really doesn't know how to connect with people\". Kyle Gallner was cast as Quentin, who forms a connection with Nancy. Gallner described his character as \"a mess, more jittery and more 'out there' than Nancy is\". Gallner pointed out that his character is like this because of the amount of pharmaceuticals he ingests to stay awake. Producer Brad Fuller commented that Gallner brought a sense of \"humanity and relatability\" to the role with his compassion and intellect. Other cast members include Katie Cassidy, Thomas Dekker, and Kellan Lutz. Cassidy performed the role of Kris. According to Cassidy, Kris becomes an emotional wreck throughout the film. Cassidy described her character's ordeal: \"She is literally dragged through hell, having to crawl through dark, claustrophobic tunnels. She's always crying and freaking out as her nightmares of Freddy bleed into her everyday life. Kris suspects there's something that connects her with the others; she even confronts her mother about it, but no one's talking.\"\n\nDekker portrays Jesse, Kris's ex-boyfriend. According to Dekker, \"Jesse kind of knows what's going on but refuses to believe it.\" Dekker explained that Jesse spends so much time trying to convince himself that Freddy is not real, that by the time he does meet Freddy face-to-face, \"he's just a mess.. […] There's no bravado about it. His terror is very real.\" Lutz plays Dean, Kris's current boyfriend and \"a well-liked, well-off high school jock\". Connie Britton, Clancy Brown and Elvis Jasso Marín also star. Gallner and Mara explained that the teenagers in the remake are \"a little more aware\" of Freddy and their situation, whereas in the original Gallner and Mara characterized Nancy and her friends as \"more mellow\" and \"nonchalant\" about their situation until they were finally killed.\n\nDiscussing his physical appearance, Form and Fuller explained that Freddy would be more similar to a real burn victim. Form later clarified that there was a fine line they did not want to cross when it came to making Freddy look like a true burn victim. According to the producer, the crew had many reference photos of actual victims, which detailed how white the skin would appear after healing. Form did not want the audience to turn away in disgust every time Freddy was on the screen, so they opted to hold back on some of the realism. Fuller noted how horrific the images were, and how difficult they were to look at. The special effects crew that worked on \"The Dark Knight\", creating the computer-generated images (CGI) for Two-Face's face, were brought in to work on the minimal CGI used for Freddy's face. The CGI is used in conjunction with the special effects make-up that Haley wears. The prosthetics used to create Freddy's physical look were designed by Andrew Clement. Haley described the experience of wearing all of the prosthetics and make-up as \"pretty encumbering\".\n\nWhen production first started, Clement and his crew would spend six hours applying Haley's make-up; eventually, the crew was able to streamline their process. According to Haley, the make-up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him, from his head all the way down his back, which were glued to his body. The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance. Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make-up chair to apply the prosthetics, each day; on occasion, it would take almost four-and-a-half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap, which Haley did not need to worry about most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head. Haley also had to wear contact lenses, one that was bloody and another that was cloudy, with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to see out of. Haley also had to work on developing Freddy's \"voice\" for the film. According to Haley, the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy is \"this organic process of embodying the character\", and not about just \"sitting around the table and going, 'Let me try this voice and this voice'\". Haley and Bayer admitted that some of the voice would be digitally enhanced in the end to give it a \"supernatural quality\" and get it away from the voice Haley used as Rorschach in \"Watchmen\".\n\nWith a budget of $35 million, principal photography began on May 5, 2009 and officially wrapped on July 10, 2009. Platinum Dunes chose to film in Illinois because of pleasurable filming experiences in the state when the company produced \"The Amityville Horror\" and \"The Unborn\". Platinum Dunes also received a thirty percent tax break for filming in the state. For a representation of human version of Krueger, the producers were looking for locations that were \"old and decaying\". They settled on the Ryerson Steel warehouse on the West Side of Chicago. The warehouse became the central location for the scenes involving the townspeople burning Krueger alive.\n\nNew Line contracted with two high schools in Illinois, Elk Grove High School and John Hersey High School, to use their location for scenes in the remake. According to Principal Nancy Holman, of Elk Grove High, the studio contacted schools across the nation looking for one that had a swimming pool. Although filming took place at both schools, neither was identified by name. The studio also cast 200 extras for various school scenes, including one in the pool, but required that all auditioning students be at least 16 years old. School board President Lenore Gonzales Bragaw was initially apprehensive about the deal, as she disliked the idea of the studio filming \"scenes of violence\" at the schools; Bragaw agreed to the filming after being assured that no one would be killed during the swimming scenes.\n\nOn May 22, 2009, the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" film crew went on location to the city of Gary, Indiana to film scenes at a Methodist church. The studio negotiated with the city for months before finally settling on a deal. According to Ben Clement, the executive director of the Gary Office of Film and Television, the studio was looking for \"an architectural style that would fit the storyline of the film\". The film crew returned to Gary in June to film a dream sequence that takes place on Elm Street in one of the local streets, and in December some new scenes were shot in a diner, with new characters.\n\nAccording to Fuller and Form, Warner Bros. suggested \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" be released in 3-D, with the recent surge in 3-D films showing increased box office revenue. In the opinion of the Platinum Dunes producers, if a film is not initially conceived as 3-D then it should not be converted to 3-D. In other words, given that the original \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was not a 3-D film, Fuller and Form fought with the studio to keep the remake from being converted to 3-D. The producers note that at the end of the day, Warner Bros. and Platinum Dunes came to the agreement that presenting the film in 3-D would not be presenting \"the best version of the movie\".\n\nThe score to \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was composed by Steve Jablonsky, whom he produced with Steve Durkee and recorded the film's music with a 60-piece string ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage. Jablonsky's musical score was released by WaterTower Music on April 27, 2010.\n\n\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was released on April 30, 2010 to 3,332 theaters and approximately 4,700 screens, making it the twelfth-widest opening for an R-rated film in the United States. Comparatively, the original \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was only released to 165 theaters on its opening, November 9, 1984; its widest release by the end of its box office run was 380 theaters. The 2010 remake holds the record for widest \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" release, beating out \"Freddy vs. Jason\" by 318 theaters. \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 5, 2010. The DVD's only feature is a featurette, \"Freddy Krueger Reborn\". The Blu-ray special features include the DVD's featurette along with a deleted scene, an alternate opening and ending, and the \"Maniacle Movie Mode\".\n\nEarly estimates put \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\"s opening-day gross at approximately $15 million, with a projected opening weekend of $35 million. Included in the $15 million is the $1.6 million the film made from midnight showings on Thursday night from 1,000 theaters. As a result, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" broke the record for midnight openings for a horror film, which was previously held by the \"Friday the 13th\" remake in 2009 that grossed $1 million. Ultimately, the film finished its opening with $32,902,299, placing first for the weekend ahead of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" (6th week in release), \"Date Night\" (4th week in release), \"The Back-up Plan\" (2nd week in release), and \"Furry Vengeance\"; the latter film was also in its opening weekend. \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" dropped 72 percent in its second weekend, earning $9,119,389; dropping to second place for the weekend behind \"Iron Man 2\". The film dropped an additional 54 percent in its third week, bringing in $1.5 million, though it remained in the top 10 rankings for the weekend, placing sixth overall. The film remained in the top ten for the fourth weekend in a row, grossing approximately $2,285,000 and finishing eighth for the week. In its fifth weekend, the 2010 remake fell out of the box office top ten, finishing eleventh with an estimated $910,000.\n\nAs of July 6, 2010, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" has earned $63,071,122 at the domestic box office. With its $63 million in domestic box office, \"A Nightmare On Elm Street\" is the second-highest-grossing film among the recent slasher remakes, like \"When a Stranger Calls\" (2006), \"Black Christmas\" (2006), \"Halloween\" (2007), \"Prom Night\" (2008), and \"My Bloody Valentine 3D\" (2009) but behind \"Friday the 13th\" with $65 million. The film was officially released overseas on May 8, 2010. In its opening weekend, it took in approximately $6.5 million throughout ten foreign territories. It also secured first place for the weekend at the Russian box office, with $3 million. Since its opening, the film has taken in approximately $52,332,285 in the overseas box office, giving it a worldwide total gross of $115,407,296.\n\nThe 2010 remake's opening weekend puts it ahead of the box office grosses for \"\" ($29,999,213), \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" ($25,504,513), \"\" ($22,168,359), and \"Wes Craven's New Nightmare\" ($18,090,181). When adjusting the opening weekend for the 1984 original for the 2010 inflation, the remake out grossed Wes Craven's film $32,902,299 to $2,736,653. When breaking the grosses down by per theater capita, the 1984 film averaged $16,585 per cinema compared to the remake's $9,874. Comparing the film to other Platinum Dunes remakes, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" is second in opening-weekend gross, only behind \"Friday the 13th\" with $40,570,365. The film sits ahead of the other Platinum Dunes remakes, which includes 2003's \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" ($28,094,014), 2005's \"The Amityville Horror\" ($23,507,007), and 2007's \"The Hitcher\" ($7,818,239). \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" currently sits as the sixth-highest opening for an April weekend.\n\nThe remake is currently the eighth-all-time-highest-grossing slasher film in unadjusted dollars. It is also ninth all-time among horror remakes, dating back to 1982, in unadjusted dollars. When comparing its opening weekends to other slasher films and horror remakes, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" sits in fifth spots for both categories. The 2010 remake currently sits as the second-highest-grossing \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" film in the franchise in North America, just behind \"Freddy vs. Jason\" ($82,622,655), in unadjusted dollars.\n\nBased on 176 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" holds a 15% overall approval rating from critics, with an average score of 3.7 out of 10. The consensus at Rotten Tomatoes is the following: \"Visually faithful but lacking the depth and subversive twists that made the original so memorable, the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" remake lives up to its title in the worst possible way.\" By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 35, based on 25 reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was a \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale, with exit polls showing that audiences were evenly divided between males and females, with 40% between 18–24 years of age and 20% under 18.\nOwen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave it a \"B–\" and concluded that, \"I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays a little too much like a corporately ordered rerun. One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, we've been there before\". Michael Rechtshaffen of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" criticized the acting calling it \"lethargically lifeless\" and criticized Haley's portrayal of Krueger, saying, \"Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there's just no replacing Englund\". Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film one star out of four, writing in his review, \"I stared at \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are we supposed to be scared? Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response?\".\n\nOn January 5, 2011, the film won the People's Choice Award for \"Best Horror Film\".\n\nIn March 2010, the National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) released two new Freddy Krueger action figures; one pre-burned Freddy with Jackie Earle Haley's likeness, and one based on the new burn design from the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" remake. In addition, NECA also released a replica of Freddy's clawed glove. In conjunction with the film, an online game was released where the user attempted to keep a young girl awake—through the use of coffee, cold showers, self-mutilation, and other various means—so as to keep her safe from Freddy.\n\n"}

Among its demands is the decriminalization of abortion.\n\nThe organization was founded and incorporated in March 1995 to the Central de los Trabajadores Argentinos. The Embassy of the Netherlands in the city of Buenos Aires contributed to the installation of the office that the union currently has within the building of the CTA.\n\nIn the international arena, starting in 1997 and on the basis of contacts with different organizations nearby, the Sexual Workers Network of Latin America and the Caribbean was created; In it, organizations and focal points of the different countries of the continent are articulated. Elena Reynaga, as representative of Ammar, chairs this network.\n\nAmmar's action contributed to the repeal of police edicts and the decriminalization of street prostitution in the city of Buenos Aires for a brief period, until the reform of Article 71 of the Contraventional Code on March 4, 1999, which again sanctioned the offer of sex on public roads in certain cases.\n\nOn January 27, 2004, Sandra Cabrera, general secretary of AMMAR in Rosario, was murdered. Cabrera had filed complaints against some local police officers, accusing them of corruption and asking for money from local sex workers in exchange for letting them work. For this reason she received threats, both against her and her daughter. In November 2003 she was brutally beaten inside her home and threatened to stop reporting. She was shot in the head two months after.

Once, even this interest had waned, until the creation of the air show Bakraid, in which the capabilities of the fighters could be demonstrated outside of simulations for all to see.\n\nAround the time of the seventh Bakraid, a nearby nation, Deneb, had attained an expansionist attitude, forcibly subjugating and annexing several of its neighbors with the assistance of the Shtarterra Security Council. Recently, Deneb has asked to participate in Bakraid. Randa's defense council, perfectly aware that this is just a pretext for Deneb to get its and the SSC's engines of war into Randan borders and more easily prosecute their war from there, give their blessing. However, the council secretly contacts the other Bakraid participants, offering even more prize money than normal if they will perform in a special version of Bakraid—genuine war conditions. In other words, use their own top-of-the-line planes to shatter Deneb's schemes. In all, nine pilots accept this plan, and begin Bakraid two weeks early to catch Deneb unaware...\n\n\nAfter choosing Normal or Advance course, Stage Edit mode allows player to choose the sequence of stages 2–5 from a set of 4 stages.\n\nIn Special/Only Boss mode, an additional Stage I is included, which consists of mid-boss battle in Cloud stage (Stage 6).\n\nThere are initially 4 fighters, with extra fighters available by using unlock codes (up to 9 fighters). Pressing different buttons when choosing a fighter can alter a fighter's ability:\n\nWhen using Team Edit, player can choose different fighters for successive lives after the initial fighter is destroyed. If Team Edit is unavailable, it can be unlocked by inserting a coin and press Up, Down, Up, Down Left, Right, Left, Right, A, B, Start before timer passes 10.\n\nFighter's rapid fire rate can be increased by holding C then press A when inside a stage, or decreased by holding C then press B when inside a stage.\n\n\n\nSome enemies drop medals when destroyed.

If there are multiple on-screen medals, player can restore medal level after missing a medal by collecting the remaining highest value medal on-screen without missing further medals, before revealing any other medal.\n\nWhenever a player's fighter destroys a large enemy, a score multiplier is set. The multiplier doubles every time a large enemy is destroyed before timer reaches 0, for up to 64. The multiplier timer increases whenever a large enemy is destroyed. When multiplier is in effect and the player's medal level is already at 10000 points, revealing medal causes 100000-point medal to appear instead. When multiplier timer reaches 0, the score multiplier effect simply disappears.\n\nBakraid features a dynamically adjusting rank system that makes the game harder, similar to the rank system in Armed Police Batrider and Battle Garegga. The rank increases when the player collects items, fires its weapons, or uses its bombs. The rank will only decrease when the player grazes bullets or loses lives. In Bakraid, it's easier to graze bullets and survive than in Batrider since the player sprites are larger in comparison to their hitbox.\n\nBakraid has a fixed moderate starting rate at the beginning of the game compared to the high starting rank of Batrider and the minimum starting rank of Battle Garegga. Still, it's no surprise players would suicide or graze bullets to decrease the rank for the game.\n\nAs rank increases, more bullets spawn, some bullets move faster, attack patterns are generally trickier to negotiate, and enemies gain health.\n\n"}

The books deal with topical issues such as drug abuse, Satanism, teenage pregnancy or AIDS, and are presented as cautionary tales. Although Sparks presented herself as merely the discoverer and editor of the diaries, records at the U.S. Copyright Office show that in fact she is listed as the sole author for all but two of them.\n\nBeatrice Ruby Mathews Sparks was born in Goldburg, Custer County, Idaho and grew up in Logan, Utah. She began working with teenagers in 1955, after attending the University of California at Los Angeles and Brigham Young University. She worked as a music therapist at Utah State Mental Hospital and taught continuing education courses at BYU.\n\nCritics have questioned Sparks's qualifications and experience. Researchers have been unable to find a record of the Ph.D. she claimed on book jackets and in her résumé. One interviewer wrote that Sparks was \"vague about specifics\" when asked about her counselling qualifications and professional experience.\n\nSparks stated that her experiences working with troubled adolescents made her want to produce cautionary tales that would keep other teens from falling into the same traps. Her first work, \"Go Ask Alice\", was published under the byline \"Anonymous\" in 1971. In interviews conducted over the next few years, Sparks identified herself as the book's editor and related that \"Alice\" consisted partly of the actual diary of a troubled teen, and partly of fictional events based on Sparks's experiences working with other teens. Sparks was unable to produce the original diary for critics. Later editions of the book contained the standard disclaimer: \"This book is a work of fiction. Any references to historical events, real people, or real locales are used fictitiously. Other names, places, characters, and incidents are the product of the author's imagination, and any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.\"\n\nIn 1973, after the publication of \"Go Ask Alice,\" Marcella Barrett, a Pleasant Grove, Utah woman, approached Sparks to edit the journal of Barrett's deceased son Alden. Alden had suffered from depression and committed suicide at age sixteen and Barrett felt that his story might help other at-risk teens. The result was \"Jay's Journal,\" which tells the story of a teenage boy drawn into Satanism. Barrett's family was horrified by the book. They insisted that Alden had never been involved with the occult and that Sparks had used only 21 entries from his journal (out of 212 supposed entries that appeared in the finished book). Sparks defended the book, claiming she got the extra material from letters and interviews with Alden's friends.\n\nAfter \"Jay's Journal,\" Sparks produced many more \"real diaries,\" including \"It Happened to Nancy: By an Anonymous Teenager\" (dealing with AIDS), \"\" (gang violence), \"Annie's Baby: The Diary of Anonymous, A Pregnant Teenager\", \"Treacherous Love: The Diary of an Anonymous Teenager\" (pupil seduced by teacher), \"Kim: Empty Inside: The Diary of an Anonymous Teenager\" (eating disorders) and \"Finding Katie: The Diary of Anonymous, A Teenager in Foster Care\".\n\nAll these books were published with the byline 'Anonymous'. Some of them credit Sparks as editor; others (such as \"Go Ask Alice\") do not mention her at all. \"Almost Lost\" and \"Kim: Empty Inside\" are the only books for which Sparks does not claim copyright as author of the entire work. For both these books, Sparks lays claim only to the editing, compilation and some (unspecified) additional material. The U.S. Copyright Office record for \"Kim\" adds the note that some material is taken from a preexisting diary.\n\n\n\n"}

The company was first established in 1976 as Cinar, a Montreal-based studio that was heavily involved in children's entertainment. The company's business model, which included the licensing of its properties into educational markets, had a significant impact on its success; by 1999, Cinar held CDN$1.5 billion of the overall children's television market.\n\nIn the 2000s, Cinar became the subject of multiple business scandals, including accusations that the company had used offshore accounts to transfer money out of the company, had plagiarized the concept of one of its series, and had obfuscated the involvement of American screenwriters in its productions in order to continue receiving Canadian tax credits for domestic productions. Over a decade later, these scandals would result in criminal charges, convictions, and fines for co-founder Ronald Weinberg, and three other suspects.\n\nCinar was sold in 2004 for $190 million to a group led by Nelvana founder Michael Hirsh, and re-named Cookie Jar Group. The company went to acquire the American animation studio DiC Entertainment in 2008. On August 20, 2012, DHX Media announced its intent to acquire Cookie Jar Group, in a deal that would make DHX the largest independent owner of children's television programming. The sale completed on October 22, 2012. Cookie Jar Group continues to operate as an in-name-only unit of DHX Media.\n\nAfter their 1976 meeting in New Orleans, future spouses Micheline Charest and Ronald A. Weinberg organized an event for a women's film festival, and worked at distributing foreign films to US theatres. The couple moved to New York City and formed Cinar, a film and television distribution company.\n\nIn 1984, Cinar changed their focus from media distribution to production and moved operations to Montreal, where they concentrated on children's television programming (including \"Animal Crackers\", \"Emily of New Moon\", \"Mona the Vampire\", and \"The Wombles\"), as well as the English and French dubs of the anime series \"Adventures of the Little Koala\" and \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" and the Spain-originating TV series \"The World of David the Gnome\", and the English dub of \"Ultra Seven\". As a production company, Cinar was also involved in the work of \"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\", \"The Busy World of Richard Scarry\", \"Madeline\", \"The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You\", \"The Adventures of Paddington Bear\", \"Space Cases\", \"The Shoe People\" and its most famous work, \"Arthur\", \"Zoboomafoo\" and \"Caillou\".\n\nThe firm became a public company in September 1993. By 1999, Cinar boasted annual revenues of $150 million (CAD) and owned about $1.5 billion (CAD) of the children's television market. In 1996, Cinar acquired the library of the British animation studio FilmFair, and closed it in 1998. In February 1999, Cinar acquired the film library of Leucadia Film Corporation.\n\nThe success of Charest, Weinberg, and Cinar ended in March 2000, when an internal audit revealed that about $122 million (US) was invested into Bahamian bank accounts without the board members' approval. Cinar had also paid American screenwriters for work while continuing to accept federal grants and tax credits for the production of Canadian content. The names of Canadian citizens (generally non-writers connected to Cinar, including Charest's sister Helene) were credited for the works. While the province of Quebec did not file criminal charges, Cinar denied any wrongdoing, choosing instead to pay a settlement to Canadian and Quebec tax authorities of $17.8 million (CAD) and another $2.6 million (CAD) to Telefilm Canada, a Canadian federal funding agency. The value of Cinar's stock plummeted, and the company was soon delisted.\n\nThere was some speculation that Hasanain Panju, CFO was the mastermind behind the investment scheme along with John Xanthoudakis of Norshield Investment Group and Lino Matteo of Mount Real Corporation. It was alleged that Charest and Weinberg (and later Panju) used Cinar as a 'piggy bank' and schemed to transfer funds out from the company through a series of complicated transactions to their own offshore holding companies.\n\nIn 2001, as part of a settlement agreement with the Commission des Valeurs Mobilières du Québec (Quebec Securities Commission) Charest and Weinberg agreed to pay $1 million each and were banned from serving in the capacity of directors or officers at any publicly traded Canadian company for five years. There was no admission of guilt and none of the allegations has been proven in court. Charest never lived to see a possible outcome, as she died on April 14, 2004.\n\nOn August 26, 2009, in a separate case, the Superior Court of Quebec ruled that Cinar had plagiarized the work of Claude Robinson for its animated series \"Robinson Sucroe\". The series was based on a concept he had pitched to Cinar in 1986, but had been turned down. Robinson was awarded $5.2 million in damages, in a suit that resolved a 14-year dispute between the two parties.\n\nOn January 17, 2014, former CFO Hasanain Panju pleaded guilty to undisclosed crimes. The judge noted these crimes were \"disgraceful\" and placed a publication ban on details surrounding the trial. Panju was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nOn May 12, 2014, co-founder Ronald Weinberg, John Xanthoudakis of Norshield Financial Group and Lino Matteo of Mount Real Corp. were charged with 26 counts of fraud in Montreal Superior Court. They were convicted on most of the counts on June 2, 2016, and in the trial Panju acted as a key Crown witness. On June 22, 2016, Weinberg was sentenced to 8 years and 11 months in prison, and the other two received sentences of 7 years and 11 months each.\n\nThe Cinar affair was described thus by \"The Globe and Mail\":\n\nIn March 2004, Cinar was purchased for more than CA$190 million by a group led by Nelvana founder, Michael Hirsh and former Nelvana President, Toper Taylor. The company was subsequently renamed Cookie Jar.\n\nOn June 20, 2008, Cookie Jar Group announced a deal to acquire DIC Entertainment. On July 23, 2008, the acquisition was completed, and eventually DIC was folded into Cookie Jar's entertainment division. When Cookie Jar acquired DIC Entertainment, Cookie Jar also acquired Copyright Promotions Licensing Group and a one-third interest in international children's television channel, KidsCo. Cookie Jar now has more than 6,000 half-hours of programming as well as rights to several children's brands. Also it was announced that Cookie Jar was in negotiation with American Greetings to buy the \"Care Bears\", \"Strawberry Shortcake\", and \"Sushi Pack\" franchises. The deal was not finalized yet in late 2008 and with the current scenario, the transaction did not progress. On March 30, 2009, Cookie Jar made a $76 million counter bid for Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake. Cookie Jar had until April 30, 2009 to complete a deal with American Greetings. In May 2009, American Greetings filed a $100 million lawsuit against Cookie Jar and Cookie Jar filed a $25 million lawsuit against American Greetings over the Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake deal.\n\nIn February 2011, the company announced a slate of primetime series in development under a new imprint known as \"The Jar\", including \"Varsity\" for TeenNick, \"All Over You\" for Lifetime, \"Know It Alls\" for The Hub in the United States and Family in Canada, \"Blah Girls\" for MTV, \"Lords of the Playground\" for CBS, and \"Spyburbia\" for Fox in the United States and Global in Canada.\n\nOn August 20, 2012, DHX Media announced that they would acquire Cookie Jar Group for $111 million; the purchase made DHX the world's largest independent owner of children's television programming. The acquisition was completed in October 22, 2012.\n\nAt the time of Cookie Jar's acquisition of the company, DIC had been programming a weekend morning block for CBS known as \"KEWLopolis\". On February 24, 2009, it was announced that CBS had renewed its contract with Cookie Jar for the block through 2012. For the 2009-10 television season, the block was re-branded as Cookie Jar TV. Cookie Jar TV was discontinued after the 2012-13 television season; it was succeeded in 2013-14 by \"CBS Dream Team\", which is programmed by Litton Entertainment.\n\nOn November 1, 2008, This TV launched airing Cookie Jar's daily children's programming block Cookie Jar Toons which provided children's and E/I-oriented programming.\n\nCookie Jar Kids Network (formerly DiC Kids Network) was a children's programming block that aired selected Cookie Jar programs on local FOX, MyNetworkTV, and independent stations to provide them with a source of Educational/Informational (E/I) programming required by American broadcast standards. Syndicated by Ascent Media, it ceased broadcasting on September 17, 2011.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3774893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3774893", "title": "Danish Golden Age", "text": "Danish Golden Age\n\nThe Danish Golden Age () covers a period of exceptional creative production in Denmark, especially during the first half of the 19th century. Although Copenhagen had suffered from fires, bombardment and national bankruptcy, the arts took on a new period of creativity catalysed by Romanticism from Germany. The period is probably most commonly associated with the Golden Age of Danish Painting from 1800 to around 1850 which encompasses the work of Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg and his students, including Wilhelm Bendz, Christen Købke, Martinus Rørbye, Constantin Hansen and Wilhelm Marstrand, as well as the sculpture of Bertel Thorvaldsen.\n\nIt also saw the development of Danish architecture in the Neoclassical style. Copenhagen, in particular, acquired a new look, with buildings designed by Christian Frederik Hansen and Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll.\n\nIn relation to music, the Golden Age covers figures inspired by Danish romantic nationalism including J. P. E. Hartmann, Hans Christian Lumbye, Niels W. Gade and the ballet master August Bournonville. Literature centred on Romantic thinking, introduced in 1802 by the Norwegian-German philosopher Henrik Steffens. Key contributors were Adam Oehlenschläger, Bernhard Severin Ingemann, N. F. S. Grundtvig and, last but not least, Hans Christian Andersen, the proponent of the modern fairytale. Søren Kierkegaard furthered philosophy while Hans Christian Ørsted achieved fundamental progress in science. The Golden Age thus had a profound effect not only on life in Denmark but, with time, on the international front too.\n\nThe origins of the Golden Age can be traced back to around the beginning of the 19th century, which was a very rough period for Denmark. Copenhagen, the centre of the country's intellectual life, first experienced huge fires in 1794 and 1795 which destroyed both Christiansborg Palace and large areas of the inner city. In 1801, as a result of the country's involvement in the League of Armed Neutrality, the British fleet inflicted serious damage on the city during the Battle of Copenhagen. In 1807, on rumours that the French might force Denmark to close the Baltic to their shipping, the British once again bombarded Copenhagen, this time specifically targeting the city and its civilian population. Then in 1813, as a result of the country's inability to support the costs of war, Denmark declared a State bankruptcy. To make matters worse, Norway ceased to be part of the Danish realm when it was ceded to Sweden the following year.\n\nCopenhagen's devastation nevertheless provided new opportunities. Architects and planners widened the streets, constructing beautifully designed Neoclassical buildings offering a brighter yet intimate look. At the time, with a population of only 100,000, the city was still quite small, built within the confines of the old ramparts. As a result, the leading figures of the day met frequently, sharing their ideas, bringing the arts and the sciences together. Henrik Steffens was perhaps the most effective proponent of the Romantic idea. In a series of lectures in Copenhagen, he successfully conveyed the ideas behind German romanticism to the Danes. Influential thinkers, such as Oehlenschläger and Grundtvig were quick to take up his views. It was not long before Danes from all branches of the arts and sciences were involved in a new era of Romantic nationalism, later known as the Danish Golden Age.\n\nEspecially in the field of painting, change became apparent. While art had previously served to uphold the monarchy and the establishment, Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg and his students realized that, with the arrival of industrialization, the middle classes were increasingly gaining power and influence. Grand historical art gave way to more widely appealing but less pretentious genre paintings and landscapes.\n\nThe Golden Age is generally believed to have lasted until about 1850. Around that time, Danish culture suffered from the outbreak of the First Schleswig War (1848–1851). In addition, political reforms involving the end of the absolute monarchy in 1848 and the adoption of the Danish constitution the following year signalled the beginning of a new era. Finally, the extension of Copenhagen beyond the old ramparts during the 1850s opened up new horizons for urban expansion.\n\nIt was not until 1890 that the Danish philosopher Valdemar Vedel first used the term \"Guldalderen\" or Golden Age to describe the period. In 1896, author Vilhelm Andersen saw the Golden Age initiated by Henrich Steffens as the richest period in the cultural history of Denmark.\n\nAround the beginning of the 19th century, the Golden Age of Danish Painting emerged to form a distinct national style for the first time since the Middle Ages; the period lasted until the middle of the century. It has a style drawing on Dutch Golden Age painting, especially its landscape painting, and depicting northern light that is soft but allows strong contrasts of colour. The treatment of scenes is typically an idealized version of reality, but unpretentiously so, appearing more realist than is actually the case. Interior scenes, often small portrait groups, are also common, with a similar treatment of humble domestic objects and furniture, often of the artist's circle of friends. Little Danish art was seen outside the country (indeed it mostly remains there to this day) although the Danish-trained leader of German Romantic painting Caspar David Friedrich was important in spreading its influence in Germany.\n\nA crucial figure was Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, who had studied in Paris with Jacques-Louis David and was further influenced towards Neo-Classicism by the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. Eckersberg taught at the Academy from 1818 to 1853, becoming director from 1827 to 1828, and was an important influence on the following generation, in which landscape painting came to the fore. He taught most of the leading artists of the period, including: Wilhelm Bendz, Albert Küchler, Christen Købke, Vilhelm Kyhn, Jørgen Roed, Holger Roed, Martinus Rørbye, Constantin Hansen and Wilhelm Marstrand.\nAn investigation of drawings, underdrawings, oil sketches and finished paintings by Eckersberg and his pupils Christen Købke and Constantin Hansen, using their Italian views as examples, points to a number of important aspects which shed light on the creative process in Danish Golden Age painting in the first half of the 19th century. The preliminary drawings – preferably composition drawings – which were done in front of the motif were meticulously constructed and reproduced many details. Architecture received the painters’ greatest attention, whereas vegetation, rocks and stones as well as figures in the landscape received a lower priority. The drawing done directly from the motif was squared up in several instances with a view to its transference to the painting, which was often no larger than the drawing. Some elements could be altered during the\nprocess, but by and large the artist retained the original dispositions quite precisely.\nIn some cases the architecture was consciously altered so as to strengthen the forms and create harmony in the picture. In this way, we can prove that although the Italian motifs appear realistic at first sight, they were nonetheless adjusted or even manipulated by the artists.\n\nProminent artists of the Danish Golden Age of Painting included Wilhelm Bendz (1804–1832), remembered for his many technically accomplished portraits of fellow artists such as Ditlev Blunck and Christen Christensen, a scene from the Academy's anatomy class, as well as the group portraits \"A Tobacco Party\" and \"Artist in the Evening at Finck's Coffee House in Munich\"; Constantin Hansen (1804–1880), deeply interested in literature and mythology and inspired by Niels Laurits Høyen, who developed national historical painting based on Norse mythology and painted many portraits, including the historical The Constitutional Assembly (\"Den grundlovgivende Rigsforsamling\");\nChristen Købke (1810–48), influenced by Niels Laurits Høyen, an art historian who promoted a nationalistic approach calling for artists to search for subject matter in the folk life of their country instead of searching for themes in other countries such as Italy; Wilhelm Marstrand (1810–1873), a vastly productive artist who mastered a remarkable variety of genres, remembered especially for a number of his works which have become familiar signposts of Danish history and culture: scenes from the drawing-rooms and streets of Copenhagen during his younger days; the festivity and public life captured in Rome; the many representative portraits of citizens and innovators; even the monumentalist commissions for universities and the monarchy; and Martinus Rørbye (1803–1848), remembered for his genre paintings of Copenhagen, for his landscapes and for his architectural paintings, as well as for the many sketches he made during his travels to countries rarely explored at the time. Among other artists, C.A. Jensen (1792–1870) specialized almost exclusively in portraits.\n\nAt the end of the period painting style, especially in landscape art, became caught up in the political issue of the Schleswig-Holstein Question, a vital matter for Danes, but notoriously impenetrable for most others in Europe. But it was not until the 1870s when a number of young artists defied the Academy and studied in Paris that a new style embracing Realism and Impressionism began to emerge.\n\nThe art historian Niels Laurits Høyen who taught at the Academy encouraged his students to turn to landscape painting. Johan Thomas Lundbye, Christen Købke, P. C. Skovgaard, Dankvart Dreyer, Louis Gurlitt and Martinus Rørbye were among those who developed a new approach to the genre, concentrating on scenes from the Danish countryside.\n\nA new type of genre painting also emerged during the Golden Age. Interiors depicting the middle and upper classes in the right settings were a favorite motif. Portraits followed the same pattern.\n\nBertel Thorvaldsen, strongly influenced by his lengthy stay in Rome from 1797, created many internationally recognized works in his pure Neoclassical style. His breakthrough was \"Jason with the Golden Fleece\" which was highly praised by Antonio Canova and purchased by Thomas Hope, a wealthy British art collector. Other well-known works are the large Statue of Christ in Copenhagen Cathedral and the Lion Monument in Lucerne. Many of his works can be seen in Copenhagen's Thorvaldsens Museum which was not completed until 1848, four years after his death.\n\nOther contributors to sculpture in the Golden Age include Hermann Ernst Freund, whose work centred on Scandinavian gods, and Herman Wilhelm Bissen, who sculpted contemporary figures such as \"Landsoldaten\" (The Foot Soldier), a victory monument to the war of 1848–1851.\n\nDuring the Golden Age, Copenhagen in particular acquired a new look as architects inspired by neo-classicism repaired much of the damage caused by fire in 1795 and by the British bombardment of the city in 1807.\n\nBuilding on the experience of C. F. Harsdorff\nin the late 18th century, the main proponent of Classicism in the Golden age was Christian Frederik Hansen who developed a rather severe style with clean, simple forms and large, unbroken surfaces inspired by the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome. From 1800, he was in charge of all major building projects in Copenhagen where he designed the Copenhagen City Hall & Courthouse (1805–1815) on Nytorv. He was also responsible for rebuilding the Church of Our Lady (\"Vor Frue Kirke\") and designing the surrounding square (1811–1829).\n\nIn 1800, Hansen was also charged with rebuilding Christiansborg Palace which had burnt down in 1794. He worked with Gustav Friedrich Hetsch who completed the interiors. Unfortunately, the palace burnt down once again in 1884. All that remains is the magnificent chapel which, with its Ionic columns, conveys a sense of antiquity.\n\nMichael Gottlieb Bindesbøll is remembered above all for designing Thorvaldsens Museum. In 1822, as a young man, he had experienced Karl Friedrich Schinkel's classicism in Germany and France and had met the German-born architect and archaeologist Franz Gau who introduced him to the colourful architecture of antiquity. His uncle, Jonas Collin, who was an active art and culture official under Frederick VI, awakened the King's interest in a museum for Bertel Thorvaldsen, the Danish-Icelandic sculptor, and asked Bindesbøll to make some sketches for the building. As Bindensbøll's designs stood out from those of other architects, he was given a commission to transform the Royal Carriage Depot and Theatre Scenery Painting Building into a museum. Emulating the construction of the Erechtheion and the Parthenon as freestanding buildings released from the traditional urban plan of closed streets, he completed the work in 1848.\n\nAndreas Hallander and Johan Martin Quist were among those who rebuilt the houses in the older sections of Copenhagen which had been destroyed by fire.\n\nThe 19th century also saw the emergence of a number of Danish composers who were inspired by Romantic nationalism. Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann (1805–1900) contributed to song and the piano repertory as well as to opera and ballet music. From 1843 until his death, he was the organist at the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen. His works are not only romantic but generally inspired by the old Nordic legends.\n\nHans Christian Lumbye (1810–1874) was employed as the first music director at the Copenhagen amusement park Tivoli when it opened in 1843. Here he had a platform for presenting a large foreign and Danish repertory, including his many waltzes and gallops. In 1839, he had heard a Viennese orchestra play music by Johann Strauss, after which he composed in the same style, eventually earning the nickname \"The Strauss of the North\". One of his most popular pieces, associated with Tivoli, is \"Champagnegaloppen\" (the Champagne Galop), which starts with the happy sound of a champagne cork popping. It has been used in several Danish films including \"Reptilicus\" (1961), and \"Champagnegaloppen\" (1938).\nNiels W. Gade (1817–1890) participated in the development of \"Musikforeningen\" (the Music Society) which had been founded in 1836 with the purpose of extending and improving the understanding of classical music. He became its conductor in 1850, and under his management a number of masterpieces of choral music were given their first performance in Denmark, among them Bach's St. Matthew Passion in 1875. At the conservatory in Copenhagen, Gade helped teach future generations, including Edvard Grieg and Carl Nielsen. In the spirit of Romantic nationalism, he composed eight symphonies, a violin concerto, chamber music, organ and piano pieces and a number of large-scale cantatas, among them \"Elverskud\", the most famous Danish work of its kind.\n\nAnother major contributor to the music scene during the Golden Age was August Bournonville (1805–1879), the celebrated ballet master. From 1830 to 1877, he was the choreographer at the Royal Danish Ballet, for which he created more than 50 ballets admired for their exuberance, lightness, and beauty. He created a style which, although influenced by the Paris ballet, is entirely his own. Bournonville's best-known works are \"La Sylphide\" (1836), \"Napoli\" (1842), \"Le Conservatoire\" (1849), \"The Kermesse in Bruges\" (1851) and \"A Folk Tale\" (1854). He drew on a number of different composers including Holger Simon Paulli and Niels Gade. The ballets are widely performed today, not only in Denmark but worldwide, especially in the United States.\n\nDuring Denmark's Golden Age, literature centred on Romantic thinking. It was introduced in 1802 by the philosopher Henrik Steffens who gave a successful series of lectures at Elers Kollegium. He presented the main themes of German romanticism, emphasising the relationship between nature, history and mankind. The movement was maintained by the romanticists, especially Adam Oehlenschläger (1779–1850). Remembered today for his \"Digte\" (1803) and \"Poetiske Skrifter\" (1805), Oehlenschläger quickly became the leading poet in Denmark. Bernhard Severin Ingemann (1789–1862) also published a collection of romantic poems before producing first a number of plays, then a successful series of novels and finally a number of fine religious poems which, after being set to music, became an important addition to the hymns sung in Danish churches.\nOne of the most important figures in Danish literary culture was N. F. S. Grundtvig (1783–1872) who instilled a growing spirit of nationalism based initially on his \"Northern Mythology\" (1808) and his long drama, \"The Fall of the Heroic Life in the North\" (1809). In addition to a huge stream of articles and poems, he wrote a number of books, including two histories of the world (1814 and 1817), the long historical poem \"Roskilde-Riim\" (\"Rhyme of Roskilde\") (1813), and a book-sized commentary, \"Roskilde Saga\". Grundtvig's hymn book brought about a great change in Danish church services, substituting the hymns of the national poets for the slow measures of the orthodox Lutherans. In all Grundtvig wrote or translated about 1,500 hymns, including \"God's Word Is Our Great Heritage\", most of which are still frequently sung today.\nHans Christian Andersen (1805–1875) is remembered first and foremost for his fairy tales, written between 1835 and 1872 not only for children but for adults too. Among the most popular are \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\", \"The Snow Queen\", \"The Little Mermaid\", \"Thumbelina\", \"The Little Match Girl\", and \"The Ugly Duckling\". Considered to be the father of the modern fairytale, Andersen wrote a total of 156 fairy stories, only 12 of which drew on folk tales. But Andersen also wrote a number of travel sketches, several novels including the well-received: \"The Improvisatore\" (1835), a series of poems, and his autobiography \"The Fairy Tale of My Life\" (1855).\n\nDanish philosophy was dominated in the first half of the 19th century by the influence of Hegel and Hegelianism. Johan Ludvig Heiberg (1791–1860), Frederik Christian Sibbern (1785–1872), and especially Hans Lassen Martensen (1803–1884), all of whom contributed to the popularity of Hegel's idealism in various academic disciplines, though Hegel's influence significantly declined by 1850. The primary critic of Hegelianism, and the most important philosopher in Denmark at the time, was Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), an existentialist philosopher and a theologian. Much of Kierkegaard's philosophical work deals with the issues of how one lives, focusing on the priority of concrete human reality over abstract thinking and highlighting the importance of personal choice and commitment. His principal aesthetic works include Either/Or (\"Enten-Eller\") (1843), Philosophical Fragments (\"Philosophiske Smuler\") (1844), Stages on Life's Way (\"Stadier paa Livets Vei\") (1845) and Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments (\"Afsluttende uvidenskabelig Efterskrift\") (1846). Opposing Hegelian philosophy, they promote the existential approach which raises the individual's awareness of God but intensifies his despair at not being able to achieve eternal truth. His religious works include Works of Love (\"Kjerlighedens Gjerninger\") (1847) and Practice in Christianity \"(Indøvelse i Christendom)\" (1850). Another important figure in Danish philosophy was N. F. S. Grundtvig (1784–1872), whose ideas became an important part of the development of Danish national identity.\n\nOne name stands out above all others among those who contributed to science during the Danish Golden Age, that of Hans Christian Ørsted, the prominent physicist and chemist known for observing that electric currents induce magnetic fields, an important aspect of electromagnetism. He shaped post-Kantian philosophy and advances in science throughout the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1824, Ørsted founded \"Selskabet for Naturlærens Udbredelse\" (SNU), a society to disseminate knowledge of the natural sciences. He was also the founder of predecessor organizations which eventually became the Danish Meteorological Institute and the Danish Patent and Trademark Office. Ørsted was the first modern thinker to explicitly describe and name the thought experiment. He was convinced that all things in the universe were related, both materially and spiritually. He described this in his philosophical work \"Ånden i naturen\" (The Spirit in Nature).\n\nØrsted contributed strongly to the Golden Age, especially through his close friendship with Hans Christian Andersen.\n\nThe leading players in the Danish Golden Age have not only had a lasting impact in Denmark, but throughout the world. Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales have been translated into over 150 languages, more than any book apart from the Bible, and continue to be read to children everywhere.\nWith the exception of Norwegian-born Ludvig Holberg, no Danish writer before 1870 exercised so wide an influence as Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger. His work was to awaken his compatriots' enthusiasm for the poetry and religion of their ancestors, to the extent that his name remains to this day synonymous with Scandinavian romance.\n\nIn architecture, when designing the Thorvaldsen Museum, Michael Bindesbøll gave special attention to liberating the building from its surroundings. His free perception of space served as a guiding principle for the cities and buildings of the future.\n\nThe choreographer, August Bournonville, resisting many of the excesses of the romantic era ballets, gave equal emphasis to male and female roles in his work at a time when European ballet emphasized the ballerina.\n\nN. F. S. Grundtvig exerted considerable influence on education, promoting a spirit of freedom, poetry and disciplined creativity. Opposing compulsion and examinations, he advocated unleashing human creativity according to the universally creative order of life. A spirit of freedom, cooperation and discovery was to be kindled in individuals, in science, and in society as a whole. Søren Kierkegaard has also strongly influenced philosophy and literature right up to the present day. Among the many who have profited from his ideas are Jean-Paul Sartre, Niels Bohr and W. H. Auden.\n\nHans Christian Ørsted's scientific advances contributed fundamentally to chemistry, with his work on aluminium, and especially to physics, with his conclusive research on electromagnetism.\n\nFinally, many of the works of the painters and sculptors of the period continue to be exhibited in the world's finest museums and galleries. Some, like Christen Købke, have attracted renewed interest in recent years.\n"}

It was the first game to be developed by Zipper Interactive.\n\nThe game takes place in 2057, where crime is rampant and jails are overpopulated. The government forms the Committee of Recreational Termination (C.O.R.T.) in order to eliminate the surplus of convicts. In this competition, convicts must take part in deathmatches in which one will survive and be declared winner.\n\n\"GameSpot\" called \"DeathDrome\" \"one of the best games of its kind to arrive on the scene in quite some time.\" He particularly praised the creative weapons and the tension created by having the \"scrub\" mechanic instead of the game immediately ending when time runs out. He remarked that the fact that enemies always spawn at the center podium is too easily exploited in single-player mode, but felt the main draw is the multiplayer mode in any case. \"Next Generation\" also noted the creative weapons and \"truly hairbreadth escapes\" as time runs out as the highlights. He also complimented how the developers maintained a decent frame rate by dividing the arenas into four sections.

{"id": "10550623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10550623", "title": "Dragon Warrior Monsters", "text": "Dragon Warrior Monsters\n\nDragon Warrior Monsters is the first video game in the \"Dragon Quest Monsters\" series. It was released in Japan by Enix on September 25, 1998, and co-published by Eidos Interactive in Europe and North America in 2000. It was the first \"Dragon Quest\" game to be released in Europe. It was released for the Game Boy Color before the console itself was released; however, the cartridge is backward compatible with the older Game Boy console in black-and-white color. The game was remade for the PlayStation in a compilation Dragon Quest Monsters 1+2 Hoshi Furi no Yūsha to Bokujō no Nakamatachi. A mobile phone incarnation titled \"Dragon Quest Monsters i\" was released in Japan on January 28, 2002.\n\nThe game features the characters Terry and Milly from \"\" when they were children, before the events in \"Dragon Quest VI\". \"Dragon Warrior Monsters\" is often compared to the \"Pokémon\" series due to their similar gameplay. Critics set the games apart by noting the in-depth breeding system seen in this game.\n\nIn May 2012, a remake of the game for the Nintendo 3DS, titled Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry no Wonderland 3D, was released. Later in November 2018, the remake was released for smartphones\n\nThe game follows Terry as he attempts to save his sister. Instead of fighting in battle, Terry is able to recruit monsters into his party. When fighting random battles, Terry can set out meat, which may coax the monster into joining the party at the end of the battle. Terry can also breed two monsters, combining them into a new, stronger monster. Excess monsters can be placed on the Farm, a storage place for monsters. They can be picked up or dropped off and there is an option to put monsters at the farm to sleep, which allows them to maintain their wilderness level, but not grow in level. There can be 19 awake and 19 asleep monsters at any one time. A monster's wilderness level lowers as Terry trains them, which makes them more likely to participate in battle. By leaving monsters at the farm awake, they become more wild.\n\nJust like in most RPGs, monsters are able to gain experience points and level up after battles. Each monsters' requirements for experience points to level up varies, depending on their plus number or even what monster family they belong to. When they level up, they gain stats and sometimes skills. All monsters can carry a maximum of eight skills; if a monster can gain more than eight skills you have the option of replacing old skills with new ones.\n\nThe player moves around to other worlds through warp gates which are located underneath the throne room. To access these gates, the player needs to defeat a certain class ranking. There are a certain number of areas in a world and at the last one, the player needs to defeat a boss. Some bosses in the game offer to join the player's party automatically, some have to be won over with meat, and some will not join at all. Other gates are hidden throughout Great Tree, such as one in the library that is only accessible after befriending over 100 different monsters.\n\nIn this game the player fights in the arena and goes through ranks that consists of three different battles that must be won before the player can advance to the next ranking. Each rank provides harder challenges: the higher the rank, the harder the monsters. The battles you able to start at are from Rank G and go to Rank D and later in the game you are able to go from Rank C to Rank A and then Rank S. These battles open up gates for the character to explore and are necessary to progress through the story.\n\nTiny Medals are scattered throughout different worlds randomly and are picked up by the player. In the game, there is a man who collects these medals, who is later revealed to be the king of Great Tree, and will give certain monster eggs for how many the player gives to him. Also, Foreign Masters may appear while in other worlds. These encounters with other trainers can result in battle. There are different types of trainers that will give or do something for the player if they are defeated. These trainers monsters may also join you if you give them meat.\n\nThe game also comes compatible with the PlayStation's i-mode adaptor, allowing players to upload monsters from the game onto the mobile phone version of \"Dragon Quest Monsters\".\n\nAfter beating Class F in the Arena, the player can breed monsters if they are at level 10 or above at the Shrine of Starry Night, which is taken care of by the current Master Monster Tamer. Breeding requires one male and one female monster. The result of the breeding will be an egg, containing a level 1 monster which has characteristics of both parents, including skills and stats. The egg can then be left in the monster farm or hatched, which costs a small fee. The monster born will have a plus number next to it, the number generally signifying the greatness of the monster's stats, the higher being the better. It costs more money to hatch a monster with a higher plus number than one with no plus number. Also, the number beside the plus multiplied by two is added to the limit for the maximum level for the monster.\n\nOnce the Egg Evaluator is available for use, eggs can have the gender of the monster they're containing checked and changed. Both requires a small fee which is paid to the Egg Evaluator. The fee increases depending on the monster's plus number.\n\nA monster that was created through breeding has much higher stats and many more abilities than a monster that was found in the wild, thus it is much harder to complete the game without breeding many generations. Breeding is also the only way to acquire certain monsters. Also, the monsters that bred to make the egg leave you.\n\nIn the days before \"\", when Terry and Milly were just children, a strange monster appeared one night and snatched Milly away. Soon after, another monster, similar to the kidnapper, appeared and told Terry his sister was kidnapped by the evil Warubou. He informs Terry that his name is Watabou and must accompany him to the Kingdom of GreatTree. After his arrival, Terry met the King and received Slib the slime, his first monster to train. If Terry wins the Monster Trainer's Starry Night Tournament, he will be granted a wish. So Terry sets out with his team to explore the many monster dungeons to win the tournament and rescue his sister.\n\nThe Nintendo 3DS remake was announced in September 2011 by publisher Square Enix, and was said to include new monsters, a new story, and additional monsters from \" Professional\".\n\nThe game features include shifting from day to night, randomized dungeon layouts, combat with four opponents on each side, and a total of 609 monsters, including all the monsters from the original Game Boy Color release. The game also features an in-game Wi-Fi Store in the bazaar area. The Wi-Fi Store purchases can be made with the in-game currency, gold. The store's items changes daily, and the Wi-Fi item store is only open after doing that day's Wi-Fi Ranking Battle. It can be used to buy monster eggs, (white, silver, and rainbow eggs) skill books, consumable items, and some weapons. Players have the ability to import monsters they have raised from \"\" and\n\" Professional\" (Rank A and higher only) through a free app upon completion of the game. At that point, players can access \"Ultimate Combination\", where new abilities become available for the players monsters, and the ability to create \"super monsters\" is possible. X and XY monsters (+, and +* in the original Japanese version) in Joker 2/Professional could be obtained by synthesizing 2 of the same monsters, level 20 for X, and level 50 for XY monsters. However, the method to create them is different in Terry's Wonderland 3D. Both duplicate monsters of different gender have to have their monster's rank points +25 for + monsters, and +50 for +* monsters. In Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland 3D, there is a +, and +* for every monster, while in Joker 2/Professional not every monster had them. After synthesizing a few of these monsters, a new synth will happen immediately afterwards, making a demon book monster that knows said monsters skills. There are more than a few kinds of demon book monsters ranging from small size to large size monsters. Using the StreetPass feature of the Nintendo 3DS, players can fight other players and attempt to steal their monsters. Miis are also utilized in the game, allowing players to customize their character's clothing. Online play is supported, including \"Grand Prix\" mode for a maximum of eight players.\n\nIn B3 of the Great Tree, one of the two gates there takes you to an arena where you can battle the top 3 users who've won that day's ranking battle. You can do auto commands, AI battle tactics, and use items. The users are AIs, and their data are recorded from said day's ranking battle. You get both bonus points (for Wi-Fi Ranking Battle) and gold. The other gate there takes you to a 100 battle survival course. After 50 battles, it auto saves. If you lose between 51-100, you get to start back at battle 50. These battles can only be done once every 24 hours.\n\nIn Japan, \"Dragon Warrior Monsters\" sold 2.35 million copies, of which 1.22 million were sold during 1998—making it the fourth-highest selling game of the year. The North American version sold 60,000 copies by April 2000.\n\n\"Dragon Warrior Monsters\" received mostly positive reviews, receiving an average score of 78.9% from GameRankings based on 12 reviews. The game was compared to \"Pokémon\" by critics because of its similar gameplay, many telling fans to play the game as a means of waiting for the release of \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\". GameSpot.com praised the game's visuals, music, and gameplay, stating that the game \"may not have the cutesy, over-merchandised appeal of Pokémon, but the rock-solid gameplay makes it a worthwhile endeavor.\" IGN stated that \"Dragon Warrior Monsters\" features many of \"Pokémon's\" mechanics, \"but better,\" commenting on the game's large cast of monsters and battles. However, IGN also made a distinction between the two games, saying that \"Pokémon's\" ability to capture any wild Pokémon with a Poké Ball as opposed to taming monsters was a better idea.\n\nRPGFan.com reviewed the game, mentioning that the game's 215 monsters gave the game a large amount of depth, and that the \"bulk and the most fun aspect of the game is catching monsters and breeding them to get more powerful monsters.\" Gaming-Age.com similarly pointed out that the breeding aspect of \"Dragon Warrior Monsters\" set it apart from other monster-catching games, noting that its monsters \"don't quite have the extra 'omph' that the creatures do\", but that \"none of the creatures are so super cutesy that they begin to get on your nerves.\"\n\nPlayStation compilation \"Dragon Quest Monsters 1+2\" received a 33 out of 40 by \"Famitsu\" magazine. The game was the 38th best-selling game of 2002 with 292,275 copies.\n\nThe Nintendo 3DS remake has been sold 513,000 copies in the first week. Publisher Square Enix sold through 93.96 percent of their stock and several stores sold out of product. A special version of the Nintendo 3DS bundled with the game also sold 100,000 units in the first week. As of January 2013, the game has 920,000 copies. As a promotion, fast food franchise McDonald's gave away a Slanin Purple on May 31, 2012 in Happy Meals to those who had copies of the game, and on June 9 they gave away Lamia, a monster from \"Dragon Warrior III\". The promotion ended June 21, 2012. Convenience stores and other establishments in Japan also gave away monsters, including a dimension traveling dragon, a Gold Killing Machine, and Tyranoosaura Wrecks from \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2881665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2881665", "title": "Edmonton Investors Group", "text": "Edmonton Investors Group\n\nThe Edmonton Investors Group Limited Partnership (EIGLP) was the limited partnership that owned the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League and the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League. With more than thirty individual shareholders, EIGLP was the largest ownership group in the NHL. Among the four North American major sports leagues, only the Green Bay Packers have a larger ownership group.\n\nThe EIG were the key players for keeping the Edmonton Oilers in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada long term by purchasing the team from then-owner Peter Pocklington for 107 million ($ in Canadian dollars) and preventing the team by being purchasing the team for US$90 million ($ in American dollars) or C$127 million ($ in Canadian dollars).\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Edmonton Oilers owner Peter Pocklington was in a precarious financial situation. Pocklington's main creditor, the Alberta Treasury Branches, were demanding repayment of millions of dollars' worth of loans that ATB had made to Pocklington in the 1980s and early 1990s. The once-popular Pocklington had a strained relationship with Edmontonians due in part to his decision to trade Wayne Gretzky as well as his other business and political dealings. As a result, attendance at Northlands Coliseum had declined – partly due to the team's declining on-ice fortunes but also due to personal animosity towards the owner.\n\nThis animosity hindered a 1996 season ticket drive that was needed to keep the team in Edmonton. It was largely due to the perseverance of future EIG partner Cal Nichols, that the \"Friends of the Oilers\" ticket drive ultimately expanded the season ticket base from a dismal 6,200 to over 13,400, enough to secure the team's future for the short term. However, it was increasingly obvious that Pocklington would not be around for the long term. In early 1997, Pocklington announced his intention to sell up to 45% of the team on the stock market. Pressure from ATB forced him to abandon this plan and put the team up for sale.\n\nWhen the Oilers were put up for sale, many doubted whether a local ownership could be found and believed the proud franchise would be re-located to an American city as had happened with the teams in Quebec City in 1995 and Winnipeg in 1996. In 1997, the population of the Edmonton metropolitan area was still under one million, a figure viewed by many fans to be the minimum base a North American major sports team needs to be financially viable. With the only other former World Hockey Association team in Hartford re-locating in 1997, many analysts predicted that the \"domino effect\" would be completed in 1998 with the Oilers' move.\n\nHowever, the terms of Pocklington's lease at what was then known as the Edmonton Coliseum prevented him from unilaterally moving the team or selling it to someone who intended to move it. It stipulated that an ownership group willing to keep the team in Edmonton would have six weeks from the time any such intention was declared to purchase the team for US$70 million. In addition, the ATB is a crown corporation owned by the Alberta government, though they treated the matter as non-political. While Alberta Premier Ralph Klein wanted to keep the Oilers in the capital, he was wary of a series of scandals involving favouritism at the ATB that had plagued his predecessor, Don Getty, in the 1980s. Klein was unwilling to make any move that might have been perceived by voters as government subsidization of a hockey club that paid multimillion-dollar salaries. However, when Klein's hometown Calgary Flames encountered financial difficulties in 2000, he immediately moved to assist them by creating a province-wide lottery.\n\nNichols, a prominent businessman in his own right, immediately began putting together an ownership group. At the time, the Albertan economy—driven by the oilpatch—was still recovering from price crashes in the 1980s and 1990s. Most Albertan investors preferred to commit their money to the re-emerging oilpatch, not a \"small-market\" hockey team. With no single Albertan magnate willing to commit C$100 million to purchase the team, Nichols was forced to secure smaller investments from a larger number of investors. Lenders were willing to finance 40% of the purchase price, meaning Nichols needed to come up with about C$60 million. Nichols had about C$35 million in investments when an offer of US$85 million (C$120 million) came from a buyer who wanted to move the team to Houston.\n\nThe Oilers' sale attracted interest in from several American cities, and as Nichols was securing local investors, an offer of US$85 million (C$120 million) came from Leslie Alexander, a Houston-based businessman and an owner of the National Basketball Association's Houston Rockets. Houston, who's application for an expansion team rejected by the league, was (and still is) the largest U.S. city without an NHL franchise. Alexander's original offer was to keep the team in Edmonton on the condition that the lease be terminated, attendance remained at acceptable levels, a local ownership group was eventually found and an expansion team be granted to Alexander in Houston. The Edmonton City Council rejected these terms, believing they gave Alexander too much discretion to move the Oilers to Texas. The city believed the lease they negotiated with Pocklington was still the best chance they had of keeping the team in Edmonton in the long term. Alexander then offered the ATB (which had the team in receivership by then) US$85 million (C$120 million) to purchase the team and move it to Houston, and submitted a US$5 million (C$7 million) deposit. Nichols was given until March 13, 1998 to match the deposit and commit to purchasing the team for US$70 million (C$100 million), or the lease would be automatically terminated and the team would move.\n\nNichols was eventually able to assemble a group of 38 local investors. As the deadline neared, the Edmonton Investors Group (EIG) decided to commit to the purchase by matching Alexander's deposit with a down payment of US$5 million (C$7 million). The remainder of the US$70 million (C$100 million) was paid to ATB 40 days later. On May 5, 1998, the NHL approved the sale and the EIG officially become the NHL owners. Although major sporting leagues generally frown upon large ownership groups controlling franchises, the NHL decided to forego putting a team in Houston and allow the Oilers' sale to EIG to proceed as they did not want to lose any more Canadian teams – this would have put their lucrative Canadian television contracts in jeopardy.\n\nThe Edmonton Investors Group Ltd. is mainly a local ownership group, but includes a few business people from outside the city as well. The Oilers sale even drew interest from Calgary-born comic book creator Todd McFarlane, creator of the famous Spawn character. McFarlane and artist Brent Ashe later designed the Oilers’ third jersey.\n\nThe Oilers' new owners have maintained good relations with fans. As a result, fans in Edmonton backed the league-imposed lockout of 2004–05, which wiped out an entire season, and came back after the lockout was settled. In the 2005–06 NHL season, the Oilers sold out every home game except one, where a computer glitch prevented the release of several hundred tickets.\n\nFollowing a successful 2005–06 season which saw the Oilers fall one win short of winning the Stanley Cup and a boom in the Albertan economy, fan support reached its highest levels. A waiting list for season ticket buyers, unheard of during the days of Pocklington's ownership, was put in place after the owners were compelled to cap the number of season tickets sold. The team has also announced that a lottery will be held for the right to purchase multi-game packages at Rexall Place.\n\nIn the 2006–07 NHL season the Oilers sold out every home game for the first time, despite missing the playoffs by a substantial margin. The ownership group then reportedly received a C$145 million ($ in dollars) offer from local billionaire Daryl Katz for the franchise, although Nichols subsequently said the team was not for sale. Daryl Katz upped the offer to C$150 million ($ in dollars), but was turned down again.\n\nOn August 7, Daryl Katz made a 3rd offer for the team of C$185 million ($ in dollars). Cal Nichols, spokesman for the EIG, said it amounted to a hostile takeover, and had caused divisions within the EIG.\n\nOn December 13, 2007 Daryl Katz submitted a 4th formal offer to the EIG to buy the franchise. The offer was C$188 million ($ in dollars) to the EIG shareholders, plus another $100 million towards the building of a new arena in downtown Edmonton, as well as a new state of the art training facility located at the University of Alberta. Cal Nichols indicated that he would accept the offer for his share of the team, but that the EIG had to have the owners of 2/3 of the shares agree to the proposal. Cal Nichols resigned as chairman of the board of directors for the EIG on December 14, 2007. Assuming the position of chairman of the board was Bill Butler, a minority shareholder & real estate developer. The EIG met to decide on the bid January 21, 2008.\n\nBefore the January 21st meeting there were rumours of a rival or plan B offer led by Gary Gregg, Bill Butler, Brian Nilsson and Jakob Ambrosius. These rumours were confirmed on January 23, as the rival faction would match the Katz offer either by soliciting new shareholders or taking a loan from Scotiabank using the hockey club as collateral.\n\nAs reported on the Team 1260 on January 24, 2008 as well as in the Edmonton Journal on January 25, 3 more directors of the Edmonton Investors Group stepped down. Ron Hodgson, Neal Allen & Brian Hryniuk have resigned adding speculation that they may have accepted the Katz offer as well. The updated price per share is C$20,687 ($ in dollars) & sources close to Daryl Katz said he may be willing to close the deal only having 60% of the 7492 EIG shares.\n\nOn June 18, 2008 it was reported that the sale of the Edmonton Oilers was approved to Daryl Katz for a reported C$200 million ($ in dollars).\n\nThe ownership of the EIG was as follows (investors on the board of directors in BOLD):\n\n\"*Purchased shares of Dick Colf in 2002\"<br>\n\"**Inherited shares of Wally Kuchar (1925-2004) in 2004\"<br>\n\"***Sold shares to EIG in 2003\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2084367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084367", "title": "Epic film", "text": "Epic film\n\nEpic films are a style of filmmaking with large scale, sweeping scope, and spectacle. The usage of the term has shifted over time, sometimes designating a film genre and at other times simply synonymous with big budget filmmaking. Like epics in the classical literary sense it is often focused on a heroic character. An epic's ambitious nature helps to set it apart from other types of film such as the period piece or adventure film.\n\nEpic historical films would usually take a historical or a mythical event and add an extravagant setting and lavish costumes, accompanied by an expansive musical score with an ensemble cast, which would make them among the most expensive of films to produce. The most common subjects of epic films are royalty, and important figures from various periods in world history.\n\nThe term \"epic\" originally came from the poetic genre exemplified by such works as the \"Iliad\", \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", or the \"Odyssey\". In classical literature, epics are considered works focused on deeds or journeys of heroes upon which the fate of a large number of people depend. Similarly, films described as \"epic\" typically take a historical character, or a mythic heroic figure. Common subjects of epics are royalty, gladiators, great military leaders, or leading personalities from various periods in world history. However, there are some films described as \"epic\" almost solely on the basis of their enormous scope and the sweeping panorama of their settings such as \"How the West Was Won\" or \"East of Eden\" that do not have the typical substance of classical epics but are directed in an epic style.\n\nWhen described as \"epic\" because of content, an epic movie is often set during a time of war or other societal crisis, while usually covering a longer span of time sometimes throughout entire generations coming and passing away, in terms of both the events depicted and the running time of the film. Such films usually have a historical setting, although fantasy or science fiction settings have become common in recent decades. The central conflict of the film is usually seen as having far-reaching effects, often changing the course of history. The main characters' actions are often central to the resolution of the societal conflict.\n\nIn its classification of films by genre, the American Film Institute limits the genre to historical films such as \"Ben-Hur\". However, film scholars such as Constantine Santas are willing to extend the label to science-fiction films such as \"\" and \"Star Wars\". Lynn Ramey suggests that \"Surely one of the hardest film genres to define is that of the \"epic\" film, encompassing such examples as \"Ben-Hur\", \"Gone with the Wind\"...and more recently, \"300\" and the \"Star Wars\" films...none of these comes from literary epics \"per se\", and there is little that links them with one another. Among those who espouse film genre studies, epic is one of the most despised and ignored genres\" Finally, although the \"American Movie Channel\" formally defines epic films as historical films, they nonetheless state the epic film may be combined with the genre of science-fiction and cite \"Star Wars\" as an example.\n\nStylistically, films classed as epic usually employ spectacular settings and specially designed costumes, often accompanied by a sweeping musical score, and an ensemble cast of bankable stars. Epics are usually among the most expensive of films to produce. They often use on-location filming, authentic period costumes, and action scenes on a massive scale. Biographical films may be less lavish versions of this genre.\n\nMany writers may refer to any film that is \"long\" (over two hours) as an epic, making the definition epic a matter of dispute, and raise questions as to whether it is a \"genre\" at all. As Roger Ebert put it, in his \"Great Movies\" article on \"Lawrence of Arabia\":\n\nThe comedy film \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" had the joking tagline \"Makes \"Ben-Hur\" look like an epic.\"\n\nThe epic is among the oldest of film genres, with one early notable example being Giovanni Pastrone's \"Cabiria\", a three-hour silent film, about the Punic Wars, that laid the groundwork for the subsequent silent epics of D. W. Griffith.\n\nThe genre reached a peak of popularity in the early 1960s, when Hollywood frequently collaborated with foreign film studios (such as Rome's Cinecittà) to use relatively exotic locations in Spain, Morocco, and elsewhere for the production of epic films such as \"El Cid\" (1961) or \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962). This boom period of international co-productions is generally considered to have ended with \"Cleopatra\" (1963), \"The Fall of the Roman Empire\" (1964), and \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965). Nevertheless, films in this genre continued to appear, with one notable example being \"War and Peace\", which was released in the former Soviet Union during 1967-1968 and, directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, and said to be the most expensive film ever made.\n\nEpic films continue to be produced, although since the development of CGI they typically use computer effects instead of an actual cast of thousands. Since the 1950s, such films have regularly been shot with a wide aspect ratio for a more immersive and panoramic theatrical experience.\n\nEpic films were recognized in a montage at the 2006 Academy Awards.\n\nThe enduring popularity of the epic is often accredited to their ability to appeal to a wide audience. Many of the highest-grossing films of all-time have been epics. The 1997 film \"Titanic\", which is cited as helping to revive the genre, grossed $658 million domestically and over $2.1 billion worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of all-time behind the 2009 film \"Avatar\", another epic which grossed $2.7 billion worldwide. If inflation is taken into account, then the historical epic \"Gone with the Wind\" becomes the highest-grossing film ever in the United States. Adjusted for inflation it earned the equivalent of $1.6 billion in the United States alone. Adjusted for ticket price inflation, the science fiction/fantasy epic \"Star Wars\" stands at number 2, with an inflated gross of $1.4 billion in the United States.\n\nSo far the most Academy Awards ever won by a single film stands at 11. This feat has only been achieved by 3 movies (\"Ben-Hur\", \"Titanic\" and \"\") all of which are considered epics.\n\n\n"}

It is the sequel to the 2004 game \"FlatOut\".\n\nThis game is themed more on the street racing/import tuner scene than its predecessor. A notable change is the tire grip; players can take more control of their car, worrying less about skidding in tight turns. The game has three car classes: derby, race, and street.\n\nIt was released in Russia on June 29, 2006, in Europe on June 30, 2006, and in North America on August 1, 2006 In 2008, an OS X version of the game was released by Virtual Programming In 2014, a Linux version of the game was released on GOG.com as part of the launch of Linux support.\n\nThe ragdoll physics in the sequel have been greatly updated. During the race, the driver may be thrown out of the car if slammed into a wall at a high speed. In the numerous Stunt minigames the goal is to shoot yourself out of the car and complete objectives like knocking down a set of bowling pins, hitting the designated spots on a dartboard, score a field goal or fly through flaming hoops. Players must use 'aerobatics' to control the driver in-flight, but overusing it will increase drag, which will slow the driver down and possibly prevent him/her from reaching the designated target. If the driver falls short of the target, players can use the \"nudge\". This gives the driver a small upward boost and slightly reduces drag. In the Stone Skipping Stunt minigame, the players must use nudge just as the driver hits the surface of the water to skip the most efficiently and reach the furthest.\n\nIn 2008, the game was re-released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable with additional features and a new soundtrack, under the new name \"\" for the Xbox 360 and PC, and \"FlatOut: Head On\" for the PSP.\n\nThe PC version of \"FlatOut 2\" received \"generally favorable reviews\", while the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions received \"average\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the PS2 version a score of all four sevens for a total of 28 out of 40.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "147732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147732", "title": "Japanese traditional dance", "text": "Japanese traditional dance\n\nJapanese traditional dance has a long history, the oldest known ones may be among those transmitted through the \"kagura\" tradition, or folk dances relating to food producing activities such as planting rice (\"dengaku\") and fishing, including rain dances. There are large number of these traditional dances, which are often subfixed -\"odori\", -\"asobi\", and -\"mai\", and may be specific to a region or village. \"Mai\" and \"Odori\" are the two main groups of Japanese dances, and the term \"Buyō\" (舞踊) was coined in modern times as a general term for \"dance\", by combining \"mai\" (舞, which can also be pronounced \"bu\") and \"odori\" (踊, can also be pronounced \"yō\").\n\n\"Mai\" is a more reserved genre of dance that often has circling movements, and dances of the Noh theatre are of this tradition. A variation of the \"Mai\" style of Japanese dance is the Kyomai or Kyoto-style dance. Kyomai developed in the 17th century Tokugawa cultural period. It is heavily influenced by the elegance and sophistication of the manners often associated with the Imperial Court in Kyoto. \"Odori\" has more vigorous stepping movements and is more energetic, and dances of the kabuki theatre belong to this category.\n\nThere are several types of traditional Japanese dance..\n\n is a classical Japanese dance-drama. Kabuki theatre is known for the stylization of its drama and for the elaborate make-up worn by some of its performers.\n\nThe individual kanji characters, from left to right, mean \"sing\" (歌), \"dance\" (舞), and \"skill\" (伎). Kabuki is therefore sometimes translated as \"the art of singing and dancing\". These are, however, \"ateji\" characters which do not reflect actual etymology. The kanji of 'skill' generally refers to a performer in kabuki theatre. Since the word \"kabuki\" is believed to derive from the verb \"kabuku\", meaning \"to lean\" or \"to be out of the ordinary\", \"kabuki\" can be interpreted as \"avant-garde\" or \"bizarre\" theatre. The expression \"kabukimono\" (歌舞伎者) referred originally to those who were bizarrely dressed and swaggered on a street.\n\nThe history of kabuki began in 1603, when Izumo no Okuni, possibly a miko of Izumo Taisha, began performing a new style of dance drama in the dry riverbeds of Kyoto, and they were then called \"strange\" or \"unusual\" (Kabuki). This new form of dance drama is thought to have been derived from folk-dances performed only by women, \"Furyū-ō Odori\" and \"Nembu Odori\". Kabuki became a common form of entertainment in the ukiyo, or Yoshiwara, the registered red-light district in Edo. During the Genroku era, kabuki thrived. The structure of a kabuki play was formalized during this period, as were many elements of style. Conventional character types were established,the types were established because of the emperor at the time Kharun the worshiped.\n\nThe origin of the Noh Mai can be traced back to as far as the thirteenth century. Noh Mai is a dance that is done to music that is made by flutes and small hand drums. At some points they dance to vocal and percussion music, these points are called kuse or kiri. Noh Mai dances are put together by a series of forms. Forms are patterns of body movements that are done elegantly and with beauty.\n\nThere are several types of Noh Mai dances. A type that is neither slow nor fast is called Chu No Mai. A female usually performs this type of dance. A slower type of dance is the Jo No Mai. A female does this dance as well and can dress up as either a ghost of a noble woman, a spirit or deity. A male’s dance is Otoko Mai. The performer does not wear a mask in this dance and is portraying the character as being heroic. Another male dance is Kami Mai, where the dancer acts as though he is a deity. This is a very fast dance. The female version of this would be Kagura and can be performed in various ways. Gaku is a dance that is imitates music played by the imperial court and is usually done by the main character. These six types make up the Noh Mai dance and help give the dance its beauty.\n\nCostumes are a huge part of Noh Mai. Sometimes a dance or play may start out very slowly, so the actors create very flamboyant costumes to keep the audience interested. They also dress to fit the region in which they represent, such as a bamboo hat worn during a play would represent country life. The most important part of the costume is the mask. The Noh Mai masks are thought to be the most artistic masks in Japan. The masks are only worn by the main characters. Also, the masks have neutral expressions so it is the job of the actor to bring the character to life.\n\nNihon Buyō is different from most other traditional dances. It is intended for entertainment on stage. Nihon Buyō is a refined dance that has been improved throughout four centuries. There are four parts to Nihon Buyō, the most significant part being Kabuki Buyō. Nihon Buyō was created directly from Kabuki Buyō before it became theater. The second part of Nihon Buyō is Noh. Nihon Buyō takes a few key elements from Noh such as the circular movements and the tools used in its dances. The third part of these dances comes from the folk dances; the spinning and jumping used in folk dances was incorporated into Nihon Buyō. The last part came from a mixture of European and American culture that is found in Japan today. Today, with the combination of these dances we have Nihon Buyō, a refined dance that has become an art form made for entertainment on stage.\n\nThere are a wide variety of folk dances in Japan. Folk dances are often the basis from which other dance forms developed. An example of a Japanese folk dance is the is a dance based upon the fluttering movements of the Eurasian tree sparrow. It was first performed, improvised, by stonemasons who were constructing Sendai Castle for the \"daimyō\" Date Masamune. The emblem of the Date clan incorporates two tree sparrows. The sparrow dance is now performed yearly in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture at the Aoba festival in mid-May. School children in Miyagi prefecture learn and perform the sparrow dance, especially during the Obon Festival.\n\nBon Odori is a type of folk dance performed during the Obon Festival Obon. It was originally a dance to welcome the spirits of the dead. These dances and the music that accompanies them are different for every region of Japan. Usually, the bon dance involves people dancing around a yagura, a high wooden scaffold. The people move either counter clockwise or clockwise, away and towards the yagura. Sometimes they switch direction.\n\nThe movements and gestures in a bon dance often depict the history, work or geography of the region. For example, Tankō Bushi is a coal mining work song that originates from Miike Mine in Kyushu, and the movements in the dance depict digging, cart pushing and lantern hanging. Soran Bushi is a sea shanty, and the movements in the dance depict net dragging and luggage hoisting. Bon dances may employ the use of different utensils, such as fans, small towels and wooden hand clappers. For the Hanagasa Odori, the dancers use straw hats with flowers on them.Is a dance that is a dance\n\n\n"}

One year after graduating from high school, he studied in a college in Strasbourg, France, then at the École des arts décoratifs in the same town.\n\nHe is best known for his work based on J. R. R. Tolkien's worlds. Howe and Tolkien artist Alan Lee served as chief conceptual designers for Peter Jackson's \"The Lord of the Rings\" movie trilogy, and Howe also did the illustration for the \"Lord of the Rings\" board game created by Reiner Knizia. Howe also re-illustrated the maps of \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"The Hobbit\", and \"The Silmarillion\" in 1996–2003. His work is however not limited to this, and includes images of myths such as the Anglo Saxon legend of Beowulf (he also illustrated Knizia's board game \"\"). Howe illustrated many other books, amongst which many belong to the fantasy genre (Robin Hobb's books for instance.) He also contributed to the film adaptation of \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" by C. S. Lewis. In 2005 a limited edition of George R. R. Martin's novel \"A Clash of Kings\" was released by Meisha Merlin, complete with numerous illustrations by Howe.\n\nHowe has illustrated cards for the \"\" collectible card game.\n\nFor \"The Hobbit\" films, original director Guillermo del Toro and replacement director Peter Jackson both consulted with Howe and fellow conceptual artist Alan Lee to ensure continuity of design.\n\nHowe is a member of the living history group the Company of Saynt George, and has considerable expertise in ancient and medieval armour and armaments.\n\nJohn Howe was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was drawing from pre-school age, with his mother's help. Around primary school age he found his mother's ability no longer living up to his expectations, and even got frustrated once at both his mother and himself at not being able to draw a cow to his expectations. Howe's school years were complicated by moves which took place with a timing that left the art classes full, and left him in classes like power mechanics. He did find his ability as a draughtsman to be profitable in biology class though, where he and a friend would produce renderings of microscopic organisms for classmates at fifty cents each. As a child, he collected the covers of paperbacks. His collection included items from Frank Frazetta, Barry Smith, and Bernie Wrightson. In his adolescence, Howe read \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. He said he got \"a real spark\" from the Hildebrandt calendars, which showed him that the books could be illustrated. Howe made drawings of his own versions of the scenes depicted in the calendar. These drawings, according to Howe, may not have survived.\n\nA year after his high school graduation, Howe found himself in Strasbourg, France attending college. The following year, he enrolled into the École des arts décoratifs. He cites his experience of this period as follows:\n\nThroughout his first years in Europe, Howe was taking in as much as he could in the way of art, architecture and everything that was \"simultaneously ancient and novel.\" He says the only piece of his art work that survived from this period is his \"The Lieutenant of the Black Tower of Barad-dûr\", a piece inspired by Tolkien's, \"The Lord of the Rings\". He says if this is not his first published piece, it must certainly be the earliest. Howe's earliest commissions included political cartoons, magazine illustrations, comics, animated films, advertising, of which he says were nightmares. He said that he would end up redoing sketches so many times that there was nothing left of \"his\" in them. This frustrated him, and he wondered how he would ever make it in the profession.\n\nProjects in which Howe worked include \"The Lord of the Rings\", J.R.R. Tolkien's Books and Merchandise, \"Beowulf\", Robin Hobb's books, \"\", Cards for \"\", \"The Hobbit\", \"Pan's Labyrinth\". Howe has also written and illustrated children's books.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30404798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30404798", "title": "Moments (poem)", "text": "Moments (poem)\n\nMoments () is the title of a text wrongly attributed to Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. It was widely spread through articles, compilations, posters and email chain letters, mainly in Spanish.\n\nSpanish versions, with some variations, consist of a first person narrated poem about an 85-year-old person who regrets not having enjoyed some simple pleasures during his life and instead having focused on safety and correctness. \n\nThe vocabulary, syntax and style do not match those of Borges.\n\nThe first known version of the text was authored by American humorist and cartoonist Don Herold, and published by College Humor before 1935, or perhaps early that year, under the title \"I'd Pick More Daisies\". Herold's text is in prose, and it lacks the melancholic tone of the Spanish poem. E.g.:\n\nIf I had my life to live over, I'd try to make more mistakes next time. I would relax. I would limber up. I would be sillier than I have been this trip. I know of very few things that I would take seriously. I would be crazier. I would be less hygienic. I would take more chances. I would take more trips. I would climb more mountains and swim more rivers. I would burn up more gasoline. I would eat more ice cream and less bran.\n\nHerold published a revised version in the October 1953 number of Reader's Digest.\n\nAnother English version, attributed to one Nadine Stair or Nadine Strain, starts: \n\nIf I Had My Life to Live Over I'd dare to make more mistakes next time. I'd relax, I would limber up. I would be sillier than I have been this trip. I would take fewer things seriously. I would take more chances. I would climb more mountains and swim more rivers. I would eat more ice cream and less beans.This version, supposedly written by Nadine Stair, is the most common version in North America. However it is doubtful that Nadine Stair ever existed. Just how Nadine Stair came to attributed as the author is unknown. Nonetheless, what is known, is that Sandar Martz produced an anthology of poems dealing with women and aging . In this anthology she attributes Don Herold's poem, with some modifications, to a certain Nadine Stair. This was likely done because the anthology was sold as being written by women, for women—and consequently, a poem written by a man would not have appealed to female readers. \n\nOne of the most spread Spanish versions wrongly attributed to Borges starts with the following verses:\n\nSpanish versions with the shape of a poem were wrongly attributed to Borges by literary magazines like Mexican \"Plural\" (May 1989, pages 4–5) and books (such as Elena Poniatowska's \"Todo México\", page 144).\n\nOn December 2005, Irish pop singer Bono, read in Spanish some of the lines of the poem on Mexican TV show Teletón México 2005 and attributed them to the \"Chilean poet Borges.\" \n\nThe attribution error was so extended that even the poet and scholar Alastair Reid translated one of the Spanish versions into English under the belief that it was a work from Borges.

{"id": "31586093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31586093", "title": "Multi-channel transition", "text": "Multi-channel transition\n\nAccording to Amanda D. Lotz, the multi-channel transition began in the early 1980s and lasted about 20 years. Many changes happened during this transition such as the invention of the remote control, the video cassette player, and analog cable systems expanded viewer's choice and control. This era gave viewers more choice and control over what and when they wanted to view a program. Viewers were able to defy the networks' schedules, because they could record the program and watch it whenever they wanted, using the VCR and later the DVR. Producers adjusted to the government regulations and networks were forced to give up some of the control they had over program creation. Subscription channels emerged with no advertisements and the method for measuring audiences grew with the Nielsen People Meter.\n\nNew broadcast networks emerged such as Fox in 1986, The WB in 1995 and the UPN in 1995 and all added great competition to the original networks, NBC, ABC, and CBS. The percentage of people who watched network television dropped from 90% to 64% in the 1980s. During the 1990s, in spite of the new broadcast competitors, viewers carried on to switch from prime time viewing to cable, even though the rate wasn't as high as before. Still, broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, The WB, and UPN) gathered an average of only 58 percent of those watching television at the end of the 1999-2000 season, and only 46 percent in the final of the 2004-2005 season.\n\nThe remote control became standard on most television sets in the 1980s and that helped the viewers break away from the network era. The VCR further helped viewers to break away from the network era by enabling them to record a program and view it when they wanted to. The VCR also allowed people to build personal libraries. All of these new technologies allowed the viewer greater choice and control over specific media.\n\nThe emergence of so many new networks and channels changed the type of programming produced in order to gain more ratings points. Producers and advertisers were now able to target specific people and appeal to a narrower group. The ability for cable channels to succeed with smaller audiences made broadcasters' mission more difficult, because viewers now had the option to choose which program would satisfy their needs. Even though cable was readily available, that didn't mean that the viewer would receive every channel they wanted. Cable was then broken down into separate tiers and cable companies offered different packages for different geographic areas. Cable allowed viewers to have special interest in certain programs. The viewers found what channels or shows they liked best once cable was introduced.\n\nDuring the network era there were only three networks NBC, ABC, and CBS. The elimination of the fin-syn rules allowed networks greater involvement in production. With so few networks to choose from they (first three networks) held the upper hand in negotiations with studios. With the multi-channel transition production companies now had the upper hand with more networks to buy their shows. Where once the networks had control the production companies now held control.\n\nDuring the multi-channel transition, distribution windows expanded to include cable networks, direct sale on VCR tapes, and then DVD and VOD (Video On Demand). More recently they have also come to encompass Internet websites, where episodes can be downloaded or streamed. There has been such a high growing variety of ways for networks to reach viewers, which has also decreased some of the risk of unconventional programs, because new distribution routes provide opportunities to make money on shows that fail to achieve high ratings during network runs. Internet distribution also provides a venue for additional and supplemental programming.\n\nBefore the multi-channel transition, only signals broadcast over the air could be received on television in the home. Later, a range of possibilities developed. Cable television and satellite television became common mechanisms of delivery, and companies such as AT&T and Verizon also joined the competition of distribution during the mid-2000s. In 2006, broadband internet distribution of video became overwhelmingly popular, which diminished the domination of cable and satellite as the only source for most channels to be able to reach the home.\n"}

{"id": "4789420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4789420", "title": "Pintel and Ragetti", "text": "Pintel and Ragetti\n\nPintel and Ragetti are recurring characters in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film series, primarily providing comic relief throughout each film. Pintel and Ragetti are portrayed by Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook, respectively.\n\nTheir first appearance occurred in \"\", when they served under Hector Barbossa upon the \"Black Pearl\". Pintel and Ragetti, along with Barbossa and the crew of the \"Black Pearl\", share in the Aztec curse and are immortal for the majority of the film.\n\nIn the second film, \"\", Pintel and Ragetti serve under Captain Jack Sparrow, again providing comic relief and additionally the occasional important insight into other characters. They join the ever-lengthening list of people who want the Dead Man's Chest, hoping to \"remove temptation\" from the other characters' path and make a profit themselves.\n\nIn \"\", Ragetti and Pintel play a more significant part in the plot while still supplying comic relief. In this installment, they serve under Hector Barbossa in the journey to rescue Jack, and then serve in the joint effort by Barbossa and Sparrow to defeat the East India Trading Company. Barbossa uses Ragetti's wooden eye as his \"Piece of Eight\" (one of a group of nine sacrificial Pieces of Eight used to free Calypso), so Pintel covers his empty eye socket with an eye patch.\n\nIn the video game \"\" Pintel and Ragetti are both voiced by Greg Ellis.\n\nLittle is known about the background of either Pintel or Ragetti. According to \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Visual Guide\", prior to serving as cannoneers aboard the \"Black Pearl\", Ragetti and Pintel spent a year as naval sailors, press-ganged into service for the Royal Navy before deserting to escape the bad food and abusive treatment. As part of a backstory worked out by both Arenberg and Crook, their characters' full names are Terry Ragetti and Abner Pintel, and that Ragetti was the son of Pintel's sister, and they shared half a brain. Arenberg also claims Ragetti is the son of a prostitute.\n\nThe two pirates served aboard the \"Black Pearl\" under Captain Sparrow until first mate Hector Barbossa turned them against him. The crew maroons Jack on an island and leave him to die (though he eventually escapes). Later Captain Barbossa becomes \"Captain\" much to Bootstrap Bill's fury. Bootstrap was the only one that vouched for Jack during the mutiny and sent a coin to his son Will in order to keep the crew cursed for betraying Jack. Barbossa in response tied a cannon to Bootstrap and threw him overboard the \"Pearl\" only to discover that Bootstrap is needed to lift their curse. They are first seen in \"The Curse of The Black Pearl\" when they invade the governor's house and take Elizabeth Swann prisoner. In the sea battle between the \"Black Pearl\" and the \"H.M.S. Interceptor\", they fire the chainshot that smashes the \"H.M.S. Interceptor\"s foremast, making pursuit impossible. They also facilitated the cursed pirates boarding Commodore Norrington's ship, the \"Dauntless\", by dressing in women's clothing to attract the attention of the men on the ship. Their characters provide comic relief during the movie's more intense scenes and provide storyline information. When the curse is broken and the pirates defeated, they are captured and jailed. They serve as secondary antagonists of the movie.\n\nA running gag throughout the first movie involves characters surrendering themselves to Ragetti and Pintel while invoking the right of \"parley\". At first they are pleased with invoking parley but according to the story's premise parley guarantees a prisoner will be escorted unharmed to the captain in order to conduct negotiations. Then they become irritated when all their captures invoke parley especially when Jack Sparrow invokes parley after he was discovered alive. At one point, Pintel snarls at his captives, \"If any of you so much as thinks of the word 'parley', I'll have your guts for garters!\". After they are captured, Pintel attempts unsuccessfully to invoke parley himself.\n\nThere are also frequent gags involving Ragetti's wooden false eye, which causes discomfort and is often knocked out of its socket and has him frantically searching for it; one of Ragetti's professed desires is to have a real \"glass\" eye. It is not known how he lost his real one, though in \"At Worlds End\", it is revealed that the wooden eye is one of the nine \"pieces of eight\" the Brethren Court used to imprison Calypso in her human form. Barbossa, a pirate lord, gave it to Ragetti for safekeeping. At the end of \"At Worlds End\", Ragetti can be seen carving a new eye. There are also jokes about the two characters' feelings of closeness. Whenever they do, they become embarrassed or angry, and the moment quickly passes; therefore director Gore Verbinski jokingly described the two as more of a \"married couple\".\n\nIn the sequel, the pair have escaped jail and are rowing a boat to Pelegosto island, along with the dog who holds the keys to the jail cells, whom they have named \"Poochie\". Ragetti has become somewhat religious, telling Pintel, \"Since we're not immortal no more, we gotta take care of our immortal souls\" when attempting to read the Bible (unsuccessfully, holding the book upside down). When they find the \"Black Pearl\" run aground on the island, Pintel convinces Ragetti that taking the ship would be salvage, and that salvaging would be saving it. Although they attempted to steal the \"Black Pearl\", Jack magnanimously, if unintentionally, allows them to rejoin his crew. Although they become more or less loyal members of his crew, the writers state in the DVD commentary that Jack considers them, as well as James Norrington, as the most expendable crew members.\n\nLater, when Jack is searching for Davy Jones's heart and a fight breaks out between himself, Norrington, and Will Turner, Pintel and Ragetti once again have an opportunity to steal something valuable; to convince his partner, Pintel tells Ragetti they will be \"removing temptation from their paths\" by stealing the Dead Man's Chest. They take it, but do not get far before Elizabeth catches up to them. Pintel greets Elizabeth much as he greeted her when they first met by saying, in an eerie tone, \"'ello, poppet\". Before they can do anything to her, however, Davy Jones's crew attacks and they drop the chest. When the \"Flying Dutchman\"s crew overtakes them, they fight alongside Elizabeth, with whom they share the two swords that Ragetti and Pintel had.\n\nDespite their fighting success, they quickly hand their swords to Elizabeth and take off with the chest again, which they promptly lose. When cornered by Jones's men, they still fight with various objects used as improvised weapons.\n\nThe two pirates are not without loyalty or humanity. When the Kraken attacks the \"Black Pearl\", Ragetti saves Elizabeth from its deadly tentacle. Both Ragetti and Pintel shed genuine tears of respect and grief over Jack's demise and join the pledge to resurrect their fallen captain; this is ironic, considering they supported and participated in Barbossa's mutiny against Jack and marooned him on the island (the change seems to have come from the fact that he came back for and \"sacrificed\" himself for his crew, including them).\n\nThe comic duo (especially Ragetti) can unexpectedly engage in erudite and intelligent discussions. In these discussions, Ragetti often proves that he is more educated than he appears, even though he is illiterate, though Ragetti argues the point. When Tia Dalma says that something vexed Davy Jones so much that he abandoned land for an eternal life at sea, Ragetti asks whether this was \"the dichotomy of good and evil\", causing Pintel and Gibbs to give him astonished looks. The two also engage in a debate over the proper pronunciation of \"Kraken\", with Pintel saying he believes the correct pronunciation is \"kray-ken\" while most say \"krack-en\". Ragetti explains that the derivation of the word is from original Scandinavian, and thus should be pronounced \"krah-ken\". Pintel points out they are not \"Original Scandinavians\", to which Ragetti retorts, \"It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants!\". Ragetti also displays a knack for knowing things he should not, such as the reasons for which Jack, Will, and Norrington each want the heart of Davy Jones (Jack to control Jones and protect himself, Will to free his father from the less-than-friendly bond between the Flying Dutchman and her crew, and Norrington to restore his honor). This tendency had earlier appeared in \"The Curse of the Black Pearl\", wherein Ragetti compares a ruse used by himself and Pintel to the ruse of the Trojan Horse while they were distracting the Royal Navy by pretending to be women: \"It's just like what the Greeks done at Troy... 'cept they was in a horse, not dresses. Wooden horse\".\n\nBefore the movie was released, the actors announced that the characters of Ragetti and Pintel would play roles of some importance to the plot. In an interview with Empire magazine (Australia) Mackenzie Crook says \"You sort of discover that Lee (Arenberg) and I are there for more than just comic relief in the third movie. It turns out that we do have a purpose in the grand scheme of things\". As seen in the trailer and in the movie itself, the two throw swords up through floorboards of Sao Feng's bathhouse to Elizabeth and Barbossa, allowing them to defend themselves when both Feng and the East India Trading Company attack.\n\nIn Davy Jones' Locker, when Jack is \"choosing\" his crew members, he refuses Ragetti, saying, \"Don't need you, you scare me\", though he comes anyway. When Barbossa asks 'Where you would be going Jack?' with the charts in his hands, clearly alluding to the fact that he, and not Jack ought to be the captain, Pintel and Ragetti are seen standing behind Barbossa with a sadistic smile in their faces, indicating that once they have learnt that contrary to what they had been thinking up to then, Jack hadn't really ′sacrificed′ himself to Kraken to save their lives, but was rather pushed into it courtesy Elizabeth, they are no longer loyal to Jack. When Jack asks the crew if anyone saved him because they missed him and not to serve their own ends, the two are among the few (including Jack the Monkey) to raise their hands. Later, when Barbossa and Sparrow arguing over who is \"Black Pearl's\" captain, Pintel yells at them to stop arguing, leaving the two briefly stunned into silence. Realizing his precarious position, he apologizes, saying he is under the impression that the position of captain is open to election. Ragetti consoles his old friend by saying \"I would have voted for you\".\n\nRagetti's eye is used in a ritual to free Calypso; when Barbossa fails to release her, Ragetti steps in, correctly delivering the incantation \"as if to a lover\", triggering the spell in a well-deserved 'shining moment' for his character.\n\nAt the film's end, the two serve aboard the \"Black Pearl\", which Barbossa has again commandeered from Jack. Pintel says about the matter: \"Some of the men don't feel entirely \"settled\" about leaving Captain Jack behind again\". When Barbossa asked if that was so, Pintel says \"It would make us feel a whole lot better, regarding our fortunes, if we could see that \"item\" you told us about.\", the item meaning the Fountain of Youth (This mirrors Barbossa asking for the coordinates of the Chest of Cortes while planning a mutiny.) When Barbossa shows them the charts, a big hole appears where the map's crucial component was removed by Sparrow. Ragetti is also seen making a new wooden eye for himself.\n\nIn the third installment, Ragetti again shows that he is more educated than he appears when he says \"Actually, it's a cephalopod\" after Pintel calls the dead Kraken a \"stupid fish\".\n\nPintel and Ragetti are not seen or mentioned in \"\", as the \"Black Pearl\" is attacked and taken by Blackbeard. Barbossa was able to survive the attack. Their further fate is currently unknown. During the production of the fourth film, they were originally supposed to make an appearance, but director Rob Marshall opted out of the idea as he feared their roles would be cut.\n\nAlso are not seen or mentioned in \"\". However, since Murtogg, Mullroy, and Marty returned to the series, despite having previously been implied to be either trapped in Blackbeard's bottle or slain in battle, it is possible that Pintel and Ragetti could return in a future installment.\n\nBoth Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook commented on the possibility of returning as Pintel and Ragetti. Arenberg confirmed in several interviews that, despite wanting to return to the fourth film, he hoped to reprise his role as Pintel. In an interview on November 7, 2014, Crook confirmed that he had received a call of availability from Disney for the film, although stated that he was uncertain about whether he wanted to reprise his role. Crook declined to reprise his role ultimately, in order to focus on his television series \"Detectorists\". He said he felt \"pangs of nostalgia,\" when the cast and crew filmed the film without him. Furthermore, shortly before filming started, Arenberg announced on Twitter that he would not reprise his role as well, despite having been interested in doing so.\n\nPintel and Ragetti appear and act nearly always together; therefore their roles in the film series have been compared with those of Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd in \"Diamonds Are Forever\".\nSeveral scenes that feature them became recurring jokes/motifs in the series with the release of the sequel. For example:\n\nThey are the counterparts to the two Royal Marines Murtogg and Mullroy. The two comic relief pairs are united at the end of the movie, where Murtogg and Mullroy, disguised as pirates, celebrate the victory of the pirates after running away from their posts after they failed to keep Davy Jones' heart safe.\n\nBy the second movie, Ragetti becomes very religious. He is seen trying to read a Bible upside down, even when Pintel reveals that Ragetti cannot read (to which Ragetti retorts, \"It's the Bible, you get credit for tryin'.\"). His reason for doing so is the idea that, having lost his immortality, he is worried about the afterlife of his soul. Viewers can also see his new look on life in the scene in Tia Dalma's Swamp, wherein he suggests that the thing that vexes all men is \"the dichotomy of good and evil\". We can again see his religious/philosophical/intellectual side in the third movie, when the crew is frost-covered and he calmly contemplates aloud, \"There must be a good reason for our suffering\". This may have also been a sarcastic complaint/question to Barbossa. Also in this film, when Pintel sees the kraken's body at the beach, he calls it a \"Stupid fish!\", but Ragetti reminds him that the Kraken is a cephalopod, thus making another joke about the contrast of his intellect over his ragged appearance.\n\nLike most pirates, Pintel and Ragetti wear old, threadbare clothes. According to \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Visual Guide\", Ragetti's green jacket was stolen from a French nobleman, Pintel's trousers are washed with urine in an attempt to remove bloodstains, and Ragetti's trousers are covered with tar to make them waterproof – both of which were real methods used in the days of piracy. It also was mentioned in \"The Visual Guide\" that Pintel spends hours in front of a mirror in order to practice his famous gloomy face expression. Their coats are similar to that of Jack Sparrow.\n\nPintel and Ragetti are skilled fighters; both before and after their immortality is lost, they are shown standing up to many times their number. Normally, they both fight with cutlasses, but in a scene in \"Dead Man's Chest\", when Elizabeth had taken their swords from them, they continue fighting with incredible efficiency using only the chest, an oar, and a net. They also use flintlock pistols, while it should be noticed that Pintel uses a double-barrelled one, which you can see clearly as he points it at Jack Sparrow in the \"Curse of the Black Pearl\". In \"At World's End\", Ragetti uses the butt of a pistol as a club. They are skilled gunners during sea battles; in the battle between the \"Black Pearl\" and the \"H.M.S. Interceptor\", they serve at the cannons. Similar to Barbossa, they seem not to have any moral issues about murdering innocent people, like Elizabeth's Butler or the Royal Marine and switch to the right side quickly, but against the other cursed crew of the Black Pearl (like the brutal Bo'sun or the nasty Koehler), they seem to have good hearts, more or less.\n\nBoth Pintel and Ragetti were made into Action Figures in NECA's Series 2 of the \"\" series and also in Zizzle's 1:18 scale \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Secrets of the Deep\" toy line. NECA would make them into Action Figures once again in Series 1 of the Series, and Zizzle included them as part of their own \"\" series .\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "142412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142412", "title": "Quiz Show (film)", "text": "Quiz Show (film)\n\nQuiz Show is a 1994 American historical film produced and directed by Robert Redford, and written by Paul Attanasio, based on Richard N. Goodwin's memoir \"Remembering America: A Voice From the Sixties.\" It stars John Turturro, Rob Morrow and Ralph Fiennes, with Paul Scofield, David Paymer, Hank Azaria and Christopher McDonald appearing in supporting roles.\n\nThe film chronicles the \"Twenty-One\" quiz show scandals of the 1950s, the rise and fall of popular contestant Charles Van Doren after the fixed loss of Herb Stempel and Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin's subsequent probe. Goodwin co-produced the film. The film received generally positive reviews and was nominated for several awards, including a Best Picture Oscar nomination and several Golden Globe Awards. It had a disappointing box office return.\n\nIn 1958, the questions and answers to be used for the latest broadcast of NBC's popular quiz show \"Twenty-One\" are transported from a secure bank vault to the studio. The evening's main attraction is Queens resident Herb Stempel (John Turturro), the reigning champion, who correctly answers question after question. However, both the network and the program's corporate sponsor, the supplementary tonic Geritol, find that Stempel's approval ratings are beginning to level out, meaning the show would benefit from new talent.\n\nProducers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) are surprised when Columbia University instructor Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), son of a prominent literary family, visits their office to audition. Realizing that they have found an ideal challenger for Stempel, they offer to ask the same questions during the show which Van Doren correctly answered during his audition. He refuses, but when he comes within reach of a game-winning 21 points on the show, he is asked one of the questions from his audition. After a moment of moral indecision, he gives the correct answer. Stempel, having been promised a future on television if he takes a dive, deliberately misses his chance at reaching 21 by incorrectly answering one of the show's easiest questions.\n\nIn the weeks that follow, Van Doren's winning streak makes him a national celebrity, but he buckles under the pressure and allows Enright and Freedman to start giving him the answers. Meanwhile, Stempel, having lost his prize money to an unscrupulous bookie, begins threatening legal action against NBC after weeks go by without his return to television. He visits New York County District Attorney Frank Hogan, who convenes a grand jury to look into his allegations.\n\nRichard Goodwin (Rob Morrow), a young Congressional lawyer, learns that the grand jury findings have been sealed and travels to New York City to investigate rumors of rigged quiz shows. Visiting a number of contestants, including Stempel and Van Doren, he begins to suspect that \"Twenty-One\" is a fixed operation. However, Stempel's volatile personality damages his credibility, and nobody else seems willing to confirm that the show is fixed. Fearing Goodwin will give up the investigation, Stempel confesses that he was fed the correct answers during his run on the show, and insists that Van Doren must have been involved as well. Another former contestant gives Goodwin quiz show answers he mailed to himself by registered post two days before the show, presumably as blackmail against Enright and Freedman.\n\nVan Doren deliberately loses. He is rewarded by NBC with a lucrative contract to appear as a special correspondent on the morning \"Today\" show. The House Committee for Legislative Oversight convenes a hearing, at which Goodwin presents his evidence of the quiz show's corruption. \n\nDuring the hearing, Stempel's testimony fails to convince the committee. Both NBC network head Robert Kintner (Allan Rich) and Geritol executive Martin Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese) deny any knowledge of \"Twenty-One\" being rigged. After being subpoenaed by Goodwin, Van Doren testifies before the committee and admits his role in the deception. After the hearing adjourns, he learns from reporters that he has been fired from \"Today\" and that Columbia's trustees are going to ask for his resignation.\n\nGoodwin believes he is on the verge of a victory against Geritol and NBC, but realizes that Enright and Freedman will not jeopardize their own futures in television by turning against their bosses. He silently watches the producers' testimony, vindicating the sponsors and the network from any wrongdoing, and taking full responsibility for rigging the show.\n\nJournalist Ken Auletta, in a 1994 article in \"The New Yorker\", noted that Redford conceded at a screening of the film that summer that \"dramatic license\" was taken in making \"Quiz Show\". Redford made no apologies for the liberties, which included telescoping three years of scandal into one. Redford stated that he had tried \"to elevate something so that people can see it ... otherwise, you might as well have a documentary.\" Redford noted there had already been a documentary on the scandal, referring to the Julian Krainin-produced work for a 1992 installment of the PBS series \"The American Experience\".\n\nIn a July 2008 edition of \"The New Yorker\", Van Doren writes about the events depicted in the film, agreeing with many of the details but also saying that he had a regular girlfriend (who eventually became his wife) at the time he was on \"Twenty-One\", who is not present in the film depiction. Van Doren also notes that he continued teaching, contrary to the film's epilogue which states he never returned to doing so.\n\nThe film opened in limited release on September 14, 1994. After its initial run, the film grossed a domestic total of $24,822,619 and was a box office bomb.\n\nThe film currently holds a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3 1/2 stars out of four, calling the screenplay \"smart, subtle and ruthless.\" Web critic James Berardinelli praised the \"superb performances by Fiennes\", and said \"John Turturro is exceptional as the uncharismatic Herbie Stempel.\" Writing for \"Entertainment Weekly,\" Owen Gleiberman highlighted the supporting performance of Paul Scofield as Mark Van Doren, stating that \"it’s in the relationship between the two Van Dorens that \"Quiz Show\" finds its soul.\"\n\nPaul Scofield was also nominated for the Dallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actor, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nJohn Turturro was also nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role, and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\n"}

{"id": "3516935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3516935", "title": "Suikoden V", "text": "Suikoden V\n\nLoosely based on a classical Chinese novel, \"Shui Hu Zhuan\" by Shi Nai'an, \"Suikoden V\" centers on the political struggles of the Queendom of Falena, and takes place 6 in-universe years before the events of the first \"Suikoden\". The player controls the Prince of Falena and travels the world, acquiring allies and dealing with the problems of the nation. The game features a vast array of characters, with over sixty characters usable in combat and many more able to help or hinder the Prince in a variety of ways.\n\n\"Suikoden V\" is a role-playing video game and thus features many of the usual traits. The player controls the Prince and travels with him around the world map, advancing the plot by completing tasks and talking with other characters. The Prince can also recruit new characters to his cause, which often involves a short sidequest. In towns, the player can gather information, sharpen character's weaponry, learn new skills and buy equipment; wilderness areas generally feature random encounters with monsters.\n\nThe battle system to \"Suikoden V\" features six person parties in combat rather than the four person parties of \"Suikoden IV\", reversing a much-decried change. Each character is individually controllable, as well (as opposed to \"Suikoden III\"). A variety of statistics in \"Suikoden V\" determine in-game combat ability. Like in \"Suikoden III\", there exists a skill system in \"Suikoden V\"; for instance, the \"Stamina\" skill increases a character's hit points. Different characters have affinities for different skills. Only two skills can be equipped to each character, though they can be switched at any time between battles. If all six characters lose all their hit points and are thus incapacitated, it is game over and the player must restart. Exceptions exist for certain plot battles in which winning is optional; the player can lose and the plot continues on, albeit in a slightly different fashion.\n\nThe characters can be set up in a variety of fighting formations across a roughly 6x4 grid. Each formation allows the party to gain increased statistics, such as increased defense or increased attacks, occasionally offset by decreased stats in other categories, as well as a special attack based on the formation. New formations are acquired over the course of the game. Like in previous games, some characters have special cooperative attacks that can potentially do more damage. These attacks often do more damage than normal and cannot miss, but they also cannot receive critical damage bonuses and cannot hit targets multiple times. An auto-battle function is enable as well for quickly breezing through easy battles.\n\nCharacters that don't participate directly in combat usually offer other services to the Prince, such as running a shop, giving clues for potential recruits, or aiding in the strategic war battles. Additionally, up to four characters may be kept in reserve of the current party; some non-combat characters, when in the reserve, offer minor benefits such as healing after battle or a greater chance of finding a special item after battle.\n\nRunes, the source of all magic in the world of \"Suikoden\", are handled similarly to other \"Suikoden\" games. Characters have a certain number of spell usages per \"spell level;\" for instance, a character with four level 1 spell slots and a Water Rune could cast \"Kindness Drops\" (the level 1 Water Rune spell) four times. Other runes offer different benefits, and some may be used as often as desired.\n\nThe strategic war battles from earlier \"Suikoden\"s return for major army clashes, in real-time with more freedom of movement than the hex and square based earlier installments. Instead, the battlefield is now continuous. Both land and naval battles exist in \"Suikoden V\"; some battles even combine both elements. The system is analogous to Rock, Paper, Scissors, where cavalry beats infantry, infantry beats archers, and archers beat cavalry; at sea, ram ships are strong against archery ships, infantry ships defeat rams, and archery ships beat infantry ships. There are also additional benefits to having certain characters in certain units, such as magical attacks using runes or leadership bonuses. A few special units exist as well in beaver units and dragon cavalry units, which can travel on both sea and land.\n\n\"Suikoden V\" also contains a number of minigames, including, but not limited to, fishing, accessible through the character Subala, and Blind Man's Bluff, a card game that Linfa plays.\n\n\"Suikoden V\" takes place in the Queendom of Falena, portraying the events of that region of the \"Suikoden\" world eight years before the events in \"Suikoden\" and 142 years after the events in \"Suikoden IV\" (~IS 449). The Queendom of Falena is a relatively rich land sustained by the Feitas River, which connects its disparate parts and enables trade and communication. It is ruled by Queen Arshtat and her husband Ferid, who have been a balancing and steady force since the demise of her somewhat rash mother. However, the tensions of the past have not been entirely settled. Arshtat's mother and aunt had been engaged in a covert struggle for power over the succession. Falena's government also has powerful nobles who maintain their own separate forces, loyal to them. Arshtat's hand in marriage was seen as key to gaining power in the future by the nobles; a civil war was narrowly averted when Ferid, a neutral outsider, won the Sacred Games and thus the right to marry Arshtat.\n\nArshtat and Ferid begat two heirs, the Prince (named by the player, called Freyjdour in the manga) and Lymsleia. At the beginning of \"Suikoden V\", the time has come for Lymsleia's Sacred Games, a gladiatorial tournament in which the winner may ask for the future Queen's hand in marriage. (As a Queendom rather than a Kingdom, the first-born female is in line for the throne.) Aside from the many freelancers, suitors, and independent nobles who desire this prize, the two most powerful noble houses both bear a special interest in it; like with Arshtat's Sacred Games, Lymsleia's hand could prove a crucial advantage. The Godwins believe that Falena needs to be more centralized, powerful and perhaps expansionistic. The Barows seek more to rebuild and trade with foreign nations. The Barows faction has of late been somewhat on the decline, though they are still powerful; a recent war with the neighboring New Armes Kingdom was fought on Barows-allied lands, while the Godwins remained safe and untouched in the west of Falena, perhaps explaining the Barows wish to not further antagonize Armes. The royal family and others worry that if a Godwin or Barows were to win, it might well trigger another struggle.\n\nA key part of the \"Suikoden\" setting is the existence of Runes, the source of all magic. Any person can have a rune inscribed on them, although some people are more talented in their use, and others can inscribe more than one rune (with three as the general maximum). In turn, all power from individual carved runes ultimately descends from the powerful 27 True Runes, which created the world in \"Suikoden\"s mythology. Falena's national treasure is the Sun Rune, a True Rune which can both bring prosperity and growth as well as destruction and calamity. Falena also controls the \"child\" runes of the Sun Rune, the Dawn Rune and Twilight Rune.\n\nHowever, Falena's grip on the runes has gone somewhat awry. Two years prior to the start of \"Suikoden V\", residents of Lordlake rioted and charged the East Palace, near the capital of Sol-Falena. In the confusion, the Dawn Rune, which was housed there, was stolen. Lordlake had previously been considered the most loyal of all the towns to the royal government and granted special privileges. With this seeming act of high treason by Lordlake, Arshtat took the Sun Rune upon herself, normally stored in Sol-Falena's palace on a pedestal, and used the Rune's power to scorch Lordlake's vegetation, wildlife and river, killing its leader Lord Rovere in the process. Since bearing the Sun Rune, the normally compassionate Arshtat has grown more and more erratic in behavior, prone to mood swings and wild fits of vengeance.\n\nAs with previous \"Suikoden\" titles, there are \"108 Stars of Destiny\" to recruit in the game. While some characters join as per the story's requirements, others require that the Prince recruit them either at a specific time, or by fulfilling particular conditions. As such, certain characters can be missed entirely.\n\nSome of the characters from \"Suikoden V\" appeared in earlier \"Suikoden\" games; as \"Suikoden V\" takes place before \"I\"–\"III\", their experiences in Falena are a prequel of sorts for them. Notably, Georg Prime and Lorelai both play important roles in \"Suikoden V\" and appear in other games, while Viki, Jeane and Leknaat continue their run of all \"Suikoden\" games to date.\n\nTwo years after Lordlake was razed by her Sun Rune, Queen Arshtat dispatches her son the Prince, her sister Sialeeds, and their royal bodyguards Lyon and Georg Prime to inspect the state of the ruined town. The player as the Prince sees the grim state of the dried-up town and report on it, but Arshtat scorns this; she declares that Lordlake's citizens deserve their desolation for stealing the Dawn Rune. Arshtat's husband Ferid pulls her back to her senses, and she dismisses the inspection party with a whisper.\n\nThe next issue of contention is the Sacred Games for Princess Lymsleia's hand in marriage, being held somewhat early for the ten-year-old Lymsleia. The two main contestants, both representing themselves with a champion, hail from rival noble houses: the foppish Euram Barows, and Sialeeds' former fiancé, the charismatic Gizel Godwin. The royal family, however, favors the mysterious outsider Belcoot, as a neutral option less likely to cause strife; the Prince attempts to aid Belcoot quietly with Ferid's approval. However, Gizel successfully rigs the Games to his advantage, and his champion Childerich defeats a drugged Belcoot while the Barow's champion is disqualified.\n\nHowever, Lord Marscal Godwin, Gizel's father, is less than impressed with Gizel's activities, thinking that he has made an enemy of the Prince and the royal family as a whole with his plotting. Additionally, the royal family took Zegai, the Barows champion, into their own personal custody, who could perhaps help reveal the Godwins cheating and offer an excuse to annul the engagement. Thus, the Godwins launch a preemptive attack at the engagement ceremony in Sol-Falena, Falena's capital. Arshtat and Ferid had anticipated and prepared for the attack, but not the involvement of the elite Nether Gate assassins, who overwhelm the palace's defenses. The struggle culminates in Arshtat and Ferid's deaths, while Lymsleia finds herself a captive. The Prince (whose irrelevance to the line of succession made him the lowest-priority target), Lyon, Georg and Sialeeds are forced to flee.\n\nThe Prince searches first for a sanctuary, then for a way to fight back. He finds both (temporarily) as a guest of the influential noble Salum Barows, Lord Godwin's long-time rival. Salum (with his son Euram alongside) clearly plans to be the senior partner in his alliance with the Prince, but the Prince must take what allies he can find. Reluctantly, Sialeeds suggests bringing in help in the form of the legendary tactician Lucretia Merces, whom the Prince frees from prison. With her intelligence and vast network of contacts, Lucretia finds out that the Barows were behind the theft of the Dawn Rune – an act of high treason. With this revelation, the Prince is able to convince the Barows' allies to join him personally, including even Salum's daughter Luserina. The recovered Dawn Rune picks the Prince as its new bearer, even though the Prince can never inherit the throne.\n\nLucretia guides the Prince and his army in establishing a headquarters, forging alliances, restoring Lordlake, and winning a long streak of battles. The Godwins crown Lymsleia Queen and claim to fight in her name, but lose the public relations war due to the Prince's resistance, the claims of a coup, the restoration of Lordlake (thus fixing a mistake of Arshtat's rule), and the Godwins' army commanders foolish brutality. The civil war almost comes to a close when Lymsleia takes the field personally, officially due to the Godwin's failure to put down the \"rebellion\", but actually to be rescued by her brother. The Prince and his forces defeat her bodyguards and attempt to capture Lymsleia back; without Lymsleia, the Godwin's government would collapse. At this juncture, however, Sialeeds defects to Gizel's side, spiriting Lymsleia away and prolonging the conflict. Lyon is seriously wounded, preventing the party from pursuing Lymsleia. Meanwhile, Sialeeds takes up the Twilight Rune, the counterpart to the Dawn Rune held in Godwin territory.\n\nThe Godwins enjoy a brief reversal in fortunes with new army levies and an alliance with a faction of Falena's neighbor Armes. However, Falena's normally neutral Dragon Cavalry enters the war on the Prince's side due to Armes' involvement, and the Godwins are driven back once more. Sialeeds ensures that the Prince's forces must capture Stormfist, the seat of Godwin power, and thoroughly erase any possible strongholds of Godwin sympathy. Despite seemingly being affiliated with the Godwins, however, Sialeeds incinerates a Godwin ambush of the Prince's force. Sialeeds later murders Salum Barows in Gizel's name, leaving the whimpering Euram alive with the venomous taunt that the Barows faction will surely fall to ruin with an idiot like him in charge.\n\nOnly the capital city of Sol-Falena remains under Godwin control. The battle for it claims the lives of both Sialeeds and Gizel. As she expires, Sialeeds hints at her motives (which her maids confirm, if the player speaks with them later): she knew that, if the Prince had rescued Lymsleia when he first had the chance, things only would have returned to the way they were before, with the same corrupt nobility holding power struggles. The only way, in her mind, to secure the royal family's hold on the Queendom was to prolong the war such that the nobility would be completely and utterly ruined. By doing it in the Godwins' name, the Prince and Lymsleia could be rid of them without getting their hands dirty. As Gizel dies, felled by the Prince in a duel, he declares that Sialeeds was the only real winner. Lord Marscal, the only remaining Godwin, retreats with the Sun Rune to a nearby mountain range, where he meets the Prince in a showdown to prove that the royals can rule without the power of the Sun Rune. He draws the Rune's power into himself for the final battle with the Rune incarnation.\n\nIn the ending, Lymsleia re-assumes the throne and dissolves the Senate, though a new representative parliament is created to replace it and advise the Queen. Depending on the player's choices and performance, several endings are possible. If very few optional stars of destiny were recruited, Lyon dies of the wounds she received earlier and the Prince wanders off alone in despair. If most but not all of the stars were recruited, the Prince travels the world with Georg. If all 108 Stars were recruited, Lyon survives. If the Prince chose to be nice when interacting with Lymsleia, he has the further option of staying in Falena and becoming the new Commander of the Queen's Knights, with Lyon by his side.\n\n\"Suikoden V\" was directed by Takahiro Sakiyama, a newcomer to the \"Suikoden\" franchise, and written by Kazuyoshi Tsugawa, who served as the writer for \"The Sword of Etheria\" and worked on the battle system design for \"Skies of Arcadia\". The game started out as a \"gaiden\" to the series, with development beginning even before that of \"Suikoden IV\". However, as the content that the team came up with grew, it eventually evolved into a main installment.\n\nThe music to \"Suikoden V\" was composed by Norikazu Miura and Konami veteran Miki Higashino. Miura, however, did all of the arrangement. The opening movie piece, \"Wind of Phantom,\" was composed, conducted, and produced by Yuji Toriyama; he arranged for it to be played by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The soundtrack includes a large number of remixes and references to Higashino's work in \"Suikoden\" and \"Suikoden II\", ending with \"Into a World of Illusions.\"\n\nThe complete \"Genso Suikoden V OST\", featuring all the music from the game in original form, was released on March 24, 2006. A shorter \"Limited Edition\" demo disc with 10 tracks had been released earlier.\n\n\"Suikoden V\" had disappointing sales compared to earlier PlayStation 2 \"Suikodens\". In 2006 in Japan, the game sold 194,780 copies, down from \"Suikoden IV\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 303,069. Nevertheless, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one seven for a total of 32 out of 40.\n\nElsewhere, the game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The plot received praise for the depth of its political maneuverings, even if the game starts off somewhat slowly: GameSpy said, \"\"Suikoden V\" has a robust, well-done plot that doesn't telegraph every twist or conform to embarrassing clichés.\" Most reviewers also found the cast of characters engaging, as well; GameSpot said that \"\"Suikoden\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s always been great at making the stars evince unique personalities with just a few exchanges of conversation, and there's lots of interesting people to meet and lure to your forces.\" \"Suikoden V\" also reversed some of the unpopular changes of \"Suikoden IV\" (such as 4-person parties), and offered some tie-ins to \"Suikoden\" and \"Suikoden II\" for fans of the original PlayStation games.\n\nThe graphics and loading times were generally criticized, however. IGN wrote, \"there's a ton of loading everywhere you turn. Moving from one area to another means 2-5 second loads; initiating a battle means 7-10 second loads; winning a skirmish brings 4-6 second loads afterwards.\" Game Revolution said of the graphics that \"Army battles and in-engine cut scenes look blocky and raw, but the CGI cut scenes are beautiful and detailed. Towns look great, but dungeons are horrid, bland, maze-like nightmares.\"\n\n\"Suikoden V\" won IGN's 2006 award for Best Story on the PlayStation 2. It also won the Danish gaming magazine \"Gamereactor\"s award for Best Story overall, and was named the 9th best game of the year by them.\n\n"}
{"id": "1420325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1420325", "title": "Takagari", "text": "Takagari\n\nIn Japan, records indicate that falconry began in the fourth century. According to a passage in the \"Nihon Shoki\" (720), falconry was introduced by the Baekje noble Sakenokimi in 359 during the reign of Emperor Nintoku. From the outset, the central Court and local lords both enjoyed hawking, with the former trying to monopolize falconry, sometimes with banning orders. Central power, however, as seen in the repetition of prohibiting orders, had no complete control over local falconry until the 17th century. In the 13th century, hawking became popular among the rising samurai class as well as among court nobles (\"kuge\"). At that time, the practice of hawking was a means of resolving struggles over land ownership among lords. Buddhist temples, who were also land owners, opposed falconry based on their ideology against killing. Falconer lords, on the other hand, devised a Buddhist rationale or resorted to Shinto justifications. Several falconry schools or styles (\"ryū\") were formed in the process.\n\nThe falconry methods employed in Japan had originally been Sino-Korean ones. Based on Chinese texts and practice, \"Shinshū Yōkyō\" was edited in 818 as a falconry textbook. From the 13th century on, nobles left falconry texts as evidence of their authority in falconry. The establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate in Kyoto allowed mutual influence between \"kuge\" and samurai on the development of the sport. Samurai falconers also began to write falconry texts in the 16th century.\n\nThe sport had always been a status symbol, as a very expensive pastime, involving not only the rarity and cost of the haggards, passages and eyasses, and the costs of housing, raising, and training them, but it also required access to a large amount of space, and a lot of time and effort, things presumably denied to all but the most fortunate of the common classes. With the opening of the Tokugawa period, the wars of the Sengoku period came to an end, and falconry became one of the primary outlets for the militaristic energies of the samurai class, along with archery, swordplay, and horse racing.\n\nTokugawa Ieyasu enjoyed falconry very much himself, and used it as a symbol of his authority, and of his plans for the country, transforming the violence of his conquest into a peacetime system of laws. He banned traditional falconry by \"kuge\", who had been holders of the art since the first introduction of falconry. He established restrictions on which ranks of creatures a samurai or \"daimyō\" (feudal lord) could hunt, from geese and ducks up to the more valuable swans. He also set up certain lands as \"takaba\" (鷹場), or falconry fields; practicing the sport on all other lands was forbidden. Many of these designated lands were farmers' lands; the peasant farmers were forced to provide labor for the hunt, which often took days or even weeks, and were forbidden from interfering with the prey creatures of their lands, despite the damage geese and other animals might do to crops.\n\nGoshawks, and other birds of prey, increasingly became symbols of status, and in the early Edo period, many paintings were commissioned by samurai. While the first images of hawks and eagles in Japan appeared in the 13th century, since the 14th and 15th centuries, paintings with hawks as the main subject appeared, under the influence of imported Chinese paintings. As the visibility and popularity of falconry grew, at the beginning of the Edo period, images of the hunt, of mews, of wild birds of prey, and even portraits of favored individual birds were increasingly commissioned. While common people were kept out of falconry, their interest in it gave rise to some ukiyo-e art by Hokusai, Hiroshige and Kawanabe Kyōsai.\n\nFalconry flourished throughout the Edo period, with only a short interruption imposed by Tokugawa Tsunayoshi. With the Meiji Revolution, the monopoly on falconry by samurai ended. Falconry was released to the public, but in the process of modernization, its prosperity faded. While the Imperial Household Ministry gathered ex-falconers and tried to keep their tradition, some methods were lost, and others were handed down to private enthusiasts. Hawk-eagle austringers in northeastern Japan have also emerged in the process, although their origin is somewhat uncertain.\n\nAfter World War II, the Imperial Household Agency suspended the practice of hawking, and the tradition of \"takagari\" is today kept by clubs formed by enthusiasts.\n\n"}

{"id": "44079493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44079493", "title": "The Lego Batman Movie", "text": "The Lego Batman Movie\n\nThe Lego Batman Movie is a 2017 computer-animated superhero comedy film produced by the Warner Animation Group. It was directed by Chris McKay, and written by Seth Grahame-Smith, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Jared Stern and John Whittington, and produced by Dan Lin, Roy Lee, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Based on the \"Lego Batman\" toy line, the film is an international co-production of the United States, Australia, and Denmark, and the first spin-off installment of \"The Lego Movie\" franchise. The story focuses on the DC Comics character Batman as he attempts to overcome his greatest fear to stop the Joker's latest plan, with Will Arnett reprising his role as Batman for the film, along with Zach Galifianakis, Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, and Ralph Fiennes.\n\n\"The Lego Batman Movie\" had its world premiere in Dublin, Ireland on January 29, 2017, and was released in the United States on February 10, 2017. Internationally, the film was released in 3D, RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, IMAX and IMAX 3D. The film received positive reviews, with critics praising its animation, voice acting, soundtrack, visual style, and humor, and grossed $312 million worldwide.\n\nIn the Lego Universe, Batman continues to protect Gotham City and fight crime. During his latest mission to stop Joker from destroying the city, he hurts his arch-rival's feelings by telling him he is not as important in his life as he thinks he is, leading Joker to seek the ultimate revenge on him. The following day, Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne, attends the city's winter gala, which is celebrating both the retirement of Commissioner Gordon and the ascension of his daughter Barbara as the city's new police commissioner, only to be infuriated by Barbara's plans to restructure the police to function without the need of Batman. Without warning, Joker crashes the party with the city's other villains, all of whom surrender, with the exception of Harley Quinn who disappears during the confusion.\n\nSuspecting his arch-rival is up to something, Batman plots to steal Superman's Phantom Zone Projector, a device that can banish anyone to the Phantom Zone which houses some of the most dangerous villains in the Lego multiverse. Just as he plans his heist of the device, Alfred intervenes and advises him to take charge of Dick Grayson, whom Bruce unwittingly adopted as his ward during the gala. Reluctantly agreeing to do so, Batman fosters Dick as Robin, whereupon the pair successfully recover the Projector from the Fortress of Solitude, and break into Arkham Asylum to send Joker to the Phantom Zone. Suspecting that the Joker wanted to be sent there, Barbara locks up Batman and Robin for their reckless actions.\n\nWhile the Projector is being seized as evidence, Harley steals it back as part of Joker's plan and frees him, allowing him to return to Gotham with all the villains he had recruited in the Phantom Zone, including King Kong, the Gremlins, the Wicked Witch of the West and her Flying Monkeys, a Tyrannosaurus Rex and a Velociraptor, Lord Voldemort, Sauron, the Jaws shark, the Daleks, Lord Vampyre, The Evil Mummy, Swamp Creature, Medusa, Agent Smith and his clones, Skeleton Warriors, General Zod, and the Kraken. Realizing that the city does need him, Barbara releases Batman and Robin and teams up with them and Alfred to stop the Joker. Although Batman finds himself able to trust and rely on his new team upon reaching Wayne Island, he chooses to send them away rather than losing them like his parents. Upon facing him alone, Joker believes that Batman is incapable of change and zaps him to the Phantom Zone before stealing the Batcave's stash of confiscated bombs. Arriving in the Phantom Zone, Batman witnesses the harm his selfishness has caused to everyone and slowly accepts his greatest fear. Making a deal with the Zone's gatekeeper Phyllis, a talking Lego brick, to be allowed back to Gotham in order to retrieve the Zone's escaped prisoners, Batman arrives in time to save his teammates, apologizing to them for his actions, and requesting their help to stop Joker.\n\nRealizing that Joker plans to use the explosives he took to destroy the city's Energy Facility, thus causing the city to come apart and be destroyed, Batman turns Barbara into Batgirl, before he, his team, and Gotham City's other villains, who felt neglected by Joker, manage to successfully send the escaped villains back to the Phantom Zone. However, the group fail to stop Joker's bombs going off as the explosion begins to tear the city apart at the plates beneath it. Knowing this was his fault, Batman reluctantly convinces Joker that he is the true reason for being the hero he is before they, their friends and allies, and the city's inhabitants, chain-link themselves together and pull the plates back together, saving the city.\n\nWith the city saved, Batman prepares to be taken back into the Phantom Zone to fulfill his bargain only to be rejected by Phyllis who chooses to let him remain after seeing how much he had changed in order to save everyone. Batman allows Joker and the rest of his rogues gallery to temporarily escape with the confidence that whenever they return, they will be no match for the Batman family.\n\n\nAfter the success of \"The Lego Movie\", Warner Bros. gave the green light to further multiple Lego movies being produced, including \"The Lego Batman Movie\"; Chris McKay, who co-directed \"The Lego Movie\", was brought on board to direct the film, marking this as his solo directorial debut. In an interview about his work on the film, McKay stated that working on the film was \"a very mixed blessing\" owing partly to the film's hectic time schedule for its production, remarking that the two and half years allocated to the film made it difficult to fit in everything that he wanted for the movie, considering his earlier work on \"The Lego Movie\". His work on \"The Lego Batman Movie\" was influenced by the comedy portrayed in both \"The Naked Gun\" and \"Airplane!\" film series, with his pitch for the film to the studios being described as like \"\"Jerry Maguire\" as directed by Michael Mann\". His proposal to combine all the Batman eras featured in the comic book series and various media formats, including movies and comic series, despite a couple of issues—the total inconsistency inherent to such a task, and Lego rejecting some of the characters he proposed to include in the film—was based on his desire of how to portray Robin within the film's setting. In an interview regarding his version of the superhero duo, McKay stated:\n\n\"I was thinking that we were basically taking the Burt Ward Robin and sticking him in the Batmobile with the Zack Snyder/Ben Affleck Batman, or the Frank Miller Batman. And putting these two different energies together. Somebody who’s like the grumpiest, dark grittiest, broodiest Batman with the most positive, indefatigable kid.\"\n\nAs part of its production, the movie was designed to make numerous references to previous \"Batman\" movies, cartoons and comics. These include: the 1940s \"Batman\" serials; the films \"Batman\" (1966), \"Batman\" (1989), \"Batman Returns\" (1992), \"Batman Forever\" (1995), \"Batman & Robin\" (1997), \"Batman Begins\" (2005), \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), \"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012), \"\" (2016), and \"Suicide Squad\" (2016); the television shows \"Batman\" (1960s), \"\" (1990s), \"Batman Beyond\" (2000s), and \"The Batman\" (2000s); and the comics \"Detective Comics\" #27 (Batman's introductory story), \"The Dark Knight Returns\" (1986), and \"Gotham by Gaslight\" (1989). Other references include previous costumes worn by Batman and Robin, and the various Batmobiles used. In most cases, their appearances in the movie are done in a Lego style, with the exception being footage from a live-action shot of Adam West's depiction of Batman in the 1960s \"Batman\" show and a picture of Batman's suit from \"Batman and Robin\". Climactic events from past Batman films including the Joker have been mentioned, including \"that time with the parade and the Prince music\" (1989's \"Batman\") and \"the two boats\" (\"The Dark Knight\").\n\nAlongside Joker, the main antagonist of the film's story, and Superman, who features heavily and has notable links to the Christopher Reeve films \"Superman\" (1978) and its sequel \"Superman II\" (1980), many other DC characters, both villains associated with Batman and other DC superheroes, feature in the film. The film's villains who have been featured in Batman comics, films and cartoons include: Man-Bat; Captain Boomerang; Egghead; Crazy Quilt; Eraser; Polka-Dot Man; Mime; Tarantula; King Tut from the 1960s series; Killer Moth; March Harriet; Zodiac Master; the Mutant Leader from \"The Dark Knight Returns\"; Doctor Phosphorus; Magpie; Calculator; Hugo Strange; an unidentified version of Red Hood; the Kabuki Twins from \"The Batman\"; Orca; Gentleman Ghost; Clock King; Calendar Man; Kite Man; Catman; Zebra-Man; and a variation of Condiment King from \"Batman: The Animated Series\". The other DC heroes who feature, both from the Justice League and \"Super Friends\", include: Wonder Woman; Aquaman; Cyborg; Green Arrow; Black Canary; Hawkman; Hawkgirl; Martian Manhunter; Apache Chief; Black Vulcan; El Dorado; Samurai; Wonder Dog; the Wonder Twins; and Gleek. Although not part of the DC franchise, Iron Man from Marvel Comics is referenced in the movie as part of a small joke about Batman's password for entering the Batcave in reference to the famous rivalry between DC and Marvel.\n\nThe film also features characters from other notable franchises and movie series, with them following the same narrative of \"The Lego Movie\" in that they came from worlds that co-exist alongside others of the Lego Universe, which are made up of Lego playsets of the various media franchises. These additional characters include: Medusa from Lego Minifigures; the Swamp Creature, Evil Mummy, and Lord Vampyre from \"Lego Monster Fighters\"; King Kong; the Daleks from \"Doctor Who\"; the Wicked Witch of the West and her flying monkeys from \"The Wizard of Oz\"; the Kraken from \"Clash of the Titans\"; Agent Smith and his clones from \"The Matrix\"; the great white shark from \"Jaws\"; Voldemort from \"Harry Potter\"; Sauron from \"The Lord of the Rings\"; the Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptors from \"Jurassic Park\"; The Skeleton Warriors from \"Jason and the Argonauts\"; and the Gremlins. The way in which the Gremlins attack a plane references \"The Twilight Zone\" episode \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\".\n\nThe film also includes Batman watching the scene from \"Jerry Maguire\" where Tom Cruise says \"You complete me\"; this line had previously been quoted by The Joker in \"The Dark Knight\". When Batman discusses possible team names, he mentions \"Fox Force Five,\" which was the name of a failed television pilot mentioned in \"Pulp Fiction\". The film's use of Cutting Crew's \"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\" is a nod to the romantic comedy \"Never Been Kissed\". The film's other references include \"Gleaming the Cube\" and \"Gymkata\".\n\nA scene from \"The Lego Movie\" was reused in the film, where Emmet is going down the portal to the real world.\n\nThe film's original score was composed by Lorne Balfe and features Red Hot Chili Peppers' drummer Chad Smith. This makes the film the first, and so far only, film in the franchise to replace Mark Mothersbaugh as composer. The soundtrack was released on February 3, 2017, on CD and for digital download, while the vinyl version was released on May 19, 2017.\n\n\nThe film's world premiere was conducted in Dublin, Ireland on January 29, 2017, whereupon it went into general release from February 8; it was released in Denmark on February 9, and in the United States the day after. Its overall release saw movie theatres displaying the film in 3D, RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema and IMAX, though the latter format was restricted to 2D for North America, while international countries were able to view it in IMAX 3D.\n\nThe first teaser trailer for \"The Lego Batman Movie\" was released on March 24, 2016, and features the song \"Black and Yellow\" by Wiz Khalifa. It was attached to showings of \"\" in theatres. A second teaser trailer was released on March 28, 2016, and features references to all live-action iterations of Batman, from the 1960s \"Batman\" TV series to \"Batman v Superman\". A third trailer was released on July 23, 2016. A fourth trailer was released on November 4, 2016. Over twenty Lego sets inspired by scenes from the film were released for the film including two sets of Collectible Minifigures. A Story Pack for the toys-to-life video game \"Lego Dimensions\" based on \"The Lego Batman Movie\" was released on February 10, 2017, alongside the film. The pack adds a six-level story campaign adapting the events of the film, and includes playable figures of Robin and Batgirl, a driveable Batwing, and a constructible gateway model based on the Batcomputer. A Fun Pack including Excalibur Batman and his Bionic Steed was also released the same day.\n\nOn January 14, 2017, at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Chevrolet unveiled a life-sized Lego Batmobile inspired by the design featured in the film, constructed from around 350,000 Lego pieces. As a related promotion, a Bat-Signal (alternating between Batman's emblem and the Chevrolet logo) was projected on the Renaissance Center over the weekend, and Chevrolet released a new television commercial tying into the film, featuring the Batmobile as a crossover with its ongoing \"Real People, Not Actors\" campaign.\n\nWarner Bros. released several promotional tie-ins on the week of the movie's release. LEGO billboard versions of several TV shows were shown outside of the studio lot, that took 300 hours to make out of 10,000 bricks. \"The Big Bang Theory\" included a LEGO version of the opening sequence in the episode \"The Locomotion Reverberation\" that first aired on CBS. In addition, the network aired two LEGO commercials featuring Batman and the cast.\n\nThe CW featured LEGO end cards for \"Supergirl\", \"The Flash\", \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow\", and \"Arrow\", respectively, on the week of the movie's release. All four DC shows also include a special variant of the Berlanti Productions logo that featured Batman's cameo and a new recording from Greg Berlanti's real-life father who says \"Batman move your head\" instead of the usual \"Greg move your head\". In addition, the network aired two commercials where Batman interacts with the characters from each show.\n\n\"The Lego Batman Movie\" was released on Digital HD on May 19, 2017. The release included the theatrical short film \"The Master: A Lego Ninjago Short\", as well as four new short films: \"Dark Hoser\", \"Batman is Just Not That Into You\", \"Cooking with Alfred\" and \"Movie Sound Effects: How Do They Do That?.\" \"The Lego Batman Movie\" was released on DVD, Blu-ray (2D and 3D), and Ultra HD Blu-ray by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on June 13, 2017. The film debuted at No. 3 on the NPD VideoScan overall disc sales chart.\n\n\"The Lego Batman Movie\" grossed $175.8 million in the United States and Canada and $136.2 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $311.9 million, against a production budget of $80 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"The Lego Batman Movie\" opened alongside two other sequels, \"Fifty Shades Darker\" and \"\", and was projected to gross around $60 million in its opening weekend. It earned $2.2 million from Thursday-night previews and $15 million on Friday. It went on to open with $53 million, finishing first at the box office. In its second weekend, the film grossed $32.7 million (a drop of 38.4%), again topping the box office; with the additional President's Day holiday on Monday, it made a total of $42.7 million for the weekend. In its third weekend of release, the film dropped to second at the box office, behind newcomer \"Get Out\", grossing $19.2 million (a drop of 41.2%).\n\nOutside North America the film was simultaneously released in 61 countries, and was expected to gross around $40 million over its first three days. It ended up grossing $37 million in its opening weekend, including $9.3 million in the United Kingdom, $2.6 million in Mexico, $2.3 million in Germany and $2.2 million in Russia.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 281 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"The Lego Batman Movie\" continues its block-buster franchise's winning streak with another round of dizzyingly funny—and beautifully animated—family-friendly mayhem.\" It was ranked the 14th best superhero movie of all time on the site. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nMike Ryan of \"Uproxx\" gave the film a positive review, praising its comedy, and saying: \"\"The LEGO Batman Movie\" isn’t the same experience as watching \"The LEGO Movie\", but I also don’t think it's trying to be. It’s trying to be a fun superhero movie with clever callbacks to previous Batman films (every single Batman movie all the way back to the 1940s serials are referenced) that can, at least, provide DC superhero fans with a taste of fun amidst all the doom and gloom. (That can either be a reference to 'the real world' or the current DC Cinematic Universe films, you can choose either one you want or both.) And at that, \"The LEGO Batman Movie\" succeeds.\" Chris Nashawaty of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a \"B+\" and wrote, \"\"LEGO Batman\" revs so fast and moves so frenetically that it becomes a little exhausting by the end. It flirts with being too much of a good thing. But rarely has corporate brainwashing been so much fun and gone down with such a delightful aftertaste.\" Justin Chang of the \"Los Angeles Times\" was positive in his review, saying, \"In its best moments, this gag-a-minute Bat-roast serves as a reminder that, in the right hands, a sharp comic scalpel can be an instrument of revelation as well as ridicule.\" Michael O'Sullivan of \"The Washington Post\" praised the film for its heart, humor, and action which, \"snap together, with a satisfying click.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "7360160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7360160", "title": "Upsy Downsy", "text": "Upsy Downsy\n\nUpsy Downsy is a brand developed by Mattel. It concerns two races of strange beings, one that lives rightside-up (The Upsys), the other upside-down (The Downsys). These psychedelic creatures and their fantasy world were featured in a short-lived line of colorful toys and story books for young children in 1969.\n\nThe toys were small plastic characters with fabric clothing and synthetic yarn hair, all in fantastic, garishly bright colors. Each came with a fold-out cardboard Playland mat, a \"Magic Bridge Clip\" to link one mat to another, some wild (and often quite fragile!) accessories, a mode of transportation, and a name that summed up their character in a few nonsensical words. All of the individual Playland mats were designed to be placed together using the Bridge Clips to make the \"Happidiculous World\" of The Upsys and Downsys. The Upsy figures were approximately 2-1/2\" tall, basically humanoid in shape, with tiny bodies and huge oversized heads topped with a large bright yarn pompom for hair. The Downsys, on the other hand, were more cartoonish beings, about 4\" in height with wild, goofy faces in the middle of a large, rounded body. Downsys' hands are positioned on the tops of their heads, to allow them to stand upside-down.\n\n\nLike many things in Upsy Downsy Land, the gender of little Baby So-High, the infant pilot, appears a bit confused. In most instances, including all of the books and even the back of the toy's original packaging, Baby is referred to as a \"she\". But the bright billboard that came in that same package proclaims:\n\n\"Air Show Today!\nSee Baby So-High Fly \"his\" Airo-Zoomer!\" (emphasis added)\n\n\nFor reasons that remain unclear, the name of Miss Information's Round-Eared, Three-Wheeled, Orange and Turquoise Conveyance has been popularly misnamed by many sources as \"Booth Moose\". While most of the Upsy vehicles seem to have been based on a particular animal (Piggybus springs to mind), the Downsy rigs are not so designed or constrained. And seeing that The Miss Information Booth hasn't anything remotely resembling antlers, this writer cannot see the remotest basis for this incorrect name.\n\nWiz-z-zers are gyro-powered toy tops that spin crazily when their tips are wound. Produced in many incarnations by Mattel during the late 1960s and well into the '1970s, these wild whirring tops were a perfect fit for the Upsy Downsy line, and were adapted as a pair of bizarre spinning vehicles, each coming with its own exclusive pilot character. Mattel inadvertently reversed the names of the two Wiz-z-zer-riding characters in the group cast picture shown on the backs of the toy Play Mats, making the whole endeavor all the more confused.\n\nThe Happy Go-Round Playset features a dazzling three-car carousel. The cars in question are Bugabouts (similar to Tickle Pinkle's car, but in different colors), which are connected to the central umbrella support by a three-way axle, so that all the cars rotate around the wobbly platform at once. The Set also includes an extra-large Playland Mat, a Magic Bridge Clip, a streetlamp, a fence, an Upsy Downsy Daisy, and most importantly, exclusive Upsy patrons Foozie Woozie and Tingle Dingle.\n\nThe Funny Feeder is the Downsy Land Hamburger Stand. The strange contraption features a spring-loaded tongue sticking out of its huge, grinning mouth (the better to toss plastic hamburgers towards customers with). The Feeder is manned by Downsy cook Short Order and Gooey Chooey, who has been characterized as either Short Order's waitress, or his best customer, or possibly BOTH (the books were kinda vague). The Set came with an oversized Playland Mat, a Magic Bridge Clip, a fence, a streetlamp, a Billboard (Advertising \"Downside-Up Burgers\"), a serving tray, and three of the afore-mentioned burgers, ready for launching.\n\nEight of the main Upsy Downsy characters were spotlighted in a series of lush, colorful (and slightly psychedelic) Storybooks that chronicled their crazy adventures.\n\nThere was also a larger book, \"Welcome to Upsy Downsy Land\", which introduced the Happidiculous World and its inhabitants as a whole.\n\nThis book told of the surreal origins of the Upsys and Downsys. They were once merely flowers, covering an entire world made of fuzzy dandelions. A sentient wind called The Great Huff passed by this world long ago, and, having his nose tickled by the dandelions, blew them all away. As the dandelions fell back to earth, some of them fell through a rainbow, and were magically changed into rightside-up beings known as Upsys. Other dandelions fell through a storm cloud, and became upside-down creatures called Downsys. The two factions, despite each being the others' polar opposite, got along famously, and developed their own little civilization, which came to be known as \"Upsy Downsy Land\".\n\n\n\n\nfan site : http://upsydownsyland.com/\n"}

The comic uses animals as an allegory for nations and sovereign states to represent political and military events in history. The goal of this project was to promote nationalistic pride in young people, and focuses on appreciation for China's various achievements since the beginning of the 20th century. It was originally not intended for foreign audiences, but when the animated series gained popularity after its first season, the creators stopped planning episodes in strict chronological order so as to be able to portray countries with the most screen time in a positive light more often.\n\nAn animated adaptation of the series started airing on the Internet in March 2015 and a free-to-play strategy video game based on it was released on iOS and Android in July 2015.\n\nOn March 5, 2015, an animated series started airing on the Internet. Three seasons had been produced by the time the series concluded on March 8, 2017. The theme song \"Zhuī Mèng Chìzǐ Xīn\" (追梦赤子心; lit. \"Dream Pursuer with Childish Heart\") was performed by the Chinese band .\n\nA free-to-play strategy role-playing video game based on the webcomic, was released on iOS and Android on July 15, 2015. The player controls one of three factions: Hare, Bald Eagle and Bear.\n\nThe comic expresses the modern history of China and its international relations in a fun way. It has sparked patriotism in China's younger generations.\n\nHare (Chinese: 我兔. \"lit. We the rabbit\") is now used as positive Internet slang referring to China.\n\nCreators of an anti-\"Year Hare Affair\" Facebook community page believe this comic is a sign of rising of Chinese chauvinism and Sinocentrism, thus mocking the titular \"That Rabbit\" by calling him \"Nazi Rabbit\" caused by the identical pronunciation of \"that\" and the abbreviation for the word \"Nazi\".\n\nThe historical vision, provided in first two seasons of \"Year Hare Affair\", came under heavy criticism in an overview on the Russian website South China Insight, especially Sino-Soviet relations. Though it is admitted that relations with Russia \"occupy a leading place\" in reflecting of Chinese history, but with a \"complete disregard for historical facts\", such as Soviet involvement in the CPC's foundation and the Red Army's liberation of Manchuria from Japanese forces. It was also noted that the Sino-Vietnamese War has been completely left behind.\n\nOiwan Lam of Global Voices Online finds racism in portraying the African as a hippopotamus, which she considers \"a lazy and stupid animal\". In that regard, \"China's aid for Africa has also been simplified as a last resort because 'the first world refused to play with us'.\"\n\nThe second and third season received 8.6 and 8.4 points out of 10 on Douban.\n\n"}
