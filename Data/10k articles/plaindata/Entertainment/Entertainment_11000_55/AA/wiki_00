{"id": "14482638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14482638", "title": "Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)", "text": "Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)\n\nAlice in Wonderland is a 2010 American dark fantasy adventure film directed by Tim Burton from a screenplay written by Linda Woolverton. The film stars Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, Crispin Glover, Matt Lucas and Mia Wasikowska, and features the voices of Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, and Timothy Spall. Loosely inspired by Lewis Carroll's fantasy novels, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass\", the film tells the story of a nineteen-year-old Alice Kingsleigh, who is told that she can restore the White Queen to her throne, with the help of the Mad Hatter. She is the only one who can slay the Jabberwock, a dragon-like creature that is controlled by the Red Queen and terrorizes Underland's inhabitants.\n\nThe film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and shot in the United Kingdom and the United States. The film premiered in London at the Odeon Leicester Square on February 25, 2010, and was released in Australia on March 4, 2010, and the following day in the United Kingdom and the United States through the Disney Digital 3D, RealD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats as well as in conventional theaters. It is also the second-highest-grossing film of 2010.\n\n\"Alice in Wonderland\" received mixed reviews upon release; although praised for its visual style and special effects, the film was criticized for its lack of narrative coherence and overuse of computer-generated imagery (CGI). The film received three nominations at the 68th Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. At the 83rd Academy Awards, \"Alice in Wonderland\" won Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design, and was also nominated for Best Visual Effects. The film generated over $1 billion in ticket sales and became the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run.\n\nThe film started a trend of live-action fairy tale and fantasy films being green-lit, particularly from Walt Disney Studios.\n\nA sequel, titled \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\", was released on May 27, 2016.\n\nTroubled by a strange recurring dream and mourning the loss of her father, 19-year-old Alice Kingsleigh attends a garden party at Lord Ascot's estate. There, she is confronted by an unwanted marriage proposal to Lord Ascot's son, Hamish, and the stifling expectations of the society in which she lives. Unsure of how to proceed, she pursues a rabbit wearing a blue waistcoat and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole under a tree. She emerges in a forest where she is greeted by the White Rabbit, the Dormouse, the Dodo, the Talking Flowers, and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. They argue over whether Alice is \"the right Alice\" who must slay the Red Queen's Jabberwocky and restore the White Queen to power, as foretold by Absolem the Caterpillar and his prophetic scroll. The group is then ambushed by the Bandersnatch and a group of playing-card soldiers led by the Knave of Hearts. Alice, Tweedledum and Tweedledee escape into the woods. The Knave steals the Caterpillar's scroll. The Dormouse leaves the others behind with one of the Bandersnatch's eyes in her possession. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are then captured by the Red Queen's Jubjub bird.\n\nThe Knave informs the Red Queen that Alice threatens her reign, and the soldiers and Bayard the Bloodhound are ordered to find Alice immediately. Meanwhile, the Cheshire Cat guides Alice to the March Hare and the Mad Hatter. The Hatter helps Alice avoid capture by allowing himself to be seized instead. Later, Alice is found by the Bloodhound, but Alice insists upon helping the Hatter. At the Red Queen's citadel and palace, the Red Queen is unaware of Alice's true identity and therefore welcomes her as a guest. Alice learns that the vorpal sword, the only weapon capable of killing the Jabberwocky, is locked inside the den of the Bandersnatch. The Knave attempts to seduce Alice, but she rebuffs him, causing a jealous Red Queen to order that Alice be beheaded. Alice obtains the sword and befriends the Bandersnatch by returning its eye. She then escapes on the back of the grateful Bandersnatch and delivers the sword to the White Queen. The Cheshire Cat saves the Hatter from the executioner, and the Hatter calls for rebellion against the Red Queen. The rebellion is quickly put down by the Jubjub bird, but the resistance flees to the White Queen's castle, and both armies prepare for battle. Absolem advises Alice to fight the Jabberwocky just before completing his transformation into a pupa.\n\nOn the appointed day, the White Queen and the Red Queen gather their armies on a chessboard-like battlefield and send Alice and the Jabberwocky to decide the battle in single combat. Encouraged by the advice of her late father, Alice fights the Jabberwocky among the ruins surrounding the battlefield and finally jumps from the remains of a spiral staircase onto the Jabberwocky's neck and beheads it. During this fight, a catapult stone kills the Jubjub bird. As punishment for their crimes, the White Queen banishes the Red Queen and the Knave into exile together. The Knave attempts to kill the Red Queen, yet the Hatter protects the Red Queen from his attack. After the Hatter performs a celebration dance called Futterwacken, the White Queen gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood whose power will bring her whatever she wishes. She decides to rejoin the everyday world after saying farewell to her friends. Back in England, Alice impresses Lord Ascot with her idea of establishing oceanic trade routes to Hong Kong, inspiring him to take her as his apprentice. As the story closes, Alice prepares to set off on a trading ship. A light-blue butterfly with dark vein markings lands on her shoulder, and Alice recognizes him as Absolem.\n\nTim Burton signed with Walt Disney Pictures to direct two films in Disney Digital 3D, which included \"Alice in Wonderland\" and his remake of \"Frankenweenie\". Burton developed the story because he never felt an emotional tie to the original book.\n\nHe explained \"the goal is to try to make it an engaging movie where you get some of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of \"Alice\".\" On prior versions, Burton said \"It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and I never really felt any real emotional connection.\" His goal with the new film is to give the story \"some framework of emotional grounding\" and \"to try and make \"Alice\" feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events.\" Burton focused on the poem \"Jabberwocky\" as part of his structure, and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name \"Jabberwock\" used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing \"Alice\" film nor as a \"re-imagining\". However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game \"American McGee's Alice\", and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.\n\nThis film was originally set to be released in 2009 but was pushed back to March 5, 2010. Principal photography was scheduled for May 2008, but did not begin until September and concluded in three months. Scenes set in the Victorian era were shot at Torpoint and Plymouth from September 1 to October 14 (Mia Wasikowska's birthday). Two hundred and fifty local extras were chosen in early August. Locations included Antony House in Torpoint, Charlestown, Cornwall and the Barbican, however, no footage from the Barbican was used. Motion capture filming began in early October at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California, though the footage was later discarded. Filming also took place at Culver Studios. Burton said that he used a combination of live action and animation, without motion capture. He also noted that this was the first time he had filmed on a green screen. Filming of the green screen portions, comprising 90% of the film, was completed after only 40 days. Many of the cast and crew felt nauseated as a result of the long hours surrounded by green, and Burton had lavender lenses fitted into his glasses to counteract the effect. Due to the constant need for digital effects to distort the actors' physical appearances, such as the size of the Red Queen's head or Alice's height, visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston cited the film as being exhausting, saying it was \"The biggest show I've ever done, [and] the most creatively involved I've ever been.\"\n\nSony Pictures Imageworks designed the visual effects sequences. Burton felt 3D was appropriate to the story's environment. Burton and Zanuck chose to film with conventional cameras, and convert the footage into 3D during post-production; Zanuck explained 3D cameras were too expensive and \"clumsy\" to use, and they felt that there was no difference between converted footage and those shot in the format. James Cameron, who released his 3D film \"Avatar\" in December 2009, criticized the choice, stating, \"It doesn't make any sense to shoot in 2-D and convert to 3-D\".\n\nLongtime Burton collaborator Danny Elfman's score was released March 2, 2010. It debuted at #89 on the \"Billboard\" Top 200 albums chart.\n\n\"Almost Alice\" is a collection of various artists' music inspired by the film. The lead single, \"Alice\" by Avril Lavigne, premiered on January 27, 2010 on Ryan Seacrest's radio program. Other singles include \"Follow Me Down\" by 3OH!3, \"Her Name Is Alice\" by Shinedown, and \"Tea Party\" by Kerli. The album was released on March 2, 2010.\n\nOn February 12, 2010, major UK cinema chains, Odeon, Vue, and Cineworld, had planned to boycott the film because of a reduction of the interval between cinema and DVD release from the usual 17 weeks to 12 (possibly to avoid the release of the DVD clashing with the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which was Disney's pretext for cutting short \"Alice\"s theatrical run but UK exhibitors protested that Alice would be less threatened by the World Cup than other titles). A week after the announcement, Cineworld, who has a 24% share of UK box office, chose to play the film on more than 150 screens. Cineworld's chief executive Steve Wiener stated, \"As leaders in 3D, we did not want the public to miss out on such a visual spectacle. As the success of \"Avatar\" has shown, there is currently a huge appetite for the 3D experience\". Shortly after, the Vue cinema chain also reached an agreement with Disney, but Odeon had still chosen to boycott in Britain, Ireland, and Italy. On February 25, 2010 Odeon had reached an agreement and decided to show the film on March 5, 2010. The Royal premiere took place at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on February 25, 2010 for the fundraiser The Prince's Foundation for Children and The Arts where the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall attended. It also did not affect their plans to show the film in Spain, Germany, Portugal, and Austria. The film was released in the U.S. and UK, in both Disney Digital 3D and IMAX 3D, as well as regular theaters on March 5, 2010.\n\nOn June 22, 2009, the first pictures of the film were released, showing Depp as the Mad Hatter, Hathaway as the White Queen, Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum. A new image of Alice was also released. In July, new photos emerged of Alice holding a white rabbit, the Mad Hatter with a hare, the Red Queen holding a pig, and the White Queen with a mouse.\n\nOn July 22, 2009, a teaser trailer from the Mad Hatter's point of view was released on IGN but was shortly taken down because Disney claimed that the trailer was not supposed to be out yet. The teaser was also planned to premiere along with a trailer of Robert Zemeckis' film adaptation of \"A Christmas Carol\" on July 24, 2009 for \"G-Force\". The following day, the teaser trailer premiered at Comic-Con but the trailer shown was different from the one that leaked. The ComicCon version didn't have the Mad Hatter's dialogue. Instead, it featured \"Time to Pretend\" by MGMT, and the clips shown were in different order than in the leaked version. The leaked version was originally to be shown to one of the three Facebook groups used to promote the film that had the most members. The groups used to promote the film are \"The Loyal Subjects of the Red Queen\", \"The Loyal Subjects of the White Queen\" and \"The Disloyal Subjects of the Mad Hatter\".\n\nAlso at ComicCon, props from the film were displayed in an \"Alice in Wonderland\" exhibit. Costumes featured in the exhibit included the Red Queen's dress, chair, wig, glasses, and scepter; the White Queen's dress, wig and a small model of her castle; the Mad Hatter's suit, hat, wig, chair and table; Alice's dress and battle armor (to slay the Jabberwocky). Other props included the \"DRINK ME\" bottles, the keys, an \"EAT ME\" pastry and stand-in models of the White Rabbit and March Hare.\n\nA nighttime party area at the Disney California Adventure theme park was created, called \"Mad T Party\".\n\nOn July 23, 2009, Disney Interactive Studios announced that an \"Alice in Wonderland\" video game, developed by French game studio Étranges Libellules, would be released in the same week as the film for the Wii, Nintendo DS, and Microsoft Windows. The soundtrack was composed by video games music composer Richard Jacques. The Wii, DS, and PC versions were released on March 2, 2010.\n\nDisney Interactive released in 2013 the game \"Alice in Wonderland: A New Champion\" for iOS.\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released a three-disc Blu-ray combo pack (which includes the Blu-ray, DVD and a digital copy), single-disc Blu-ray and single-disc DVD on June 1, 2010 in North America and July 1, 2010 in Australia. The DVD release includes three short features about the making of the film, focusing on Burton's vision for Wonderland and the characters of Alice and the Mad Hatter. The Blu-ray version has nine additional featurettes centered on additional characters, special effects and other aspects of the film's production. In some confusion, a small number of copies were put on shelves a week before schedule in smaller stores, but were quickly removed, although a handful of copies were confirmed purchased ahead of schedule.\n\nIn its first week of release (June 1–6, 2010), it sold 2,095,878 DVD units (equivalent to $35,441,297) and topped the DVD sales chart for two continuous weeks. By May 22, 2011, it had sold 4,313,680 units ($76,413,043). It failed to crack the 2010 top ten DVDs list in terms of units sold, but reached 10th place on that chart in terms of sales revenue.\n\n\"Alice in Wonderland\" has grossed $334,191,110 in North America and $691,276,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $1,025,467,110 against a budget of $200 million. Worldwide, it is currently the thirtieth-highest-grossing film and the second-highest-grossing 2010 film. It is the third-highest-grossing film starring Johnny Depp, the highest-grossing film directed by Tim Burton. The second-highest-grossing film of Anne Hathaway and the second-highest-grossing children's book adaptation (worldwide, as well as in North America and outside North America separately).\n\nOn its first weekend, the film made $220.1 million worldwide, marking the second-largest opening ever for a movie not released during the summer or the holiday period (behind \"The Hunger Games\"), the fourth-largest for a Disney-distributed film and the fourth-largest among 2010 films. It dominated for three consecutive weekends at the worldwide box office. On May 26, 2010, its 85th day of release, it became the sixth film ever to surpass the $1 billion mark and the second film that had been released by Walt Disney Studios that did so.\n\nIn North America, \"Alice in Wonderland\" is the forty-fourth-highest-grossing film but out of the top 100 when adjusted for inflation. It is also the second-highest-grossing 2010 film, behind \"Toy Story 3\", the second-highest-grossing film starring Johnny Depp and the highest-grossing film directed by Tim Burton. The film opened on March 5, 2010, on approximately 7,400 screens at 3,728 theaters with $40,804,962 during its first day, $3.9 million of which came from midnight showings, ranking number one and setting a new March opening-day record. \"Alice\" earned $116.1 million on its opening weekend, breaking the record for the largest opening weekend in March (previously held by \"300\"), the record for the largest opening weekend during springtime (previously held by \"Fast and Furious\"), the largest opening weekend for a non-sequel (previously held by \"Spider-Man\") and the highest one for the non-holiday, non-summer period. However, all of these records were broken by \"The Hunger Games\" ($152.5 million) in March 2012. \"Alice\" made the seventeenth-highest-grossing opening weekend ever and the fifth-largest among 3D films. Opening-weekend grosses originating from 3D showings were $81.3 million (70% of total weekend gross). This broke the record for the largest opening-weekend 3D grosses but it was later topped by \"Marvel's The Avengers\" ($108 million). It had the largest weekend per-theater average of 2010 ($31,143 per theater) and the largest for a PG-rated film. It broke the IMAX opening-weekend record by earning $12.2 million on 188 IMAX screens, with an average of $64,197 per site. The record was first overtaken by \"Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" ($15.2 million). \"Alice\" remained in first place for three consecutive weekends at the North American box office. \"Alice\" closed in theaters on July 8, 2010 with $334.2 million.\n\nOutside North America, \"Alice\" is the thirteenth-highest-grossing film, the highest-grossing 2010 film, the fourth-highest-grossing Disney film, the second-highest-grossing film starring Johnny Depp and the highest-grossing film directed by Tim Burton. It began with an estimated $94 million, on top of the weekend box office, and remained at the summit for four consecutive weekends and five in total. Japan was the film's highest-grossing country after North America, with $133.7 million, followed by the UK, Ireland and Malta ($64.4 million), and France and the Maghreb region ($45.9 million).\n\nReview aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 52% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 267 reviews; the average score is 5.7/10. The consensus is: \"Tim Burton's \"Alice\" sacrifices the book's minimal narrative coherence—and much of its heart—but it's an undeniable visual treat\". Metacritic rated it 53/100 based on 38 reviews.\n\nTodd McCarthy of \"Variety\" praised it for its \"moments of delight, humor and bedazzlement\", but went on to say, \"But it also becomes more ordinary as it goes along, building to a generic battle climax similar to any number of others in CGI-heavy movies of the past few years\". Michael Rechtshaffen of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said \"Burton has delivered a subversively witty, brilliantly cast, whimsically appointed dazzler that also manages to hit all the emotionally satisfying marks\", while as well praising its computer-generated imagery (CGI), saying \"Ultimately, it's the visual landscape that makes Alice's newest adventure so wondrous, as technology has finally been able to catch up with Burton's endlessly fertile imagination.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said, \"But Burton's Disneyfied 3-D \"Alice in Wonderland\", written by the girl-power specialist Linda Woolverton, is a strange brew indeed: murky, diffuse, and meandering, set not in a Wonderland that pops with demented life but in a world called Underland that's like a joyless, bombed-out version of Wonderland. It looks like a CGI head trip gone post apocalyptic. In the film's rather humdrum 3-D, the place doesn't dazzle—it droops.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" awarded the film three out of four stars and wrote in his review that, \"\"Alice\" plays better as an adult hallucination, which is how Burton rather brilliantly interprets it until a pointless third act flies off the rails.\" The market research firm CinemaScore found that audiences gave the film an average rating of \"A-\".\n\nSeveral reviews criticized the decision to turn Alice into a \"colonialist entrepreneur\" at the end of the film setting sail for China. Given Britain's role in the First and Second Opium Wars during the Victorian era and the foreign domination of China through \"unequal treaties\", China expert Kevin Slaten writes, \"Not only is it troubling imagery, for a female role model in a Disney movie, but it's also a celebration of the exploitation that China suffered for a century.\"\n\nGame developer American McGee, best known for creating \"Alice\" and \"\", was asked in a 2011 interview about Tim Burton's interpretation of the title character since both versions share almost similar dark and twisted tone of Wonderland. McGee praised the film's visuals and audio but criticized the lack of screen time Alice had compared to the other characters. He felt Alice did not have any purpose in the story and that she was merely used as a \"tool\".\n\nAfter the release and success of the movie, Walt Disney Pictures has announced the development of several live-action adaptations of their Animated Classics series. \"Maleficent\", \"Cinderella\", \"The Jungle Book\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Christopher Robin\" have followed to similar box-office results with the latter four also earning critical praise. Disney has also announced the development of live-action adaptations of \"Dumbo\", \"Aladdin\", \"The Lion King\", \"Mulan\", \"Pinocchio\", \"Fantasia\", \"The Sword in the Stone\", \"The Black Cauldron\", \"Peter Pan\", \"The Little Mermaid\", \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", \"Lady and the Tramp\", and \"Lilo & Stitch\". The company also has plans for live-action spin-offs of \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\", \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", and \"Peter Pan\" along with a live-action prequel to \"Aladdin\".\n\nStage adaptation Walt Disney Theatrical is in early talks with Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton to develop the property as a Broadway musical. Woolverton authored the screenplay for Disney's \"The Lion King\" and is also the Tony Award-nominated book writer of \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Aida\", and \"\". Burton will also render the overall designs for the stage musical. Woolverton will adapt her screenplay for the stage production. Neither a composer nor songwriting team has been chosen yet. Direction and choreography will be done by Rob Ashford. The musical is aiming to make its world-premiere in London.\n\nOn December 7, 2012, \"Variety\" announced the development of a sequel to \"Alice in Wonderland\". Linda Woolverton returned to write a screenplay. On May 31, 2013, James Bobin began talks to direct the sequel under the working title \"Alice in Wonderland: Into the Looking Glass.\" Johnny Depp returned as The Hatter, Mia Wasikowska reprised the role of Alice, and Helena Bonham Carter returned as the Red Queen. Several other cast members from the 2010 film also reprised their roles in the sequel. On November 22, 2013, it was announced that the sequel will be released on May 27, 2016 and that Bobin would direct the film. Rhys Ifans and Sacha Baron Cohen are featured in the film. On January 21, 2014, the film was again retitled to \"Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass\". The title was later reworked once again to \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "70499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70499", "title": "Alto", "text": "Alto\n\nThe musical term alto, meaning \"high\" in (Latin: ), refers to the second highest part of a contrapuntal musical texture and is also applied to its associated vocal range, especially in choral music. It is also the root word of contralto, the lowest standard female voice type. When designating instruments, \"alto\" likewise can refer either to the corresponding vocal range (alto flute and alto trombone) or to musical role (alto recorder and alto clarinet). The term \"alto\" is also used to designate a specific kind of musical clef; see alto clef.\n\nIn choral music for mixed voices, \"alto\" describes the lowest part commonly sung by women. The explanation for the anomaly of this name is to be found not in the use of adult falsettists in choirs of men and boys but further back in innovations in composition during the mid-15th century. Before this time it was usual to write a melodic \"cantus\" or \"superius\" against a tenor (from Latin \"tenere\", to hold) or 'held' part, to which might be added a contratenor, which was in counterpoint with (in other words, against = contra) the tenor. The composers of Ockeghem's generation wrote two contratenor parts and designated them as \"contratenor altus\" and \"contratenor bassus\"; they were respectively higher and lower than the tenor part. From these derive both the modern terms \"alto\" (and contralto) and \"bass\".\n\nIn SATB four-part mixed chorus, the alto is the second highest vocal range, above the tenor and bass and below the soprano. The alto range in choral music is approximately from F (the F below middle C) to F (the F in the second octave above middle C). In common usage, alto is used to describe the voice type that typically sings this part, though this is not strictly correct. Alto, like the other three standard modern choral voice classifications (soprano, tenor and bass) was originally intended to describe a part within a homophonic or polyphonic texture, rather than an individual voice type; neither are the terms alto and contralto interchangeable or synonymous, though they are often treated as such.\n\nAlthough some women who sing alto in a choir are contraltos, many would be more accurately called mezzo-sopranos (a voice of somewhat higher range and different timbre), and many male countertenors (this latter term is a source of considerable controversy, some authorities preferring the usage of the term \"male alto\" for those countertenors who use a predominantly falsetto voice production).\n\nThe contralto voice is a matter of vocal timbre and tessitura as well as range, and a classically trained solo contralto would usually have a range greater than that of a normal choral alto part in both the upper and lower ranges. However, the vocal tessitura of a classically trained contralto would still make these singers more comfortable singing in the lower part of the voice. A choral non-solo contralto may also have a low range down to D (thus perhaps finding it easier to sing the choral tenor part), but some would have difficulty singing above E. In a choral context mezzo-sopranos and contraltos might sing the alto part, together with countertenors, thus having three vocal timbres (and two means of vocal production) singing the same notes.\n\nAlto is rarely used to describe a solo voice (except in the case of soloists in choral works), though there is a multitude of terms in common usage in various languages and in different cultures for solo singers in this range. Examples include contralto, countertenor, \"haute-contre\", and \"tenor altino\" among others.\n\n\n"}

The game is set in the Aztec period, with characters and story being re-interpretations of Aztec mythology and pre-Hispanic Mexican culture. It puts the player in the role of an Aztec warrior named \"Huitzilo\" who must gather seven phonographs to save his civilization from its angry gods.\n\nThe gameplay is reminiscent of an old-school action role-playing game. The player climbs, crawls and jumps his way around a level to explore it and find new items. Experience points are gained for every enemy killed, and they are spent to upgrade the character's attributes and special skills. There is also an inventory screen where discovered items can be equipped and where merchandise bought from merchants (like potions) can be used.\n\nThe game is controlled with the WASD keys and the mouse. The keyboard makes Huitzilo move and jump like in a platform game. The mouse is used to drag-and-drop on-screen energy particles. Doing this allows the player to modify parts of the game world, as well as unlock a variety of doorways or pick-up previously unattainable items. As the player progresses in the game, he gains containers that allows him to store on-screen energy particles for later use. The mouse is also used to cast spells, both offensive and defensive, by selecting them from the bottom-screen magic inventory and then clicking at on-screen targets in succession to launch them.\n\nArtwork throughout the game reflects historical Mesoamerica, with square-shaped pyramids, stone temples, mystic engravings, dense jungles, and barren mountaintops.

Aztaka puts the player in the role of an Aztec warrior named \"Huitzilo\" who must gather seven phonographs to save his civilization from its angry gods.\n\nAztaka was developed by Citérémis, a Canadian independent game developer with demo releases publicly available in begin 2009. The game was released as DRM-free digital self-distribution on the developer's website in May 2009. Later in 2009 the game was also sold also on Steam and Direct2Drive. In 2011, Citérémis offered a \"Developer's Edition\" for a limited period of time (7 to 31 January 2011). This edition was priced $19.99 (normal version $9.99) and included the source code of the game, as well as the Art book and soundtrack.\n\nIn 2012 the game was part of a game bundle sale.\n\nThe game was received by press and game news websites overall good to mixed. Aztaka was mentioned in an article about indie game development in March 2012 in Italian magazine The Games Machine. Aztaka received the Game Tunnel \"Gold award 2009\". According to the developer himself in 2011 the game earned not enough to cover the expenses and would have been therefore a commercial failure. On the other hand, Steamspy reported in 2017 40,000 owners which would indicate at least a covering of the expenses.\n\n"}

A choreographer is one who creates choreographies by practicing the art of choreography, a process known as \"choreographing\". Choreography is used in a variety of fields, including musical theater, cheerleading, cinematography, gymnastics, fashion shows, ice skating, marching band, show choir, theatre, synchronized swimming, cardistry, video game production and animated art. In the performing arts, choreography applies to human movement and form. In dance, choreography is also known as dance choreography or \"dance composition\".\n\nThe word \"choreography\" literally means \"dance-writing\" from the Greek words \"χορεία\" (circular dance, see choreia) and \"γραφή\" (writing). It first appeared in the American English dictionary in the 1950s, and \"choreographer\" was first used as a credit for George Balanchine in the Broadway show \"On Your Toes\" in 1936. Before this, stage credits and movie credits used phrases such as \"ensembles staged by\", \"dances staged by\", or simply \"dances by\" to denote the choreographer.\n\n"}

The series takes the form of a mockumentary following Duke and Cera's ambitions to write and sell a pilot for a television series.\n\nDuke and Cera play fictionalized versions of themselves, Cera describing the characters as \"more idiotic and more deluded\". The series is a low-budget affair, filmed on handheld cameras by friends of the duo. The cameras are acknowledged by Clark, Michael and others, who will sometimes address them or those operating them; in one scene, an upset Michael shouts a cameraman out of the bathroom, after which Clark angrily points out to the crew that their contract states \"no bathroom stuff\". Boom mics are often visible, and the crew have also intervened in fights between Clark and Michael.\n\nClark and Michael's ambition of producing their own television series is stated in the opening of the first episode, and forms the drive of the series. After being turned down initially, the pair come to terms with the fact that success will not be instantaneous, and continue to pursue new opportunities. Though their agent succeeds in scheduling a meeting to discuss their show with another network, Clark's drunken behavior changes their mind about picking up the show. Following this, the pair has a meeting with agent Ramsay, who recommends that Michael be made the \"hero\" of the series. Bothered by this, Clark reveals an idea for his own series, \"D.A.

Clark reacts angrily, explaining that the show was his and the concept had been taken and produced by someone else. Michael is hurt that Clark would work separately from him, but the pair eventually reconcile their differences and their arrangement returns to normal. Michael takes up driving lessons, and takes an interest in one of his fellow students. The pair try to get Kenny Loggins to perform the theme song for their show, but can't get in touch with him. Michael only barely passes his driving test, and Clark informs him that he won't be driving his car. Regretting this overreaction, he makes it up to Michael with a game of minigolf. A meeting with another potential network ends poorly, unbeknownst to the two, when their arrogant behavior in general makes a bad impression on the executives. Clark soon makes it into Columbia University, and plans to move to New York City to attend. Yet Clark ultimately decides against university when they achieve their TV show dream, with CBS signing them up (as well as in real life).\n\nSeveral guest stars have made appearances in the series:\n\nClark and Michael was distributed by YouTube.\n\n"}
{"id": "50415978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50415978", "title": "Columbia University rape controversy", "text": "Columbia University rape controversy\n\nIn April 2013, Emma Sulkowicz, an American fourth-year visual arts major at Columbia University in New York City, filed a complaint with Columbia University requesting expulsion of fellow fourth-year student and German national, Paul Nungesser, alleging he had raped them in Sulkowicz's dorm room on August 27, 2012. Nungesser was found 'not responsible' by a university inquiry. In 2017, the university issued a statement acknowledging that Nungesser experienced a \"very difficult\" time, promised to keep its gender-based misconduct policies fair, and settled Nungesser's lawsuit under undisclosed terms.\n\nIn May 2014, Sulkowicz filed a report against Nungesser with the New York Police Department (NYPD), who did not pursue charges. The district attorney's office interviewed both students, but did not pursue charges, citing lack of reasonable suspicion. Sulkowicz declined to pursue criminal charges any further, and stated that NYPD officers were dismissive and had mistreated Sulkowicz.\n\nAfter Columbia declined to take action against Nungesser, Sulkowicz focused their senior thesis on a work of performance art entitled \"Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)\" which involved Sulkowicz carrying a 50-pound dorm mattress on campus to represent the painful burden rape victims carry throughout daily life, and in protest of what they described as Columbia University's mishandling of their sexual assault complaint. Nungesser called Sulkowicz's allegations \"untrue and unfounded\" and described the mattress piece as an act of bullying intended to force him to leave Columbia.\n\nIn April 2015, Nungesser filed a Title IX gender discrimination lawsuit against Columbia, its board of trustees, its president Lee Bollinger, and Sulkowicz's supervising art professor Jon Kessler, alleging their negligence in preventing his alleged harassment. Nungesser was represented by Title IX campus due process attorney Andrew Miltenberg.\n\nIn the documents of the complaint, Nungesser stated Sulkowicz's allegation of rape was false, citing as evidence behavior Nungesser said was counterintuitive, such as friendly texts Sulkowicz sent Nungesser days after the alleged attack occurred. The complaint argued Sulkowicz's allegation was made in response to unreciprocated desire for a serious relationship, therefore allowing the performance was harassment and a violation of his student rights. When questioned about the lawsuit, Sulkowicz said that it was \"full of lies.\" Federal District Court Judge Gregory H. Woods dismissed the lawsuit but allowed Nungesser to refile an amended suit, which was settled by Columbia in July 2017.\n\nEmma Sulkowicz (born October 3, 1992 in New York City), attended The Dalton School on the Upper East Side where they were an A student and competitive fencer. In 2011 they began their undergraduate studies at Columbia University as a visual arts major. Sulkowicz identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns.\n\nPaul Jonathan Nungesser (German: Nungeßer; born 1991 in Berlin) is a German citizen who studied architecture at Columbia.\n\nOn April 18, 2013, Sulkowicz reported to Columbia's Office of Gender-Based and Sexual Misconduct that, on the first day of their sophomore year on August 27, 2012, in Sulkowicz's dorm room, they were raped by fellow student Nungesser.\n\nDescribing the alleged rape, Sulkowicz said that what began as a consensual sexual encounter in Sulkowicz's room turned non-consensual. Sulkowicz alleged that Nungesser choked them, slapped their face, held their wrists, and anally raped them, while Sulkowicz struggled and told him to stop. Sulkowicz said that after the alleged assault, Nungesser immediately left the room without speaking.\n\nHe and Sulkowicz both corroborate that they had consensual sex twice before, earlier in the year, but not anal sex. Nungesser said that the encounter in August was also entirely consensual, and he denied the allegations of violence, stating that they briefly had consensual anal sex, followed by other sexual activity, after which they fell asleep, saying he left the room early in the morning while Sulkowicz was still sleeping.\n\nAfterwards they communicated via Facebook messages. Nungesser later described these messages as \"amiable\" and showed transcripts of these messages to Cathy Young, a contributor for \"The Daily Beast\" who has been critical of campus sexual assault activism. Sulkowicz expressed concern that the messages would be used to present them as unreliable, and stated they had sent them because they were upset and wanted to talk to him about the incident but decided against doing so. By the time of Sulkowicz's last message, which they sent in March 2013, they said they had visited the university's Office of Gender-Based Misconduct and that they had asked whether they had tried talking to the accused. A university spokesperson said in February 2015 that its gender-based misconduct policy does not recommend informal resolution or mediation for such complaints.\n\nIn response to criticisms regarding the delay in reporting, Sulkowicz said they initially didn't report the incident to avoid emotional trauma.\n\nThree other complaints have been alleged against Nungesser: a second woman accused him of emotional abuse and nonconsensual sex during a months-long relationship, a third student accused him of non-consensually kissing her and touching her at a party, and a fourth accuser emerged in early 2015, a fourth-year male student who said Nungesser sexually assaulted him after an emotional conversation. The second accuser's investigation was discontinued after she said she was \"exhausted by the barrage of questions\" and stopped responding to emails from the University's Title IX coordinator for sexual assault investigations.\n\nIn early 2013 Sulkowicz discussed the incident with \"Natalie\", Nungesser's former girlfriend. Natalie alleged that there had been non-consensual sex and emotional abuse during her relationship with Nungesser, which lasted from October 2011 to spring 2012. Nungesser denies that charge and describes their time together as a couple as a \"difficult relationship\". Sulkowicz said that the conversation with Natalie prompted them to file a formal complaint to the university. Sulkowicz filed a complaint on April 18, 2013 and Natalie filed one a few days later.\n\nThe third complaint from a student identified as \"Josie\" was initially decided against Nungesser, with an assigned punishment of disciplinary probation, but Nungesser successfully appealed, citing procedural errors and problems with the admission of hearsay. Nungesser further appealed on grounds that his accuser had failed to demonstrate guilt by a \"preponderance of the evidence\" as required in campus hearings. He says the allegations, which were all brought within days of each other, were the result of collusion and are fraudulent. The three women said in interviews with \"The New York Times\" that they decided to file formal complaints with the school after they heard about one another's experiences.\n\nThe fourth student, identified as \"Adam\", said he first reported the incident to the group to which they both belonged, and then he filed a Title IX complaint. Columbia also investigated the complaint and found Nungesser \"not responsible\". According to Cathy Young, the investigators found contradictions in Adam's statements and Facebook dialogs between the men.\n\nOn October 29, the day after Nungesser's third accuser's hearing, one was scheduled for Sulkowicz's case. In November the university found Paul Nungesser \"not responsible\". Sulkowicz's request for an appeal was turned down by the dean.\n\nSulkowicz and Nungesser both complained separately about the proceedings. Sulkowicz complained that Nungesser was granted months of postponements during the hearing, and that they were not allowed to discuss the case with anyone. Sulkowicz said that a university investigator asked inappropriate questions during the interview, and complained that the panel did not consider other allegations against the accused student. A graduate student who acted as Nungesser's official supporter during the hearing defended the panel, disputing that their questions were inappropriate, saying the questions \"were extremely personal because they had to be\".\n\nNungesser complained that he had not been allowed to introduce Facebook messages as evidence. Nungesser and Sulkowicz exchanged several messages in the days and weeks after the alleged rape. In one message, two days after the alleged rape, Sulkowicz accepted an invitation to a party from Nungesser, writing: \"I feel like we need to have some real time where we can talk about life and thingz, because we still haven't really had a paul-emma chill sesh since summmmerrrr.\" Sulkowicz says they sent the messages because they were upset and wanted to talk to Nungesser about the incident.\n\nReporter Katie Zavadski, writing for \"New York Magazine\", opined that amicable exchanges with an alleged attacker didn't disprove that a sexual assault occurred, and Cathy Young acknowledged that victims of sexual violence may cope with trauma in ways that could seem puzzling to outsiders.\n\nThe \"New York Post\" broke the story in December 2013, without naming either party. On April 7, 2014 Sulkowicz appeared with U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) at a press conference about sexual assault on campus, telling reporters that Sulkowicz had been raped.\n\nOn April 24, Sulkowicz and 22 other students (later joined by five others) filed a 100-page federal complaint alleging that Columbia University and Barnard College mishandled their sexual-assault complaints, in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights law to ensure gender equality on campuses. The complaint alleged that the universities were in violation of Title II, a provision against discrimination by a public body on the basis of disability, and the Clery Act, which requires federally financed universities to disclose campus crime statistics.\n\nThe Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights opened two investigations in January 2015 into the Title IX and Title II complaints against Columbia.\n\nOn May 3, 2014 an interview with Sulkowicz appeared on the front page of \"The New York Times\". For several days from May 7 onwards, Paul Nungesser's name was included within lists of \"sexual assault violators\" written on the walls or doors of campus bathrooms, or on flyers. On May 14, Sulkowicz filed a report with the NYPD. Columbia's student newspaper, the \"Columbia Daily Spectator\", controversially published the accused student's name two days later. The editors stated that they felt it would be \"irresponsible to keep his name hidden\", noting that Nungesser had been at the center of three sexual assault complaints as well as a number of fliers posted around campus. Nungesser said he agreed to a police interview at the Sex Crimes Unit in New York City in August, and that shortly after this the district attorney's office told him they would not be pursuing the case. Sulkowicz declined to pursue an investigation after they discovered the case could extend past graduation, when they would probably want to \"erase all of [their] memories of Columbia\". Sulkowicz further stated that NYPD officers were dismissive and \"badly mistreated\" Sulkowicz.\n\nSulkowicz created \"Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)\" in the summer of 2014 for their senior thesis while at Yale University Summer School of Art and Music. Their first effort was a video of themself dismantling a bed, accompanied by the audio of them filing the police report, which they had recorded on their cellphone. The mattress later became the sole focus of the piece. Sulkowicz told \"New York\" magazine:\n\nThe , dark-blue, extra-long twin mattress used in the performance art piece is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, similar to the one on which they allege they were raped. Sulkowicz spent the summer of 2014 creating the rules of engagement: Written on the walls of their studio in the university's Watson Hall, these state that they must carry the mattress whenever they are on university property; that it must remain on campus even when Sulkowicz is not there; and that they are not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but if help is offered they may accept it. In September that year they began carrying it on campus, which they say is a physically painful experience. Sulkowicz later created another piece of performance art, Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol (\"This is not a rape\"), a website with an eight minute video of Sulkowicz having sex with an anonymous actor in a dorm room at Columbia University.\n\nOn April 23, 2015, Nungesser filed a sexual discrimination lawsuit against Columbia, its board of trustees, its president Lee Bollinger, and Sulkowicz's supervising art professor Jon Kessler. The suit alleged that the performance was bullying and constituted gender-based harassment, and argued that Columbia's offering course credit for the work violated his rights under Title IX. The suit sought damages for the harm Nungesser said he experienced to his reputation as a result of the performance.\n\nThe suit argues that Nungesser had provided evidence that the encounter was consensual with lack of signs of physical or emotional trauma and text based messages where Sulkowicz responded to Nungesser positively after the encounter. The suit also faults Columbia University for awarding course credits for a project that accused him of rape. The suit alleged gender based discrimination, arguing that Nungesser was \"targeted because he is a male, and attacked for his (consensual) sexual activity.\" Nungesser's suit also alleged that the publicity surrounding the case had harmed his job prospects.\n\nThe case was assigned to US District Court Judge Gregory Woods. Woods dismissed the case in March 2016, but allowed Nungesser another attempt. Nungesser issued an amended complaint in April 2016. The amended complaint argued that Columbia University's sexual assault policies promoted a stereotype of the \"sex-driven male\", and constituted gender based discrimination in violation of Title IX. On March 24, 2017 Woods dismissed Nungesser's re-filed complaint, ruling that Nungesser had failed to state an actionable claim against Columbia University. After having the lawsuit dismissed twice, Nungesser had prepared an appeal, but he eventually agreed to settle with the university in July 2017. The terms of the settlement were confidential.\n\nRobby Soave, an editor for \"Reason.com\", commented that Nungesser was \"flipping the script\" by basing his suit on Title IX, because \"many alleged victims of rape who believe that they were deprived of justice have turned to Title IX when they assert that their universities are failing to honor federal requirements.\"\n\nSome commentators expressed skepticism that Nungesser's claim would succeed in court. Megan McArdle commented on the Title IX complaint in \"Bloomberg View\" saying, \"I don't find (Nungesser's) litany of complaints particularly compelling\", and stated that they believed the gender discrimination claim was unlikely to succeed. McArdle concluded by suggesting that Nungesser may not have intended to win the suit or to silence Sulkowicz, but instead to \"force the media to pay a little attention to his side of the story, something that didn't happen during the many long months of Sulkowicz's campaign to name and shame him.\" Slate columnist Nora Caplan-Bricker questioned whether the suit could succeed, noting that courts have previously dismissed similar suits in which men accused of sexual assault claimed that they were victims of gender discrimination.\n\nCathy Young, commenting on the dismissal of Nungesser's suit in the \"New York Post\", conceded that \"Nungesser's case is more of an uphill battle than most\", but nevertheless argued that she hoped \"the lawsuit goes forward — not only on Nungesser’s behalf, but for the sake of truth-seeking about a tangled case that raises important issues.\"\n\nAmanda Marcotte, in a column for the news site Talking Points Memo, criticized Nungesser's decision to pursue a claim under Title IX rather than file a libel suit, and characterized the suit as a \"nuisance lawsuit\" This characterization was disputed by Samantha Harris of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, who instead argued that the suit demonstrated the problem with requiring universities to investigate accusations of sexual assault, cautioning that \"until something changes, we are likely to see more cases like this one.\"\n\nSulkowicz responded to the lawsuit by saying it is \"ridiculous that Paul would sue not only the school but one of my past professors for allowing me to make an art piece\" and saying that Nungesser has made \"continued public attempts to smear my reputation\".\n\nThe school, via one of its spokespeople, had no official comment on the lawsuit, and Kessler also declined to comment, although Columbia University president Bollinger offered a general statement: \"The law and principles of academic freedom allow students to express themselves on issues of public debate; at the same time, our legal and ethical responsibility is to be fair and impartial in protecting the rights and accommodating the concerns of all students in these matters.\"\n\nOn July 14, 2017, Columbia and Nungesser agreed to settle the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount. The university said in a statement: “Columbia recognizes that after the conclusion of the investigation, Paul’s remaining time at Columbia became very difficult for him and not what Columbia would want any of its students to experience. Columbia will continue to review and update its policies toward ensuring that every student — accuser and accused, including those like Paul who are found not responsible — is treated respectfully and as a full member of the Columbia community.”\n\nPublic opinion regarding the case and lawsuit has been mixed.\n\nCathy Young, who has written other \"stories critical of campus anti-rape activism,\" criticized Columbia University for violating the defendant's rights to due process, commenting there was \"certainly enough evidence to grant Nungesser the benefit of reasonable doubt not only in legal disciplinary proceedings, but in the court of public opinion\". KC Johnson, history professor at Brooklyn College argued that Sulkowicz's performance violated Columbia University's policy instructing participants in campus hearings to “make all reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality/privacy of the involved parties\". After Sulkowicz accused Cathy Young and Paul Nungesser of invading their privacy while reporting on the accusation, \"National Review\" columnist Ian Tuttle wrote Sulkowicz wanted \"to make claims about another person that cannot be challenged, checked, questioned, or doubted.\" Columnist and political analyst Mona Charen was critical of Sulkowicz, and said that \"it seem[ed] highly likely that Sulkowicz is shading the truth\". Janet Halley, a professor at Harvard Law School, commented that Columbia University's promise to review its policies was \"a confession\" that it thinks it made a mistake in how it dealt with the case.\n\nErin Gloria Ryan of Jezebel supported Sulkowicz, criticizing Young and accusing her of invoking a \"perfect victim\" narrative that relied on inaccurate stereotypes about how sexual assault victims should behave. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand invited Sulkowicz to a State of the Union address in an effort to \"further amplify\" their voice, saying that activists like them \"shine a light on the scourge of sexual assault\" on college campuses. When the lawsuit was settled, Dana Bolger, co-founder of Know Your IX, expressed concern, saying she hoped universities wouldn't take the result \"as a sign that they should be cracking down on student activism\".\n"}

{"id": "13754651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13754651", "title": "Fighter kite", "text": "Fighter kite\n\nFighter kites are kites used for the sport of kite fighting. Traditionally most are small, unstable single-line flat kites where line tension alone is used for control, and an abrasive line is used to cut down the string/line of other kites.\n\nKite fighting is done in many countries, but is particularly associated with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Vietnam, Korea, Thailand, and Brazil.\n\nIn most traditional fighter kite manufacture, the skins of kites are made from a lightweight thin paper and the spars are usually made from a lightweight and flexible wood, usually bamboo.\n\nIn modern American fighters, the kite skins are made from a variety of synthetic materials – mylar, aircraft insulation (orcon or insulfab), nylon, and polyester sheeting. The spine may still be bamboo, but often along with the bow is constructed of fiberglass or carbon fibre.\n\nHistorically, for most Asian type fighters, a thin cotton or hemp line is coated with a mixture of finely crushed glass and rice glue. In recent years, synthetic line has been coated with a variety of abrasives and stronger glue. Also, there have been some reports of metallic line being used. Some cultures use line that has metal knives attached to hook and cut the opponent's line.\n\nTraditionally, players use a paste of some sort to toughen their line. The primary components of this include glue and crushed glass, but depending on personal preference other materials are added to improve the properties of the line.\n\nIn line touch competition, synthetic braided fishing line, 15 to 20 lb test, is used due to its low stretch and high strength for the line diameter and weight. Waxed cotton, linen line or Latex can also be used.\n\n\nBridle position, spine curve, centre of gravity, and balance of tension on the spars all play a role in how the kite spins and tracks. Afghan and Indian fighter kites and their variants have their bridles attached in two places on the kite's spine. The first place is at the crossing of the bow and the spine. The second attachment is three-quarters to two-thirds of the total length of the spine from the nose of the kite. The length of the top line to the tow point is the length between the two bridle to spine connection points. The length of the bottom bridle to the tow point is between half an inch to two inches (1.2–5 cm) longer than the length of the two spine connections. The spine of the kite has a slight convex curve toward the face of the kite. To make the kite spin more, the upper bridle line is shortened: to make the kite spin less, the lower bridle line is shortened . Left and right tracking are adjusted by either placing weight on the tip of a wing, or by weakening the bow on the side that you want the kite to track towards. The design of the kite plays a role in the tendency for the kite to spin and pull, and how much wind the kite can handle. Bridling and tuning are only effective when the kite chosen is able to handle the amount of wind that it is being flown in. If the wind is so strong that the spine and bow are severely distorted, no amount of bridle tuning will help with making the kite controllable. A crude method of making a kite flyable in over-strong wind, used in India where the kites are cheap and regarded as disposable, is to burn small holes in the flying surface, typically using a cigarette.\n\nWhen the kite is flown with the line taut, the kite is deformed by the wind pressure, giving it a degree of stability. When the line tension is reduced, either by letting out more line or by the flyer moving into wind, the kite will begin to become unstable and begin to rock from side to side, or in extreme cases even spin. By reapplying tension at the right moment, the kite will move in the direction that the flyer requires.\n\nAlthough a spool that allows rapid winding and release of line is used, often the flyer will fly the kite by holding the line instead of the spool, with one or more assistants to help manage the slack line between the flyer and the spool.\n\nMany of these kites are flown with an abrasive coated line (manja). Most kites are flown with a set length of manja at the kite end. The manja is very sharp and to avoid getting hand injuries most competitors use ordinary string (saddi) for their hand position. Some cutting involves knives of some sort attached to the tail, line, or kite. Competition rules vary by geographical area. Two or more contestants fly their kites. The person who cuts the opponents line wins the fight. In multiple kite matches, the person with the last kite in the air is the winner.\n\nThe two most common types of cutting are done with abrasive coated line – release cutting or pull cutting. To release cut, once the lines are in contact, both parties start to play out line until one line is cut. In pull cutting, the flier quickly retrieves line until the opponents line is cut. There are many factors in who will win the event and include the size of the kite, the quality of the kite, the quality of the line, the quality of the abrasive on the line, the quality and size of the spool, the spool handler, initial contact, the skill of the person flying the kite, and the wind conditions.\n\nTwo or more kites are flown. Competitors try to capture their opponents kite and bring it to the ground. The person or team who succeeds is the winner.\n\nExpert kite fighters are able to cut their opponents line (manjha) and then encircle the trailing line (lubjow) of the cut kite. Once secured, the winner can then fly both kites and pull in the prize. Those not involved in the kite flying can be \"kite runners\" (Once a kite is cut, it no longer belongs to anyone until caught and claimed by the kite runner.). Many children die every year when they run into the path of vehicles or fall off roofs or, occasionally, with the fibre glass string cutting the flier's fingers or neck. The glass on the string is said to give the kite \"cutting teeth\".\n\nThe various countries where fighter kites are flown all have their own specific styles of kites, rules for fighting and traditions. In many cases there is a \"season\" or a special occasion particularly associated with kite flying.\n\nKites used range from 0.5-meter to 1.5 meters across. The usual name for the sport is \"gudiparan bazi\" and for the cutting line \"tar\". As elsewhere, the line is traditionally made with a cotton line and coated with a mixture of crushed glass and rice glue. However, nylon string with stronger glue is now often the preferred line. Kites can go up to 3,500 meters in height depending on the size of the kite.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2001, the Taliban government in Afghanistan outlawed kite fighting, and kite flying, by declaring it \"un-Islamic\". After the fall of the Taliban government kite fighting has returned to the country.\n\nAs part of the Shakrain festival, people mostly from south Dhaka city engage in kite fighting. They fly kites mostly from the rooftops. The festival is held in the last day of the \"Poush\" month.\n\nIn Brazil, kite fighting is a very popular leisure activity for children, teenagers and even young adults, particularly boys and men. As in other countries with similar traditions, injuries are common and motorcyclists in particular need to take precautions. The traditional kite (or \"pipa\"), has pentagonal shape, but simple diamonds similar to fighter kites elsewhere are also very common.\n\nMost Caribbean kites are hexagonal, flown with a tail, and instead of cutting with glass-coated line, use sharp objects (generally razor blades) attached to the tails to try to \"koule\" (Creole for \"drop\") other kites.\n\nVariations of this style exist throughout the Caribbean – in Haiti, Cuba, Trinidad and Tobago, Curaçao and Surinam.\n\nFighter kites are known as \"volantín\". They are square shaped, and made with light paper and bamboo sticks. Unlike other square fighter kites of the world, the Chilean \"volantín\" uses 3 support threads (two at the top and one at the bottom) for easier, more stable manoeuvre. Whilst used widely for decorative purposes, the tail of the Chilean \"volantín\" is not used during competitive matches. The Chilean \"volantín\" can also vary in size, ranging from \"ñecla\" as the smallest size available, to \"pavo\" as the largest. However, in the context of kite fighting \"medio pavo\" or medium-sized kites are the most popular choice due to their more balanced performance in terms of speed, strength, and accuracy.\nPractitioners of this activity usually begin fighting in September, when the spring winds are arriving to the Chilean coast. Clubs and professional associations, however, prefer to host tournaments throughout the drier summer months when the commercial kite season is over.\n\nChilean kite fighting practice include the use of a large reel, (\"carrete\"), for the manipulation and storage of the abrasive thread, and the use of wooden sticks for the manipulation of the \"carrete\" in turn. Therefore, it is possible for a skilled kite fighter to complete a match without ever touching the thread with their hands if their mastery of \"carrete\" usage is advanced enough. Since the mid 2000s, the use of \"carrete\" has become widespread in Latin America and Europe. Its convenience, durability and safety make it one of the most popular exports of the Chilean kite fighting culture.\nFighter kites are known as \"patang\" in India. In many others, kite flying takes place mainly during specific festivals particularly the spring festival known as Basant, during Makar Sankranti and more recently on Indian Independence Day.\n\nThe Nagasaki Hata is similar to the Indian Patang, and it believed to have been introduced into Japan, from Indonesia, by Dutch traders. It is highly manoeuvrable and fought with glass coated line in line cutting contests in a similar way to kite fighting in many other countries.\n\nAnother type of kite fighting in Japan uses very large kites requiring teams. In these contests cutting line is not used, but instead kites are forced down. The festivals occur at Shirone and Hamamatsu.\n\nThe Rokkaku is 1-2m high hexagonal kite fought with teams of players flying each kite. Both the Rokkaku and the smaller rectangular Buka have been adopted and further developed by western kite enthusiasts.\n\nThe Korean fighter kite, the bang-pae yeon is a rectangular, bowed \"shield\" kite with a hole in the middle of the sail. The frame uses five bamboo spars—one each across the top and the \"waist\" of the kite, a \"spine,\" and two diagonals.\n\nAlthough cutting line and fights are similar to other Asian fighter kites, a large spool is always used.\n\nKite fighting in Nepal is especially active during the festival of Dashain. The skies are filled with colourful kites called \"changas\", made from Nepali \"lokta\" paper. The line used is coated in crushed glass to cut through the lines of rival kites. When a rival line has been cut, the victorious team shouts \"chet\" to claim their win over the other team.\n\nKite fighting is common in all over Pakistan, but mainly concentrated in cities of Punjab and Sindh region including Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Karachi, Islamabad etc. While city of Lahore is considered as the capital of kite battling in South Asia. Kite flying is considered as the culture of Lahore. In the past, kite battling had a status of sports in Lahore, and those kite flyers were termed as \"Khilari\" or sportsman.\n\nThe kites that are manufactured for battling are very different from the conventional kites as they are especially designed and made for this purpose. Each of these kites has some special abilities for battling which make them unique from each other. According to history, Akbar the Mughal Emperor, who lived in his residence in Lahore from 1584 to 1598, enclosed the city with brick walls and 12 gates of considerable height and strength. One of the gates, called the \"Moochi Darwaza\" or \"Cobbler Gateway,\" is the most popular site in Lahore to buy and sell Kite flying and firework materials. Kup, Patang, Guda, Nakhlaoo, Pan, Tukal, Muchal, Farfarata, etc. are some of the kites used in the battle, and they vary in balance, weight and speed through the air.\n\nKite flying is currently banned in some regions of Pakistan as some kite fliers engage in kite battles by coating their strings with glass or shards of metal, leading to injuries and death.\n\nThreads for kite battling are manufactured using special glues, chemicals and crushed glass and are numbered based on their ability to cut other threads and to handle kite's weight. It is a social event in Pakistan that happens once a year.\n\nCity of Lahore is famous for its Bassant or Spring Festival throughout South Asian communities. People from all over Pakistan and few from neighbouring India come to Lahore to annually celebrate the two days long Bassant or Spring Festival. This festival is mostly held on last weekend of February or March. Festival is started on the night of Saturday, people battle White coloured kites, organise parties and arrange loud music on their rooftops throughout the night till morning. Whitepaper kite shimmer in the night sky diving soaring as rival flyers joust duels marked with the battle cries of \"paich\" (When kite flyers entangle the manja of their flying kites with each other and try to cut the string of the other by the pull or release method) and victory cries of \"wo kaataa\". Every success is celebrated with Bhangra Dance and beating of traditional drum.\n\nMainly centred in Lahore and Faisalabad, people spend thousands of Rupees in preparing different types of kites and threads best suited to battle. Homes are also decorated with lights and decorations for evening festivities for the next day.\n\nThe Korean shield kite (pangp'aeyon), the Japanese Rokkaku and Nagasaki Hata, the Brazilian Piao, the Chilean fighter kites have been used for demonstration purposes at various large kite festivals throughout the country.\n\nFighter kite competitors in the United States use a variety of innovative kites from a wide range of designs and materials for \"line touch\" and skills competitions. Fighter or \"single line maneuverable\" kites can be found flying throughout the country at many kite festivals. A championship competition occurs at the annual convention of the American Kitefliers Association. http://kite.org/activities/events/aka-convention/\n\nIn India, Pakistan, Brazil and Chile, there have been reported accidents involving the abrasive coated cutting line. These accidents range in severity from small cuts on the fighter's fingers to a few reported deaths from contact with the line while riding motorcycles. In recent years, the fighting lines have evolved from the traditional cotton, rice and glass line to nylon or synthetic line coated with metallic or chemical abrasive compounds. To prevent further injury, many countries have implemented restrictions or bans on the use of cutting line. Some have set limits on the materials used to make the line, others have mandated safety devices on motorcycles when riding during kite festivals. People have been injured while fixated on capturing a cut kite. Other injuries have been due to not paying attention to one's actions while watching battles. Most of these accidents are preventable when fighting is strictly controlled to a specific arena and proper safety gear is worn by the fighters. Other accidents have occurred due to the masses of people present during large kite festivals for which kite fighting has taken the blame.\n\nThe kite strings left around after the fight can become stuck in tall trees and can stay there for long periods, impacting the natural aesthetic of parks and wilderness areas, thus degrading the experience of other park users from the trash that is left about.\n\nStray animals have also been known to get trapped and injured on kite lines that have fallen closer to the ground.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7688771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7688771", "title": "Hare Ribbin'", "text": "Hare Ribbin'\n\nHare Ribbin' is a 1944 animated short film in the \"Merrie Melodies\" series, directed by Robert Clampett and featuring Bugs Bunny. The plot features Bugs' conflict with a red-haired hound dog, whom the rabbit sets out to evade and make a fool of using one-liners, reverse psychology, disguises and other tricks. It was released in theaters by Warner Bros. Pictures on June 24, 1944. The title is a pun on \"hair ribbon\".\n\nIt is also the first Warner Bros. cartoon to include Bugs' head in the open title sequence.\n\nThe short opens with a dog with a Russian accent (a la Bert Gordon's \"Mad Russian\") hunting for a rabbit by sniffing a trail. He happens upon Bugs who begins to torment the dog. This prompts a chase, which leads to a nearby lake where the rest of the story continues. Most of the action takes place underwater.\n\nEventually, after a few gags, with Bugs dressed up as a mermaid, playing tag with the dog and throwing the dog into a rock, leaving his feet sticking out and Bugs disguising himself as Elmer Fudd, the dog corners Bugs and demands he gives him a rabbit sandwich. Bugs obliges, and the rabbit places himself between two giant slices of loaf bread with his legs curled next to his body. The dog takes a bite and Bugs screams and fakes his death. The dog becomes instantly grief-stricken and sobs, declaring that he should be the one to die. With this statement, Bugs springs back to life asking, \"Ehhhh...do you mean it?\", and obliges the dog's death wish (see Censorship and alternative endings below). The dog falls to the ground, Bugs plants a flower on his chest and dances away into the distance. As the cartoon is about to \"iris out\" the dog sits up (revealing that he is still alive), holds the iris before it closes, and declares \"\"This\" shouldn't even happen to a dog!\". He then lets the iris go, but it closes on his nose in the process, making him yelp in pain.\n\n\nMichael S. Shull and David E. Wilt consider it ambiguous if this cartoon contain a World War II-related reference. While underwater, Bugs disguises himself as a mermaid. The dog transforms into a torpedo to pursue \"her\".\n\nThe two alternate versions of the ending were based on the perception of someone that Bugs could not be seen killing another animal. This someone was perhaps a studio administrator.\n\nThe opening gag of this cartoon in which the dog sniffs around Bugs' armpits and then exclaims \"B.O!\" (body odor) in a voice similar to that of a foghorn is a parody of a then popular radio ad for Life Buoy Soap.\n\nCuriously, part of the speech from one of the Japanese soldiers from the episode \"Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips\" is also heard in the background, when Bugs faked being a waiter asking for a rabbit sandwich.\n\n This cartoon short holds the distinction of having two endings, both of which are too violent by today's standards to be shown on children/family-friendly television. In both endings, the Russian Dog, distraught over Bugs' \"death\" and guilt-ridden, wishes he were dead too. Bugs then quotes the Mad Russian, saying, \"eh, do you mean it?\" After that scene comes one of two different scenarios:\n\nThe original theatrical ending: Bugs gives the dog a gun so he can commit suicide by shooting himself in the head—once played in theaters to a general audience, is now commonly cut from television versions on network and cable TV, although it has aired uncensored (as recently as 2015) on the Canadian cable channel Teletoon Retro. This ending was also aired uncensored on an episode of Cartoon Network's \"The Bob Clampett Show\", as well as the Cartoon Network's New Year's Day Looney Tunes marathons in 2009 and 2010. The edit occurs between the scene where Bugs says \"Do you mean it?\" and the dog laying down, making it seem as if the dog had dropped dead out of guilt without shooting himself.\n\nThe \"director's cut\" ending: Bugs pulls out a gun, shooting the dog through the mouth. Bugs then dances away, and the dog gets up to deliver the last line: \"This shouldn't happen to a dog.\" was never shown in theaters or on television, despite that the episode of Cartoon Network's \"The Bob Clampett Show\" that aired \"Hare Ribbin'\" with its general release ending mentioned that \"Hare Ribbin'\" had an alternate ending (this one) that was never shown, and due to its violence, never will be. The director's cut version was first discovered on the fifth volume of the laserdisc set of \"The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 5\" and the entire cartoon with the director's cut part is now on the fifth volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD set as a special feature.\n\nOther scenes included in the director's cut is an extended scene of the Dog sniffing for Bugs in the beginning of the film. Also when the dog turns around and sees Bugs in his mermaid costume, in the original cut the Dog turns into a torpedo right when Bugs whistles at him. The director's cut adds a scene where the dog starts heavy breathing before turning into a torpedo, with an extended version of them playing tag.\n\nOne scene that is not used in the director's cut is when we see Bugs move his body up in the bread so he's not actually eaten by the dog. Based on the slight difference in animation style from the rest of the film, both this and the scene when Bugs hands him the gun appear to be re-shoots, added before the theatrical release.\n\n\"The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 5\" laserdisc set has the \"director's cut\" version of this cartoon, unrestored.\nThe of the \"Looney Tunes Golden Collection\" DVD set has the original cut of \"Hare Ribbin\"', restored and remastered, and the director's cut as a special feature, unrestored and unremastered (you can tell the difference between both cuts by the tinting of the color).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4002834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4002834", "title": "Hellraiser (franchise)", "text": "Hellraiser (franchise)\n\nHellraiser is a horror franchise that consists of ten films, a series of books, various comic books, and additional merchandise and media. The franchise is based on the novella \"The Hellbound Heart\" by English author Clive Barker, who would go on to write and direct the adaptation of his story, titled \"Hellraiser\". The films, as well as the comic book series, continually feature the Cenobite Pinhead.\n\nThe series’ storyline focuses on a puzzle box that opens a gateway to the Hell-like realm of the Cenobites, an order of formerly human monsters who harvest human souls to torture in sadomasochistic experiments. Although Clive Barker wrote the original story, and also wrote and directed the first film, he has not written or directed any of the succeeding sequels. Barker stated that he signed away the story and character rights to the production company before the first film, not realizing what a great success it would be.\n\nIn the original \"Hellraiser\" (1987), Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) escapes from the Cenobites when his brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) spills his own blood on the spot where Frank died opening a puzzle box that opened a gateway to the Cenobites. With the help of Larry's wife Julia (Clare Higgins), Frank begins regenerating his body with the blood of victims that Julia supplies him. Larry's daughter, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), accidentally unleashes the Cenobites, but makes a deal to deliver Frank to them in exchange for her own life. After taking Frank, the Cenobites go back on their deal and try and take Kirsty as well. Solving the puzzle box, Kirsty sends the Cenobites back to Hell. \n\nIn 1988, a sequel titled \"\" follows Dr. Philip Channard (Kenneth Cranham) as he resurrects Julia, who was stuck in Hell with the Cenobites. Kirsty is pulled back into the Cenobite world, where the demons decide to keep her, but, having discovered the human identity of the Cenobites early, Kirsty appeals to their latent humanity, specifically the Cenobite leader Pinhead (Doug Bradley). Pinhead decides to release her, but he and his followers are killed by Channard, who has become a Cenobite himself. With help of a teenage girl, Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), who unknowingly assisted Channard in opening the box, Kirsty and Tiffany escape the Cenobite world and close the gateway behind them.\n\nIn \"\" (1992), the revelation of Pinhead's humanity has resulted in a schism, splitting him in two—his human self, World War I veteran Elliot Spencer, and Pinhead, now a living embodiment of Spencer's id. While Spencer is trapped in limbo, Pinhead is trapped, along with the puzzle box, in the surface of an intricately carved pillar, a relic of the Cenobite realm. The pillar is found by a night club owner, J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt), who begins assisting Pinhead in his resurrection. A television reporter, Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell), begins to learn about Pinhead and the puzzle box, which leads her to Monroe's night club. Pinhead is eventually resurrected, and begins creating new Cenobite followers in an effort to establish Hell on Earth. Joey manages to reunite Spencer and Pinhead, fusing them back into one entity, and is able to use the puzzle box to send Pinhead back to his dimension. Afterward, Joey submerges the box into freshly laid cement at a construction site. \n\n\"\" (1996) tells the story of the creator of the puzzle box, referred to as the Lament Configuration. A toymaker named Philip Lemarchand (Bruce Ramsay) is commissioned by the Duc de L'Isle (Mickey Cottrell), a wealthy Aristocrat and master of the dark arts, to create the box as a gateway to Hell so that de L'Isle can enslave a demon. Beginning in the distant future, and tracing the history of the box from its creation in 1784, \"Bloodline\" shows how the Lemarchand family attempts to close the box forever after learning what L'Isle uses it for. Eventually, Dr. Paul Merchant creates the Elysium Configuration, a space station capable of closing the gateway for good, and he traps Pinhead inside and destroys him and the box.\n\n\"\" (2000), the first of the succeeding sequels to be direct-to-video, follows corrupt police Detective Joseph Thorne (Craig Sheffer) as he discovers the puzzle box while investigating a series of ritualistic murders. As time goes on he begins to uncover clues that suggest that he is the killer. Eventually, Pinhead appears and informs Thorne that the events of the movie have been transpiring in Thorne's own personal Hell, and that he will be reliving the same series of events for eternity. \n\nIn \"\" (2002), Ashley Laurence returns to play Kirsty Cotton. In the opening moments, she and her husband, Trevor (Dean Winters), end up in a car accident that kills Kirsty. One month later, Trevor wakes up in a hospital, but because of a head injury, his memory is uncertain and he cannot distinguish between fantasy and reality. As he begins to uncover evidence that he was having a series of affairs, he also comes under suspicion for orchestrating the crash that killed his wife. Pinhead appears in the end, and informs Trevor that he was the one that died in the car crash, his own plot to murder Kirsty for her inheritance backfired when Kirsty offered the Cenobites the lives of Trevor, his mistresses and his co-conspirators in exchange for her own.\n\nIn \"\" (2005), reporter Amy Klein (Kari Wuhrer) is sent to Bucharest to investigate an underground suicide cult founded by a descendant of Philip Lemarchand, who claims to be able to bring back the dead and who believes that it is his birthright to open the puzzle box and control the Cenobites. She is gradually drawn into their world and eventually sees no way out other than to join them. In the end she opens the puzzle box, summoning up Pinhead and the Cenobites, who kill everyone for attempting to invade their world. To prevent Pinhead from taking her soul, Amy kills herself. \n\n\"\" (2005) is set in the \"real world,\" in which \"Hellraiser\" has spawned a successful MMORPG. Five friends mourning the death of one of their fellow players—who committed suicide after becoming obsessed with the game—receive in-game invitations to a party at the Leviathan House. At the house, the host of the party (Lance Henriksen) takes them on a tour of the many layers of the home, after which they are picked off one-by-one by the host or Pinhead. The final two victims ultimately realize that most of the events of the movie have been a hallucination, after the host—the father of their deceased friend, who blames his son's fellow players for not breaking his addiction to the game—drugged them and buried them alive. The police rescue the surviving teenagers, Chelsea (Katheryn Winnick) and Jake (Christopher Jacot), while the host escapes to a decrepit motel with a suitcase of his son's belongings. The host discovers a real puzzle box inside, and upon opening it is killed by Pinhead and a pair of Cenobites.\n\nIn 2011, a ninth film was released to a single theater in California for a crew showing that was ostensibly open to the public. \"\" is the first film not to feature Doug Bradley as Pinhead and was shot in two weeks for $300,000. It was suggested by Bloody Disgusting that the film was only shot so that The Weinstein Company would not lose its filming rights before it could produce a remake of the original. The film was released on DVD on 18 October 2011. \n\nA tenth film, \"\", began filming in early 2016. Like \"Revelations\", it does not feature Doug Bradley as Pinhead, as he turned the role down due to the production company's refusal to allow him to read the film's script unless he signed a non-disclosure agreement regarding its contents. This film was released on DVD in February 2018.\n\n\nIn October 2006, Barker announced through his official website that he would be writing the script to a forthcoming remake of the original \"Hellraiser\" film, to be produced by Dimension Films. French director Pascal Laugier was set to direct the film but was later taken off the project due to creative differences with the producers; Laugier wanted his film to be a very serious take whereas the producers wanted the film to be more commercial and appeal to a teen audience. \n\nOn January 28, 2010, Camelot Entertainment Group, Inc. announced that the distributor was working on \"Unearthed: The Hellraiser Saga\", a documentary on the franchise. It will be directed by Stefan Hutchinson and written by Ryan Rotten.\n\nOn 20 October 2010, it was officially announced that Patrick Lussier and Todd Farmer were to direct and write, respectively, a reboot of the \"Hellraiser\" franchise. The film's story would differ from the original film, as Lussier and Farmer did not want to retell the original story out of respect for Clive Barker's work. The film was to instead focus on the world and function of the puzzle box. However, in 2011, Farmer confirmed that both he and Lussier were dropped from the project. \n\nIn October 2013, Clive Barker announced that he would be directing and writing the film; Doug Bradley was to return in his role as Pinhead. In October 2014, Barker stated that a second draft of the script was completed and described the film as a \"very loose\" remake of the original film, but stated that he may not direct the film. On 18 March 2017, Clive Barker said that the film's \"script was written and delivered to Dimension years ago. That was the last anyone heard until news of a sequel surfaced.\"\n\nIn other media, A \"Hellraiser\" television series was developed by Sonar Entertainment in 2012, intended to include some key players from the films.\n\nAn anthology book consisting of twenty-one stories and entitled \"Hellbound Hearts\" was released on 29 September 2009. \"The Scarlet Gospels\" - a sequel to \"The Hellbound Heart\" and crossover with Clive Barker's Harry D'Amour stories - was written by Barker and released in 2015. \"Hellraiser: The Toll\", set before \"The Scarlet Gospels\" and after \"The Hellbound Heart\", was written by Mark Alan Miller and published by Subterranean Press in February 2018. In 2016, Paul Kane authored \"Sherlock Holmes and the Servants of Hell\" which brings together the world of \"Hellraiser\" with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.\n\nImmediately following the success of the 1987 movie Hellraiser several comics series began to be released.\n\nEpic Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics, began publishing series of comic book spin-offs for the \"Hellraiser\" franchise. The comics contained a set of short stories, with Clive Barker acting as a consultant on all of the comics. Between 1989 and 1992, Epic published twenty regular series comics. They also published three special issues from 1992 to 1994, one being a holiday special, in addition to an adaptation of \"Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth\" and a collection of the first two issues. Other releases included the limited series Clive Barker's \"Book of the Damned\" and \"Pinhead\", as well as the crossovers \"Hellraiser vs. Nightbreed: Jihad\" and \"Pinhead vs. Marshal Law: Law in Hell\". The following series were released by Epic Comics:\n\nIn December, 2010, Boom! Studios announced they would be publishing a new \"Hellraiser\" series, written by Clive Barker and Christopher Monfette, beginning March 2011, and would also be reprinting select Epic Comics under the title \"Hellraiser: Masterworks\". The following series were released by Boom! Studios:\n\nSeraphim Incorporated, a graphic novel imprint headed by Clive Barker, began publishing a series of original graphic novels titled \"Hellraiser: Anthology\" in 2017. They are collections of stories taking place within the \"Hellraiser\" universe hailing from various creators, including Barker himself.\n\nThere have been two non-fiction books released that chronicle the \"Hellraiser\" films. The first, released on 21 May 2004, was published by Titan Books and titled \"The Hellraiser Chronicles\". Written by Peter Atkins and Stephen Jones, with a foreword by Clive Barker, \"The Hellraiser Chronicles\" is a collection of production photographs, design sketches, excerpts from the scripts, and interviews with the cast and crew. The next book, \"The Hellraiser Films And Their Legacy\", was released by McFarland & Company on 27 November 2006; it was written by Paul Kane, and features foreword by Pinhead actor Doug Bradley. \"Hellraiser Films\" collects the production history of all eight films, their spin-offs, as well as how the series relates to popular culture. The book provides an in-depth look at the film characters, and interpretations of the choices those characters make in the film. \"Hellraiser Films\" also provides a brief look at the fan short film \"No More Souls\".\n\nA feature-length documentary, \"\", was originally due for release in 2015, and comprises interviews with the cast and crew. It is being directed by K. John McDonagh and produced by Cult Film Screenings, based in Birmingham, who used Kickstarter to raise the funds necessary to conduct further interviews in the United States, although Clive Barker pulled out at the last minute due to ill health.\n\n\"Super 3D Noah's Ark\" began as a \"Hellraiser\" license for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The team eventually abandoned the \"Hellraiser\" license and converted it into a simplistic Bible-based game. Prior to the release of \"Bloodline\", Magnet Interactive Studios developed an unrelated video game called \"Hellraiser: Virtual Hell\". Bradley acted in the game during filming of \"Bloodline\". Miriam Van Scott, writing in the \"Encyclopedia of Hell\", called it \"a slick adventure\" that \"truly involves the player\". In 2011, The Weinstein Company announced video games based on several of their franchises, including \"Hellraiser\".\n\nKatie Rife of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote that the \"Hellraiser\" films intentionally alienate casual viewers and instead appeal to the type of fan she compares to a \"humorless art student\" who prefers dark poetry to the more fraternity-oriented slasher films. Continuing the metaphor, Rife wrote, \"Even when its ambition exceeds its budget—which is often—it's trying to say something with its occult art projects.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "25162448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25162448", "title": "History of baseball in Nicaragua", "text": "History of baseball in Nicaragua\n\nBaseball is the national game of Nicaragua, and is one of the most popular sports in the country. Nicaragua has a professional baseball league, the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League, consisting of four teams. The national baseball team has been successful in the past, mainly throughout the 1970s. In many pick-up games, players have to improvise due to lack of equipment. Often, grapefruits, and rocks are used as baseballs. Nicaragua and near-by Panama are two countries who have baseball as their national sport, rather than soccer, the national sport of many Central American countries.\n\nBaseball was introduced in the 1880s by Albert Addlesberg, an American businessman living in Bluefields. During this time, the area around Bluefields was known as the autonomous Mosquito Reserve and a strong British influence in the area was evidenced by the popularity of cricket. Addlesberg convinced two of the most popular cricket clubs to switch to baseball and supplied the locals with equipment he imported from New Orleans. Two teams were created in , the Southern and Four Roses. They began to play in and baseball has been played on the Mosquito Coast almost continuously since that time, but the entire region has long since been incorporated into the Republic of Nicaragua. The first 'official' game took place in between Managua and Granada. Carter Donaldson, who was the U.S. Consul in Nicaragua at the time, founded the first continuous team in 1904. United States Marines stationed in Nicaragua in the early part of the 20th century were also credited for bringing the sport to the country, and popularizing it in the area.\n\nProfessional baseball came to an end in Nicaragua in 1967, after years of political and economic problems. In the 1970s, however, baseball again became popular after the success of the Nicaragua national baseball team.\nIn the 1980s, popularity of baseball in the country began to decline. After the Nicaraguan civil war, baseball began to flourish again. The policy of Nicaraguan professional baseball before the 1990s was to discourage the recruitment of Nicaraguan players by Major League Baseball scouts. On August 6, 1990, the San Francisco Giants signed two players from Nicaragua, and considered building a baseball academy in a move that was seen as a step to normalizing the relationship between Nicaragua and Major League Baseball. During the 1996 Nicaraguan presidential election, candidates, Arnoldo Alemán, and Daniel Ortega, promised increased funding for the Nicaraguan national baseball team.\n\nIn the spring of 2004, professional baseball returned to Nicaragua for the first time since 1967. In a typical modern-day game, teams have sets of cheerleaders, as well as team mascots, and marching bands who play throughout the game. Dennis Martínez National Stadium, located in Managua, Nicaragua, is used by the Indios del Bóer of the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League. The stadium has been described being in poor shape by many, including Nicaraguan native, and former Major League Baseball pitcher Dennis Martínez, whom the stadium is named after. The World Baseball Classic has been criticized by NBC Sports writer Joe Connor, after the WBC invited national baseball teams from China, Australia, and Italy, over teams from Nicaragua, and Colombia, where the sport is considerably more popular. In 2009 it was announced that a privately funded baseball academy would be built by the International Baseball Association in Villa El Carmen.\n\nFourteen players born in Nicaragua have competed in Major League Baseball. Currently, Everth Cabrera, Erasmo Ramirez, and Cheslor Cuthbert are the only three active Nicaraguan players in Major League Baseball. A fourth Nicaraguan, J. C. Ramírez, has pitched in Major League Baseball but is not currently on a major league roster.\n\nThe Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League (\"La Liga Nicaragüense de Beisbol Profesional\" in Spanish) is the professional baseball league in Nicaragua. There are four teams that compete against each other, the Indios del Bóer, the Tigres del Chinandega, the Leones de León, and the Orientales de Granada. There is one defunct team, the Fieras del San Fernando.\n\n\n"}

The 19th-century painter Francis Millet was a great uncle who died in the \"Titanic\" disaster. She became a child actor, performing in Paris on stage and in silent films for a few years, having signed with theatrical agent André Charlot. Bordoni made her first appearance on the stage at the age of thirteen, at the \"Variétés\", Paris.\n\nShe went to the United States on 28 December 1907, in steerage on the \"S. S. La Provence\". Bordoni's year of birth is given in standard theatrical biographies as 1895, but her real birth year is 1885. She was 22 on the ship's passenger list when she arrived in the United States in 1907. She went first to Reno, Nevada, where her father had reportedly settled previously.\n\nBordoni made her Broadway debut in a Shubert brothers production of \"Broadway to Paris\" at the Winter Garden Theatre and was a successor to Anna Held as Broadway's idea of French piquancy and Continental flavor. She was in \"Miss Information\" (1915) and successive productions of \"Hitchy-Koo\" (1917 and 1918). 1919 audiences saw Bordoni in \"Sleeping Partners\" co-starring with H. B. Warner at the Bijou. In 1920 her \"captivating voice and presence\" graced \"As You Were\" at the Central Theater.\n\nBordoni introduced George Gershwin's hit song \"Do It Again\" with vivacity and verve in the 1922 Broadway show \"The French Doll\" at the Lyceum. The title of the show became her nickname. She also starred in \"Little Miss Bluebeard\" (1923) and \"Naughty Cinderella\" (1925) by Avery Hopwood, about which the theatre critic for the \"New York Times\" said, \"Of Miss Bordoni one can report only what has been reported many times. Her voice, her accent and particularly her reeling eyes are, as ever, unmistakably attractive.\"\n\nNoted for her seductive brown eyes and coquettish personality, Irène Bordoni is probably best remembered from musical theatre as the star of the 1928 Cole Porter musical \"Paris\" that featured the song \"Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love)\" which became Porter's first big success. Bordoni would record and sing many times live and on radio another Cole Porter song, \"Let's Misbehave\" with Irving Aaronson and His Commanders dance band. The song has been included on the soundtrack of five motion pictures including \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)\" (1972), \"Pennies from Heaven\" (1981) and \"Bullets Over Broadway\" (1994). Porter later included Bordoni's name in the lyrics of his song \"You're the Top\" (\"you're the eyes of Irène Bordoni\") from the musical \"Anything Goes\" (1934).\n\nThroughout her Broadway career, Bordoni was renowned for wearing only the most stylish of clothes, including costumes by Erté. During this time, Bordoni appeared in Lucky Strike cigarette advertisements with the quip, \"I smoke a Lucky to keep petite,\" which was said to have contributed to the tremendous increase in women's smoking in the 1920s.\n\nBordoni wore her hair with trademark bangs, which she helped to popularize; indeed her 'look' was successfully emulated not only by her admirers but also by late 1920s budding Broadway starlet Claudette Colbert. She was stockbroker W. D. Hutton's first customer when he opened his branch office on West 57th Street.\n\nDuring the 1930s, she was a guest singer on many variety programs as well as being featured on The RKO Hour. Bordoni pleased audiences on both sides of the Atlantic, as with Irving Berlin's \"It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow\" in London's West End in 1939.\n\nBordoni made her Hollywood debut in Warner Brothers \"Show of Shows\" (1928). In 1929 her Broadway play \"Paris\" was adapted to a talkie, also called \"Paris\", for which she reprised her starring role. The film used the Vitaphone sound-on-disc sound system and was shot in early Technicolor. That year Bordoni also performed \"Just an Hour of Love\" (by Al Bryan and Ed Ward) for the Warner Brothers film \"The Show of Shows\" produced by Darryl F. Zanuck. In 1932 Max Fleischer featured her in his follow-the-bouncing-ball Screen Song cartoon \"Just A Gigolo\".\n\nHer status as a major star of the American stage was such that in his song \"You're The Top\", Cole Porter included the reference \"You’re the eyes of Irene Bordoni\". During the 1930s, she continued to perform on stage and starred in another Warner Brothers musical comedy film. In 1940, Bordoni was part of another major Broadway success with the Irving Berlin musical \"Louisiana Purchase\" and again reprised her role in the Paramount Pictures film \"Louisiana Purchase\" (1941) with Bob Hope. She had another success in the role of \"Bloody Mary\" in the 1951 national tour of the musical \"South Pacific\".\n\nBordoni was married to actor Edgar Becman whom she divorced in 1917. She married again on 24 October 1918 to Broadway producer and lyricist E. Ray Goetz who produced many of her Broadway shows (and whose sister Dorothy Goetz was Irving Berlin's first wife) but they divorced in 1929.\n\nAt the height of her international appeal she maintained homes in increasingly stylish New York neighborhoods: from 230 West End Avenue to 108 East 78th Street to 104 East 40th Street — as well as in Paris and Monte Carlo. She invested in real estate in Palm Beach in the 1920s during the Florida land boom. Bordoni was later associated with theatrical agent and producer Avery Galen Bogue (1896–1951).\n\nShe died on 19 March 1953 at Jewish Memorial Hospital in Manhattan, New York City. She was interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery, Hartsdale, New York.\n\nBordoni introduced or was the first interpreter of the following songs:\n\n"}
{"id": "16655646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16655646", "title": "Italian Spiderman", "text": "Italian Spiderman\n\nItalian Spiderman is an Australian film parody of Italian action–adventure films of the 1960s and 1970s, first released on YouTube in 2007. The parody purports to be a \"lost Italian film\" by Alrugo Entertainment, an Australian film-making collective formed by Dario Russo, Tait Wilson, David Ashby, Will Spartalis and Boris Repasky.\n\nOstensibly an Italian take on the comic book superhero Spider-Man, the film is a reference to foreign movies that misappropriate popular American superheroes such as the Turkish film \"3 Dev Adam\", and licensed series such as the Japanese TV series \"Spider-Man\", both of which alter the character of Spider-Man for foreign audiences. Other notable entries include the Indian version of \"Superman\" (1987), \"The Three Fantastic Supermen\" (1967) and \"La Mujer Murcielago (The Batwoman)\" (1968). It also resembles the movie \"Bathman dal pianeta Eros\" (1982).\n\nA trailer was released, followed by a full-length feature made up of ten mini-episodes.\n\nIn the middle of a party, an asteroid from a distant galaxy falls to Earth and is taken by professor Bernardi (Carmine Russo) for research. He discovers the asteroid has a substance that can create duplicates from any living being and decides that Italian Spiderman (David Ashby, credited as \"Franco Franchetti\"), a fat, rude, chain-smoking, and powerful superhero, is the only man capable of holding custody of the valuable asteroid.\n\nAs soon as Professor Bernardi gives Italian Spiderman the asteroid, he is attacked by the terrible Captain Maximum (Leombruno Tosca) who is interested in using the asteroid for his own evil plans. Foiled in his attempt to steal the asteroid from Bernardi, he transforms the Professor into a snake. Captain Maximum later intercepts the Italian Spiderman and takes the asteroid, although he gives Italian Spiderman a chance to win it by beating Maximum in a surf contest. When Captain Maximum notices the obviously superior surfing skills of Italian Spiderman, Maximum attempts to win by cheating. His efforts fail, however, as Italian Spiderman summons the help of penguins (which hurl themselves at Captain Maximum and his henchwomen) and wins.\nWhen Italian Spiderman returns home, he is again attacked by Captain Maximum's henchmen, where a tranquiliser dart causes the hero to collapse.\n\nWaking up in Captain Maximum's lair he witnesses how the professor is forced to use the powers of duplication on one of Captain Maximum's henchmen. Italian Spiderman is forced to watch as the professor is shot by Maximum. The furious Italian Spiderman attacks Maximum's henchmen, killing many in a surprisingly gory battle sequence. Despite Italian Spiderman's efforts the Professor dies but in his last moments gives the Italian Spiderman the potion. Italian Spiderman again attacks the headquarters of Captain Maximum. Despite having the potion, Italian Spiderman overwhelms by his powers alone the newfound army (showing in the process to have a venomous bite and removable moustaches that can double as razor-sharp boomerangs). Later, Italian Spiderman returns home with the Professor's niece, Jessica (Susanna Dekker). When a gigantic Captain Maximum lays siege to the city, Italian Spiderman finally drinks the potion, growing to the same height of Captain Maximum and battling him until the titles roll.\n\n\nThe project began as a trailer for a non-existent film, produced as a student film at Flinders University by director Dario Russo for his final year Screen Production project. The \"trailer\" was shot, over the course of one day, on 16 mm film using an older style camera to achieve an authentic look for the films of that era.\n\nThe trailer stars \"Franco Franchetti\" (David Ashby) as \"Italian Spiderman\" and features \"Jessica\" portrayed by actress Susanna Dekker, in the infamous scene with the line \"Fammi un macchiato, pronto\". \n\nPublicized as an actual lost Italian action film from the late 1960s, the film was later uploaded onto YouTube on 8 November 2007 where it has gained a massive cult following with 6.5 million hits as of 10 September 2018. With some of mainstream media taking interest in the film, this led to the South Australian Film Corporation giving the filmmakers funding for ten more short films.\n\nThe first installment of the \"feature film\" premiered across the Internet on 22 May 2008; further instalments followed on a weekly basis.\n\nThe series was well-received, but ended on a cliffhanger. The May 2010 announcement of the end of Alrugo Entertainment cast doubt on the possible continuation of the project.\n\nOn 24 October 2011, a video announcement was made declaring the end of the Italian Spiderman project and the formation of a new production company between Dario Russo and David Ashby, called Dinosaur. The same video also officially announced the duo's television show, \"Danger 5\".\n\n\"\"Italian Spiderman theme\"/\"Bangarang\"\" Enzo Bontempi (Record Kicks / Soulful Torino Records RK45 017/STR003)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4238273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4238273", "title": "Kathina", "text": "Kathina\n\nKathina is a Buddhist festival which comes at the end of Vassa, the three-month rainy season retreat for Theravada Buddhists in Bangladesh (known as Kaṭhina Cībar Dān), Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand. The season during which a monastery may hold Kathina is one month long, beginning after the full moon of the eleventh month in the Lunar calendar (usually October).\n\nIt is a time of giving, for the laity to express gratitude to bhikkhus (Buddhist monks). Lay Buddhists bring donations to temples, especially new robes for the monks. In Sri Lanka offers Atapirikara අටපිරිකර (Eightfold Requisites).\n\nKathina is a Pali word referring to the wooden frame used to measure the length and width by which the robes of Buddhist monks are cut. As the legend goes, thirty bhikkhus were journeying with the intention of spending Vassa with Gautama Buddha. However, the rains began before they reached their destination and they had to stop at Saketa. According to Buddha's guidelines for Vassa, mendicant monks shouldn't travel during the rainy season as they may unintentionally harm crops and/or insects during their journey. As such, the monks had to stop.\n\nThe bhikkhus passed their time together without conflict and practicing Dhamma so afterwards, the Buddha rewarded the monks by demonstrating a way to practice sharing and generosity. A lay disciple had previously donated pieces of cloth to the Buddha, so the Buddha now gave the pieces to the group of monks and told them to make it into a robe and then offer it as a gift to one of them. A frame, called a Kathina, was used to hold the pieces while they were being made into one robe.\n\nKathein (, from Pali ) refers to the ceremony during which yellow robes called \"matho thingan\" () are offered to the sangha between the first waning day of Thadingyut (, approximately October) and the full moon day of Tazaungmon (, approximately November) in the Burmese calendar. During this period, certain rules of the Vinaya are relaxed for monks. Kahtein trees called \"badaytha bin\" (), on which offerings like money are hung, are also offered.\n\nKathin () in Thailand (there is also the transcription \"gathin\" in use) is the name for the robes of an ordained monk. \n\nThe ceremony of \"kathina\" is called \"Thod Kathin\" (). The Thai lunar calendar reckons the day after the 11th full moon as \"Waning 1, Evening, Moon 11\" (). The presentation of \"kathin\" by the King of Thailand's representative is called \"The Royal Kathin Ceremony\" and often has been an occasion for one of Thailand's Royal Barge Processions.\n\nThe Kathin Festival is a traditional Buddhist festival celebrated by villagers in Isan and Laos. Colourful parades and offering ceremonies at the end of monks' retreat at local temples. On Ok Phansa day of the full moon, villagers and city dwellers will go to their local temple for prayers and paying respect to the sacred. Ok Phansa is also the beginning of a 30-day period of merit-making which affords a special opportunity for prayers to Buddha and for the presentation of gifts to the monks for preserving the faith. This 30-day span of merit making and religious gift giving is referred to as Thord Pha Gathin.\n\nThord Gathin takes its name from the \"laying down\" of new robes to the monks. The offering of new, saffron robes to the monks is particularly meritorious and important. Other gifts to the monks may include basic utensils, toiletries, writing materials, and food. Gift-giving is an act of appreciation and gratitude to the monks. Individuals or community groups (such as a village) may perform them. Many villagers combine efforts by collecting cash donations for the maintenance of their local temple. Such donations are vividly arranged on a \"money tree\" which looks rather like a colourful Christmas tree bedecked with banknotes as the \"foliage\". The money tree is ceremoniously paraded to the temple, led by a team of drummers and musicians, with the villagers carrying their own individual gifts on trays bringing up the rear. In this way at Thord Gathin, the lay-people of Thailand reaffirm their faith and, in a joyous fashion, bring gifts to Buddha and his servants.\n\n "}

The first Minnesota Fringe Festival took place in 1994, with 53 shows presented at six venues across Minneapolis's Cedar-Riverside neighborhood.

Since 1998, it has taken place during late July and early August, consistently running for 11 days annually since 2005, when it expanded from a 10-day run.\n\nThe festival has grown since 1994, in terms of the number of shows presented, venues occupied, and tickets purchased, to become the largest unjuried fringe festival in the United States, a distinction it held until 2018 when it was overtaken by the Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival and the Washington, D.C., Capital Fringe Festival. In 2010, over 50,000 tickets were sold for the first time, and in 2015, more performances took place (909) and tickets were sold (50,338) than in any other year. The most shows (177) were presented in 2013, and two years, 2004 and 2015, tied for the most venues utilized by the festival, with 24 apiece. This value includes traditional theaters as well as site-specific venues, which can vary from year to year and have included a loading dock, a bedroom, a bathroom, and a moving car. The fourth annual festival in 1997 recorded both the fewest shows (35) and the lowest attendance (4,300), and tied with 1995 and 1996 for the fewest venues occupied (five). The most recent festival was held from August 2–12, 2018 and the next will be held August 1–11, 2019.\n"}

It includes jazz clubs, clubs, dancehalls and historic venues such as theatres. A jazz club is a venue where the primary entertainment is the performance of live jazz music. Jazz clubs are usually a type of nightclub or bar, which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. Jazz clubs were in large rooms in the eras of Orchestral jazz and big band jazz, when bands were large and often augmented by a string section. Large rooms were also more common in the Swing era, because at that time, jazz was popular as a dance music, so the dancers needed space to move. With the transition to 1940s-era styles like Bebop and later styles such as soul jazz, small combos of musicians such as quartets and trios were mostly used, and the music became more of a music to listen to, rather than a form of dance music. As a result, smaller clubs with small stages became practical.\n\nIn the 2000s, jazz clubs may be found in the basements of larger residential buildings, in storefront locations or in the upper floors of retail businesses. They can be rather small compared to other music venues, such as rock music clubs, reflecting the intimate atmosphere of jazz shows and long-term decline in popular interest in jazz. Despite being called \"clubs\", these venues are usually not exclusive. Some clubs, however, have a cover charge if a live band is playing. Some jazz clubs host \"jam sessions\" after hours or on early evenings of the week. At jam sessions, both professional musicians and advanced amateurs will typically share the stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

If there are more than five players, the dealer may reduce the number of cards dealt to each person, three cards being the minimum. After dealing the remaining deck is placed in the center of the table.\n\nTwo decks of cards without jokers are needed. The dealer, chosen at random, deals 6 cards to each player in clockwise direction.

If he is unable to do so, he must draw three cards. The other players will then try to restore the cards to their proper groups. Any invalid cards left on the table will be later incorporated into valid groups by other players.\n"}

She has also written \"Message from Forever\" (1998), another novel based on Australian Aboriginal themes.\n\nMarlo Morgan self-published a book in 1990 titled \"Mutant Message Down Under\", which purported to chronicle the journey of a middle-aged, white, American woman with a group of 62 desert Aborigines, the \"Real People\", across the continent of Australia. The author states the book was written after the fact inspired by actual experience.\n\n\"Mutant Message Down Under\" quickly attained word of mouth popularity with the New Age movement in the United States, was picked up for bookstore distribution by Bookpeople, then consequently picked up by giant publishing firm HarperCollins, and marketed as fiction by them. Nearly a million copies of the HarperCollins publication have been sold around the world. Morgan completed many lecture tours promoting the book in the United States and Europe. In her lectures Ms Morgan speaks of her actual experience with the \"Real People\" and states she is an Aborigine.\n\nAccording to the 90-page report published by the Perth-based \"Dumbartung Aboriginal Corporation\", a survey of Aboriginal groups in Central and Western Australia failed to uncover any indication whatsoever of Ms Morgan’s presence in the area or of the existence of the \"Real People\" tribe. They claim that Aboriginal groups believe Ms Morgan’s desert journey to be fabricated and that her book and teaching lack credibility. The \"Dumbartung Aboriginal Corporation\" stated that it was deeply offensive to Aboriginal people for a white person to be misrepresenting Aboriginal culture for self-promotion and profit. Aboriginal people expressed anger that Ms Morgan’s false message is being accepted as fact by a naive American and European market and were extremely concerned about the resulting long-term implications for their culture.\n\nIn 1996 a group of Aboriginal elders, seriously disturbed by the book's implications, received a grant to travel to the States and confront Marlo Morgan about her book and to try to prevent a Hollywoodisation of it. She admitted publicly that she had faked it but this received little publicity in the USA. The Aboriginal people are angry that this book continues to be promoted and sold widely because it gives a false picture of their traditional culture and of their current political and social status. This is regarded as damaging to their struggle for survival.\n\n"}

{"id": "8676284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8676284", "title": "Musical gesture", "text": "Musical gesture\n\nIn music, gesture is any movement, either physical (bodily) or mental (imaginary). As such \"gesture\" includes both categories of movements required to produce sound and categories of perceptual moves associated with those gestures. The concept of musical gestures has received much attention in various musicological disciplines (e.g. music analysis, music therapy, music psychology, NIME) in recent years.\n\nFor example, the \"musical\" movement from a close-position tonic C major chord to a close-position dominant G major chord requires on the piano the physical movement from each white key of the first chord to the right (in space, upwards in pitch) four white keys or steps. Thus gesture includes both characteristic physical movements by performers and characteristic melodies, phrases, chord progressions, and arpeggiations produced by (or producing) those movements.\n\nThe concept of musical gestures encompasses a large territory stretching from details of sound-production to more global emotive and aesthetic images of music, and also include considerations of cultural-stylistic vs. more universal modes of expression. In all cases, it is believed that musical gestures manifest the primordial role of human movement in music. For this reason, scholars speak of embodied music cognition in the sense that listeners relate musical sound to mental images of gestures, i.e. that listening (or even merely imagining music) also is a process of incessant mental re-enactment of musical gestures.\n\nAcknowledging the multimodal nature of music perception, embodied music cognition could represent a change of paradigm in music theory and other music related research, research which has often tended to exclude considerations of bodily movement from its conceptual apparatus in favour of focus on more abstract, notation-based elements of music. Focusing on musical gestures provides a coherent and unifying perspective for a renewal of music theory and other music research.\n\nA subset of musical gestures is what could be called music-related body movement, which can be seen from either the performer's or the perceiver's point of view:\n\nThe first mathematical definition of gesture is given in the paper \"Formulas, Diagrams, and Gestures in Music\" (Journal of Mathematics and Music, Vol 1, Nr. 1 2007) by Guerino Mazzola (University of Minnesota) and Moreno Andreatta (IRCAM in Paris). A gesture is a configuration of curves in space and time. More formally, a gesture is a digraph morphism from a \"skeleton\" of addressed points to a \"body\", a spatial digraph of a topological category (in the musical case: time, position and pitch). Since the set of gestures of given skeleton and topological category defines a topological category, one may define gestures of gestures, so-called hypergestures.\n\nIndian vocalists move their hands while improvising melody. Although every vocalist has an idiosyncratic gestural style, the motion of the hand and voice are connected through various logics, and many students gesturally resemble their teachers. Nikki Moran, at the University of London, has done research on this topic, and it is one of the subjects of Martin Clayton and Laura Leante's Musical Experience Project at the Open University.\n\nClayton has published a paper on gestural interaction in Indian music performance: \"Time, Gesture and Attention in a Khyal Performance.\" \"Asian Music\", 38 (2), 71–96.\n\nMatt Rahaim, a vocalist and ethnomusicologist, has published a book on the relationship between vocalization and gesture in Indian vocal music: \"Musicking Bodies: Gesture and Voice in Hindustani Music\". Rahaim's work approaches gesture and vocalization as parallel expressions of melody, investigates isomorphisms between gesture space and raga space, and studies the transmission and inheritance of \"paramparic bodies\"--vocal/postural/gestural dispositions handed down through teaching lineages.\n\nRobert Hatten (2004) has been using the concept of musical gestures to denote inner-musical qualities:\n\"Musical gesture is biologically and culturally grounded in communicative human movement. Gesture draws upon the close interaction (and intermodality) of a range of human perceptual and motor systems to synthesize the energetic shaping of motion through time into significant events with unique expressive force. The biological and cultural motivations of musical gesture are further negotiated within the conventions of a musical style, whose elements include both the discrete (pitch, rhythm, meter) and the analog (dynamics, articulation, temporal pacing). Musical gestures are emergent gestalts that convey affective motion, emotion, and agency by fusing otherwise separate elements into continuities of shape and force.\"\n\n\n"}

A sequel to \"My Girl\" (1991), its plot follows a now-teenaged Vada Sultenfuss, who travels from her home in suburban Pennsylvania to Los Angeles to find more information about her deceased mother.\n\nA book based on the script was written by Patricia Hermes in 1994.\n\nIn the spring of 1974, nearly two years following the events of the first film, Vada Sultenfuss sets out on a quest to learn more about her deceased biological mother. She has matured from the spunky, eleven-year-old hypochondriac to a lively, yet more serious teenager seeking independence. Her father Harry and his new wife Shelly DeVoto, whom he dated in the first film, are expecting a baby. They still live in the Sultenfuss funeral home in Madison, Pennsylvania, while Harry's brother Phil has moved to Los Angeles, where he works as a mechanic. Gramoo, Vada's grandmother, is no longer alive. Vada still has her mood ring from two years earlier and wears it in memory of her late best friend Thomas J., who died retrieving it for her after she had lost it. \n\nTo accommodate the new baby, Vada moves out of her bedroom and into Gramoo's old room, and it brings further problems with adjustment. Vada even thinks about getting her own apartment while spending a night out with her father. Vada is given a school assignment to write an essay on someone she admires but has never met. She decides to write about her mother but has few sources to go on, which are all confined to a small box. Among its contents are programs of plays her mother was in, a passport, and a mystery paper bag with a date scribbled on it. Vada expresses her desire to travel someday, so Shelly concocts a plan for her to travel to Los Angeles during her spring break, where she can stay with her uncle Phil and do research on her mother, who was from there. Harry initially does not go along with the idea, believing Vada is too young to be traveling by herself, but ultimately allows her take the five-day trip.\n\nUpon arriving in L.A., Vada finds herself confronting a boy her age named Nick, who comes to pick her up at the airport. Nick is the son of Phil's girlfriend Rose, the owner of the car repair shop where Phil works. As a favor to Phil, though annoyed at first about sacrificing his own spring break, Nick helps Vada with the difficult search of learning more about her mother. Their investigation is stalled when Vada learns that her mother's old high school burned down, but she and Nick still manage to track down a yearbook from a year her mother attended. \n\nVada and Nick meet several people who knew her mother. Some of the things she finds out do not sit well with her, such as her mother being suspended from school for smoking. Two of these acquaintances have a look at the paper bag from Vada's small box of memories about her mother, but neither can decipher it. When another blurts out the name Jeffrey Pommeroy, thinking that he is Vada's father, Vada is crushed and wonders why her father never mentioned this person. Eventually, though with some hesitation, she goes to see Jeffrey, her mother's first husband. He provides Vada with valuable information to help with her essay, including home movies and the answer behind the date written on the paper bag. Seeing the home movies touches Vada, as she watches her mother act, as well as sing a song called \"Smile\".\n\nMeanwhile, Phil has trouble proving his love to Rose after a man frequently shows up at the repair shop and continuously flatters her. When Phil finally gets the courage to show Rose what she means to him, he proposes. As Vada is ready to head home, she and Nick share a goodbye kiss at the airport before she boards the plane. In her backpack, she finds earrings Nick placed there for her newly pierced ears. When Vada returns home, she realizes Shelly just had a baby boy and heads to the hospital to see her new brother. To calm his crying, Vada sings \"Smile\" while holding him. Vada's essay on her mother receives an A+, and she hopes to share what she learned during her trip with her brother someday.\n\n\nThe film debuted at number 4 at the U.S. box office, earning approximately $5 million during its opening weekend. It went on to gross $17,359,799 domestically.\n\nPeter Rainer of the \"Los Angeles Times\" was critical of the film, writing that its \"dubious scenario is made even more so by the treacly approach of director Howard Zieff and screenwriter Janet Kovalcik. Everything in this film is sugared with sermons about the importance of Being Yourself. Vada doesn't experience any twinges of rage at the loss of her mother or any misgivings about her quest. She's preternaturally mature.\"\n\nStephen Holden of \"The New York Times\", however, commended it as \"appealingly sentimental,\" adding: \"Where the first movie forced Vada to face some jarring realities (a best friend's death, a grandmother's senility) and was heavily salted with mortuary humor, the atmosphere of the sequel is softer and more golden. Among other things, the film is a nostalgic valentine to Los Angeles in palmier days when the city still wore the mystique of a laid-back, post-hippie lotus land.\"\n\nRoger Ebert awarded the film two out of four stars, noting that it \"seems inspired mostly by the opportunity to recycle the title of a successful film. Scrutinizing the popularity of the first film, perhaps the producers thought it depended on gentle sentimentality, in which a likable young girl deals with the loss of loved ones. As an idea for a series, this is fairly dangerous...  I think it's time to give Vada a break, before she becomes a necrophile, and starts spending all of her time upstairs like Emily Dickinson, writing bleak little poems.\" Joe Leydon of \"Variety\" deemed the film a \"pleasant, painless and, as sequels go, genuinely ambitious,\" but conceded that it \"may not be enough...  to broaden its appeal beyond its obvious target audience of preteen and young adolescent girls (and, of course, tag-along parents and boyfriends).\"\n\nColumbia-TriStar Home Entertainment released the film on VHS on June 11, 1996. It was released for the first time on DVD in the United States on December 3, 2002.\n\nFor her performance, Chlumsky won a Young Artist Award for \"Best Performance by a Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture\"; Thomson and O'Brien were also nominated for Young Artist Awards for their roles.\n\nFor several years \"Still My Girl\" was proposed as the third motion picture in the \"My Girl\" movie franchise and it was in development at Columbia Pictures. In his 2003 United Kingdom talk show interview with host Michael Parkinson, Dan Aykroyd stated that Columbia had an interest in getting this off the ground and strong interest in Anna Chlumsky returning to her role as Vada. In 2009, both Chlumsky and Aykroyd were still attached to the project but as the time passed it was becoming less and less likely that it would ever go into production.\n\n"}

It says that a strategy profile of a finite extensive-form game is a subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) if and only if there exist no profitable one-shot deviations for each subgame and every player. In simpler terms, if no player can increase their payoffs by deviating a single decision, or period, from their original strategy, then the strategy that they have chosen is a SPE. As a result, no player can profit from deviating from the strategy for one period and then reverting to the strategy. \n\nFurthermore, the one-shot deviation principle is very important for infinite horizon games, in which the principle typically does not hold, since it is not plausible to consider an infinite number of strategies and payoffs in order to solve. In an infinite horizon game where the discount factor is less than 1, a strategy profile is a subgame perfect equilibrium if and only if it satisfies the one-shot deviation principle.\n\nThe following is the paraphrased definition from Watson (2013)\n\nTo check whether strategy \"s\" is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, we have to ask every player \"i\" and every subgame, if considering \"s\", there is a strategy \"s’\" that yields a strictly higher payoff for player \"i\" than does \"s\" in the subgame. This analysis is equivalent to looking at single deviations from \"s\", meaning \"s’\" differs from s at only one information set. Note that the choices associated with \"s\" and \"s’\" are the same at all nodes that are successors of nodes in the information set where s and \"s’\" prescribe different actions. \n\nConsider a symmetric game with two players in which each player makes binary choice decisions, A or B, in three sequences. There are 8 (2) total number of pure strategies for each player: {AAA, AAB, ABA, ABB, BBB, BBA, BAB, BAA}. In this example, consider that a player chooses strategy (AAA). To check whether this strategy is a SPE, the one-shot deviation principle states that the player needs to check the payoffs of only three other strategies which differ from the original strategy by a single deviation, instead of all seven others. These three strategies are: (BAA), (ABA), and (AAB). If none of these three strategies yields a higher payoff than (AAA), then the player can conclude that (AAA) is a SPE.\n"}

In certain applications, oral interpretation is also a theatre art – as in reader's theatre, in which a work of literature is performed with manuscripts in hand or, more traditionally, using stools and music stands; and especially chamber theatre, which dispenses with manuscripts and uses what may be described as essentialist costuming and stage lighting, and suggestive scenery.\n\nThe term is succinctly defined by Paul Campbell (\"The Speaking and Speakers of Literature\"; Dickinson, 1967) as the \"oralization of literature\"; or more eloquently, if less intelligibly, by Charlotte Lee and Timothy Gura (\"Oral Interpretation\"; Houghton-Mifflin, 1997) as \"the art of communicating to an audience a work of literary art in its intellectual, emotional, and aesthetic entirety\". Historically essential to Charlotte Lee's definition of oral interpretation is the fact the performer is \"reading from a manuscript\". This perspective, once the majority view, has long since become the minority opinion on the question; so that whether one is or is not reading from a manuscript, the art retains the same name.\n\nVoice and movement technique is \"opsis\" (\"spectacle\") while oral interpretation is, conceptually, \"melopoiia\" (\"music technique\").\n\nBecause oral interpretation is an essential dramatic element in all performance art (even dance, in which the oral element is most typically a silent element), all actors, singers, storytellers, etc., are \"interpreters\" – but not all interpreters are necessarily actors, or singers, or storytellers, and so on. When, for example, the writer David Sedaris reads one of his stories on stage, or when Leonard Cohen performs one of his lyric poems, they are both engaged in the art of oral interpretation. But Sedaris is no actor, and even Cohen himself would say that \"he\" is no singer.\n\nIn the United States, there is a historic and purely academic argument as to whether oral interpretation and drama/theatre performance are different names for the same thing or whether they are completely different art forms. This argument is almost exclusively found at colleges and universities whose theatre programs evolved in departments historically or currently called \"English and Speech\", \"Speech and Dramatic Arts\" or \"Communication and Theatre Arts\". The argument is rarely heard in theatre programs that did not evolve out of English and/or Speech Communication departments, such as those associated with schools/colleges of music.\n\nIn high schools across the United States, Oral Interpretation is a very highly valued competition event, particularly in the mid-western states, such as Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota. Students select a work of literature, make a cutting of the literature to fit a time limit of 10 minutes, and perform it in several rounds at tournaments across their state. The piece must be from a published, worthwhile piece of literature, with the exception of Readers Theatre. The categories of said event are as follows:\n"}

It had similar elements to Cirque du Soleil's retired Los Angeles resident show in \"Iris\" (which was also themed on cinema) written and created by Philippe Decouflé, and had a 38-person onstage cast with actress Ruby Lewis in the lead as Indigo. \"Paramour\" began preview shows on April 16, 2016, with an official premiere on May 25, 2016. It closed exactly one year after its first preview show, on 16 April 2017.\n\nDuring previews, \"Paramour\" got off to a strong start and grossed over $1 million in its first six shows.\n\nThe show was directed by French director-choreographer Philippe Decouflé, who was also the director of the cinema themed Cirque du Soleil show \"Iris\". The rest of the creative team was also the same as for \"Iris\" apart from the assistant directors, composer and sound designer. Scenes from \"Iris\", such as aerial straps performed by the Atherton twins (who also performed in \"Iris\"), were incorporated into \"Paramour\". \n\nThe show closed on Broadway on 16 April 2017 after 31 previews and 366 performances.

This fusion of image and spoken word (both independent and interdependent) creates what William Wees called the \"Poetry-film\" genre. He suggested that \"a number of avant-garde film and video makers have created a synthesis of poetry and film that generates associations, connotations and metaphors neither the verbal nor the visual text would produce on its own\".\n\nThis genre of film was first explored in the 1920s by French Impressionists Germaine Dulac, Louis Delluc, Man Ray, Hans Richter, and others. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s this genre was further explored by the Beat Generation poets Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, and Herman Berlandt, and developed into a festival held annually at the Fort Mason Center in San Francisco, California.\n\nPoetry film is characterized by its nonlinear narrative style of editing, and stream of consciousness flow of images and spoken words, although linear narration and editing have been used to good effect in the creation of some poetry films (see Narrative). Generally, poetry film is created as a noncommercial production, but some attempts have been made to produce commercial films. Some poetry films have been used as instructional aids in literature classes to illustrate concepts such as allusion, simile, and metaphor.\n\nIn 1981, a group in Nashville, Tennessee, experimented with fusing spoken word, images, and sound into what was called \"poetry videos\". The concept was to create poetry videos, similar to music videos which were gaining popularity at the time, making poetry more acceptable as a commercial product. One video was produced with the assistance of the Tennessee State University communications department but was never commercially released.\n\nOne of the most famous poetry films ever produced was aired on the \"Smothers Brothers Show\" in 1968. The film was by Lawrence Ferlinghetti and was titled the \"Assassination Raga\". The film fused images of death, slow sitar music, and Ferlinghetti's spoken word poem about the assassination of the Kennedys.\n\nMore recently George Aguilar has developed a TV series of poetry films called Eyestruck. Performance Poet Hedwig Gorski was one of the first to successfully produce and direct her video poem using state arts funding. She received an Artist's Fellowship in 2002 for work fusing poetry and media.\n\nBeginning in the 21st century the genre of poetry films making also reached other parts of the world including India. Several traditional television professionals experimented with the art. In 2007 a non-profit organisation, Sadho, created an exclusive platform for screening of poetry films in India. The Sadho Poetry Film Festival is a biennial international film festival in New Delhi. The first Sadho Poetry Film Festival was organised in the year 2007.\n\nVishwajyoti Ghosh, Sidharth Pratap Singh, Parijat Kaul, Anjali Monteiro & K.P Jayasankar (Centre for Media and Cultural Studies), Nandan Saxena & Kavita Bahl, are some of poetry film makers from India. The list of poet-poetry film makers also includes Sidharth Saxena and Shashwat Mudgal from India and Tahira Rana from the UK.\n\nMrigankasekhar Ganguly, at his 22, made first poetry film in Bengali 'megh bolechhe' which was screened at Kolkata press club. In 2011 he directed his second poetry film 'Iti Apu' recited by Soumitra Chatterjee. In 2014, he directed Stark Electric Jesus based on the poem written by Malay Roy Choudhury. It breaks the narrative structure and creates a language of poetry in film.\n\nIranian director Abbas Kiarostami, is one of the most famous poetry filmmakers, who has received acclaims for his poetry films.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5378948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5378948", "title": "Postmodernist film", "text": "Postmodernist film\n\nPostmodernist film is a classification for works that articulate the themes and ideas of postmodernism through the medium of cinema. Postmodernist film attempts to subvert the mainstream conventions of narrative structure and characterization, and tests the audience's suspension of disbelief. Typically, such films also break down the cultural divide between high and low art and often upend typical portrayals of gender, race, class, genre, and time with the goal of creating something that does not abide by traditional narrative expression.\n\nPostmodernism is a complex paradigm of different philosophies and artistic styles. The movement emerged as a reaction to high modernism. Modernism is a paradigm of thought and viewing the world characterized in specific ways that postmodernism reacted against. Modernism was interested in master and meta narratives of history of a teleological nature. Proponents of modernism suggested that sociopolitical and cultural progress was inevitable and important for society and art. Ideas of cultural unity (i.e. the narrative of the West or something similar) and the hierarchies of values of class that go along with such a conception of the world is another marker of modernism. In particular, modernism insisted upon a divide between \"low\" forms of art and \"high\" forms of art (creating more value judgments and hierarchies). This dichotomy is particularly focused on the divide between official culture and popular culture. Lastly but, by no means comprehensively, there was a faith in the \"real\" and the future and knowledge and the competence of expertise that pervades modernism. At heart, it contained a confidence about the world and humankind's place in it.\n\nPostmodernism attempts to subvert and resist and differ from the preoccupations of modernism across many fields (music, history, art, cinema, etc.). Postmodernism emerged in a time not defined by war or revolution but rather by media culture. Unlike modernism, postmodernism does not have faith in master narratives of history or culture or even the self as an autonomous subject. Rather postmodernism is interested in contradiction, fragmentation, and instability. Postmodernism is often focused on the destruction of hierarchies and boundaries. The mixing of different times and periods or styles of art that might be viewed as \"high\" or \"low\" is a common practice in postmodern work. This practice is referred to as pastiche. Postmodernism takes a deeply subjective view of the world and identity and art, positing that an endless process of signification and signs is where any \"meaning\" lies. Consequently, postmodernism demonstrates what it perceives as a fractured world, time, and art.\n\nPostmodernist film – similar to postmodernism as a whole – is a reaction to the modernist works of its field, and to their tendencies. Modernist cinema, \"explored and exposed the formal concerns of the medium by placing them at the forefront of consciousness. Modernist cinema questions and made visible the meaning-production practices of film.\" The auteur theory and idea of an author producing a work from his singular vision guided the concerns of modernist film. \"To investigate the transparency of the image is modernist but to undermine its reference to reality is to engage with the aesthetics of postmodernism.\" The modernist film has more faith in the author, the individual, and the accessibility of reality itself than the postmodernist film.\n\nPostmodernism is in many ways interested in the liminal space that would be typically ignored by more modernist or traditionally narrative offerings. The idea is that the meaning is often generated most productively through the spaces and transitions and collisions between words and moments and images. Henri Bergson writes in his book \"Creative Evolution\", \"The obscurity is cleared up, the contradiction vanishes, as soon as we place ourselves along the transition, in order to distinguish states in it by making cross cuts therein in thoughts. The reason is that there is more in the transition than the series of states, that is to say, the possible cuts--more in the movement than the series of position, that is to say, the possible stops.\" The thrust of this argument is that the spaces between the words or the cuts in a film create just as much meaning as the words or scenes themselves.\n\nPostmodernist film is often separated from modernist cinema and traditional narrative film by three key characteristics. One of them is an extensive use of homage or pastiche, resulting from the fact that postmodern filmmakers are open to blending many disparate genres and tones within the same film. The second element is meta-reference or self-reflexivity, highlighting the construction and relation of the image to other images in media and not to any kind of external reality. A self-referential film calls the viewer's attention – either through characters' knowledge of their own fictional nature, or through visuals – that the movie itself is only a movie. This is sometimes achieved by emphasizing the unnatural look of an image which seems contrived. Another technique used to achieve meta-reference is the use of intertextuality, in which the film's characters reference or discuss other works of fiction. Additionally, many postmodern films tell stories that unfold out of chronological order, deconstructing or fragmenting time so as to, once again, highlight the fact that what is appearing on screen is constructed. A third common element is a bridging of the gap between highbrow and lowbrow activities and artistic styles – e.g., a parody of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling in which Adam is reaching for a McDonald's burger rather than the hand of God. This would exemplify the fusion of high and low because Michelangelo is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all painters, whereas fast food is commonly named among the lowbrow elements of modern society.\n\nThe use of homage and pastiche can, in and of itself, result in a fusion of high and low. For this reason, homage is sometimes accompanied by characters' value judgments as to the worth and cultural value of the works being parodied, ensuring the viewer understands whether the thing being referenced is considered highbrow or lowbrow.\n\nLastly, contradictions of all sorts – whether it be in visual technique, characters' morals, or other things – are crucial to postmodernism, and the two are in many cases irreconcilable. Any theory of postmodern film would have to be comfortable with paradoxes or contradictions of ideas and their articulation.\n\nRidley Scott's \"Blade Runner\" might be the best known postmodernist film. Ridley Scott's 1982 film is about a future dystopia where \"replicants\" (human cyborgs) have been invented and are deemed dangerous enough to hunt down when they escape. There is tremendous effacement of boundaries between genres and cultures and styles that are generally more separate along with the fusion of disparate styles and times that is a common trope in postmodernist cinema. \"The futuristic set and action mingle with drab 1940s clothes and offices, punk rock hairstyles, pop Egyptian style and oriental culture. The population is singularly multicultural and the language they speak is agglomeration of English, Japanese, German and Spanish. The film alludes to the private eye genre of Raymond Chandler and the characteristics of film noir as well as Biblical motifs and images.\" Here is a demonstration of the mixing of cultures and boundaries and styles of art. The film is playing with time (the various types of clothes) and culture and genre by mixing them all together to create the world of the film. The fusion of noir and science-fiction is another example of the film deconstructing cinema and genre. This is an embodiment of the postmodern tendency to destroy boundaries and genres into a self-reflexive product. \"The postmodern aesthetic of Blade Runner is thus the result of recycling, fusion of levels, discontinuous signifiers, explosion of boundaries, and erosion. The disconnected temporality of the replicants and the pastiche of the city are all an effect of a postmodern, postindustrial condition: wearing out, waste.\"\n\nQuentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" is another example of a postmodernist film. The film tells the interweaving stories of gangsters, a boxer, and robbers. The film breaks down chronological time and demonstrates a particular fascination with intertextuality: bringing in texts from both traditionally \"high\" and \"low\" realms of art. This foregrounding of media places the self as \"a loose, transitory combination of media consumption choices.\" \"Pulp Fiction\" fractures time (by the use of asynchronous time lines) and by using styles of prior decades and combining them together in the movie. By focusing on intertextuality and the subjectivity of time, \"Pulp Fiction\" demonstrates the postmodern obsession with signs and subjective perspective as the exclusive location of anything resembling meaning.\n\nAside from the aforementioned \"Blade Runner\" and \"Pulp Fiction\", postmodern cinema includes films such as:\n\n\n"}

The report showed that 800,000 people took part in the event, which resulted in an economic impact of £32 million.\n\nThe event, staged to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\", was inspired by a letter written by a 10-year-old girl, May McMurray, in 1912 to her father William, a bedroom steward on the Titanic who did not survive the sinking. The letter did not arrive until after the Titanic sailed, and was returned to the sender and is now on display at Liverpool's Maritime Museum.\n\nThe cost of the event, estimated at £1.5m, was partly met by European legacy funding from Liverpool's 2008 Capital of Culture year. Early forecasts suggested it resulted in a £12 million boost to the city's economy.\n\nWith initial expectations of around 250,000 people attending, immediately after the event it was estimated that 600,000 people watched the event over the three days.\n\nThe show was led by Royal de Luxe's artistic director, Jean-Luc Courcoult, who celebrated its conclusion by jumping into the River Mersey.\n\nThe story, written by Jean-Luc Courcoult, envisages the girl's uncle, a diver, searching the wreck of the Titanic, and having found his brother's letter, coming ashore to bring it and the news of the ship's fate to his niece.\n\nRising from the water at Liverpool's Salthouse Dock, the giant uncle wanders around the city in search of the girl, who simultaneously awakes in the city's Stanley Park and, accompanied by her dog Xolo, sets out to look for her uncle.\n\nThe two miss each other several times, finally meeting up at the King's Dock at the end of the second day of the event. The following day, the pair set out together for a final walk around the city centre, and then board a boat at Canning Dock and leave Liverpool via the River Mersey.\n\nBetween them, by the end of the three days, the giants covered a distance of 23 miles (37 km), taking in the areas around the football grounds of Liverpool F.C. and Everton F.C., the city centre, Pier Head, Chinatown, and the Albert Dock and King's Dock complexes.\n\nThe giants taking part in the event comprised the Little Giant Girl, measuring 9 metres (30 feet), the Giant Uncle, measuring 15 metres (50 feet), and the girl's dog, Xolo. The girl and the uncle are constructed from poplar wood, lime wood and steel, and have eyes made from street lights and hair made from horse hair. The dog, Xolo, is made from papier-mâché and steel. All three are controlled using ropes, pulleys and motors.\n\nDuring the three days, the puppets, cranes, and other equipment required a team of 110 operators, who call themselves \"Lilliputians\" after the characters from the 1726 Jonathan Swift novel \"Gulliver's Travels\". A total of 20 cranes were required to move them around the city. The uncle requires 31 people to control, with the girl operated by a team of 24 puppeteers, and the dog a team of 21.\n\nDuring the tour the giants were accompanied by a group of live musicians, and used a number of props, including the girl's boat, on which she sailed for part of her journey, her scooter, deck chair, bed, and radio.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "103078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=103078", "title": "Theatre director", "text": "Theatre director\n\nA theatre director or stage director is an instructor in the theatre field who oversees and orchestrates the mounting of a theatre production (a play, an opera, a musical, or a devised piece of work) by unifying various endeavours and aspects of production. The director's function is to ensure the quality and completeness of theatre production and to lead the members of the creative team into realizing their artistic vision for it. The director therefore collaborates with a team of creative individuals and other staff, coordinating research, stagecraft, costume design, props, lighting design, acting, set design, stage combat, and sound design for the production. If the production he or she is mounting is a new piece of writing or a (new) translation of a play, the director may also work with the playwright or translator. In contemporary theatre, after the playwright, the director is generally the primary visionary, making decisions on the artistic concept and interpretation of the play and its staging. Different directors occupy different places of authority and responsibility, depending on the structure and philosophy of individual theatre companies. Directors use a wide variety of techniques, philosophies, and levels of collaboration.\n\nIn ancient Greece, the birthplace of European drama, the writer bore principal responsibility for the staging of his plays. Actors were generally semi-professionals, and the director oversaw the mounting of plays from the writing process all the way through to their performance, often acting in them too, as Aeschylus for example did. The author-director would also train the chorus, sometimes compose the music, and supervise every aspect of production. The fact that the director was called \"didaskalos\", the Greek word for \"teacher,\" indicates that the work of these early directors combined instructing their performers with staging their work.\nIn medieval times, the complexity of vernacular religious drama, with its large scale mystery plays that often included crowd scenes, processions and elaborate effects, gave the role of director (or \"stage manager\" or \"pageant master\") considerable importance. A miniature by Jean Fouquet from 1460 (pictured) bears one of the earliest depictions of a director at work. Holding a prompt book, the central figure directs, with the aid of a long stick, the proceedings of the staging of a dramatization of the \"Martyrdom of Saint Apollonia\". According to Fouquet, the director's tasks included overseeing the erecting of a stage and scenery (there were no permanent, purpose-built theatre structures at this time, and performances of vernacular drama mostly took place in the open air), casting and directing the actors (which included fining them for those that infringed rules), and addressing the audience at the beginning of each performance and after each intermission.\n\nFrom Renaissance times up until the 19th century, the role of director was often carried by the \"actor-manager\". This would usually be a senior actor in a troupe who took the responsibility for choosing the repertoire of work, staging it and managing the company. This was the case for instance with Commedia dell'Arte companies and English actor-managers like Colley Cibber and David Garrick.\nThe modern theatre director can be said to have originated in the staging of elaborate spectacles of the Meininger Company under George II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. The management of large numbers of extras and complex stagecraft matters necessitated an individual to take on the role of overall coordinator. This gave rise to the role of the director in modern theatre, and Germany would provide a platform for a generation of emerging visionary theatre directors, such as Erwin Piscator and Max Reinhardt. Simultaneously, Constantin Stanislavski, principally an actor-manager, would set up the Moscow Art Theatre in Russia and similarly emancipate the role of the director as artistic visionary.\n\nThe French \"regisseur\" is also sometimes used to mean a stage director, most commonly in ballet. A more common term for theatre director in French is \"metteur en scène\".\n\nPost World War II, the actor-manager slowly started to disappear, and directing become a fully fledged artistic activity within the theatre profession. The director originating artistic vision and concept, and realizing the staging of a production, became the norm rather than the exception. Great forces in the emancipation of theatre directing as a profession were notable 20th-century theatre directors like Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, Vsevolod Meyerhold,\nYevgeny Vakhtangov, Michael Chekhov, Yuri Lyubimov (Russia), Orson Welles, Peter Brook, Peter Hall (Britain), Bertolt Brecht (Germany), Giorgio Strehler and Franco Zeffirelli (Italy).\n\nA cautionary note was introduced by the famed director Sir Tyrone Guthrie who said \"the only way to learn how to direct a play, is ... to get a group of actors simple enough to allow you to let you direct them, and direct\".\n\nA number of seminal works on directing and directors include Toby Cole and Helen Krich's 1972 \"Directors on Directing: A Sourcebook of the Modern Theatre\", Edward Braun's 1982 book \"The Director and the Stage: From Naturalism to Growtowski\" and Will's \"The Director in a Changing Theatre\" (1976).\n\nBecause of the relatively late emergence of theatre directing as a performing arts profession when compared with for instance acting or musicianship, a rise of professional vocational training programmes in directing can be seen mostly in the second half of the 20th century. Most European countries nowadays know some form of professional directing training, usually at drama schools or conservatoires, or at universities. In Britain, the tradition that theatre directors emerge from degree courses (usually in English literature) at the Oxbridge universities has meant that for a long time, professional vocational training did not take place at drama schools or performing arts colleges, although an increase in training programmes for theatre directors can be witnessed since the 1970s and 1980s. In American universities, the seminal directing program at the Yale School of Drama produced a number of pioneering directors with D.F.A. (Doctor of Fine Arts) and M.F.A. degrees in Drama (rather than English) who contributed to the expansion of professional resident theaters in the 1960s and 1970s. In the early days such programmes typically led to the staging of one major thesis production in the third (final) year. At the University of California, Irvine, Keith Fowler (a Yale D.F.A. and ex-producer of two LORT companies) led for many years a graduate programme based on the premise that directors are autodidacts who need as many opportunities to direct as possible. Under Fowler, graduate student directors would stage between five and ten productions during their three-year residencies, with each production receiving detailed critiques.\n\nAs with many other professions in the performing arts, theatre directors would often learn their skills \"on the job\"; to this purpose, theatres often employ trainee assistant directors or have in-house education schemes to train young theatre directors. Examples are the Royal National Theatre in London, which frequently organizes short directing courses, or the Orange Tree Theatre and the Donmar Warehouse on London's West End, which both employ resident assistant directors on a one-year basis for training purposes.\n\nDirecting is an artform that has grown with the development of theatre theory and theatre practice. With the emergence of new \ntrends in theatre, so too have directors adopted new methodologies and engaged in new practices.Interpretation of the drama, by the late twentieth century, had become central to the director’s work. Relativism and psychoanalytic theory influenced the work of innovative directors such as Peter Brook, Ingmar Bergman, Peter Stein, and George Strehler. \n\nOnce a show has opened (premiered before a regular audience), theatre directors are generally considered to have fulfilled their function. From that point forward the stage manager is left in charge of all essential concerns.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18007313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18007313", "title": "Xtreme Fighting Championships", "text": "Xtreme Fighting Championships\n\nXtreme Fighting Championships (XFC) is a premier international mixed martial arts (MMA) organization based in Spring Lake, Michigan, with offices throughout the United States and South America. The XFC showcases both male and female fighters, advocates young MMA fighters, and produces stadium fight cards in various locations in the United States and South America, including Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Brazil, São Paulo, Campinas, and Araraquara. It is often confused with EFC Worldwide.\n\nThroughout 2008-2012, the XFC hosted 4–6 events per year, travelling around the USA and Greece. In 2013, the company announced its new executive team, as well as a broadcast partnership with an open broadcaster in South America, Rede TV!. This began the International Tournament & Super-Fight Series. The unprecedented success of the 2014 Season I Series allowed the XFC to secure various partnerships with various global broadcasters, including Terra TV, HBO America, and UOL. The XFC currently features more than 125 MMA fighters from 23 countries.\n\nThe organization's first stadium event was called XFC 1: Dynamite and was staged at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida on November 11, 2007. The show officially drew over 11,000 MMA fans, tripling the former record for attendance at an MMA event in the state of Florida. However, XFC president John Prisco claims that the actual attendance number was closer to 13,000.\n\nThe XFC returned to the St. Pete Times forum on March 2, 2008, with a show called XFC 2: Rage in the Cage. Among the celebrities in attendance was former professional wrestling star Hulk Hogan, who watched his nephew David Bollea win his professional debut on the XFC undercard. Bollea had issued a to boxer-versus-MMA fighter challenge to boxing champion Floyd Mayweather leading up to his fight.\n\nThe company's third event was its first show staged outside of Florida, taking place at the Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky and drew 6,000 fans on Saturday, June 7; a small riot broke out after the main event, when local favorite Benny Stanley was choked out by Scott Porter in 13 seconds, leading to one arrest. Another known local Brad Chamberlain won via KO in the first round. WNKY, Lexington's NBC News affiliate, reported that XFC set the Kentucky statewide record for MMA attendance with the promotion.\n\n XFC 4: Judgement in the Cage \nreturned to the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa on June 28, 2008 and drew over 10,700 fans, at the time the second largest crowd for an MMA promotion in Florida history.—trailing only XFC's first Dynamite for the overall Florida attendance record. John \"Mulatto Mauler\" Mahlow defeated Eben \"The Big O\" Oroz by unanimous decision for the XFC lightweight title in the main event, and in the undercard, the much-heralded Matt Juncal—a three-time high school state wrestling champion from nearby Brandon, Florida and a former college All-American wrestler—made his MMA debut, defeating the also-debuting Jeff Mansir by submission in the first round.\n\nThe main event of XFC's fifth show, XFC 5: Return of the Giant, which took place on September 13, 2008 at the St. Pete Times Forum, featured the MMA comeback of Gan McGee. McGee, who stands six-foot, 10-inches tall and is known as \"The Giant,\" had last fought on American soil during a UFC Pay-Per-View, when he battled heavyweight champion Tim Sylvia for UFC's world title. The fight ended up being highly controversial; Sylvia defeated McGee, but tested positive for steroids in a post-fight drug test. Sylvia was suspended by the Nevada Boxing Commission for six-months and was stripped of his title, but McGee was never granted a rematch, nor was the loss expunged from his record. McGee faced Johnathan Ivey, a 250-pound brawler who stated that McGee \"should've stayed retired.\"\n\nIvey failed to deliver on his pre-fight promise: a record-setting 11,200 fans watched McGee defeat Ivey by second-round knockout.\n\nOn December 5, 2008, XFC closed out the year with its sixth promotion, XFC 6: Clash of the Continents, returning once again to the St. Pete Times Forum. The show featured a heavyweight showdown in the main event, with the top-ranked heavyweight in Africa, South African heavyweight champion Rico Hattingh, against undefeated American heavyweight Chad Corvin. Also on the card was the MMA debut of four-time world female boxing champion of Chevelle Hallback, in the XFC's first-ever female cage fight.\n\nHallback won by TKO in the first round, and Corvin beat Hattingh, knocking out the South African heavyweight champion.\n\nAmong the celebrities in attendance were Linda Hogan, her young boyfriend, and her son Nick Hogan. When the three were introduced to the crowd, the audience booed loudly. Video of the Hogans getting booed at the XFC event aired on E!, TMZ, and celebrity websites like Perez Hilton.\n\nXFC made history on February 20, 2009 when it produced the first-ever professional MMA show in Tennessee state history; the Tennessee state legislature had legalized MMA only months earlier. At XFC 7: School of Hard Knox, former University of Tennessee football player Ovince St. Preux knocked out CT Turner with a kick to the head and Chad Corvin stayed undefeated by stopping the then-6-0 Scott Barrett in the first round.\n\nThe XFC's first televised fight card featured XFC 8 in Knoxville, Tennessee on April 25, 2009. Jarrod Card defeated Bruce Connors by unanimous decision in the main event of the evening to claim the XFC featherweight title. Light heavyweight prospect Ovince St. Preux, who has gone on to compete in Strikeforce, submitted his opponent, Ombey Mobley, via calf slicer.\n\nXFC 9 was held in Tampa Bay on September 5, 2009. The card was headlined by a fight between Jon Koppenhaver and Florida native Mikey Gomez. Koppenhaver won the bout via technical knockout early in the third round.\n\nRemaining in Tampa Bay, XFC hosted their tenth event on March 19, 2010. Jarrod Card submitted Jason Wood with a rear naked choke to retain the XFC featherweight title in the feature bout. Junior Assuncao caught John Mahlow in a guillotine choke in the first round of their bout to capture the XFC lightweight title.\n\nTampa Bay saw the eleventh XFC event on July 9, 2010. In the feature bout, Micah Miller knocked out former top ranked Florida featherweight Bruce Connors inside of one round. Miller connected with a knee from the Thai plum and threw a flurry of punches, ending with a left jab.\n\nXFC 12 took place on October 10, 2010 a non sanctioned bout in Kyrenia, Cyprus. In the feature bout, XFC Featherweight Champion Jarrod Card submitted Tony Hervey with a rear naked choke in a 150 lb. catchweight bout. Meanwhile, highly ranked welterweight prospect Joe Ray stopped Gerardo Julio Gallegos in the first round do to a cut over the eye in their bout.\n\nXFC returned to Tampa Bay for their thirteenth event, which occurred on December 3, 2010. A featherweight title bout between Jarrod Card and Luis Palomino headlined the card. The bout went all five rounds, with Palomino winning a unanimous decision. Chris Barnett defeated Mario Rinaldi by TKO in the second round of their bout, while prospect Joe Ray dropped a split decision to South African Jeremy Smith.\n\nOct. 21, 2011\n\nTook place on Dec. 2, 2011 in Tampa, Florida at the St. Pete Times Forum\n\nMAIN CARD (HDNet)\n\nTook place on Feb. 10, 2012 in Knoxville, TN\n\nMAIN CARD (HDNet)\n\nTook place on April 13, 2012 in Jackson, Tennessee\n\nMAIN CARD (HDNet)\n\nPRELIMINARY CARD:\nTook place in Nashville, TN on Friday June 22, 2012\n\nMAIN CARD (AXStv):\n\nPRELIMINARY CARD:\n\nTook place on Aug 03, 2012 in Charlotte, North Carolina, at the Grady Cole Center\n\nMAIN CARD (AXS TV) \nPRELIMINARY CARD (Untelevised) \n\nTook place on Sept 28, 2012 in Knoxville, Tennessee at the Knoxville Civic Auditorium.\n\nMAIN CARD\n\nPreliminary Bouts:\n\nTook place on Dec. 7, 2012 in Nashville, Tennessee at the Nashville Municipal Auditorium.\n\nMAIN CARD (AXS TV)\n\nPRELIMINARY CARD\n\nTook place on Feb. 22, 2013 in Charlotte, North Carolina at the Grady Cole Center.\n\nMAIN CARD (AXS TV)\n\nPRELIMINARY CARD \n\nTook place on April 19, 2013 in Louisville, Kentucky at the Kentucky International Convention Centre.\n\nMAIN CARD (AXS TV)\n\nPRELIMINARY CARD\n\nAMATEUR CARD\n\nTook place on June 14, 2013 in Tampa, Florida, USA\n\n\nTook place on September 6, 2013 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA\n\n\nTook place on October 18, 2013 in Nashville, Tennessee, USA\n\nTook place on December 13, 2013 in Muskegon, Michigan, USA\n\nTook place on Feb. 8, 2014 in São Paulo, Brazil\n\nTook place on Mar. 15, 2014 in São Paulo, Brazil\n\nTook place on Mar. 29, 2014 in São Paulo, Brazil\n\nTook place on Apr. 26, 2014 in São Paulo, Brazil\n\nTook place on June 7, 2014 in São Paulo, Brazil\n\nTook place on September 27, 2014 in Araraquara, Brazil\n\nTook place on November 1, 2014 in São Paulo, Brazil\n\ntook place on December 13, 2014 in Clube Concordia - Campinas, Brazil\n\nwill take place on March 14, 2015 in São Paulo, Brazil\n\nwill take place on July 4, 2015 in São Paulo, Brazil\n\ntook place on September 19, 2015 in São Paulo, Brazil\n\ntook place on November 28, 2015 in São Paulo, Brazil\n\ntook place on December 5, 2015 in São Paulo, Brazil\n\ntook place on May 28, 2016 in São Paulo, Brazil - CANCELLED\n\n\n"}
