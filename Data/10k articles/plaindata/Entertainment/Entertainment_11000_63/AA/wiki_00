{"id": "29292470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29292470", "title": "Aberri Eguna", "text": "Aberri Eguna\n\nAberri Eguna (\"Fatherland Day\") is a holiday coinciding with Easter Sunday which has its roots in the Basque nationalist movement. It was first organised by the Basque Nationalist Party on 27 March 1932 in Bilbao, then consisting of a demonstration of some 65,000 participants which terminted at the Sabino Arana House. It has since become the unofficial Basque national holiday.\n\n\"Aberri\" is a neologism coined by Sabino Arana based on the suffix \"-ba\" which occurs in numerous kinship terms (e.g. \"osaba\" \"uncle\", \"izeba\" \"aunt\", \"arreba\" \"sister of a man\" etc.) from which he fancifully deduced a putative root *aba \"father\". He formed numerous neologisms based on this putative word such as \"aberri\" (*aba + \"herri\" \"land, people, country, settlement\"), \"abizen\" \"surname\" (*aba + \"izen\" \"name\") or \"abenda\" \"race\" (*aba + \"enda\" \"lineage\"). From \"aberri\" he then went on the coin \"abertzale\" \"patriot\" (\"aberri\" \"fatherland\" + \"-(t)zale\", a suffix denoting someone keen on something). In spite of their fanciful derivation, \"aberri\" and \"abertzale\" have found their way into general usage.\n\nThe first Aberri Eguna was held to celebrate the anniversary of the concept of political Basque nationalism as put forward by Sabino Arana in 1882, according to his own writings. Some claims suggest that the date was established after Arana's death. However, its coinciding with Easter is deliberate as it follows the motto of the Basque Nationalist Party \"Jaungoiko eta Lege Zaharrak\" \"God and the Old Laws and the symbolism of the resurrection of Christ. Ideologically, it follows the examples of the older Catalan and Galician patriotic holidays, the National Day of Catalonia (from 1889 onwards) and the National Day of Galicia (from 1919 onwards). It was then celebrated in San Sebastián in 1933, in Vitoria-Gasteiz in 1934 and in Pamplona in 1935. \n\nFrom 1936 onwards, the year of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, it was no longer celebrated in a single location but instead in various localities on a smaller scale and under clandestine conditions as under Franco, Aberri Eguna was forbidden from 1937 to 1975. It was only freely celebrated in the Northern Basque Country under the auspices of the Basque Government in Exile.\n\nThe Aberri Eguna is not an official holiday and main events continue to be organized by Basque nationalist parties. However, the exact format and tone depends on the organiser and thus can vary considerably from a political rally to a cultural picnic. In particular in emigrant communities, the celebration of Basque culture features much more strongly than any political overtones. The cultural element often features events such as Basque music, traditional sports, food and drink, in particular Basque cider.\n\n\n\n \n"}

After the dissolution, the name Atlus continued as a brand used by Index Corporation for video game publishing until 2013. Atlus in its current incarnation was founded as Sega Dream Corporation in September 2013, a new shell corporation established by Sega. In November 2013, Sega Dream was renamed Index Corporation, following the bankruptcy of the original Index Corporation. In April 2014, Sega implemented a corporate spin-off in which the contents and solution businesses of Index were spun off as Index Corporation, while the rest of Index Corporation (formerly Sega Dream) was renamed Atlus.\n\nThe company has two internal divisions, P-Studio, responsible for managing the \"Persona\" series, and Studio Zero, which was established in 2016 by many former members of P-Studio. A North American branch of the company, Atlus USA was founded in 1991 in order to focus on publishing and localizing games for North America. Until 2017, Atlus did not have an office for publishing in PAL regions, resulting in the company partnering with multiple third-party publishers instead, such as Ghostlight, NIS America, Square Enix, and Deep Silver.\n\nAtlus began in April 7, 1986 as a video game developer of computer games for other companies. In January 1987, Atlus started selling amusement equipment. It expanded into the sale of karaoke equipment in March 1989. Atlus released the first video game under its own name in 1989: \"Puzzle Boy\" for the Game Boy.\n\nAtlus started in the arcade industry in the 1990s by manufacturing its first arcade video game, \"BlaZeon\", in 1992. In 1995, Atlus launched Print Club Arcades in partnership with Sega. Atlus entered the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1997, listing on the JASDAQ. In its goal to further increase its presence in the amusement industry, Atlus acquired the manufacturer Apies from Yubis Corporation in 1999. In 2000, Atlus formed a joint venture with Kadokawa Shoten to distribute and sell games. Atlus suffered from deficit financial results in both 1999 and 2000. To address the issue, Atlus established a management reform plan in 2001. In its restructuring efforts, Atlus sold two subsidiaries (one of them being Apies) to their respective employees as part of a management buyout.\n\nOn October 2001, Atlus acquired Career Soft, and became the sole publisher of the \"Growlanser\" series: a real-time strategy role-playing game from the creators of the \"Langrisser\" series. In 2004, after the release of \"Growlanser IV\", the majority of Career Soft's staff was merged into the main development team of Atlus where they worked on the \"\" games. As a developer brand, Career Soft was eventually dissolved.\n\nOn October 2003, Japanese toy company Takara acquired Atlus. On 21 November 2006 Index Holdings announced the acquisition of Atlus, effective on 30 October, and purchased 7.7 million shares (54.93 percent; 77,000 votes, or 54.96 percent of the voting rights) on 20 November 2006. Atlus became an Index Holdings subsidiary on 29 November 2006.\n\nOn March 2009, Atlus and Sting Entertainment announced a publishing partnership making Atlus the only publisher of Sting-developed games in Japan. On 17 September 2009, Index Holdings announced the separation of Atlus' amusement facility and related business into a subsidiary, New Entertainment Waves, effective on 1 December. One hundred seventy-two shares of the subsidiary's stock were also transferred to Chushoukigyou Leisure on 1 December.\n\nOn 30 August 2010, Index Holdings announced its merger with Atlus, with Index Holdings being the surviving company, effective on 1 October. After the merger, Index Holdings would continue to operate the Atlus brand. Although fans were concerned about the company's future, CEO Shinichi Suzuki said that Atlus would continue to provide the \"finest quality game experiences possible\" and the merger \"further strengthens the foundation of Atlus, both in Japan and here in the United States.\" On 9 November 2010 Index Holdings announced its renaming to Index Corporation, to be confirmed at the shareholders meeting on 25 November 2010 and effective on 1 December.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2013, Atlus, as a company, ceased to exist and its name became a brand of Index Corporation for video games in Japan. However, Atlus USA remained active and was renamed Index Digital Media, serving as the North American subsidiary for Index Corporation. Much like in Japan, video games continued to be released in that region under the Atlus name during this period. In June 2013, it was reported that Index Corporation filed for civil rehabilitation proceedings, facing bankruptcy with debts of ¥24.5 billion. An Atlus USA spokesperson said that Index Digital Media and the Atlus brand were unaffected by the proceedings.\n\nOn 18 September 2013, it was reported that Sega Sammy Holdings won a bid to acquire the bankrupt Index for ¥14 billion. All Index operations, including the Atlus brand and Index Digital Media (Atlus USA), were transferred to Sega Dream Corporation (a new subsidiary of Sega Corporation) on 1 November 2013. That day, Sega announced that it would change the name of Sega Dream Corporation to Index Corporation.\n\nOn 18 February 2014, Sega announced the separation of Index Corporation's contents and solution businesses into a new subsidiary, Index Corporation, renaming the old Index Corporation and its remaining digital game business division to Atlus effective 1 April 2014. The new Atlus would include the foreign subsidiary, Index Digital Media, which would revert its name back to Atlus USA at the establishment of the new Atlus.\n\nIn April 2017, Sega Sammy Holdings announced a relocation of head office functions of the Sega Sammy Group and its major domestic subsidiaries located in the Tokyo metropolitan area to Shinagawa-ku by January 2018. Their stated reasoning was to promote cooperation among companies and creation of more active interaction of personnel, while pursuing efficient group management by consolidating scattered head office functions of the group. Atlus is one of the companies that will relocate in response to this.\n\nAtlus U.S.A., Inc. established in 1991 and based in Irvine, California, is the American subsidiary of Atlus and publishes games created by Atlus and other developers. It was formally called Index Digital Media from 2010 to 2014 in response to Atlus being dissolved into Index Corporation.\n\nA number of \"Megami Tensei\" games have not been released in North America. During the 1990s, \"Jack Bros.\" for Virtual Boy, \"\" for PlayStation and \"\" for the Game Boy Color were the first three games in the series to have a North American release. The 2004 release of \"\" was the first main-series video-game release in the U.S. Since then most of the series has also been released in the U.S., including \"Persona 3\", \"\" and \"\".\n\nAtlus USA has localized cult classic \"\", created by Nippon Ichi Software. The company have also published the tactical role-playing game \"Tactics Ogre\" and Game Boy Advance remakes of the \"Kunio-kun\" and \"Double Dragon\" games for Million (a company composed of former Technōs Japan employees). Other notable titles include \"Snowboard Kids\" and \"Snowboard Kids 2\" (for Nintendo 64) and \"Odin Sphere\" and the \"Trauma Center\" series. Atlus USA released \"\", a role-playing video game for the Game Boy Advance previously released for the Wonderswan Color, in 2004 in collaboration with Sting and Bandai. In 2006 Atlus USA and Sting released \"Yggdra Union\", a strategy role-playing game (RPG) for the Game Boy Advance. After Working Designs' publication of \"Growlanser Generations\", they released \"\" in 2005 and \"Growlanser Wayfarer of Time\" in 2012.\n\nThe company established an online division, including the Atlus Online portal which is servicing \"\" and \"\". On 31 March 2013, Index Digital Media's Atlus Online Division was purchased by Marvelous AQL and transferred to XSEED Games. Atlus USA has published games under the \"Marl Kingdom\" name, beginning with \"\" in 2000.\nOn 18 February 2014 Sega announced that Index Digital Media would revert its name back to Atlus USA. In March 2016, Sega announced that all the future localized products from Atlus for North America will be published by Sega.\n\nUntil 2017, Atlus did not have a dedicated European division for publishing and distributing their titles within the European and Oceania region. Instead, many of Atlus' titles were published in these regions by Nippon Ichi Software (NIS) and its American division NIS America. Following Atlus's acquisition by Sega Sammy Holdings, NIS found that it became more difficult to work between Sega and Atlus for distribution and in April 2016, formally ended its distribution partnership with Atlus. In July 2016, Deep Silver announced that it had come to agreement to become Atlus' distributor for Europe and Oceania, and would begin to publish titles in both retail and digital form. In August 2017, Atlus announced that they had opened a European distribution team located in Sega Europe's offices in London that would publish all its titles going forward.\n\nJack Frost, who appears as a demon in the \"Shin Megami Tensei\" franchise, is the company mascot. Resembling a snowman, he has teeth, a tail and no nose, and wears a jester hat, collar, and shoes. His catchphrase is \"Hee-Ho\". He has appeared in several games in the \"Shin Megami Tensei\" series, as well as the \"Jack Bros.\" games. Jack Frost is a hidden character in the North American and Japanese versions of \"\", with a larger role in the Japanese version.

It was the first game designed by Cartwright. The idea for \"Barnstorming\" came to him as he watched a biplane one day while driving home from work.\n\nThe player must pilot a biplane through a series of barns in the shortest time possible while dodging windmills, weather vanes, and geese. Bumping into anything slows down the plane for a couple of seconds, increasing the overall time.\n\nThere are four levels of play determined by the game select switch. Game 1 is \"Hedge Hopper\" (10 barns), game 2 is \"Crop Duster\" (15 barns), game 3 is \"Stunt Pilot\" (15 barns), and game 4 is \"Flying Ace\" (25 barns). In the first three games, the course layout of barns, windmills, and even geese do not change, making it easy to memorize the layout. Game 4 is the only game with a random course.\n\nOriginally, a player with a time or better of 33.3 seconds on game 1, 51.0 seconds on game 2, or 54.0 seconds on game 3 could send Activision a picture of their screen and receive membership in the Activision Flying Aces and receive a Flying Aces patch.\n\nRichard A.

The film serves as a spin-off of the \"Barbershop\" film franchise, and stars Queen Latifah as Gina, a character first introduced in the 2004 film \"\". This film also stars Alicia Silverstone, Andie MacDowell, Mena Suvari, Kevin Bacon and Djimon Hounsou.\n\nGina Norris (Queen Latifah) is a widowed hairstylist who has moved from Chicago to Atlanta so her daughter Vanessa (Paige Hurd) can attend a private music school. She's made a name for herself as a stylist, but after her self-centered boss, Jorge (Kevin Bacon), criticizes her decisions, she leaves and sets up her own shop, purchasing a run-down salon by the skin of her teeth by helping out a loan officer.\n\nUpon buying the salon, she runs into instant barriers: loudmouthed young stylists, older clients who are fixed in their habits, an energetic young boy named Willie (Lil' JJ) who constantly flirts with women (including Vanessa) while filming for his next music video, people wary of her ability as a hairdresser, and the constant trouble her rebellious sister-in-law, Darnelle (Keshia Knight Pulliam), finds herself in. Gina issues an ultimatum with Darnelle to clean up her act and start paying her back or she will be evicted. In a short time, the previous owner's clients become her own and many of her former customers find their way from Jorge's to her salon. When electrical issues arise, she finds that the upstairs renter, Joe, is a handsome electrician from Africa who eventually bonds with Vanessa due to his skills on the piano. Because Jorge is jealous that his shop is losing clients to Gina's, he pays a health inspector named Crawford (Jim Holmes), to find various ways to shut down Gina's business.\n\nOver time, neighborhood regulars frequent the shop and the varied stylists become close to Gina, as does Joe (Djimon Hounsou). One of her former clients from Jorge's even uses her connections to set up a meeting with Cover Girl for Gina's homemade miracle conditioner, affectionately called \"hair crack\".\n\nTragedy strikes when the shop is trashed and heavily vandalized the night before Vanessa's big piano recital. When Gina next enters the shop, she finds not only that her staff has cleaned up the majority of the mess and brought items from home so the shop could operate, but Darnelle has also decided to grow up and enter beauty school. While filming for his next topic, Willie tapes a meeting between Jorge and Inspector Crawford and learns that they were responsible for trying to ruin Gina. Shortly, a disheveled woman enters the shop and begs for someone to fix her hair for a wedding she has in a few hours. Soon after, Willie shows Gina the videotape of a meeting he filmed of Jorge and Inspector Crawford. Later that night, Gina goes to Jorge's salon to not only tell him about the tape, but that she knows he is not Jorge from Austria, but George Christie from Nebraska. As soon as Gina leaves, James (Bryce Wilson) (Gina's only male employee) and a few of his friends give Jorge an extreme haircut as payback for what he did to her in trying to close her shop.\n\nLater, as the shop listens to their favorite radio talk-show host DJ Hollerin' Helen (Adele Givens), they find out she was the desperate customer on the way to the wedding as she gives the shop (and Gina's \"hair crack\" conditioner) a shout-out on the radio.\n\n\n\nReviews for the film were mixed; it earned a 37% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from critics, with the consensus being that the film itself was not the equal of Queen Latifah's strong performance. At Metacritic, the film has averaged a 53 rating from 28 critics. Allmovie gave the film 3/5 stars, with reviewer Derek Armstrong saying that while the film sticks to the same formula which made the \"Barbershop\" films so successful, it still \"bursts with life, having attracted a spectrum of enthusiastic performers and a script that exceeds broad character types.\"\n\n2005 BET Comedy Awards\n\n2005 Black Movie Awards\n\n2005 Teen Choice Awards\n\n2006 Black Reel Awards\n\n2006 NAACP Image Awards\n\nThe film was released on DVD and VHS on August 23rd, 2005.

Early television appearances included BBC 1's \"Pebble Mill at One\" and \"Daytime Live\" (1988) and ITV's \"The James Whale Show\" (1990); Lady Crabtree has broadcast on radio and television worldwide, most recently in February 2008 when she was one of Dame Margot Hamilton's guests on BBC Three's \"Upstaged\" series and in 2013 when interviewed on the \"Scott Spears Now\" show for American television following the birth of Prince George of Cambridge. 2018 will mark Lady Crabtree's 40th anniversary in public life.\n\nLady Crabtree is the author of two books:\"The Secret Journals of Queen Elizabeth II\" (Columbus 1988 and Virgin Books 1990) and \"The Secret Royal Love Letters\" (Virgin Books 1990).\n\nBorn Constance May Rose Battersby in Warrior Square Gardens, St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, on 1 May 1948; her twin sister Millicent was delivered shortly afterwards. This was not only a shock to their mother - who had not realised that she was pregnant - but even more of a surprise to people strolling through the Square. With parents in the theatre,(performing as the variety act \"The Gay Goslings\") the girls travelled widely throughout their childhood, and attended various schools for short periods. Constance completed her education at \"Madame Bernice's Academy of Refinement and Beauty\" in Gripe Street, London. \n\nShe met her husband-to-be, the Hon Claude Crabtree, in the Assembly Rooms, York, during her twenty-first birthday ball. After a whirlwind romance, they were married on 1 July 1969 in the gloomy village church of King Herod the Great on the Crabtree family estate at Cleghorn St Percy, North Yorkshire. The couple later had twin sons,Giles and Miles. When Claude's father (Montfort, 8th Baron Crabtree) died on 7 June 1977, at the age of 104, Claude inherited the Barony and Constance became Lady Crabtree. If he had died just a day earlier, Lady Crabtree would not have been deprived of a seat at the Queen's Silver Jubilee Service in St Paul's Cathedral and she harbours a suspicion that he lingered deliberately just to spite her.\n\nAs a full-fledged member of the aristocracy, in 1978 her public life began in earnest, particularly in connection with Lord Crabtree's role as Chairman of the Mid-Yorkshire Swine Breeders' Federation - the Crabtrees owning some of the largest sites in Yorkshire. A highlight of her early married life was entertaining Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh at a Swine Breeders' dinner at Crabtree Hall, which greatly improved Lady C's standing as a society hostess. Continuing her family's interest in the theatre (\"she had herself appeared as a chorus girl in her teenage years at the Theatre Royal in York\") Lady Crabtree became Patron of the Cleghorn Local Amateur Players (\"The CLAP\"), a role she still endures to this day.\n\nAfter Claude's death in 1984 (\"Face down in the bombe-surprise at a dinner party.\") and left with astronomical death duties plus her husband's gambling debts, the Dowager Lady Crabtree found herself financially embarrassed. Taking pity on her situation, the Queen offered her the post of Relief-Woman of the Bedchamber within the Royal Household. After publishing extracts from the Queen's diaries and letters in the misguided belief that she was doing Her Majesty a favour, Lady Crabtree unexpectedly found that her services were no longer required. In 2005 she became a Reserve-Lady in Waiting to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nNow residing in Eastbourne, where she divides her time between a sea front hotel and a Home for Gentlewomen Living in Reduced Circumstances, Lady Crabtree continues to fulfil an active public life, presenting prizes, speaking at lunches and dinners, making personal appearances, and enjoys acting as compere at numerous functions, frequently regaling audiences with memories of her life with the Royal Family. She speaks at many events each year, is the doyen of Ladies' Lunch Clubs. With humour ideally suited to the over-fifties, current talks include \"How To Grown Old Disgracefully\" and \"Glad To Be Grey\" In 2018 Lady Crabtree will celebrate 40 years in public life.\n\nhttp://www.ladycrabtree.co.uk\n\nLady Crabtree is formally known as \"Constance, Lady Crabtree\", and in widowhood can also be referred to as \"The Dowager Lady Crabtree\". She should not be called \"Lady Constance\", and would only be addressed in this form had she been born the daughter of an Earl, a Marquess or a Duke.\n\n"}
{"id": "23392020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23392020", "title": "Cultural impact of The Colbert Report", "text": "Cultural impact of The Colbert Report\n\n\"The Colbert Report\", which premiered in American cable television on October 17, 2005, has had a massive cultural impact since its inception, when the show introduced the word \"truthiness\". Issues in and references to American and world culture are attributed to the character played by Stephen Colbert, who calls his followers the Colbert Nation. \"The Colbert Report\" is a late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News' \"The O'Reilly Factor\". \"The Colbert Report\" is a spin-off of Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\", where he acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character.\n\nThe program was created by Colbert, Jon Stewart, and Ben Karlin. The show's writing was grounded in improvisation, and often lampooned current events stories. The show's structure also included a guest interview, in which the Colbert character attempts to deconstruct his opponent's argument. The show was taped in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, and the program's set is \"hyper-American,\" epitomizing the character's ego. The show was taped and broadcast Monday through Thursday, with weeks taken off at multiple points in a given year for breaks. \"The Colbert Report\" saw immediate critical and ratings successes, leading to various awards, including two prestigious Peabody Awards. The show's cultural influence—which occasionally would require a fair degree of participation from the show’s audience, dubbed the \"Colbert Nation\"—extended beyond the program a number of times. This impact included the character running for U.S. President twice, co-hosting a rally at the National Mall, presenting a controversial performance at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, and establishing a real Super PAC that raised a million dollars. In addition, the show inspired various forms of multimedia, including music and multiple best-selling books.\n\nIn May 2006, the Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust posted a video of \"The Colbert Report\" on its website and sent out a mass email urging DeLay supporters to watch how \"Hollywood liberal\" Robert Greenwald \"crashed and burned . . . when promoting his new attack on Tom DeLay.\" The video featured Colbert asking questions such as, \"Who hates America more, you or Michael Moore?\" The Trust's email describes its content as \"the truth behind Liberal Hollywood's\" , and characterizes the \"Colbert Report\" clip with the headline, \"Colbert Cracks the Story on Real Motivations Behind the Movie.\" On June 8, 2006, Colbert responded by conducting an \"Exclusive Fake Interview\" on his show with DeLay. Three different interviews with DeLay on different networks were spliced for humorous effect, and Colbert ended the \"interview\" by saying \"I do hope you enjoyed my manipulation of your words.\" DeLay has since appeared as a guest on the program.\n\nOn July 25, 2006, Colbert responded to television networks—specifically Fox News, NBC's \"The Today Show\" and ABC's \"Good Morning America\"—which took comments made by Florida Congressman Robert Wexler on \"The Colbert Report\" out of context (e.g.: \"I enjoy cocaine and the company of prostitutes because they are a fun thing to do.\"). Wexler, who ran unopposed in the then-upcoming election, made the comments in response to urging by Colbert that he \"say some things that would really lose the election for [Wexler] if [Wexler] were contested.\" Colbert criticized the major networks' morning news shows that featured the interview in a misleading and a negative light, by showing clips from many of the \"fluff\" pieces they favored instead of \"real\" news. Colbert subsequently told his viewers to \"vote Wexler, the man's got a sense of humor, unlike, evidently, journalists.\"\n\nColbert announced on his March 28, 2006 show that he had been contacted by San Francisco Zoo officials seeking his permission to name an unhatched bald eagle after him. The eagle, affectionately dubbed Stephen Jr. on \"The Report\", was bred to be reintroduced into the wild, as a part of the zoo's California Bald Eagle Breeding Program. Colbert celebrated the chick's birth on the April 17, 2006, program, and has since given updates on the bird's development. He has criticized the bird for migrating to Canada, and has attempted to lure him back to the U.S. On December 24, 2008, Stephen Jr. (tag A-46) was photographed at the Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge on the California/Oregon border.\n\nOn September 30, 2006, the Saginaw Spirit, an OHL hockey team in Saginaw, Michigan, named its co-mascot Steagle Colbeagle the Eagle in honor of Colbert, despite the fact that it was spotted holding a Canadian flag during the anthem. Before the introduction of the mascot, the team record was 0–3–0–1, but once the Steagle was introduced, the team improved their record to 44–21–0–3 by the season's end, before losing in the first round of the playoffs. On January 27, 2007, Oshawa, Ontario declared March 20 of that year (John Gray's birthday) Stephen Colbert Day after mayor John Gray bet Colbert that the Oshawa Generals would beat the Spirit, and Saginaw won 5–4.\n\nIn the latter part of March 2007, Drexel University named a leatherback turtle in honor of Colbert in their Great Turtle Race. \"Stephanie Colburtle the Leatherback Turtle\" came in second place, losing to a turtle named Billie.\n\nOn June 24, 2008, Dr. Jason Bond, an associate professor with the Department of Biology at East Carolina University, appeared on the show because he agreed to name a spider after Stephen Colbert. They negotiated over what kind of spider would be named after Stephen, and Colbert told the professor that they would \"settle this in the next couple of weeks\". During the interview, the visual approximation of Bond changed between different pictures depicting Spider-Man, including Tobey Maguire (the actor who played Spider-Man in the films) and costumed people/animals. The spider was officially announced on August 6 as the \"Aptostichus stephencolberti\".\n\nColbert announced on February 5, 2009 that the UC Santa Cruz Marine Lab named an elephant seal in honor of him: Stelephant Colbert the Elephant Seal.\n\nIn 2006, the ice hockey team Saginaw Spirit named their mini mascot \"Steagle Colbeagle\" after they held a naming contest. As of 2014, the team still had Steagle Colbeagle as their mini mascot.\n\nIn February 2007, Ben & Jerry's unveiled a new ice cream flavor in honor of Stephen Colbert, named Stephen Colbert's AmeriCone Dream (available only in the United States). Colbert waited until Easter to sample the ice cream because he \"gave up sweets for Lent.\" Colbert will donate all proceeds to charity through the new Stephen Colbert AmeriCone Dream Fund, which will distribute the money to various causes. The flavor is described as \"a decadent melting pot of vanilla ice cream with fudge-covered waffle cone pieces and a caramel swirl.\" The company's founders appeared on the show on March 5, 2007 to discuss the ice cream and to plug their \"grassroots education and advocacy project\", TrueMajority.\n\nOn August 22, 2007, Richard Branson, who was being interviewed as a guest, announced that one of his \"Virgin America\" aeroplanes would be named Air Colbert. Colbert announced on April 2, 2008, during a ThreatDown segment, that the plane had been grounded after one of its engines was damaged by a bird strike.\n\nDuring the sweepstakes for naming the new wing on the International Space Station, Stephen Colbert announced on his show that there was a write-in section where you could write your own suggestion for a name in. He encouraged his fans to write in \"Colbert\". When the sweepstakes was over, NASA announced that \"Colbert\" had beaten the next-most-popular choice, \"Serenity,\" by over 40,000 votes on March 11, 2009. \"Colbert\" received 230,539 votes out of nearly 1.2 million cast.\n\nOn April 15, 2009, NASA announced that instead of the new module being named after him, a treadmill on board the space station would be called the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill (C.O.L.B.E.R.T.).\n\n\"Time\" magazine's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 Returning Series of 2007, ranking it at #7.\n\nColbert has appeared on the covers of several major magazines, including \"Wired\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"Esquire\", \"Sports Illustrated\" (as sponsor of the US Speedskating team) and \"Newsweek\", in which he was the Guest Editor.\n\nOn March 12, 2007, the Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics, Joe Quesada, awarded Stephen Colbert the shield of the recently deceased superhero Captain America. The letter to Colbert accompanying the shield stated that \"the Star-Spangled Avenger has bequeathed... his indestructible shield to the only man he believed to have the red, white, and blue balls to carry the mantle.\" Colbert promised to use the shield \"only to fight for justice...and to impress girls.\" It was, in fact, one of only two full-sized prop shields which had previously been kept in the Marvel offices. On January 29, 2008, Quesada (now president of Marvel) returned to announce that Colbert's fictional campaign for the presidency was still active in the Marvel universe, references to which have appeared in Marvel comics since. Colbert appears on the cover of \"Amazing Spider-Man #573\".\n\nAt the end of 2008, \"The Colbert Report\" was named the number one television series of that year by \"Entertainment Weekly\".\n\nIn 2010 Colbert won the Golden Tweet Award.\n\nOn October 17, 2008, it was announced that the portrait of Stephen from his second year of \"The Colbert Report\" was accepted into the national portrait collection at the National Museum of American History for its November reopening.\n\nOn November 2, 2009, Colbert, representing the Colbert Nation, signed an on-air sponsorship agreement with U.S. speedskating executive director Robert Crowley. Fundraising via \"The Colbert Report\" ultimately raised $300,000 for the US Winter Olympics speedskating team. Coverage of the show's efforts also led to Colbert personally being invited to be the official ombudsman at the oval for the Olympics, appointed as the official assistant sports psychologist for the US olympics speed skating team, and as such is now an official member of the team, and invited by Dick Ebersol, to be part of NBC's 2010 Winter Olympics coverage team.\n\nIn response to the \"Better Know a District\" segment, Rahm Emanuel, then the Democratic Caucus chair, instructed incoming freshmen not to do appearances on the show.\n\n\"The Colbert Report\" has created new words. Besides \"truthiness\", Colbert has coined other terms including \"freem\", which is \"freedom without the do, because I do it all for you.\" Other words include: \"eneagled\", a blend of \"enabled\" and \"eagle\", thus meaning \"to be given the characteristics of an eagle\" and \"mantasy\", meaning male fantasies, such as running away from the wife to become free, a word to which Colbert claims to hold a trademark. In 2009, he coined the word \"engayify\" meaning \"to gay it up.\"\n\nColbert made repeated references on the show to Wikipedia, which he referred to as his favorite website, generally in \"The Wørd\" segment. Colbert's first reference to Wikipedia was during the July 31, 2006 broadcast, when \"The Word\" was Wikiality, defined as the concept that \"together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on\". The premise of wikiality is that reality is what the wiki says it is. He explained that on Wikipedia \"any user can change any entry, and if enough users agree with them, it becomes true\". He also told his viewers to edit the Wikipedia article on elephants to edit say: \"Elephant population in Africa has tripled over the past six months.\" The suggestion resulted in numerous changes to Wikipedia articles related to elephants and Africa. Editing of the articles concerned was restricted to prevent further edits. The pages' protection expiration date has been postponed several times as the vandalism ensued again.\n\nAnother Colbert neologism related to Wikipedia is \"Wikilobbying\", regarding which he stated \"when money determines Wikipedia entries, reality has become a commodity\". He alluded to a case involving controversy over whether governments should reject a Microsoft document format in favor of an independent standard, during which Microsoft allegedly hired a Linux user to edit Wikipedia to ensure neutral and factual coverage of Microsoft's version. Colbert used the term \"self-determination\" to refer to corporations being able to act out their fantasies online by editing their own Wikipedia entries. Colbert described Wikipedia as \"\"Second Life\" for corporations\", saying that if a corporation wants to pretend to be someone else online, then that is their business.\n\nIn another episode, guest Dan Zaccagnino was discussing his new wiki where readers could share their musical compositions. In an imitation of record scratching, Colbert used the term \"Wiki-Wiki-Wikipedia\".\n\nOn May 24, 2007, the guest was Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia. Stephen Colbert called Wikipedia a \"battlefield for information\", a tool which \"brings democracy to information\" and moves away from the views of the \"elite who study things and get to say what is or is not real\". During the interview, Colbert showed a sentence on the screen, \"Librarians are hiding something.\" Wales was not allowed to see it, implying that he could not personally stop a critical mass of individuals from editing a page when he did not know which page was the target. Wales responded that \"the interesting thing about \"The Colbert Report\" is that Wikipedians watch it\".\n\nOn June 9, 2008, Colbert mentioned Warren G. Harding as being a \"secret negro president\", and said that for proof, \"the G stands for Gangsta\" which he edited Wikipedia to state so that he could cite a source.\n\nIn 2006, the Ministry of Transport of Hungary launched an online call for public suggestions to name a future motorway bridge over the Danube, just north of Budapest. Ministry officials said the Hungarian Geographical Name Committee would choose from among the three submitted candidates with the most votes, guided by suggestions submitted by \"local governments, cartographers, linguists, and other experts\". Users offered hundreds of suggestions, among them the \"'You Can Go To Bratislava But Not Over This Bridge' Bridge\" and the \"Chuck Norris Bridge\", which led in votes for some time. Colbert noted the effort in his \"Tip of the hat, wag of the finger\" segment on August 9, and in the following weeks, he continued to ask viewers to vote for him. On August 22, Hungarian news sites reported Colbert had won the first round of voting with 17,231,724 votes, which is 7 million more people than there are in all of Hungary. Hungary changed the voting rules after the members of the Colbert Nation Forums developed a bot to stuff the ballot box, requiring registration to vote in the second phase. That night, Colbert asked his viewers to cease their efforts, and offered apologies, spending a segment honoring Hungary, its history, and its contributions to the world.\n\nOn September 14, 2006, Colbert introduced his guest András Simonyi, Ambassador of the Republic of Hungary to the United States. The ambassador presented Mr. Colbert with a declaration certifying him as the winner of the second and final round of voting. The document bore the signatures of Hungarian government officials and the country's official seal. Included in the text, as read by the ambassador, were two important conditions required for the name of the bridge to be made official. First, Colbert must be fluent in Hungarian. Colbert responded by pronouncing the Hungarian name \"Nicholas Zrinyi\" (incorrectly referring to Miklós Zrínyi) and \"híd\" (meaning 'bridge' in Hungarian); Simonyi quickly certified him as fluent. The second requirement proved more onerous: To have the bridge named after him, Colbert would have to be deceased. Colbert protested, but the ambassador presented him with a Hungarian passport and (HUF), noting that this would allow Colbert to enter Hungary at any time, without restriction. He also brought attention to the portrait of King St. Stephen, the first King of Hungary, on the 10,000 HUF bill. Finally Simonyi implied that the question of Colbert's ineligibility by virtue of being alive might be resolved if Colbert were to accept an invitation to visit the bridge site in Budapest; Colbert responded by trying to bribe the ambassador with the 10,000 HUF bill. On September 28, 2006, it was announced that the bridge will be named \"Megyeri Bridge\", although the name did not make it to the second round. According to the Geographical Name Committee, the name was selected because the bridge connects with Békásmegyer.\n\nColbert sometimes implicitly suggests that his fans remix various aspects of his show simply by telling them not to remix it. In January 2009, he told viewers not to remix his interview with Lawrence Lessig, founder of Creative Commons, which lets authors of creative works share them with the world. This type of fan involvement is similar to the Colbert Green Screen Challenge, which focuses on video content editing.\n\nOn October 16, 2007, Colbert announced on \"The Report\" that he would be running for president. He had chosen no vice-president, though he was considering choosing Vladimir Putin, Mike Huckabee, or himself as his running mate. Colbert declared that he was only running in South Carolina, his home state, and was contemplating running for both the Republican and Democratic parties as a \"favorite son.\" Colbert covered his story in the segment \"The Hail to the Cheese Stephen Colbert NachoCheese Doritos 2008 Presidential Campaign Coverage\" and promoted his campaign on his special election website colbert08.org, as under law he cannot use colbertnation.com.\n\nOn October 21, 2007, Colbert was interviewed by host Tim Russert on NBC's \"Meet The Press\". Colbert explained why he changed the pronunciation of his name (from \"COLE-Bert\" to \"Cole-BEAR\"), demanded to know whether Russert believes that God supports our enemies in Iraq and revealed that he had no interest in \"winning\" the Presidency (he just wanted to run).\n\nOn November 1, 2007, the executive council of the South Carolina Democratic Party voted 13-3 to keep his name off the ballot and refunded his US$2500 filing fee. By November 5, 2007, Colbert had officially dropped his Presidential bid.\n\nOn the July 21, 2008, episode of \"The Colbert Report\", Colbert made a comment about John McCain making a campaign stop in Canton, Ohio, and \"not the crappy Canton in Georgia.\" The comment resulted in a local uproar, with the Canton, Georgia mayor insisting Colbert had never visited the town along with an invitation for him to do so.\n\nOn July 30, 2008, Colbert apologized for the story, insisting that he was incorrect and that the real crappy Canton was Canton, Kansas, after which he made several jokes at the Kansas town's expense including calling the town a \"shit hole\". Reaction from Mayor Brad Smiley and local residents was negative, while Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius invited Colbert to spend a night in Canton's historic jail.\n\nOn August 5, 2008, Colbert apologized to the citizens of Canton, Kansas, he then maintained that he had meant to direct his mock derision towards Canton, South Dakota, by calling it \"North Dakota's dirty ashtray\" and satirizing the town in song.\n\nOn August 12, 2008, Colbert once again apologized to his latest comedic target even though local reaction to the insult was fairly mild. Referring to a line from his satirical song, Colbert said that not all the dogs run away from Canton, South Dakota but \"some stay and develop a drinking problem.\" However, as with the previous apologies, he began a new tirade on another Canton. According to Colbert, Canton, Texas is nothing but an \"incorporated outhouse\" and \"one steaming pile of longhorn dung.\" He then asked the audience if they'd seen the town's tourism video. A video then promptly followed showing a monkey humping another monkey with the words Canton, Texas placed in the corner and an arrow pointing from the name to the monkey on bottom. This jab at the Texas town had been predicted by Governor Sebelius at the end of her July 31, 2008, remarks. In response to Colbert's comments, a Canton, Texas city councilman joked that he wanted Colbert to come there so he could \"mash his nose\".\n\nOn October 28, 2008, Colbert reacted to the news that Barack Obama was campaigning for president in Canton, Ohio — the original good Canton — by saying that he was forced to admit that Canton, Ohio in fact was the \"real\" crappy Canton all along.\n\nThe \"Colbert Bump\" is defined, connotatively by the \"Report\", as an increase in popularity of a person (author, musician, politician, etc.) or thing (website, etc.) as a result of appearing as a guest on or (in the case of a thing) being mentioned on the show. For example, if a politician appears on \"The Colbert Report\", they may become more popular with certain voters and thus are more likely to be elected. According to a study by James H. Fowler, contributions to Democratic politicians rose 40% for 30 days after an appearance on the show. The Mozilla Foundation also experienced a noticeable spike in the download rates of the Firefox browser right after the launch of Firefox 3 was mentioned in the program. Magazines such as \"GQ\", \"Newsweek\" and \"Sports Illustrated\" have all had sales spikes when Colbert appeared on their covers.\n\nA cocktail called the \"Colbert Bump\" was designed during the August 4th, 2009, episode of \"The Colbert Report\" by author David Wondrich. The recipe for a Colbert Bump includes one ounce of Cherry Heering liqueur, one and a half ounces of gin, a quarter of an ounce of lemon juice, and a little soda water.\n\nIn March 2009, NASA ran an online contest to name the new node of the International Space Station. Colbert encouraged his viewers to write in his name. By the end, 230,539 \"Colbert\" votes were cast. This beat \"Serenity\", the top NASA choice, by more than 40,000 votes.\nOn April 14, 2009, Astronaut \"Suni\" Sunita Williams appeared on \"The Colbert Report\", and announced the name of the node to be \"Tranquility.\" However, the treadmill the astronauts use to work out on will be named \"C.O.L.B.E.R.T.\" for \"Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill\" and this will be located in \"Tranquility.\"\n\nThe Mars Society temporarily renamed their Mars Desert Research Station “Colbert” for one week in April, citing the likelihood that Node 3 would not be given that name in a press release.\n\nOn March 17, 2009, Colbert announced that the show would be broadcasting from somewhere in The Persian Gulf at some future date. He did not reveal where and when the taping would occur, as that would have presented a security breach. As part of this he made a segment called \"Where in the world and when in time is Stephen Colbert gonna be in the Gulf?\" In it he offered vague clues to the location via a \"Press Your Luck\" board, and described the location being somewhere \"sandy\" and \"packed with troops\". He repeatedly alluded to places he might go, but refused to divulge specific details. On the May 4 show, director and writer J. J. Abrams (\"LOST,\" \"Alias,\" Cloverfield,\" and \"Star Trek\") appeared as a guest, and revealed that he had found out where Colbert was headed and had hidden clues to the location throughout the broadcast, leaving it to the viewers to decipher their meaning. On June 5, 2009, Colbert officially announced that \"Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando\" would be taping and performing shows in Iraq from June 8 to June 11, 2009, making \"The Colbert Report\" the first TV show in USO history to produce a week of shows in a combat zone. The shows were filmed at Camp Victory in the Al-Faw Palace.\n\nColbert's head was shaved on stage by General Raymond T. Odierno, Commander of the Multinational Force - Iraq, at the videotaped order given by President Barack Obama during the first of four taped performances that were aired June 8, 2009 through June 11, 2009. He wore a civilian two-piece suit, but with a twist: it was tailored from the United States Army's UCP digital camouflage pattern and featured an American flag and Private rank insignias on the sleeves. Vice President Joe Biden and Senators John McCain and Jim Webb made special appearances, as did former GOP Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin and former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush. Actor Tom Hanks was also featured heavily in a pre-recorded segment encouraging viewers to support care packages for the troops. At the start of all four episodes filmed in Iraq, Stephen Colbert carried a golf club on stage to honor Bob Hope's decades-long service, 250 years according to Colbert, for the USO across the world.\n\nOn November 2, 2009, Colbert, representing the Colbert Nation, signed a sponsorship agreement on-air with U.S. speedskating executive director Robert Crowley after learning of the loss of the team's prominent sponsor: Dutch bank DSB. The specifics of this sponsorship are unclear. The change of the logo of the U.S. speed skating team's cap, from DSB to Colbert Nation was later shown in the November 12 episode and further episodes. Colbert has also taken aim at Canada, mocking and insulting them, claiming they weren't giving the speed skaters adequate ice time at Olympic rink in Vancouver in preparation for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The city of Richmond, where the Olympic Oval is located, had responded with a letter inviting him to be the official ombudsman at the oval for the Olympics, under the condition that he wear the official ombudsman headgear (a pink tuque) at all times.\n\nAs a result, Stephen attempted to make the US Olympic team in various sports including speedskating in which the final spot would be his if he were to beat Shani Davis in a 500m race. He lost, but became the Assistant Sport Psychologist to the US Speedskating team (Colbert holds an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts). This perk also ensured that he would be able to be a journalist covering the 2010 Winter Olympics on his own show, and NBC where he filed speedskating reports during their primetime telecasts with Bob Costas as host. Conversely, Colbert would also feature NBC hosts and reporters covering the Olympics in his coverage of the games, alongside Olympic athletes, many of whom were from the US Speedskating team.\n\nBenjamin Creme, self-proclaimed esotericist, and owner of Share International magazine, identified the coming \"Messiah/Maitreya (or future Buddha)\" as having been: born in 1972; traveled to London from India in 1977; been dark-skinned, and having a stutter. Shortly after Raj Patel, the author of the recent book, \"The Value of Nothing\" appeared on the show, Creme stated the Messiah had appeared on a popular television program in the United States. Patel was identified as such messiah by Creme's followers, as he fulfilled all of Creme's previous predictions. In the March 15, 2010 show, Colbert claimed this was product of a \"Colbert Bump\" and called Patel on the telephone to confirm his status as the deity, which the author denied. However, Benjamin Creme had also predicted that the Messiah would deny his status, reinforcing his followers' belief in Patel's divine status.\n\nQueen Noor of Jordan appeared on \"The Colbert Report\" to promote Global Zero, an international, non-partisan, initiative to achieve phased, binding, and verifiable elimination of nuclear weapons. Colbert signed the Global Zero declaration during the interview.\n\nStephen Colbert gave a satirical speech at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in which he criticized the Bush Administration and the news media. The performance earned him praise and scorn in the media.\n\nOn September 24, 2010, Colbert testified in character before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Security. He was invited by committee chairwoman Zoe Lofgren to describe his experience participating in the United Farm Workers' \"Take Our Jobs\" program, where he spent a day working alongside migrant workers in upstate New York. At the end of his often-humorous testimony, Colbert broke character in responding to a question from Rep. Judy Chu, D-CA, and explained why he cares about the plight of migrant workers.\n\n“I like talking about people who don't have any power, and this seems like one of the least powerful people in the United States are migrant workers who come and do our work, but don't have any rights as a result. And yet we still invite them to come here and at the same time ask them to leave. And that's an interesting contradiction to me. And, you know, 'Whatsoever you do for the least of my brothers,' and these seem like the least of our brothers right now... Migrant workers suffer and have no rights. \"\n\nDemocratic committee member John Conyers questioned whether it was appropriate for the comedian to appear before Congress and asked him to leave the hearing. Though Colbert offered to depart at the direction of the committee chairwoman, Rep. Lofgren requested that he stay at least until all opening testimony had been completed, whereupon Conyers withdrew his request.\n\nConservative pundits took aim at his Congress testimony not long after.\n\n\"As John Conyers notes, the media and spectators turned out to see whether Colbert would address the panel seriously as an expert on immigration and make the panel a joke, or stay in character and make the panel a bigger joke,\" - Ed Morrissey, Hot Air.\nAfter Glenn Beck's Restoring Honor rally in Washington, D.C., a user on Reddit suggested that Colbert hold his own Restoring Truthiness rally, and a website and Facebook page for the event were set up overnight. A big announcement was first hinted at by Jon Stewart on September 7, who ended the show with a Moment of Zen supposedly holding a clue about the announcement. On the same day, Colbert acknowledged the online movement. He played a clip of Beck saying the geese at his event were sent by God, and insisted that he would need his own God geese to tell him to hold a rally. After consulting \"Geese Witherspoon\" and a bottle of Grey Goose vodka, Colbert responded to Stewart's announcement with a promise to make \"an even bigger counter-announcement.\"\n\nThe next day, Stewart responded to Colbert's announcement by showing what was going on inside his brain, and yet again ended the show with an announcement-related Moment of Zen, as he did the next day.\n\nThe following Monday, Colbert finally responded to Stewart, first mocking him for his facial hair, then responding to the \"brain-cam\" with his own \"gut-cam.\" Colbert then brought up the online rally and how viewers were sending him toy geese and releasing doves outside his studio, finally asking people to stop sending him live animals.\n\nTo get Colbert's attention, Reddit users also encouraged people to donate to DonorsChoose, a charity organization that benefits teachers across the country. In less than a day, members of the Colbert Nation raised over $100,000. As of October 28, 2010, Reddit raised more than $500,000.\n\nSeptember 15's \"Daily Show\" ended with a toss to Colbert, and both acted coy about their competing announcements. That night's \"Colbert Report\" ended with Colbert announcing he would make his big announcement the next day, dropping hints that it would have to do with D.C. and the date October 10, 2010. On September 16, Colbert announced plans to host a 'Keep Fear Alive' rally on the National Mall on October 30, 2010.\n\nThe combined Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear was duly held on October 30, attracting nearly a quarter of a million participants. As the result of the rally, Metrorail set a new Saturday ridership record of 825,437 trips, as compared to about 350,000 trips on a normal Saturday.\n\nOn March 10, 2011, during a segment on 2012 presidential contender Tim Pawlenty's political action committee (PAC), Colbert announced the formation of his own PAC and hosted former FEC Chairman Trevor Potter on the program to help him fill out the paperwork. Troubled by the fact that large corporations were not donating to his SuperPAC, Potter explained that corporations prefer to support political causes when the corporations can remain anonymous. Therefore, he helped Colbert set up a 501(c)(4) Delaware Shell corporation in which donations can be given anonymously without limit and used for political purposes. Colbert asked what the difference was between that and money laundering. Potter answered, \"It's hard to say.\" On November 12, Colbert shut down his Super PAC, citing the death of his fictional advisor Ham Rove. Potter advised him that by making a check with the remaining funds out to his 501(c)(4), with an \"Agency Letter\" telling it to transfer that money to a second anonymous 501(c)(4), he would not have to tell anyone - even the IRS - what happened to that money.\n\nFollowing the creation of a non-profit organization by the owner of the Washington Redskins, Colbert said that he would create the \"Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever\" in order to bring attention to the hypocrisy of the name. The following day, Suey Park created the hashtag #CancelColbert in order to draw attention to a tweet made by the Comedy Central-operated account of \"The Colbert Report\". Park interpreted the tweet, which repeated the line from Colbert's show, as a tasteless joke made at the expense of Asians and Asian-Americans. Park's hashtag became a trending topic on Twitter, and the tweet was later deleted. While the hashtag was trending, Park's efforts were widely criticized by the media. Later stating that he never wants \"this to happen again,\" Colbert deleted the Comedy Central-run account on his show and directed people to follow his personal account.\n\nOn the June 4, 2014 episode, Colbert briefly broke down the details of a dispute that Amazon was having with book publisher Hachette, who has printed every book he has authored (and is the issuer for thousands more authors). In an \"LA Times\" interview; fellow Hachette author James Patterson expressed fear in regard to the depths Amazon will go to maintain control over book pricing, publishing, and sales of any e-retail in general. The main issue between the two companies is of e-book sales, and Amazon's lowering of prices to what certain publishers consider unsustainable for their business. Considering Amazon's domination when it comes to bookselling (between 40 and 50% of all book sales) and the myriad products it has since taken to selling due to its success with literature, it is slowing down or halting all sales of published or upcoming books produced by Hachette with no end in sight, notifying potential customers that it would be a better decision to shop elsewhere for any Hachette books. In response to his books being delayed or outright banned from being ordered, Colbert (as well as fellow Hachette author Sherman Alexie) encouraged the Colbert Nation to order \"California\" from first-time author Edan Lepucki from Portland, Oregon bookseller Powell's Books linked to Colbert's website (as well as \"I Didn't Buy It on Amazon\" stickers) and urged fans to refuse to purchase anything from Amazon until the conflict is resolved in a fair way. On the July 21 episode, Colbert repeated the experiment, asking Lepucki for a recommendation of another Hachette author. Lepucki gave the nod to Stephan Eirik Clark who authored \"Sweetness #9\".\n"}

Full-power analog television broadcasts, however, were required by U.S. federal law to cease by June 12, 2009. Low-power, Class A, and TV Translator stations are not currently required to cease analog broadcasts. Also by law, digital broadcasts - when transmitted as OTA signals - must conform to ATSC standards.; it is unclear whether satellite operators are free to use their own proprietary standards; and many standards exist for Internet television (most are proprietary).\n\nThe U.S. opted to adhere to ATSC standards for broadcast digital television. These standards define, among other things, format and transmission criteria that ensure consistency, accessibility, and fairness for consumers and equipment manufacturers alike in the U.S., as well as international compatibility.\n\nThe five main ATSC formats of DTV currently broadcast in the U.S. are:\n\nMost digital television sets sold in the U.S. use a display with a 16:9 aspect ratio to optimally display HDTV-formatted content. Lower-resolution sources like regular DVDs may be upscaled to the native resolution of the TV.\n\nCurrently, most Americans get digital television broadcasts via cable or satellite. Digital cable television systems with an activated channel capacity of 750 MHz or greater, are required by the FCC to follow ANSI/SCTE transmission standards with the exception of cable systems that only pass through 8 VSB modulated signals. Digital television sets (equipped with ATSC tuners) are often capable of viewing a baseline set of unencrypted digital programming, known as basic cable or low-tier channels, which typically include local network television affiliates. According to FCC regulations, the remaining encrypted channels must be viewable with a receiver equipped with a CableCARD.\n\nDigital television transmissions over-the-air (OTA) are now available in most metropolitan areas in the U.S., often carrying both standard-definition and high-definition (HDTV) transmissions of the same stations. In fact, by the analog shut-off date of June 12, 2009, all Full Power OTA stations in the U.S. will, by law, have to either transmit their broadcasts digitally, or shut down.\n\nMany stations have already used the switch to digital transmission as an opportunity to transition from 480i broadcasts to digital HD OTA broadcasts (either in 720p or 1080i), though this change is voluntary.\n\nWithin a distance of 35 to 40 miles from the broadcast stations, it is possible that no equipment more special than perhaps a simple antenna (such as \"rabbit ears\") may be necessary to receive a DTV broadcast signal OTA—at least some of the time for some of the channels. Any television equipped with an ATSC tuner may display DTV broadcasts properly. Some customers are already discovering that terrain, trees, rain, snow, wind, and even the movement of people around the room interfere with reception to one degree or another, from signals breaking up to total loss of signal. (Few ATSC-equipped televisions or converter boxes have internal antennas, in contrast to analog sets available in years past).\n\nIt was estimated that as of April 2007, 28% of American households had an HDTV set, a total of 35 million sets, and that 86% of owners were highly satisfied with the HDTV programming Estimates are that by the end of 2010, some 59% of American TVs had transitioned to HDTVs. All TV stations currently broadcast in both digital and analog and major networks broadcast in HD in most markets.\n\nWhile many in the industry wanted a flexible or delayed deadline, the FCC forced the issue at the behest of Congress. Congress wanted to reclaim some of the spectrum used for analog and repurpose that for emergency services. They also wanted to auction off bandwidth between 76-88 MHz frequencies (channels 5 and 6) and old analog UHF channels 60 to 69, and channels 52 to 59 by mandating DTV tuners be phased into all new TV sets. Many transition dates were proposed, but Congress finally fixed February 17, 2009 (later extending it until June 12, 2009), in law as the maximum end date for analog television authorizations. Because this date comes after the NCAA's Bowl Championship Series and the NFL's Super Bowl XLIII, there will be less of a chance of an acute hardware shortage from people waiting until the last minute to purchase an ATSC tuner than there would have been with a January 1 cutoff. The original deadline of January 1, 2006 was abolished when it was realized that TV stations and customers would not be able to meet the earlier deadline.\n\nIn March 2008, the FCC requested public comment on turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5 and 6 (76–88 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital television transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed to June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies corresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76 MHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\nUltimately, VHF Channels 5 and 6 were retained for digital broadcast television use after the transition, though the FCC had continued researching the possibility of re-allocating the two channels to an expanded FM band.\n\nOn August 22, 2011, the United States' Federal Communications Commission announced a freeze on all future applications for broadcast stations requesting to use channel 51, to prevent adjacent-channel interference to the A-Block of the 700 MHz band. On December 16, 2011, Industry Canada and the CRTC followed suit in placing a moratorium on any future Channel 51 television station applications.\n\nOn May 8, 2008, FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin announced the agency would test run the transition to digital terrestrial television in Wilmington, North Carolina, beginning September 8, 2008. This test run was to work out problems that might have occurred before the complete transition.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34549122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34549122", "title": "Dustforce", "text": "Dustforce\n\nDustforce is a platform video game developed by Hitbox Team. The game was released in January 2012 for Microsoft Windows via Steam, and Mac OS X through Steam in May 2012. A Linux port was released as part of the Humble Indie Bundle 6. Capcom published the game for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox 360.\n\nWithin the game, the player controls one of four janitors who are attempting to sweep away a world corrupted with dust and filth. The player uses a number of acrobatic skills, such as double jumping and wall jumping to progress through the game's fifty-some levels, cleaning sections covered by leaves and attacking filth-covered creatures to score and progress through the level. The player's performance is ranked based on time and completion, and access to certain levels requires near-perfect runs of earlier levels.\n\n\"Dustforce\" is a platform game that has been compared to games such as \"Super Meat Boy\" and \"N+\", where fast-response timed actions are considered necessary to complete the game. It is set in a world where filth has corrupted the creatures that live in the area; the four-member Dustforce team of janitors aims to clean up the mess and restore the world. An overworld provides access to more than fifty levels, though about half are initially locked to the player.\nAfter the player selects a level, they pick one of the four Dustforce members, who all share the same moves but have slightly different statistics, such as jumping height. Within the level, the player must maneuver their character to the end goal using acrobatic tricks such as double jumps, wall jumps, mid-air dashes, and clinging to the ceiling. Along the way, the character will automatically sweep up any debris on the walls or floors. The player can also initiate regular and super-attacks against filth-covered creatures to restore them to normal. The end goal of a level typically requires reaching a final area and defeating foes waiting there. Should the character run into any hazards such as pits or spikes on the level, the player will have to resume the run from a previous checkpoint.\n\nUpon completing a level, the player is ranked based on \"finesse\" and completion. Finesse is determined by the combo meter, which is reset if the player takes a hit or proceeds too slowly, and completion is determined by the amount of debris and enemies cleaned. The ratings, evaluated separately, are based on a letter-grade scale, with \"D\" through \"A\" reflecting increasingly better performances, and an \"S\" grade, representing a perfect combo, or full completion. Completing a level with an \"S\" grade in both finesse and completion provides the player with one of three colored keys to unlock certain levels in the overworld.\n\nThe player is also rated on a scoring system and ranked on a global leaderboard. The player scores a fixed number of points for every patch of filth that is cleaned up multiplied by their current combo meter, and increases their current combo meter by 1. The combo meter only stays active for a short period of time, but resets for each patch cleaned up; thus by hitting many patches in a row quickly, the player can build up the combo multiplier and drastically increase their score. Player replays are stored online with the leaderboards, allowing other players to review how top scorers were able to complete various levels. The PlayStation 3 version will include the ability to save and share level replays to YouTube, while this, the Vita, and Xbox 360 version will include the ability to save replays locally.\n\n\"Dustforce\" includes a four-player local multiplayer mode including variants such as Survival and King of the Hill modes, where players scale the level and fight against other players towards victory. Players can act as the janitors, cleaning up filth, while the other players lay down filth on clean patches of the level.\n\nA level editor for both single player and multiplayer maps was released as part of a patch for the Windows version of the game and the debut of the Mac OS X version. Levels are shared through a website created by Hitbox Team. The PlayStation and Xbox versions includes 150 user-generated level as voted on by players.\n\nDesigner Woodley Nye came up with the idea one day while sweeping a pile of leaves. The team was working on another game at the time but switched to \"Dustforce\" when they heard about the Indiepub contest. In designing the game Nye wanted to create an acrobatic 2D platformer. He credits the games \"N\" and \"Nikujin\" as inspirations for the project. Hitbox has also stated that the game \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" was an influence to the team citing its easy pick up and play approach while still maintaining a level of depth for experienced players. In selecting the art style Nye opted for a simplistic style that would showcase the various frames of animation. He has cited \"Dragon Ball Z\" as an influence in terms of design aesthetic stating that \"they have great poses and also good shapes\".\n\n\"Dustforce\" won the $100,000 Grand Prize at indiePub Games' Third Independent Game Developers Competition at the 2010 Game Developers Conference Online. The money was used by the four-person Hitbox team to develop the game over about one and a half years.\n\nAfter about a year of its successful release on Microsoft Windows, Capcom talked to Hitbox about porting the title to consoles. Capcom used their localization team, QLoc, to support the transition to console and managing features like leaderboards and replay saving. The console version will include 150 user-created levels from the Windows version as voted on by players.\n\nOn 10 January 2012, the developers announced in a blog post that the game would be released in a week's time, on 17 January 2012. The blog post, which also contained a gameplay trailer (right), surprised the gaming media.\n\nOn October 23, 2014, Hitbox announced on their website that a free update to Dustforce, Dustforce DX, was available to all owners of the base game. The DX update added 109 community maps accessible through an in-game console, a new music track by Lifeformed, and support for Steam trading cards. The update also included changes designed to make the game friendlier to newer players. The single tutorial was broken into 3 separate maps, 16 easier levels were added, and the 4 world hubs were consolidated into a single area. The overworld redesign makes it more difficult to reach the harder levels. According to Hitbox developer Woodley Nye, the redesign “helps in two ways: it keeps new players away from levels they aren't ready for yet, and it serves as a teaching tool for more advanced techniques that are required in the tougher levels.”\n\n\"Dustforce\" was generally well received by critics, praised for its demanding gameplay, online leaderboard features, graphics, and soundtrack. Kyle Orland of Ars Technica, was pleased with the difficulty of the game even after facing levels he could not complete, and considered \"Dustforce\" as \"a game that's not content to let you be content with yourself, and for that it's definitely worth playing\". Marsh Davies of Eurogamer considered that once a player can work their way through a level with perfect completion, \"it's hard not to admire the pat precision of the controls or deny the transcendent joy of a high-ranking run\". The use of reviewing online replays was highly praised to help players that were stumbling with the game. IGN's Anthony Gallegos considered the replays to be not only \"awesome and humbling\" to review, but also aiding in teaching the player of new techniques. Several noted that \"Dustforce\" is the type of game that a player may get frustrated with quickly after replaying levels over and over to get the \"S\" grades, but this emotion is calmed by the game's graphics and music. \"PC Gamer\"s Lucas Sullivan considered that the combination of the \"soothing, ethereal background music\" and \"fluid animations and beautifully stylized character designs\" provided a zen-like meditative setting for the player to practice within. Nathan Grayson of GameSpy considered that \"the whole audio-visual package colludes to create a strikingly powerful soothing effect\" that contrasts the tight demands of the gameplay.\n\nSome reviewers noted that the game fails to fully explain some of its features through the simplistic menus. There is no immediate information about the differences between the characters when selecting one prior to a level, and the multiplayer mode is not well explained. Others noted that the multiplayer mode felt like an add-on, and without online connectivity, would likely not be a feature many gamers would play. Although the game defaults to the use of keyboard controls, several found these to be a hindrance and switched to a gamepad, which had to be configured manually. Some reviewers also noted that the game has some performance issues based on its initial release.\n\nSales of the game were boosted by both being featured in a mid-week Steam promotion in May 2012, its inclusion in the Humble Bundle, and further discounts during 2012 holiday season sales. Hitbox states that the team directly earned US$ 489,000 after one year of sales, which will be used to fund development of their next game, \"Spire\".\n"}

Different countries, states and jurisdictions have different laws ranging from complete prohibition to no laws at all, making online gambling de facto legal and unregulated. To determine whether a potential online gambler should be allowed to deposit, play or even view an online casino it is necessary to determine the individual's physical location.\n\nOnline casinos and poker rooms have used geolocation in various ways over time. The first online casinos existed when few laws governed the internet (let alone online gambling), and players were simply asked to state their location. As laws regulating online gambling were passed, it became necessary to use technology to prove the physical location of players.\n\nWhen the first hand of licensed and regulated online poker in the United States was dealt in Nevada on April 30, 2013 by UltimatePoker.com, the site relied on a combination of a player's IP address and GPS signal from their cellular phone. Many players experienced problems from this process that made it difficult or even impossible for them to be correctly geolocated in Nevada and prevented them from playing. Initially players located near the state's borders could not be geolocated with enough precision to allow them to pass the Nevada location check. People who did not have mobile phones could not play at all.\n\nAs the industry expanded to the state of New Jersey, a new method of geolocation was deployed. This method triangulated wifi networks near the player to determine his or her physical location. This method was much more precise. Players reported fewer difficulties and even those located close to New Jersey's border could still correctly pass the geolocation check.\n\nIn order to prevent players outside a regulated state from bypassing the geolocation test using VPNs, the software checks for VPN and remote access software running on the player's system. If any such software is detected, the player is not allowed to wager.\n\nIn 2018, Pennsylvania became the fourth US state to license and regulate the industry. One requirement in Pennsylvania is that online gambling is not permitted inside brick and mortar casinos. This presents the unique challenge of disallowing play in certain physical locations within a state in which online gambling is otherwise authorized. Additionally in 2018 the US Supreme Court found the national Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 to be unconstitutional, paving the way for states to authorize sports betting. Since mobile device sports betting is an popular pastime, more states are likely to require geolocation services.\n"}

It is a first-person adventure horror, designed to be a serious take on ghost hunting and paranormal research, featuring real-world haunted locations.\n\nIntrigued by the player's supernatural talent of clairvoyance, a struggling university department asks them to join their secret research team, making them a front-field operative in paranormal investigations. Using a wide range of ghost-hunting gadgets and abilities they will conduct missions to investigate real haunted sites, collect samples and gather evidence.\n\nEach mission is an open-ended haunted ground - a playable sandbox with its own story. The university is the player's home base, where their work will be evaluated, results assessed and where they will be briefed for their next mission.\n\nEven though this is a horror game, ghosts won't appear without provocation. It is the player's task to find out how, to meet their objectives.\n\nDuring missions, ambidexterity will be a plus. The player's left hand will operate most of their gadgets and their right will interact with objects around them: turning a doorknob, pushing a door gently ajar, unearthing remains...\n\n\nSudden drops in temperature indicate the close proximity of a supernatural presence. The player should keep an eye out for the telltale sign: breath condensation. When the terror gets too intense, the player can press a button to close their eyes for as long as needed. Sometimes, when the player closes their eyes as they touch an object, visions appear. Their clairvoyance allows the player to experience flashbacks associated with an object's history, which may feed the player important information about a ghost’s past or reveal further clues connected to the investigation.\n\nThe game was announced at the Game Developers Session 2015 and was scheduled to be released in Q4 2017. On February 12, 2016, the game was greenlit on Steam. and on April 13, 2016 it went live on KickStarter.\nHowever, according to the game's official website and the Steam Greenlight page, the game has been delayed to Q4 2018. However, no news has been provided by the developers to support that claim. Some are speculating that the project has been cancelled without refunding the money back to their generous backers. No news about the overall progress of the game has been announced since 2017, leaving the fans disappointed and frustrated.\n"}

In 2008, Goldblatt was convicted of perpetrating acts of rape as well as other sex offenses against women in his acting class.\n\nHanan Goldblatt was born in 1941 in Tel Aviv. In his youth Goldblatt studied in the youth village HaKfar HaYarok along with Yisrael Poliakov, and together they performed in various skits in the events and parties. Goldblatt did his mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces in the Nahal troupe, the military band of the Nahal Brigade.\n\nAfter Goldblatt finished his military service he founded the band \"HaTarnegolim\" (The Roosters) together with several veteran members of Israeli military bands, under the musical guidance of Naomi Polani. In the early 1960s Goldblatt left the band in favor a theater career. In 1962 Goldblatt participated in the play \"Root of All Evil\" (שורש כל רע) at the Hamam Club in Jaffa, in which he played alongside Yoram Gaon, Bomba Tzur, Yosef Carmon and Margalit Ankori.\n\nIn 1966, Goldblatt played in the Israeli musical film \"The Flying Matchmaker\" alongside Mike Burstyn, Mordechai Arnon and Oshik Levy. In the late 1960s Goldblatt established the entertainment trio \"Shlishyat HaTeomim\" (שלישיית התאומים) together with Mordechai Arnon and Oshik Levy, which performed until 1970.\n\nAfter the entertainment trio was disbanded, Goldblatt traveled to the United States. At the end of the 1970s, he returned to Israel and joined the staff of the children TV series \"Carousel\" (קרוסלה), in which he portrayed the balloon seller \"Hanan Annan\". Afterwards Goldblatt participated in the Educational TV series \"Bli Sodot\" in which he portrayed the detective \"Gashash Balash\". Following the series, the participants of the series raised a theatrical show for children.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Goldblatt wrote the children's play \"An amazing moment in the carousel\" (רגע מדהים בקרוסלה) in which he also performed alongside Tzipi Moore and the magician Yoreinu (יוריני). During those years Goldblatt produced a solo album which included only songs he wrote by himself. During this period Goldblatt began directing shows for military bands, and appeared in the movies \"Melech LeYom Ehad\" (1982), \"Ko'ach Meshiha\" (1988), \"Irit, Irit\" (1985), and more.\n\nDuring the 1990s Goldblatt participated in children's educational TV show \"BeSod HaInyanim\", and directed the summer TV show \"Dagi Digitaly\".\n\nThrough the years Goldblatt dubbed the voices of various characters in Israeli Hebrew-speaking TV shows and films.\n\nIn addition to his career as a performing actor, through the years Goldblatt also taught theater in a number of acting schools. In 2004 Goldblatt began hosting the program \"אדם ומלואו\" at Channel 33 (after the sudden death of former host Uzi Hitman). In addition, Goldblatt played a cameo role in two episodes of the Israeli sitcom \"HaPijamot\" as Micah, the uncle of Alona Tal.\n\nIn August 2005, Goldblatt was arrested on suspicion of acts of rape and sodomy at various acting students, among them several minors, who came to his apartment to study acting. His arrest came after three young women complained to police. Six more women came forward and pressed charges soon afterward, although two of these cases could not be prosecuted as the statute of limitations had expired. Some of the complainants had been minors when the offenses were carried out. Police determined there was sufficient evidence for an indictment, and Goldblatt was indicted in the Tel Aviv District Court on August 21, 2005. Goldblatt denied the accusations and pleaded not guilty, claiming he never forced himself on any of the complainants. On July 3, 2008, following a lengthy trial, Goldblatt was convicted of two counts of rape and sodomy, two counts of indecent assault, committing an indecent act, abuse of authority, and aggravated fraud. He was acquitted of two counts of attempted indecent assault, one count of assault, one count of attempted rape, and one count of fraud. The court referred to Goldblatt's assertion, noting: \n\nThe court noted that \"the events took place over many years, beginning in 1986 and lasted until 2004\" and various other women were also offended, but due to the statute of limitations Goldblatt would only be tried on his subsequent offenses.\n\nDuring his trial, Goldblatt noted that in some cases he was frivolous, and that some of the complainants' were offended by him in one way or another. Goldblatt was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment, 2 years probation, and was ordered to pay 25,000 NIS in compensation to two of the victims. Goldblatt appealed to the Supreme Court on his conviction and of the punishment imposed on him. In February 2011 the Supreme Court partially accepted Goldblatt's appeal (as it replaced one of the two rape offenses of which he was convicted with fraud under aggravating circumstances), and cut his prison sentence by one year. In 2009, the state began seizing Goldblatt's assets after he refused to pay court-ordered compensation to two his victims, and ignored two demands for 50,000 NIS.\n\nOn November 19, 2012, Goldblatt was granted early release by the Board of Pardons for good behavior in prison and participation in rehabilitation programs. His actual release was delayed a week for the prosecution to appeal. On November 25, 2012, Goldblatt was released from prison after having served four years. He confessed that he had been guilty, and apologized for his actions.\n"}

A hand pay can also be triggered when the win is large enough that the number of coins required to pay out the win would be excessive.\n\nIn casinos that use ticket in, ticket out (cashless) systems, a hand pay can be caused by communication or other issues with the ticket printer. More frequently, it is caused by communication problems with the server which tracks and assigns ticket serial numbers. \n\nHand pays also occur whenever the amount of the win is over the minimum taxable win amount for the jurisdiction that the machine is in. Hand paying allows a floor attendant to collect the patron's identification and tax ID numbers (such as the Social Security number in the United States), and other pertinent information, such as the winning combination. The patron is then provided with the applicable tax forms. In the United States, a hand pay will normally occur for all wins over $1,200, which is the amount above which winnings must be reported to the IRS; some states may have lower thresholds where the taxes must be reported to the state revenue office. Citizens of the United States winning in that country will receive a W-2G tax form, and often a W-9 form to validate that the Social Security number they provided is correct.\n\nTo perform a hand pay, a floor attendant may complete a form which the patron presents to the cash cage to be paid out. In other casinos, the floor attendant will retrieve the funds and pay the patron directly. (The latter is typical for hand pays resulting from taxable wins.) Most casinos will require an electronic record of the hand pay to be made through the slot accounting system.\n"}
{"id": "38341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38341", "title": "Harlequin", "text": "Harlequin\n\nHarlequin (; , , Old French \"Harlequin\") is the best-known of the \"zanni\" or comic servant characters from the Italian \"Commedia dell'arte\". The role is traditionally believed to have been introduced by Zan Ganassa in the late 16th century, was definitively popularized by the Italian actor Tristano Martinelli in Paris in 1584–1585, and became a stock character after Martinelli's death in 1630.\n\nThe Harlequin is characterized by his chequered costume. His role is that of a light-hearted, nimble, and astute servant, often acting to thwart the plans of his master, and pursuing his own love interest, Columbina, with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot. He later develops into a prototype of the romantic hero. Harlequin inherits his physical agility and his trickster qualities, as well as his name, from a mischievous \"devil\" character in medieval passion plays.\n\nThe Harlequin character first appeared in England early in the 17th century and took centre stage in the derived genre of the Harlequinade, developed in the early 18th century by John Rich. As the Harlequinade portion of English dramatic genre pantomime developed, Harlequin was routinely paired with the character Clown. As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such in Victorian England were William Payne and his sons the Payne Brothers, the latter active during the 1860s and 1870s.\n\nAlthough the origins of the Harlequin are obscure there are several theories for how the character came to be. One theory posits that the name is derived from a bird with polychromatic feathers called a \"Harle\" Another theory suggest that the name Harlequin is taken from that of a mischievous \"devil\" or \"demon\" character in popular French passion plays. It originates with an Old French term \"herlequin\", \"hellequin\", first attested in the 11th century, by the chronicler Orderic Vitalis, who recounts a story of a monk who was pursued by a troop of demons when wandering on the coast of Normandy (France ) at night.\nThese demons were led by a masked, club-wielding giant and they were known as \"familia herlequin\" (var. \"familia herlethingi\"). This medieval French version of the Germanic Wild Hunt, \"Mesnée d'Hellequin\", has been connected to the English figure of \"Herla cyning\" (\"host-king\"; German Erlkönig). \nHellequin was depicted as a black-faced emissary of the devil, roaming the countryside with a group of demons chasing the damned souls of evil people to Hell. The physical appearance of Hellequin offers an explanation for the traditional colours of Harlequin's red-and-black mask. The name's origin could also be traced to a knight from the 9th century, Hellequin of Boulogne, who died fighting the Normans and originated a legend of devils. Cantos XXI and XXII from Dante's \"Inferno\" there is a devil by the name of Alichino. The similarities between the devil in Dante's \"Inferno\" and the Arlecchino are more than cosmetic and that the prank like antics of the devils in the aforementioned antics reflect some carnivalesque aspects.\n\nThe first known appearance on stage of Hellequin is dated to 1262, the character of a masked and hooded devil in \"Jeu da la Feuillière\" by Adam de la Halle, and it became a stock character in French passion plays.\n\nThe re-interpretation of the \"devil\" stock character as a zanni character of the commedia dell'arte took place in the 16th century in France.\nZan Ganassa, whose troupe is first mentioned in Mantua in the late 1560s, is one of the earliest known actors suggested to have performed the part, although there is \"little hard evidence to support [it].\" Ganassa performed in France in 1571, and if he did play the part there, he left the field open for another actor to take up the role, when he took his troupe to Spain permanently in 1574.\n\nAmong the earliest depictions of the character are a 1570-1571 Flemish painting in the Museum of Bayeux and several woodblock prints probably dating from the 1580s in the Fossard collection, discovered by Agne Beijer in the 1920s among uncatalogued items in the Nationalmuseum Stockholm.\n\nTristano Martinelli is the first actor definitely known to have used the name 'Harlequin' (or 'Arlequin') for the \"secondo zanni\" role, and he probably first performed the part in France in (or just before) 1584 and only later brought the character to Italy, where he became known as Arlecchino. The motley costume is sometimes attributed to Martinelli, who wore a linen costume of colourful patches, and a hare-tail on his cap to indicate cowardice. Martinelli's Harlequin also had a black leather half-mask, a moustache and a pointed beard. \nHe was very successful, even playing at court and becoming a favourite of Henry IV of France, to whom he addressed insolent monologues (\"Compositions de Rhetorique de Mr. Don Arlequin\", 1601).\nMartinelli's great success contributed to the perpetuation of his interpretation of the zanni role, along with the name of his character, after his death in 1630, among others, by Nicolò Zecca, active c. 1630 in Bologna as well as Turin and Mantua.\n\nThe character was also performed in Paris at the Comédie-Italienne in Italian by Giovan Battista Andreini and Angelo Costantini (c. 1654–1729) and in French as \"Arlequin\" in the 1660s by (1636–1688), who combined the zanni types, \"making his Arlecchino witty, neat, and fluent in a croaking voice, which became as traditional as the squawk of Punch.\" \nThe Italians were expelled from France in 1697 for satirizing King Louis XIV's second wife, Madame de Maintenon, but returned in 1716 (after his death), when Tommaso Antonio Vicentini (\"Thomassin\", 1682–1739) became famous in the part. The rhombus shape of the patches arose by adaptation to the Paris fashion of the 17th century by Biancolelli.\n\nThe primary aspect of Arlecchino was his physical agility. He was very nimble and performed the sort of acrobatics the audience expected to see. The character would never perform a simple action when the addition of a cartwheel, somersault, or flip would spice up the movement.\n\nEarly characteristics of Arlecchino paint the character as a second zanni servant from northern Italy with the paradoxical attributes of a dimwitted fool and an intelligent trickster. Arlecchino is sometimes referred to as putting on a show of stupidity in a metatheatrical attempt to create chaos within the play. Physically, Arlecchino is described as wearing a costume covered in irregular patches, a hat outfitted with either a rabbit or fox's tail, and a red and black mask. The mask itself is identified by carbuncles on the forehead, small eyes, a snub nose, hollow cheeks, and sometimes bushy brows with facial hair. Arlecchino is often depicted as having a wooden sword hanging from a leather belt on his person.\n\nAside from his acrobatics, Arlecchino is also known for having several specific traits such as: \nand several other techniques.\n\nOne of the major distinctions of \"commedia dell'arte\" is the use of regional dialects. Arlecchino's speech evolved with the character. Originally speaking in a Bergamo dialect, the character adopted a mixture of French and Italian dialects when the character became more of fixture in France so as to help the performers to connect to the common masses.\n\nVarious troupes and actors would alter his behaviour to suit style, personal preferences, or even the particular scenario being performed. He is typically cast as the servant of an \"innamorato\" or \"vecchio\" much to the detriment of the plans of his master. Arlecchino often had a love interest in the person of Columbina, or in older plays any of the Soubrette roles, and his lust for her was only superseded by his desire for food and fear of his master. Occasionally, Arlecchino would pursue the innamorata, though rarely with success, as in the \"Recueil Fossard\" of the 16th century where he is shown trying to woo Donna Lucia for himself by masquerading as a foreign nobleman. He also is known to try to win any given lady for himself if he chances upon anyone else trying to woo her, by interrupting or ridiculing the new competitor. His sexual appetite is essentially immediate, and can be applied to any passing woman.\nBetween the 16th and 17th centuries Arlecchino gained some function as a politically aware character. In the \"Comèdie itlaienne\" Arlecchino would parodie French tragedies as well comment on current events.\n\nDuchartre lists the following as variations on the Harlequin role:\n\nTrivelino or Trivelin. Name is said to mean \"Tatterdemalion.\" One of the oldest versions of Harlequin, dating to the 15th century. Costume almost identical to Harlequin's, but had a variation of the 17th century where the triangular patches were replaced with moons, stars, circles and triangles. In 18th century France, Trivelino was a distinct character from Harlequin. They appeared together in a number of comedies by Pierre de Marivaux including L'Île des esclaves.\n\nTruffa, Truffaldin or Truffaldino. Popular characters with Gozzi and Goldoni, but said to be best when used for improvisations. By the 18th century was a Bergamask caricature.\n\nGuazzetto. In the seventeenth century, a variety of anonymous engravings show Guazzetto rollicking, similar to Arlechino. He wears a fox's brush, a large three-tiered collarette, wide breeches, and a loose jacket tied tightly by a belt. He also dons a neckerchief dropped over the shoulders like a small cape. Guazzetto's mask is characterized with a hooked nose and a mustache. His bat is shaped like a scimitar-esque sword.\n\nZaccagnino. Character dating to the 15th century.\n\nBagatino. A juggler.\n\nPedrolino or Pierotto. A servant or valet clad in mostly white, created by Giovanni Pellesini.\n\n16th century\n17th century\n18th century\n19th century\n20th century\n\nThe Harlequin character came to England early in the 17th century and took center stage in the derived genre of the Harlequinade, developed in the early 18th century by the Lincoln's Fields Theatre's actor-manager John Rich, who played the role under the name of Lun. As the Harlequinade portion of English pantomime developed, Harlequin was routinely paired with the character Clown.\n\nTwo developments in 1800, both involving Joseph Grimaldi, greatly changed the pantomime characters. Grimaldi starred as Clown in Charles Dibdin's 1800 pantomime, \"Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World\" at Sadler's Wells Theatre. For this elaborate production, Dibdin introduced new costume designs. Clown's costume was \"garishly colourful ... patterned with large diamonds and circles, and fringed with tassels and ruffs,\" instead of the tatty servant's outfit that had been used for a century. The production was a hit, and the new costume design was copied by others in London. Later the same year, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in \"Harlequin Amulet; or, The Magick of Mona.\" Harlequin was modified to become \"romantic and mercurial, instead of mischievous\", leaving Grimaldi's mischievous and brutish Clown as the \"undisputed agent\" of chaos, and the foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who retained stylized dance poses. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s, who contributed to 20th-century \"slapstick\" comedy.\n\n\n\n"}

A row or square matrix of panels share a control module. The control modules are typically connected to the computer via USB cables.

The latter has for two centuries been attributed to Mozart but evidence has shown that the music of the piece was composed by Wenzel Trnka and Mozart merely replaced the original lyrics with his own.\n\nIn August 2011, Insane Clown Posse was contacted by Jack White, who invited Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler to his mansion, because he wanted to collaborate with them.

The low-budget movie, Yang's directorial debut, was filmed over 29 days in basically one location.\n\nThe story begins when a jobless man (Xu) and his doofus cousin (Wang) hold hostage the young employees (Li and Qiao) at a 24-hour supermarket, because the mart owner (Yang) had denied his lottery win. Hilarity ensues when a moronic prankster (Zhao), a myriad of shoppers, the mean owner and an at-large gunman (Zhang) enter the mart one after another.\n\nBespectacled nerd Li Junwei (Qiao Renliang) and pretty girl Tang Xiaolian (Li Xiaolu) are manning the night shift at the 24-hour Wang Wang Supermarket when balding lottery addict He Sanshui (Xu Zheng) arrives, demanding to speak to the lady owner Wang Sufen (Yang Qing). Wang, who is not in, made a typo entering the lottery number more than a month ago, which rendered He Sanshui's winning ticket useless. When He Sanshui asked for the ¥9500 win at an earlier occasion, she attacked him and drove him out of her store. This time, He Sanshui returns with a stun gun flashlight and his dimwitted cousin He Damiao a.k.a. Tire (Wang Dongfang), and is determined to get his ¥9500 \"back\". \n\nAt this moment, Li's goofy roommate Zhu Liao (Zhao Yingjun) who wants to record a funny prank video also storms in, wearing a pantyhose on his face and wielding a knife, but is quickly tasered down by He Sanshui. He Sanshui proceeds to the cashier counter and realizes there isn't enough cash in the cash register. He and Tire rope up everyone else in the soundproof back room—which has a complete Karaoke system—and taking their place behind the register begin to run the store, funneling the profits into their own pockets. \n\nThe hungry Tire is getting preoccupied with bag after bag of junk food (some of which have expired) and Karaoke singing in the back, so Li—whom He Sanshui calls \"Little Steel Teeth\" because he wears a dental brace—is brought back out to help with the work. Some time later, Tang's escape attempt, during which she tasers down Tire, is spoiled by Zhu's foolishness and He Sanshui's second stun gun. \n\nWang suddenly returns to the store from her Mahjong games—obvious having lost all her money—and immediately begins to attack He Sanshui with a bag of weight before Tire tasers her down. However, holding her (and her French Bulldog Wang Wang) hostage does nothing to the business, which has been slow tonight. In an effort to boost sales He Sanshui decides to give 50% discount to all store items, and business quickly perks up after a taxicab chauffeur (Cao Li) helps spread the news to his colleagues. During this time, Tang discovers voyeuristic photos of hers in Li's phone and realizes that Li likes her.\n\nWith ¥3.50 to go before their ¥9500 goal (taking into account that Tire has eaten ¥118.10 of food), a Guanzhong dialect-speaking, gun-toting robber (Zhang Jiayi) on the run arrives to retrieve a diamond his partner left in the ice in the store freezer. Unable to find his diamond he takes everyone hostage and is in the middle of having everyone strip, when Yaozi (Ye Qian)—the store's delivery man who has fallen asleep in the warehouse—barges out from the rear. The group tries to subdue the gunman, but fails because He Sanshui's stun gun has run out of battery. \n\nWhen the diamond is finally discovered during the subsequent search, the dog Wang Wang picks it up and runs outside. This is when the gunman realizes that the police have already surrounded the store: it was Tang who secretly texted a policeman shopper (Li Weijian). The gunman runs back inside, grabs Tang and points his gun to her head.

In this respect such afterpieces anticipate the ballad operas of the 18th century. At the same time, the French masque was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery. Inigo Jones became the leading designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries. These masques contained songs and dances. In Ben Jonson's \"Lovers Made Men\" (1617), \"the whole masque was sung after the Italian manner, stilo recitativo\".\n\nThe approach of the English Commonwealth closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera. However, in 1656, the dramatist Sir William Davenant produced \"The Siege of Rhodes\". Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers (Henry Lawes, Cooke, Locke, Coleman and Hudson) to set sections of it to music. This success was followed by \"The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru\" (1658) and \"The History of Sir Francis Drake\" (1659). These pieces were encouraged by Oliver Cromwell because they were critical of Spain. With the English Restoration, foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, Thomas Shadwell's \"Psyche\", patterned on the 1671 'comédie-ballet' of the same name produced by Molière and Jean-Baptiste Lully. William Davenant produced \"The Tempest\" in the same year, which was the first Shakespeare play to be set to music (composed by Locke and Johnson).\n\nAbout 1683, John Blow composed \"Venus and Adonis\", often thought of as the first true English-language opera. Blow's immediate successor was the better known Henry Purcell. Despite the success of his masterwork \"Dido and Aeneas\" (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell's best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead he usually worked within the constraints of the semi-opera format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as Shakespeare in Purcell's \"The Fairy-Queen\" (1692) and Beaumont and Fletcher in \"The Prophetess\" (1690) and \"Bonduca\" (1696). The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator John Dryden) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell's early death at the age of 36.\n\nFollowing Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s, which is largely attributed to Thomas Arne both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, unsuccessfully in \"The Temple of Dullness\" (1745), \"Henry and Emma\" (1749) and \"Don Saverio\" (1750), but triumphantly in \"Thomas and Sally\" (1760). His opera \"Artaxerxes\" (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown opera seria in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. His modernized ballad opera, \"Love in a Village\" (1762), was equally novel and began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. Arne was one of the few English composers of the era who, although imitating many elements of Italian opera, was able to move beyond it to create his own voice. Charles Burney wrote that Arne introduced \"a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated\".\n\nBesides Arne, the other dominating force in English opera at this time was George Frideric Handel, whose \"opera serias\" filled the London operatic stages for decades, and influenced most home-grown composers such as John Frederick Lampe to write using Italian models in imitation of him.\nThis situation continued throughout the late 18th century and the 19th, with composers being influenced mainly by Italian opera in the manner of Rossini and his successors, Meyerbeer's grand operas and later by Wagner.\n\nAnother short period of intense creativity from English composers came in the years going roughly from the 1830s to the 1850s.\nThe Romantic operas of Michael Balfe (the only one whose fame spread throughout Europe), Julius Benedict, John Barnett, Edward Loder, G. A. Macfarren and William Wallace achieved great popularity both in Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nJohn Barnett made a serious attempt to follow in the footsteps of Carl Maria von Weber with his opera \"The Mountain Sylph\" (1834), often mistakenly claimed as the first Sung-through (i.e. completely sung) English opera, which was his only major success (and was later parodied by Gilbert and Sullivan in \"Iolanthe\").\nAmong the main lanes in London for the production of English language opera in those times were Drury Lane, the Princess's Theatre and the Lyceum. The King's Theatre and the Covent Garden, which were the two major opera houses of the city, featured mostly Italian and French opera (the latter usually translated into Italian). This was a source of continuous vexation for English composers who, until late in the century, had to see their works translated into Italian to be performed on those stages.\n\nMoreover, the constant presence of a foreign language opera season in the city meant that the operas of indigenous composers had constantly to compete with those of the great Italian composers, as well as those of Weber, Meyerbeer, Fromental Halévy and Gounod (the last three usually performed in Italian at the Covent Garden), which continued to dominate the musical stage in England. Beside Balfe, whose operas were translated into German, French and Italian (\"The Bohemian Girl\" as \"La Zingara\", for Trieste), the only other composers to gain so renown on the Continent and to have their operas translated into a foreign language were Benedict (into his native German) and Wallace (also in German).\nAfter the 1870s, the reputation of English Romantic Opera slowly started to decline until, by the end of the century, most critics' opinion was against them. The only works to be still performed well into the 1930s were \"The Bohemian Girl\", \"Maritana\" and \"The Lily of Killarney\".\n\nBeside foreign opera and European operetta, the most popular forms of indigenous entertainment in the second half of the 19th century were burlesques and late Victorian era light operas, notably the Savoy Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, both of which frequently spoofed operatic conventions.\n\nSullivan wrote only one grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\" (following the efforts of a number of young English composers beginning about 1876), but he claimed that even his light operas were to be part of an \"English\" opera school, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage throughout the 19th century into the 1870s. London's \"Daily Telegraph\" agreed. Sullivan produced a few light operas in the late 1880s and 1890s that were of a more serious nature than most of the G&S series, including \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", \"Haddon Hall\" and \"The Beauty Stone\", but \"Ivanhoe\" (which ran for 155 consecutive performances, using alternating casts—a record then and now) survives as his only real grand opera.\n\nLate in the century composers such as Isidore de Lara, Delius and Dame Ethel Smyth, owing to the difficulties of getting serious English operas staged at home, caused in part by the popularity of light opera, turned to the Continent to seek their fortune, with De Lara becoming very popular in France and in Italy (his opera Messaline being the first work by an Englishman to be produced at La Scala).\n\nIn the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of Ralph Vaughan Williams and Rutland Boughton and later Benjamin Britten, who, in a series of fine works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. \nNevertheless, foreign influence (now coming mainly from Wagner, Tchaikovsky and Strauss), was still strong. One example is Josef Holbrooke's \"The Cauldron of Annwn\" trilogy. The influence of Wagner's \"Ring\" can be seen in the choice of a mythological subject and also in the extensive use of \"leitmotivs\", while harmony and orchestration are more reminiscent of Strauss. \nOther British composers writing well-received operas in the late 20th century include Richard Rodney Bennett (e.g. \"The Mines of Sulphur\"), Harrison Birtwistle (\"Punch and Judy\"), Peter Maxwell Davies (\"Taverner\") and Oliver Knussen (\"Where the Wild Things Are\"). Today composers such as Thomas Adès continue to export English opera abroad.\n\nAlso in the 20th century, American composers like George Gershwin (\"Porgy and Bess\"), Gian Carlo Menotti, Leonard Bernstein, and Carlisle Floyd began to contribute English-language operas, frequently infused with touches of popular musical styles. They were followed by Philip Glass (\"Einstein on the Beach\"), Mark Adamo, John Adams (\"Nixon in China\"), and Jake Heggie. Moreover, non-native-English speaking composers have occasionally set English libretti (e.g. Igor Stravinsky, \"The Rake's Progress\"; Hans Werner Henze, \"We Come to the River\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11695023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11695023", "title": "Ramlila", "text": "Ramlila\n\nRamlila (Rāmlīlā) (literally 'Rama’s lila or play') is any dramatic folk re-enactment of the life of Rama according to the ancient Hindu epic \"Ramayana\" or secondary literature based on it such as the \"Ramcharitmanas\". It particularly refers to the thousands of Hindu god Rama-related dramatic plays and dance events, that are staged during the annual autumn festival of Navratri in India. After the enactment of the legendary war between Good and Evil, the Ramlila celebrations climax in the Dussehra (Dasara, Vijayadashami) night festivities where the giant grotesque effigies of Evil such as of demon Ravana are burnt, typically with fireworks.\n\nRama is the seventh avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu and the central figure of the \"Ramayana\", a Sanskrit epic that integrates performance arts with stories driven by ethical values. The epic text is dated to 1st millennium BCE, and Ramlila is an adaptation of those stories. Most Ramlilas in North India are based on the 16th century secondary work on Ramayana, \"Ramcharitmanas\" a verse form composition in the regional vernacular language (Hindi), by Tulsidas. These verses are used as dialogues in traditional adaptations. Open-air productions are staged by local Ramlila committees (\"Samitis\"), and funded entirely by the villagers or local neighborhoods in urban areas. The core team of performance artists train for the dance-drama, but the actual performance attracts impromptu participants from the audience and villagers. This art form is a part of the Hindu culture, found for many gods and goddesses, but those of Rama, Durga (as Durga Puja) and Krishna (as Rasa lila) are the most popular and annual events in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe Ramlila festivities were declared by UNESCO as one of the \"Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\" in 2008. Ramlila is particularly notable in historically important Hindu cities of Ayodhya, Varanasi, Vrindavan, Almora, Satna and Madhubani – cities in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. The epic and its dramatic play migrated into southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE, and \"Ramayana\" based \"Ramlila\" is a part of performance arts culture of Indonesia particularly the Hindu society of Bali, Myanmar, Cambodia and Thailand. In the 19th and 20th centuries, with the movement of Asian diaspora into European colonies as indentured servants, the cultural celebration of Ramlila is now found in many parts of the world.\n\n\"Ramlila\" is a compound Sanskrit words \"Rama\" (a Vishnu avatar) and \"Lila\" (play, game, sport). According to James Lochtefeld, the word connotes a \"playful drama about Rama\", where it is both entertainment and a \"deeply serious religious act\" that has spiritual significance to both the actors and the audience.\n\nA literal translation of Ram Lila, states Norvin Hein, is \"Rama's sport\" where the term \"sport\" is best understood in a theological context. According to the Vaishnava thought, the Supreme Being (Vishnu) has no need to create the empirical world, he just descends as an avatar and manifests in the empirical world to \"spontaneously, joyfully, disinterestedly play a part\" or engage in \"sports\".\n\nThe teams or companies of actors that train together and perform Ramlila are called \"Mandalis\".\n\nPerformance arts are an ancient Indian tradition, with the Sanskrit Hindu text \"Natya Shastra\" explaining the importance of performing arts as follows:\n<poem>\nLet Nātya (drama and dance) be the fifth vedic scripture.\nCombined with an epic story, \ntending to virtue, wealth, joy and spiritual freedom, \nit must contain the significance of every scripture, \nand forward every art.\n</poem>\n— \"Nātyaśāstra\" 1.14–15\nRamlila is one of many performance arts-related festivities within Hinduism. Ramayana epic is dated to the 1st millennium BCE, and is one of the oldest Itihasa genre of Indian literature. It is unclear however as to when the first performances of Ramlila were held. The first enactment of \"Ramcharitmanas\" by 16th century Tulsidas is undocumented, but according to the tradition, his student Megha Bhagat started the \"Ramcharitmanas\"-based Ramlila in 1625. According to Norvin Hein, a professor of Divinity and of Religious Studies specializing on Indology, Ramlila were in vogue before 1625, at least in North India between 1200 and 1500 CE, but these were based on Valmiki's \"Ramayana\". According to Richard Schechner, the contemporary Ramlila has deeper roots, as it incorporates both the teachings of ancient Sanskrit texts and modern theatre techniques.\nAccording to John Brockington, a professor of Sanskrit specializing on Indian epics, Ramlila is likely an ancient tradition of India because it is generally accepted by scholars that written manuscripts emerged later in Indian religions, and ancient texts were largely a product of oral tradition. Thus, not only Ramalila, but all ancient epics of India must very likely have been recited and transmitted by bards and students in Ramlila-like manner, verbally from one generation to another, and consistently preserved across a wide geographic region by rules of acting by many teams. Further, states Brockington, the Hindu epics are too vast, with the \"Ramayana\" containing 20,000 verses and the \"Mahabharata\" with 100,000 verses, to have been preserved over two thousand years without being written down and without reciting and acting out. It is therefore unlikely that the Ramlila tradition emerged only in the modern era.\n\nSome colonial era Indologists suggested, adds Brockington, that the \"Ramayana\" is a modern era text, but this hypothesis has since been abandoned because the existence of the Hindu \"Ramayana\" has been attested in Jainism literature, Ramayana reliefs in cave temples such as Ellora Caves, and southeast Asian temple carvings and culture by the 1st millennium CE.\n\nAccording to Norvin Hein, the contemporary Ramlila started once the \"Manas\" text of Tulsidas had been composed in the 16th century. However, states Hein, a dance-drama form of Ramayana enactment flourished at least in the Mathura region much earlier, possibly around the early centuries of the common era by the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism. He traces the evidence for this in the Kathakali, Yaksagana, Kathak and other Indian classical dances which share segments, themes and styles with Ramlila.\n\nJames Prinsep wrote an eyewitness description of Varanasi Ramlila festivities in 1825, while H. Niehus wrote another from Ghazipur in 1905. Norvin Hein described the Ramlila of 1949 and 1950, a period of socio-political turmoil in India after the British India partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan. Hein reported his observations from Ramilila in Mathura.\n\nThe Ramlila is the story of Hindu god Rama from his birth. The epic recites his childhood along with those of others who are major characters in it, such as Sita, Lakshmana, Ravana and others. It includes chapters on the marriage of Sita and Rama, the exile of Rama because Dharma requires him to give up his throne, Sita and Lakshmana joining him in the exile, their journeys through India and they meeting revered Rishis of Hinduism, the abduction of Sita by demon Ravana, the sorrow of Rama and Lakshmana, their hopelessness, how they creatively build an army from other living beings in the forest such as monkeys, their journey to Lanka to confront Ravana, the battle between the good and evil, the destruction of Ravana, the return of Rama to Ayodhya and as king, and the life thereafter.\nRamlila festivals play this story. It is organized in numerous villages, towns and neighborhoods during the autumn Navratri festival season which typically falls in September or October. The festival is both a religious and cultural event, bringing the population together, states UNESCO, \"without distinction of caste, religion or age\". The audience such as the villagers participate spontaneously, playing roles or help out in setting and cleaning up the stage, making costumes, and upkeep of the Ramlila area.\nTraditionally organized in a makeshift open-air theatre at night, it is usually staged by amateur acting teams drawn from all segments of the society. Singers and musicians, men and women, elderly and youth play different parts, sing the verses to music, recite dialogues. The recitations and the narrative of the play are usually based on \"Ramacharitamanas\". The dialog is improvised, and often responsive to audience reactions. Dhol drummers and other musicians participate. The atmosphere is usually festive and free, with the audience whistling and commenting as the story proceeds. The stage is surrounded by food stalls and larger productions have a fair nearby. Surrounding areas temporarily transform into bazaars to cater to the audience. A committee (\"samiti\") heads the preparation. In many rural areas, traditional venues for Ramlila have developed over the centuries, and hundreds of people will often make the trip nightly to attend the play, by walking over miles like a religious pilgrimage in earlier times. Actors typically don't get paid, or get paid little for their efforts, but they are provided free food and accommodation by the villagers or committee. Performance costs are usually financed by fundraising in the community, often by self-organized Ramlila Committees.\n\nA Ramlila is not a simple play acted out in a drama theatre, but it is structured to encourage and allow the audience to participate. In major productions, the audience walk with the actors from one site to another, they chant or co-recite passage, they immerse themselves as minor or significant characters in the play, while the major roles are played by a troupe of artists. The audience cheers when the good gets the upper hand, they are sorrowful when a wrong happens such as the kidnapping of Sita and her imprisonment against her will by demon Ravana. They participate in the burning of the effigies, and the community welcome during the return of Rama back to Ayodhya. It is theologically an immersion experience.\n\nToday, several regions have developed their distinctive form of Ramlila, Uttar Pradesh itself has numerous variants of presentation styles, most prominent among them is that of Ramnagar, Varanasi which is a 31-day event, while most Ramlila elsewhere are typically abridged 10 day event climaxing in Dussehra.\n\nOther variants include the pantomime style is visible in \"jhankis\" or tableaux pageants, where colourful Jhankis and pageants depicting scenes from the life of Lord Rama are taken out through the city. According to a 2008 UNESCO report, the most notable Ramlila traditions are those observed annually at Ayodhya, Ramnagar and Varanasi, Vrindavan, Almora, Satna and Madhubani.\n\nAnother variant is the operatic style incorporates elements of folk theatre elements generously, while the traditional style remains, where the couplets of Ramacharitmanas not only act as dialogues, but also as chorus as well, and lastly there is the Ramlila staged by professional troupes called \"mandalis\". Many urban Ramilias now have dialogues written in \"Khadi Boli\" or in local dialects, but the treatment remains melodramatic as always to achieve maximum impact amidst an audience that knows the story by heart, but watches the enactment nevertheless for religious fervour and also for its spectacle value, making Ramlila an important event in the religious as well as social calendar of not only in small town and villages but also many big cities. Just other folk theatre form of India, like Jatra of Bengal, topic themes are often interwoven in the script to had relevance and sometimes humour is used to offer a critic or commentary over current happenings.\n\nThe tradition of staging the Ramlila at Ramnagar, Varanasi, which lies across the Ganges river from the Hindu pilgrimage city of Varanasi, was started in ca 1830 by Maharaja Udit Narayan Singh, Kashi Naresh with the help of Pandit Laxmi Narayan Pandey's family (present vyas ji of the Ramlila of Ramnagar). It rose in popularity during the reign of his successor Maharaj Isvari Prasad Singh, and received continued patronage from the subsequent Kings of the Royal House of Benares to create a participatory environmental theatre (Site-specific theatre) on a grand scale, where attendance ranges from few thousands to 100,000 for others.\nThe Ramlila is a cycle of plays which recounts the epic story of Lord Rama, as told in \"Ramcharitmanas\", the version of the Ramayana penned by Tulsidas. The plays sponsored by the Maharaja, are performed in Ramnagar every evening for 31 days. The Ramnagar Ramlila is held over 31 days where the entire \"Ramacharitmanas\" is recited, instead of usual 10 for abridged production. It is known for its lavish sets, dialogues and visual spectacle. In Ramnagar, a number of stages have been constructed by the town, each named after the major sites of events in the \"Ramayana\" epic. The permanent structures and several temporary structure serve as sets, to represent locations like Ashok Vatika, Janakpuri, Panchavati, Lanka etc., during the performance. Hence the entire city turn into a giant open-air set, and audience moves along with the performers with every episode, to the next locale. As the play progresses, the actors and audience move from one place to another, they join the chorus, giving the feel that the audience is participating and is a part of the play.\nPreparations begin, weeks before its commencement, even the audition process is traditionally attended to by the Maharaja, where \"Svarupas\", literally divine embodiment, the various characters of the Ramayana, are chosen from amongst local actors. Important roles are often inherited by families, for example, the role of Ravana was held by same family from 1835 to 1990, and roles of Hanuman, Jatayu, and Janaka traditionally belong to one Vyasa family. When the Dussehra festivities are inaugurated with a colourful pageant Kashi Naresh rides an elephant at the head of the procession. Then, resplendent in silk and brocade, he inaugurates the month-long folk theatre of \"Ramlila\" at Ramnagar. During the period, hundreds of sadhus called \"Ramayanis\" descend into the town to watch and recite the Ramcharitmanas text. Many an audience carry a copy of the Ramacharit Manas, simply called Manas, and follow stanza after stanza, after the characters delivering their dialogue. The legend and the festival is a part of their spiritual practice, they do not go to Ramlila, they immerse in it.\nDuring the course of the performance, there is a double transformation of the space within the city, as it first transforms from a city to theatre and then to mythic geography, as the scale of the performance is gradually increased to mythic proportions, coming down only in the end, when Rama finally returns home, this is when the Raja himself becomes part of the theatre thereby incorporating local element into the story itself. In the end, as the \"swarups\", actors depart, they take off their garlands and offer it to Royal family members and give darshan to audience, after the performance one last time. At the end of each episode, lila, an aarti is performed, chants of 'Har Har Mahadev' or 'Bolo! Raja Ramchandra ki Jai!' resound in the air, as the audience join in. Thereafter, a \"jhanki\", literally a peep or glimpse, tableaux of frozen iconic moments from the 'Manas', is presented, which not only distill and crystallize the message of the story for the audience, but is also appreciated for its spectacular effect.\n\nThough several local legends exist regarding the beginning of this Ramlila, including one of which suggests that it was first staged at a nearby village, Chota Mirzapur as the one at Varanasi was disrupted due to the floods in the Ganges, from where it evolved to the present Ramlila, which is by far the most traditional rendition of the Ramayana, and has been a subject of study by scholars from all over the world for many decades now.\n\nOn the last day the festivities reach a crescendo as Rama vanquishes the demon king Ravana. Over a million pilgrims arrive annually for the vast processions and performances organized by Kashi Naresh.\n\nOver the centuries, Ramlila has evolved into a highly venerated art form, and has travelled to far corners of the globe, through Indian diaspora, not as acts of \"cultural recovery\", rather as fresh expressions of a persistent faith. Today, Ramalila is staged in most countries that with immigrant Hindu populations from the Indian subcontinent, including that from India, Nepal and Pakistan. Outside the Indian subcontinent, this includes Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa, Canada, Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Great Britain, The Netherlands, the United States, and Australia. Some Asian cultures have similar drama traditions based on the Ramayana, for instance the Phra Lak Phra Lam (Lak and Lam are the Laotian names for Lakshman and Ram, respectively) folkplay of Laos and northeastern Thailand.\n\nThe Rama story is also enacted in another popular art form as a night time fire shadow or day time puppet show. This is known as \"Tolapavakuthu\" in Kerala, \"Ravana chaya\" in Odisha, \"Nang sbek thom\" in Cambodia, \"Nang yai\" in Thailand and \"Wayang purwa\" in Indonesia.\n\n"}

In 1925, she appeared in \"Tan Town Topics\", with Ethel Waters as the leading star and Josephine Baker in the chorus.\n\nIn 1926, the show arrived at Paris's Restaurant des Ambassadeurs as \"Blackbirds of 1926\". The show opened on May 28, it was a sensation. Some of France's top stars attended, including Maurice Chevalier, Sacha Guitry, Yvonne Vallee, the Dolly Sisters and even Josephine Baker, who drifted in an hour late. The show moved over in July to the Theatre des Champs-Elysees, where Josephine Baker made her debut months earlier. One night, she was approached by Henri Lartigue, who worked for the William Morris Booking Agency and organized for the show to come to France, who offered her a lucrative contract in Berlin with a weekly salary of $200. Ruth signed the contract right then and there, agreeing to come work at the theatre in the following month, and afterward kept her own counsel. Several weeks later, Ruth departed immediately to appear at the Admiralspalast all-black revue \"An Und Aus\" in-between rehearsals for a much larger show at the Theatre des Westens. On August 4, \"Der Zug Nach dem Westen\" opened and Ruth made her appeared in a girdle of a dozen bananas. Her dancing was a large success to the German press with her extravagant jungle interpretation surrounded by a cast of 200. The revue was taken to the Apollotheater in Vienna for the winter before being rearranged into a new version with skimpier costumes and more American performers such as Ben Tyber and Louis Douglas under the name, \"Wissen Sie Schon\" opening in March 1927 and running for another three months. she appeared in the tableau 'Der Gott und Die Bajadere', dancing completely nude except for a silver loincloth in front of a large statue of Buddha; This time with a larger salary of $600. It's hard to say how much is truth, if any, there is in the many stories in Berlin, which state that a handsome Spanish Marquis would appear with Ruth late at night in the streets of the Friedrichstrasse and under the shadows of the Unter-Der-Linden. Later it was claimed that this Don Juan was none other than King Alfonso XIII of Spain. Undoubtedly, much of this gossip was generated by her onstage image as the personification of unbridled sexuality, just as her counterpart, Josephine Baker. That summer, Ruth appeared in Hamburg at the Argentinean-themed Trocadero Kabarett where she was showered with flowers and the German press billed her as the 'Most Beautiful Creole on the Continent.'\n\nRuth soon decided it was time to move on, and after an appearance in the French resort town Biarritz to perform for a charity event at the Chateau-Basque, accompanied the Spanish actor, Valeriano Ruiz Paris, into Barcelona to open his revue, \"Not-Yet\" at the Teatro Cómico where she introduced her new dance, the Chotiston, which was a mixture of the Charleston and the Chotis. While in Barcelona, she was followed by an old friend, Robert Wiene, a German film director, who wanted Ruth to star on in his latest film based on the love affair of one of the most gallant European Sovereigns and the most beautiful colored dancer in Europe at the moment. Filming wrapped up by the end of September and the German crew returned to Berlin. Ruth also moved on, in October, to Valencia to appear in the El Folies-Bergere cabaret, where a painting of herself (and Josephine Baker) hung above the stage. The following month, she travelled to Madrid to star in, \"Noche Loca\" at the Teatro Maravillas with a white American orchestra with a salary of $800 and musical scores composed by the famous Francisco Alonso. After hours, she performed at the exclusive Maipu-Pigall's nightclub, where King Alfonso and the Primo de Rivera was noted to frequent. That winter, before she could accept Louis Douglas's offer to appear in his Black Follies revue at the Teatro Comedia, Paul Derval, director of the Folies Bergere, invited her to return to Paris for the new season, as Josephine was leaving for a world tour.\n\nRehearsals for \"La Grande Folie\" began in February in-between her appearances at the Casanova nightclub. Meanwhile, however, she was approached by the director of the Folies-Wagram, a new musichall to be inaugurated the following month with \"Revue Wagram\", but Ruth turned him down. But early March, after two weeks at the Folies-Bergere, moved on to the Folies-Wagram. Avoiding Paul Derval for the next three months, she appeared with Marie Dubas dancing in the finale of the first act with tall and graceful, slim ankles, shapely well molded thighs, willowy but well developed body covered in the right proportion of blue ostrich feathers. But the rumors of her affair with the Spanish Monarch began to resurface, when her German film was released in on April 12. The Spanish government offered the German producers $187, 000 to destroy the film, or at least prevent it from appearing in France and Spain. She was making conquests in high society and on her string was Germany's wealthiest bankers. She lived at the Hotel Ambassador with a fine $10,000 Hispano-Suiza driven by a chauffeur and two maids. Something she would have never accomplished in America. \"Absolutely impossible,\" she later remarked to a visiting journalist, \"I would have never been given the opportunity. I love Paris, the German people have been very kind, and so have the folks in Spain.\" After working at Floresco Bonbonniere, she spent the summer in Deauville, dancing at the seaside casinos and appearing at the racetracks with a new admirer Armand Rochefoucauld, 'Marquis de Deauville'. At the Concert Mayol cabaret in late November Ruth was back dancing beside Marie Dubas in, \"Cochon Qui Sommeille\" (The Slumbering Pig) before returning for a quick appearance in Berlin's Barberina Kabarett, where she complained that the audience would try to grab her she danced. But the constant gloomy presence of the strongly emerging right-wing movement which was bent on purging the decadence of Weimar Germany. This was, of course, the infant Nazi movement and to them Ruth represented the both decadence and racial impurity in Germany.\n\nIn January, Ada 'Bricktop' Smith, left behind her old establishment of the Grand Duc, and opened Chez Bricktop's on the Place Pigalle. Besides Edith Wilson and Zaidee Jackson, Ruth returned from the German capital to appear. During this time, she purchased an apartment at 77 Champs-Elysees, once briefly occupied by Jo Baker herself. Soon she ran into Leon Abbey and his orchestra, and joined him on his Spanish tour to play in Seville which was hosting the Exposición Ibero-Americana. There was lots of money to be made as American tourists filled the nightclubs and theatres of the Andalucian city. There was also Barcelona's Exposició Internacional where they made an appearance on the Expo grounds. On her own however, Ruth also returned to Madrid and danced through the winter at the Maipu-Pigall's cabaret, which was known to be frequented by the Spanish monarch. On March 8, she rejoined Abbey's band in London to appear at the Deauville Restaurant. After two weeks, Leon was deported back to Paris for not obtaining his work permits before arriving in Britain. That summer, after an invitation while appearing in London, returned to Paris for the Theatre Apollo where she appeared with the dramatic singer, Damia and the American dancer Jack Forester in the new 'oriental-themed' revue \"Revue Milliardaire\". Once again, Ruth was chosen for the Oriental-style finale of the first act as Scheherazade in the 'Slave Merchant' sketch. After hours, she would dance the tango and mingle amongst her Spanish friends at the El Garron cabaret. After the triumphal revue closed in August, she joined Sam Wooding's band in \"La Jungle Enchante\" at the Theatre Olympia before moving over to the Theatre Marigny on September 7. In December 1930, as France prepared itself for the upcoming Exposition Coloniale, Ruth returned to New York to try her luck back in America to showcase her talents that were so well publicized in Europe.\n\nUpon arriving, she bought a spacious apartment in the elite Sugar Hill district near Harlem, but was immediately offered to return to France to accompany Noble Sissle's Orchestra at the Restaurant des Ambassadeurs. However, the French authorities were making determined efforts to reduce the number foreign workers, including overseas musicians, in their country. Ruth got wind of a rumor that suggested that Sissle's band would only be able permitted to fulfill the second half of its booking if 50 percent of its personnel were replaced was replaced with French artists. This proved to be the truth, and Ruth immediately declined the offer, remaining in New York to open a small boutique selling precious perfumes and fur wraps, until she got bored with the idea of being a businesswoman. The idea of being away from the stage brought her back into the nightlife, appearing in some of Harlem's popular establishments like Savoy Ballroom and the Small's Paradise in \"Ethel Baird's Revue\". However, her large fortune she accumulated abroad quickly faded away as she was unable to work under the same standards as she had in Europe. Early 1932, Ruth was offered a role in a floorshow at a ritzy Broadway cabaret and struck it rich again when she foiled a holdup and was awarded handsomely. By November, she was appearing in Newark, New Jersey and renting rooms from the mother of an old friend, Crackshot Hackley. It was there she got into an argument with one the tenants, John Burtt, white director of the Lafayette Theatre. This ended in Ruth beating him with a dog chain from one her numerous pets. The fight later involved Crackshot and his mother. After this scandal, Ruth packed her bags and informed her family she was moving to Spain (under a new stage name).\n\nIn February 1933, French press announced her return to France on the SS Lafayette. They were most enthusiastic about the return of their 'Belle Creole', but the depression arrived in Europe that winter, causing the economy to fall apart and public demonstrations all across France. Despite business in Montmartre to becoming rather slow, she was found performing at the Rio-Rita Cabaret. Ruth's appearances began to become sparse and she was later departed for Deauville, entertaining at the Bar du Soleil and Casino de Deauville. 79-year old Cora E. Rollins of Chicago, who spent the weekend visiting her son-in-law, Alex Carpenter, orchestra director of the Casino, ran into Ruth, whom she had met as a child in Philadelphia. Mrs. Rollins: \"Miss Bayton tried to persuade me to try my luck at the tables, but as I'm admittedly a bad loser, declined.\" Josephine Baker, who was also appearing at the Bar Soleil was enamored with Ruth's German banker lover, who was visiting and tried to become close with her old buddy in order to receive an introduction. But Ruth was no longer interested in reconnecting with her old cohort and wasn't naive about Jo's motives and snubbed her old friend. Soon afterwards, she departs to Spain and takes up residence in Madrid, where she continues working under another alias until Francisco Franco staged a military coup in Spanish Morocco on the 17th of July 1936, which made its way to south-western Spain quickly capturing southern and northwestern Spain. The country began to split into numerous factions, which quickly turned this small coup into a civil war. Back home, her family was worried sick about her whereabouts. They hadn't heard anything from her, since her return in 1933, when she stopped writing home. During the spring of 1937, they were still unable to contact Ruth when her Uncle George died. Soon however, there were strange rumors that she escaped into South America. This was confirmed by the summer, when she wrote home finally, her letters listed having arrived from Buenos Aires. Like many Spanish artists, she had escaped to Argentina, achieving huge success, both theatrically and romantically.\n\nDuring the summer of 1938, she even (for some unknown reason) stood trial at the Palacio de Justicia: \"By order of Mr. Investigating Judge for Criminal Matters in the capital of Argentina, Dr. Antonio L. Beiuti, is quoted calls and summons Ruth \"Virginia\" Bayton, so that within thirty days, computed from the first publication of this, appear to be right in the cause for false testimony that followed, failing to declare rebellious if not done.\" She remained in Argentina until the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, however found it difficult to work under Franco's strict regime, and sometime after the outbreak of the German invasion of Poland, returned home to Buenos Aires, despite its pro-German attitude. Shortly after the military coup during July 1943, Ruth returned to the United States for a brief visit.\n\nAfter WWII ended and shortly after Juan Peron's rise to power, Ruth left to tour war-torn Europe early 1946. That spring, she left Europe from London aboard the SS John Ericsson back to New York, entertaining American troops and refugees along the way. She maintained a residence in New York until late 1947, afterwards relocating to Los Angeles, California where she eventually passed away, at some unknown date, although it's believed to be sometime during the late-1950s.\n\n"}

{"id": "462949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=462949", "title": "Schnorrer", "text": "Schnorrer\n\nSchnorrer (שנאָרער; also spelled shnorrer) is a Yiddish term meaning \"beggar\" or \"sponger\". The word \"Schnorrer\" also occurs in German to describe a freeloader who frequently asks for little things, like cigarettes or little sums of money, without offering a return. The English usage of the word denotes a sly chiseler who will get money out of his acquaintances any way he can, often through an air of entitlement. A \"schnorrer\" is distinguished from an ordinary beggar by dint of his boundless chutzpah. Like \"moocher\", \"schnorrer\" does not apply to direct begging or destitution, but rather a habit of getting things (food, tools) by politely or insistently borrowing them with no intention of return.\n\nThe term, which is used in a pejorative or ironic sense, can also be used as a backhanded compliment to someone's perseverance, cleverness, or thrift. For instance, Azriel Hildesheimer, known for his travels around Europe to spread his rabbinical wisdom to the poor, and for his refusal to accept payment for his services, was sometimes referred to as the \"international \"schnorrer\"\" for his reliance on the local community to house and feed him wherever he went. Alternatively, Theodor Herzl described his early Eastern European immigrant supporters among the \"Ostjuden\", as his \"army of \"schnorrers\"\". Israel Zangwill later described a \"schnorrer\" as a beggar who would chide a donor for not giving enough. The Schnorrer Club of Morrisania was a German-American social club in the Bronx, New York.\n\nSchnorrers sometimes begged for the dowries of poor women (Hakhnasat Kallah); a practice which was allowed even when it disrupted the public study of the Torah.\n\nAdditionally, the word is the origin of the modern Hebrew verb לשנורר (leshnorer), which can be roughly defined as \"getting small things without offering return.\"\n\n"}

It is similar to Spades and Hokm, but bidding and trump are declared in every hand by the bidding winner. Both the name and the point structure of this game are similar to the American game Rook, there being a possible connection between the two games, although it is not clear as from which game it derives.\n\nThe word shelem comes from the French word chelem (slam in English), as used in French tarot, which means winning all the tricks in the round. The term slam is used in trick-taking games such as Bridge, Spades and Whist.\n\nEach player receives 12 cards in batches of 4. The remaining 4 cards form a \"widow\", to be taken up by the player who makes a contract. Starting with eldest hand, the players bid (in multiples of 5) for the privilege of taking up the widow and making trumps. The minimum bid is 100, and there are 165 points in the game. A player who does not want to overbid the previous bid may pass, but cannot bid again later in the same round. The highest bidder becomes \"declarer\", takes up the widow, and discards 4 cards face down to return to the original number of cards (12). The discarded pile becomes the declarer's team's first trick (including any points).\n\nDeclarer leads to the first trick. The suit of the card led becomes the trump suit. The remainder of the deal is played according to the standard trick-play rules as in Whist or Hokm. The cards discarded by the highest bidder count for declarer's party as in most comparable games, or for the winner of the last trick as in Rook.\n\nEach party makes the card-points in tricks won plus 5 points for every trick. If declarer's party is successful, they score what they made, or 330 points if they win all tricks (i.e., achieve a shelem or slam). If they are not successful, they lose what they bid, doubled if they make less than their opponents. The opponents always score precisely what they made. There's no penalty for scoring points above the bid amount.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released in December 2008 in Japan, and released in English in Europe and North America in March 2009. The game's development was led by project head Osamu Komuta, who had previously been a planner for \"Suikoden Tactics\", with a music staff composed of Norikaku Miura, Yoshino Aoki, Masaharu Iwata, and Kaori Komuro. The game features the opening and ending theme songs \"Tears in the Sky\" and \"Tierkreis\" respectively, each performed by Japanese pop idol Satomi Takasugi.\n\nCreated as a spin-off of the main series of games, \"Suikoden Tierkreis\" was made to explore one of the myriad of worlds that exist in the \"Suikoden\" metaverse. Following the game's main theme of \"the infinite possibility of future\", players must assume the role of a young protagonist who gathers the combined forces of 108 heroes to attempt to defeat a powerful entity known as The One King, leader of The Order of the One True Way, who seeks to control the world by spreading his doctrine that all fate is predetermined and all people have no control of their lives.\n\n\"Suikoden Tierkreis\" is a traditional JRPG where the player must navigate through three-dimensional environments and complete story-based objectives to advance the narrative. Taking advantage of the Nintendo DS' dual screens, gameplay, text, and menu options are often displayed on the bottom screen. On the field, the top screen shows a landscape image of the player's current location, along with the name of that location and season information. During battle the top screen also displays character information such as hit points, magic points, etc. Players move their character through the game using either the directional pad or the stylus wand to take advantage of the DS' touchscreen function. While advancing through the game, the player must interact with non-player characters to move the story forward and allow new scenarios to become available for play, as well as to discover new items and areas.\n\nDuring gameplay, players will randomly encounter enemy creatures every few steps while in hostile areas. Battles in \"Suikoden Tierkreis\" use a turn-based approach where players input commands for all active characters in their party before each combat round, with the corresponding actions taking place in accordance with each character's \"speed\" rating. A player's party may consist of up to four characters at a time, with special combination skills becoming available depending on which specific characters are included. When a player defeats a group of enemies, they are awarded experience points that go toward increasing their party member's levels, thereby making them stronger and able to use more special skills in battle. Defeated enemies may also provide trade items that can be sold for money to purchase goods in-game such as restorative items and better equipment that will allow the player to battle even stronger enemies. By using the DS' Wi-Fi function, two players each with their own game card can connect to each other to exchange characters and items, as well as gain access to unique battle scenarios.\n\nThe game is set in a world with several diverse nations and tribes and inhabited by a range of creatures including humans, Roar (similar to the Kobolds and Nay-Kobolds of previous games), Porpos-kin (small, penguin/dolphin like creatures), and Auster (a race of horned giants).\n\nThe game opens as the leader of 108 heroes engages the main antagonist known as \"The One King\" in battle. It is currently unknown whether the defeat shown in the introduction precedes the game or if the game is actually a flashback leading to that scene. The game is set in a parallel world to the main world of the series, which is one of the many worlds in the Suikoden multiverse, known collectively as the Infinity.\n\nThe protagonist is an energetic young man from Citro Village who eventually ends up fighting a mysterious organization that preaches a fatalist philosophy in which the future is predetermined.\n\nThe concept of the Infinity has been previously explored in other Suikoden games: monsters from another dimension are summoned by Windy and Leknaat in \"Suikoden I\", and by Luc and Sarah in \"Suikoden III\"; Nash Latkje, Humphrey Mintz, and Futch visit \"The World of Wings and Scales\" in \"Suikogaiden II\", a parallel world where only dragons exist, while dragons are only able to exist in the main \"Suikoden\" world via the Dragon Rune, one of the 27 True Runes; the Fog Ship Guide, who appears in \"Suikoden IV\", hails from another world; and the final battle of \"Suikoden Tactics\" takes place in the \"World of Emptiness\", a parallel world from which monsters are summoned. Additionally, it is implied that recurring characters Viki, Yuber, and Pesmerga likely come from parallel worlds.\n\nThe player takes on the role of an unnamed character from Citro Village. Events in the game lead to the hero working to assemble the 108 heroes to oppose the powerful, cult-like society called The Order of the One True Way, which tries to force its principles on other nations under the mantra of \"One World! One Future!\" The leader of the Order intends to summon the being known as The One King with the power of the Chronicles, memories of different worlds, in hopes of becoming part of The One King's world, where everything is predetermined.\n\nNo characters from previous installments of the \"Suikoden\" series return for \"Tierkreis\".\n\n\"Suikoden Tierkreis\" was directed by Osamu Komuta, who had previously served as a programmer in \"Suikoden IV\" and a planner in \"Suikoden Tactics\". Kazuyoshi Tsugawa, who had penned \"Suikoden V\", also served as head writer. Takahiro Sakiyama, the director of \"Suikoden V\", took part in this game's development as the lead planner.\n\n\"Suikoden Tierkreis\" sold an estimated 40,000 copies in its first day in Japan, with a lifetime total of approximately 174,000 in the region. \"Famitsu Weekly\" gave it a score of one nine, one eight, one nine, and one eight for a total of 34 out of 40; they found the game's story \"fascinating\" and the game itself to have no real shortcomings, stating, \"from the way the story unfolds to the battle system, there are no obvious flaws to be found.\"\n\nThe English version received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN granted the game with an Editor's Choice award. Although the website found the game's overall presentation and production to be good, they felt longtime fans of the series may find it too different, commenting that \"Suikoden Tierkreis may not be a pocket-sized representation of what hardcore series fans have grown to love, but it’s still one of the deepest and fully produced RPGs on the system, and a serious showpiece.\" Editors at \"Nintendo Power\" conversely found fault with the game's core gameplay and simple battle system, but still found it to have a good storytelling technique, remarking that \"As much as [I] grumble about its flaws, Tierkreis's epic scope and engaging narrative did keep [me] playing, eager to see what would happen next.\" GameSpot called the game \"a brisk, beautiful role-playing experience\", commenting on the game's \"fantastic\" visuals and music but panning the main character's \"atrocious\" English voice acting and lack of initial Wi-Fi support until the player is well into the game.\n\n"}

R. R. Tolkien. It was developed at Beam Software by Philip Mitchell and Dr. Veronika Megler and published by Melbourne House. It was later converted to most home computers available at the time including the Commodore 64, BBC Micro and Oric computers. By arrangement with the book publishers, a copy of the book was included with each game sold.\n\nThe parser was very advanced for the time and used a subset of English called \"Inglish\". When it was released most adventure games used simple verb-noun parsers (allowing for simple phrases like 'get lamp'), but Inglish allowed one to type advanced sentences such as \"ask Gandalf about the curious map then take sword and kill troll with it\". The parser was complex and intuitive, introducing pronouns, adverbs (\"viciously attack the goblin\"), punctuation and prepositions and allowing the player to interact with the game world in ways not previously possible.\n\nMany locations are illustrated by an image, based on originals designed by Kent Rees. On the tape version, to save space, each image was stored in a compressed format by storing outline information and then flood filling the enclosed areas on the screen. The slow CPU speed meant that it would take up to several seconds for each scene to draw. The disk-based versions of the game used pre-rendered, higher-quality images.\n\nThe game has an innovative text-based physics system, developed by Veronika Megler. Objects, including the characters in the game, have a calculated size, weight, and solidity. Objects can be placed inside other objects, attached together with rope and damaged or broken. If the main character is sitting in a barrel and this barrel is then picked up and thrown through a trapdoor, the player would go through.\n\nUnlike other works of interactive fiction, the game is also in real time, insofar as a period of idleness causes the \"WAIT\" command to be automatically invoked and the possibility of events occurring as a result. This can be suppressed by entering the \"PAUSE\" command, which stops all events until a key is pressed.\n\nThe game has a cast of non-player characters (NPCs) entirely independent of the player and bound to precisely the same game rules. They have loyalties, strengths, and personalities that affect their behaviour and cannot always be predicted. The character of Gandalf, for example, would roam freely around the game world (some fifty locations), picking up objects, getting into fights and being captured.\n\nThe volatility of the characters, coupled with the rich physics and impossible-to-predict fighting system, enabled the game to be played in many different ways, though this would also lead to problems (such as an important character being killed early on). There are numerous possible solutions and with hindsight, the game might be regarded as one of the first examples of emergent gameplay. This also resulted, however, in many bugs; for example, during development Megler found that the animal NPCs killed each other before the player arrived. The game's documentation warned that \"Due to the immense size and complexity of this game it is impossible to guarantee that it will ever be completely error-free\". Melbourne House issued a version 1.1 with some fixes, but with another bug that resulted in the game being unwinnable, forcing it to release version 1.2, and the company never fixed all bugs.\n\n\"The Hobbit\" was a bestseller in the UK on the ZX Spectrum in 1983 and both the C64 and BBC the following year. The game won the 1983 Golden Joystick Award for best strategy game. The game was also a huge commercial success, selling over 100,000 copies in its first two years at a retail price of £14.95. There are no records of sales figures but in an article from March 1985 it was estimated in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 and a figure of 500,000 copies is possible, making it an \"excellent candidate for the bestselling text adventure of all time, challenged, if at all, only by Infocom’s \"Zork I\"\". The use of images on many of the locations as opposed to mostly text-only adventure games of the time, the flexibility of the \"Inglish\" parser, the innovative independence of the non-player characters, the popularity of Tolkien's work, all attributed to the game's phenomenal success.\n\nTo help players a book called \"A guide to playing The Hobbit\" by David Elkan was published in 1984.\n\nDeveloper Beam Software followed up \"The Hobbit\" with 1985's \"\", 1987's \"Shadows of Mordor: Game Two of Lord of the Rings\", and 1989's \"The Crack of Doom\". They would also reuse Inglish in \"Sherlock\".\n\nIn 1986 a parody of the game was released by CRL, \"The Boggit\".\n\nA phrase from the game which has entered popular culture is \"Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold.\"\n\nAlso, the game is mentioned in Nick Montfort's, \"Twisty Little Passages\", a book exploring the history and form of the interactive fiction genre.\n\n\"Discworld Noir\" references \"The Hobbit\": when the protagonist, Lewton, discovers that someone concealed themselves in a wine barrel, he wonders why that brings to mind the phrases \"You wait – time passes\" and \"Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "30802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30802", "title": "Tragedy of the commons", "text": "Tragedy of the commons\n\nThe tragedy of the commons is a term used in social science to describe a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action. The concept and phrase originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (also known as a \"common\") in Great Britain and Ireland. The concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the American ecologist and philosopher Garrett Hardin in 1968. In this modern economic context, commons is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere, oceans, rivers, fish stocks, or even an office refrigerator.\n\nIt has been argued that the very term 'tragedy of the Commons' is a misnomer, since 'the commons' referred to land resources with rights jointly owned by members of a community, and no individual outside the community had any access to the resource. However, the term is now used in social science and economics when describing a problem where \"all\" individuals have equal and open access to a resource. Hence, 'tragedy of open access regimes' or simply 'the open access problem' are more apt terms.\n\nThe 'tragedy of the commons' is often cited in connection with sustainable development, meshing economic growth and environmental protection, as well as in the debate over global warming. It has also been used in analyzing behavior in the fields of economics, evolutionary psychology, anthropology, game theory, politics, taxation and sociology.\n\nAlthough common resource systems have been known to collapse due to overuse (such as in over-fishing), many examples have existed and still do exist where members of a community with access to a common resource co-operate or regulate to exploit those resources prudently without collapse. Elinor Ostrom was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for demonstrating exactly this concept in her book Governing the Commons, which included examples of how local communities were able to do this without top-down regulations.\n\nIn 1833, the English economist William Forster Lloyd published a pamphlet which included a hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource. This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, as was the custom in English villages. He postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common, overgrazing could result. For each additional animal, a herder could receive additional benefits, but the whole group shared damage to the commons. If all herders made this individually rational economic decision, the common could be depleted or even destroyed, to the detriment of all.\n\nIn 1968, ecologist Garrett Hardin explored this social dilemma in his article \"The Tragedy of the Commons\", published in the journal \"Science\". The essay derived its title from the pamphlet by Lloyd, which he cites, on the over-grazing of common land.\n\nHardin discussed problems that cannot be solved by technical means, as distinct from those with solutions that require \"a change only in the techniques of the natural sciences, demanding little or nothing in the way of change in human values or ideas of morality\". Hardin focused on human population growth, the use of the Earth's natural resources, and the welfare state. Hardin argued that if individuals relied on themselves alone, and not on the relationship of society and man, then the number of children had by each family would not be of public concern. Parents breeding excessively would leave fewer descendants because they would be unable to provide for each child adequately. Such negative feedback is found in the animal kingdom. Hardin said that if the children of improvident parents starved to death, if overbreeding was its own punishment, then there would be no public interest in controlling the breeding of families. Hardin blamed the welfare state for allowing the tragedy of the commons; where the state provides for children and supports overbreeding as a fundamental human right, Malthusian catastrophe is inevitable. Consequently, in his article, Hardin lamented the following proposal from the United Nations:\nIn addition, Hardin also pointed out the problem of individuals acting in rational self-interest by claiming that if all members in a group used common resources for their own gain and with no regard for others, all resources would still eventually be depleted. Overall, Hardin argued against relying on conscience as a means of policing commons, suggesting that this favors selfish individuals – often known as free riders – over those who are more altruistic.\n\nIn the context of avoiding over-exploitation of common resources, Hardin concluded by restating Hegel's maxim (which was quoted by Engels), \"freedom is the recognition of necessity\". He suggested that \"freedom\" completes the tragedy of the commons. By recognizing resources as commons in the first place, and by recognizing that, as such, they require management, Hardin believed that humans \"can preserve and nurture other and more precious freedoms\".\n\nHardin's article was the start of the modern use of \"Commons\" as a term connoting a shared resource. As Frank van Laerhoven & Elinor Ostrom have stated: \"Prior to the publication of Hardin’s article on the tragedy of the commons (1968), titles containing the words 'the commons', 'common pool resources,' or 'common property' were very rare in the academic literature.\" They go on to say: \"In 2002, Barrett and Mabry conducted a major survey of biologists to determine which publications in the twentieth century had become classic books or benchmark publications in biology. They report that Hardin’s 1968 article was the one having the greatest career impact on biologists and is the most frequently cited\".\n\nLike Lloyd and Thomas Malthus before him, Hardin was primarily interested in the problem of human population growth. But in his essay, he also focused on the use of larger (though finite) resources such as the Earth's atmosphere and oceans, as well as pointing out the \"negative commons\" of pollution (i.e., instead of dealing with the deliberate privatization of a positive resource, a \"negative commons\" deals with the deliberate commonization of a negative cost, pollution).\n\nAs a metaphor, the tragedy of the commons should not be taken too literally. The \"tragedy\" is not in the word's conventional or theatric sense, nor a condemnation of the processes that lead to it. Similarly, Hardin's use of \"commons\" has frequently been misunderstood, leading him to later remark that he should have titled his work \"The Tragedy of the Unregulated Commons\".\n\nThe metaphor illustrates the argument that free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation, temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while the costs of the exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptiveness of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.\n\nThe same concept is sometimes called the \"tragedy of the fishers\", because fishing too many fish before or during breeding could cause stocks to plummet.\n\nThe \"tragedy of the commons\" can be considered in relation to environmental issues such as sustainability. The commons dilemma stands as a model for a great variety of resource problems in society today, such as water, forests, fish, and non-renewable energy sources such as oil and coal.\n\nSituations exemplifying the \"tragedy of the commons\" include the overfishing and destruction of the Grand Banks, the destruction of salmon runs on rivers that have been dammed – most prominently in modern times on the Columbia River in the Northwest United States, and historically in North Atlantic rivers – the devastation of the sturgeon fishery – in modern Russia, but historically in the United States as well – and, in terms of water supply, the limited water available in arid regions (e.g., the area of the Aral Sea) and the Los Angeles water system supply, especially at Mono Lake and Owens Lake.\n\nIn economics, an externality is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. Negative externalities are a well-known feature of the \"tragedy of the commons\". For example, driving cars has many negative externalities; these include pollution, carbon emissions, and traffic accidents. Every time 'Person A' gets in a car, it becomes more likely that 'Person Z' and millions of others will suffer in each of those areas. Economists often urge the government to adopt policies that \"internalize\" an externality.\n\nMore general examples (some alluded to by Hardin) of potential and actual tragedies include:\n\nA parallel was drawn recently between the tragedy of the commons and the competing behaviour of parasites that through acting selfishly eventually diminish or destroy their common host. The idea has also been applied to areas such as the evolution of virulence or sexual conflict, where males may fatally harm females when competing for matings. It is also raised as a question in studies of social insects, where scientists wish to understand why insect workers do not undermine the \"common good\" by laying eggs of their own and causing a breakdown of the society.\n\nThe idea of evolutionary suicide, where adaptation at the level of the individual causes the whole species or population to be driven extinct, can be seen as an extreme form of an evolutionary tragedy of the commons. From an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide us with advanced therapeutic methods.\n\nThe \"commons dilemma\" is a specific class of social dilemma in which people's short-term selfish interests are at odds with long-term group interests and the common good. In academia, a range of related terminology has also been used as shorthand for the theory or aspects of it, including \"resource dilemma\", \"take-some dilemma\", and \"common pool resource\".\n\nCommons dilemma researchers have studied conditions under which groups and communities are likely to under- or over-harvest common resources in both the laboratory and field. Research programs have concentrated on a number of motivational, strategic, and structural factors that might be conducive to management of commons.\n\nIn game theory, which constructs mathematical models for individuals' behavior in strategic situations, the corresponding \"game\", developed by Hardin, is known as the Commonize Costs – Privatize Profits Game (CC–PP game).\n\nKopelman, Weber, & Messick (2002), in a review of the experimental research on cooperation in commons dilemmas, identify nine classes of independent variables that influence cooperation in commons dilemmas: social motives, gender, payoff structure, uncertainty, power and status, group size, communication, causes, and frames. They organize these classes and distinguish between psychological individual differences (stable personality traits) and situational factors (the environment). Situational factors include both the task (social and decision structure) and the perception of the task.\n\nEmpirical findings support the theoretical argument that the cultural group is a critical factor that needs to be studied in the context of situational variables. Rather than behaving in line with economic incentives, people are likely to approach the decision to cooperate with an appropriateness framework. An expanded, four factor model of the Logic of Appropriateness, suggests that the cooperation is better explained by the question: \"What does a person like me (identity) do (rules) in a situation like this (recognition) given this culture (group)?\"\n\nStrategic factors also matter in commons dilemmas. One often-studied strategic factor is the order in which people take harvests from the resource. In simultaneous play, all people harvest at the same time, whereas in sequential play people harvest from the pool according to a predetermined sequence – first, second, third, etc. There is a clear order effect in the latter games: the harvests of those who come first – the leaders – are higher than the harvest of those coming later – the followers. The interpretation of this effect is that the first players feel entitled to take more. With sequential play, individuals adopt a first come-first served rule, whereas with simultaneous play people may adopt an equality rule. Another strategic factor is the ability to build up reputations. Research found that people take less from the common pool in public situations than in anonymous private situations. Moreover, those who harvest less gain greater prestige and influence within their group.\n\nMuch research has focused on when and why people would like to structurally rearrange the commons to prevent a tragedy. Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that \"Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.\" One of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common. Groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task. Groups prefer leaders who are elected, democratic, and prototypical of the group, and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation. A general aversion to autocratic leadership exists, although it may be an effective solution, possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption.\n\nThe provision of rewards and punishments may also be effective in preserving common resources. Selective punishments for overuse can be effective in promoting domestic water and energy conservation – for example, through installing water and electricity meters in houses. Selective rewards work, provided that they are open to everyone. An experimental carpool lane in the Netherlands failed because car commuters did not feel they were able to organize a carpool. The rewards do not have to be tangible. In Canada, utilities considered putting \"smiley faces\" on electricity bills of customers below the average consumption of that customer`s neighborhood.\n\nArticulating solutions to the tragedy of the commons is one of the main problems of political philosophy. In many situations, locals implement (often complex) social schemes that work well. The best governmental solution may be to do nothing. When these fail, there are many possible governmental solutions such as privatization, internalizing the externalities, and regulation.\n\nSometimes the best governmental solution may be to do nothing. Robert Axelrod contends that even self-interested individuals will often find ways to cooperate, because collective restraint serves both the collective and individual interests. Anthropologist G. N. Appell criticized those who cited Hardin to \"impos[e] their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge.\"\n\nPolitical scientist Elinor Ostrom, who was awarded 2009's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her work on the issue, and others revisited Hardin's work in 1999. They found the tragedy of the commons not as prevalent or as difficult to solve as Hardin maintained, since locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves. For example, it was found that a commons in the Swiss Alps has been run by a collective of farmers there to their mutual and individual benefit since 1517, in spite of the farmers also having access to their own farmland. In general, it is in the users of a commons interests to keep the common running and complex social schemes are often invented by the users for maintaining them at optimum efficiency.\n\nSimilarly, geographer Douglas L. Johnson remarks that many nomadic pastoralist societies of Africa and the Middle East in fact \"balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in ways that were ecologically sound\", reflecting a desire for lower risk rather than higher profit; in spite of this, it was often the case that \"the nomad was blamed for problems that were not of his own making and were a product of alien forces.\" Independently finding precedent in the opinions of previous scholars such as Ibn Khaldun as well as common currency in antagonistic cultural attitudes towards non-sedentary peoples, governments and international organizations have made use of Hardin's work to help justify restrictions on land access and the eventual sedentarization of pastoral nomads despite its weak empirical basis. Examining relations between historically nomadic Bedouin Arabs and the Syrian state in the 20th century, Dawn Chatty notes that \"Hardin's argument […] was curiously accepted as the fundamental explanation for the degradation of the steppe land\" in development schemes for the arid interior of the country, downplaying the larger role of agricultural overexploitation in desertification as it melded with prevailing nationalist ideology which viewed nomads as socially backward and economically harmful.\n\nElinor Ostrom, and her colleagues looked at how real-world communities manage communal resources, such as fisheries, land irrigation systems, and farmlands, and they identified a number of factors conducive to successful resource management. One factor is the resource itself; resources with definable boundaries (e.g., land) can be preserved much more easily. A second factor is resource dependence; there must be a perceptible threat of resource depletion, and it must be difficult to find substitutes. The third is the presence of a community; small and stable populations with a thick social network and social norms promoting conservation do better. A final condition is that there be appropriate community-based rules and procedures in place with built-in incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse. When the commons is taken over by non-locals, those solutions can no longer be used.\n\nGovernmental solutions may be necessary when the above conditions are not met (such as a community being too big or too unstable to provide a thick social network). Examples of government regulation include privatization, regulation, and internalizing the externalities.\n\nOne solution for some resources is to convert common good into private property, giving the new owner an incentive to enforce its sustainability. Libertarians and classical liberals cite the tragedy of the commons as an example of what happens when Lockean property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government. They argue that the solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource, that is, to privatize it.\n\nIn England, this solution was attempted in the Inclosure Acts.\n\nIn a typical example, governmental regulations can limit the amount of a common good that is available for use by any individual. Permit systems for extractive economic activities including mining, fishing, hunting, livestock raising and timber extraction are examples of this approach. Similarly, limits to pollution are examples of governmental intervention on behalf of the commons. This idea is used by the United Nations Moon Treaty, Outer Space Treaty and Law of the Sea Treaty as well as the UNESCO World Heritage Convention which involves the international law principle that designates some areas or resources the Common Heritage of Mankind.\n\nIn Hardin's essay, he proposed that the solution to the problem of overpopulation must be based on \"mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon\" and result in \"relinquishing the freedom to breed\". Hardin discussed this topic further in a 1979 book, \"Managing the Commons,\" co-written with John A. Baden. He framed this prescription in terms of needing to restrict the \"reproductive right\", to safeguard all other rights. Several countries have a variety of population control laws in place.\n\nGerman historian Joachim Radkau thought Hardin advocates strict management of common goods via increased government involvement or international regulation bodies. An asserted impending \"tragedy of the commons\" is frequently warned of as a consequence of the adoption of policies which restrict private property and espouse expansion of public property.\n\nPrivatization works when the person who owns the property (or rights of access to that property) pays the full price of its exploitation. As discussed above negative externalities (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving the tragedy of the commons. \"Internalizing the externalities\", in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.\n\nThe environmentalist Derrick Jensen claims the tragedy of the commons is used as propaganda for private ownership. He says it has been used by the political right wing to hasten the final enclosure of the \"common resources\" of third world and indigenous people worldwide, as a part of the Washington Consensus. He argues that in true situations, those who abuse the commons would have been warned to desist and if they failed would have punitive sanctions against them. He says that rather than being called \"The Tragedy of the Commons\", it should be called \"the Tragedy of the Failure of the Commons\".\n\nHardin's work was also criticised as historically inaccurate in failing to account for the demographic transition, and for failing to distinguish between common property and open access resources. In a similar vein, Carl Dahlman argues that commons were effectively managed to prevent overgrazing. Likewise, Susan Jane Buck Cox argues that the common land example used to argue this economic concept is on very weak historical ground, and misrepresents what she terms was actually the \"triumph of the commons\": the successful common usage of land for many centuries. She argues that social changes and agricultural innovation, and not the behaviour of the commoners, led to the demise of the commons. \n\nSome authors, like Yochai Benkler, say that with the rise of the Internet and digitalisation, an economics system based on commons becomes possible again. He wrote in his book \"The Wealth of Networks\" in 2006 that cheap computing power plus networks enable people to produce valuable products through non-commercial processes of interaction: \"as human beings and as social beings, rather than as market actors through the price system\". He uses the term 'networked information economy' to describe a \"system of production, distribution, and consumption of information goods characterized by decentralized individual action carried out through widely distributed, nonmarket means that do not depend on market strategies.\" He also coined the term 'commons-based peer production' to describe collaborative efforts based on sharing information. Examples of commons-based peer production are free and open source software and open-source hardware.\n\nIn certain cases, exploiting a resource more may be a good thing. Carol M. Rose, in a 1986 article, discussed the concept of the \"comedy of the commons\", where the public property in question exhibits \"increasing returns to scale\" in usage (hence the phrase, \"the more the merrier\"), in that the more people use the resource, the higher the benefit to each one. Rose cites as examples commerce and group recreational activities. According to Rose, public resources with the \"comedic\" characteristic may suffer from under-investment rather than over usage.\n\n\n"}
