{"id": "14061862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14061862", "title": "Adventure education", "text": "Adventure education\n\nAdventure education is the promotion of learning through adventure centered experiences.\n\nAdventure centered experiences can include a wide variety of activities, due to the different ways people experience adventure. Outdoor sports, challenge courses, races, and even indoor activities can be used in adventure education. Adventure education is related to adventure programming, adventure therapy, and outdoor education. It is an active process rather than a passive process of learning that requires active engagement from the learners as well as the instructors. Often adventure education is linked to an incorporation of all five senses within the experiences which can heighten the opportunities for learning and retaining information. The learning experiences within adventure education programs are structured for a potential increase in human performance and capacity. Sometimes the adventure lies more in the journey than the destination. The venture lies in the struggle, not in the prize.\n\nMerriam-Webster defines adventure as \"an undertaking usually involving danger and unknown risks\". Danger is defined as \"exposure or liability to injury, pain, harm, or loss.\" Danger involves two factors which are perils – the origins of injury or the causes of loss, and hazards – the conditions that emphasize the chance of injury or loss. Risk is defined as \"potential loss or injury\". Risk can be described as \"real risk\" or \"perceived risk\" such as bungee jumping; it seems as though there is a high level of risk, but with proper equipment it can be relatively safe. Danger, then is the exposure, or magnitude, of the harm a person may encounter; risk is the probability of that harm. These two variables are filtered through a person's perceptions, which may or may not be accurate.\n\nConsequently, adventure is created through a person's perception of the magnitude of the potential risk, and the probability of loss. An activity with relatively low magnitude but high probability of harm (such as adventure racing or slacklining) may be just as much of an adventure as an activity with relatively high magnitude and low probability of harm (such as sport rock climbing, skydiving, or riding a roller coaster).\n\nAdventure education has many positive outcomes. A meta-analysis of adventure education studies identified forty major outcomes, grouped into the following six categories: leadership, self-concept, academic, personality, interpersonal, and adventuresomeness. Adventure education often employs practical skills that will benefit an individual in areas beyond the activities in an adventure program. There are three theories of transfer in adventure education in which the participant may apply what they learned into future experiences. The first of these theories is \"specific transfer\" – the learner applies the habits and skills learned during an experience to a new and similar experience (e.g. when an individual learns how to belay during a rock climbing experience and then applies that knowledge to rappelling). The second theory is \"nonspecific transfer\" – the learner establishes some common principles acquired through previous experiences and applies them in a new learning situation (e.g. when an individual develops trust through a trust building activity). The third theory is \"metaphoric transfer\" – the learner applies similar underlying principles to other areas and situations (e.g. when individuals utilize teamwork during an activity such as canoeing and later applies it to the workplace or other group experiences).\n\nThere are six categories of program characteristics that contribute to achieving the program outcomes described above. These are the physical environment, activities, processing, the group, instructors, and the participant.\n\nUnfamiliar environments contribute a great deal to program outcomes experienced by adventure education participants. Being in a new environment allows participants to gain new perspectives on familiar environments and gives them the freedom to experiment. An unfamiliar environment also creates some level of anxiety for the participant, as well as creating the perception of risk. Overcoming the challenges presented by unfamiliar environments through the mastery of specific tasks results in positive benefits to the individual, such as increased self-esteem. Positive outcomes are offered by several types of environments, including wilderness, non-wilderness (e.g. ropes-course), or a traditional classroom. However, wilderness is often considered as providing additional benefits to participants, thus being the optimal environmental setting for adventure education programs.\n\nRather than activities themselves, it is the qualities of activities that are responsible for achieving program outcomes. The combination of challenge, mastery, and success in activities is what led to participant growth. Challenges should be holistic in order to maximize positive outcomes. Programs should include mental, emotional, and physical challenges, and encourage concurrent mastery in all three domains. Challenges should also increase incrementally, so as not to overwhelm participants early on in the program but allow them to grow and develop throughout. Activities should be well organized and matched to suit the particular needs and requirements of the participants. The GRABBS model (Goals, Readiness, Affect, Behavior, Body, and Stage of Development) is a good method for matching activities and participants. Success in the activities must be achievable. However, some failure may also be good for participant development. Program participants can learn from their failures to achieve success. Goal-setting is critical to achieving program outcomes, at both the individual and group levels. It is also important to allow participants to have personal choice related to activities. The \"challenge-by-choice\" philosophy of adventure programming allows the participant to have some autonomy related to the activities s/he participates in.\n\nWhile the qualities of activities are most important in achieving program outcomes, there are also specific activities that are well-suited to adventure programming. These include activities related to trust and empathy (e.g. trust falls), communication, decision-making and problem solving, social responsibility, and personal responsibility.\n\nProcessing is defined as \"the sorting and ordering of information\" that enables program participants to internalize meaning gained from an adventure education experience Three models have been identified by which participants process meaning. In the \"Mountains Speak for Themselves\" model, participants are responsible for reflecting on their experiences on their own, without facilitation from the instructor. In the \"Outward Bound Plus\" model, the instructor serves as a counselor, facilitator, and discussion leader. In the metaphoric model, activities are consciously framed so that they become experiential metaphors that can be applied to challenges in participants' daily lives.\n\nSeveral characteristics of the group also contribute to achieving program outcomes. In terms of the size of the group, small groups of seven to fifteen individuals are usually more conducive to achieving desired outcomes. Reciprocity within the group is also important. This refers to group members learning to cooperate with one another and capitalize on the strengths of each individual. Autonomy of individuals and personal relationships are other aspects of the group that contribute to achievement.\n\nCertain aspects of program instructors such as biographical characteristics, personality, and interpersonal interactions can have a large influence on participants' achievement of desired program outcomes. Instructors may be required to have a Bachelors Degree in Outdoor Leadership to instruct at most Universities and community colleges. Instructors may also be required to hold certain certifications in Wilderness First Responder , American Mountain Guides Single Pitch Instructor and American Canoe Association Whitewater Instructor Certification, among many others.\n\nThe age, gender, background, and expectations of program participants have also been shown to be related to the achievement of program outcomes. Depending on the program a student is in, the program may require the student to be autonomous during expeditionary courses. Student autonomy can be beneficial to students by enhancing personal growth, an increase in self-reliance, and enhancing the overall group experience. However, student autonomy is considered to be controversial in regards to outdoor adventure educational programs, due to risk management concerns. Yet, it is recommended that the instructors of these types of programs must fully understand the risks of student autonomy prior to implementing them as part of an adventure education program.\n\nAdventure education programming can be implemented in several contexts, including therapy for youth at risk, survivors of sexual assault, families in distress, persons with medical conditions, and Veteran assimilation back to civilian life \n\nMany vocational institutes offer training and courses in adventure education. There exists also universities offering degree programs in adventure and outdoor education: \n\nFinland: Humak University of Applied Sciences is offering a 210 ECTS bachelor's degree programme in Adventure and Outdoor Education (Community Educator, Bachelor of Humanities).\n\nNew Zealand: Auckland University of Technology is offering a bachelor's degree in Sport and Recreation - Outdoor Education.\n\nUnited Kingdom: University of Chichester has been running its adventure education degree since 2000.\n\nUSA: Plymouth State University in Plymouth, New Hampshire offers a Bachelors of Science in Adventure Education.\n\nUSA: Oregon State University in Corvallis and Bend, Oregon offers a Bachelor of Science in Tourism Recreation and Adventure Leadership. \n\n"}
{"id": "37020009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37020009", "title": "Bait 3D", "text": "Bait 3D\n\nBait 3D is an Australian-Singaporean 3D horror disaster film directed by Kimble Rendall based on the screenplay by John Kim and Russell Mulcahy. It featured Sharni Vinson, Phoebe Tonkin, Xavier Samuel, Julian McMahon, Cariba Heine, Alex Russell, Lincoln Lewis, Alice Parkinson, and Dan Wyllie. The film was released on 20 September 2012 in Australia.\n\nThe movie opens with a hungover lifeguard, Josh (Xavier Samuel) being woken up by friend and fellow lifeguard Rory (Richard Brancatisano). Rory tells Josh that he shouldn't have proposed to his sister, Tina (Sharni Vinson) then offers to set a buoy for Josh. Josh visits Tina, who discusses their upcoming move to Singapore. As Rory boards into the ocean to set a buoy, a shark appears and kills a man in the water. Alerted to the danger, Josh quickly takes a jet ski and goes to get Rory, but is too late. As Rory is pulled into the water, and Josh is unable to save him before he is devoured.\n\nA year later, Josh now works for a supermarket. While stocking shelves with Naomi (Alice Parkinson) he sees Tina with her new boyfriend Steven (Qi Yuwu) returned from Singapore. At the same time two teenagers, Kyle (Lincoln Lewis) and Heather (Cariba Heine) are parked for a make-out session, accompanied by Heather's dog, Bully. In the supermarket a young girl, Jaime (Phoebe Tonkin) is caught shoplifting, and temporarily evades the security guard by meeting up with her boyfriend Ryan (Alex Russell) who also works at the store. The store manager, Jessup (Adrian Pang) catches up with her, fires Ryan, and calls the police. The arresting officer, Todd (Martin Sacks) arrives, and is revealed to be Jaime's dad. After this, Jessup is held at gun point by a robber, Doyle (Julian McMahon). The tense situation eventually escalates, and Doyle's partner appears and shoots assistant manager Julie (Rhiannon Dannielle Pettett).\n\nAt the height of the commotion, a tsunami wave descends on the city and floods the supermarket. Doyle's partner is killed by the flood, and the survivors injured, forcing them to take shelter on top of the shelving units in the store. As the survivors try to find a way out the security guard is dragged under water. It becomes apparent that a great white shark has been washed into the store by the tsunami. Additionally, a broken wire threatens to electrocute them all. Steven volunteers to shut off the power, and the others dress him in crude armor made of shopping carts and shelves to protect him from the shark. He succeeds but loses his oxygen tube and drowns. Despite their previous conflicts, the survivors work together to get Jessup into a ventilation shaft to go for help. A flood of crabs slides out of the vent, startling Jessup and causing him to fall back, however, he manages to grab hold of the vent. Unfortunately, the shark jumps out of the water and eats Jessup.\n\nIn the parking garage, Kyle, Heather, and Ryan have been cut off from the others, surviving the flooding of the car park as their cars were sealed when the water hit and they thus escaped the initial water damage. Ryan helps the couple escape from their drowned car, but a second great white shark is revealed. Kyle ditches the dog, Bully at the last second and they manage to get to temporary safety. After several unsuccessful attempts at luring the shark away, Ryan decides to join them on top of his flipped van, but the shark gives chase. Ryan successfully gets onto the flipped van but Kyle falls and is devoured.\n\nInside the supermarket, the remaining group make a plan to catch their shark so they can swim to safety. Jaime manages to swim to the butcher section and grab a hook with meat to use as bait. The shark does not go for the bait, so fellow survivor, Kirby (Dan Wyllie) grabs a hook and puts it through Naomi's shirt, using her as bait. Kirby is revealed to be Doyle's partner, who changed out of his clothes and mask so the others wouldn't know he was the murderer. Doyle stabs Kirby with a makeshift harpoon, and throws him into the water with the hook. Naomi is pulled from the water as the shark devours Kirby, catching its jaw on the hook and ensnaring itself in the trap. Josh apologizes to Tina, feeling guilt over her brother's death, but Tina reassures him and kisses him.\n\nBelow, Bully is found alive. Heather's newfound hope inspires Ryan to start banging on the pipes, calling for help. Jaime hears Ryan' call and with Josh goes to rescue him. Below, they are alerted to the second shark's presence. Josh and Jaime find her dad's car, in which are a shotgun and taser. Josh kills the shark with the shotgun, and the four of them get back into the supermarket. A tremor strikes as they are all swimming to the entrance, breaking the first shark loose. Josh kills the shark with the taser as Doyle wires a truck jammed in the entrance to explode, breaking a hole in the debris and freeing them. The survivors leave the supermarket, reaching the severely damaged city, and Tina asks Josh what to do now. At sea, a seagull swoops low over the water, and a shark jumps out and devours it.\n\n\nInitially, Russel Mulcahy was going to direct the film; however, his involvement with the television series \"Teen Wolf\" made this impractical, and so he hired Kimble Rendall to direct instead. The film began shooting on 29 November 2011. Three animatronic sharks were used for filming. Although Rendall wanted to entirely avoid using computer-generated imagery, the budget negated that some scenes required its use.\n\n\"Bait\" had its premiere at the Venice Film Festival where it was shown out of competition on 1 September 2012. The film was released theatrically on 20 September 2012 Australia and on 29 November 2012 in Singapore.\n\nThe film was released on DVD in Australia on 16 January 2013 without the \"3D\" subtitle as \"Bait\"; it was only released in 3D on Blu-ray.\n\nThe film received a 47% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews. Margaret Pomeranz rated the film 3.5/5 stars and said it would appeal to a specific genre audience, while David Stratton rated it 2.5/5 stars and criticized the film for not investing the audience in its characters. Others, such as Jake Wilson of \"The Age\", saw it as a film that is somewhat enjoyable on the basis of being an \"awful\" film.\n\nProduction of a sequel called \"Deep Water\", about a plane en route from China to Australia crashing in the Pacific Ocean, was suspended in March 2014 due to \"uncomfortable similarities\" to the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.\n\n"}
{"id": "1194387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1194387", "title": "Battlezone II: Combat Commander", "text": "Battlezone II: Combat Commander\n\nBattlezone II: Combat Commander, often abbreviated to \"BZ2\", is a 1999 computer game released by Pandemic Studios as a sequel to Activision's 1998 \"Battlezone\". Like Activision's \"Battlezone\", \"Battlezone II\" is a hybrid tank shooter, first-person shooter (FPS) and real-time strategy (RTS) game. The player pilots various futuristic vehicles, while using the function keys to select and command units and structures. \"Battlezone II\" features two races, the ISDF (humans) and the Scions. A remastered version was released in March 2018 under the title \"Battlezone: Combat Commander\" on the gaming platforms GOG and Steam.\n\"Battlezone II\" is set in the same alternative history universe as \"Battlezone\". Its plot takes place in 1990s about 30 years after the original story of Battlezone and features an alien invasion theme. America's NSDF (National Space Defense Force) and the Soviet Union's CCA (Cosmos Colonist Army), the foes of the Cold War conflict, were forced to work together in order to combat their common enemy, the Furies. Access to alien technology has necessitated the creation of an international peacekeeping force, the International Space Defense Force (ISDF), whose role is to oversee distribution of the rare \"bio-metal\" resource and mediate disputes between member nations. To prevent the future misuse of bio-metal, the AAN (Alliance of Awakened Nations) is created to oversee the even distribution of the resource between the countries.\n\nAfter several years, General Armand Braddock, former commander of the NSDF's elite Black Dog Squadron, secretly builds a base on Pluto from diverted resources without the knowledge of the AAN, and begins what he dubs 'Project Pedigree'. By fusing human test subjects (the former members of the Black Dogs) with biometal, Braddock is able to create a highly advanced force of powerful and intelligent combatants. However, tired of Braddock's deceit and enraged by what he has done to them, the subjects mount a rebellion and flee into space. Unable to pursue without arousing suspicion, Braddock is forced to monitor the edge of the Solar System, where they also discover a new celestial body, dubbed the \"Dark Planet\" because of its hidden nature, and even build a small facility there as well. Shortly after the loss of the Voyager-2 probe to a missile attack, contact with Cerberus Base on Pluto was lost.\n\nA whole fleet of ISDF troops was dispatched to find out what happened, including Lieutenant John Cooke, whom Battlezone II's storyline revolves around.\n\n\"Battlezone II\" has two alternate endings available to the player:\nJohn obeys his superior's command and destroys the Scion craft. Braddock informs him that Manson and his men survived, but they refused to obey, saying that Braddock is a traitor to the AAN. Cooke inserts a small team under his lead and destroys the base. Manson's body is found at the outskirts of the base. They also find out that Burns has escaped.\n\nFollowing Scion transmissions, they locate the heart of the Scion society, a medium-sized planet called the \"Core\" planet, which is presumed to be artificial. After establishing an outpost, Cooke follows a convoy to a hole in the crust, leading to the planet's interior. He descends, and after dispatching numerous automated defenses, destroys the central crystal, causing the planet to collapse and detonate.\n\nInstead of shooting the Scion as commanded by Braddock, Cooke orders the Tug carrying Burns to follow the Scion. After leading him through an underground tunnel, the Scion confirms that she is Shabayev. She was found by the Scions on Bane after the crash. She explains that Braddock ordered the attack on the drop ships to silence them. He had also ordered the Voyager to be shot down to prevent the AAN from detecting the ISDF base on the Dark Planet. She also reveals to John that the Scions are actually humans who have been fused together with bio-metal. At the core of the Collective are the former members of the Black Dog Squadron. After the uprising, they fled to the Dark Planet, then into the Scion system, where they found the Cthonian ruins on Mire and embraced their culture. Their ultimate goal is not to destroy Earth, but to bring the enlightened Cthonian culture back to humanity.\n\nJohn is transformed into a Scion to better aid their cause. He is informed by Burns that the three machines that were disarmed were called alchemators, and that they did not destroy planets but rather terraformers. The Core Planet is dying, as evidenced by a large number of dead Scions found on Pluto and Dark Planet before. The Scion can only survive if they find a new planet, and the Dark Planet is the ideal candidate.\n\nA routine patrol manages to steal one of the power crystals of the three machines. Shabayev asks John to escort the Hauler towing the power crystal to a nav point where it can be carried away by a Scion dropship. When the convoy arrives at the passage, a landslide occurs, causing them to have to reroute the Hauler. Cooke investigates the other side and sees a departing Scion vehicle. After the incident, Burns requests that John find and return the last two crystals. The second crystal is stolen from a base with a clever tactic: John lures the defenders into an ambush, then shuts down the defenses with a surgical artillery strike on the power generators. When the third crystal is acquired, each is sent to their respective alchemators. However, when he brings the final crystal to Rend, his team is ambushed by a much larger force of rebels who capture the crystal.\n\nBurns receives information that Manson's AAN loyalists (including himself) have defied Braddock and are under siege from his New Regime troops. After breaking the siege, Cooke counterattacks with Manson's forces, destroying the NR base and even intercepting a rebel convoy carrying the crystal which they are willing to trade with Braddock for bio-metal.\n\nWith the last crystal in his possession, Cooke lands on Rend for a final payback. Braddock personally defends the alchemator with a trio of Attila Combat Walkers, but he is ultimately defeated and the crystal is placed. The three alchemators are then activated, and their combined beam is shot through a wormhole into the Solar System. The beam impacts into the Dark Planet, gradually transforming it into a new Core Planet at Earth's doorstep.\n\nPandemic Studios continued and expanded the concept of a RTS and FPS hybrid where the player drives the vehicle in the game, but using a mixture of the reticle and the space bar, selects units and buildings to build and orders units around the battle field. The F keys at the top of the keyboard were used to create groups of units for easy selection of the units presently on the battlefield when they were not in the range of the player to select via the spacebar.\n\n\"Battlezone II\" was not very popular, likely due to Pandemic Studio's attempts to blend two genres together; both styles of player had trouble adapting to an unfamiliar genre. Programmer Ken Miller said, \"\"BZ2\" was meant to do that [appeal to both genres] at first, but headed in the opposite direction. The problem is that mixed-genre games only attract players that like both genres (the intersection) as opposed to either genre (the union). It mainly comes down to learning curve. Action/shooter gamers can pick up just about any action/shooter game on the market and play it in short order, as almost all of them use the same control scheme and feature similar gameplay conventions. Similarly, strategy gamers can pick up just about any strategy game on the market and play it, although strategy games tend to differ from each other more than action games. Confronting an action/shooter gamer with strategy or a strategy player with action tends to force them outside their genre \"comfort zone\" and requires a steeper learning curve. My pithiest, if somewhat unfair, summation is this: 'FPS players don't want to think; RTS players don't want to die.'\"\n\nWhen \"Battlezone II\" was released to the public in January 2000 the game was met with a lot of enthusiasm, but it quickly began receiving negative views because of out-of-the-box bug issues and over the top requirements to run the game for its time. With a multiplayer that was broken and not fixed until patch 1.1 the game received a lot of negative publicity while it was on the shelf.\n\nIn an interview Nathan Mates, a programmer that worked on \"Battlezone II\", attempted to explain why after the first game, \"BZ2\" did not fare well on the market, in an interview with the Battlezone Magazine. \"Despite things not being a huge success at retail, there's a definite, but smaller, portion of the population that likes the FPS+RTS genre. Their options are somewhat limited. So they stick with what they know and love. As I said above [about why Battlezone III was never made], this tenaciousness can really backfire and hurt things – if the \"BZ1\" fans hadn't bashed \"BZ2\" for so long, then there might have been more people exposed to \"BZ2\". I see this with different \"BZ2\" versions – there's an extreme amount of anger directed at anything that changes.\"\n\n\"Battlezone II\" was one of the first few games to begin supporting modifications and was greatly expanded on the release of the unofficial patch 1.3 by Nathan Mates and Ken Miller, two employees of Pandemic Studio who had continued developing the game on their own time. Carey Chico, Art Director on Battlezone II said, \"Well, the goal of all our effort was to provide for a strong mod community to keep the game going. Seems like it's working.\"\n\n\"Battlezone II\" was designed to be able to support player modifications and featured an in-game mapping tool. Existing vehicles can be modified and new vehicles can be created. Weapons, buildings and missions can also be edited.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34232010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34232010", "title": "Cinnamon challenge", "text": "Cinnamon challenge\n\nThe cinnamon challenge was a viral internet food challenge. The objective of the challenge is to film oneself eating a spoonful of ground cinnamon in under 60 seconds without drinking anything, then upload the video to the Internet. The challenge is difficult and carries substantial health risks because the cinnamon coats and dries the mouth and throat, resulting in coughing, gagging, vomiting and inhaling of cinnamon, leading to throat irritation, breathing difficulties, and risk of pneumonia or a collapsed lung.\n\nThe challenge has been described online since 2001, and increased in popularity in 2007, peaking abruptly in January 2014 and falling off almost as sharply through the first half of that year, then tapering off almost to its previous level by 2014. By 2010, many people had posted videos of themselves attempting this challenge on YouTube and other social networking websites. The cinnamon challenge continues to be active, with Twitter mentions peaking at nearly 70,000 per day in January 2012. It is similar to the saltine cracker challenge, which involves ingesting at least six saltine crackers – also known as soda crackers – within 60 seconds without drinking anything, the Gallon challenge, and the Banana Sprite challenge.\n\nThe stunt can be dangerous, as there is a risk of gagging on the cinnamon, especially if it forms a clump and clogs one's airways. Accidental inhalation of cinnamon can seriously damage the lungs by causing inflammation and leading to infection. The usual result of this stunt is \"a coughing, gagging fit involving clouds of cinnamon\" which \"leaves some people gasping for air\". Sometimes those performing the stunt may gag, choke or cough and accidentally exhale the cinnamon through their noses, coating their skin and mucous membranes in cinnamon. As cinnamon is rich in the compound cinnamaldehyde, the challenge often results in considerable irritation, discomfort, burning, or itching of the affected nasal tissue and nostrils. On YouTube, people have been seen \"coughing, choking and lunging for water, usually as friends watch and laugh.\" Vomiting is also known to have occurred.\n\nThe risks can be worse, even fatal. In the first three months of 2012, American poison control centers had received over a hundred phone calls as a result of the cinnamon challenge. A high-school student in Michigan spent four days in a hospital after attempting the cinnamon challenge. Pneumonia, inflammation and scarring of the lungs, and collapsed lungs are further risks. In July 2015 a four-year-old boy died of asphyxiation after ingesting cinnamon.\n\nThe cinnamon challenge was aired on the twelfth series of the reality television show \"Big Brother UK\", in which show participants were to ingest ground cinnamon without the aid of water. Radio programmes have also aired segments of people performing this stunt, and others in the public limelight have been reported as airing the stunt for public display, including NBA players Nick Young and JaVale McGee.\nMany people upload their cinnamon challenge to YouTube. Comedian Colleen Ballinger told \"The Wall Street Journal\" that she took the challenge in character as Miranda Sings, in 2012, to increase her YouTube traffic after hundreds of her fans had asked her to take the challenge. Her video received more than 2 million views, even though it is on a discontinued YouTube channel. Another comedian, GloZell Green, has attracted more than 50 million views with her cinnamon challenge video, in which she uses a soup ladle full of cinnamon instead of the usual tablespoon. \n\nA large group attempt at the cinnamon challenge was held in 2012 at RMIT University in Australia and involved 64 participants in quick succession. In a 2012 episode of the Discovery Channel series \"MythBusters\", each member of the Build Team attempted the challenge. Kari Byron and Grant Imahara failed, while Tory Belleci completed it by tucking his spoonful into his cheek and letting saliva accumulate in his mouth until he could swallow. However, it took him more than 60 seconds to do so.\n\nIn the 2013 episode of \"Chicago Fire\" titled \"Defcon 1\", a cinnamon challenge is held to determine who will get to live in Severide's new apartment. The challenge is abandoned, and the team is reprimanded by the chief. In 2015, Freddie Flintoff took the challenge on \"A League of Their Own\" (S9 ep1), and \"Criminal Minds\" actor Matthew Gray Gubler was recorded taking the challenge unsuccessfully. The challenge is also featured on Fox's \"Family Guy\"s 14th-season opener, \"Pilling Them Softly\", in which Peter Griffin makes numerous attempts.\n\n"}

In summer 1880, upon finishing fourth grade at Ware High School, Emma was sent to Norfolk, Virginia to live with her widowed Aunt Hattie to continue her studies and later attend the Negro Mission College (which opened 1883). But after a few years, her Aunt suddenly died, leaving the young Emma stranded in Virginia with no place to go.\n\nInstead of returning home, Emma caught the next train north, enrolling herself into the Boston Musical Conservatory and finding work as a chambermaid to support herself. Early 1896, Sissieretta Jones arrived in Boston to organize her Black Patti Troubadours, a vaudeville revue featuring Negro operatic singers, dancers and blackface comedians. After opening in Pittsfield, the show traveled to New York City in October. That winter, while performing in Brooklyn, Emma met and married local janitor, Joseph B. Harris. They settled into a small apartment, where they hoped to start a family. She also assisted in bringing several of her relatives up from the South. After the sudden death of their only child, Emma began focusing on her singing career. Due to her staunchly religious parents' disapproval of her career as an entertainer, Emma quit the Black Troubadours and began singing in the Trinity Baptist Church Choir for nearly five years. However, In 1900 she rejoined the entertainment world by joining Theodore Drury's Opera Company.\n\nIn spring 1901, German Impresario, Paula Kohn-Wöllner, approached Emma (and seven other women) to organize a Negro revue Louisiana Amazon Guards. In early May, the show arrived in Germany and rehearsed and opened in Leipzig before touring across Germany that summer. That fall, the four-act revue began its European tour, traveling across Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Denmark & Sweden. The show reorganized late-1902, after firing Mrs Kohn-Wollner, the revue relocated to Berlin and continued touring Germany until July 1903, when Mrs. Kohn-Wöllner was rehired and launched the girls on a British tour before opening in Saint Petersburg, Russia early March.\n\nUnfortunately as the troupe immediately dissolved upon arrival, Emma and fellow members, Coretté Alefred and/or Fannie Smith formed the Koretty Kreol duo and opened at the Aquarium Gardens. Shortly afterwards (now as a trio), the women opened in Helsinki's Hotell Fennia before traveling south to appear in Moscow's Aumont Theater, run by the manipulative French director, Charles Aumont. During these first weeks in Russia, Emma learned her lonely husband died back in Brooklyn.\n\nOn January 22, 1905, while the women were appearing in St. Petersburg and attending a party hosted by William Caton (popular American jockey), the women witnessed the Bloody Sunday (1905) riots outside the Tsar's palace and across the city. The trio quickly returned to Moscow that night and performed at the Aumont Theatre until Emma quit the trio sometime in February.\n\nThe following month in Helsinki, now as a solo artist, Emma opened successfully at the Princess Restaurant with her singing and classical dances. After her Finnish appearances, she began an extended Siberian concert tour. While performing in Vyatka, Emma met a handsome, English speaking scientist and museum curator named Baranov. The two quickly became lovers, and Emma joined his Central Russian lecture tour, as he promised they would travel to America together the following year. As they toured the major cities along the Volga river, Baranov held his lectures while Emma would perform. Trains hardly reached many parts of Russia during that period, so much of the journey was using 'troikas' and were often followed by hungry wolves. But soon Emma realized he was a charlatan. Baranov presented her as his singing African savage, manipulating and stealing her money after the show. Arriving in Kazan, Emma escaped, but Baranov reported her to the authorities as a Japanese spy. Emma was thrown in jail until an intervention from the US Consulate in Moscow. Returning to Moscow to meet the Consul Samuel Smith, he was shocked to discover she was a Negro. Realizing she couldn't count on America for further help, Emma decided to remain in Russia. \nTowards the end of the year, Emma ran into an old friend, Baltimore businessman, Harry Leans who was visiting Europe. He offered to fund her first solo tour across Europe. From late 1905-1917, Emma (as Oriedo Galima: the Black Nightingale) toured the Russian Empire, Turkey, Greece, and Egypt singing in Russian, German & French and performing Algerian belly dances in numerous theaters and cabarets. Briefly around 1908, Emma joined Afro-American comedian Edgar H. Jones on one of his many Russian tours.\n\nIn 1911, while touring through the Caucasus mountains, Emma met Russian theater and film director, Alexander Ivanovitch Mizikin who became her business manager. Sometime in 1912-13, the couple married and established a residence in Kharkiv (becoming Emma Richardsovna Mizikina). Alex opened a string of cinemas across the Ukraine (such as the Zerkalo Zhizni Cinema) which featured Russian and American films. Meanwhile, Emma continued her concert tours throughout Russia.\n\nUpon the outbreak of World War I, the couple relocated to Moscow and purchased a 15-room house (12 Kozikhinskiy Ln) in the central part of the city and hired six servants and a personal chauffeur. To supplement extra income as her concert tours had come to a halt, Emma became the madam of an exclusive brothel run out of her home, which served wealthy and aristocratic clientele. In spring 1915, while her husband fought on the front lines, Emma shifted from performing to acting. At the G.I. Libken Studios in Yaroslavl. Emma appeared onscreen in an interesting attempt on Russian soil an American adventure film \"Satan's Woman\" (Zhenshchina Satana), about life within the circus and musichall. Directed by Sigismund Veselovsky and produced through the 'Alians' Film Office {F. Parkhomenko}, the film was released on May 14, 1915. Eventually the film was lost (or censured) after the Bolshevik Revolution. The film however perhaps made Emma the first major black silent film actress in Imperial Russian cinema. Several months later, she appeared in the comedy film \"Legs Up!\" (Nogi Vverkh) produced through the 'Kinolent' Film Office.\n\nEarly 1917, Emma joined the Red Cross, working as a nurse on armored train no.1045 aiding the Red Army across the Ukraine. After the February Land Act was enacted early 1918, Emma moved to a large house (4 Kalanchevskaya Ln) in Moscow's Red Gate district which she turned into a boarding house for visiting American journalists and diplomats, whom she threw large dinners and was kindly referred to by as the 'Mammy of Moscow'. Sometime in March 1918, during a massive rally, Emma was pushed to the front and introduced to Vladimir Lenin, who believed blacks represented the \"ideal Communist\". Shortly afterwards, she was given a government position in the Commissariat of the People's Education, teaching English to government officials in the city of Simbirsk near the Russian front lines on the Siberian Front. In September 1919, the Cheka raided her boarding house, and arrested Emma under suspicion of hiding White Army soldiers. After a few days in Lubyanka Prison, she was released as the government refused to execute a Negro woman.\n\nIn 1920, with her husband now apart of a Soviet film Company, Emma returned to acting appearing in well-received propaganda filled films (which Emma later admitted was really poorly produced). As the Great Famine ravaged central Russia in 1921, Emma joined Col. William Haskell's American Relief Administration aiding the starving population until the end of the famine during the summer of 1923.\n\nAfter divorcing Alexander in 1926, Emma retired from the stage, shared a two-room apartment with one of her former prostitutes and joined the workforce as an interpreter for Proletarsky Trud Silk Mill until 1929 when she became one of the lead speakers for the International Red Aid (MOPR), she traveled Russia giving fiery speeches protesting against racism, singing Spirituals and writing poems for Soviet newspapers.\n\nIn June 1932, Emma was among those who welcomed 21 African Americans (among those was Langston Hughes) who had come to organize and appear in the political anti-racism film \"Black & White\" with the Meschrabpom Film company. Emma was also asked to be a part of the film, due to her acting experience in Russian cinema. During the productions, she gave several powerful speeches at the Park of Rest & Culture in fluent Russian protesting the Scottsboro boys trials in the American South. However, the film never materialized and Emma was given a job with the Moscow Torgsin Store.\n\nIn early 1933, she became chief correspondent for the Stankoimport State Trust. That August, after an interview mentioning a wish to visit the US, took a trip to Latvia to receive an American passport then caught the caught the next ship from Hamburg, back to New York after 32 years living abroad.\n\nHarris spoke across the United States speaking of her success and experiences in Russia throughout the up until 1937. By then she was no longer interested in remaining in the United States and disappeared shortly after writing up the transcript of her biography, many sources claiming she soon died. However, American Communist leader, Homer Smith mentioned that she returned to Russia only to receive permission from the Soviet government in 1945, to return to the US only to die not long after arriving. Emma may have returned to Russia in 1937, but was definitely back in the New York by spring 1940 living with her nephew (a few of her relatives moved to New York just before her arrival in Europe). There she remained, hoping to return to Russia after the war, instead passing away in Brooklyn sometime after 1945.\n"}

{"id": "12285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12285", "title": "Grand Guignol", "text": "Grand Guignol\n\nLe Théâtre du Grand-Guignol (: \"The Theatre of the Great Puppet\") – known as the Grand Guignol – was a theatre in the Pigalle area of Paris (at 20 bis, ). From its opening in 1897 until its closing in 1962, it specialised in naturalistic horror shows. Its name is often used as a general term for graphic, amoral horror entertainment, a genre popular from Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre (for instance Shakespeare's \"Titus Andronicus\", and Webster's \"The Duchess of Malfi\" and \"The White Devil\"), to today's splatter films.\n\n\"Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol\" was founded in 1894 by Oscar Méténier, who planned it as a space for naturalist performance. With 293 seats, the venue was the smallest in Paris.\n\nA former chapel, the theatre's previous life was evident in the boxes – which looked like confessionals – and in the angels over the orchestra. Although the architecture created frustrating obstacles, the design that was initially a predicament ultimately became beneficial to the marketing of the theatre. The opaque furniture and gothic structures placed sporadically on the walls of the building exude a feeling of eeriness from the moment of entrance. People came to this theatre for an experience, not only to see a show. The audience at \"Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol\" endured the terror of the shows because they wanted to be filled with strong “feelings” of something. Many attended the shows to get a feeling of arousal. Underneath the balcony were boxes (originally built for nuns to watch church services) that were available for theatre-goers to rent during performances because they would get so aroused by the action happening on stage. It has been said that audience members would get so boisterous in the boxes, that actors would sometimes break character and yell something such as “Keep it down in there!” Conversely, there were audience members who could not physically handle the brutality of the actions taking place on stage. Frequently, the “special effects” would be too realistic and often an audience member would faint or vomit during performances.\n\nThe theatre owed its name to Guignol, a traditional Lyonnaise puppet character, joining political commentary with the style of Punch and Judy.\n\nThe theatre's peak was between World War I and World War II, when it was frequented by royalty and celebrities in evening dress.\n\nOscar Méténier was the Grand Guignol's founder and original director. Under his direction, the theatre produced plays about a class of people who were not considered appropriate subjects in other venues: prostitutes, criminals, street urchins and others at the lower end of Paris's social echelon.\n\nMax Maurey served as director from 1898 to 1914. Maurey shifted the theatre's emphasis to the horror plays it would become famous for and judged the success of a performance by the number of patrons who passed out from shock; the average was two faintings each evening. Maurey discovered André de Lorde, who would become the most important playwright for the theatre.\n\nDe Lorde was the theatre's principal playwright from 1901 to 1926. He wrote at least 100 plays for the Grand Guignol and collaborated with experimental psychologist Alfred Binet to create plays about insanity, one of the theatre's favourite and frequently recurring themes.\n\nCamille Choisy served as director from 1914 to 1930. He contributed his expertise in special effects and scenery to the theatre's distinctive style.\n\nJack Jouvin served as director from 1930 to 1937. He shifted the theatre's subject matter, focusing performances not on gory horror but psychological drama. Under his leadership, the theatre's popularity waned and, after World War II, it was not well-attended.\n\nCharles Nonon was the theatre's last director.\n\nAt the Grand Guignol, patrons would see five or six plays, all in a style that attempted to be brutally true to the theatre's naturalistic ideals. The plays were in a variety of styles, but the most popular and best known were the horror plays, featuring a distinctly bleak worldview as well as notably gory special effects in their notoriously bloody climaxes. The horrors depicted at Grand Guignol were generally not supernatural; these plays often explored the altered states, like insanity, hypnosis, or panic, under which uncontrolled horror could happen. To heighten the effect, the horror plays were often alternated with comedies.\n\n\"Le Laboratoire des Hallucinations\", by André de Lorde: When a doctor finds his wife's lover in his operating room, he performs a graphic brain surgery, rendering the adulterer a hallucinating semi-zombie. Now insane, the lover/patient hammers a chisel into the doctor's brain.\n\n\"Un Crime dans une Maison de Fous\", by André de Lorde: Two hags in an insane asylum use scissors to blind a pretty, young fellow inmate out of jealousy.\n\n\"L'Horrible Passion\", by André de Lorde: A nanny strangles the children in her care.\n\n\"Le Baiser dans la Nuit\", by Maurice Level: A young woman visits the man whose face she horribly disfigured with acid, where he obtains his revenge.\n\nAudiences waned in the years following World War II, and the Grand Guignol closed its doors in 1962. Management attributed the closure in part to the fact that the theatre's faux horrors had been eclipsed by the actual events of the Holocaust two decades earlier. \"We could never equal Buchenwald,\" said its final director, Charles Nonon. \"Before the war, everyone felt that what was happening onstage was impossible. Now we know that these things, and worse, are possible in reality.\"\n\nThe Grand Guignol building still exists. It is occupied by , a company devoted to presenting plays in sign language.\n\nGrand Guignol flourished briefly in London in the early 1920s under the direction of Jose Levy, where it attracted the talents of Sybil Thorndike and Noël Coward, and a series of short English \"Grand Guignol\" films (using original screenplays, not play adaptations) was made at the same time, directed by Fred Paul. Several of the films exist at the BFI National Archive.\n\nThe Grand Guignol was revived once again in London in 1945, under the direction of Frederick Witney, where it ran for two seasons at the Granville Theatre. These included premiers of Witney's own work as well as adaptations of French originals.\n\nIn recent years, English director-writer, Richard Mazda, has re-introduced New York audiences to the Grand Guignol. His acting troupe, The Queens Players, have produced six mainstage productions of Grand Guignol plays, and Mazda is writing new plays in the classic Guignol style. The sixth production, \"Theatre of Fear\", included De Lorde's famous adaptation of Poe's \"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\" (\"Le Systéme du Dr Goudron et Pr Plume\") as well as two original plays, \"Double Crossed\" and \"The Good Death\" alongside \"The Tell Tale Heart\".\n\nThe 1963 mondo film \"Ecco\" includes a scene which may have been filmed at the Grand Guignol theatre during its final years.\n\nAmerican avant-garde composer John Zorn released an album called \"Grand Guignol\" by Naked City in 1992, in a reference to \"the darker side of our existence which has always been with us and always will be\".\n\nWashington, D.C.'s Molotov Theatre Group, established in 2007, is dedicated to preserving and exploring the aesthetic of the Grand Guignol. They have entered two plays into the Capital Fringe Festival in Washington, D.C. Their 2007 show, \"For Boston\", won \"Best Comedy\", and their second show, \"The Sticking Place\", won \"Best Overall\" in 2008.\n\nThe Swiss theatre company, Compagnie Pied de Biche revisits the Grand Guignol genre in contemporary contexts since 2008. The company staged in 2010 a diptych \"Impact & Dr. Incubis\", based on original texts by Nicolas Yazgi and directed by Frédéric Ozier. More than literal adaptations, the plays address violence, death, crime and fear in contemporary contexts, while revisiting many trope of the original Grand Guignol corpus, often with humour.\n\nRecently formed London-based Grand Guignol company Theatre of the Damned, brought their first production to the Camden Fringe in 2010 and produced the award nominated \"Grand Guignol\" in November of that year. In 2011, they staged \"Revenge of the Grand Guignol\" at the Courtyard Theatre, London, as part of the London Horror Festival.\n\nAlso based in London, Le Nouveau Guignol form the UK's only permanent repertory Grand Guignol company; plays within their current repertoire include French Guignol classics such as \"The Final Kiss\", \"Tics... Or Doing the Deed\", \"The Lighthouse Keepers\", \"Private Room Number Six\" and \"The Kiss of Blood\". However, as their company remit also includes encouraging new writing, they have also staged several new plays in the Grand-Guignol style, including \"Eating For Two\", \"Penalty\" and \"Ways and Means\". Le Nouveau Guignol took part in the London Horror Festival alongside Theatre of the Damned at Courtyard Theatre in November 2011.\n\nThe Grand Guignolers in Los Angeles, California, established in 2007, create and perform traditional Grand Guignol and original works as a 1920s Parisian theatre troupe. Shows are staged as event and draw on multiple forms of traditional physical theatrical genres in new ways including Commedia dell'arte, melodrama, mime, mask, clown, dance, vaudeville, magic, and puppetry. Many shows play with the literal 'big puppet' theme utilizing puppetry at various levels including the Petits Guignolers, a French existentially lewd finger puppet show with Grand Guignol effects. The company paid homage to its namesake by staging a surprise 200th birthday party for Guignol with \"A Grand Guignol Children's Show* (*NOT for Children)\". In addition to evenings of classic Grand Guignol, original productions have included \"A Very Grand Guignol Christmas\" and \"Absinthe, Opium and Magic, 1920s Shanghai\".\n\nIn August to October 2013, the Xoregos Performing Company presented \"Danse Macabre\", a contemporary tribute to Grand Guignol at Theater for the New City in New York City. \"Danse Macabre\" was a program of four plays of psychological and physical terror, one humorous work and a dance, in keeping with Grand Guignol's programming history. The run ended October 27 at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. The playwrights were Dave deChristopher, Jack Feldstein, Dylan Guy, Pamela Scott and Joel Trinidad. Choreographer and Director, Shela Xoregos.\n\nIn November 2014, 86 years after the last show of Alfredo Sainati's \"La Compagnia del Grand-Guignol\", founded in 1908 and which had been the only example of Grand Guignol in Italy, the Convivio d'Arte Company presented in Milan \"Grand Guignol de Milan: Le Cabaret des Vampires\". The show was an original tribute to Grand Guignol, a horror vaudeville with various horror and grotesque performances such as monologues, live music and burlesque, with a satirical black humour conduction.\nWhile the original Grand Guignol attempted to present naturalistic horror, the performances would seem melodramatic and heightened to today's audience. For this reason, the term is often applied to films and plays of a stylised nature with heightened acting, melodrama and theatrical effects such as \"\", \"Sleepy Hollow\", \"Quills\", and the Hammer Horror films that went before them. \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\"; \"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\"; \"What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?\"; \"What's the Matter with Helen?\"; \"Night Watch\" and \"Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?\" form a sub-branch of the genre called Grande Dame Guignol for its use of aging A-list actresses in sensational horror films.\n\n\n"}

The dance is traditionally performed by young men at weddings and parties.\n\nThe halling is a quick (95–106 bpm) dance in or that includes acrobatic, athletic competition between the dancers. Hallingdans can best be described as rhythmic acrobatic dance and consists of a number of steps which requires both strength and softness elation.\nThe dance is associated with the valleys and traditional districts of Valdres and Hallingdal, where it is often referred to as the \"laus\" (loose dance). The term refers to it being danced solo, not in couples (although coupled halling dancing is traditional in the western parts of the country). According to some scholars, the word may refer to the fact that the dance was \"half\" the performance, as the other half was the springar (after the fashion of a Renaissance dance suite).\n\nThe meter of the dance is or of a quite fast (95–106 bpm), sharp quality which calls for an experienced musician. The musician has to give the dancers enough impetus to perform the various challenging moves that are involved in the dance such as the \"nakkespretten\" (neck jump), \"kruking\" (hooked dancing), \"hodestift\" (going over the head) and especially the \"kast\" (throw). The dancer Olav Thorshaug performed hallingdans shows in the United States of America around 1910–1920, incorporating the headspin in his dance.\n\nOne of the dance moves is called \"hallingkast\". In this move, a girl has traditionally held a hat high using a stick or something similar, and the dancer is supposed to kick down the hat. \"Kast\" is seen as the test of strength, which involves kicking a hat that is held about 230 to 280 cm above the floor. Some girls have been able dancers themselves, and known to be as agile as any man.\n\nNoted Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg composed several pieces of music for the halling dance in his \"Lyric Pieces\". The finale of Geirr Tveitt's Piano Concerto No. 5, published in 1954, is described as 'Tempo di Halling'.\n\nThe dance was performed by the Frikar Dance Company to the Norwegian winning contribution for the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, \"Fairytale\", by singer and fiddle player Alexander Rybak.\n\nFrikar Dance Company has toured 29 countries with halling dance the last years. The company's founder and choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård is known as the reinventor of halling, exploring the tradition in meeting with new artistic expressions and arenas as for example in the computer game \"Age of Conan\".\n\n"}

It emphasized truck racing, although it had a mode where the player could deliver cargo. The maps were simple, usually with 2 or 3 routes to reach the destination, and had no traffic model.\n\n\nSimilar to the original, but more of an emphasis on delivery of goods.

Worf transports to the planet and discovers that his brother set up the shield to protect the local villagers.\n\nRozhenko meets with the ship’s senior officers and describes his plan to save one village of the doomed planet by setting up a concealed artificial biosphere. Picard replies that the Federation Prime Directive prohibits interference with the natural development of the Boraalan civilization; it is not for them to decide that one group shall survive while the rest of the planet perishes.\n\nAfter witnessing the atmospheric dissipation extinction event transpire, the crew is puzzled by an unexpected power drain, the origin of which Worf tracks to the Holodeck. His brother has transported the population of the Boraalan village aboard the ship, using the Holodeck to replicate caverns identical to those on the planet, misleading the villagers into thinking they are still on Boraal II.\n\nRozhenko tells Worf and Picard that he believes offering the Boraalan culture a chance of survival is more important than following the Prime Directive.

Worf and Nikolai make peace when Worf accepts that the Boraalan race would not have survived if not for his brother’s unconventional methods. Nikolai assuages Worf by telling him that he is going to stay with the villagers and become the new village chronicler.

{"id": "3172800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3172800", "title": "International Students' Day", "text": "International Students' Day\n\nInternational Students' Day is an international observance of the student community, held annually on November 17. Originally commemorating the Nazi storming of Czech universities in 1939 and the subsequent killing and sending of students to concentration camps, it is now marked by a number of universities, sometimes on a day other than November 17, as a nonpolitical celebration of the multiculturalism of their international students.\n\nThe date commemorates the anniversary of the 1939 Nazi storming of the University of Prague after demonstrations against the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and the killings of Jan Opletal and worker Václav Sedláček. The Nazis rounded up the students, murdered nine student leaders and sent over 1,200 students to concentration camps, mainly Sachsenhausen. They subsequently closed all Czech universities and colleges. By this time Czechoslovakia no longer existed, as it had been divided into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and the Slovak Republic under a fascist puppet government.\n\nIn late 1939 the Nazi authorities in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia suppressed a demonstration in Prague held by students of the Medical Faculty of Charles University. The demonstration was held on 28 October to commemorate the anniversary of the independence of the Czechoslovak Republic (1918). During this demonstration the student Jan Opletal was shot, and later died from his injuries on 11 November. On 15 November his body was supposed to be transported from Prague to his home in Moravia. His funeral procession consisted of thousands of students, who turned the event into an anti-Nazi demonstration. However, the Nazi authorities took drastic measures in response, closing all Czech higher education institutions, arresting more than 1,200 students, who were then sent to concentration camps, executing nine students and professors without trial on 17 November. Historians speculate that the Nazis granted permission for the funeral procession already expecting a violent outcome, in order to use that as a pretext for closing down universities and purging anti-fascist dissidents.\n\nThe nine students and professors executed on 17 November in Prague were:\n\nAn initial idea to commemorate the atrocities inflicted on students in German-occupied Czechoslovakia was discussed among Czechoslovak Army troops in England in 1940. A small group of soldiers, former elected student officials, decided to renew the Central Association of Czechoslovak Students (USCS) which had been disbanded by the German Protectorate in Czechoslovakia. The idea of commemorating the November 17 tragedy was discussed with the British National Union of Students of England and Wales and other foreign students fighting the Nazis from England. With the support of Edvard Beneš, President-in-Exile of Czechoslovakia, the USCS was reestablished in London on 17 November 1940, one year after the events at the Czech universities, with the following members:\nThroughout 1941 efforts were made to convince students of other nations to acknowledge November 17 as a day of commemoration, celebrating and encouraging resistance against the Nazis and the fight for freedom and democracy in all nations. These negotiating efforts were mostly carried out by Zink, Paleček, Kavan and Lena Chivers, Vice President of the NUS. Fourteen countries eventually agreed and signed the following proclamation:\n\n\"We, students of Great Britain and its territories and India, North and South America, the USSR, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, China, Holland, Norway, Poland, Yugoslavia and all free nations, to honour and commemorate the tortured and executed students who were the first to raise their voices to reject Nazi oppression and condemn the occupation of 1939, proclaim November 17 as International Students' Day.\"\n\nThe inaugural meeting was held in London's Caxton Hall on 16 November 1941, with support from President Beneš. The proclamation was read and accepted by all attendees, among them representatives of all governments who were in exile in London. The meeting was presided over by USCS Chairman Paleček; the key speakers were Sergej Ingr, Czechoslovak Secretary of Defence; Lena Chivers and Elizabeth Shields-Collins of the UK; Olav Rytter of Norway; Claude Guy of France, A. Vlajčić representing Yugoslavia. \n\nOn 17 November 1941, members of the USCS Executive Committee had a long audience with President Beneš, and similar meetings with the President took place annually on November 17 throughout WWII. The BBC's Czechoslovakian department prepared a special report for November 17 which was broadcast to occupied Czechoslovakia. Many British universities interrupted their schedule to commemorate the events in Prague two years earlier, by reading the proclamation of November 17. Among them were Manchester, Reading, Exeter, Bristol, Aberystwyth, Leicester, London, Holloway College, Bournemouth, Sheffield, King's College London, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Bangor, Cardiff, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. During the war Oxford University extended assistance to the closed Charles University, allowing dozens of Czechoslovak students in exile to graduate.\n\nIn 1989 independent student leaders together with the Socialist Union of Youth (SSM/SZM) organized a mass demonstration to commemorate International Students’ Day. The students used this 50th-anniversary event to express their dissatisfaction with the ruling Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. By nightfall, what had begun as a peaceful commemorative event turned violent, with many participants brutally beaten by riot police, red berets, and other members of law enforcement agencies. About 15,000 people took part in this demonstration. The only person left lying where the beatings took place was thought to be the body of a student, but in fact turned out to be an undercover agent. The rumour that a student had died due to the police brutality triggered further actions; the same night, students and theatre actors agreed to go on strike. The events linked to the International Students' Day of 17 November 1989 helped spark the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia. \"Struggle for Freedom and Democracy Day\" is today observed as an official holiday in both the Czech Republic (since 2000, following a campaign by the Czech Student Chamber of the Council of Higher Education Institutions) and Slovakia.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall and the resulting crisis within the International Union of Students, celebrations for 17 November were held in only a few countries without any international coordination. During the World Social Forum held in Mumbai, India, in 2004, some international student unions such as the Organization of Caribbean and Latin American Students (OCLAE) and some national unions such as the Italian Unione degli Studenti decided to re-launch the date and to call for a global demonstration on 17 November 2004. Student movements in many countries mobilised again that year and continued observing International Students' Day in following years with the support of the Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions (OBESSU) and the European Students' Union (ESU).\n\nIn 2009, on the 70th anniversary of 17 November 1939, OBESSU and ESU promoted a number of initiatives throughout Europe to commemorate the date. An event was held from 16 to 18 November at the University of Brussels, focusing on the history of the students' movement and its role in promoting active citizenship against authoritarian regimes, and followed by an assembly discussing the role of student unions today and the need for the recognition of a European Student Rights Charter. The conference gathered around 100 students representing national students and student unions from over 30 European countries, as well as some international delegations.\n\n"}

Bubbles\n\nJohn William Sublett (February 19, 1902 – May 18, 1986), known by his stage name John W. Bubbles, was a vaudeville performer. He performed in the duo \"Buck and Bubbles.\" He is also known as the father of \"rhythm tap.\"\n\nSubblett was born in Louisville, Kentucky on February 19, 1902, but soon moved with his family to Indianapolis. There, he formed a partnership with Ford L. \"Buck\" Washington in 1919. Their duo was known as \"Buck and Bubbles.\" Buck played stride piano and sang, and Bubbles tapped along. They were so popular that the duo moved to Manhattan, New York City in September of that year. They played together in the Columbia Theater, the Palace and played with artists Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor and Danny Kaye. They were on the \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1931.\" They also became the first black artists to perform at the Radio City Music Hall. \"Buck and Bubbles\" performed live in the first scheduled 'high definition' television program on November 2, 1936 at Alexandra Palace, London, for the BBC, becoming the first black artists on television anywhere in the world.\n\nThough unable to read music, Bubbles was chosen by George Gershwin to create the role of Sportin' Life in his opera \"Porgy and Bess\" in 1935. Since he didn't understand the music score, Gershwin spent the time to teach it to him as a tap rhythm. Sublett caused some problems because he often made up rhythms which caused confusion with other members of the cast. Sublett performed the role occasionally for the next two decades. In 1963, in a studio recording of \"Porgy and Bess\" featuring Leontyne Price and William Warfield, he performed Sportin' Life's two main arias from the opera, \"It Ain't Necessarily So\" and \"There's A Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon For New York\".\n\nIn 1920 he gave lessons in tap dancing to Fred Astaire, who considered Sublett the finest tap dancer of his generation. In the number \"Bojangles of Harlem\" from \"Swing Time\" (1936) Astaire dresses in blackface as the Sportin' Life character and dances in the style of Sublett while ostensibly paying tribute to Bill Robinson.\n\nSublett appeared in Hollywood films of the late 1930s and 1940s, including \"Varsity Show\" in 1937, \"Cabin in the Sky\" in 1943 and \"A Song Is Born\" in 1948. In later life, he also made television appearances, one of his last being on a musical episode of \"The Lucy Show\", which also guest-starred Mel Tormé and a featured performance on Barbra Streisand's 1967 TV special, \"The Belle of 14th Street\", a tribute to the bygone era of vaudeville.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, John Bubbles toured the war zone with the USO. In 1965, he appeared with Eddie Fisher on a USO tour, visiting many outposts and camps in the early war years. He appeared with Judy Garland in her 1967 concert at the Palace Theatre, singing \"Me And My Shadow.\" That same year, he became partially paralyzed due to a stroke.\n\nIn 1978, John Bubbles spoke at the Variety Arts Theatre in Los Angeles as a participant in a seminar on vaudeville. Someone asked him who the best tap dancer was. Bubbles answered, \"You're looking at him.\" Then he added, \"Honestly, if I had to name the best dancer, it would be Fred Astaire. He could tap. He had a good teacher. But he could ballroom, dance with a partner. All in all, he's the best.\" That same night, Bubbles mentioned that Astaire had brought him into the rehearsal hall to work on \"Bojangles of Harlem\" and John's chops are right there in the number.\n\nHe performed at the Newport Jazz Festival in New York in 1979, which was one of his last public appearances. Sublett died on May 18, 1986, at his home in Baldwin Hills, California.\n\nSublett is known as the father of \"rhythm tap,\" a form of tap dance. Sublett included percussive heel drops in his tap style, as opposed to the tap dancing of Bill Robinson (Bojangles) who emphasized clean phrases and toe taps. Sublett's taps were made to the traditional eight-bar phrase, but allowed for more rhythmic freedom. He blended the improvisational style of jazz music with the traditional techniques of tap to create a unique style and sound.\n\nSublett received the 1980 Life Achievement Award from the American Guild of Variety Artists. He was inducted into the Tap Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nSublett was remembered by many celebrities; his catchphrase, \"Shoot the liquor to me, John Boy,\" has been quoted in songs by several artists, including The Manhattan Transfer, The Ink Spots, and Louis Armstrong. Michael Jackson admired Bubbles' dancing and studied his steps for inspiration. In the mid-1980s Jackson named his beloved pet chimpanzee \"Bubbles\" in memory of John Sublett.\n\n"}

The game was released in early 2010 for the PC, distributed digitally. \n\nThe game takes place in an 18th-century pirate setting in which all of the characters are dogs. The game's story revolves around a sausage dog named Gaius James Rover, who is kidnapped by a crew of pirates, before becoming a pirate himself. The game play, characters, and story are comparable to the \"Monkey Island\" series, which the game makes multiple references to.\n\n\"Jolly Rover\" is a traditional point-and-click adventure game in which players control the character of Gaius James Rover. The player must explore a range of environments, and solve a series of puzzles in order to progress through the game. The majority of the game's controls are performed with the use of the cursor, as the player uses Gaius to travel through different environments, pick up items, combine items, examine objects and converse with various non-playable characters.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Gaius meets and befriends a parrot by the name of Juan Leon. The character of Juan Leon doubles as a hint system throughout the game, as Gaius may ask Juan questions in order to receive subtle hints. The player may also use Gaius to feed Juan crackers in order to receive increasingly stronger hints from the parrot.\n\nThe game is focused on a young and naive British Dachshund named Gaius James Rover who is sailing across the seas to deliver a cargo of Jolly Rover, a brew made of rum spoiled by tobacco to governor Guy DeSilver residing on Groggy Island, a small backwater and haven for pirates. However, James is quickly captured by pirates led by Captain Howell who is the first one to give him the nickname and titular name Jolly Rover. \n\nAfter three weeks in capture, James Rover manages to escape and disguises himself and meets Juan Leon the Parrot, a wisecracking animal sidekick that would serve as the hint system for the game progress. But Jame finds that they have already arrived at Groggy Island and captain Howell simply orders him to roar him into shore.\n\nJames tries to confront Governor DeSilver and accuses captain Howell for trying his cargo but Howell denies it and settles the arrangements with delivering the same cargo of rum that he stole from James. DeSilver then proceeds to threaten a rather desperate and reluctant James to settle the debt of 50 pieces-of-eights by paying him 5 pieces per month or be put in jail and most likely hanged. James agrees the terms reluctantly and is recruited by captain Howell to be their ship cook for making up for the incident and that James disposed of their previous cook earlier.\n\nDuring his quest to make \"Salamagundi\", a favored salad dish for the pirates, James is given by a Dalmatian retired pirate a guide book on Voodoo which will be very useful for the game such as Raise the Dead, Voices of the Dead, Scare Beast and Heat Iron. He also learns that DeSilver was a notorious pirate hunter who betrayed his own brother privateer later known as the legendary pirate Captain Silvereye, the nickname being that he used an eye patch with a silver coin attached to it. After Captain Silvereye mysteriously disappeared, DeSilver semi retired and became governor of Groggy Island, controlling the blackmarket trade with an iron fist. \nTo make matters worse, James sneaks into his office and it is accidentally revealed that the corrupt governor is in league with a sinister voodoo priest by supplying him with human sacrifices (or rather dog sacrifices in this case) in exchange for immortality. \n\nJames completes his task by making the salad dish to the pirates and they have a round of rum. Though reluctant, James toasts his share of rum with the pirates but being extremely light headed, James promptly faints after only one drink.\n\nDuring a dream flashback, it is revealed that when he was a young pup, Jame's father was a famous clown working for a circus and that the young pup promised to have his very own circus one day. James' father proudly encourages his sick son to sleep and walks off to work where it is highly suggested that it was the very same night where James' father was tragically comedic killed from a blow to the groin from an improperly loaded joke cannon.\n\nJames Rover wakes up on Cannibal Island dumped by captain Howell as a distraction to the supposedly cannibals who lives there. However the cannibals is revealed to be an all-female pirate crew led by captain Marianne posing as cannibals to either kill or scare off any intruders, males specially. James disguises and infiltrates the camp where he meets a female cocker spaniel and love interest Clara DeSilver, the daughter of Captain Silvereye. \n\nThe two team up to escape the island since Clara no longer desires to be with her previous crew and arrives to a labyrinth cave where her father's ship The Red Herring is hidden but none of them can really find it. But James uses his voodoo book to hear the ghostly voices and uses it to guide themselves to the ship, but none of them can really sail a ship since the ship needs a crew and James is the son of a clown. James uses the Raise the Dead spell and summons the spirit of Captain Silvereye who takes the ship to Shipwreck Island, Clara's family home.\n\nGuided by the pirate ghost, Clara and James arrive to her home where they find that Clara's ghostly father has finally put into rest near her mother's grave. Clara decides to rest in her room up in the tree house while James Rover decides to search for the treasure that captain Silvereye left behind. After a series of puzzles, James finally reaches his goal but the evil governor DeSilver has followed him behind, intent to kidnap Clara for his own evil purposes. James finally embraces his destiny as Jolly Rover the Pirate and challenges DeSilver... Only to get a sword handle delivered to his head which knocks him out.\n\nOddly enough while he is passed out, James receives a spiritual guidance by his father who states how proud he is with his son even though James regretted to never fulfill his promise to have his own circus while they pass juggling balls to each other. When James asks his father what to do next, he simply says \"think fast!\" and knocks James out and softly says to him to wake up.\n\nJames wakes up and finds himself on a very small island with a simple palm tree and an empty barrel and a hangman's knot. But James manages to lure a sea turtle and ties it to the barrel with the rope and he runs off back to Groggy Island to save Clara from DeSilver and the voodoo priest.\n\nJames infiltrates the secret cave via the governors office where DeSilver is trying to perform a voodoo ritual over to Clara with the voodoo priest but James simply walks in confident, juggling with some red balls. Distracting DeSilver by shouting \"Think fast!\", James throws one of his red balls on a very confused DeSilver who stumbles over the voodoo priest and they both fall over the cliff into a pit of hot boiling water. James rescues Clara, but the volcano starts to increase the hot water. James quickly manages to build up a balloon (though he calls it a Jolly Floater) by using the hot steam and they both fly off just before the steam erupts. They are followed by a shape that looks like DeSilver before he disappeared into the steam. \n\nJames and Clara looks across the sea and witnesses a glorious sunset. The balloon flies from the screen and the credits rolls right after Jolly Rover exclaims \"Oh my!\" at Clara's subtle proposal to further develop their romantic relationship.\n\nThough the game was met with little response, the feedback that it did gain was generally positive. One reviewer citing it as \"strong and original\" and stating that it \"brings some interesting new ideas to the point-and-click adventure genre.\"\n\nIt was given a Metascore of 71, based on 15 reviews\n, and a GameRankings score of 76.35% based on 13 reviews.\n\nVideo game talk show \"Good Game\"'s two presenters gave the game an 8 and 7 out of 10 calling it \"a nice short and sweet experience\" as well featuring amusing gameplay.\n"}

{"id": "53879776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53879776", "title": "La tecnica cubana", "text": "La tecnica cubana\n\n\"La técnica cubana\", often abbreviated as \"técnica\", is a form of Cuban contemporary dance that was founded by Ramiro Guerra Suarez in Cuba in 1959. Unlike other forms of traditional Cuban dance, \"técnica\" fuses many different dance forms together, such as those from Africa, Europe, and North America. It is a highly expressive and robust dance form, incorporating many quick jumps and undulating movements of the torso and pelvis. \"Técnica\" blends a high amount of movement and expression with a degree of synchronization, producing an athletic, theatrical dance form.\n\n\"Técnica\" was founded directly following the 1959 Cuban Revolution. The Revolution was driven by ideas of socialism and a lack of Cuban nationalism, which brought about major change to the political, economical, and social realms of Cuba. The new Castro regime provided funding and government support to expand the arts, and thus técnica, a new revolutionary Cuban dance form was established. The similar timing of \"técnica\"’s birth allowed the dance form to incorporate many revolutionary ideas—boosting Cuban nationalism and providing a sense of national and personal identity for Cubans. \"Técnica\" incorporated this nationalist vision into its dance technique and created a sense of \"cubanidad\", or “Cuban-ness.”\n\n\"La técnica cubana\" was founded in Cuba in 1959 and is intimately linked to revolutionary ideals and social activism. The Cuban Revolution of 1959, led by Fidel Castro, transformed the Cuban economy and enacted a series of progressive social reforms in which wealth was redistributed, health care services became free of charge, and racial boundaries were diminished. Cuban nationalism was on the rise for the first time since before Spanish control. The revolutionary government employed culture as a way to unite the Cuban population and promote nationalism. In keeping with this effort to promote Cuban culture, Castro’s new regime fostered expansion of the arts by encouraged the creation of new art forms. Castro’s government appointed Ramiro Guerra, an accomplished dancer and choreographer, as the director of the Department of Modern Dance, housed within the Teatro Nacional (English: National Theatre) in the Plaza de la Revolución in Cuba.\n\nThe goal of the department was to create a dance group with original repertory that was rooted in an original Cuban contemporary dance style. Guerra and his colleagues thus founded a contemporary dance group, \"Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna\" (English: The National Modern Dance Ensemble) with support from the new Castro regime. This group gave \"técnica\" a mandate and a place to grow and develop. Although the group had the benefit of Guerra’s leadership, it was created with influences from a group of people, including Martha Graham, José Limón, among others. This distinguishes \"técnica\" from other modern dance groups, as most other groups originated and were associated with a specific individual. In this way, \"técnica\" naturally reflected the wide range of Cuban movement intelligence, rather than the sole artistic genius of one person. Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna was officially established in 1959 and held its first show in 1960 at the Teatro Nacional in Havana. The financial support of the revolutionary government contributed to great initial success, as the dancers and creators of técnica did not have to rely on outside jobs for income, finance rehearsal space, or commission compositions. \"Técnica\" was created with the social backing of the new regime and aimed to link the power of dance with Cuban national image. As a result, \"técnica\" was a key component of the intellectual socialist production of the new revolutionary Cuba in 1959. Guerra incorporated nationalist ideals of inclusion into his work by combining academic dance elements with popular traditions on the streets, which he then raised to a national level. This new dance language not only reflected Cuban history and experience, but also provided space to accommodate the rapidly changing culture. Guerra had the dream to bring together groups of dancers from different cultural backgrounds to contribute to the Cuban ajiaco, or stew. His dance company consisted of 12 white and 12 black dancers from both amateur and professional backgrounds of Afro-Cuban dance, nightclub dance, and ballet. \"La técnica cubana\" constantly transcended the boundaries of dance with respect to behavior, culture, and aesthetic. The group that Guerra founded and led for eleven years is presently known as Danza Contemporanea de Cuba and is now led by Miguel A. Iglesias Ferrer.\n\nOne of the critical aspects of the founding of \"la técnica cubana\" was to strengthen national identity and heighten the pride of \"cubanidad\", or ‘Cuban-ness.’ This idea of national identity had its roots in the Cuban Revolution, where one of the major goals was to establish a sense of Cuban nationalism not embraced since the rule by Spain and the United States. The revolutionary regime reinvigorated Cuba’s strong dance heritage in order to provide a unifying factor for the Cuban people. Thus, \"la técnica cubana\" was founded to reflect Cuba’s legendary dance heritage and its diverse population, while regaining a symbol of national identity.\n\nState support for dance in Cuba not only created a new technique and style, but also a sense of identity and value for Cuban dancers; contemporary dance was part of a movement toward Cuban creativity and individuality. The artistic expression of \"técnica\" resonated with the Cuban audience. Ramiro Guerra, known as the founder of \"técnica\", created his choreography “in search of a certain \"cubanía\" in his style of dance.” \"La técnica cubana\" played a crucial role in revitalizing Cuba’s vibrant dance community and was a key contributor to the expanding Cuban national sentiment. The national sentiment of Cuba today is still influenced by the original creation of \"técnica\" and its continued growth throughout the years.\n\n\"La técnica cubana\" is a hybrid of Afro-Cuban dance traditions, European ballet, rumba, flamenco, Cuban nightclub cabaret, and North American dance. The goal in creating \"técnica\" was to establish a distinctly Cuban modern dance form that represented Cuba’s multicultural population.\n\nThe major African dance traditions currently in Cuba are derived from four major African groups: Carabali, Kongo-Angolan, Arará, and Yoruba. African heritage is characterized by dance rituals and orisha worship. Each orisha, or spirit, has his or her own gestures, footwork and rhythms that correspond to Yoruba legends and beliefs. Distinctive features of Afro-Cuban dance traditions, such as movements of the arms and head and presence of vibrant music, are incorporated within \"la técnica cubana. Técnica\" celebrates the vibrant African heritage and fuses aspects of their dance technique into \"técnica\"’s style.\n\nEuropean ballet techniques are also highly prevalent in \"técnica\". European ballet is characterized by big turns, multiple jumps and precise balance. \"Técnica\" dancers are well known for their high jumps and completion of multiple turns across stage, as so are their balletic counterparts. Ballet also boasts a strong lower body foundation, which is coupled with the African-tradition use of the arms and fused into \"técnica\"’s technique. European ballet style is also a key component of the training of \"técnica\" dancers. Ballet, with its international fame, contributes to the style of \"técnica\" alongside Afro-Cuban dance traditions.\n\n\"Técnica\" also included aspects of rumba, a traditionally Cuban dance that arose as a secular genre of Cuban music. The stylistic techniques of the elongated torso and flexed posture in rumba are present in the stance of \"técnica\" dancers: knees are bent and the body is tilted forward from the hips. \"Técnica\" combines the rhythms, chants and posture of rumba and incorporates them into the multifaceted style of \"la técnica cubana\".\n\nInfluences from the Spanish-based Flamenco dance can also be seen in \"técnica\". The vibrant use of the arms and hands in the dance technique of técnica is derived from \"floreo\", flourishes of the hand, and \"port de bras\", arm movement, in Flamenco dance.\n\nThe dance elements and techniques from these strong dance forms are all reflected or subtly referenced in \"técnica\". \"La técnica cubana\" merges a unique blend of indigenous and external dance forms to create a new modern form that is the heartbeat of Cuban dance. It is a hybrid dance form, intertwining many of the dance legacies in Cuba, all while still grounded in the modern, social context of Cuba. \"Técnica\" was created intentionally to reflect the diversity of Cuban culture and to include a plurality of dance influences.\n\nThe dance technique of \"la técnica cubana\" is athletic and powerful, reflective of the multitude of dance influences from Africa, Europe, North America, and Cuba. \"Técnica\" dancers are known to jump higher, undulate faster, and complete more turns than their dancer counterparts. Técnica is demanding and dynamic, producing dancers that move with remarkable ease.\n\nA class in \"la técnica cubana\" begins with a warm up on the center floor and barre exercises. The dancers alternate between parallel, first position, and second position. The warm up includes stretching of the upper body and hamstrings by extending the torso and arms in various directions. Guerra credits Afro-Cuban folkloric dance for the torso and pelvis movements prevalent in \"técnica\". He states, “The use of the pelvis is highly developed in our dances. Its instinctive for us. And all of the upper torso work is not only like this, but also in torsion.” After the torso and pelvis movements, hip rolls, relevés, drops to plié and neck twists usually follow the warm up, starting on one side and repeating on the other.\n\nAlthough the warm up includes many techniques derived from European ballet, such as relevés, pliés, tendus, and arabesques, the sequences themselves are composed of unparalleled elements. Dancers execute big jumps while traveling across the floor, incorporating turns and extensions. They balance on the balls of their feet, drop their bodies to the floor and leap up in a large split. One main characteristic of \"técnica\" is the large jumps, which range from barrel turns to \"tours en I’air\" to standard leaps.\n\nThe final portion of the class includes a cool down that incorporates the rhythms of several orisha images. The gentle walks are combined with undulating the spine and shaking the rib cage.\n\nImprovisation also plays a large role in the choreographing of \"técnica\". Guerra explains, “improvisation comes from popular dances, and from African tradition. We are very conscious of rhythm; we can do one rhythm with our hands and another with our feet, and this comes in part from flamenco.”\n\nOne hallmark of a \"técnica\" class is the use of a musical ensemble. A mixture of guitarists, drummers, singers, and flute players accompany every class, playing a variety of music types ranging from orisha songs, Afro-Cuban folklore, and country tunes. If the musicians play a familiar folk melody, the dancers join in singing all together. The presence of live music transforms the dance studio and affects the rhythm and kinetics of the dance techniques. After observing a \"técnica\" class at the National School of Dance, Suki John reflects, “the variations in dynamic and speed by the rhythmic complexity of the music affect the feeling of the movement profoundly.” The incorporation of live music is unique to \"técnica\" and links the dance technique to its Cuban heritage.\n\nThe dance technique of \"la técnica cubana\" is unique and expressive, and it encompasses a variety of other dance styles. \"Técnica\" is ever changing and the technique continues to evolve on stage where dancers and choreographers alike speak to changing times.\n\n"}

It is best known in UK popular culture as the music used in \"The Gallery\" sequence during the children's television programmes \"Vision On\", in which the art sent into the programme by young viewers was displayed, and subsequently in the equivalent segment in early series of \"Take Hart\", a programme presented by Tony Hart, formerly a co-presenter on \"Vision On\". It was also used later on in the 2000s for the Gallery segment in \"SMart\".\n\nHowever, the tune almost never got recorded. The session musicians who were recording a number of library music pieces for De Wolfe had some studio time left over on their session, so the question was asked \"Does anyone have anything else they'd like to try?\" to which the young vibes player, Wayne Hill, replied \"Well, there is this thing I've been working on …\" and produced the tune which is now so famous. Wayne and the other musicians quickly completed the composition and recorded it on the spot as a \"throwaway\" piece in their left-over studio time.\n\nThe piece has become synonymous with the making of art for those growing up in the 1970s, and has been used in a number of adverts for clients including Volkswagen and Castrol Oil.\n\nThe track was used as background music in the 2008 PlayStation 3 video game \"LittleBigPlanet\" and used again in \"LittleBigPlanet 2\", the latter as an 8-bit version of the track. It has also been used in a 2011 advertisement for the British supermarket chain Waitrose.\n\nThe track was used during seasons seven and nine of NBC's \"America's Got Talent\", and during season two of \"the X Factor\" Also, the BBC panel show \"QI\" features it in some episodes.\n\n"}
{"id": "30818181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30818181", "title": "Leçons de ténèbres", "text": "Leçons de ténèbres\n\nLeçons de ténèbres, literally translated \"lessons of darkness\", is a genre of French baroque music which developed from the polyphonic lamentations settings for the tenebrae service of Renaissance composers such as Sermisy, Gesualdo, Tallis, and Tomás Luis de Victoria into virtuoso solo chamber music.\n\nIn the original French sources Leçons de ténèbres is more common; The spelling Leçons des ténèbres is increasingly common in later resources, however modern sources still use de; as seen in Sébastien Gaudelus \"Les offices de Ténèbres en France, 1650–1790\" (2005). Capitalisation of ténèbres varies.\n\nThe tenebrae service uses the text of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, originally deploring the Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC) and subsequent desolation of the city, but applied allegorically to the three days of mourning for Christ between his crucifixion and resurrection.\n\nHowever the context of the French \"Leçons de ténèbres\" was often private performance. Delalande's 15-year-old daughter sang for Louis XIV first in his living rooms and then in chapel, becoming the praise of all Paris. Philidor's catalogue indicates that Delalande's three surviving virtuoso solo Leçons de ténèbres were composed for such occasions.\n\nA complete set of Leçons de ténèbres for the full three days of Holy Week would have included nine lessons, with each of these leçons requiring the setting of specific texts from Lamentations, although the conventions of exactly which texts to set varied slightly from the Renaissance to the Baroque, and by local custom. The following represents the typical French baroque schema set by Marc-Antoine Charpentier, which follows the order of the Roman Breviary of St. Pius V as it was promulgated after the Council of Trent in 1568.\n\n\nHowever, in practice composers rarely supplied a complete set of all 9 settings. A notable exception being Charpentier who authored a complete set \"Les Neuf Leçons de ténèbres\" (H. 96–110) and duplicated all the settings several times over.\n\nIn addition the services required antiphons and supplementary motets – 9 for each day, 27 in total. Charpentier again produced extensively in this genre, such as his \"Les neuf répons du mercredi saint\" (H. 111–119, 120–125, 135–137). As with the lessons the French répons are stylistically differentiated from the Renaissance responsories for Holy Week of Victoria and Gesualdo.\n\nThe characteristic style of the Leçons de ténèbres is defined by the trend to soloist virtuoso performance, for one or two vocalists with basso continuo, and introspective and melismatic music – specifically in the melismas on the Hebrew letters introducing each Latin verse.\n\nBy way of contrast the larger scale choral and orchestral lamentations of provincial composer Jean Gilles stand outside the mainly Parisian genre, and more in line with the lamentations of Central European baroque composers such as Zelenka and Heinichen.\n\nOf the settings by far the best known are the Leçons de ténèbres of Couperin, however Couperin's were not the first nor was he the most prolific composer in the genre:\n\n\nLater composers who in part followed the French chamber style in their settings of lamentations include:\n\n"}

This live art form is often contrasted with more studied fine art compositions from the same artists, which are generally executed in an artist studio or other private space.\n\nArtists in a number of genres have performed live painting, including famously LeRoy Neiman creating a painting during the 1976 Summer Olympics. In the 1990s and 2000s, live painting became a hallmark of street art and graffiti artists.\nLive painting has evolved beyond painting in situ by the impressionists, to incorporating the general public and arenas' of Modern Times.

{"id": "35758766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35758766", "title": "Love Torn in a Dream", "text": "Love Torn in a Dream\n\nLove Torn in a Dream (French: Combat d'amour en songe) is a 2000 film directed by Raúl Ruiz. The film's narrative spans nine interweaving stories, most of which take place in the 17th or 18th centuries, which feature fantastical characters such as pirates, nuns, young priests, a cannibal, a sultana, the Devil, and many more. To further complicate the already dizzying web of tales, many different characters are played by the same handful of actors across stories. This theme of the same individual portraying numerous identities extends beyond the limits of this one film (as many of Ruiz's themes do) and can be viewed in the larger context of Ruiz's work: for instance, lead actor Melvil Poupaud is someone who has been in several of Ruiz's films since his childhood. In 1983, at age ten he starred in Ruiz's \"City of Pirates\" and went on to act in \"The Insomniac on the Bridge\", \"Treasure Island\", \"Three Lives and Only One Death\", and \"Genealogies of a Crime\".\n\nProduced by Gemini Films, Madroga Filmes, Canal+, Radiotelevisao Portuguesa, among others, \"Love Torn in a Dream\" premiered August 20000 at the Montreal World Film Festival where it won for its category. From there, it went on to be released in France November 2000, Portugal May 2001, the Netherlands January 2002 at the International Film Festival Rotterdam, and Poland October 2002 at the Warsaw Film Festival.\n\nOpening in black and white with a puzzlingly self-aware narrated scene of \"Love Torn Within a Dream\" producer Paulo Branco welcoming the cast at a celebratory ceremony, the film quickly establishes (with the help of an illustrated configuration upon a chalkboard, one that explicitly references the theories of Ramon Lull’s \"ars combinatoria\", one of Ruiz’s ongoing artistic preoccupations) that there are nine stories that will weave in and out of each other throughout the film: The Meditations, The Robber Mirror, Twenty Two Rings, The Healing Painting, The Discussion, The Pirate’s Treasure, The Prophetic Site, The Castle of Dreams, and The Traveling Companion. Through overlapping threads and exchanged objects, these nine stories form some supposed twelve in total, though the situation becomes increasingly jumbled and less clear as the film goes on. A handful of actors portray different characters across storylines and centuries – Lucrezia, the nun-turned mystical nymph is played by the same woman (Elsa Zylberstein) who portrays modern-day Jessica who interacts with Paul, a student disturbed by a website foretelling his future. Paul is played by the same actor (Melvil Poupaud) who plays the troubled young Catholic who discovers he is Jewish, while many pirates and thieves, corpses and even the devil exchange actors in less pronounced roles throughout the film.\n\nThemes of a young theology student grappling with doubts over institutional ideologies and hypocrisy, the dangerous power of storytelling, shifting and self-proclaimed denial of identities, as well as piracy, charmed objects which act upon the bearers rather than the other way around, maps, and cannibalism are all recognizable as curious preoccupations and trademarks of Ruiz’s work to any seasoned fan.\n\n\n\"Variety\" identified it as \"witty diversion for upscale auds,\" perhaps hinting at the lofty, enigmatic narrative games it plays, praised it as \"another sly, spry intellectual game\", but complained about the excessive length of the film.\n\"Les Inrockuptibles\" found it impossible to summarize, and suggested it was a kind of self-parody of Ruiz's earlier films.\nDennis Schwartz, of Ozus' World Movie Reviews, gave this \"idiosyncratic film\" a B- on Rotten Tomatoes, and described it as \"an acting exercise to show-off the film-makers rich imagination.\"\n\n\"Love Torn in a Dream\" won the FIPRESCI Prize (International Press Award) in Montreal World Film Festival.\n\nJorge Arriagada composed the music and score of this film. He has worked with Ruiz on forty-four different films since their first collaboration on Ruiz's 1977 \"Colloque de chiens\". Arriagada is the youngest composer to have won a Guggenheim fellowship, which he did at age 29 in 1972.\n\n"}
{"id": "24016383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24016383", "title": "Luzhanqi", "text": "Luzhanqi\n\nLuzhanqi () (lit. “Land Battle Chess”) is a two-player Chinese board game . There is also a version for four players. It bears many similarities to Dou Shou Qi, Game of the Generals and the Western board game Stratego. It is a non-perfect abstract strategy game of partial information, since each player has only limited knowledge concerning the disposition of the opposing pieces. Because of the Chinese nature of the game, terms used within the game may vary in translation.\n\nLuzhanqi is mainly played by children as a precursor to games like xiangqi and weiqi, but people of other ages may also enjoy it as a game of leisure.\n\nThe aim of the game is to capture the opponent’s flag through penetrating his defenses, while trying to prevent him from capturing the player's own flag.\n\nThe Luzhanqi board has a number of features which affect how pieces move.\n\n\nEach player has 25 pieces, which are identical except for markings on one side. They are listed here in order of order, where any piece of a higher order may capture one of lower order (if the enemy is of the same order, both pieces will be removed from the board). Each player has:\n\n\nSome of these pieces have special features and abilities:\n\n\nBoth players begin by arranging their pieces on their half of the board, with the markings that indicate rank facing towards them (and hence invisible to the opponent). Some version allows the pieces to be placed face up, allowing both players to see them. Initially, all pieces must be placed on posts or headquarters; bombs may not be placed on the first rank, landmines must be placed on the last two ranks, and the flag must be placed in one of the headquarters spaces.\n\nPlay then proceeds by turns, with each player moving one piece per turn. On each move a piece may move to any connected adjacent space, or use the Railroad lines to travel to more distant spaces.\n\nWhen a piece lands on a space occupied by an opposing piece, the respective orders of the two pieces are compared (either by the players or by an independent referee). The lower-ordered piece is removed from the board; if the two are of equal order, both are to be removed from the board. Special pieces (see above) also play their respective roles.\n\nAs soon as a player's Field Marshal (order 9) is lost (having collided with the opposing Field Marshal, or was destroyed by a bomb or landmine), he must declare so by revealing the headquarters in which his Flag is placed.\n\nWhen a player attacks his opponent's headquarters, he will win the game if he enters the one with the flag; if he picked the other headquarters, then normal attacking rules apply, and if the attacking piece captures the headquarters piece, it must remain there and not move, revoking its purpose as a piece. However, with this, it becomes obvious to the attacking player that the flag must be planted in the other headquarters. (Some variants do not include this rule.)\n\nIt is feasible to send the Brigadier Generals or Major Generals (order 6 and 7) to attack the opponent's pieces, for these pieces are effective in getting rid of lower-ordered pieces and identifying those of higher order. Smaller-ordered pieces can be used to infiltrate the opponent's campsites, while Engineers are employed to remove landmines when the route to the opponent's fifth and sixth ranks is clear. Bombs should be sent to campsites as soon as possible to prevent accidental bombing, and should only be employed to destroy the highest-ordered pieces of order 8 and 9, to defend one's own flag from being captured, or to destroy a blocking landmine. The arrangement of landmines and nearby pieces should also be carefully thought out to secure the defense of the headquarters.\n\nOne of the main spin-offs of Luzhanqi is derived from arranging a board for four-players, with each taking up a territory adjacent to another at 90-degree angles. Players at opposite ends team up to defend against the other pair; the game ends when both players of a team has their flags captured, or when all sides are unable to defeat each other and thus agree to a draw.\n\nIf a player has his flag captured, he must admit defeat, thus removing all of his pieces off the board. He may also do so by resigning if his situation looks hopeless. In this case, if his ally across the board is still in the game, the game continues; otherwise, it ends with the victory of the other team. Even if a player admits defeat or resigns, his team may still win if his ally is able to defeat both opposing teams.\n\nAs shown in the diagram, there will no longer be Mountains or No-man's Lands, for the 9 shared spaces in the middle of the territories will be public territory. There are now curved railroads, where the rule for railroads still apply across the curve for all pieces: in a single turn, moving pieces can still travel along any part of the yellow line in the diagram, but not in the direction of the arrow. Engineers are still spared from this restriction and may move to any space accessible via railroads.\n\nThere are many variant rules of Junqi. Before a game, players usually decide which rule to use.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It recognises the special place of narration in human communication, making narration \"the foundation of discursive thought and the possibility of acting in common.\" This follows the narrative paradigm, a view of human communication based on the conception of persons as \"homo narrans\".\n\nBusiness organisations explicitly value \"hard\" knowledge that can be classified, categorized, calculated, analyzed, etc., practical know-how (explicit and tacit) and know-who (social connections). In contrast, storytelling employs ancient means of passing wisdom and culture through informal stories and anecdotes. The narrative is said to be more \"synthetic\" than \"analytic\", and help to: share norms and values, develop trust and commitment, share tacit knowledge, facilitate unlearning, and generate emotional connections. Storytelling is an ingredient to make an idea \"stick\".\n\nIn the business context, storytelling is nowadays also used in advertising and marketing.\nGiroux and Marroquin distinguish five perspectives in writings on organizational storytelling:\n\nThe functionalist perspective sees storytelling as a management tool. It considers a top-down communication (for example, the communication of a boss to his employees), and aims at the efficiency of the transmission. As such, the narration must be brief and consistent with objectives.\n\nThe interpretative perspective considers the organization as a subjective universe that the researcher can only grasp through the representations that the actors summon in their narrations. The narratives then bear both the central values and culture of the organization and the differences, conflicts and contradictions. Thus, officially promoted values are confronted with those that emerge from the narratives. There have been attempts to develop institutional interpretative devices by combining insights from anthropology, literary theory and institutionalism, for example. Antenarrative\n\nThe process perspective, following the work of Karl E. Weick, considers the organization not as a fixed entity but as an organising process that emphasises the interactions and co-construction. The researchers then study the narratives in situations of organizational change, controversy or deliberation. This perspective postulates that actors demonstrate a narrative intelligence, which refers to their \"ability to produce and understand stories\".\n\nThe critical perspective emphasizes the asymmetrical relationships within organizations. The narration can be used to \"create a culture of submission\". The critical feminist prospective focuses on gender differences, revealing how they are created, nurtured, conveyed and challenged by narratives.\n\nThe postmodern perspective, which is the most recent and controversial, sees society and organization as fragmented. It places textuality at the center of the researcher's approach, and promotes the polyphony of speech. The researcher becomes a narrator by giving a voice to marginalized employees.\n\n\n"}

Some smaller knock-off figures also exist, both as wired-armature, rubber \"bendy\" figures and hard plastic figures (included in playsets).\n\nModern Series\n\nIn 2008, creator Birnkrant partnered with Wall Street specialist Gary Schaeffer to form a company called The Outer Space Men, LLC, which has revived the 'OSM' brand with release of a graphic novel, and a number of related products, including a new series of action figures.\n\nFour Horsemen Studios was granted the rights to produce new action figures based on the OSM characters, marking the \"first\" time the sculptors have acquired a licensed property to develop on their own. Translucent versions of Waves one and two of this series went on sale as a Comic-Con International exclusive in late July 2010. The new figures are rendered in a smaller 3-3/4 inch 'scale', not using wire armatures, but instead utilizing a proprietary Glyos joint system, and were initially packaged in a simple poly. bag with full-color cardboard header, before switching to a standard blister card package. The characters Astro-Nautilus, Inferno, Metamorpho, and Xodiac were chosen for the debut release. Five hundred of each was produced for the event, and availability was split between Internet sale and on-site purchase at the convention. The set of four sold at a retail price of $40; both venues sold through this exclusive offering completely in about 24 hours.\n\nThis toyline continued for four more years, releasing the following characters throughout its duration, in a wide variety of colours:\n\n\nIn 2018, 4 new characters will be released to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the original toyline:\n\n\n"}

With presentational acting, the actor acknowledges the audience. With representational acting, the audience is studiously ignored and treated as voyeurs.\n\nIn the sense of actor-character relationship, the type of theatre that uses 'presentational acting' in the actor-audience relationship, is often associated with a performer using 'representational acting' in their actor-character methodology. Conversely, the type of theatre that uses 'representational acting' in the first sense is often associated with a performer using 'presentational acting' methodology.\n\nIn every theatrical performance the manner in which each individual actor treats the audience establishes, sustains or varies a particular kind of actor-audience relationship between them.\n\nIn some plays all of the actors may adopt the same attitude towards the audience (for example, the entire cast of a production of a Chekhovian drama will usually ignore the audience until the curtain call); in other plays the performers create a range of different relationships towards the audience (for example, most Shakespearean dramas have certain characters who frequently adopt a downstage 'platea' playing position that is in direct contact with the audience, while other characters behave as if unaware of the audience's presence).\n\n'Presentational acting', in this sense, refers to a relationship that acknowledges the audience, whether directly by addressing them, or indirectly through a general attitude or specific use of language, looks, gestures or other signs that indicate that the character or actor is aware of the audience's presence. (Shakespeare's use of punning and wordplay, for example, often has this function of indirect contact.)\n\n'Representational acting', in this sense, refers to a relationship in which the audience is studiously ignored and treated as 'peeping tom' voyeurs by an actor who remains in-character and absorbed in the dramatic action. The actor behaves as if a fourth wall was present, which maintains an absolute autonomy of the dramatic fiction from the reality of the theatre.\n\nRobert Weimann argues that:\nEach of these theatrical practices draws upon a different register of imaginary appeal and \"puissance\" and each serves a different purpose of playing. While the former derives its primary strength from the immediacy of the physical act of histrionic delivery, the latter is vitally connected with the imaginary product and effect of rendering absent meanings, ideas, and images of artificial persons' thoughts and actions. But the distinction is more than epistemological and not simply a matter of poetics; rather it relates to the issue of function.\n\nThe use of these critical terms (in an almost directly \"opposed\" sense from the critical mainstream usage detailed above) to describe two different forms of the actor–character relationship within an actor's methodology originates from the American actor and teacher Uta Hagen. She developed this use from a far more ambiguous formulation offered by the seminal Russian theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski in chapter two of his acting manual \"An Actor's Work\" (1938).\n\nIn \"When Acting is an Art\", having watched his students' first attempts at a performance, Stanislavski's fictional persona Tortsov offers a series of critiques, during the course of which he defines different forms and approaches to acting. They are: 'forced acting', 'overacting', 'the exploitation of art', 'mechanical acting', 'art of representation', and his own 'experiencing the role'. One common misrepresentation of Stanislavski is the frequent confusion of the first five of these categories with one another; Stanislavski, however, goes to some lengths to insist that 'two of them deserve to be evaluated as 'art': his own approach of 'experiencing the role' and that of the 'art of representation'. He also makes the concession that so called \"mechanical\" can appear (when done well enough) to be almost the same as representation in the eyes of the audience, and is therefore occasionally artistic in quality.\n\nThe distinction between Stanislavski's 'experiencing the role' and 'representing the part' (which Stanislavski identifies with the French actor Coquelin) turns on the relationship that the actor establishes with their character during the performance. In Stanislavski's approach, by the time the actor reaches the stage, he or she no longer experiences a distinction between his or her self and the character; the actor has created a 'third being', or a combination of the actor's personality and the role (in Russian, Stanislavski calls this creation \"artisto-rol\"). In the art of representation approach, whilst on-stage the actor experiences the distinction between the two (the philosopher and dramatist Diderot calls this psychological duality the actor's 'paradox'). Both approaches use 'living the role' or identifying with the character during rehearsals; Stanislavski's approach undertakes this process at all times onstage, while the 'art of representation' incorporates the results of the rehearsal process in a \"finished\" form.\n\nDue to the same terms being applied to certain approaches to acting that contradict the broader theatrical definitions, however, the terms have come to acquire often overtly contradictory senses. In the most common sense (that which relates the specific dynamics of theatre to the broader aesthetic category of 'representational art' or 'mimesis' in drama and literature), the terms describe two contrasting functional relationships between the actor and the audience that a performance can create.\n\nIn the other (more specialized) sense, the terms describe two contrasting methodological relationships between the actor and his or her character in performance.\n\nThe collision of these two senses can get quite confusing. The type of theatre that uses 'presentational acting' in the first sense (of the actor-audience relationship) is often associated with a performer using 'representational acting' in the second sense (of their methodology). Conversely, the type of theatre that uses 'representational acting' in the first sense is often associated with a performer using 'presentational acting' in the second sense. While usual, these chiastic correspondences do not match up in all cases of theatrical performance.\n\nStanislavski's choice of the phrase 'art of representation' to describe an artistic approach that diverges from his own has led to some confusion, given that the theatre that is often associated with his own 'experiencing the role' approach (realistic, not acknowledging the audience) is 'representational' in the wider critical sense. Uta Hagen's decision to use 'presentational' as a synonym for Stanislavski's 'experiencing the role' served to compound the confusion, part of the reason she preferred to refer to them more clearly as \"formalistic acting\" and \"realistic acting\".\n\nIn their textbooks for actors, both Stanislavski and Hagen adhere to a mode of theatrical performance that starts with the subjective experience of the actor, who takes action under the circumstances of the character, and trusts that a form will follow. They deem it more useful for the actor to focus exclusively on the fictional, subjective reality of the character (via the actor's \"emotional memory\" or \"transferences\" from his own life), without concerning himself with the external realities of the theatre. Both teachers were fully aware of the 'outside' to the dramatic fiction, but they believed that from the actor's perspective these considerations do not help the performance, and only lead to false, mechanical acting.\n\nMany types of drama in the history of theatre do make use of the presentational 'outside' and its many possible interactions with the representational 'inside'—Shakespeare, Restoration comedy, and Brecht, to name a few significant examples. However, both Stanislavski and Hagen applied their processes of acting towards these types of drama as well, fully aware of their unique requirements to the audience. Hagen stated that style is a label given to the \"final product\" by critics, scholars, and audience members, and that the \"creator\" (actor) need only explore the subjective content of the playwright's world. She saw definitions of \"style\" as something tagged by others onto the result, having nothing to do with the actor's process.\n\nShakespearean drama assumed a natural, direct and often renewed \"contact\" with the audience on the part of the performer. 'Fourth wall' performances foreclose the complex layerings of theatrical and dramatic realities that result from this contact and that are built into Shakespeare's dramaturgy. A good example is the line spoken by Cleopatra in act five of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" (1607), when she contemplates her humiliation in Rome at the hands of Octavius Caesar; she imagines mocking theatrical renditions of her own story: \"And I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the posture of a whore\" (5.2.215-217). That this was to be spoken by a boy in a dress in a theatre is an integral part of its dramatic meaning. Opponents of the Stanislavski/Hagen approach have argued that this complexity is unavailable to a purely 'naturalistic' treatment that recognizes no distinction between actor and character nor acknowledges the presence of the actual audience. They may also argue that it is not only a matter of the interpretation of individual moments; the presentational dimension is a structural part of the meaning of the drama as a whole. This structural dimension is most visible in Restoration comedy through its persistent use of the aside, though there are many other meta-theatrical aspects in operation in these plays.\n\nIn Brecht, the interaction between the two dimensions—representational and presentational—forms a major part of his 'epic' dramaturgy and receives sophisticated theoretical elaboration through his conception of the relation between \"mimesis\" and \"Gestus\". How to play Brecht, in regard to presentational vs. representational has been a controversial subject of much critical and practical discussion. Hagen's opinion (backed up by conversations with Brecht himself and the actress who was directed by him in the original production of \"Mother Courage\") was that, for the actor, Brecht always intended it to be about the character's subjective reality—including the direct audience addresses. The very structure of the play was enough to accomplish his desired \"alienation\".\n\n\nRepresentational actor–audience relations:\n\nPresentational actor–audience relations:\n\n"}

The term is offered as an alternative to the term old media. Residual media attempts to act as a corrective to the idea that when media become old, they absolutely become obsolete, or “dead media.” Residual media “reveals that, ultimately, new cultural phenomena rely on encounters with the old”. While old media can, and often does, become obsolete, they do not die. Instead, old media persist in our culture—either in storage units or landfills, or as cultural capital for niche groups—or they can be moved to other parts of the world and other cultures. Regardless of where they end up, the media is not dead, they are still very much living, changing, and evolving. Residual media helps show that the transition between old and new media is not simplistic, well-defined, or sweeping. Examples of residual media include film cameras and film, record players and LP records, radio, letters, and postcards, etc.\n\nResidual media was first defined in the edited collection \"Residual Media\" by Charles R. Acland. The term itself stems from Raymond Williams' study of culture’s dominant, emergent, and residual forms. The residual forms, Williams says, are “experiences, meanings and values which cannot be expressed in terms of the dominant culture,” but “are nevertheless lived and practiced on the basis of residue—cultural as well as social—of some previous social formation”. In relation to media, the dominant culture would be new media, while the residual would be the forms of media that have come before, but are still in use regardless of the new supplanting them. Williams’s definition of the residual is also important because it emphasizes that these old forms of media are “still active in the cultural process, not only and often not at all as an element of the past, but as an effective element of the present”. Residual media, though antiquated or seen as lesser than the new media, still exist in the present and still affect that which is dominant. The way we interact with the old still informs the way we interact with the new, and the new informs the way we interact with the old. The idea of residual media is closely related to Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin's theory of Remediation (Marxist theory).\n\n\n"}

He began performing a song and dance act with his brother Dick in variety houses in Manhattan, changing their stage name from Barnett as they considered the name Bernard more \"ethnic\".

{"id": "2312784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2312784", "title": "Sludge (Transformers)", "text": "Sludge (Transformers)\n\nSludge is a fictional character in the Transformers franchise. Sludge is a slow witted but powerful Dinobot. Sludge's strength is considered to be second only to Grimlock's in the Dinobot faction. Sludge also has the great power to shake the ground violently and make huge tremors when stomping around in his Brontosaurus mode, which is a good weapon for shaking up Decepticons. Sludge also was seen at times to shoot laser beams from his eyes and an energy weapon from his mouth. Sludge's biggest weakness is his belief that the strongest Autobot should lead and not necessarily the smartest. Another weakness of Sludge's is that he is depicted as being mentally slow. He joined the Autobots in the cartoon and comics in their first year, but didn't have a toy until 1985. The other members of the Dinobots are Slag, Snarl, Swoop, and their leader, Grimlock.\n\nSludge (Terro in Québec, Bronto in Italy) is the Brontosaurus Dinobot. \n\nSludge represents both prehistoric times and an ultra-tech future, which are many children's preferred worlds these days.\n\nHe is sometimes known as Slog.\n\nIn the \"Transformers\" comic series, Sludge was among the Autobots who joined Optimus Prime in his mission on board the Ark to save the planet Cybertron from a meteor shower 4 million years ago. They were attacked by Megatron and his Decepticon forces. After crashing on the planet Earth, they were followed to Earth by the Decepticon named Shockwave. Grimlock and his soldiers were reformatted by the Ark's computer Teletraan I using the last of its energy to resemble Earth native animals. They attacked Shockwave and were buried with him together in a tar pit in the Savage Land until the 1980s when the Autobot Ratchet recovered and repaired them.\n\nThe tar pit had corroded vital systems and the Dinobots lapsed into primitive savagery. Sludge took up a peaceful existence in a swamp, which was discovered by TV journalist Joy Meadows; as a result of the attention she gave to him, Sludge developed a long-standing crush on her. During the Dinobot Hunt, he was captured by Soundwave and made to fight Grimlock, a battle that destroyed a town and which Sludge won before the Autobots could recapture him. Once fully repaired, Sludge's crush on Joy lead him to seek her out and this led the Dinobots to assist her in trying to expose the Robot-Master scam, battling both the Decepticons and the Triple-I intelligence organisation.\n\nSludge remained tied to the Dinobots and happily followed them in going AWOL, returning to the Ark & supporting Grimlock as leader, battling the Predacons, and joining the Autobot Earthforce.\n\nHe was seemingly destroyed by the Underbase-powered Starscream.\n\nSludges's body was seen among the deactivated Autobots Ratchet was doing his best to revive in Transformers #56, \"Back from the Dead\".\n\nAlong with his fellow Dinobots was one of the first Transformers to be revived by Nucleon. He was part of the united Autobot and Decepticon forces who opposed Unicron's assault on the planet Cybertron in 1991 (Transformers #75).\n\nSludge was created by Wheeljack and Ratchet on Earth in 1984. He was created along with Grimlock and Slag as the original three Dinobots. At first they rampaged through the Ark and Optimus Prime ordered that the Dinobots be put offline permanently, but when he and the other Autobots were captured by Megatron, Sludge and the other Dinobots were used to rescue Optimus and the other Autobots.\n\nShortly after, Megatron convinced Sludge and the Dinobots that Optimus and the Autobots were their enemies and the Dinobots kidnapped Optimus Prime. Wheeljack and Ratchet, with the help of Chip Chase, created Swoop and Snarl and the two new Dinobots were used to rescue Prime from Grimlock, Slag, and Sludge. During that battle, Optimus saved the original Dinobots' lives and they then realized that the Autobots were really their friends.\n\nIn 1985, an Island with real dinosaurs was found by Powerglide and Bumblebee. Optimus decided that Dinobot Island would be a good place for the Dinobots to train and practice their fighting skills, because the Ark was too small for the giant Dinobots. Megatron and the Decepticons found out about the island and wanted to harvest it for all the energy it produced. The Dinobots were thrown in a pit of tar, but were later rescued and got a bunch of real dinosaurs to help them attack Megatron.\n\nLater, the Cybertronian Autobots and Decepticons began to malfunction because they ran out of Cybertonium, a crystalline substance only found on Cybertron. The Dinobots were made on Earth, so they were the only Transformers not affected and were sent to Cybertron to get some. When they got to Cybertron, they disappeared. Spike and Carly went to Cybertron to find them and found Swoop, who led them to the other Dinobots that were captured and working for Shockwave. Eventually they were freed and brought the Cybertonium back so that the Autobot's bodies could be restored.\n\nIn , the Dinobots came in the shuttle with Optimus Prime towards the end of the attack on Autobot City. When Galvatron attacked, they went in the shuttle with Kup and Hot Rod. The shuttle was shot down on Quintessa and Kup and Hot Rod were captured by the Quintessons. On Quintessa, the Dinobots met Wheelie, who led them to Kup and Hot Rod and they were able to rescue the two Autobots from the Quintessons. They took a ship to the planet of Junk and were with the Autobots when they attacked Unicron. They helped with the attack on Unicron but were not very effective. Sludge's speaking role in the movie was very limited. He only said \"QUIET!\" but with Grimlock's voice.\n\nOnly Grimlock played a large role in the episodes following the movie, although Sludge and the other Dinobots could be seen from time to time.\n\nIn the episode \"Call of the Primitives\" Primacron's assistant mistakenly called Sludge by the name \"Sweep\".\n\nSludge was featured in the 1985 Find Your Fate Junior book called \"Dinobots Strike Back\" by Casey Todd.\n\nSludge appeared in the 1986 story and coloring book \"The Lost Treasure of Cybertron\" by Marvel Books.\n\nSludge made a cameo, as with the other Dinobots, in the audiobook Jaws Of Terror.\n\nWhen civil war broke out on the planet Cybertron 8.7 million years ago between the Autobots and Deceptions, Sludge joined the Autobot cause.\n\nWhen Autobot leader Optimus Prime and Decepticon leader Megatron disappeared in an accident with the space bridge 7.4 million years ago, the Autobot and Decepticon forces broke up into factions. Sludge joined up with the Lightning Strike Coalition under the command of Grimlock. In The War Within, Sludge's alternate mode is a Cybertronian driller.\n\nGrimlock lead L.S.C. members Ironhide, Kup, Slag, Sludge, Snarl, Swoop and Wheeljack in stealing a shipment of Energon from Starscream and the Predacons at the Moon Alpha Space Port (Transformers: The War Within - The Dark Ages #1).\n\nUltra Magnus reunited the Autobot factions, with Grimlock working as one of his advisors. Sludge became a member of the Dynobots, a special Autobot unit directly under Grimlock's command.\n\nThe Dynobots were assigned to security at the peace talks between the Autobots, Decepticons and Ultracons 6 million years ago. It was their actions which saved the participants from being blown up in a sneak attack by Starscream and his Predacons (Transformers: Age of Wrath #1).\n\nAfter Optimus Prime and the crew of the Autobot ship the Ark were lost in space 4 million years ago, the Dynobots formed a search party to recover them. They tracked the Autobot ship to the planet Earth, where the Dynobots were reformatted into mechanical dinosaurs, and Sludge gained his current form. The Dynobots were ambushed by the Insecticons, and left in stasis lock until they were discovered by Prime and his crew in the 1980s. Because of their new alternate forms they were renamed the Dinobots.\n\nIn 2004 Sludge was among the Autobots under the leadership Optimus Prime who attempted to take back the planet Cybertron from the Decepticon tyrant Shockwave. After an accident with the teleportational systems of the supercomputer Teletraan 3, Slag found himself sent back in time and on the planet Earth. He was reformatted in the form of an Earth dinosaur with several other Autobots. A group of humans were able to bring the new Dinobots back to Cybertron and they helped overcome Shockwave (G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers II #4).\n\nIn a flashback in \"Maximum Dinobots\" #1 Grimlock lead the Dynobots in taking a Decepticon energon silo in Sub-Sector Nine on Cybertron.\nIn the issue on Shockwave, Grimlock and the 'Dynobots' (sporting Cybertronian designs much like their War Within designs) appear in a story that partially homages their Marvel G1 origin. Seeking payback for a humiliating defeat by Shockwave, Grimlock pursued him to prehistoric Earth (which Shockwave was seeding with Energon). In order to protect themselves against Energon surges, the Dynobots required alternate modes covered by a layer of synthetic flesh; Grimlock refused to transform into Ice Age mammals and made the decision to go with dinosaurian forms instead as he thought them more impressive. The Dynobots got the initial jump on Shockwave, as their attack was too illogical for him to understand, but he quickly recovered and blasted the entire team into stasis lock with their synthetic skins destroyed. Grimlock got the final laugh, as the Dynobot ship fired a pre-programmed blast into the surrounding volcanoes to unleash a flow of lava that engulfs all six Transformers until they were uncovered by human paleontologists in 2006.\n\nAccording to the biography printed in the Transformers Collectors Club magazine, Slag and Sludge were part of Grimlock's band of Decepticon hunters on board the ship \"Graviton\". When Grimlock left Ultra Magnus in charge to join Optimus Prime on Earth, Slag and Sludge departed the \"Graviton\", not wanting to be under the command of Magnus. The two Dinobots went off on their own, and happened across Nightbeat. Nightbeat offered them a job as muscle, which they took because they figured Nightbeat has a nose for finding trouble, which they enjoy.\n\nThe Fun Publications 2008 \"Timelines\" Summer Special, entitled \"Cheap Shots\", features Autobots Nightbeat, Slag, Sludge, and Siren.

{"id": "4711894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4711894", "title": "Speedster (fiction)", "text": "Speedster (fiction)\n\nA speedster is a character whose powers primarily relate to superhuman speed (also known as superspeed). Primary abilities shared by all speedsters include running at speeds far in excess of human capability (to varying degrees) and resistance to the side effects (air resistance, inability to breathe, dynamic shock resulting from contact with objects at high speed, etc.) that result from such velocity. In almost all cases, speedsters are able to physically attack opponents by striking them while at high speed to impart huge amounts of kinetic energy without suffering harm, although this has on rare occasion been lampshaded by characters discovering that they cannot do this and suffering severe injury from the attempt. A variety of other powers have been attributed to speedsters depending on the story, the origin of the power, and the established continuity and rules of a given universe.\n\nThe use of speedsters in fiction requires artistic license due to the laws of physics that would prohibit such abilities. Moving at the speed of sound, for example, would create sonic booms that are usually not heard in such stories. An enormous amount of energy would be required to achieve such speeds, and as some speedsters can actually move close to or at the speed of light, this would cause them to gain near-infinite mass, according to the laws of relativity.\n\nFor example, the \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\" states that the character Nova maintains speeds which can be considered \"modest,\" especially when carrying a passenger. The Handbook also concedes that a solid object moving in the Earth’s atmosphere at several times the speed of sound or faster would wreak havoc on the planet and that moving at such speeds would prohibit Northstar from breathing, while the generated wind/friction would ravage his body. On the other hand, the Handbook states that the character Quicksilver was born with adaptations that make higher speeds possible, such as enhanced cardiovascular, respiratory, musculature, and digestive systems, a more efficient metabolism (which has been a weakness for some incarnations of the Flash, calling themselves \"snack holes\"), better lubricated joints, tendons with the tensile strength of spring steel, unidentified bone composition that can withstand the dynamic shock of his touching the ground at speeds over 100 miles an hour, and a brain that can process information fast enough for him to react to his surroundings at high speed.\n\nIn comics published by DC Comics, the Flash family of speedsters derive their abilities from an extradimensional energy source known as the Speed Force, which grants them superspeed and various other abilities required to use it, such as durability. However, the Speed Force is not the source from which other DC characters with superspeed such as Superman or Captain Marvel/Shazam derive their powers.\n\nWriter John Byrne maintained modest abilities for the speedster character Danny Hilltop in his series \"John Byrne’s Next Men\". Although Danny can keep pace with a race car, the friction generated by his speed melts any footwear he wears, burning his feet. Thus he runs barefoot, having toughened the soles of his feet through a regimen of pounding increasingly harder materials (sand, gravel and then broken rock). The costume he wears has a built-in guidance system.\n\nOther writers choose not to offer any scientific explanations for the questions raised by the actual use of such abilities.\n\nComic book writer Peter David, whose run on the series \"Young Justice\" included the junior speedster Impulse, has opined that speedsters are inherently difficult to write, saying:\n\nSome speedsters may also end up destroying their surroundings or entire astronomical structures around them by their sheer speed alone if they are not careful enough. For example, Saitama from \"One-Punch Man\" accidentally destroyed a large portion of the Moon when he jumped back to Earth from it within ten seconds during his battle with Boros.\n\nSpeedsters in other media include Daphne Millbrook (played by Brea Grant), a character in the NBC television superhero drama \"Heroes\". Daphne first appeared in that series' third season in 2008, initially as a villain.\n\nIn addition, many characters exist in other media such as film, video games, anime and manga who possess the abilities to perform feats at incredible speeds that exceed the abilities of those around them. Examples include the video game character Sonic the Hedgehog, and the animated cartoon characters Speedy Gonzales, the Road Runner, Morton of \"Horton Hears A Who!\", several Ben 10 Aliens including XLR8, Jetray, and Fasttrack, (and in one case, Pinkie Pie taking on an alter ego called 'Filisecond' in a comic book universe) from \"\", Saitama, Speed o' Sound Sonic, Flashy Flash and several other characters of \"One-Punch Man\", several Stand users and almost all other characters from \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\", Goku, Vegeta, Frieza, Beerus, Whis, Jiren and practically every single character in the entire \"Dragon Ball\" franchise and Dash Parr of \"The Incredibles\". Bree Davenport, the superhero from \"Lab Rats\" is the one the characters depend on to take them to mission sights.\n"}
{"id": "17883418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17883418", "title": "Sponsus", "text": "Sponsus\n\nSponsus or The Bridegroom is a medieval Latin and Occitan dramatic treatment of Jesus' parable of the ten virgins. A liturgical play designed for Easter Vigil, it was composed probably in Gascony or western Languedoc in the mid-eleventh century. Its scriptural basis is found in the \"Gospel of Matthew\" (25:1–13), but it also draws on the \"Song of Songs\" and the Patristics, perhaps Jerome's \"Adversus Jovinianum\". In certain respects—the portrayal of the merchants, the spilling of the oil, the implicit questioning of accepted theodicy—it is original and dramatically powerful.\n\n\"Sponsus\" is the Latin word for groom/husband and is a cognate of the English \"spouse\". The feminine form is \"sponsa\" (bride/wife).\n\nThe play opens with an unnamed narrative voice explaining the allegory of the parable, the identity of the bridegroom with Jesus, and the Gospel. This unnamed voice has been identified with both Gabriel and the Church (\"Ecclesia\") personified. The next speaker of the play, who uses Occitan, is probably Gabriel, though this rubric is fragmentary and identifies only those whom he addresses: the \"prudentes\", prudent ones. The angel tells the five wise virgins—the five foolish ones have presumably fallen asleep after \"Ecclesia\"'s more general caution—to attend a groom, Jesus Christ, who came to save them from their sins. He gives them the ominous warning \"Gaire no.i / dormet\": \"Don't fall asleep!\", which is repeated several times.\n\nAfter Gabriel's message, the foolish virgins (recognised from the rubric \"fatue\") enter and announce that they have spilled the oil for their lamps. The spilling of the oil was probably acted out for dramatic effect, though the bible knows nothing of it. The foolish then plead with the wise to share their oil, capping each strophe with the lamenting refrain \"Dolentas, chaitivas, trop i avem dormit\": \"We, wretched in our grief, have slept too long!\" The wise virgins turn them away without pity, inviting them to buy oil from the merchants nearby. The foolish (who now seem wise) only blame themselves, but the merchants, who are presented sympathetically, tell them that they cannot help them and advise them to beseech their sisters in God's name. The merchants' eight lines, which are significant to the dramatic movement, are given in Occitan without any comparable Latin. The dramatist builds tension between the foolish, who are repentant, the wise, who are condescending, and the merchants, who are sympathetic to the foolish and trusting of the charity of the wise. The text's English translator, Peter Dronke, praises the dramatist's clever portrayal and insights into human nature.\n\nThe foolish do not follow the merchants' advice, having been twice rebuffed by their wise sisters. The drama ends when \"modo veniat sponsus\": \"Now let the bridegroom arrive.\" \"Christus\" arrives as bridegroom and promptly dismisses the foolish virgins' pleas, sending them away. They are then taken by demons to Hell: the earliest attested appearance of demons in western drama. Christ's lines are sung to the same melody as \"Ecclesia\"'s and the drama closes where it has begun, with the foretold penalty for negligence being meted out by the agents of Hell. It is possible that the play was acted above the stairwell that led to the crypt and that a brazier may have sufficed as an inferno for the maidens to be led into by grotesque demons. There is a possible \"serio-comic\" combination of gravity and levity in the final scenes of the play. On the other hand, Davidson suggests that the demons must have been portrayed in grim seriousness as personifications of real human fears.\n\n\"Sponsus\" is one of the earliest fully dramatic accounts of the parable of the virgins. The pitiless treatment of the foolish virgins, who are portrayed sympathetically, was probably designed to question the official interpretation of the Scriptures. A later medieval German play on the same theme and style, the \"Ludus de decem virginibus\" (the Eisenacher \"Zehnjungfrauenspiele\"), so disturbed the landgrave of Thuringia, Frederick I, and caused him to doubt God's mercy, that he took to his bed ill on 4 May 1321.\n\nThe manuscript in which \"Sponsus\" is preserved is in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Latin 1139, the Saint-Martial codex, folios 53r–55v. It was copied in the late eleventh century in or around Limoges, since the Occitan appears to be the Limousin dialect, though originally it may have been another dialect. It was probably composed in the 1050s or 1060s.\n\nScholarship is divided over whether the Latin and Occitan parts of \"Sponsus\" were written at the same time (Peter Dronke) or whether the Occitan parts are later additions (D'Arco Silvio Avalle). The latter school of thought regards them as explanations (\"gloss\" or \"farcitures\") of the Latin. Regardless, the vernacular Occitan portions were probably intended for the unlearned audience, who would not be familiar with Latin, as the clerical audience would. Dronke believes the dramatist to be more powerful in his native tongue, and it is in that language that Christ delivers the final lines of the play.\n\nThe music of \"Sponsus\" has been praised by Rafaello Monteross for \"redeem[ing] the anonymous poet's colourless paraphrase of the gospel text from its generic inexpressiveness.\" The melodic phrasing is varied, but only four different melodies are used for the entire play, though none of them is liturgical, and none form motifs. The entire score is original and is recorded in Aquitainian neumes.\n\nThe strophic structure of the play is consistent throughout. The two principal metres are fifteen-syllable lines (for the Latin), with antecedents in classical trochaic septenarii, and ten-syllable lines (used for both Latin and Occitan), with predecessors in late antique and Merovingian hymns. The late antique hymn \"Apparebit repentina dies magna domini\" may have been an inspiration.\n\nThe combination of original music, unique theme, and implicit questioning of traditional theodicies have led to the suggestion that the play may stand at the very beginning of non-liturgical and vernacular drama in Europe.\n"}
{"id": "4323067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4323067", "title": "Vestiarium Scoticum", "text": "Vestiarium Scoticum\n\nThe Vestiarium Scoticum (full title, \"Vestiarium Scoticum: from the Manuscript formerly in the Library of the Scots College at Douay. With an Introduction and Notes, by John Sobieski Stuart\") was a book which was first published in 1842 by William Tait of Edinburgh in a limited edition. John Telfer Dunbar, in his seminal work \"History of Highland Dress,\" referred to it as \"probably the most controversial costume book ever written\".\n\nThe book itself is purported to be a reproduction, with colour illustrations, of a 15th-century manuscript on the clan tartans of Scottish families. Shortly after its publication it was denounced as a forgery, and the \"Stuart\" brothers who brought it forth were also denounced as impostors for claiming to be the grandsons of Bonnie Prince Charlie. It is generally accepted today that neither the brothers themselves nor the \"Vestiarium\" are what they were purported to be.\n\nNevertheless, the role of the book in the history of Scottish tartans is immense, with many of the designs and patterns contained therein passing into the realm of \"official\" clan tartans.\n\nThe 1842 edition of the \"Vestiarium\" had its beginnings in the late 1820s, when the Sobieski Stuart brothers, then residents of Moray, Scotland, produced a copy of a document containing tartan patterns and showed it to their host, Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, Bt. This manuscript, however, was not the one that the brothers claimed to be the basis for the later publication of the \"Vestiarium\".\n\nAs explained in the Preface to the 1842 edition (which is extensively excerpted in Dunbar's \"History of Highland Dress\"), the copy which Sir Thomas saw, now known as the Cromarty MS, which bore the date 1721 on the first page and with the title \"Liber Vestiarium Scotia\", was said by its possessors to have been obtained from a certain John Ross of Cromarty, and was said also by them to be an inferior copy of an earlier manuscript.\n\nIn this same Preface, it is claimed that the 1842 edition is based on an original manuscript, now known as the Douay MS, whose date was claimed to be 1571 (or earlier), which was at that time in the possession of John Lesley, Bishop of Ross. This Douay MS is said by the author of the Preface to be the \"oldest and most perfect\" copy of the \"Vestiarium\". Having once been in the possession of Bishop Ross, it had found its way subsequently into the library of the Scots College at Douay. From there, it was supposed to have come into the possession of Bonnie Prince Charlie himself, who took over the MS when on a visit to the Scots College in the early 1750s.\n\nSoon after Sir Thomas saw the book, he wrote of it to Sir Walter Scott, in a letter dated 1 June 1829. In this letter, Lauder highly commended the book, stating that several clan chiefs, such as Cluny MacPherson and McLeod, had derived their \"true and authentic\" tartans therefrom. Lauder described the manuscript in detail, stating that he had obtained drawings, in colour, of all of the tartans contained therein (about 66 in number) and sent some of these to Sir Walter Scott himself. In addition to material on tartans, the book also contained appendices on women's plaids (arisaids) and on hose and trews. In the end, Lauder urged the brothers to have the book published and made inquiries concerning costs and procedures to that end. A plan was adopted to publish it, illustrated by swatches of silk in the tartan colours and patterns.\n\nIn his reply of 5 June 1829 Scott expressed scepticism over the claims of both the brothers Sobieski and the manuscript itself, at the same time requesting that a copy of the MS be sent for investigation by competent authorities in antiquities. Among other things, he disputed the assertion that Lowlanders had ever worn tartans or plaids, questioned the lack of any corroborating evidence (including any in Bishop Lesley's writings even though Lesley was said to have been in possession at one time of the original upon which the present MS was based), and called into question the authenticity of the brothers. He also noted that the title – \"Vestiarium Scoticum\" – was, in his words, \"false Latin\".\n\nOn 20 July 1829 Sir Thomas replied to Sir Walter. In this letter, he describes the (alleged) 1571 original from which the 1721 copy, which he saw, is said to be derived and which was in the possession of the brothers' father in London. Sir Thomas then goes on to discuss the brothers' character, credibility, and society's opinion of them, admitting that the \"Quixotism of the two brothers must render these very unfortunate individuals for the introduction of a piece of antiquarian matter to the world…\". He nevertheless reasserts his belief in the authenticity of the MS and goes on to discuss the \"false Latin\" and the presumed use of tartans in the Lowlands.\n\nIn a final letter in this exchange from Scott to Lauder, dated 19 November 1829, Scott rejected again the authenticity of the \"Vestiarium Scoticum\" and further rejected the notion that Lowlanders ever wore clan tartans. He went further and rejected the entire notion of clan tartans, stating that the \"idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date…\".\n\nThe \"Vestiarium\" was finally published in 1842. A summary of its contents follows.\n\n\nThe tartans presented in the \"Vestiarium\" were divided into two sections. First came the \"Highland clans\" and this was followed by \"Lowland Houses and Border Clans\". In the listing below, the clan name (with original spelling as it appeared in the VS) is followed by the Scottish Tartans Society number (TS#) and the (modern) thread count. Please note that these may not be the official clan tartans. For example, the tartan shown for Clan Campbell, known as \"Campbell of Argyll\", was only worn by the Sixth Duke of Argyll. The standard Campbell tartan is the Black Watch tartan.\n\nIn June 1847, a highly critical review of the \"Vestiarium Scoticum\" was published in the \"Quarterly Review\". Though the review was initially published anonymously, now the authors are now known to have been Professor George Skene of Glasgow University and Rev. Dr. Mackay, the editor of the Highland Society's Gaelic Dictionary.\n\nThe \"Quarterly Review\" article was occasioned by the appearance of a book by John Sobieski and Charles Edward Stuart entitled \"The Tales of the Century\". These stories, although presented in fictional terms, lay out the authors' claims to be direct descendants of Prince Charles Edward, the Young Pretender. The \"Quarterly Review\" article, while nominally a response to these claims, in fact mainly consisted of an examination of the authenticity of the \"Vestiarium Scoticum\".\n\nIn 1848, John Sobieski Stuart replied to the \"Quarterly Review\" article with a treatise of his own entitled \"The Genuineness of the Vestiarium Scoticum\". In this reply, Stuart offered the 1721 edition for inspection. In his part, Skene expressed a desire for the original manuscript, which was said to have once belonged to Bishop Ross, to be exhibited. In the end, no record of anyone examining the 1721 copy at that time exists, and no one, other than the Sobieski Stuart brothers, ever saw the Ross copy.\n\nIn 1895, the \"Glasgow Herald\" published a series of articles titled \"The \"Vestiarium Scoticum\", is it a forgery?\" authored by Andrew Ross. Ross was able to locate the 1721 copy, but not any earlier manuscripts. He gave a detailed description of the 1721 copy, and had it subjected to chemical testing by Stevenson Macadam, a chemist. Macadam reported that the \"document [bore] evidence of having been treated with chemical agents in order to give the writing a more aged appearance than it is entitled to\". He concluded that \"the manuscript cannot be depended upon as an ancient document\".\n\nThis 1721 copy was also presented for examination to a Mr. Robert Irvine, the director of a chemical firm who reported that it was \"impossible to arrive at any accurate conclusion pointing to the age of the writing\".\n\nIn earlier years, there was some discussion of publishing a second edition of the \"Vestiarium Scoticum\" (the first edition had a press run of only several dozen copies), but nothing came of these discussions.\n\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n"}
