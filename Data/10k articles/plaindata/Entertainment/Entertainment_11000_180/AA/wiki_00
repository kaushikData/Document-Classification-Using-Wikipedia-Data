It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 16, 1993. In the episode, Springfield decides to legalize gambling to revitalize its economy. A casino owned by Mr. Burns is created and Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. Meanwhile, Marge develops a gambling addiction, Bart starts his own casino, and Burns develops an odd personality in a parody of Howard Hughes.\n\nThe episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. The episode features cultural references to the films \"\", \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Rain Man\", and \"\". Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.7, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\nThe economy of Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to suggestions from citizens on how to improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that it can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinating in jars, and wearing tissue boxes instead of shoes.\n\nDue to her addiction, Marge spends every waking moment at the casino and neglects her family. For instance, she forgets to help Lisa make a costume for her geography pageant. Enraged, Homer bursts into the casino and barges around searching for Marge. The security cameras capture Homer's rampage, and when Mr. Burns sees him he demotes him back to his old job at the power plant. After realizing how much he misses the plant, Mr. Burns decides to return. Homer confronts Marge with her behavior, and she finally realizes that she has a problem. Lisa does win a special prize in the geography pageant, as Homer's poor costume design gives Lisa the appearance that she did the work all by herself. Ralph receives the same prize, as his costume is simply a note taped to his shirt that reads \"Idaho\".\n\nThe episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. The story of the episode originated from a newspaper article that Oakley and Weinstein found about a town in Mississippi that was introducing riverboat gambling. Oakley said another inspiration for it was that there had not been many episodes about Springfield as a whole and how \"crummy\" the town was, so they filled the whole first act with scenes showing how \"crummy\" and \"dismal\" Springfield was. Oakley particularly liked the animation of the lights inside the casino on the slot machines and the lamps in the ceiling. The \"way they radiate out\" had always amazed him. Archer, who directed the animation of the episode, also thought they turned out well. The lights were especially hard for them to animate back then because the show was animated traditionally on cels, so Archer was pleased with the results. A deleted scene from the episode shows Homer dealing cards to James Bond. The staff liked the scene, so they decided to put it in the clip show episode \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\".\n\nThere was a brief period when the episode had a different subplot that revolved around the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood. Groening had been told by a spokesperson that if he put Planet Hollywood in \"The Simpsons\", the creators of the restaurant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Sylvester Stallone, would agree to make guest appearances on the show. The writers of \"The Simpsons\" were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, they were unable to appear in the episode.\nInstead, Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. Executive producer David Mirkin enjoyed directing Goulet because he was \"such a good sport\" and had \"a great sense of humor\". Oakley thought it was nice that Goulet was willing to make fun of himself in the episode, which at the time was rare for guest stars on \"The Simpsons\". This episode features the first appearances of Gunter and Ernst, the Siegfried and Roy-esque casino magicians who are attacked by their white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years after this episode first aired, Roy Horn was attacked by one of the duo's white tigers. \"The Simpsons\" production team dismissed the novelty of the prediction by saying that it was \"bound to happen\" sooner or later. The Rich Texan also makes his debut appearance in this episode, referred to as \"Senator\" by Homer.\n\nThe title is a reference to the 1964 film \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\", the music of which was composed by Laurie Johnson. Two of his songs, \"Happy-go-lively\" and \"Rue de la park\" can be heard within the News on Parade segment at the beginning of the episode. Burns' bed looks similar to the one occupied by Keir Dullea's character Dave Bowman in the end of the 1968 film, \"\". Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise appear at the casino to reprise their roles from the 1988 film \"Rain Man\". Homer is impressed by the card-counting abilities of a man who resembles Raymond Babbitt, Hoffman's character in the film. Krusty's show at midnight is similar to Bill Cosby's 1971 album \"For Adults Only\", which was recorded at a casino at midnight. Marge reminds Homer that his lifelong dream was to be a contestant on the television show \"The Gong Show\".\n\nBurns's paranoid obsession with germs and cleanliness, and his refusal to leave his bedroom once the casino opens, parodies American magnate Howard Hughes, who had obsessive-compulsive disorder, and was involved in the casino business in his later years. The \"Spruce Moose\", an absurdly tiny wooden plane Burns makes in the episode, is a parody of Hughes' impractically enormous wooden plane, derisively nicknamed the \"Spruce Goose\". Homer parodies the scene in the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\" when the Scarecrow demonstrates his newly acquired intelligence by (incorrectly) reciting the law that governs the lengths of the sides of an isosceles triangle. Unlike in the film, somebody correctly points out that the Pythagorean theorem recited applies only to right triangles, not all isosceles triangles.\n\nIn its original American broadcast, \"$pringfield\" finished 35th in the ratings for the week of December 13 to December 19, 1993, with a Nielsen Rating of 11.7, translating to 11 million households. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \"this excellent episode includes a surprising number of concurrent plots. Homer also works in the casino and tries to care for the family without Marge. It balances them deftly and provides great laughs along the way.\" Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the third best episode of the season. He also praised the episode's cultural references. The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \"There's a lovely nod to the earlier episodes in which Marge protests the citizenry's hare-brained ideas at council meetings. A series of bizarre moments rather than a story—we're especially fond of Homer's photographic memory and Mr Burns' descent into insanity—but great fun.\" Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5. The episode is Sarah Culp of \"The Quindecim\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s eleventh-favorite episode of the show, and one of Les Winan of Box Office Prophets's favorite episodes. A scene from the episode where former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger meets Burns was included in the 2002 documentary film \"The Trials of Henry Kissinger\".\n\n"}

{"id": "3144041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3144041", "title": "Adolphe Appia", "text": "Adolphe Appia\n\nAdolphe Appia (1 September 1862 – 29 February 1928), son of Red Cross co-founder Louis Appia, was a Swiss architect and theorist of stage lighting and décor.\n\nAppia is best known for his many scenic designs for Wagner’s operas. He rejected painted two-dimensional sets for three-dimensional \"living\" sets because he believed that shade was as necessary as light to form a connection between the actor and the setting of the performance in time and space. Through the use of control of light intensity, colour and manipulation, Appia created a new perspective of scene design and stage lighting.\n\nDirectors and designers have both taken great inspiration from the work of Adolphe Appia, whose design theories and conceptualizations of Wagner’s operas have helped to shape modern perceptions of the relationship between the performance space and lighting. One of the reasons for the influence of Appia’s work and theories, is that he was working at time when electrical lighting was just evolving. Another is that he was a man of great vision who was able to conceptualize and philosophize about many of his practices and theories.\n\nThe central principle underpinning much of Appia’s work is that artistic unity is the primary function of the director and the designer. Appia maintained that two dimensional set painting and the performance dynamics it created, was the major cause of production disunity in his time. He advocated three elements as fundamental to creating a unified and effective mise en scene:\n(Brockett 1994)\n\nAppia saw light, space and the human body as malleable commodities which should be integrated to create a unified mise en scene. He advocated synchronicity of sound, light and movement in his productions of Wagner’s operas and he tried to integrate corps of actors with the rhythms and moods of the music. Ultimately however, Appia considered light as the primary element which fused together all aspects of a production and he consistently attempted to unify musical and movement elements of the text and score to the more mystical and symbolic aspects of light. He often tried to have actors, singers and dancers start with a strong symbolic gesture or movement and end with another strong symbolic pose or gesture. In his productions, light was ever changing, manipulated from moment to moment, from action to action. Ultimately, Appia sought to unify stage movement and the use of space, stage rhythm and the mise en scene.\n\nAppia was one of the first designers to understand the potential of stage lighting to do more than merely illuminate actors and painted scenery. His ideas about the staging of \"word-tone drama\", together with his own stagings of Tristan und Isolde (Milan 1923) and parts of the Ring (Basle 1924-25) have influenced later stagings, especially those of the second half of the twentieth century.\n\nFor Appia and for his productions, the mise en scene and the totality or unity of the performance experience was primary and he believed that these elements drove movement and initiated action more than any thing else (Johnston 1972). Appia’s designs and theories went on to inspire many other theatre creators such as Edward Gordon Craig, Jacques Copeau and Wieland Wagner.\n\nSee also the articles about Appia written by Prince Serge Wolkonsky (in Russian Wiki)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3301945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3301945", "title": "Anti-siphoning law", "text": "Anti-siphoning law\n\nAnti-siphoning laws and regulations are designed to prevent pay television broadcasters from buying monopoly rights to televise important and culturally significant events before free-to-air television has a chance to bid on them. The theory is that if such a monopoly was allowed, then those unable or unwilling to obtain access to the pay television service would be unable to view the important and culturally significant events. Generally the laws allow pay-TV to bid for such monopoly rights only if free-to-air television has declined to bid on them.\n\nNotable examples of such policies are present in Australia and the United Kingdom. Anti-siphoning in the United States was introduced by the FCC in 1975 and was soon overturned as unconstitutional. Some sports leagues do contractually obligate that their broadcasters include a certain number of telecasts on over-the-air television as part of their overall contracts. For games broadcast exclusively by pay television channels, the National Football League similarly requires syndicated, over-the-air simulcasts in the markets of the teams involved, to ensure that all of a team's games are available locally on broadcast television.\n\nAnti-siphoning laws in Australia cover specific listed events, such as all Olympic Games and the Commonwealth Games, the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup, and Rugby League World Cup finals, events in major sports (such as association football, cricket, and rugby tests) that involve Australian senior national teams or are hosted by Australia, and culturally-significant events such as the Australian Football League and National Rugby League premierships, the State of Origin series, all games in the Australian Open, the Melbourne Cup horse race, the Bathurst 1000, the Australian Grand Prix, and the Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix among others.\n\nIndian law requires all sporting events of \"national importance\" to be simulcast by the state-owned terrestrial channel DD National if their rights are held by a pay television service. Tata Sky, a DTH satellite provider co-owned with Star Sports, challenged the rule, arguing that it devalued its exclusive rights to these events, since all television providers must carry DD National by law. In 2017, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the \"must-share\" provision applies only to terrestrial television and DD Free Dish, and that pay television providers may not re-transmit these telecasts from DD National, thus requiring customers of these services to subscribe to the respective pay channel.\n\nIn November 2012, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) approved draft \"must-have\" regulations, requiring designated events to be carried by free-to-air channels:\n\n\nThe Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events regulates that coverage of certain major sporting events (known as \"Category A\" events, covering certain major domestic events and major international competitions such as the Olympics and FIFA World Cup) must be broadcast primarily on a free-to-air channel (but can share coverage with pay channels), while certain events known as \"Category B\" events can be shown on pay channels, but supplemental coverage (such as highlights or a delayed broadcast) must be provided by a free-to-air channel.\n\nIn the early days of cable television the Federal Communications Commission refused to regulate it. In 1958 the FCC ruled that cable TV was not a common carrier and thus is not subject to FCC jurisdiction. In 1960 the FCC lobbied \"against\" placing cable TV under its jurisdiction, arguing that the administrative burden is inadequate to low perceived threats of unchecked cable development. In 1965 the FCC changed its stance and imposed must-carry rules, requiring cable providers to carry local free-to-air channels, and banned importation of distant channels that duplicated content available on local free-to-air channels.\n\nIn the end of the 1960s the public and the government raised concerns that cable operators can outbid free-to-air channels and \"siphon\" popular content, first of all sports, off the free air. Specific events like the Super Bowl were deemed particularly vulnerable due to greater inelasticity of demand.\n\nIn 1975 the FCC imposed anti-siphoning regulations that limited the operations of sports and film channels. Under the regulations, cable channels could not devote more than 90% of their time to film and sports, and could not broadcast films less than three years old. Specific (i.e. annual) sporting events could not be \"siphoned off\" by cable at all if they had been broadcast on free airwaves during any of the previous five years. Cable coverage of regular season games in popular championships was limited so that only a fraction of all games could be shown on cable. Should sports coverage on free-to-air channels decrease, stipulated the FCC, cable operators had to decrease their sports programming proportionately. Administrative record, however, did not support FCC allegations of \"siphoning\".\n\nThe Department of Justice and a number of cable providers contested the FCC ruling in courts as unconstitutional. In 1977 the DC Circuit Court consolidated these cases in \"Home Box Office vs. the FCC\" and found that the FCC trespassed over the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. The court ruled that cable bandwidth is not a scarce resource, thus it is not subject to limitations allowed by the \"Red Lion vs. the FCC\" ruling. The court applied the O'Brien test (the FCC failed two of its four \"prongs\") and found that the degree of limitation of free speech imposed by the FCC was inadequate, \"grossly overboard\" and thus \"arbitrary, capricious and unconstitutional\".\n\nIn recent years, a growing number of major domestic and international sporting events previously aired by free-to-air channels have migrated to pay-TV outlets. Since 2007, excluding the World Series, Major League Baseball's postseason playoffs have largely moved to cable, while ESPN airs the majority of bowl games of college football (including the College Football Playoff and National Championship, and those owned and operated by its subsidiary ESPN Events). Three of the Grand Slams are aired exclusively by ESPN (the French Open is held by Tennis Channel and NBC), and the majority of regional broadcasts in major leagues are now shown primarily by regional sports networks (with relatively few or no games broadcast on local free-to-air TV unless it is either nationally televised or only aired over-the-air due to RSN rights conflicts).\n\nSome experts have attributed the decline of professional boxing to the move of boxing from FTA network television to premium pay-television, with boxing matches almost exclusively being shown on HBO, Showtime, or pay-per-view and ownership consolidated to those networks and a few selective promotion organizations.\n\nRatings for college football's national championship, NASCAR's Sprint Cup championship race, tennis majors, and golf's Open Championship have suffered from the siphoning to ESPN. NASCAR's new 2015-24 television contract with Comcast's NBCUniversal for NBC and their cable network NBC Sports Network during the second half of the season requires the broadcast of the championship race to be on NBC, where in previous years it only aired on ESPN. Likewise, golf's The Open Championship returned to network television in 2016, with weekend coverage on NBC and early round coverage on Golf Channel. Both the Premier League and The Open are unique in that network television coverage is available in the United States, while their home country is on pay television.\n\nThe National Football League implements an anti-siphoning policy as part of its television contracts. The majority of Sunday games are broadcast on over-the-air television by either CBS or Fox in order to reach the largest audience possible, although the games broadcast during the main afternoon windows are determined by the viewer's region, and viewers must purchase the out-of-market sports package NFL Sunday Ticket (which is carried exclusively by DirecTV) in order to view games that are not shown in their region. Certain flagship games are also broadcast nationally on network television, including NBC's weekly \"Sunday Night Football\", as well as the three annual Thanksgiving Day games, and the entirety of the post-season.\n\nESPN's \"Monday Night Football\", as well as selected \"Thursday Night Football\" games on NFL Network, are only televised nationally on pay television. In these cases, NFL rules require simulcasts of the games to be syndicated to television stations within the home markets of the teams that are participating. This ensures that the games are still available on broadcast TV in the local markets, whilst maintaining cable exclusivity for the games outside of the market. Beginning in 2014, ESPN has also held rights to a post-season wild card game; in the first year of this arrangement, the game was only simulcast in the markets of the teams involved, as with its other games. However, in 2015, ESPN announced that it would begin to simulcast the game nationally on ABC (which returned the NFL to the network for the first time since Super Bowl XL) instead.\n\nThe \"Thursday Night Football\" package previously aired exclusively on NFL Network. The package generated a major controversy in December 2007, due to a Saturday-night game in the package between the New England Patriots and New York Giants, where the Patriots were vying to become the first team since 1972 to have completed the regular season with a perfect record. At the time, NFL Network was not carried by all major television providers (Comcast and Time Warner Cable insisted that they be able to carry NFL Network on a sports tier), and concerns were expressed by critics, such as then Senator John Kerry, that the \"historic\" game would not be available to the majority of viewers outside of the teams' markets (where the game was to air on WWOR-TV, WCVB-TV, and WMUR-TV) if it were not nationally-televised on broadcast television. The NFL compromised by allowing CBS and NBC to simulcast the game, in addition to the three team market stations and NFL Network; commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the decision was \"in the best interest of our fans.\" The arrangement did generate some controversy among broadcasters; WWOR owner Fox Television Stations and WCVB/WMUR owner Hearst-Argyle Television argued that the simulcast devalued what would have been their exclusive local rights.\n\nIn 2014, as part of an overall effort to increase the prominence of the Thursday games, several of the games began to be broadcast and co-produced by CBS, in simulcast with NFL Network. In the 2016 and 2017 seasons, this block of games began to be split between CBS and NBC, but moved to Fox in 2018.\n\n"}

Modern Biblical storytelling as a discipline may be traced to Tom Boomershine, a longtime professor at United Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio who experimented with the idea of memorising stories in the Bible and performing them during his years in seminary. In 1977, he together with Gil Bartholomew (now Adam Bartholomew) then went to begin the Network of Biblical Storytellers (NBS). Biblical storytelling guilds began to form internationally, with one forming in Australia in 1990, one in Canada in 1996, and later ones in the United Kingdom and in Singapore. Boomershine was also the founder and former chair of the Bible in Ancient and Modern Media group in the Society of Biblical Literature, which researches the art and practice of Biblical storytelling in the ancient and modern world as well as how different media have been and continue to be used to disseminate Biblical material.\n\nThe term memorization is rarely used when describing storytelling because it usually is taken to mean rote learning. Instead the process is described as 'internalization' or 'committing to deep memory'. As a result of this process the general expectation is that the storyteller will be able to tell the story with 95% content accuracy and 75% verbal accuracy. Techniques may be used as follows:\n\nPresenting a story from the Bible borrows many techniques from acting, yet in many ways it is quite a distinct art form. Instead of solely taking on one character, the storyteller describes the entire scene in the imagination of the audience. Because storytelling is usually done without many props or sets, this requires the storyteller to visualise the scene of the story in order to describe it physically whilst telling the story. A number of techniques may be used:\n\nMuch of Biblical Storytelling is done as a single storyteller learning one story from the Bible and performing it:\n\nAt events where storytellers are gathering together, an \"Epic Storytelling\" may be set where different parts of the longer story are distributed to those coming together before the gathering and the epic story is told at the event with each of the storytellers telling their sections.\n\nIn a theatrical Biblical Storytelling performance with multiple storytellers, there may be only one \"speaking\" storyteller at a time, so the other storytellers may be used to enhance the telling in the following ways:\n\n\n"}

George Takei endorsed the series and the Indiegogo campaign in early August, 2014, posting that people should fund it. The post on Facebook stated, \"This is an excellent new Web series in the final hours of its crowd funding campaign.

What can change hearts and minds are stories.\" This series, acting as one of those stories, brings more attention to the BSA's policy of excluding gay men serving in leadership positions.\n\nSimon continued, \"I hope this series will help bring back some interest in the Boy Scouts. We need an organization to train our future leaders; leaders that believe in the power of equality. I hope I can one day join the troop and give back to the organization that gave me so much.\"\n"}
{"id": "3350844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3350844", "title": "Club Nintendo", "text": "Club Nintendo\n\nClub Nintendo was the name of several publications and a better-known customer loyalty program provided by Nintendo. The loyalty program was free to join and provided rewards in exchange for consumer feedback and loyalty to purchasing official Nintendo products. Members of Club Nintendo earned credits or \"coins\" by submitting codes found on Nintendo products and systems, which could be traded in for special edition items only available on Club Nintendo. Rewards included objects such as playing cards, tote bags, controllers, downloadable content, and warranty extensions on select Nintendo products.\n\nOn January 20, 2015, it was announced that Club Nintendo would be discontinued in North America on June 30, 2015 and in Europe and Japan on September 30, 2015 due to an upcoming new loyalty program. \"Flipnote Studio 3D\" later became available to all North American Club Nintendo members for free for a limited time, and users who signed up to the European version of the new loyalty program during the launch period received Flipnote Studio 3D for free.\n\nOn March 17, 2015, after suddenly announcing their business partnership venture with DeNA, Nintendo stated that they were working with them on a new, cross-platform membership service called My Nintendo to supersede Club Nintendo for the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch, alongside other devices such as tablets, smartphones and PCs. It was initially launched in Japan on March 17, 2016, alongside Nintendo's first mobile title, \"Miitomo\".\n\nIn Europe, \"Club Nintendo\" was the name of three magazines which started publishing in 1989. The European version was published in several languages, and there were separate publications for Germany, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Italy and Slovenia. All were later discontinued and eventually replaced. The last German issue was published in August 2002.\n\n\"Club Nintendo\" is the name of the official Nintendo magazine in Mexico. The magazine was founded in December 1990 by José \"Pepe\" Sierra and Gustavo \"Gus\" Rodríguez. It was the first magazine in Mexico about Nintendo made by fans of video games, and quickly became the leading game magazine in Mexico.\n\nIn Australia \"Club Nintendo\" was a magazine that started in 1991 and was published by Catalyst Publishing in Melbourne. Roughly 31 pages in length, it featured very few screenshots of games. Australia eventually received their own version of Nintendo Magazine System by which time this magazine had ceased. Catalyst Publishing later took over Nintendo Magazine System in 1996 from the previous publisher.\n\nThe Club Nintendo loyalty program offers rewards to members who collect points (sometimes referred to as \"Stars\" or \"Star Points\", the program is also commonly known as the Stars Catalogue; the North American Club uses \"Coins\") which are gained primarily by purchasing and registering certain first-party hardware and software titles by Nintendo. Points are also awarded for the purchase of select third-party titles, and can also be obtained by participating in surveys, inviting others to become a Club Nintendo member or even simply visiting a web site.\n\nRewards range from digital content such as computer wallpaper, music and mobile phone ringtones, to physical items such as keyrings, calendars, T-shirts and other clothing items, to premium items such as soundtrack albums and game controllers. Some of the premium rewards included Club Nintendo exclusive video games, offered as either digital content (WiiWare, DSiWare) or a physical item (Wii, DS) depending on how, on a game by game basis, they were offered. Many reward items were exclusive to particular Club Nintendo territories, and physical items sometimes were only available in limited quantities.\n\nClub Nintendo (Japanese: クラブニンテンドー) is an official Nintendo club for Japanese fans. It launched on October 31, 2003 and was the second Nintendo reward program to be set (Coming after the European Nintendo VIP 24:7 program) but was the first to be called Club Nintendo.\n\nThe Japanese Club Nintendo offers rewards such as Wii Remotes with television remote control functionality, exclusive and unreleased to market games such as \"Tingle's Balloon Fight DS\" and \"Exclamation Warriors Sakeburein\", game soundtrack CDs (like Touch! Generations Soundtrack) and exclusive accessories such as a Super Famicom style Classic Controller for the Wii.\n\nClub Nintendo in Europe was launched as Nintendo VIP 24:7 on May 3, 2002, to coincide with the European launch of the Nintendo GameCube. It promised exclusive news, reviews, previews and forums to members. However, because released titles are often delayed in European countries (usually due to localization), the exclusive features could be often found elsewhere on the Internet. To coincide with the release of the Wii, VIP 24:7 was renamed to Club Nintendo and adopted the Japanese Club Nintendo logo.\n\nThe Club Nintendo of Europe featured a Star Points system, where members could exchange stars earned by registering games and consoles for items in the Stars Catalogue, and for Wii Points to use in the Wii Shop Channel, which were available only in sets of 100, 300, 500 and 1000 Points. Originally, a maximum of two Wii Points Cards per day and per account were available for purchase; this later changed to one a day. Starting in September 2008, stars could also be used to buy singles and albums at the music online store, emusu.com, a website of which has shutdown.\n\nMembers enter PIN codes found on inserts included with certain games and hardware to earn stars. These can range from 100 to 1000 stars in value. Upon registering as a member on Nintendo of Europe's website, one is rewarded with 250 stars. Encouraging other people to register with Nintendo of Europe earns members 250 stars per sign-up. After registering, members can choose to receive special emails from Nintendo, which can include surveys which also reward members with stars. Daily visits to the website also once earned members 5 stars per day, but this was later removed.\n\nIn 2002, a registration program titled My Nintendo (not to be confused with the loyalty program of the same name, \"My Nintendo\") began in North America. It allowed consumers to register their games and consoles online using a printed code included with the products, with no direct physical rewards or benefits for doing so. Questions began being raised over Club Nintendo's conspicuous absence in the region by 2005. In 2007, then-vice president of Marketing and Corporate Affairs for Nintendo of America Inc. (NOA) Perrin Kaplan stated that the inclusion area of the United States is much larger than all the other Club Nintendo countries, and that the program was considered prohibitively expensive to set up. Kaplan also said that the company considered the pre-order bonuses and game registration promos it offered were an alternative to Club Nintendo. Nintendo of America ultimately relented due to customer demand and announced a Club Nintendo program for North America in October 2008.\n\nThe program was launched on December 15, 2008, retiring the My Nintendo registration program. The site experienced high traffic at its initial launch, resulting in login problems and slow load times for users. It was taken offline on December 24, 2008, reopening almost a week later on December 30 with noticeable infrastructure improvements. The North America catalog was developed in conjunction with Nintendo Australia and uses Coins instead of Stars.\n\nProgram participants who meet 300-Coin \"Gold\" or 600-Coin \"Platinum\" benchmarks within the Club Nintendo year (July 1–June 30) also receive exclusive items. Platinum Rewards are usually premium items, such as plush hats or posters. However, in 2014, there were no physical rewards for either Platinum or Gold, instead a selection of Wii/3DS games which were already released on the eShop were offered. In the past, some of the most notable Platinum Member rewards were a special standalone WiiWare version of \"Punch-Out!!\" titled \"Doc Louis's Punch-Out!!\" and a plastic statuette featuring the main characters from the \"Mario\" games.\n\nIn 2011, Nintendo of America started offering download codes for downloadable games as rewards, available for the Nintendo 3DS and the Wii U consoles as well as the Wii or the Wii U via Wii Mode, of which would typically range from 100 to 250 coins. There were eight games offered (originally two to four), which would change roughly each month. When orders for the non-game rewards were closed from April 18, 2014 until May 13, 2014, 5 different games were added, making a total of 9 games.\n\nClub Nintendo in Australia was launched on April 24, 2008 to coincide with the release of \"Mario Kart Wii\", with the website, catalogue and product registration going live on March 11, 2009 using the same system offered by Nintendo of Europe. Nintendo Australia asserted that the Australian Club Nintendo reward catalogue would be unique from that of Club Nintendo Europe and Club Nintendo Japan, and was developed in conjunction with Nintendo of America. However, unlike its North American counterpart, the Australian service used Stars instead of Coins - the same as its European counterpart.\n\nMost games either distributed or published by Nintendo Australia after \"Mario Kart Wii\" contained a card that allows buyers to register their games for Club Nintendo points.\n\nClub Nintendo Australia was available for both Australians and New Zealanders, as Nintendo Australia manages Nintendo's operations in New Zealand as well. \n\nClub Nintendo launched in South Africa in June 2008.\n\nClub Nintendo was also the name given to a customer service program operating in Spain in the 1990s. Players buying a console, a video game or an accessory were able to fill a form and send it to Nintendo's headquarters in the country by mail. After doing it, the player would receive a Club Nintendo plastic card with their name, an associate number, the image of Mario and Nintendo's logo. The main purpose of this was to receive telephone support about clues and tricks on how to progress through the games and being able to receive the Club Nintendo magazine for free during a year.\n\nSome criticism came from the fact that the Nintendo of Europe Stars Catalogue was only available to members in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy and later Portugal and Russia. Bergsala, which was responsible for all Nintendo-related distribution in Scandinavia, closed down Club Nintendo in the region at the end of the year 2006 because it was not economically viable to keep it going.\nIn 2014, the American Club Nintendo came under fire for offering only digital games for its Platinum and Gold members, who need to spend lots of money to get to that position and were offered games they had already purchased. During the same timeframe, news sites repeatedly pointed out that Nintendo of America's offerings were much smaller than that of Europe and Japan. Digital Downloads were only available on the European (UK) Club Nintendo from the middle of March 2015 compared to the American Club Nintendo that had them for two additional months.\n\nOn January 20, 2015, Nintendo announced that it would be discontinuing Club Nintendo in all regions during the year, and succeeding it with a new loyalty program that the company has named My Nintendo. Prior to this announcement, in September 2014 the company had major changes done to the Japanese edition of Club Nintendo, including abolishing member rank and making hardware ineligible for registration, including then-upcoming New Nintendo 3DS. This was later partially reflected on the Australian Club Nintendo, as members could not register the New Nintendo 3DS either, which was available in the region since November 2014. Throughout 2014, the North American Club Nintendo was experiencing a great lack of physical rewards compared to other regions.\n\nIn North America on February 2, 2015, Nintendo released a final batch of games with 117 titles (118 with the Club Nintendo exclusive title \"Grill-Off with Ultra Hand!\", which was previously available). Among the final batch of games was also \"Doc Louis's Punch-Out!!\", another previous Club Nintendo exclusive title. On January 20, 2015, products released after the date were not eligible for registration with Club Nintendo. The final day to earn Coins, register products with Club Nintendo, or sign up for new Club Nintendo membership was on March 31, 2015. In Europe, the final day was on October 1, 2015.\n\n is a Loyalty program provided by Nintendo, and the successor to Club Nintendo. The system rewards allows players to earn points from using software or purchasing games, which can then be spent on rewards such as digital games or discounts. The program launched on March 17, 2016 in Japan and March 31, 2016 in the rest of the world, launching alongside Nintendo's first mobile app, \"Miitomo\".\n"}
{"id": "303749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303749", "title": "Comcast", "text": "Comcast\n\nComcast Corporation (formerly registered as Comcast Holdings) is an American global telecommunications conglomerate headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is the second-largest broadcasting and cable television company in the world by revenue and the largest pay-TV company, the largest cable TV company and largest home Internet service provider in the United States, and the nation's third-largest home telephone service provider. Comcast services U.S. residential and commercial customers in 40 states and in the District of Columbia. As the owner of the international media company NBCUniversal since 2011, Comcast is a producer of feature films and television programs intended for theatrical exhibition and over-the-air and cable television broadcast, respectively.\n\nComcast owns and operates the Xfinity cable communications subsidiary, over-the-air national broadcast network channels (NBC and Telemundo), multiple cable-only channels (including MSNBC, CNBC, USA Network, NBCSN, and E!, among others), the film studio Universal Pictures, and Universal Parks & Resorts. It also has significant holdings in digital distribution, such as thePlatform, which it acquired in 2006. In February 2014, the company agreed to merge with Time Warner Cable in an equity swap deal worth $45.2 billion, under the terms of the agreement, Comcast was to acquire 100% of Time Warner Cable. However, on April 24, 2015, Comcast terminated the agreement. Comcast and Charter Communications entered into an agreement to conduct exclusive discussions with Sprint Corporation in late June 2017. Since October 2018, it is also the parent company of mass media pan-European company Sky, making it the biggest and leading media company with more than 53 million subscribers over five countries across Europe. \n\nComcast has been criticized for multiple reasons; its customer satisfaction often ranks among the lowest in the cable industry. In addition, Comcast has violated net neutrality practices in the past; and, despite Comcast's commitment to a narrow definition of net neutrality, critics advocate a definition which precludes any distinction between Comcast's private network services and the rest of the Internet. Critics also point out a lack of competition in the vast majority of Comcast's service area; there is limited competition among cable providers. Furthermore, given Comcast's negotiating power as a large ISP, some suspect that Comcast could leverage paid peering agreements to unfairly influence end-user connection speeds. And its ownership of both content production (in NBCUniversal) and content distribution (as an ISP) has raised antitrust concerns. These issues, in addition to others, led to Comcast being dubbed \"The Worst Company in America\" by \"The Consumerist\" in 2010 and 2014.\n\nComcast is sometimes described as a family business. Brian L. Roberts, chairman, president, and CEO of Comcast, is the son of founder Ralph Roberts. Roberts owns or controls about 1% of all Comcast shares but all of the Class B supervoting shares, which gives him an \"undilutable 33% voting power over the company\". Legal expert Susan P. Crawford has said this gives him \"effective control over [Comcast's] every step\". In 2010, he was one of the highest paid executives in the United States, with total compensation of about $31 million.\n\nComcast is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and also has corporate offices in Atlanta, Detroit, Denver, Manchester, New Hampshire and New York City. On January 3, 2005, Comcast announced that it would become the anchor tenant in the new Comcast Center in downtown Philadelphia. The skyscraper is the tallest building in Pennsylvania. Comcast has begun construction on a second skyscraper directly adjacent to the original Comcast headquarters in the summer of 2014.\n\nThe company is often criticized by both the media and its own staff for its less upstanding policies regarding employee relations. A 2012 Reddit post written by an anonymous Comcast call center employee eager to share their negative experiences with the public received attention from publications including \"The Huffington Post\". A 2014 investigative series published by \"The Verge\" involved interviews with 150 of Comcast's employees. It sought to examine why the company has become so widely criticized by its customers, the media and even members of its own staff. The series claimed part of the problem is internal and that Comcast's staff endures unreasonable corporate policies. According to the report: \"customer service has been replaced by an obsession with sales; technicians are understaffed while tech support is poorly trained; and the company is hobbled by internal fragmentation.\" A widely read article penned by an anonymous call center employee working for Comcast appeared in November 2014 on \"Cracked\". Titled \"Five Nightmares You Live While Working For America's Worst Company,\" the article also claimed that Comcast is obsessed with sales, doesn't train its employees properly and concluded that \"the system makes good customer service impossible.\"\n\nComcast has also earned a reputation for being anti-union. According to one of the company's training manuals, \"Comcast does not feel union representation is in the best interest of its employees, customers, or shareholders\". A dispute in 2004 with CWA, a labor union that represented many employees at Comcast's offices in Beaverton, Oregon, led to allegations of management intimidating workers, requiring them to attend anti-union meetings and unwarranted disciplinary action for union members. In 2011, Comcast received criticism from Writers Guild of America for its policies in regards to unions.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Comcast has appeared on multiple \"top places to work\" lists. In 2009, it was included on \"CableFAX\" magazine's \"Top 10 Places to Work in Cable\", which cited its \"scale, savvy and vision\". Similarly, the \"Philadelphia Business Journal\" awarded Comcast the silver medal among extra-large companies in Philadelphia, with the gold medal going to partner organization, Comcast-Spectacor. \"The Boston Globe\" found Comcast to be that city's top place to work in 2009. Employee diversity is also an attribute upon which Comcast receives strong marks. In 2008, \"Black Enterprise\" magazine rated Comcast among the top 15 companies for workforce diversity. Comcast was also named a \"Top 2014 Workplace\" by \"The Washington Post\" in their annual feature. the Human Rights Campaign has given Comcast a 100 on the Corporate Equality Index and one of the best places for LGBT people to work\n\nThe book value of the company nearly doubled from $8.19 a share in 1999 to $15 a share in 2009. Revenues grew sixfold from 1999's $6 billion to almost $36 billion in 2009. Net profit margin rose from 4.2% in 1999 to 8.4% in 2009, with operating margins improving 31% and return on equity doubling to 6.7% in the same time span. Between 1999 and 2009, return on capital nearly tripled to 7%. Comcast reported first quarter 2012 profit increases of 30% due to increase in high-speed internet customers. In February 2014, Comcast generated 1.1 billion in revenue during the first quarter due to the Sochi Olympics. As of 2018, Comcast is ranked No. 33 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2017, Comcast reported earnings of US$22.7 billion, with an annual revenue of US$84.5 billion, an increase of 5.5% over the previous fiscal cycle. Comcast's shares traded at over $37 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$163.7 billion in October 2018.\nWith $18.8 million spent in 2013, Comcast has the seventh largest lobbying budget of any individual company or organization in the United States. Comcast employs multiple former U.S. Congressmen as lobbyists. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association, which has multiple Comcast executives on its board, also represents Comcast and other cable companies as the fifth largest lobbying organization in the United States, spending $19.8 million in 2013. Comcast was among the top backers of Barack Obama's presidential runs, with Comcast vice president David Cohen raising over $2.2 million from 2007 to 2012. Cohen has been described by many sources as influential in the U.S. government, though he is no longer a registered lobbyist, as the time he spends lobbying falls short of the 20% which requires official registration. Comcast's PAC, the Comcast Corporation and NBCUniversal Political Action Committee, is the among the largest PACs in the U.S., raising about $3.7 million from 2011 to 2012 for the campaigns of various candidates for office in the United States Federal Government. Comcast is also a major backer of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association Political Action Committee, which raised $2.6 million from 2011 to 2012. Comcast spent the most money of any organization in support of the Stop Online Piracy and PROTECT IP bills, spending roughly $5 million to lobby for their passage.\n\nComcast also backs lobbying and PACs on a regional level, backing organizations such as the Tennessee Cable Telecommunications Association and the Broadband Communications Association of Washington PAC. Comcast and other cable companies have lobbied state governments to pass legislation restricting or banning individual cities from offering public broadband service. Municipal broadband restrictions of varying scope have been passed in a total of 20 U.S. States.\n\nComcast offers low cost internet and cable service to schools, subsidized by general broadband consumers through the U.S. government's E-Rate program. Critics have noted that many of the strongest supporters of Comcast's business deals have received substantial funding from the Comcast Foundation.\n\nIn 1963, Ralph J. Roberts in conjunction with his two business partners, Daniel Aaron and Julian A. Brodsky, purchased American Cable Systems as a corporate spin-off from its parent, Jerrold Electronics, for U.S. $500,000. At the time, American Cable was a small cable operator in Tupelo, Mississippi, with five channels and 12,000 customers. In 1965, American Cable Systems purchased Storecast Corporation of America, a product placement supermarket specialist marketing firm. In 1968, American Cable Systems purchased its first franchise of Muzak, a brand of background music played in retail stores. Storecast was a client of Muzak.\n\nThe company was re-incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1969, under the new name Comcast Corporation. Comcast's initial public offering occurred on June 29, 1972, with a market capitalization of U.S. $3,010,000. In 1977, HBO was first launched on a Comcast system with 20,000 customers in western Pennsylvania with a five-night free preview getting a 15% sign up rate. In 1986, Comcast bought 26% of Group W Cable, a broadcast company, doubling its number of subscribers to 1 million. Also that year, Comcast made a founding investment of $380 million in QVC. In 1988, Comcast was able to buy a 50% share of SCI Holdings in a joint deal with Tele-Communications Inc. Comcast also acquired American Cellular Network Corporation in 1988 for $230 million, marking the first time it became a mobile phone operator.\n\nIn February 1990, Ralph Roberts' son, Brian L. Roberts, succeeded his father as president of Comcast. Two years later, the company's mobile division, Comcast Cellular, purchased a controlling interest in Metromedia's Philadelphia-area cellular telephone interests, Metrophone. In 1994, Comcast became the third-largest cable operator in the United States, with around 3.5 million subscribers following its purchase of Maclean-Hunter's American division for $1.27 billion. Comcast grew to 4.3 million the following year with the purchase of the cable operation of E. W. Scripps Company for $1.575 billion in stock. \n\nComcast offered internet connection for the first time in 1996, with its part in the launch of the @Home Network. Also in 1996, Comcast formed Comcast Spectacor, which became owner of the Philadelphia Flyers. In 1997, Microsoft invested $1 billion in Comcast, and the company launched its digital TV service. That same year, in partnership with Disney, Comcast got a 50.1% controlling interest in E! Entertainment. By December 31, 1997, it was available in the Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, Orange County, CA, Sarasota and Union, NJ areas. \n\nComcast's cable acquisitions in 1997 were Jones Intercable, Inc. with 1 million customers, and a stake in Prime Communications with 430,000 subscribers. In February 1998, Comcast sold its U.K. division to NTL for US$600 million, along with the division's $397 million in debt. In 1999, Comcast sold Comcast Cellular to SBC Communications for $400 million, releasing them from $1.27 billion in debt. Also in 1999, Comcast acquired Greater Philadelphia Cablevision, and launched Comcast University as well as Comcast Interactive Capital Group. Later, in November 1999, Comcast purchased Lenfest, a rival cable operator. \n\nIn 2001, Comcast announced it would acquire the assets of the largest cable television operator at the time, AT&T Broadband, for U.S.$44.5 billion. The proposed name for the merged company was \"AT&T Comcast\", but the companies ultimately decided to keep only the Comcast name. In 2002, Comcast acquired all assets of AT&T Broadband, thus making Comcast the largest cable television company in the United States with over 22 million subscribers. This also spurred the start of Comcast Advertising Sales (using AT&T's groundwork) which would later be renamed Comcast Spotlight. As part of this acquisition, Comcast also acquired the National Digital Television Center in Centennial, Colorado as a wholly owned subsidiary, which is today known as the \"Comcast Media Center\". In 2003, Comcast became one of the original investors in The Golf Channel. After Excite@Home went bankrupt in October 2001, Comcast took over providing internet directly to consumers in January 2002. \n\nOn February 11, 2004, Comcast announced a $54 billion bid for The Walt Disney Company, as well as taking on $12 billion of Disney's debt. The deal would have made Comcast the largest media conglomerate in the world. However, after rejection by Disney and uncertain response from investors, the bid was abandoned in April. The main reason for the buyout attempt was so that Comcast could acquire Disney's 80% stake in ESPN, which a Comcast executive called \"the most important and valuable asset\" that Disney owned. In 2004, Comcast sold its QVC shares to Liberty Media for $7.9 billion. \n\nOn April 8, 2005, a partnership led by Comcast and Sony Pictures Entertainment finalized a deal to acquire MGM and its affiliate studio, United Artists, and created an additional outlet to carry MGM/UA's material for cable and Internet distribution. On October 31, 2005, Comcast officially announced that it had acquired Susquehanna Communications a South Central Pennsylvania, -based cable television and broadband services provider and unit of the former Susquehanna Pfaltzgraff company, for $775 million cash. In this deal Comcast acquired approximately 230,000 basic cable customers, 71,000 digital cable customers, and 86,000 high-speed Internet customers. Comcast previously owned approximately 30% of Susquehanna Communications through affiliate company Lenfest. In December 2005, Comcast announced the creation of Comcast Interactive Media, a new division focused on online media.\n\nIn July 2006, Comcast purchased the Seattle-based software company thePlatform. This represented an entry into a new line of business – selling software to allow companies to manage their Internet (and IP-based) media publishing efforts.\n\nOn April 3, 2007, Comcast announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire the cable systems owned and operated by Patriot Media, a privately held company owned by cable veteran Steven J. Simmons, Spectrum Equity Investors and Spire Capital, that serves approximately 81,000 video subscribers. Comcast will acquire Patriot for a net cash investment of approximately $483 million. By acquiring the niche provider the deal will plug a hole in its central New Jersey service.\n\nComcast announced in May 2007 and launched in September 2008 a dashboard called SmartZone. Hewlett-Packard led \"design, creation and management\". Collaboration and unified messaging technology came from open-source vendor Zimbra. \"SmartZone users will be able to send and receive e-mail, listen to their voicemail messages online and forward that information via e-mail to others, send instant messages and video instant messages and merge their contacts into one address book\". There is also Cloudmark spam and phishing protection and Trend Micro antivirus. The address book is Comcast Plaxo software.\n\nIn May 2008 Comcast purchased Plaxo for a reported $150 million to $170 million.\n\nComcast won the \"Consumerist\" Worst Company In America (\"Golden Poo\") award in 2010. A gold trophy in the shape of a pile of human feces was delivered to Comcast Corporate Headquarters to commemorate the unmatched level of enmity flowing from their customer base to their business. Competitor Verizon congratulated Comcast on their award via the Verizon Twitter feed. Comcast responded immediately by publicly acknowledging the dubious award, and citing ongoing efforts to improve its customer service. One effort to change this is a new app called, Tech ETA, that allows customers to see exactly when a technician is coming.\n\nIn April 2005, Comcast and Time Warner Cable announced plans to buy the assets of bankrupted Adelphia Cable. The two companies paid a total of $17.6 billion in the deal that was finalized in the second quarter of 2006—after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed a seven-month investigation without raising an objection. Time Warner Cable became the second-largest cable provider in the U.S., ranking behind Comcast. As part of the deal, Time Warner and Comcast traded existing subscribers in order to consolidate them into larger geographic clusters.\n\nIn August 2006, Comcast and Time Warner dissolved a 50/50 partnership that controlled the systems in the Houston, Southwest Texas, San Antonio, and Kansas City markets under the Time Warner brand. After the dissolution, Comcast obtained the Houston system, and Time Warner retained the others. On January 1, 2007, Comcast officially took control of the Houston system, but continued to operate under the Time Warner Cable brand until June 19, 2007.\n\nMedia outlets began reporting in late September 2009 that Comcast was in talks to buy NBC Universal. Comcast denied the rumors at first, while NBC would not comment on them. However, CNBC itself reported on October 1 that General Electric was considering spinning NBC Universal off into a separate company that would merge the NBC television network and its cable properties such as USA Network, Syfy and MSNBC, as well as Universal Studios, with Comcast's content assets. GE would maintain 49% control of the new company, while Comcast owned 51%. Vivendi, which owns 20%, would have to sell its stake to GE. It was reported that under the current deal with GE that it would happen in November or December. It was also reported that Time Warner would be interested in placing a bid, until CEO Jeffrey L. Bewkes directly denied interest, leaving Comcast the sole bidder. On November 1, 2009, \"The New York Times\" reported Comcast had moved closer to a deal to purchase NBC Universal and that a formal announcement could be made sometime the following week.\n\nFollowing a tentative agreement on December 1, the parties announced that Comcast would buy a controlling 51% stake in NBCUniversal for $6.5 billion in cash and $7.3 billion in programming on December 3. GE would take over the remaining 49% stake in NBC Universal, using $5.8 billion to buy out Vivendi's 20% minority stake in NBC Universal. On January 18, 2011, the FCC approved the deal by a vote of 4 to 1. The sale was completed on January 28, 2011. In late December 2012, Comcast added the NBC peacock symbol to their new logo. On February 12, 2013, Comcast announced an intention to acquire the remaining 49% of General Electric's interest in NBCUniversal, which Comcast completed on March 19, 2013.\n\nOn February 12, 2014, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that Comcast sought to acquire Time Warner Cable in a deal valued at $45.2 billion. On February 13, it was reported that Time Warner Cable agreed to the acquisition. This was to add several metropolitan areas to the Comcast portfolio, such as New York City, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Charlotte, San Diego, and San Antonio. Time Warner Cable and Comcast aimed to merge into one company by the end of 2014 and both have praised the deal, emphasizing the increased capabilities of a combined telecommunications network, and to \"create operating efficiencies and economies of scale\".\n\nIn 2014, critics expressed concern that the deal would give Comcast greater negotiating power in a number of areas, including rebroadcast fees with television channels, and peering agreements with ISPs.\n\nCritics noted in 2013 that Tom Wheeler, the head of the FCC, which has to approve the deal, is the former head of both the largest cable lobbying organization, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, and as largest wireless lobby, CTIA – The Wireless Association. According to \"Politico\", Comcast \"donated to almost every member of Congress who has a hand in regulating it.\" The US Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the deal on April 9, 2014. The House Judiciary Committee planned its own hearing. On March 6, 2014, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division confirmed it was investigating the deal. In March 2014, the division's chairman, William Baer, recused himself because he was involved in the prior Comcast NBCUniversal acquisition. Several states' attorneys general have announced support for the federal investigation. On April 24, 2015, Jonathan Sallet, general counsel of the F.C.C., said that he was going to recommend a hearing before an administrative law judge, equivalent to a collapse of the deal.\n\nIn August 2015, Comcast announced to speed up Internet for low income customers from 5 megabits per second (mbps) to 10 Mbit/s, provide free wireless routers, and will pilot an initiative to increase Internet access for low-income senior citizens. In September of that year Comcast also launched Watchable, a YouTube competitor. The move was seen by Variety as an attempt to appeal to the cord cutting market.\n\nIn April 2016, Comcast confirmed that its NBCUniversal division would acquire DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion. The deal closed on August 22, 2016. Universal Pictures will take over distribution of DreamWorks Animation films beginning in 2019 with \"\" when DreamWorks Animation's deal with 20th Century Fox expires.\n\nIn September 2016, Comcast confirmed that it had reached a partnership with Verizon Wireless to launch a cellular network as an MVNO. The new service, described as being a \"Wi-Fi and MVNO-integrated product\", and was expected to launch in mid-2017. The partnership and the addition of wireless would allow Comcast to offer a quadruple play of services. Including Comcast's Home Security offering, customers now have the option of a Quintuple Play. The service was officially announced on April 6, 2017, as Xfinity Mobile.\n\nOn November 16, 2017, it is reported that Comcast attempted to purchase 21st Century Fox, following the news 10 days earlier that The Walt Disney Company negotiated with Fox to acquire the same assets. Like Disney, the deal included 20th Century Fox, cable entertainment and broadcast satellite networks including FX Networks, National Geographic Partners, Fox Sports Networks, and international channels such as Star India and Sky plc. It would not include the Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Television Stations, Fox Sports, and Fox News units, all which will be spun-off into a new independent company.\n\nHowever, on December 11, 2017, Comcast officially dropped the bid, saying that \"We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.” On December 14, Disney officially confirmed its acquisition of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion in stock, pending review from the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division.\n\nOn February 5, 2018, a new report by CNBC claims that despite the Disney/Fox deal, Comcast is considering topping Disney's $52.4 billion offer once the AT&T–Time Warner merger goes through, after the Department of Justice Antitrust Division sued to block the merger on November 20, 2017.\n\nOn May 7, 2018, Comcast announced a potential bid against Disney's effort to acquire Fox after it spoke to investment banks about making a $60 billion cash offer, pending on approval of the AT&T-Time Warner merger. On May 15, several Fox investors expressed interests in inking a deal with Comcast due to their all-cash offer as opposed to Disney's $52.4 billion stock offer. On June 13, Comcast officially announced a $65 billion counter-offer to acquire the 21st Century Fox's assets that Disney offered to purchase.\n\nHowever, on June 20, 2018, Disney and Fox announced that they had amended their previous merger agreement, upping Disney’s offer to $71.3 billion (a 10% premium over Comcast's $65 billion offer), while also offering shareholders the option of receiving cash instead of stock. On June 27, the United States Department of Justice gave antitrust approval to Disney under the condition of selling Fox's 22 regional sports channels, to which the company has agreed. On the next day, Disney and Fox shareholders scheduled July 27, 2018 as the day to vote on Fox's properties being sold to Disney, giving Comcast enough time to make a higher counter-offer for the assets of Sky.\n\nHowever, on July 12, 2018, the Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal with the D.C. Circuit to reverse the District Court's approval for AT&T acquisition of Time Warner (now WarnerMedia). Although analysts say that the chances of the DOJ win are small, they say it is the \"final nail in the coffin for Comcast's Fox chase. This is a clear gift to Disney\" On the next day, CEO of AT&T Randall Stephenson gave an interview with CNBC, about Comcast's bid for Fox: \"It probably can't help it. You're in a situation where two entities are bidding for an asset, and this kind of action can obviously influence the outcome of those actions.\"\n\nOn July 16, 2018, CNBC reported that Comcast was unlikely to continue its bidding war to acquire Fox from Disney in favor of Sky. On July 19, 2018, Comcast officially announced that it was dropping its bid on the Fox assets in order to focus on their bid for Sky. CEO of Comcast, Brian L. Roberts said “I’d like to congratulate Bob Iger and the team at Disney and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company.\"\n\nOn February 27, 2018, Comcast offered to purchase 61% stake in Sky plc at a value of £12.50 per-share, approximately £22.1 billion. 21st Century Fox, which owns 39% stake in Sky, had previously declined a US$60 billion acquisition offer by Comcast in favour of its deal with Disney, due to anti-competition concerns. NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke stated that purchasing Sky would roughly double its presence in English-speaking markets, and allow for synergies between the respective networks and studios of NBCUniversal and Sky. Fox stated that it \"remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky\", and that Comcast had not yet made a \"firm offer\".\n\nOn April 12, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers ruled that Disney had to acquire all of Sky within 28 days of fully acquiring Fox if the latter's acquisition of Sky is not completed by the time the merger is done, or if Comcast's counter-offer isn't accepted. On April 25, 2018, Comcast made its formal counter-bid for Sky plc, offering £12.50 per-share; Sky subsequently withdrew its recommendation of the Fox bid. On June 5, 2018, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock cleared both 21st Century Fox and Comcast's respective offers to acquire Sky plc. Fox's offer is contingent on the divestiture of Sky News.\n\nOn June 15, 2018, the European Commission gave antitrust clearance to Comcast's offer to purchase Sky, citing that in terms of their current assets in Europe, there would be limited impact on competition. Comcast included a 10-year commitment to the operations and funding of Sky News similar to that of Disney's offer. On June 19, 2018, Disney formally agreed to acquire Sky News as part of Fox's proposed bid, with a 15-year commitment to increase its annual funding from £90 million to £100 million.\n\nOn July 11, 2018, 21st Century Fox raised its bid to purchase Sky plc assets to $32.5 billion, and $18.57 a share. In response, Comcast increased its bid to $34 billion, and $19.5 a share. At the same time, Fox was given clearance by the British government to purchase Sky. On July 18, 2018, \"Bloomberg\" reported that the Sky board scheduled July 27, 2018 as the day shareholders vote on selling Sky properties.\n\nOn September 22, 2018, Comcast outbid 21st Century Fox, by raising its bid for Sky plc to $40 billion, or $22.57 a share. On September 25, 2018, Comcast has bought 30% stake of Sky plc. The next day on September 26, 2018, Fox with the consent of its acquirer sold its 39% stake to Comcast in exchange for $15 billion in cash. In October 2018 Comcast later acquired the rest of the shares of the Sky with the company being dislisted in November. The merger closed on November 7 with the company being dislisted after becoming a wholly owned subsidiary and division of Comcast.\n\nComcast Cable is the cable television division of Comcast Corporation, providing cable television, broadband internet, and landline telephone under the Xfinity brand. Comcast Cable also provides connections to small to medium-sized business through its Comcast Business brand, and Fortune 1000 companies through its Comcast Enterprise brand.\n\nComcast delivers third-party television programming content to its own customers, and also produces its own first-party content both for subscribers and customers of other competing television services. Fully or partially owned Comcast programming includes Comcast Newsmakers, Comcast Network, Comcast SportsNet, SportsNet New York, MLB Network, Comcast Sports Southeast/Charter Sports Southeast, NBC Sports Network, The Golf Channel, Syfy, and USA Network. On May 19, 2009, Disney and ESPN announced an agreement to allow Comcast Corporation to carry the channels ESPNU and ESPN3. The U.S. Olympic Committee and Comcast intended to team up to create The U.S. Olympic Network, which was slated to launch after the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games. These plans were then put on hold by the U.S. Olympic Committee. The U.S. Olympic Committee and Comcast have ended the plans to create The U.S. Olympic Network.\n\nComcast's content networks and assets also include E!, Oxygen, Golf Channel, NBCSN, Universal Kids, Bravo, and the regional Comcast SportsNets. When Comcast took majority ownership in NBCUniversal, significant number of cable networks were added to this list. Comcast's NHL deal obligated them to create a U.S. version of NHL Network, launched in October 2007.\n\nComcast also owns many local channels. Comcast also has a variety network known as Comcast Network, available exclusively to Comcast and Cablevision subscribers. The channel shows news, sports, and entertainment and places emphasis in Philadelphia and the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. areas, though the channel is also available in New York, Pittsburgh, and Richmond. In August 2004, Comcast started a channel called Comcast Entertainment Television, for Colorado Comcast subscribers, and focusing on life in Colorado. It also carries some National Hockey League and National Basketball Association games when Altitude Sports & Entertainment is carrying the NHL or NBA. In January 2006, CET became the primary channel for Colorado's Emergency Alert System in the Denver Metro Area. In 2006, Comcast helped found the channel SportsNet New York, acquiring a minority stake. The other partners in the project were New York Mets and Time Warner Cable.\n\nOn April 28, 2016, NBCUniversal bought DreamWorks Animation, along with its major IPs including \"Shrek\", \"How to Train Your Dragon\", \"Kung Fu Panda\", and \"Madagascar\".\n\nIn 1996, Comcast bought a controlling stake in Spectacor from the company's founder, Ed Snider. Comcast Spectacor holdings now include the Philadelphia Flyers NHL hockey team and their home arena in Philadelphia. Over a number of years, Comcast became majority owner of Comcast SportsNet, as well as Golf Channel and NBCSN (formerly the Outdoor Life Network, then Versus). In 2002, Comcast paid the University of Maryland $25 million for naming rights to the new basketball arena built on the College Park campus, the XFINITY Center. Before it was renamed for Comcast's cable subsidiary, XFINITY Center was called Comcast Center from its opening in 2002 through July 2014. Comcast became the sponsor of NASCAR's second tier series renaming it the NASCAR Xfinity Series in 2015.\n\nComcast founded its first venture capital fund in January 1999, as Comcast Interactive Capital. Around 2011, following the 2009 NBC Universal acquisition, \"Comcast Interactive Capital\" was merged with\" The Peacock Equity Fund\", the venture capital subsidiary of NBCUniversal. The combined company, Comcast Ventures, is led by Amy Banse as Head of Funds \n\nand backs various companies such as FanDuel and Vox Media, for example.\n\nIn 2004 and 2007, the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) survey found that Comcast had the worst customer satisfaction rating of any company or government agency in the country, including the Internal Revenue Service. The ACSI indicates that almost half of all cable customers (regardless of company) have registered complaints, and that cable is the only industry to score below 60 in the ACSI. Comcast's Customer Service Rating by the ACSI surveys indicate that the company's customer service has not improved since the surveys began in 2001. Analysis of the surveys states that \"Comcast is one of the lowest scoring companies in ACSI. As its customer satisfaction eroded by 7% over the past year, revenue increased by 12%.\" The ACSI analysis also addresses this contradiction, stating that \"Such pricing power usually comes with some level of monopoly protection and most cable companies have little competition at the local level. This also means that a cable company can do well financially even though its customers are not particularly satisfied.\"\n\nIn April 2014, Comcast was awarded the 2014 \"Worst Company in America\" award; an annual contest by the consumer affairs blog \"The Consumerist\" that runs a series of reader polls to determine the least popular company in America. This was the second time Comcast had been awarded this title, the first being in 2010.\n\nComcast spends millions of dollars annually on lobbying. Comcast employs the spouses, sons and daughters of mayors, councilmen, commissioners, and other officials to assure its continued preferred market allocations.\n\nComcast was given an \"F\" for its corporate governance practices in 2010, by Corporate Library, an independent shareholder-research organization. According to Corporate Library, Comcast's board of directors ability to oversee and control management was severely compromised (at least in 2010) by the fact that several of the directors either worked for the company or had business ties to it (making them susceptible to management pressure), and a third of the directors were over 70 years of age. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\" nearly two-thirds of the flights of Comcast's $40 million corporate jet purchased for business travel related to the NBCU acquisition, were to CEO Brian Roberts' private homes or to resorts.\n\nOn August 1, 2016, Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit against cable television and Internet giant Comcast Corporation in King County Superior Court, alleging the company’s own documents reveal a pattern of illegally deceiving their customers to pad their bottom line by tens of millions of dollars. The FCC issued a $2.3 million fine to Comcast after finding that the company was charging customers for unordered services and equipment. More than a thousand customers issued complaints about these unprecedented charges to their bill. In addition, numerous customers reported inappropriate name-calling and interrogation by customer service representatives. Comcast’s executive vice president, David Cohen, admitted the company needed to improve their customer service.\n\nOn August 8, 2016 an official Comcast employee confirmed that Comcast was changing native 1080i channels to the 720p60 format. \"Official Employees are from multiple teams within Comcast: Product, Support, Leadership.\"\n\nIn February 2017, Comcast was ordered by the self-regulatory National Advertising Review Board to cease using a claim based on Speedtest.net data that it has \"America's fastest internet\", stating that \"Ookla’s data showed only that Xfinity consumers who took advantage of the free tests offered on the Speedtest.net website subscribed to tiers of service with higher download speeds than Verizon FiOS consumers who took advantage of the tests.\" They were also ordered to stop using a claim that the company offers the \"fastest in-home Wi-Fi\", which was poorly substantiated.\n\n"}
{"id": "3252816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3252816", "title": "Cyber Monday", "text": "Cyber Monday\n\nCyber Monday is a marketing term for the Monday after the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. It was created by retailers to encourage people to shop online. The term was coined by Ellen Davis and Scott Silverman, and made its debut on November 28, 2005 in a Shop.org press release entitled \"'Cyber Monday' Quickly Becoming One of the Biggest Online Shopping Days of the Year\". It is on the Monday after Thanksgiving, and most of the time falls in November, but if Thanksgiving is on November 27 or 28, it will fall in December. The date range is November 26 to December 2, and is always four days after the holiday.\n\nAccording to the Shop.org/Bizrate Research 2005 eHoliday Mood Study, \"77 percent of online retailers said that their sales increased substantially on the Monday after Thanksgiving, a trend that is driving serious online discounts and promotions on Cyber Monday this year (2005)\".\n\nIn 2017, Cyber Monday online sales grew to a record $6.59 billion, compared with $2.98 billion in 2015, and $2.65 billion in 2014. However, the average order value was $128, down slightly from 2014's $160.\n\nCyber Monday has become the online equivalent to Black Friday and offers a way for smaller retail websites to compete with larger chains. Since its inception, it has become an international marketing term used by online retailers across the world.\n\nThe term \"Cyber Monday\" was coined by Ellen Davis, and was first used within the ecommerce community during the 2005 holiday season. According to Scott Silverman, the head of Shop.org, the term was coined based on 2004 research showing \"one of the biggest online shopping days of the year\" was the Monday after Thanksgiving (12th-biggest day historically). Retailers also noted the biggest period was December 5 through 15 of the previous year. In late November 2005, \"The New York Times\" reported: \"The name Cyber Monday grew out of the observation that millions of otherwise productive working Americans, fresh off a Thanksgiving weekend of window shopping, were returning to high-speed Internet connections at work Monday and buying what they liked.\" At the time, a lot of people had slow Internet at home.\n\nIn 2006, comScore reported that online spending on Cyber Monday jumped 25% to $608 million, 21% to $733 million in 2007, and 15% to $846 million in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, comScore reported that online spending increased 5 percent on Cyber Monday to $887 million and that more than half of dollars spent online at US Web sites originated from work computers (52.7 percent), representing a gain of 2.3 percentage points from last year. Buying from home comprised the majority of the remaining share (41.6 percent) while buying from international locations accounted for 5.8 percent. According to comScore chairman Gian Fulgoni, \"comScore data have shown that Cyber Monday online sales have always been driven by considerable buying activity from work locations. That pattern hasn't changed. After returning from the long Thanksgiving weekend with a lot of holiday shopping still ahead of them, many consumers tend to continue their holiday shopping from work. Whether to take advantage of the extensive Cyber Monday deals offered by retailers or to buy gifts away from the prying eyes of family members, this day has become an annual ritual for America's online holiday shoppers.\"\n\nIn 2010, comScore reported the first-ever $1 billion online shopping day ($1028M), an increase of 16 percent over 2009. In 2011, comScore reported that Cyber Week saw US consumers spend over $6 billion online from November 28 to December 2. In 2012, comScore reported that Cyber Monday saw a 17% increase in sales from 2011, totaling $1.465 billion. In 2013, Cyber Monday sales continued their growth and recorded their highest grossing day ever at $2.29 billion.\n\nIn 2014, the average planned expenditure is $361 per person. 46 percent people expect to pay with credit cards and 43 percent expect to pay with debit cards. Sales are up 8.1% as of 6 p.m. ET, according to IBM Digital Analytics. The average order is $131.66, flat with last year, though the number of transactions is up and people are buying more items on average per order.\n\nIn 2016, according to Adobe Digital Insights, Cyber Monday hit a new record with $3.45 billion, and which was the first time that online sales in one single day surpassed $3 billion in US history. The numbers went up 12.1% from the previous year.\n\nU.S. employers have been cracking down on employees using company equipment and company time for non-work-related purposes, including Cyber Monday. As of November 2011, 22% of employers had fired an employee for using the Internet for non-work related activity; 7% of human resource managers surveyed had fired an employee for holiday shopping; and 54% of employers were blocking employees from accessing certain websites. According to CareerBuilder's annual Cyber Monday survey, more than half of workers (53%) say they spend at least some work time holiday shopping on the Internet, up 3% from 2015. Of this group, 43% spend an hour or more doing so, compared to 42% from 2015.\n\nAccording to Argentine press, Cyber Monday was celebrated on November 11, 2014, and marked a tenfold growth in users taking advantage of online sales over the previous year.\n\nCyber Monday came to Canada in 2008. The \"National Post\" featured an article, in the November 25, 2010, edition, stating that the parity of the Canadian dollar with the US dollar caused many Canadian retailers to have Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales of their own. According to the article, an estimated 80% of Canadians were expected to participate in Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. Speculation has been made that with all major US television broadcasters—which are typically available to Canadians—emphasizing Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales for stores that are also doing business in Canada, Canadian retailers needed to mimic sales offerings in order to keep Canadian dollars from being spent in the US.\n\nBy 2011, around 80% of online retailers in Canada were participating in Cyber Monday.\n\nChile's first Cyber Monday took place on November 28, 2011. The companies participating in the event are participants in the Santiago Chamber of Commerce's Electronic Commerce Committee. In 2015 the Chilean Cyber Monday had 85 stores participating, 390.000 transactions and US$83 million in sales. 36% of that was mobile. In 2016 Cyber Monday will be held on November 7. 140 companies are registered as official partners.\n\nThe first Cyber Monday in Colombia took place on November 26, 2012. It was organized by the Colombian Chamber of Electronic Commerce and sponsored by the Ministry of IT and Telecommunications.\n\nIndia got its own version of the Cyber Monday (Great Online Shopping Festival) on December 12, 2012 when Google India partnered with many e-commerce companies including Flipkart, Snapdeal, HomeShop18, Indiatimes shopping, and MakeMyTrip. Google said that this was the first time an industry-wide initiative of this scale was undertaken. In November 2015, Google announced that the event would not be repeated.\n\nAmazon.co.jp announced it registered as Cyber Monday with Japan Anniversary Association in 2012. Amazon.co.jp ran the Cyber Monday Seven Day Sale from Dec 10 through December 16, 2012.\n\nIn Belgium, Cyber Monday has gained popularity since 2016. Due to efforts off several major online shops launching large Cyber Monday campaigns, the average revenue during Cyber Monday has increased with 50% compared to the 2015 edition.\n\nInspired by the U.S. phenomenon, the term Cyber Monday was first used in France in 2008.\n\nAmazon.de announced that it brought Cyber Monday to Germany in 2010. As of 2014, amazon.de continues to advertise Cyber Monday and has extended it to an 8-day period (\"Cyber Monday week\") beginning on the Monday before Thanksgiving.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the term Cyber Monday was first used in 2012. Since then, Dutch online retailers have taken advantage of Cyber Monday in promotional purposes, because it is perfectly timed before the celebration of Sinterklaas which is celebrated by buying gifts for each other in Netherlands. Since 2012, the popularity of Cyber Monday has grown strongly every year in the Netherlands. In total there were 105 participating online stores during the Cyber Monday period of 2017.\n\nIn Portugal, the term Cyber Monday was first used in 2009.\n\nIn Romania, Cyber Monday is the first Monday after Black Friday, which is held by the biggest retailers one week before the US Black Friday.\n\nIn Sweden Cyber Monday is growing rapidly and several of the largest online retailers regularly launch Cyber Monday campaigns. Cyber Monday was first established on larger online retailers in Sweden 2010.\n\nAccording to a 2009 \"The Guardian\" article, UK online retailers are now referring to \"Cyber Monday\" as the busiest internet shopping day of the year that commonly falls on the same day as the US Cyber Monday.\n\nBeginning at 7 pm AEDT on November 20 in 2012, Australian online retailers decided to hold a similar event for the first time, dubbed \"Click Frenzy\". Many websites immediately crashed, went offline, or had major server issues, including the Click Frenzy promotion website. David Jones, a major retailer, ran a competing sale dubbed 'Christmas Frenzy' on the same date.\n\nOnline retailer Belly Beyond held the first Cyber Monday Sale in New Zealand on November 29, 2010. The sale lasted for five days, from Monday to Friday.\n\n"}

{"id": "11283085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11283085", "title": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution", "text": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution\n\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution is an action role-playing video game developed by Eidos Montréal and published worldwide by Square Enix in August 2011 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360: a version for OS X released the following year. It is the third game in the \"Deus Ex\" series, and a prequel to the original \"Deus Ex\". The gameplay—combining first-person shooter, stealth and role-playing elements—features exploration and combat in environments connected to multiple city-based hubs, in addition to quests that grant experience and allow customization of the main character's abilities with items called Praxis Kits. Conversations between characters feature a variety of responses, with options in conversations and at crucial story points affecting how some events play out.\n\nSet in the year 2027, \"Human Revolution\" focuses on ex-SWAT officer Adam Jensen, who is employed as security officer for Sarif Industries, a company on the leading edge of advanced and controversial artificial organs dubbed \"augmentations\". An attack on Sarif Industries that apparently kills researcher and Adam's ex-girlfriend Megan Reed also leaves Adam critically injured. To save him, company CEO David Sarif subjects him to an extensive augmentation procedure: six months later, now recovered and possessing advanced augmentations, Adam sets out to pursue his attackers and the shadowy organization behind them. The story explores themes of transhumanism, the growing power of megacorporations, and their impact on social class. It also uses the series' recurring cyberpunk setting and conspiracy theory motif.\n\nDevelopment of \"Human Revolution\" began in 2007 with a small team within the fledgling Eidos Montréal studio, after multiple aborted attempts to create a sequel at original developer Ion Storm following the 2003 release of \"\". The two key influences were the myth of Icarus, a thematic element carried over from \"Deus Ex\"; and the artwork and ideas of the Renaissance, which influenced the story, graphics and music while combining with the series' typical cyberpunk elements. The open-ended nature of the gameplay was tricky for the team to achieve; as a result, the boss battles were outsourced to another developer due to time constraints. The music, composed by Michael McCann, focused on ambiance and three-layered compositions over character themes and overt melodies.\n\n\"Human Revolution\" was first announced in 2007, soon after beginning development. Its official title and release window were announced in 2010. After release, a downloadable episode titled \"\" was developed, featuring improvements on the original gameplay. A director's cut, featuring further improvements and post-release and promotional content, was released in 2013 for the original platforms and Wii U. \"Human Revolution\" received critical acclaim, with praise going to its player-driven plot, general gameplay, and freedom of choice in both story and character customization. The major criticisms went to its boss fights and recurring technical problems. The director's cut received additional praise for its revamped gameplay elements. \"Human Revolution\" spawned a spin-off titled \"\", and the direct sequel \"\".\n\n\"Deus Ex: Human Revolution\" is an action role-playing game with incorporated first-person shooter and stealth mechanics. Players take the role of Adam Jensen, a man equipped with mechanical cybernetic implants called augmentations. The game's environments, ranging from open world hubs to more scripted environments, are explored in first-person, although actions such as hiding behind cover, conversing with non-playable characters (NPCs), and some attack animations switch to a third-person view. In these environments, players can find NPCs that will advance both the main story quest and optional side quests: completing quests, along with other actions such as combat with enemies, rewards Adam with experience points, which raise his experience level. Also accessible are black market vendors which supply equipment and weapons for Credits, the in-game currency. Interactive objects within environments can be highlighted, although these options are either turned off on the hardest difficulty or can be turned off in the options menu by the player.\n\nThere are a variety of ways to approach the game's situations: players can use a violent approach and shoot their way through environments while using cover to hide from enemy fire. Alternately, Adam can take a stealthy approach, avoiding guards and security devices, again using cover to avoid enemy sight lines. Adam can move between cover elements and around corners while staying hidden. The melee takedown system offers lethal and non-lethal options, in addition to an assortment of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Adam can also move the bodies of enemies into hiding places, preventing them from being seen and raising an alarm. A key part of Adam's abilities are augmentations, which can be acquired and upgraded using Praxis Kits either bought from special vendors, found in the game environments, or are automatically unlocked by leveling up: higher-level augmentations require more Praxis Kits to unlock. Augmentation functions can range from passive enhancements to Adam's vision or damage resistance, to active upgrades such as allowing Adam to fall from great heights without being injured or increase his strength. Some augmentations are dependent on Adam's energy level, deactivating after an amount of energy has been drained.\n\nAt multiple points within the game, Adam partakes in conversations with NPCs related to main and side quests. When talking, Adam is presented with three different conversation options that affect the outcome of conversations: choosing the right option can help with completing objectives while choosing the wrong option closes off that route and forces the player to find an alternate solution. A \"Social\" augmentation enables better reading of an NPC's expression and judging their psychological profile, improving chances of selecting the right dialogue option. While in the game's environments, Adam finds terminals and computers that can be accessed either with a password or through hacking. When hacking, the hacking screen is summoned, which shows the pathway through a device's security system to access the information: the pathway is accessed by opening \"directory\" nodes to reach the registry. Different nodes have different ratings, affecting how easily they can be accessed. Various devices have different grades of difficulty, which in turn dictate how many times hacking may be attempted. Each hacking attempt activates a Diagnostic Sub-Routine which works to stop the hack, activating a time limit once it is alerted. Adam can use additional skills and items to lengthen the time, such as software to stop or instantly capture nodes or fortify captured nodes to increase the time limit. Successful hacks yield experience points, Credits, and sometimes additional items.\n\n\"Human Revolution\" takes place in the year 2027, 25 years prior to the original \"Deus Ex\". The \"Deus Ex\" series is set in a cyberpunk future rife with secret organizations and conspiracies: among these forces is the Illuminati. Leading up to \"Human Revolution\", there have been marked improvements in human society, with people actively combating global warming, finding cures for a large variety of diseases, and improving green energy. Alongside this, global megacorporations have come to eclipse government authority in power and influence, while private military forces dwarf the sanctioned armies of First World countries. Advances in biotechnology and cybernetics have led to the development of \"augmentations\", advanced artificial organs capable of greatly improving and enhancing the human body's performance. The development of augmentation technology has triggered the creation of a new social divide: those with augmentations become the world's new upper class citizenry and are touted as the future of humanity, while normal humans form the majority of the lower-class population. Augmentations also come with the necessity of taking Neuropozyne, a limited and expensive immunosuppressive drug that stops the body rejecting the technology. By the events of \"Human Revolution\", society is being divided between \"augs\", humans who have accepted augmentation technology; and normal humans who are either morally opposed to it, too poor to afford it, or whose bodies actively reject it. The tensions between the two factions begin generating open conflict.\n\nThe main protagonist is Adam Jensen: coming from a humble background in Detroit, he worked as a leader with the local SWAT squad until he refuses to follow a questionable order and is turfed out. After this, he is taken on as a security manager at Sarif Industries, a local company at the leading edge of augmentation technology. A fellow at the company is Megan Reed, a researcher for Sarif and Adam's ex-girlfriend. His employer is company CEO David Sarif, who is instrumental in saving Adam after he was left near-dead at the beginning of the game. Adam meets many key characters during his missions between Detroit, Montreal and the new Shanghai metropolis of Hengsha. These include Sarif's chief pilot Faridah Malik; Sarif systems engineer Frank Pritchard; Eliza Cassan, a media personality and public face of Picus Communications; William Taggart, founder of the anti-augmentation group Humanity Front; Hugh Darrow, who founded augmentation technology but is one of those genetically incapable of using them; Zhao Yun Ru, CEO of the Tai Yong Medical megacorporation; and the \"Tyrants\" mercenary squad, composed of leader Jaron Namir and his associates Lawrence Barrett and Yelena Fedorova.\n\n\"Note: While the general plot of Human Revolution follows a distinct path, many elements are subject to the player's decisions. The game also offers several subplots which the player may or may not encounter, depending on their actions within the game. This synopsis concentrates on the main, unavoidable plot thread of the game.\"\n\nOn the eve of unveiling a new type of augmentation that will end dependence on Neuropozyne, Sarif Industries is attacked by a group of heavily augmented terrorists known as the Tyrants, who slaughter the staff. Megan Reed and a number of other scientists are presumed dead in the attack. Adam Jensen is grievously wounded in the attack. David Sarif saves Jensen's life by giving him advanced augmentations that turn him in a half-machine super-soldier. Curiously, Jensen's body does not attempt to reject the implants, and therefore he does not need to take Neuropozyne.\n\nMonths later, Adam is summoned to deal with another terrorist attack on Sarif Industries, this time by a group of anti-augmentation radicals. Curiously, one of the terrorists is augmented, and Jensen finds him trying to steal weapon blueprints from a computer. The augmented terrorist shoots himself in the head before Jensen can capture him. Frank Pritchard later discovers that the augmented terrorist was being controlled remotely by some unknown hacker. Pritchard tracks the hacking signal to an abandoned factory in Highland Park. Adam discovers the Tyrants guarding a FEMA detention camp, but they are moving out after the failure of the Sarif raid. Adam confronts and defeats one of the mercenaries, Barrett, who tells him to go to the newly built Hengsha megacity in China before killing himself with a grenade.\n\nTogether with pilot Faridah Malik, Adam travels to Hengsha and tracks down the hacker, Arie van Bruggen, who is being both hunted by private security company Belltower Associates and hidden by local triad leader Tong Si Hung. Van Bruggen directs Adam to find evidence inside Tai Yong Medical, the world's largest augmentation technology manufacturer and Sarif's main rival. Infiltrating Tai Yong, Adam finds footage of a call between Namir and Zhao Yun Ru, which confirms that Megan and the other missing scientists are alive and that Eliza Cassan is somehow involved. Confronting Zhao in her penthouse apartment, he learns that she is allied to a powerful organization that controls global interests before she triggers security and forces him to leave. Traveling to the Picus corporate building in Montreal, Jensen tracks down Eliza, revealed to be an artificial intelligence construct designed to influence the media. Despite her programming, she has begun to question her role and offers to help Adam. After he defeats Tyrant member Fedorova, Eliza gives him footage directing him to Doctor Isaias Sandoval, aide to William Taggart.\n\nBack in Detroit, Sarif admits to Adam that the Illuminati are behind the attacks. Adam infiltrates a Humanity Front rally and discovers Sandoval's location. Sandoval admits his involvement in the kidnapping and gives Adam the lead to find the researchers. Back in Sarif HQ, Adam meets Hugh Darrow, who is currently working to stave off global warming with the newly constructed Panchaea Facility in the Arctic. Adam, along with other augmented people, also start experiencing painful glitches, with authorities urging them to have a biochip replacement. Pritchard locates the tracking beacon of one of the scientists, taking Adam back to Hengsha, where he and Malik are ambushed by Belltower. The beacon leads Adam to Tong Si Hung, who has just been implanted with the now-deceased scientist's arm. Under Tong's direction, Adam manages to stow away in a stasis pod in the wake of a staged explosion, waking up a few days later in a secret Singapore base. He finds the kidnapped scientists, and learns that the biochip malfunctions were staged to distribute the result of their research: a new biochip to control augmented humans. Adam and the scientists stage a distraction, allowing him to infiltrate the facility's secret bunker. Here he faces Namir one last time, then finds Megan. Confronted, Megan tells him that she was kidnapped for her research into augmentation rejection. She confesses that her cure for augmentation rejection was based on Jensen's DNA.\n\nMoments later, Darrow appears live on television and broadcasts a modified signal that throws any augmented person with the new biochip into a fear-driven, murderous frenzy. Jensen evacuates the scientists, and commandeers an orbital flight module to reach Panchaea. He confronts Darrow, who reveals that he wants humanity to abandon the augmentation technology he invented, because he believes it will destroy human identity. Adam sets out to disable Panchaea's Hyron Project supercomputer and end the broadcast; on the way, he encounters Taggart and Sarif, who each urge him to side with them and further their own agendas. At the heart of Panchaea, Jensen first confronts Zhao Yun Ru when she tries to hijack the signal for her own use; then Eliza, who offers Jensen four choices. Jensen can either broadcast the full truth and distance humanity from augmentations; rig the broadcast so it throws suspicion on the Humanity Front and allows further development of augmentation technology; send out a report blaming the incident on contaminated Neuropozyne so Taggart's group and by extension the Illuminati find new support; or destroy Panchea, leaving no-one to \"spin the story\". Depending on the choice and whether Jensen has taken a pacifist or violent approach through the game, his final narration varies.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Megan meets with Bob Page, the main antagonist of \"Deus Ex\", to discuss her employment in \"the nanite virus chimera\" and \"D project\": prior to this, Page instructs his cohort Morgan Everett to search the Hyron Project for salvageable technology for the 'Morpheus Initiative': these are the precursors to the creation of the Denton clones, the manufactured nanotechnological \"Gray Death\" virus and the \"Helios\" artificial intelligence, key parts of the plot of \"Deus Ex\".\n\nThe original \"Deus Ex\" and its sequel \"\" were developed by Ion Storm, with varying involvement of series creator and studio co-founder Warren Spector and designer Harvey Smith. After the release of \"Invisible War\", multiple attempts were made to develop a sequel, even after Spector left Ion Storm. The two main projects were dubbed \"Deus Ex: Insurrection\", which used the same engine as \"Invisible War\" while moving away from its divisive mechanics; and \"Deus Ex 3\", which aimed to be an open world game with a branching narrative. An aborted attempt, intended as the fourth \"Deus Ex\" project following \"Insurrection\", led to the development of \"Project Snowblind\". Prospective development on the third \"Deus Ex\" game was halted when, following further staff departure and financial difficulties, the studio's owner Eidos Interactive closed them down in 2005.\n\nConcept development on \"Human Revolution\" began in early 2007, shortly after the founding of Eidos Montréal. The team at this point was fairly small, consisting of producer David Anfossi, director Jean-François Dugas, senior designer François Lapikas, and art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête. The early period was devoted to research before performing brainstorming sessions to create the game's basic concepts. One of the concepts established early on was that it would be an ambitious project and they needed to bring the key staff on board as early as possible. They started with playing the first two games, determining what they liked and disliked about the original \"Deus Ex\", and how they could carry over or improve these points. An early decision was to remain true to the series' core values, despite \"Human Revolution\" being essentially a series reboot. When presenting their project to Eidos management, they presented multiple sheets of their concept, and after two days the game was green-lit. The entire main staff were newcomers to the \"Deus Ex\" series, providing a large challenge to the development team as a whole. During the early design process, one of the things that worked well was the blueprint testing process and cutting items that would either not fit into the game or would make the project too large to handle. The most difficult period for the development team was the opening two-year period, which was described as a \"vertical slice\" through the game concepts, when they were trying to bring a piece of \"Human Revolution\" to retail quality before extending that out across the whole game.\n\n\"Human Revolution\" was planned for consoles and Microsoft Windows systems, and one of the things Dugas insisted upon was that the PC version would not be a port of the console versions. With this in mind, the two versions needed to be as close as possible in gameplay feel. The full motion cutscenes were created collaboratively by Eidos Montréal, Square Enix's CGI department Visual Works, and Vancouver-based company Goldtooth Creative. Goldtooth created initial concepts based on the game, then the animation proper was handled by Visual Works. Visual Works were involved with the project since 2009, following the acquisition of Eidos by Square Enix. It was later stated that, despite knowing the necessity of incorporating multiple story-telling methods into the game, the team felt that the cutscene creation process was turned into a multi-studio effort due to time constraints. Time limits also forced them to drop real-time cutscenes. For the engine, the team used the Crystal Engine, developed by Crystal Dynamics for use in their . This was part of a technology sharing policy that would further improve the engine for distribution in an enhanced form. Despite the initial intentions and an early tech demo going smoothly, the engine quickly proved to be inadequate to the team's needs as Eidos Montréal and Crystal Dynamics were pulling the engine's design in different directions. Eidos Montréal were given permission to branch away from the core engine so they could make the game work, adding new production tools that made it work in the new environment.\n\nLapikas was responsible for multiple aspects of the game as lead designer, including the cover system, augmentations, conversations, hacking, combat and stealth AI, interactive objects, and general balancing. When creating the gameplay, the team settled on four pillar concepts: \"Combat\", \"Stealth\", \"Hacking\", and \"Social\". While gameplay took place primarily in first-person, a feature that had been part of the \"Deus Ex\" series since its inception, during certain actions the camera switched to a third-person view. This was because the team wanted to create a connection between players and Adam despite the risk that it might break immersion. Augmentations were designed to be customizable by players depending on playstyle, but unlike the previous two \"Deus Ex\" games, the use of mechanical augmentations and switches to third-person view enabled the player to see their changes affect Adam's appearance.\n\nFor combat, multiple references were used. These included \"\" for the cover system and tactical combat; \"F.E.A.R.\" for the design of AI; \"BioShock\" for the interlinking of weapon and obstacle types; the \"Call of Duty\" series for the regenerating health system; and \"Resident Evil 4\" for multiple aspects including the inventory system, game economy and contextual actions. Regenerating health ended up being divisive among the fanbase during the game's run-up to release, despite it being seen as a necessary inclusion in the modern gaming market. Combat was intended to be easy-to-understand and visceral, with enemy types ranging from normal humans to augmented humans to robots, all mixed and matched for different combat situations. For stealth gameplay, the team used \"Metal Gear Solid\" as reference for the AI and alert systems, and \"\" for the general organic feel of stealth. They had similar precepts to combat, wanting to make this style's rules and rewards clear to players. Interactive hacking was one of the earliest things the team had decided upon, alongside not including quick time events. The Hacking mechanics were inspired by the tabletop role-playing game \"Shadowrun\". They were designed to invoke tension, and require a survey of both the surroundings and the security system while at the same time providing rewards. Social interactions followed similar patterns, becoming an extension to the general gameplay, with a similar risk-reward system.\n\nThe team had originally wanted to create the game's boss battles in-house around the game's similar elements of player choice, with their initial design inspired by the boss fights in \"Metal Gear Solid\". As the development on the story and gameplay framework took priority, boss battles became less and less of a focus. It eventually reached a point when the main development team could not complete them in time for the game's release. The team contemplated cutting them, but that would have negatively impacted the story and other areas of the game's design. In the end, development of the boss battles was outsourced to Grip Entertainment. Having been given access to the game's engine, Grip Entertainment were given the task of creating the boss battles and incorporating them into the framework of \"Human Revolution\". For this, they needed to incorporate their own technology into the system, working from Eidos' specifications while bringing their own development style to bear on the project. They also attempted to balance the boss fights' action-focused approach with the other elements within \"Human Revolution\" so it would be accessible to all players.\n\nThe script of \"Human Revolution\" was written by Mary DeMarle, who was narrative director and main writer. While she did act as chief writer, DeMarle also worked on a number of other people throughout development so the story could be conveyed through environments and dialogue, along with handling how its progression was influenced by player choices. Sheldon Pacotti, main writer for the first two \"Deus Ex\" titles, was brought in as story consultant during the early stages, and was also contacted regularly through production to ensure that the storyline fitted properly within the series chronology. A total of four writers worked on the game, including author James Swallow. DeMarle was brought onto the project four months into its development, after it had been decided that it would be prequel to the first game, focusing on mechanical rather than nanotechnological enhancement technology. As part of her research, DeMarle looked up multiple subjects, from speculated conspiracy theories to the current level of biotechnology: the final story was influenced in large part by her reading of non-fiction and writings concerning transhumanism. DeMarle compared the game's study of transhumanism through main character Adam to that in the 1982 film \"Blade Runner\", while also using the video game medium to put questions surrounding the ethics and motivations surrounding transhumanism in a nuanced way. She also stated that Adam being forced to confront these issues in person was the narrative's central irony, something that had previously been explored using different narrative elements in \"Deus Ex\". The ending, which was ultimately decided using a choice of buttons, was chosen because of technical and time constraints while retaining player interaction. While the gameplay evolved continually through development and some elements required cutting, the story remained almost unchanged, instead being further refined and improved to work out plot holes.\n\nWhen creating the character of Adam Jensen, DeMarle wanted to give him a well-defined personality, and this necessitated balancing it with the narrative's player-driven nature. One of the biggest challenges was creating the various dialogue choices, as she needed to imagine what a character would say if they were hostile when she might normally portray them as benign. Multiple layers of dialogue were created within these variances to create different atmospheres within the narrative. There was standard dialogue with minor characters, more complex dialogue with major characters in quests, and what DeMarle termed \"conversation boss fights\", dialogue tied to the gameplay where social skill could help the player reach an objective. When creating characters, the team drew inspiration from the character portrayals in the \"Metal Gear\" series. When designing the corporate side, DeMarle particularly cited the backgrounds of Howard Hughes, Richard Branson and Bill Gates as inspiration for the powerful CEO figures in the narrative of \"Human Revolution\". She also noted the way in which corporations had gained greater power than governments in the narrative, something that paralleled political comments on corporate power at the time.\n\nThe world of \"Human Revolution\" was designed to parallel the Greek myth of Icarus; in the myth, Icarus was flying with artificial wings, but flew too close to the sun and destroyed his wings, causing his fatal fall. The world's new reliance on and experimentation with augmentation technology mirrored the myth, with the game's narrative taking place at a crucial tipping point, the outcome of which would be decided by the player. The general focus on technology and its effect on human society also tied into the game's visual themes. The development team used multiple sources as references while creating the world and scenario. \"The Children of Men\" was used to capture the setting and resultant chaotic drama, \"Bioshock\" gave them a reference for the handling of mature themes, while the television series \"Rome\" showed how powerful people's ambitions shaped history. The sense of tension between augmented and normal humans was inspired by the similar tension between humans and mutants in the \"X-Men\" franchise. For the conspiracy elements of the plot, the team used novels \"Deception Point\", \"The Firm\", and Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" saga as inspiration. The desired quality of cutscenes and dialogue were directly inspired by the \"Grand Theft Auto\" and \"Mass Effect\" franchises. DeMarle termed the final product as a study in contrasts, as the implementation of augmentation technology had created a new form of divided social class system when other social barriers had fallen. Other themes used earlier in \"Deus Ex\", such as exploring a culture of fear; the workings of a surveillance state; and the exploitation created by economic inequality, were paralleled in \"Human Revolution\". To add more depth to the world and narrative, the team created supplementary written material such as emails, e-books, and cell phone-like devices called pocket secretaries.\n\nJonathan Jacques-Belletête acted as the game's art director, being in charge of creating its look. The two key visual themes were the Icarus myth and the artwork of the Renaissance: both were woven in on a narrative and visual level. In terms of colors, the team drew inspiration from notable Renaissance artists, including Johannes Vermeer and Rembrandt. The color scheme was dominated by black and gold: black represented the game's dystopian aspects, while the gold both humanity and hope for the future. The Renaissance styling originally permeated everything, but they were ending up with crates looking like baroque furniture, so they toned it down and blended it with modern and cyberpunk elements. During development, the team coined the term \"cyber-renaissance\" to define their blending of Renaissance styling, cyberpunk elements, and the Icarus myth. An extensive amount of concept art was created for the game: while the majority was handled by artists Richard Dumont and Eric Gagnon, other contributors included Jim Murray, Brian Dugan, Theirry Doizon, Trong Nguyen and Sébastien Larroudé.\n\nWhile cyberpunk remained a core part of the game, the team were faced with the trouble that no-one really knew what cyberpunk was any more: the most recent game and film references they had were from the early 2000s, as many works that might have been classed as cyberpunk were now being treated as science fiction. While they could easily have replicated the atmosphere of films like \"Blade Runner\", the team wanted to create something original within the genre. Something that concerned the team was about portraying the world of \"Human Revolution\" in relation to the original \"Deus Ex\", which chronologically took place 25 years later: while the original \"Deus Ex\" used technological elements common at the time it was made such as 4:3 aspect ratio monitors and landline telephones, \"Human Revolution\" used mobiles and wide-screen televisions. According to Jacques-Belletête, this separation was ultimately put down to the differing portrayals of the world between the two games: while \"Deus Ex\" was set in poor communities and focused on the social impact of new technology, \"Human Revolution\" focused on the high end of society and technology's physical impact.\n\nJacques-Belletête worked on character designs with Murray, whose previous work included artwork for the comic series \"2000 AD\". Before designing character costumes, Jacques-Belletête looked extensively at modern fashion. As focusing purely on Renaissance styling would have resulted in clothing styles deemed \"too allegoric\" to work in the game, they redesigned them so they included Renaissance and cyberpunk elements while resembling clothing people would wear in the present day and not appearing cliched. For Adam's character design, the team looked at multiple protagonist from cyberpunk fiction, from \"Blade Runner\" to the original \"Deus Ex\". Their main wishes were to incorporate sunglasses and a trench coat. Jacques-Belletête moderated his design to combine Renaissance aesthetics with the cyberpunk thematics: he defined it as being able to see Adam's augmented state in combat during the brief third-person camera moments while still seeing him having a meal in a high-class restaurant. One design which had him sleeveless throughout the game was scrapped as it made him \"look like a douche\". Instead, they created two looks: a sleeveless action-oriented look for missions, and a sleeved trench coat with a high collar and geometric patterning to portray the Renaissance elements. In total, it took two years and a half to finalize Adam's design, with multiple designs being rejected as they failed to properly balance the cyberpunk and Renaissance elements.\n\nThe team wanted to make the game as consistently realistic as possible, wishing to avoid the situation of realistic character models standing in front of low-resolution backgrounds. They created varying degrees of technical advancement for different locations: the most realistic location they created was the Detroit hub, while the most advanced was the two-level fictional metropolis of Hengsha. Architecture in the Detroit area was inspired by then-modern buildings from Japan and Europe. Jacques-Belletête spent a long time researching furniture designs while creating interiors for in-game environments, joking that they could fill an IKEA catalogue with the results. Multiple other hub locations were planned, including the upper levels of Hengsha, and an area of Montreal dubbed \"Plateau\" that featured \"very specific architecture, called tri-plexes, with twirling exterior staircases made of [...] old metal\". At the beginning of production, there were even plans to feature a hub location in India. When it became clear how much work it would be, the team cut out what could not be managed. Upper Hengsha was built but never finished before being scrapped.\n\nThe music of \"Human Revolution\" was composed by Michael McCann, who worked on the score from 2008 to 2011. McCann also handled production, performance, mixing and arranging. Additional arrangements were done by Francois Arbour and Eric Arvisais. Vocals were provided by Andrea Revel and Courtney Wing. McCann, when comparing \"Human Revolution\" with his prior work on Ubisoft's \"\", stated that the latter could be scored more like a feature film due to its linear nature, while \"Human Revolution\"s non-linear approach to both gameplay and story made composition more challenging. McCann's music for \"Human Revolution\" was focused around the game's multilayered dualistic themes, which he described as \"technology/nature, past/future, wealth/poverty\", all of which were encompassed by the general transhumanist theme. McCann and sound director Steve Szczepkowski initially started out using dark electronic scoring typical of the cyberpunk genre, but during the three-year period he worked on the game the music gradually became more \"organic\". He was influenced by the visuals' Renaissance styling, convincing him to blend organic and traditional cyberpunk elements. The electronic elements were influenced by the film music of John Carpenter, Vangelis, and the band Tangerine Dream. The acoustic mood elements were inspired by the work of Lisa Gerrard, Ennio Morricone and Elliot Goldenthal. Outside films, he was strongly influenced by electronic bands and musicians, such as Amon Tobin and the band Massive Attack.\n\nThe musical structure was defined by him as \"three-sided\", mimicking the thematic use of triangles in the game. His three musical elements were acoustics (vocals, strings) representing the past; electronic music representing the future; and the present being a mixture of the two in both style and instrumentation. Vocals also evoked slight religious overtones, which again connected to the use of the number three due to the number's multiple religious associations, in turn suggested and influenced by the Renaissance atmosphere. Another example of three-fold design was the ambient music, which needed to vary between quiet, tense and active depending on Adam's situation: each piece was constructed as a standalone cue that would interact with its fellows depending on the flow of gameplay. This presented a challenge to McCann about the handling of themes and melodies, as short cues might grow repetitive over time. Individual environments were also designed to contrast each other musically. An example given by McCann was different areas of the main city hubs: in the wealthy areas of Hengsha, the music evokes light and wealth, while in the poor areas of Detroit, it would be dark to reflect lawlessness and the surrounding decay. This necessity of intertwining music with the environment meant that McCann needed to keep the music minimal enough to be unobtrusive while still being noticeable.\n\nMcCann did not design any specific character themes, instead keeping any recurring themes ambiguous. He gave both stylistic and technical reasons for this: technically the music system was too simple to allow for a large number of unique musical cues, and stylistically it worked on a technical and musical level for there to be no specific musical themes influencing the player's judgement of characters and situations. The cues for hacking sequences were created fairly early in the process, and was one of a group of cues McCann created during a break from the project. A piece he commented on in 2010 was \"Icarus\", the game's main theme. He created special versions for the game's reveal trailer, including a six-minute version broken into five sections for the director's cut of the trailer. He worked on creating the theme for two months, starting out with piano, vocals and minimal synthesizer work before building the full layers onto it. The final layer added were \"synth arpeggios\" that completed the piece's transformation into a full piece of cyberpunk-themed music. The \"Icarus\" theme, and by extension the soundtrack, also tied into the game's overall themes and motifs.\n\nA soundtrack disc was included in the limited \"Augmented Edition\". An official album, \"Deus Ex: Human Revolution Original Soundtrack\", was released on November 15, 2011. It was released through Sumthing Else Music Works as a physical and digital release. The album contained 25 tracks created from 50 out of the 200 pieces created for the game. The tracks included both cues from the game and arranged versions used in trailers. McCann chose the tracks to represent the game's story, drawing on the various styles of the music as a whole. He used the official album release to accentuate what he had been doing for the soundtrack as a whole. He initially wanted the soundtrack to be two discs, but realized that this would lead to repetition, so limited himself to a single disc. The remaining unreleased pieces were left out because of that potential repetition. The soundtrack received praise from multiple music critics: Original Sound Version's Gideon Dabi, commenting on the game's music prior to the album's commercial release, was highly positive about McCann's work, calling it \"a tremendous upgrade over its predecessors\" and praising its low-key impact. Simon Elchlepp, writing for Video Game Music Online, gave the album 4/5 stars: he called it \"a very satisfying experience\", praising the score's connection to the game's themes and overall quality despite some perceived missteps about use of its main theme. RPGFan's Liz Maas said that, while it trended towards being generic, with the track \" Barrett Boss Fight\" being most guilty of this, it managed to remain consistent with its themes and was worth buying.\n\nA third entry in the \"Deus Ex\" series was stated to be in development at Eidos Montréal in May 2007 by Eidos France director Patrick Melchior during an interview on MusiquePlus. At the time, Eidos did not comment on the story. Eidos Montréal project manager Stéphane D'Astous confirmed the game's existence in November, stating that concept approval had only just been granted. An initial teaser trailer was released on November 26, 2007. The game's official title, first details, and original release window were announced at the 2010 Game Developers Conference. It was published worldwide by Square Enix. While originally scheduled for 2010, the game was shifted to beyond April the following year so the team could further polish the gameplay. It was released for PlayStation 3 (PS3), Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC). The gameplay was identical across all platforms barring control schemes. Originally Eidos had intended to make the PC retail version of the game region locked. The reason behind this was due to DVD limitations which meant the languages on the game had to be split. However, due to negative reaction from the public, this lock was not implemented.\n\nThe PC port was outsourced by Eidos Montréal to Nixxes Software, who also worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of \"Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light\". The decision to outsource the PC port was made because the team wanted to make a quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 renderer that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement of the PC port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as \"Bioshock\" and \"Max Payne\" to the platform.\n\nIt released in August 2011 in major Western regions: it released in North America on August 23, Australia on August 25, and Europe on August 26. In addition to the standalone releases, special editions were created featuring extra content in North America and Europe. The \"Explosive Mission Pack\" included a mission focusing on a central character from \"Deus Ex\" along with additional weapons and equipment. The \"Augmented Edition\" included all content from the \"Explosive Mission Pack\" in addition to new equipment and in-game bonuses. The European version sported a few extra items than the North American version. A separate pack included codes to unlock \"Deus Ex\"-themed items for \"Team Fortress 2\" for pre-orders on Steam. The OS X port released on April 26, 2012. The version released was the \"Ultimate Edition\", including all pre-order content in addition to downloadable content (DLC) released the previous year. A minor controversy arose around the PC version when video game retailer GameStop started removing content from the original packaging. GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for free access to \"Human Revolution\" on OnLive, an online gaming service, stating that the coupon promoted a competitor of one of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had recently acquired. As an apology, GameStop began giving customers a $50 gift card in-store to those who purchased copies of \"Deus Ex: Human Revolution\" for PC prior to August 26 and who brought the issue to their staff.\n\nThe game was localized for and released in Japan for PS3 and Xbox 360, and included all pre-order content. The PS3 version also included the English voice track. The game's subtitle was cut for Japan, releasing simply as \"Deus Ex\". It was given a \"Z\" rating by country's CERO entertainment rating board, equivalent to the North American ESRB's \"Adults Only\" rating, although it still underwent editing to remove some overtly violent and suggestive content, the display of which is prohibited under Japanese law. Initially planned for release alongside Bandai Namco's \"Tales of Xillia\", it was pushed forward into the following month due to CERO requesting a further edit. It eventually released on October 20.\n\nA DLC episode set during the main game, \"\", released digitally on October 18 for Steam and Xbox Live, and October 19 for PlayStation Network (PSN). It likewise debuted in Japan for the console versions: it released on PSN on March 7, 2012, and March 20 for Xbox Live. Set during a transitional event in-game, the plot sees Adam captured and stripped of his augmentations, having to escape and navigate a cargo ship and then a base operated by Belltower.\n\nPlans for DLC were first announced in August 2010, with it being planned as an extension of the game. The developers initially did not plan for DLC, with it beginning development later in the game's production when the visual theme was finalized. Despite using only core team members, development was slow due to the main focus being on \"Human Revolution\". For \"The Missing Link\", the team improved the lighting, gameplay mechanics, player freedom, and character animation. The DLC was developed entirely at Eidos Montréal, and this gave the team the opportunity of developing a boss fight with multiple solutions, something they regretted not being able to do with the main game.\n\nA director's cut of \"Human Revolution\", titled \"Deus Ex: Human Revolution – Director's Cut\", was announced in April 2013. It was co-produced by Eidos Montréal, Australian developer Straight Right — who had previously handled the Wii U port of \"Mass Effect 3\" — and Canada-based Snowed In Studios. Originally announced as a Wii U exclusive, it was later announced that it would also release on its original platforms. One of the major changes was the boss arenas: while they could not create non-lethal options to take down bosses, the team created alternate strategies for players who took a stealthy and otherwise non-lethal path. They also made adjustments to the energy system, improved enemy AI, and upgrades to the lighting and shading systems. These changes were carried over from the development of \"The Missing Link\", which had been developed based on the team's wishes to improve on aspects of the main game. While previous ports of major games for Wii U had been underwhelming in the eyes of the gaming public, Eidos Montréal saw it as a chance to create the \"ultimate\" version of \"Human Revolution\".\n\nThe Wii U version of \"Director's Cut\" was priced higher than the other console versions: according to the staff, this was because of its added features. Console versions included a second screen option for some functions: the Wii U GamePad was used for the Wii U, PlayStation Vita for the PS3 version, Xbox SmartGlass for the Xbox 360 version. When originally developed for the Wii U, it was intended to make playing the game easier, along with evoking some of the early impressions from the initial CGI trailer from 2010. The decision to port \"Director's Cut\" to multiple platforms was based on fan feedback requesting a multiplatform release. The \"Director's Cut\" included all the additional content alongside the main game, from the added equipment to the DLC episode \"The Missing Link\", here incorporated into the main game. Also included was audio commentary from the developers activated using icons scattered through levels, and a documentary on the game's creation. For owners of the original version, a cheap upgrade option was offered, with the price varying depending on how much of the additional content owners possessed. It released for Wii U, PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 on October 22, 2013. It released on OS X, April 16, 2014. Like the main game, its port was handled by Feral Interactive.\n\nA promotional limited comic series was produced in the run up to the game's release. The comic was written by Robbie Morrison, and drawn by Sergio Sandoval and Trevor Hairsine. The cover art was handled by Murry, while both McMarle and Jacques-Belletête took supervisory roles for the story and artwork respectively. The comic was published by DC Comics between February 9 and June 20, 2011.\n\nA spin-off novel, \"Deus Ex: Icarus Effect\", was written by Swallow. It was a story set around the same time as the main game, following new characters Ben Saxon and Anna Kelso as they uncover a hidden conspiracy. First announced in July 2010, it was published by Titan Books on February 22, 2011. A second novel by Swallow, \"Deus Ex: Fallen Angel\", was released as a free online download alongside the release of the \"Director's Cut\": the novel details Malik's early life in Hengsha. A film adaptation was also announced, planned by Eidos Montréal and CBS Films: based on the story of \"Human Revolution\", Scott Derrickson was attached as director and co-writer, C. Robert Cargill as co-writer, and Roy Lee and Adrian Askarieh as producers.\n\nThe game received widespread critical acclaim upon release. Review aggregate site Metacritic gave the game scores of 90/100 for PC, and 89/100 for PS3 and Xbox 360. These were based on 52, 50 and 70 critic reviews respectively. Reception of \"Director's Cut\" was also generally positive: Metacritic gave the Wii U and PC versions scores of 88/100 and 91/100, respectively based on 30 and 4 critic reviews.\n\nTom Bramwell of Eurogamer praised the story's fit within the game mechanics, additionally praising the side quests for how they fleshed out the world and positively comparing the dialogue and character interaction to a boxing match. \"Game Informer\"s Andrew Reiner called the story and world \"riveting\" despite Jensen being a weak character. Kevin VanOrd, writing for GameSpot, positively noted the story's style and exploration of contemporary themes. Arthur Gies of IGN found the story held up throughout despite some awkward writing. \"PC Gamer\"s Tom Francis did not comment much on the story, rather noting its scale and the various environmental details that fleshed it out for players. Mike Channell of \"Official Xbox Magazine\" called the game one of the most intelligently-written games for the console, praising both the main narrative and side quests despite some supporting characters' stories being left unfinished. \"Famitsu\" noted that the game had a high amount of player choice, positively referencing the conversation choices presented to them.\n\nBramwell was positive about the overall gameplay, citing hacking as his favorite activity, although he noted that the game's limitations stood out because of the overall quality. Reiner was positive about the general experience, but found fault in the enemy AI and general balancing issues. VanOrd praised the freedom of choice and playtime, but found the weak enemy AI distracted from the overall experience. Gies likewise praised the amount of choice offered to players, finding its stealth and action gameplay equally strong. Francis positively compared the number of options open to the player to the original \"Deus Ex\" despite some linear design choices, praised the hacking for its more interactive form than earlier series titles, and generally enjoyed both the action and stealth gameplay. Channell, while noting that pre-augmentation combat was \"clumsy\", was generally positive about the way combat evolved and praised its focus on stealth and conversation mechanics. \"Famitsu\" was highly positive about the gameplay, feeling that it successfully hybridized the role-playing and first-person shooter genres, praising character customization and enemy AI. Unanimous criticism was directed at the boss battles, which multiple critics found either poorly executed or at odds with the rest of the experience.\n\nBramwell positively noted the level design while criticizing repetition within interior environments. Reiner found Jensen's voice actor inexpressive and facial animations \"robotic\", but praised the soundtrack despite its similarity to the music of \"Mass Effect\" and generally lauded the world design. VanOrd, while praising the visuals, found the facial animations dated and noted long load times as being among some of the technical problems encountered. Gies greatly praised the game's artstyle and music, while also noting technical difficulties and faulting the voice acting. Frances similarly called the mission environments \"gorgeous\". Channel praised its visuals, and called its voice acting \"impeccable\".\n\nIn his review of the \"Director's Cut\", IGN's Brian Albert, despite noting inconsistencies in enemy behavior, shared much of his praised with the original version in addition to the added gameplay mechanics and improved boss battles. GameSpot's VanOrd again noted dated facial animations and poor AI, but generally praised other aspects of the \"Director's Cut\", particularly pointing out the improvements to boss battles. Bramwell, again writing for Eurogamer, particularly praised the revamped boss battles and the inclusion of additional content such as \"The Missing Link\" that did not function properly as a standalone release. He also echoed much of his praise for the original game. Michael Gapper of \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" stated that all the changes made to the game for the \"Director's Cut\" had improved it for the better, praising its gameplay balance and freedom of choice in addition to the new features.\nUpon its release in North America, despite coming in during the later half of the month, \"Human Revolution\" became the top-selling video game title in August. It remained in the top ten best-selling titles in September, dropping to sixth place. In the United Kingdom, the game likewise debuted in first place in the all-format game software charts, not including digital sales: the majority of sales were on Xbox 360, with a 57% ratio. 31% was sold on PS3, while 13% of sales were for PCs. Its total sales in its first week were nearly one million units, described as \" just 26,000 units away from \"Invisible War\"s lifetime sales\". It was later classed as the second best-selling game of the month behind \"Zumba Fitness\". In the following weeks, it continued to rank high in the top ten best-selling games for the region: it remained the top seller in the second week despite a 47% sales drop, while by late September it had dropped to fifth place. It was the UK's 21st best-selling video game title of 2011. Total sales of \"Human Revolution\", as reported in November 2011, reached 2.18 million copies in North America and Europe: 800,000 were sold in North America, while Europe showed stronger sales of 1.38 million. The positive sales of \"Human Revolution\" contributed to publisher Square Enix posting triple its predicted profits for the April–September period, with the publisher calling the sales a \"favorable result\".\n\nFollowing the release of \"Human Revolution\", a mobile spin-off titled \"\" was developed by N-Fusion Interactive. \"The Fall\" is a sequel to \"Icarus Effect\", following the later adventures of protagonists Saxon and Keslo. It released in July 2013 for iOS, and 2014 for Android and PC. A new entry in the series was announced as being in development in 2013, alongside the release date for the \"Director's Cut\". The game, \"\", is a direct sequel to \"Human Revolution\", taking place two years after the ending where Adam destroyed Panchea, in a world that has rejected augmentation technology and segregated those who possess it. It was released in August 2016. \"Mankind Divided\" forms part of a series-wide project dubbed the \"\"Deus Ex\" Universe\", with both games and additional media designed to expand upon the series setting.\n"}

It was originally manufactured from polystyrene parts by E.S.R., Inc. starting in 1963 and sold as an educational toy for US$4.99.\n\nIn essence, the Digi-Comp I contained three mechanical flip-flops, providing an ability to connect them together in a programmable way using thin vertical wires that are either pushed, or blocked from moving, by a number of cylindrical pegs. The whole arrangement was 'clocked' by moving a lever back and forth. Different configurations of these cylinders caused the Digi-Comp to compute different boolean logic operations. With a three binary digit (3-bit) readout of the state of the flip-flops, it could be programmed to demonstrate binary logic, to perform various operations such as addition and subtraction, and to play some simple logic games such as Nim.\n\nThe Digi-Comp I version 2.0 was made available by Minds-On Toys in 2005 as a relatively inexpensive binder's board version of the original Digi-Comp with a much enhanced instruction manual.\n\nA successor, the Digi-Comp II, was not programmable, but in effect a visible calculator.

{"id": "11373742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11373742", "title": "Engleby", "text": "Engleby\n\nEngleby is a novel by the author Sebastian Faulks. It tells the tale of a working-class boy who wins a place at an esteemed university and becomes a murder mystery after the disappearance of a girl at a nearby college.\n\nMike Engleby attends an 'ancient university' studying English at first, but switches over to natural sciences after he begins to doubt the legitimacy of the subject. He is infatuated with a girl named Jennifer Arkland, whose name he only discovered on posters advertising her running for a society committee. He begins to attend the society in order to meet her and attends her history lectures, in a different faculty, despite not studying it.\n\nHe does not perform as well as expected on his second year exams but takes part in the production of a student film in Ireland involving Jennifer. While there he reads Jennifer's letters and begins to reflect about his past.\n\nHe remembers his time at the grammar school he attended, his dad's death and his subsequent scholarship to Chatfield – a public school for the children of navy servicemen.\n\nAt Chatfield he was bullied by the prefects and by other students, gaining the name \"Toilet Engleby\" by asking for permission to go to the toilet rather than \"lavatory\" during a lesson. One prefect, Baynes, steals a cake sent to him by his mother and later forces Engleby to take a bath in cold water. He begins to steal, at first to pay for letters to his sister, but he soon escalates to frequent theft and begins to buy cigarettes to sell on to other pupils.\n\nEngleby assaults Baynes who suffers from head injuries and broken leg in the attack which is staged to look line an accident. Mike meets a boy named Stevens to whom he takes an immediate dislike. He is outgoing, enthusiastic, plays rugby and is liked by his year. His final memory of Chatfield is of forcing Stevens to take a cold bath, just as Baynes had done to him previously.\n\nJennifer Arkland disappears half-way through her final year after a party attended by Mike, who at some point stole Jennifer's diary, which he begins to read and memorise its contents. Mike is questioned by the police about the disappearance of Jennifer and claims Jennifer to be his girlfriend. As other students have also been interviewed, some statements have been made by other students that Mike is homosexual, which doesn't tally up for the investigating officers. His alibi fails to stand up but no concrete evidence against him is found and the investigation is suspended.\n\nMike fails to attain a first in his final exams. He moves to London and makes a living by drug dealing, eventually becoming a journalist. He assumes the name Michele Watt as the left-wing paper he writes for is seeking to have more female writers. After a while he changes his assumed name to Michael Watson, as he claims he no longer needs to pretend to be a woman and it was convenient for him to keep a similar name.\n\nHe reveals that during his time at university he began to have panic attacks and that he has been taking 'blue pills' on the advice of a doctor at a mental health hospital he was taken to, after collapsing during a panic attack.\n\nHe meets and starts a relationship with a woman working at the same paper, Margaret, whom he then moves in with.\n\nYears later, Jennifer's body is unearthed and Mike is called in for questioning. It is revealed that a shirt the officers took from his college rooms during the investigation was checked using newly developed DNA techniques and was shown to have Jennifer's blood on it.\n\nMike pleads guilty to the murder of Jennifer Arkland. He explains that he murdered Jennifer as she came home from a party, offering her a ride and refusing to let her get out. He drove to a remote location and, when she offered to do anything to be let go, he killed her. He adds that he also may have murdered a German woman called Gudrun Abendroth in London and had attacked Baynes while at Chatfield, causing injuries, then thought to be accidental, which contributed to Baynes' premature death some time later.\n\nHe pleads limited responsibility and after analysis by psychiatrist Dr. Exley he is diagnosed with a personality disorder and is sent to a mental institution. He is never released but eventually attains a sense of peace, teaching many of the other patients various basic skills.\n\nThe narration is from the perspective of Engleby himself, and he often obscures or misrepresents the events around him. This is most noticeable in the disappearance of Jennifer, to which he gives no indication of his involvement until very near the end of the novel. \n\nEngleby suffers from numerous panic attacks throughout the course of the novel and takes medication to prevent symptoms of anxiety. He occasionally alludes to feeling isolated, but rejects the idea that he suffers from depression. Late in the novel, a psychological professional diagnoses him with schizoid personality disorder and some narcissistic tendencies, while maintaining that he does not suffer any biological mental illness like schizophrenia.\n\nEngleby idolizes Jennifer throughout the novel. He stalks her by following her into lectures and attending her societies. He is frustrated when she pleads to leave the car when he presumes to give her a lift home and deliberately takes a wrong turn to prolong their time together. He later kills her, apparently for accidentally threatening his sexual potency after he drives her off into a secluded area. He appears to consider women fundamentally different from men, and dismisses demands for sexual equality as 'flak from grumpy feminists', calling ideas of female equality 'lies'.\n\nReviews of the novel were mixed, with many critics citing the almost unlikable narrator as a negative factor.\n\nPhil Hogan of \"The Observer\" said, \"The character of Engleby's oddness, though, is harder to fathom. His prose has that flat, stilted quality familiar to the modern reader as a sign of moral vacuity, but does he have to be so uninteresting with it?\" He went on to say, \"The eventual arrival of men in white coats – a welcome introduction of sane voices – heralds the most successful section of the book. Relieved of the burden of faux suspense, ideas kept at the fringe by passing ephemera are foregrounded, themes blossom. This, you sense, is what Faulks has been waiting for – the chance to engage more directly with his subject. His prose, freed from the shackles of a troubled mind, starts to shine too. The trouble is it shines too late.\"\n\nJane Shilling of \"The Telegraph\" said, \"Like \"Human Traces\", \"Engleby\" is distinguished by a remarkable intellectual energy: a narrative verve, technical mastery of the possibilities of the novel form and vivid sense of the tragic contingency of human life.\"\n\nTerrence Rafferty of \"The New York Times\" said, \"At one point, near the end, when both the character and his creator seem to be getting slightly desperate, Engleby throws out the possibility that the 'idea of self' may be no more than a 'necessary fiction.' Maybe it is. 'Engleby' isn't.\"\n\n"}

Until the late 20th Century, the only legal option was the lottery. The government opened three major lotteries available to the public. A late 1940’s travelogue notes that merchants kept bowls of dice at their stalls to engage in gambles with their customers when “housewives would routinely bet on the days their horoscope was fortunate\" which means that on slightly more than fifty percent of such occasions they return home empty-handed and with the housekeeping money gone.\" \" There is no estimate on the black market gambling sector, but it is estimated to be worth billions of dollars. \n\nIn an effort the combat illegal gambling, the government has slowly begun to make gambling legal, while cracking down on major illegal gambling rings. In March 2018, the government shut down a $420 million gambling ring that implicated two senior government officials and some 90 other people (including junior government officials) in the sting. In September 2018, leader of an illegal online sports betting ring was sentenced to nine years in jail; the operation was worth some US$26 million. A separate online gambling ring shut down in last 2017 was thought to be worth US$89 million. Xinhua also reported a rash of pawn shops popping up during the 2018 World Cup, whose only purpose was to serve local gamblers. \n\nThe country opened the doors for locals to play games of chance on an experimental basis starting in 2017. The country has eight casinos open for foreign passport holders, with investors seeking to open up the larger domestic customer base, in an attempt to stimulate economic growth. As part of a three year experiment, locals are permitted to enter casinos if they can show monthly income exceeding 10 million dong (US$449) and have to pay 1 million dong entry tax. The country has also recently announced plans (as of 2017) to legalize sports betting, as part of a strategy to increase foreign investment and tax revenues \n\nOn June 14, 2018, the National Assembly passed a bill legalizing sports betting, with government oversight. This follows a 2017 decree which legalized betting on international football games, horse races, and greyhound races. All players must be at least 21 years of age, with the minimum bet set at 1000 dong and a maximum of one million dong per day. Players wishing to enter a casino must also be at least 21 years old, have the permission from their family to do so and not have a criminal record. \n\nThe largest hotel-casino in Vietnam (as of 2017) is the Grand- Ho Tram, controlled by Philip Falcone, opened in 2013. The US$1 billion building has a 550 room hotel, a Greg Norman designed golf course and second hotel tower under construction as of 2017. \nIn order to operate a casino, foreign investors are required to invest over $2 billion in order to qualify for casino licenses. In 2018, construction has begun along a three-kilometer (2-mile) stretch of coastline in central Vietnam where the country’s biggest casino is set to open. Suncity Group Holdings Ltd of Macau has invested $4 billion in the Hoiana project, that covers almost 1,000 hectares and includes shops, restaurants, golf courses and water parks. The casino will be owned by SunCity, keeping a one-third stake in the project. VinaCapital, a Vietnamese investment management and real estate firm, and the Hong Kong-based VMS Investment Group will also hold similar ownership stakes in the project. \n\nAnother casino opened in 2013 is the Ho Tram, which is a multi-billion dollar facility, located a two-hour drive from Ho Chi Minh City. \n\nTwo other casinos are under construction in 2018, one in Van Don in the northern province of Quang Ninh, and one on Phu Quoc island. These are part of the pilot project to allow locals to enter casinos. The Van Don is scheduled to open in 2019 and will also be run with management service agreement given to SunCity. \n"}
{"id": "20179720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20179720", "title": "Ghost World (film)", "text": "Ghost World (film)\n\nGhost World is a 2001 black comedy film directed by Terry Zwigoff and starring Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi. Based on the comic book of the same name by Daniel Clowes, with a screenplay co-written by Clowes and Zwigoff, the story focuses on the lives of Enid (Birch) and Rebecca (Johansson), two teenage outsiders in an unnamed American city. They face a rift in their relationship as Enid takes interest in an older man named Seymour (Buscemi), and becomes determined to help his romantic life.\n\nThe film debuted at the Seattle International Film Festival in 2001. It had little box office impact, but was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and has become a cult film.\n\nBest friends Enid and Rebecca face the summer after their high school graduation, with no plans for their future other than to find jobs and live together. The girls are cynical social outcasts, but Rebecca is more popular with boys than Enid. Enid's diploma is withheld on the condition that she attend a remedial art class. Even though she is a talented artist, her art teacher, Roberta, believes that art must be socially meaningful and dismisses Enid's sketches as nothing more than \"light entertainment\".\n\nThe girls see a personal ad in which a lonely, middle-aged man named Seymour asks a woman he met recently to contact him. Enid makes a prank phone call to Seymour, pretending to be the woman and inviting him to meet her at a diner. The two girls and their friend, Josh, secretly watch Seymour at the diner and make fun of him. Enid soon begins to feel sympathy for Seymour, and they follow him to his apartment building. Later they find him selling vintage records in a garage sale. Enid buys an old blues album from him, and they become friends. She decides to try to find women for him to date.\n\nEnid has meanwhile been attending her remedial art class, and she persuades Seymour to lend her an old poster depicting a grotesquely caricatured black man, which was once used as a promotional tool by Coon Chicken Inn, the fried chicken franchise now known as Cook's Chicken, where Seymour works as a manager. Enid presents the poster in class as a social comment about racism, and Roberta is so impressed with the concept that she offers Enid a scholarship to an art college.\n\nSeymour receives a phone call from Dana, the intended recipient of his personal ad. Enid encourages him to pursue a relationship with Dana, but she becomes unexpectedly jealous when he does so.\n\nEnid and Rebecca's lives start to diverge. While Enid has been spending time with Seymour, Rebecca has found a job at a coffee shop, has made new friends and has become more interested in clothing and boys. Enid also finds a job so she can afford to rent an apartment with Rebecca, but her attitude gets her fired after only one day. The girls argue, and Rebecca abandons the idea of living with Enid.\n\nAt the end of the summer, Enid and Seymour's lives fall apart. When Enid's poster is displayed in an art show, school officials find it so offensive they force Roberta to give her a failing grade and revoke the scholarship. Enid turns to Seymour for solace, resulting in a drunken one-night stand. Seymour breaks up with Dana, and is called to account at work when the Coon Chicken poster is publicized in a local newspaper. He unsuccessfully tries to contact Enid, only for Rebecca to tell him about Enid's prank phone call, describing the way they mocked him at the diner. Seymour is upset and ends up in a violent confrontation with Josh, resulting in his being injured and hospitalized. Enid visits him in an effort to apologize, causing him to realize that he has no chance of any kind of future with her.\n\nAfter everything that has occurred, Rebecca and Enid have ceased to be friends, and Enid gives in to her childhood fantasy of running away from home and disappearing. She has seen an old man, Norman, continually waiting at an out-of-service bus stop for a bus that will never come. Finally, as Enid watches from across the street, Norman boards an out-of-service bus. The next day, while Seymour discusses the summer's events with his therapist, Enid returns to the bus stop and boards the out-of-service bus when it arrives.\n\nThe film was directed by Terry Zwigoff with cinematography by Affonso Beato. Zwigoff and \"Ghost World\" comic creator Daniel Clowes wrote the screenplay together. Years later, Clowes admitted that learning how to write the screenplay came with a significant learning curve. He recalled, \"I started by trying to transcribe the comic into Final Draft. I figured that’s how you do an adaptation. Then I tried throwing everything away and writing an entirely new story that was very different from the book. And I synthesized those two things into a final screenplay. The actual film itself is very different from the script we wrote. We ended up jettisoning the last twenty pages and rethought the whole thing as we were filming. It was really held together by hair and spit.\"\n\nZwigoff and Clowes presented Beato with the task of making a comic book look to the movie. They asked for a fresh technique: earlier examples of the form such as \"X-Men\" and \"Dick Tracy\" were dismissed as literal-minded and \"insulting\" to the art form. According to Clowes, cameraman Beato \"really took it to heart,\" carefully studying the style and color of the original comics. The final cut is just slightly oversaturated, purposefully redolent of \"the way the modern world looks where everything is trying to get your attention at once.\"\n\nZwigoff also added his individual vision to the adaptation, particularly in his capture and editing of languid, lingering shots, a technique derived from his experience as a documentarian. Another notable touch is his minimal use of extras in the film, making the city and its streets intentionally empty – Clowes notes approvingly, \"It captures this weird feeling of alienation in the endless modern consumer culture.\"\n\nMusic in the film includes \"Jaan Pehechan Ho\" by Mohammed Rafi, a dance number choreographed by Herman Benjamin from the 1965 Bollywood musical \"Gumnaam\" which Enid watches and dances to early in the film, and \"Devil Got My Woman\" by Skip James (1931), as well as \"Pickin' Cotton Blues\" by the bar band, Blueshammer.\n\nThere are songs by other artists mentioned in the film, including Lionel Belasco, which are reflective of the character Seymour, and of director Terry Zwigoff. Zwigoff is a collector of 78 RPM records, as portrayed by Seymour. Other tracks are by Vince Giordano, a musician who specializes in meticulous recreations of songs from old 78 RPM records.\n\nReferenced in the film is R. Crumb & His Cheap Suit Serenaders, a band that Zwigoff played in. Enid asks Seymour about the band's second album, \"Chasin' Rainbows\", and Seymour replies, \"Nah, that one's not so great.\"\n\nMissing from the soundtrack is \"What Do I Get?\" by Buzzcocks, which can be heard when Enid dresses up like a punk, and the song \"A Smile and a Ribbon\" by Patience and Prudence.\n\n\"Ghost World\" premiered on June 16, 2001 at the Seattle International Film Festival, to lower than average recognition by audiences, but admiration from critics. It was also screened at several film festivals worldwide including the Fantasia Festival in Montreal.\n\nFollowing the film's theatrical exhibition in the United States, \"Ghost World\" was released on VHS and DVD format via MGM Home Entertainment in early 2002. Additional features include deleted and alternative scenes, \"Making of Ghost World\" featurette, Gumnaam music video \"Jaan Pehechaan Ho\", and the original theatrical trailer.\n\nA Special Edition of the film received an official Blu-ray release on May 30, 2017 from The Criterion Collection, with a 4K transfer, interviews with the performers, and audio commentary.\n\nWith a limited commercial theatrical run in the United States, \"Ghost World\"'s commercial success was minimal. The film was released on July 20, 2001 in five theaters grossing $98,791 on its opening weekend; it slowly expanded to more theaters, reaching a maximum of 128 by the end of the year. It went on to make $6.2 million in North America and $2.5 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $8.7 million, just above its $7 million budget.\n\n\"Ghost World\" received a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With acerbic wit, Terry Zwigoff fashions Daniel Clowes' graphic novel into an intelligent, comedic trip through deadpan teen angst.\" The film also holds a score of 88 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 31 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, \"I wanted to hug this movie. It takes such a risky journey and never steps wrong. It creates specific, original, believable, lovable characters, and meanders with them through their inconsolable days, never losing its sense of humor.\" In his review for \"The New York Times\", A. O. Scott praised Thora Birch's performance as Enid: \"Thora Birch, whose performance as Lester Burnham's alienated daughter was the best thing about \"American Beauty\", plays a similar character here, with even more intelligence and restraint.\" In his \"Chicago Reader\" review, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, \"Birch makes the character an uncanny encapsulation of adolescent agonies without ever romanticizing or sentimentalizing her attitudes, and Clowes and Zwigoff never allow us to patronize her.\" However, Andrew Sarris of \"The New York Observer\" disliked the character of Enid: \"I found Enid smug, complacent, cruel, deceitful, thoughtless, malicious and disloyal...Enid's favorite targets are people who are older, poorer or dumber than she is.\" Kevin Thomas, in his review for the \"Los Angeles Times\", praised Steve Buscemi's portrayal of Seymour saying, \"Buscemi rarely has had so full and challenging a role, that of a mature, reflective man, unhandsome yet not unattractive, thanks to a witty sensitivity and clear intelligence.\" \"Time\" magazine's Andrew D. Arnold wrote, \"Unlike those shrill, hard-sell teen comedies on the other screens, \"Ghost World\" never becomes the kind of empty, defensive snark-fest that it targets. Clowes and Zwigoff keep the organic pace of the original, and its empathic exploration of painfully changing relationships.\"\n\nMichael Dean of \"The Comics Journal\" addressed the concerns of comics fans head-on: \"Those with higher expectations – and, certainly, \"Ghost World\" purists – are likely to experience at least a degree of disappointment. Some of the comic's air of aimless mystery has been paved over with the semblance of a Hollywood plot, and to that extent, the movie is a lesser work than the comic. But it's still a far better movie than we had a right to expect.\" According to Dean: \"The injection of a relatively trite plot situation into \"Ghost World\"s more enigmatic stream of events is perhaps forgivable, since the film might otherwise never have been produced. Its greatest sin, the misappropriation of Enid's longing, is not so forgivable, though the overlap between Zwigoff's distaste for modernity and Enid's distrust of social acceptability makes it almost palatable. In any case, we want to forgive it, because so much is right about the movie.\"\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film an \"A-\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \"\"Ghost World\" is a movie for anyone who ever felt imprisoned by life, but crazy about it anyway.\" In her review for the \"LA Weekly\", Manohla Dargis wrote, \"If Zwigoff doesn't always make his movie move (he's overly faithful to the concept of the cartoon panel), he has a gift for connecting us to people who aren't obviously likable, then making us see the urgency of that connection.\" In \"Sight & Sound\", Leslie Felperin wrote, \"Cannily, the main performers deliver most of their lines in slack monotones, all the better to set off the script's wit and balance the glistering cluster of varyingly deranged lesser characters.\" In his review for \"The Guardian\", Peter Bradshaw wrote, \"It is an engaging account of the raw pain of adolescence: the fear of being trapped in a grown-up future and choosing the wrong grown-up identity, and of course the pain of love, which we all learn to anaesthetise with jobs and mundane worries.\" Several critics referred to the film as an art film.\n\n\"Ghost World\" topped MSN Movies' list of the \"Top 10 Comic Book Movies\", it was ranked number 3 out of 94 in Rotten Tomatoes' \"Comix Worst to Best\" countdown (where #1 was the best and #94 the worst), ranked 5th \"Best\" on IGN's \"Best & Worst Comic-Book Movies\", and \"Empire\" magazine ranked the film 19th in their \"The 20 Greatest Comic Book Movies\" list. It is considered a cult film. It was added to the Criterion Collection in 2017.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13696846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13696846", "title": "Larry Flynt Publications", "text": "Larry Flynt Publications\n\nLarry Flynt Publications, or LFP, Inc., runs the adult entertainment empire founded by Larry Flynt. Founded in 1976, two years after Flynt began publishing \"Hustler\" magazine, LFP was originally to serve as the parent company of this magazine.\n\nIn March 1972, Flynt created the \"Hustler Newsletter,\" a four-page, black-and-white publication of information about his clubs. This item became so popular with his customers that by May 1972 he expanded the Hustler Newsletter to 16 pages and in August 1973, to 32 pages. As a result of the 1973 oil crisis the United States entered an economic recession; Hustler Club customers tightened their spending and Flynt had to find financing to pay his debts or go bankrupt. He decided to turn the \"Hustler Newsletter\" into a national sexually explicit magazine. He paid the start-up costs of the new magazine using sales taxes collected in the clubs. In July 1974, the first issue of \"Hustler\" was published. Although the first few issues went largely unnoticed, within a year it became highly lucrative and he was able to pay his tax debts. The magazine struggled for the first year, partly because many distributors and wholesalers refused to handle it as its nude photos became increasingly graphic. It targeted working-class men and grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around 3 million (current circulation is below 500,000). In November 1974, Hustler showed the first \"pink-shots,\" or photos of open vaginas. Flynt had to fight to publish each issue as many people, including his distribution company, found the magazine too sexually explicit and threatened to have it removed from the market. Shortly thereafter, Flynt was approached by a paparazzo who had taken nude pictures of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis while she was sunbathing on vacation in 1971. He purchased them for $18,000 and published them in the August 1975 issue. That issue attracted widespread attention, and one million copies were sold within a few days. Now a millionaire, he bought a $375,000 (1976 dollars) mansion.\n\nAfter 1976, Larry Flynt Publications expanded to include many pornographic magazines as well as mainstream titles under its umbrella. Other pornographic magazines included:\n\nIn 1988, Gail Harris, founder and CEO of Falcon Foto created, developed and produced from conception the first niche magazine, Barely Legal, for Larry Flynt Publications; it became one of Flynt's best-selling titles, second only to Hustler Magazine.\n\nThe launch of Barely Legal revolutionized the porn industry with 22 copycat titles appearing, as well as format changes in established publications and in the video medium.\n\nBarely Legal is published 13 times per year by Larry Flynt's Larry Flynt Publications, and is sometimes marketed as Hustler Barely Legal. Hustler Video also produces a Barely Legal line of videos. Less frequently, LFP publishes Barely Legal Hardcore magazine, which depicts young women engaging in hardcore sex.\n\nWhen the market for men's magazines softened in the late 1990s, LFP expanded into production of adult videos through its Hustler Video subsidiary, and moved further into the mainstream publishing market. To accommodate this expansion, the company moved its headquarters to Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California, where it remains to this day. It launched a series of special-interest magazines, such as \"Camera & Darkroom Photography\", \"PC Laptop Computers\" and \"Maternity Fashion & Beauty\". \n\n\"RIP Magazine\" was a music magazine covering heavy metal. It was the first non-pornographic publication produced by LFP, and was edited by Lonn Friend, who had previously edited \"Hustler\" and \"Chic\". Writers included rock journalist, Judy Wieder, Mick Wall, and Andy Secher.\n\nIt published 14 bi-monthly issues of \"TurboPlay Magazine\" (June/July 1990 – August/September 1992) dedicated to covering TurboGrafx-16 and TG-CD hardware and software. It was a spin-off publication of \"Video Games & Computer Entertainment\" (\"VG&CE\"), a popular multi-platform gaming magazine of the late 1980s / early 1990s. Every issue of TurboPlay was 32 pages in length and a yearly subscription cost $9.95. L.F.P. published three bi-monthly issues of \"DUOWORLD\" magazine (July/August 1993 – November/December 1993) before it was canceled. \"DuoWorld\" was very similar in format to \"TurboPlay\", but with a focus on the newly released TurboDuo console (i.e. \"TurboMail\" and \"TurboNews\" became \"DuoMail\" and \"DuoNews\", respectively). \n\n\"Tips & Tricks\" (later \"Tips & Tricks Codebook\") is a video game magazine published by LFP. For most of its existence, the publication was devoted almost exclusively to strategies and codes for popular video games. It began as a spin-off from \"VideoGames\" magazine, which in itself morphed out of \"VideoGames & Computer Entertainment.\" \"VG&CE\" and \"VideoGames,\" like \"Tips & Tricks\", were published by LFP following the purchase of \"A.N.A.L.O.G.\", \"ST-LOG\" and other computer magazines from publishers Michael DesChenes & Lee Pappas in the late 1980s.\nAs the 21st century approached, magazine sales further declined. Together, the company's 31 periodicals had a monthly circulation of between 2.5 and 3 million. This was a far cry from the 1970s, when Hustler alone sold that many copies each month. Because of this LFP focused on turning its magazine and video titles such as \"Hustler\", \"Barely Legal\", \"Busty Beauties\", \"Beaver Hunt\", and \"Asian Fever\" into profitable websites.\n\nBy 1998, estimates LFP was doing $135 million in annual sales with 51,112 periodicals published and 7,812 movies and or video tapes produced.\n\nHustler Video is a pornographic film studio owned by LFP. In 2003 Hustler Video bought VCA Pictures, which maintains a separate brand identity within the LFP conglomerate. Hustler Video has produced several top-selling and award-winning films, such as \"Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle\", \"\" and \"Who's Nailin' Paylin?\".\n\nIn 2010 when AIDS Healthcare Foundation lodged a complaint against the Hustler Video group for not requiring the actors to wear condoms and thereby contributing to the spread of HIV, Michael H. Klein, the President of LFP responded by saying the company would not back down from shooting raw sex videos.\n\nThe Hustler Club is a chain of strip clubs. In 1968, Flynt opened the first Hustler Club which featured semi-clothed girls. One Hustler Club in Dayton quickly lead to a chain of clubs with the same name in Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Toledo, and Akron. By early 1970, he had eight clubs and 300 employees. In 1974 with profits from \"Hustler\" magazine far surpassing those of the Hustler Clubs, Flynt decided to get out of the bars business and be a publisher full-time. For close to 30 years the Hustler Club name lay dormant. In the early 2000s (decade), LFP began to license the Hustler Club name for new clubs across the country. Currently there are Hustler Clubs in 6 U.S. states and 3 countries.\n\n"}
{"id": "10713759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10713759", "title": "Lauren Cooper", "text": "Lauren Cooper\n\nDame Lauren Alesha Masheka Tanesha Porticia Fenston Estonia Monaveen Vervain Felicia Jane Cooper is a fictional character in \"The Catherine Tate Show\". Lauren is one of the show's main characters and is played by Catherine Tate. The character is \"killed off\" in the 2007 Christmas Special which aired on 25 December.\n\nLauren is a 15-year-old schoolgirl with a surly attitude and was most widely known for her phrase \"Am I bovvered?\" (i.e. bothered - the \"v\" in the word takes the place of the \"th\" that should be there; see th-fronting). When feeling angry or embarrassed, she frequently replies with defensive responses such as \"Am I bovvered?\", \"Do I look bovvered?\" or \"Are you disrespecting me?\", among others. As demonstrated through her clothing and mannerisms, Tate portrays Lauren as a caricature of a Chav. \n\nShe claimed to have been made a Dame at the end of her sketch on the Royal Variety Performance 2005.\n\nIn series one, sketches feature Lauren arguing with authority figures such as train conductors and teachers, as well as her best friend Liese Jackson (played by Niky Wardley) and love interest Ryan Perkins (played by Mathew Horne). She normally utters her trademark catchphrases only after being provoked or embarrassed. Lauren is one of the most popular characters with fans, and is arguably the most recognizable from the show. She is listed as \"Fly Girl\" on the series one DVD.\n\nIn series two, Lauren becomes more offensive than ever before. One notable change is that Lauren starts being insulting without provocation, while in the past, her catchphrase of \"Am I bovvered?\" was only used after she believed that she had been wronged in some way. She is now aged 15 and, according to one of her teachers, in grave danger of leaving school with no GCSEs.\n\nIn the 2005 Christmas special, her singing is revealed as poor when she, Liese and Ryan as \"the Flygirl Collective and MC Perkins\" audition for \"Fame Academy\". In their audition, they sing their own rendition of \"Shut Up\" by The Black Eyed Peas which is poorly received by Richard Park.\n\nIn series three, she spends the summer holidays working at \"Billy's Burger Bar\". Her attitude at school remains the same as before. She has a new rival for Ryan's affections (played by Natalie Cassidy), and falls for a fake marriage proposal from Ryan. She is due to marry Ryan in the final episode, but he jilts her at the altar because of his embarrassment of Lauren after she sings a very squeaky, off-key version of Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\" to him.\n\nDespite Lauren's blatant disregard for authority, and chav-like demeanor, she sometimes shows surprising intelligence. She is well-versed in the Periodic table, she apparently knows Shakespeare, knows how to say \"Am I bovvered?? in British Sign Language, and she even speaks French, once surprising her French teacher by asking her \"Regardez mon visage. Suis-je bovvered? Est-ce que vous appelez ma mère une ? Est-ce que vous appelez mon père un gypo?\" (\"Look at my face. Am I bovvered? Are you calling my mum a pikey? Are you calling my dad a gypo?\"), although she refuses to speak any French for her oral exam.\n\nLauren made an appearance during the BBC's Comic Relief telethon in March 2005. The sketch features fans of McFly asking the group questions. Lauren decides to ask them: \"Why are you so rubbish?\" When told by Simon Amstell, who is hosting the segment, that only positive questions are allowed, Lauren uses a variety of her catch phrases, including \"Am I bovvered?\" (\"I ain't McBovvered\") and continues to question them in a harsh manner. Lauren is then \"ordered\" to put a more positive question to the group, and confuses them with Busted, asking \"Are you gutted that Charlie left?\" She is told to leave the set, and as she does so, she asks Danny Jones from McFly to sign her knee, but walks away promptly saying \"You can't even spell.\"\n\nIn November 2005, Lauren appeared in a sketch for the Children in Need telethon. The sketch is a crossover with \"EastEnders\". The scene is set when Lauren arrives in Walford in search of revenge on Stacey Slater, who has apparently stolen her boyfriend. She looks for her in the launderette, where she finds Little Mo Mitchell, who tells her that Stacey is not there. She then makes an appearance in the Queen Vic, and Peggy Mitchell finds herself getting increasingly frustrated and annoyed with Lauren, who asks, \"Are you a Cockney? Are you a Cockney sparrow?\" (pronounced \"cockerney\"). Peggy then orders Lauren out of her pub with immediate effect.\n\nIn November 2005, Lauren was a featured sketch at the 77th Royal Variety Performance. After Lauren embarrasses herself in front of the audience, Ryan points out that the Queen is laughing at her. Looking up at the Royal Box, she asks \"Are you disrespecting me?\" and mimicks the Queen's accent, asking, \"Is one bovvered?\". She receives a phone call, answers timidly \"Hello, yes, thank you.\" and hangs up. When asked who it was, she announces \"I've just been made a dame.\"\n\nOn 16 March 2007, Tate appeared twice on Comic Relief as Lauren. Guests in the sketches included David Tennant. Tennant plays her new English teacher, Mr. Logan, who after being goaded by Lauren for his Scottish accent and resemblance to The Doctor, is finally pushed over the edge when she asks him if he fancies Billie Piper. He threatens to fail her, and Lauren proceeds to do her 'Am I bovvered?' routine in Shakespearean style 'Amest I bovvered, forsooth?' with many other famous lines changed \"looketh at my face\" followed by a recitation of Sonnet 130 off the top of her head ending with a definitive \"Bite me alien boy\". Mr. Logan then reveals he actually \"is\" the Doctor, as he produces the sonic screwdriver from inside his jacket and turns her into a 5\" Rose Tyler action figure with it, quoting \"Romeo and Juliet\" by saying \"\". The figure proclaims that it \"still ain't bovvered\". Tony Blair also makes a cameo appearance, when Lauren is on work experience at Downing Street. Upon Lauren attempting to tell Blair who the most famous person she had met was, he asks her if he is \"bovvered\", much to the astonishment of Lauren. He then instructs her to \"look at his face\" and acknowledge that \"no part of it is bovvered\". He then orders her out of his office, prompting Lauren to shout back that the most famous person she has met is Ross Kemp.\n\nIn the 2007 Christmas special of \"The Catherine Tate Show\", Lauren dies after falling from a waterfall while kayaking, having ignored warnings from a local man, after asking him \"Are you a yokel?\" and \"Were you married to your sister? But is your cousin your mum? Is your dad your brother? Are you your own father?\" At the end of the episode, Liese and Ryan are seen standing beside her gravestone that says:\n\nIn 2006, Lauren's catchphrase word \"bovvered\" was named Word of the Year. A spokesperson for the OED commented: \n\"'Am I bovvered?' and its follow-up, 'Does my face look bovvered?' had already come to be seen as the perfect expression of a generation of teenagers and their speaking style.\" \n\nAlan Carr spoofed Lauren in a sketch on Catherine Tate's episode of \"The Friday Night Project\".\n\nIn a recurring spoof on NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Fallon performs in character as a vampire version of Robert Pattinson talking about things that bother him whilst in a tree.\n\nA 2016 update to the Oxford English Dictionary added the word \"bovver\", which had been current since 1871, and had been \"made famous by comedian Catherine Tate \".\n\n"}

Graduating from a La Plata secondary school, he continued to pursue his calling in La Plata's growing independent theatre scene.\n\nEnrolling at the University of Buenos Aires School of Architecture and Urbanism in 1961, he made time for performances throughout his studies. Following his 1964 graduation, he enrolled at the prestigious University Theatre Institute of Chile (ITUCH) and returned to Buenos Aires in 1968. He was cast by Argentine playwright Roberto Cossa in a short film adaptation of his \"Los taitas\" (\"The Uncles\") and the following year, co-founded the Experimental Theatre Team of Buenos Aires (ETEBA) with Augusto Fernándes. ETEBA produced an adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's \"Peer Gynt\", \"La leyenda de Pedro\", which was well received and earned Cruz international esteem following its tour through festivals at Nancy, Berlin and Florence. ETEBA was invited to perform their \"El sapo y la serpiente\" (\"The Toad and the Serpent\") at the Munich Olympics in 1972.\n\nCruz was Professor of Acting at the National Drama Conservatory between 1972 and 1975, where he directed Peter Handke's \"The Ward Wants to be Warden\" among other avant-garde works. This experience earned him a U.S. Department of State scholarship to attend Lee Strasberg's prestigious Actors Studio in New York and a fellowship with the Gulbenkian Foundation of Portugal to attend the University of Porto's Drama School. Returning to Buenos Aires, he continued to direct his experimental theatre school, which became one of Argentina's most coveted drama schools. His production of Eduardo Pavlovsky's politically charged \"El Señor Galíndez\" led to the bombing of the Payró Theatre by the fascist commando group, the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance.\n\nHaving been given a number of supporting film roles since his appearance in \"Los taitas,\" Cruz was cast as the happy-go-lucky ghost of an assassinated stockyards worker in Fernando Solanas' \"Sur\" (1987), a chronicle of the lives of a working-class southside borough in Buenos Aires during Argentina's brutal last dictatorship. He devoted himself to his drama school, however, accepting only brief supporting roles in film until, in 1996, he was cast in Mario Levin's \"Sotto voce\" (\"Whispers\") as Walensky, a gruff southside bar owner embroiled in intrigue.\n\nLito Cruz increased his prominence as an advocate for theatre in Argentina during the 1990s, which had been the victim of intimidation during the 1970s and financial woes, since. He was named director of the Argentine Actors' Association and \"Action for Culture, Theatre and Visual Arts,\" a leading advocacy group for its field in Argentina. This work led to his appointment as National Theatres Director in 1995, a position he leveraged to help have Congress pass the \"National Theatre Law\" in 1998. The bill helped protect struggling stages against demolition and guaranteed annual subsidies for the art.\n\nLito Cruz continued his work as head of the drama school that now bears his name, while having accepted more starring roles in film. Some of the most notable have been that of a retired military officer guarding a family secret in Fito Páez's \"Vidas privadas\" (a 2001 drama that helped secure Mexican star Gael García Bernal's prominence in cinema) and as an aging intellectual facing a crossroads in life in Mario Sábato's \"India Pravile\" (2003), among others. He continues his work as an advocate for his art in government, as well, as Director of the Province of Buenos Aires Comedy and the Coliseo Podestá Theatre in La Plata.\n\nCruz created and produced \"Sueños de milongueros\" in 2009, a musical written in homage to authors Jorge Luis Borges and Alejandro Dolina, and cartoonist/satirist Roberto Fontanarrosa.\n\n"}
{"id": "51826738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51826738", "title": "Long Gone Days", "text": "Long Gone Days\n\nLong Gone Days is an dystopian role-playing video game for Windows, OSX and Linux, being developed by BURA. The original demo was written, developed, and illustrated by Camila Gormaz. It features the first hour of the story, and was released for Windows and OSX on May 13, 2016. The game was released on March 28, 2018.\n\nIn \"Long Gone Days\", the player controls Rourke, a soldier from an underground unrecognized country named \"The Core\", after he's deployed to a mission in Kaliningrad, Russia. After discovering the truth about the operation he was part of, he decides to desert and find a way to prevent the upcoming war his homeland wants to provoke.\n\nThe demo received mostly positive reviews, praising its writing and art. Reviewers especially enjoyed the use of a Morale system to motivate other party members, and the topical issues covered by the plot.\n\n\"Long Gone Days\" takes place on the Earth during the present time, in an unofficial country named The Core, whose exact location is unknown. In this place, every individual is trained from birth for their job, so they can become experts by the time they become adults. The main character of the story, Rourke, is a military sniper who has never visited the surface. He's chosen as a last-minute replacement for an operation to aid the Polish forces in Kaliningrad, without much time to review the briefing.\n\nDuring this mission, after the player eliminates the targets they were assigned to shoot, Rourke finds out all of them were civilians, and he's told by the squad's combat medic, Adair, that it is in fact a false flag operation. Rourke is shocked by the revelation, and by the fact nobody in his squad seems to mind the war crimes they are committing, and without much thought, he finally takes the decision to desert. Intrigued by the outcome, Adair makes up his mind to follow Rourke along.\n\nTaking advantage of his specialty, Adair reports a false illness that requires transferring Rourke to the nearest field hospital, using this as an excuse to escape. Even though they are walking in the opposite direction of their two bases in Kaliningrad, their plan is quickly discovered as they get seen by drones and fellow soldiers from a nearby base they weren't told about, thus realizing the operation is much bigger than they were informed of.\n\nThe demo ends with Rourke and Adair being chased by their own allies, as they have become deserters and enemies of The Core, while they try to process what are they going to do with their lives from now on.\n\n\"Long Gone Days\" is a role-playing game with visual novel elements that uses a top-down perspective. It features a traditional turn-based RPG combat, which allows the player to select which body-part of the enemy to aim. Since the story doesn't have fantasy or supernatural elements, instead of magic, the characters rely on morale. This stat can be raised or lowered by the choices the player may choose during dialogues in and outside battles, and it affects how each party member will perform in battle. If their Morale reaches zero, the character loses their will to fight.\n\nBesides the turn-based combats, the game also features a first-person sniper mode, which consists of seek and find mechanics.\n\nSince the story is set in the real world, the NPCs will speak in their native language depending on the country the characters are in. The player can recruit interpreters in order to buy at shops and complete quests.\n\n\"Long Gone Days\" was originally conceived in 2003 by Gormaz as an RPG Maker 2000 project, but it wasn't until 2015 that the development of the demo began. The game was announced for the first time on the RPG Maker forums and TIG Source on January 17, 2016. On May 13, the Windows version of the demo was released, and an OSX port was released on July 14.\n\nOn July 11, 2016, Gormaz launched a crowdfunding campaign on the website Indiegogo. The campaign reached its goal on August 11, 2016, ending with US$21,300 raised by 567 people. According to the developer, the game will be around 4 to 5 hours long, and it will have two different endings.\n\nThe demo of \"Long Gone Days\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, mostly appreciating the art style and the story. It received a score of 4.7/5 on Game Jolt, based on 480 ratings, and 5/5 on Itch.io.\n\nReviewers praised the game's focus on the use of interpreters, with Maddi Chilton of Kill Screen commenting \"Not only do they add realism to a game that deals with international military, but they bring into the spotlight something that people often forget: it's not only the soldiers shooting guns that are crucial to a war\".\n\n"}

{"id": "599231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=599231", "title": "Mother's boy", "text": "Mother's boy\n\nA mother's boy, also mummy's boy or mama's boy, is a man who is excessively attached to his mother at an age at which men are expected to be independent (e.g. live on their own, be economically independent, be married or about to be married). Due to cost of living of some states, this is a viable option for many single men or even newlyweds. Anecdotally, this age of independence varies throughout each stratum of every human society in the world, sometimes greatly. A mother's boy may be effete or effeminate, or might be perceived as being macho, or might have a personality disorder, such as avoidant personality disorder, or might be schizophrenic, so that the mother acts as a caregiver.\n\nIn classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the term Oedipus complex denotes a child's desire to have sexual relations with the parent of the opposite sex. Sigmund Freud believed that a child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex. If this identification fails, the boy remains a lifelong \"mama's boy.\"\n\nBeing mother-bonded is sometimes seen as a sign of weakness, and has a social stigma attached to it in many places, although in other places it may be more acceptable or perceived as normal. A mother-bonded man is seen to give control of his own life to his mother.\n\nIt is generally accepted that mothers and the social experiences they provide for their children, have a huge influence on the child’s social behaviour. American psychiatrist David M. Levy’s wrote in his seminal work on maternal behaviour:\n\n“His outlook on life, his attitude towards people, his entire psychic well-being, his very destiny is presumed to be altered by the maternal attitude […] If human behaviour is influenced so markedly by maternal attitudes, then surely the most important study of man as a social being is a study of his mother’s influence on his early life.”\n\nThe term ‘mama’s boy’ is not a clinical definition, but is understood as a particular kind of mother-son dynamic that reflects co-dependency, while also resulting in a number of social, emotional and emotional intelligence, and even physical deficiencies when seen in the most extreme cases .\n\nDespite limited academic literature on the long-term effects of maternal overprotection in creating grown ‘mama’s boys’, a man’s abnormal dependency on his mother for emotional, financial, moral, and other kinds of support are widely believed to originate in a prolonged, mutually dependent relationship with his mother in the first years of life. This relationship may be caused by a number of factors, including the mother’s personality, social and maternal anxieties, relationship or separation from the father, cultural context and expectations, lack of emotional, social, or financial independence, or prior experiences with child-raising. Often a mother’s excessive care in early infancy is triggered by a child’s unexpected illness, birth defects, or accidents, and may be prolonged treatment that does not end even when it is no longer needed .\n\nIn psychoanalysis, this mutually-dependent relationship and the deficiencies it brings between mother and son may be explained as a direct result of maternal overprotection, a specific kind of maternal relationship that develops in early infancy, often in the first year of life. Although defining ‘overprotection’ as an extreme form of behaviour can be difficult due to cultural, social, and economic backgrounds of families, in clinical settings cases are usually deemed extreme according to the norms within the mother’s cultural ingroup. In D. M. Levy’s study, children displaying “emotional disturbance” as a result of prolonged contact and infantilizing treatment by their mothers were hospitalized by the efforts of their fathers, teachers, social workers, and other figures in close proximity to their mother, pressuring her to seek extra help for her child’s resulting behaviour \n\nClinical studies have shown two main relationship dynamics that characterize overprotection:\n\n\"Submissive child – dominating mother\" \n\nThe submissive child is often socially awkward, unable to relate to other children, experiences anxiety when physically separated from his mother, lacks the ability to make strong, independent decisions because of mother’s dominance. His dependency on his mother is reinforced by her overly-dominating decisions and presence in his social life, and her desire to control his social, physical, and emotional environments as a way of ‘protecting’ him from perceived harms of the outside world.\n\n\"Aggressive child – indulgent/submissive mother\"\n\nThis kind of mother-son relationship gives near-complete dominance to the son, making his every wish the responsibility of the mother to fulfill. Often, the son of a submissive, indulgent mother who is also overprotective may experience the opposite in personality shaping, and display infantile power, showing a tendency to manipulate his situations in order to be the centre of attention; losing his temper when crossed or corrected, may be sexually or physically aggressive in later life and relationships. Levy describes this relationship as: “A process in which infantile power, unmodified, expands into a monstrous growth that tends to subjugate the parents” \n\n\"Maternal Love:\" \n\nEarly years have paramount influence on later life. This thinking conforms to the Freudian Oedipus complex, where the mother plays important role and investment in the child’s material, emotional, and physical reception and understanding of pleasure and other feelings (564), and where the son displays a behavioural disposition to compete, manipulate, and exhibit a temperament to gain his mothers attention. In several cases within Levy’s study, few of these boys displayed sexual responses to their mother (585-6)\n\n\"Maternal Attitude:\"\n\nThis viewpoint emphasizes that the style or stage of life set by the mother on the son influences and projects the child’s relationship to his mother to the rest of the world. A son who exhibits hunger for power and dominance, anger when crossed, or a desire to be at the centre of attention in social situations with other children were likely spoiled with constant attention, devotion, and obeisance by his mother (564). \n\nIn a normal mother-son relationship, four basic patterns of maternal care include: \n\n\nIn the case of maternal overprotection, the patterns are pushed to their extremes and are consistent across behavioural characteristics:\n\n\nThese characteristics often overlap, and are consistent with the presence of related dynamics like sibling rivalry, marital relations, maternal rejection, paternal roles, other behavioural problems and experiences that shape personality, such as disease, family life, and infantile experience [562]\n\nIn Italian culture in particular, the decision to stay home until marriage was more common for men who were unemployed. Traditionally, people have turned to their family in times of economic uncertainty, and historically can be seen as the only guarantee of survival in uncertain times. \n\nWith several different books, poems and a Hollywood movie titled “Mama’s boy”, it is the more popular and common form of referencing this term. \n\nBooks\n\n\"The Mama's Boy Myth: Why Keeping Our Sons Close Makes Them Stronger\" by Kate Stone Lombardi was published in 2013. In it, Lombardi argues that the stigma associated with the term is undeserved and a close relationship with his mother is beneficial for the son's development. \n\nPoetry\n\nFilm & Television\n\nA Hollywood movie titled Mama's Boy was released in \n\nA lesser known meme has been created to mock mama's boys. This meme is often used in a way that insults the subject's manhood or insinuates some sort of sexual relationship between the boy and his mother. \n\nIn Italian Culture, it is much more accepted, and oftentimes even encouraged, for a son to live at home until marriage. This is seen more with Italian men than women and accredited to the especially strong bond Italian men tend to form with their mothers. These men are referred to as \"figli per sempre,\" which translates as \"sons forever.\" This is often shown in pop culture versions of Italian families, where the mother is the strong matriarch. \n\nThe term \"mama's boy\" is often used in a degrading manner to refer to someone who is \"soft\" or lacks manliness. The relationship to the mother, as opposed to a more \"manly\" father figure, is shown as emasculating, and is often used as either a comedic device or a way to show someone as undesirable in platonic or romantic relationships. The mother is also stigmatized, considered to be coddling her soon or stunting his maturation. This is the only parent-child relationship that has been subject to this type of stigma. Father-daughter relationships are the most stark contrast: a close relationship to her father is considered vital for her self-esteem later on. \n\nHowever, the opposite school of thought has recently arisen. Popular figures like LeBron James, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have cited their close relationships with their mothers as being critical for their success. There is science to support this as well. Studies have found that son's that have a strong bond with their mothers tend to have less behavioral problems, lower rates of delinquency, better quality romantic relationships, and a higher sense or morality. \n\n"}

{"id": "1163412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1163412", "title": "Negotiation theory", "text": "Negotiation theory\n\nThe foundations of negotiation theory are decision analysis, behavioral decision making, game theory, and negotiation analysis.\nAnother classification of theories distinguishes between Structural Analysis, Strategic Analysis, Process Analysis, Integrative Analysis and behavioral analysis of negotiations.\n\nIndividuals should make separate, interactive decisions; and \"negotiation analysis\" considers how groups of reasonably bright individuals should and could make joint, collaborative decisions. These theories are interleaved and should be approached from the synthetic perspective.\n\nNegotiation is a specialized and formal version of conflict resolution most frequently employed when important issues must be agreed upon. Negotiation is necessary when one party requires the other party's agreement to achieve its aim. The aim of negotiating is to build a shared environment leading to long-term trust and often involves a third, neutral party to extract the issues from the emotions and keep the individuals concerned focused. It is a powerful method for resolving conflict and requires skill and experience. Zartman defines negotiation as \"a process of combining conflicting positions into a common position under a decision rule of unanimity, a phenomenon in which the outcome is determined by the process.\" Druckman (1986) adds that negotiations pass through stages that consist of agenda setting, a search for guiding principles, defining the issues, bargaining for favorable concession exchanges, and a search for implementing details. Transitions between stages are referred to as turning points. \n\nMost theories of negotiations share the notion of negotiations as a process, but they differ in their description of the process.\n\nStructural, strategic and procedural analysis build on rational actors, who are able to prioritize clear goals, are able to make trade-offs between conflicting values, are consistent in their behavioral pattern, and are able to take uncertainty into account.\n\nNegotiations differ from mere coercion, in that negotiating parties have the theoretic possibility to withdraw from negotiations.\nIt is easier to study bi-lateral negotiations, as opposed to multilateral negotiations.\n\nStructural Analysis is based on a distribution of empowering elements among two negotiating parties. Structural theory moves away from traditional Realist notions of power in that it does not only consider power to be a possession, manifested for example in economic or military resources, but also thinks of power as a relation.\n\nBased on the distribution of elements, in structural analysis we find either power-symmetry between equally strong parties or power-asymmetry between a stronger and a weaker party. All elements from which the respective parties can draw power constitute structure. They may be of material nature, e.g., hard power, (such as weapons) or of social nature, i.e. soft power, (such as norms, contracts or precedents).\n\nThese instrumental elements of power, are either defined as parties’ relative position (resources position) or as their relative ability to make their options prevail.\n\nStructural analysis is easy to criticize, because it predicts that the strongest will always win. This, however, does not always hold true.\n\nAccording to structural analysis, negotiations can therefore be described with matrices, such as the Prisoner's dilemma, a concept taken from game theory. Another common game is the chicken dilemma.\n\nStrategic analysis starts with the assumption that both parties have a veto. Thus, in essence, negotiating parties can cooperate (C) or defect (D). Structural analysis then evaluates possible outcomes of negotiations (C, C; C, D; D, D; D, C), by assigning values to each of the possible outcomes. \nOften, co-operation of both sides yields the best outcome. The problem is that the parties can never be sure that the other is going to cooperate, mainly because of two reasons: first, decisions are made at the same time or, second, concessions of one side might not be returned. Therefore the parties have contradicting incentives to cooperate or defect. If one party cooperates or makes a concession and the other does not, the defecting party might relatively gain more.\n\nTrust may be built only in repetitive games through the emergence of reliable patterns of behavior such as tit-for-tat.\n\nThis table illustrates the options and possible outcomes of the Negotiator's Dilemma.\n\nProcess analysis is the theory closest to haggling. Parties start from two points and converge through a series of concessions. As in strategic analysis, both sides have a veto (e.g. sell, not sell; pay, not pay). Process analysis also features structural assumptions, because one side may be weaker or stronger (e.g. more eager to sell, not willing to pay a certain price).\nProcess Analysis focuses on the study of the dynamics of processes. E.g. both Zeuthen and Cross tried to find a formula in order to predict the behavior of the other party in finding a rate of concession, in order to predict the likely outcome.\n\nThe process of negotiation therefore is considered to unfold between fixed points: starting point of discord, end point of convergence. The so-called security point, that is the result of optional withdrawal, is also taken into account.\n\nAn important feature of negotiation processes is the idea of turning points (TPs). A considerable amount of research has been devoted to analyses of TPs in single and comparative case studies as well as experiments. Considered as departures in the process, Druckman (2001, 2004) has proposed a three-part framework for analysis in which precipitating events precede (and cause) departures which have immediate and delayed consequences. Precipitating events can be external as when a mediator becomes involved, substantive as when a new idea is proposed, or procedural as when the formal plenary structure becomes divided into committees. Departures can be abrupt or relatively slow and consequences can be escalatory, moving away from agreement, or de-escalatory, moving in the direction of agreement. Using this framework in a comparative study of 34 cases, Druckman (2001) discovered that external events were needed to move talks on security or arms control toward agreement. However new ideas or changed procedures were more important for progress in trade or political negotiations. Different patterns were also found for interest-based, cognitive-based, and values-based conflicts (Druckman, 2005) and between domestic and international negotiations (Hall, 2012). \n\nTurning points are also analyzed in relation to negotiation crises or disruptions in the flow of the talks. Earlier research showed that TPs are more likely to occur in the context of crises, often in the form of changes that put the talks back on track and transition to a new stage (Druckman, 1986, 2001). A key to resolving crises is reframing the issues being discussed. The choice to reframe was shown to occur more frequently among negotiators when their trust is low and transaction costs are high (Druckman and Olekalns, 2013). The research to date on TPs has generated ideas likely to stimulate further studies. Some of these ideas include a search for the underlying mechanisms that can explain the emergence of TPs. Foremost among these are flexibility and adaptability in response to crises or violations of expected behavior. The key challenge is to discover the conditions that foster progress toward a solution to the dilemma of balancing the desire to agree with the desire to come out favorably. For a review of the research on turning points see Druckman and Olekalns (2013a).\n\nIntegrative analysis divides the process into successive stages, rather than talking about fixed points. It extends analysis to pre-negotiations stages, in which parties make first contacts. The outcome is explained as the performance of the actors at different stages.\nStages may include pre-negotiations, finding a formula of distribution, crest behavior, settlement\n\nBad faith is a concept in negotiation theory whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.\n\nBad faith in political science and political psychology refers to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of information processing. The \"inherent bad faith model\" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by Ole Holsti to explain the relationship between John Foster Dulles’ beliefs and his model of information processing. It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent. A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are John Foster Dulles’ position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel’s initial position on the Palestinian Liberation Organization.\n\n\nDruckman, D. (2001).

It is based on the novel of the same name by Alice Tisdale Hobart. A man blindly puts his faith in his employer. The film was loosely remade in 1941 as \"Law of the Tropics\".\n\nAmbitious, idealistic Stephen Chase (Pat O'Brien) goes to work for the Atlantis Oil Company and is sent to a remote outpost in rural China run by \"No. 1 Boss\" (Arthur Byron). After a while, he feels secure enough to send for his fiancée and goes to Yokohama to meet and marry her. However, when he gets there, all that is waiting for him is a telegram, in which she explains she is unwilling to live in such a backward country.\n\nHe strikes up a conversation with Hester Adams (Josephine Hutchinson). She had come to see China for the first time with her father, a professor of Oriental studies, only to have him die on the voyage. As they become better acquainted, Stephen comes up with an idea (partly to save himself from losing face). He asks Hester to marry him, explaining that it would be a partnership. She is impressed by his dream of modernizing China and accepts. It does not take long however for them to fall in love.\n\nNo matter what happens, nothing shakes Stephen's faith in the company. When his friend, No. 1 Boss, is callously transferred to a lesser position, the old man commits suicide rather than accept the insult. The new boss, J.T. McCarger (Donald Crisp), orders Stephen to man an even more isolated post near Siberia. Stephen is reluctant to go since Hester is pregnant with their first child, but has no choice. Once there, he makes the agonized decision to go deal with a dangerous oil fire rather than stay and help the doctor deliver the baby. When he returns, he learns that the child is dead. This causes a temporary rift between him and his wife.\n\nThings improve. Stephen is promoted and assigned to a large city in the south. The Chases becomes good friends with another couple, Don and Alice Wellman (John Eldredge and Jean Muir). Don works for Stephen, but he is so contemptuous of the Chinese that two important clients refuse to renew their contracts unless he is fired. Stephen is torn, but does let Don go. Don's replacement is McCarger. Despite a prolonged drought and an outbreak of cholera, Stephen ruthlessly collects payment from his customers, earning the best record of any branch in China.\n\nThen, communists take over the city. An officer (Keye Luke) shows up at the company's offices and demands the gold stored in the safe. Stephen bargains with him and gets everyone except McCarger and himself evacuated to a ship by promising to give up the gold in a few hours. In the meantime, he sends for Ho (Tetsu Komai), a very well-connected Chinese customer and good friend, hoping he can use his influence. When Ho bravely shows up however, he is shot down in cold blood by the soldiers. Outraged, Stephen and McCarger take the gold and escape out the back door. McCarger is killed and Stephen wounded, but a passing boat rescues him and the gold.\n\nIn the hospital, he is visited by the new man in charge of the Orient for the company. Stephen is delighted to be offered the position of his assistant. However, when his boss outlines his plan to institute modern business practices, Stephen disagrees, explaining that, despite appearances, the \"new\" China is still run by the old ways. When he recovers, he is humiliated to learn that his job has been given to another man as a result. Further, he is given only menial tasks in an effort to get him to quit (and thus forfeit his pension). Hester gives Stephen's boss a tongue-lashing and reveals that her husband holds the patent for a lamp the company uses to popularize the use of its product. However, it is a call from the president of Atlantis, disturbed by the news that Stephen has been passed over for the job, that changes the man's mind. Stephen's shaken faith in the company is restored.\n\n\nWriting for \"The Spectator\" in 1935, Graham Greene described the conceit of the film as excellent, but lamented that \"so interesting a theme should have been passed first through the mind of a good, sincere and sentimental woman and then through the mind of a perhaps less sincere but certainly not less sentimental Hollywood scenario-writer\".\n\n"}

Only four of the Abe children survived to adulthood, and of those, Sada was the youngest. Abe's father, Shigeyoshi Abe, was originally from Chiba Prefecture. He had been adopted into the Abe family to help with the business, which he eventually inherited. Aged 52 at the time of Sada's birth, Shigeyoshi Abe was described by police as \"an honest and upright man\" who had neither conspicuous vices nor any brushes with the law, although some acquaintances reported him to be somewhat self-centered, with a taste for extravagance. Sada's mother, Katsu Abe, likewise had no known legal or moral blemishes on her record.\n\nHer brother Shintarō was known as a womanizer, and after his marriage, ran away with his parents' money. Sada's sister Teruko was also known to have had several lovers. Her father sent her to work in a brothel, then not an uncommon way to punish female sexual promiscuity in Japan, although he soon bought her back. Teruko's past was not considered a hindrance to marriage for those of the Abes' class at the time, and she soon married.\n\nSada Abe was born in 1905. Her mother doted on Sada, who was her youngest surviving child, and allowed her to do as she wished. She encouraged Abe to take lessons in singing and in playing the \"shamisen\", both activities which, at the time, were more closely associated with geishas and prostitutes than with classical artistic endeavor. Geishas were considered glamorous celebrities at the time, and Abe herself pursued this image by skipping school for her musical lessons, and wearing stylish make-up. As family problems over her siblings, sister Teruko and brother Shintarō, became more pressing, Abe was often sent out of the house alone. She soon fell in with a group of similarly independent teenagers. At the age of 14, during one of her outings with this group, she was raped by one of her acquaintances. Her parents initially defended and supported her, but she became a difficult teenager. As she became more irresponsible and uncontrollable, her parents sold her to a geisha house in Yokohama in 1922, hoping to find her a place in society with some direction. Toku Abe, Sada's oldest sister, testified that Sada wished to become a geisha. Sada herself, however, claimed that her father made her a geisha as punishment for her promiscuity.\n\nAbe's encounter with the geisha world proved to be a frustrating and disappointing one. To become a true star among geisha required apprenticeship from childhood with years spent training and studying arts and music. Abe never progressed beyond a low rank, at which one of her main duties was to provide sex for clients. She worked for five years in this capacity, and eventually contracted syphilis. Since this meant she would be required to undergo regular physical examinations, as would a legally licensed prostitute, Abe decided to enter that better-paying profession.\n\nAbe began work as a prostitute in Osaka's famous Tobita brothel district, but soon gained a reputation as a trouble-maker. She stole money from clients, and attempted to leave the brothel several times, but was soon tracked down by the well-organized legal prostitution system. After two years, she eventually succeeded in escaping the licensed prostitution system, and began working as a waitress. However, not satisfied with the wages, she was soon working as a prostitute again, though now unlicensed, and began working in the unlicensed brothels of Osaka in 1932. Abe's mother died in January 1933, and Abe traveled to Tokyo to visit her father, and her mother's grave. She entered into the prostitution market in Tokyo and while there became a mistress for the first time. When her father became gravely ill in January 1934, Abe nursed him for ten days until his death.\n\nIn October 1934 Abe was arrested in a police raid on the unlicensed brothel at which she was working at the time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, \"She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long ... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted.\" When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, \"She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear.\" Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, \"He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up.\"\n\nIn Nagoya in 1935, and again intending to leave the sex industry, Abe began working as a maid at a restaurant. She soon became romantically involved with a customer at the restaurant, Gorō Ōmiya, a professor and banker who aspired to become a member of the Diet of Japan (Japanese parliament). Knowing that the restaurant would not tolerate a maid having sexual relations with clients, and having become bored with Nagoya, she returned to Tokyo in June. Ōmiya met Abe in Tokyo, and, finding that she had in the past contracted syphilis, paid for her stay at a hot springs resort in Kusatsu from November until January 1936. In January, Ōmiya suggested that Abe could become financially independent by opening a small restaurant, and recommended that she should start working as an apprentice in the restaurant business.\n\nBack in Tokyo, Abe began work as an apprentice at the Yoshidaya restaurant on February 1, 1936. The owner of this establishment, Kichizō Ishida, 42 at the time, had worked his way up in business, starting as an apprentice at a restaurant specializing in eel dishes. He had opened the Yoshidaya in Tokyo's Nakano neighborhood in 1920. When Abe joined his restaurant, Ishida had become known as a womanizer who by that time did little in the way of actually running the restaurant, which had become in fact managed primarily by his wife.\n\nNot long after Abe began work at Yoshidaya, Ishida began making amorous advances towards her. Ōmiya had never satisfied Abe sexually, and she gave in to Ishida. In mid-April, Ishida and Abe initiated their sexual relationship in the restaurant to the accompaniment of a romantic ballad sung by one of the restaurant's geishas. On April 23, 1936, Abe and Ishida met for a pre-arranged sexual encounter at a teahouse, or \"machiai\"—the contemporary equivalent of a love hotel—in the Shibuya neighborhood. Planning only for a short \"fling\", the couple instead remained in bed for four days. On the night of April 27, 1936, they moved to another teahouse in the distant neighborhood of Futako Tamagawa where they continued to drink and have sex, occasionally with the accompaniment of a geisha's singing, and would continue even as maids entered the room to serve sake. They next moved to the Ogu neighborhood, and Ishida did not actually return to his restaurant until the morning of May 8, 1936, after an absence of about two weeks. Of Ishida, Abe later said, \"It is hard to say exactly what was so good about Ishida. But it was impossible to say anything bad about his looks, his attitude, his skill as a lover, the way he expressed his feelings. I had never met such a sexy man.\"\n\nAfter their two-week encounter ended, Abe became agitated and began drinking excessively. She said that with Ishida she had come to know true love for the first time in her life, and the thought of Ishida being back with his wife made her intensely jealous. Just over a week before Ishida's eventual death, Abe began to contemplate his murder. On May 9, 1936, she attended a play in which a geisha attacks her lover with a large knife, after which she decided to threaten Ishida with a knife at their next meeting. On May 11, 1936, Abe pawned some of her clothing and used the money to buy a kitchen knife. She later described meeting Ishida that night, \"I pulled the kitchen knife out of my bag and threatened him as had been done in the play I had seen, saying, 'Kichi, you wore that kimono just to please one of your favorite customers. You bastard, I'll kill you for that.' Ishida was startled and drew away a little, but he seemed delighted with it all ...\"\n\nIshida and Abe returned to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife to the base of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her \"obi\" sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, \"You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you ... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward.\" Abe commented that she wondered if he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.\n\nAbout 2 a.m. on the morning of May 18, 1936, as Ishida was asleep, Abe wrapped her sash twice around his neck and strangled him to death. She later told police, \"After I had killed Ishida I felt totally at ease, as though a heavy burden had been lifted from my shoulders, and I felt a sense of clarity.\" After lying with Ishida's body for a few hours, she next severed his genitalia with the kitchen knife, wrapped them in a magazine cover, and kept them until her arrest three days later. With the blood she wrote on Ishida's left thigh, and on a bed sheet. She then carved (\"Sada\", the character for her name) into his left arm. After putting on Ishida's underwear, she left the inn at about 8 a.m., telling the staff not to disturb Ishida. \n\nAfter leaving the inn, Abe met her former lover Gorō Ōmiya. She repeatedly apologized to him, but Ōmiya, unaware of the murder, assumed that she was apologizing for having taken another lover. In actuality, Abe's apologies were for the damage to his political career that she knew his association with her was bound to cause. After Ishida's body was discovered, a search was launched for Abe, who had gone missing. On May 19, 1936, the newspapers picked up the story. Ōmiya's career was ruined, and Abe's life was under intense public scrutiny from that point onwards.\n\nThe circumstances of the death of Ishida immediately caused a national sensation. The ensuing frenzy over the search for Abe was called \"Abe Sada panic\". Police received reports of sightings of Abe from various cities, and one false sighting nearly caused a stampede in the Ginza, resulting in a large traffic jam. In a reference to the recent failed coup in Tokyo, the Ni Ni-Roku Incident (\"2–26\" or \"February 26\"), the crime was satirically dubbed the \"Go Ichi-Hachi\" Incident (\"5–18\" or \"May 18\").\n\nOn May 19, 1936, Abe went shopping and saw a movie. Under a pseudonym, she stayed in an inn in Shinagawa on May 20, where she had a massage and drank three bottles of beer. She spent the day writing farewell letters to Ōmiya, a friend, and Ishida. She planned to commit suicide one week after the murder, and practiced necrophilia. \"I felt attached to Ishida's penis and thought that only after taking leave from it quietly could I then die. I unwrapped the paper holding them and gazed at his penis and scrotum. I put his penis in my mouth and even tried to insert it inside me ... It didn't work however though I kept trying and trying. Then, I decided that I would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida's penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on Mount Ikoma while holding on to his penis.\"\n\nAt 4:00 in the afternoon, police detectives, suspicious of the alias under which Abe had registered, came to her room. \"Don't be so formal\", she told them, \"You're looking for Sada Abe, right? Well that's me. I am Sada Abe.\" When the police were not convinced, she displayed Ishida's genitalia as proof.\n\nAbe was arrested and interrogated over eight sessions. When asked why she had severed Ishida's genitalia, Abe replied, \"Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I wanted to take the part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories.\" The interrogating officer was struck by Abe's demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. \"Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way.\" Her answer was: \"I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. But since we were not husband and wife, as long as he lived he could be embraced by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him ...\" In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe's case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan, William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation. \"She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love.\" Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe incident occurred at a time when the Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the \"Ni-Ni-Roku\" incident and a looming full-scale war in China. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time. The incident also struck a chord with the \"ero-guro-nansensu\" (\"erotic-grotesque-nonsense\") style popular at the time, and the Sada Abe Incident came to represent that genre for years to come.\n\nWhen the details of the crime were made public, rumors began to circulate that Ishida's penis was of extraordinary size; however, the police officer who interrogated Abe after her arrest denied this, saying, \"Ishida's was just average. [Abe] told me, 'Size doesn't make a man in bed. Technique and his desire to please me were what I liked about Ishida. After her arrest, Ishida's penis and testicles were moved to Tokyo University Medical School's pathology museum. They were put on public display soon after the end of World War II, but have since disappeared.\n\nThe first day of Abe's trial was November 25, 1936, and by 5 a.m. crowds were already gathering to attend. The judge presiding over the trial admitted to being sexually aroused by some of the details involved in the case, yet made sure that the trial was held with the utmost seriousness. Abe's statement before receiving sentencing began, \"The thing I regret most about this incident is that I have come to be misunderstood as some kind of sexual pervert ... There had never been a man in my life like Ishida. There were men I liked, and with whom I slept without accepting money, but none made me feel the way I did toward him.\"\n\nOn December 21, 1936, Abe was convicted of murder in the second degree and mutilation of a corpse. Though the prosecution demanded ten years, and Abe claimed that she desired the death penalty, she was in fact sentenced to just six years in prison. She was confined in Tochigi women's penitentiary, where she was prisoner No. 11. Abe's sentence was commuted on November 10, 1940, on the occasion of the 2,600th anniversary celebrations of the mythical founding of Japan, when Emperor Jimmu came to the throne. She was released, exactly five years after the murder, on May 17, 1941.\n\nThe police record of Abe's interrogation and confession became a national best-seller in 1936. Christine L. Marran puts the national fascination with Abe's story within the context of the or \"poison woman\" stereotype, a transgressive female character type that had first become popular in Japanese serialized novels and stage works in the 1870s. In the wake of the popular \"poison woman\" literature, confessional autobiographies by female criminals had begun appearing in the late 1890s. By the early 1910s, autobiographical writings by criminal women took on an unapologetic tone and sometimes included criticisms of Japan and Japanese society. Kanno Suga, who was hanged in 1911 for conspiring to assassinate Emperor Meiji in what was known as the High Treason Incident, wrote openly rebellious essays while in prison. Fumiko Kaneko, who was sentenced to death for plotting to bomb the imperial family, used her notoriety to speak against the imperial system and the racism and paternalism that she said it engendered. Abe's confession, in the years since its appearance, became the most circulated female criminal narrative in Japan. Marran points out that Abe, unlike previous criminal autobiographers, stressed her sexuality and the love she felt for her victim.\n\nUpon release from prison, Abe assumed an alias. As the mistress of a \"serious man\" she referred to in her memoirs as \"Y\", she moved first to Ibaraki Prefecture and then to Saitama Prefecture. When Abe's true identity became known to Y's friends and family, she broke off their relationship.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, wishing to divert public attention from politics and criticism of the occupying authorities, the Yoshida government encouraged a \"3-S\" policy—\"sports, screen, and sex\". Pre-war writings, such as \"The Psychological Diagnosis of Abe Sada\" (1937) depict Abe as an example of the dangers of unbridled female sexuality and as a threat to the patriarchal system. In the postwar era, she was treated as a critic of totalitarianism, and a symbol of freedom from oppressive political ideologies. Abe became a popular subject in literature of both high and low quality. The \"buraiha\" writer Oda Sakunosuke wrote two stories based on Abe, and a June 1949 article noted that Abe had recently tried to clear her name after it had been used in a \"mountain\" of erotic books.\n\nIn 1946 the writer Ango Sakaguchi interviewed Abe, treating her as an authority on both sexuality and freedom. Sakaguchi called Abe a \"tender, warm figure of salvation for future generations\". In 1947 Ichiro Kimura's \"The Erotic Confessions of Abe Sada\" became a national best-seller, with over 100,000 copies sold. The book was in the form of an interview with Sada Abe, but was actually based on the police interrogation records. As a response to this book, Abe wrote her own autobiography, \"Memoirs of Abe Sada\", which was published in 1948. In contrast to Kimura's depiction of her as a pervert, she stressed her love for Ishida. The first edition of the magazine , in January 1948, featured previously unpublished photos of the incident with the headline \"Ero-guro of the Century! First Public Release. Pictorial of the Abe Sada Incident.\" Reflecting the change in tone in writings on Abe, the June 1949 issue of \"Monthly Reader\" calls her a \"Heroine of That Time\", for following her own desires in a time of \"false morality\" and oppression.\n\nAbe capitalized on her notoriety by sitting for an interview in a popular magazine, and appearing for several years starting in 1947 in a traveling one-act stage production called \"Shōwa Ichidai Onna\" (\"A Woman of the Shōwa Period\") under the direction of dramatist Nagata Mikihiko. In 1952 she began working at the Hoshikikusui, a working-class pub in Inari-chō in downtown Tokyo. She lived a low-profile life in Tokyo's Shitaya neighborhood for the next 20 years, and her neighborhood restaurant association gave her a \"model employee\" award. More than once, during the 1960s, film-critic Donald Richie visited the Hoshikikusui. In his collection of profiles, \"Japanese Portraits\", he describes Abe making a dramatic entrance into a boisterous group of drinkers. She would slowly descend a long staircase that led into the middle of the crowd, fixing a haughty gaze on individuals in her audience. The men in the pub would respond by putting their hands over their crotches, and shouting out things like, \"Hide the knives!\" and \"I'm afraid to go and pee!\" Abe would slap the banister in anger and stare the crowd into an uncomfortable and complete silence, and only then continue her entrance, chatting and pouring drinks from table to table. Richie comments, \"... she had actually choked a man to death and then cut off his member. There was a consequent frisson when Sada Abe slapped your back.\"\n\nIn 1969 Abe appeared in the \"Sada Abe Incident\" section of director Teruo Ishii's dramatized documentary , and the last known photograph of Abe was taken in August of that year. She disappeared from the public eye in 1970. When the film \"In the Realm of the Senses\" was being planned in the mid-1970s, director Nagisa Oshima apparently sought out Abe and, after a long search, found her, her hair shorn, in a Kansai nunnery.\n\nDecades after both the incident and her disappearance, Sada Abe continues to draw public interest. In addition to the documentary in which Abe herself appeared shortly before she disappeared from the public eye, and the 1976 Japanese-language \"In the Realm of the Senses\", at least three successful films have been made based on the story. The 1983 film, \"Sexy Doll: Abe Sada Sansei\", made use of Abe's name in the title. In 1998, a 438-page biography of Abe was published in Japan, and the first full-length book on Abe in English, William Johnston's \"Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan\", was published in 2005.\n\nJapanese Noise musician Merzbow adopted the alias Abe Sada for an early musical project. He released only one record under this name, the 1994 7\" \"Original Body Kingdom/Gala Abe Sada 1936\".\n\nIn March 2007, a four-bass noise band from Perth, Western Australia, named Abe Sada won a Contemporary Music Grant from the Australian Department of Culture and the Arts to tour Japan in June and July 2007.\n\n\"Selected major writings on Sada Abe\"\n\n\nAlso, there have been at least five films based on her life:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3521240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3521240", "title": "The Bureau: XCOM Declassified", "text": "The Bureau: XCOM Declassified\n\nThe Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a science fiction video game in the \"X-COM\" series, developed by 2K Marin and was released by 2K Games for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on August 20, 2013 in North America. It was released for Mac on November 27, 2013 by Transgaming. The game had been in development under different titles by three different studios since 2006. It was unveiled as a first-person shooter titled \"XCOM\" in June 2010 and was repeatedly delayed until its release. In April 2013, the game was rebranded as \"The Bureau: XCOM Declassified\". In its final version, it became a third-person tactical shooter with strategy video game elements.\n\n\"The Bureau\" is a third-person shooter with an emphasis on squad-based tactics. The player controls the agent William Carter and commands two additional agents in each mission. Carter has several unique abilities, such as healing his entire squad, lifting enemies out of cover, and summoning combat drones. The other agents are divided into four classes: Commando, Engineer, Support, and Recon. Each class is proficient in a different set of powers and weapon types. For example, the Commando class is specialized in offensive abilities and rifles, while the Engineer class relies on land mines, automatic turrets, and the use of shotguns. As Carter and his squad gain more experience points during missions, more abilities become available.\n\nBy entering \"Battle Focus Mode\", which slows time significantly, the player can order their agents to move to tactical positions and activate class-specific abilities. Agents have customizable outfits, weapons, equipment, and abilities. As in \"\", if Carter is unable to revive agents who have taken too much damage, they will die (variable difficulty levels also determine whether or not it is possible for downed agents to become battle-ready when revived, or if replacement agents will appear during a mission). The agents who die will be dead for the rest of the game.\n\nThroughout the course of the game, the player can collect backpack schematics and alien weapons, which then become available for the entire squad. Each backpack provides a unique bonus to the agent wearing it. For example, the Sharpshooter Pack provides bonus head-shot damage, and the Guardian Pack reduces damage taken from attacks. These equipments can be altered before a mission, or at Resupply Stations located in each mission.\n\nThe game is set in late 1962, at the height of the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union. Prior to the events of the game, U.S. President John F. Kennedy authorized the creation of the Bureau of Strategic Emergency Command, which was intended to coordinate U.S. military forces in the event of a Soviet invasion of the USA. A top-secret underground command bunker was constructed to house the Bureau, and specific military and civilian personnel were secretly contacted and told to report there in the event of an invasion. The Bureau's director, Myron Faulke, had another vision for his organization: a bulwark against attacks from \"Outsiders\", hostile extraterrestrial forces whom he believed had been operating on Earth for the past six months and had some connection to the recently discovered \"super-element\" Elerium. As the game begins, CIA special agent William Carter is tasked with delivering an important package to Faulke at the Bureau's research labs at Groom Range.\n\nWaiting in a room at the Groom Range facility for Director Faulke's summons, William Carter meets a military officer who informs him that she is to escort him to Faulke to deliver a briefcase. When a wary Carter refuses, a black fluid discharges from the officer's eyes, revealing her to be \"infected\"; she then shoots Carter and opens the case. It emits a blinding light which incinerates the officer and stuns Carter. Moments later, Carter awakens to find his gunshot wound inexplicably healed and the case destroyed as the base comes under attack. Carter attempts to rescue Faulke as the attackers, identified as \"Outsiders\" by Bureau agents whom Carter encounters, easily slaughter the base's garrison. He eventually finds Faulke, but is too late to save the VIP officials J. Edgar Hoover, CIA Director Frost, and General Deems, the latter of whom had become infected (in the same manner as the female officer) and killed the other officials. Carter escapes the Groom Range facility by tram just as Outsider devices cause the mountain to implode, and stalls the Outsider pursuit by detonating a powerful Elerium bomb while he and Faulke flee via Skyranger helicopter.\n\nAt the Bureau's command bunker, Faulke announces that communications worldwide have been jammed and other U.S. military bases have been destroyed in similar attacks. With no way to contact the White House and other American military leaders, Faulke formally activates the Bureau (now renamed XCOM) and assumes control of the country's remaining military forces to counter the Outsider threat, while Bureau operatives planted in major cities downplay the attacks as safety drills to keep the civilian populace from panicking.\n\nOver the following weeks, Carter leads teams of agents across the country to retrieve important personnel, defend strategic sites, and recover what alien technology they can for research. Gradually, the Bureau pieces together the Outsiders' motive: to conquer the Earth and terraform it into a new homeworld, simultaneously enslaving humanity. The interrogation of an Outsider Infiltrator reveals that their species is commanded by an entity known as Origin through a psionic network called Mosaic. Carter's team travels through a \"Venn Portal\" to their homeworld using the Avenger, a flying saucer XCOM has developed. There, Carter discovers that Mosaic is powered by an enslaved Ethereal, a being of pure energy with immense psionic power. The Outsiders have been searching for a dormant Ethereal on Earth, which is revealed to have been inside of Carter's briefcase from the game's opening and now inhabits his body. He manages to capture Origin's Ethereal, detonates a bomb at Mosaic's entry point and returns to Earth.\n\nAt XCOM's base, the captured Ethereal, Shamash, psionically contacts the Ethereal inside of Carter, Asaru. It becomes apparent that the player has actually been playing as Asaru, who has in turn been psionically controlling William Carter, though its recently awakened state caused it to believe it truly was human. Shamash claims that because both the Outsiders and humans have learned how to capture Ethereal, they must be destroyed so that a force like Mosaic will never be rebuilt. Upon hearing this, Carter manages to temporarily break free of Asaru and kills Shamash. XCOM's base is discovered by the Outsiders, and Carter attempts to defend it, while actively attempting to break free from Asaru's control. Carter manages to plant an explosive device with a thirty-second timer, believing that the Ethereal will never truly allow him to be free.\n\nThere are four endings depending on choices made at this point. If Asaru refuses to relinquish control of Carter, the bomb will go off, killing both of them.\n\nAlternatively, Asaru can release Carter, but only to willingly merge with either Dr. Weir, Agent Weaver, or Director Faulke. The new host will knock Carter unconscious and the remaining agents will abandon the base. They discover that Origin still exists within what remains of the Mosaic network, and has transported itself to Earth's orbit in order to command the Outsiders stranded on the planet. The crew of the Avenger mounts their final attack against Origin's ship, with Asaru providing the new host with the powers it had given Carter. During the mission, one of the other two host options must be sacrificed while the other is rescued, and Carter, who believes that Asaru is no different from the Outsiders, must be either executed or incarcerated. Eventually, Asaru's host discovers a secondary entry point for Mosaic and psionically integrates with the network, destroying Origin and its influence over the Outsiders.\n\nThe aftermath of the Outsider invasion is revealed in the form of a debriefing of Asaru's host:\n\nIn any case, the Outsider invasion is successfully covered up, with only the members of XCOM and a handful of top U.S. and other world leaders aware of how close the human race came to extinction.\n\nThe debriefing concludes with a description of how Asaru eventually severs contact with its host and departs after the Outsiders are dealt with, and its intentions remain unknown. At this point, the musical score segues into a theme from \"XCOM: Enemy Unknown\".\n\nIn early 2006, Irrational Games was purchased by publisher Take-Two Interactive, who had also acquired the \"X-COM\" IP from Atari the year before. Shortly after, two Irrational studios in Boston (later renamed 2K Boston) and Canberra (later renamed 2K Australia) began conceptualization of a new game in the series. The video gaming press picked up multiple hints on the development throughout the period leading up to the official reveal in 2010. In May 2006, Irrational Games announced they were hiring for a work \"On the sequel to one of the best loved PC franchises of all time.\" By February 2007, there were unconfirmed rumors about a new \"X-COM\" game being developed by Irrational Games. Several concept pitches were created early on in the development. One was of a tactical strategy sequel to the original series that would be built on an upgraded \"Freedom Force\" engine. Another cast the player in the role of a human resistance leader in a post-invasion scenario, featuring highly stylized, cartoonish character models. One pitch, in which the player would be based on a hijacked alien craft, was even made into a full demo that was supposed to be shown at E3, but never was. However, much of the studios' resources were focused on the development of \"BioShock\" and on supporting the sequel's development, which was handled by an ex-Irrational studio 2K Marin in California, so the pre-production progressed very slowly. The aforementioned concepts involving a post-invasion scenario and hijacked alien craft would eventually see implementation into \"XCOM 2\", developed by Firaxis Games as a sequel to \"XCOM: Enemy Unknown\".\n\nUpon the completion of \"BioShock 2\" in early 2010, the Canberra studio pitched a concept of the \"X-COM\" game as \"the meets \"The X-Files\", set in the 1950s to 1960s.\" The game was decided to be to a first-person shooter set in the 1950s and combining missions on the field with base management; an important part of the game would be taking photographs on the field for research. This green-lighted pitch was originally titled \"X-COM: Enemy Unknown\" (not to be confused with as well as ) and featured mysterious aliens taking abstract forms such as globs of black goo and levitating geometrical shapes, in addition to masquerading as humans in a manner reminiscent of the 1956 film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\". A multiplayer mode was also in development, described as similar in concept to the \"Aliens vs. Predator\" game series, but it was later scrapped altogether.\n\nThe game was officially announced on April 14, 2010, titled simply \"XCOM\". In development for the Xbox 360 and PC, it was described as a \"re-imagining of one of gaming's most storied and beloved franchises.\" In-game footage was first shown at E3 2010 in June 2010. It was later retrospectively described as a survival horror title, \"like a \"Silent Hill\" sort of game, where it's sort of the cerebral horror versus the run and gun horror game.\" Regarding a move away from the strategy genre, 2K Games president Christoph Hartmann said at the time \"strategy games are just not contemporary,\" but the developers later assured they would keep elements from the original game, such as squad and base management, free-form non-linear mission progression, and squad-based tactical combat. \"XCOM\" was originally announced to arrive in 2011, but then got repeatedly delayed. It was first officially rescheduled to launch on March 6, 2012, before being delayed again, supposed to come out before March 31, 2013. By April 2012, it was estimated to be released between April 2013 and March 2014.\n\nAlready prior to the game's E3 2010 debut, the developers began experiencing various difficulties both creatively and technically. Earlier in the year, 2K publishing had assigned a large portion of 2K Marin to assist 2K Australia in developing the game, and soon the two studios were merged under the name \"2K Marin\". The Australian branch worked on the single-player component while the California branch was assigned the multiplayer mode (described as resembling \"Left 4 Dead\" and ultimately scrapped). However, the two \"2K Marin\" studios in California and Australia were slowed down by communication issues, and they found it difficult to implement the stealth gameplay and the themes of mystery and field research. The Australian studio also lost several key members, with the game's original lead designer Ed Orman and art director Andrew James leaving 2K Marin to form Uppercut Games in 2011. The American branch gradually took upon a leading role, having been forced to abandon development of their own new IP and to finish up what was supposed to be a quick release of \"X-COM\".\n\nFollowing widespread criticism of the original project from \"X-COM\" fan community and parts of the media, as well as the problems with developing the game, \"XCOM\" got thoroughly revamped by 2011, evolving into a linear tactical shooter (with no randomized missions and no stealth and detective gameplay elements, but with more control over other agents) seen from a third-person view (the E3 2011 demo version showed a first-person shooter gameplay nevertheless). The setting was also changed, including an introduction of humanoid enemies and the timeline being pushed forward from the 1950s to 1962 in order to explore cultural tensions of the 1960s. The player could now enter a tactical-view mode, during which the game paused for a while, to \"use time units to order the two agents traveling with him on the field.\" According to GameSpy, \"the core aspects of the game are about working with a team of agents who have a variety of classes that you can customize, to have certain abilities that assist you on missions (think RPG party building),\" using \"experience points where you can level them up or upgrade them along different paths.\" The player was also offered to choose the missions from a variety of choices, \"each offering different strategic options.\"\n\nIn 2012, the game's narrative Jordan Thomas left the \"XCOM\" team, asked by Ken Levine to help 2K Boston finish \"BioShock Infinite\", while 2K Australia has regained its name and was also reassigned to a support work on \"Infinite\". Zak McClendon, the lead designer of \"BioShock 2\", became the lead designer for the struggling \"XCOM\" project. Following the success of \"XCOM: Enemy Unknown\", developed by Firaxis Games and released by 2K Games in October 2012, 2K Games decided to have both of the \"XCOM\" games related more closely to each other, including sharing some of the alien species such as the series' iconic Sectoids. Meanwhile, no new materials related to the game were officially released since the showing at E3 2011. In late 2012, the game was rumored by Kotaku to be \"coming back as a third-person shooter. While the 1960s setting and general \"XCOM\" prequel vibe remains, it's now apparently being pitched as a squad-based game similar to \"SOCOM\" or \"\"\" and \"is being developed by the same people who created \"BioShock 2\".\" According to the rumor, which was accompanied by several leaked screenshots and repeated by many other publications, the game would be released only for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and possibly as a $30 downloadable title. \n\nIn April 2013, the game's official website xcom.com/xcom was deleted without any official explanation, while all videos relating to it suddenly disappeared from 2K Games' official YouTube channel as well. One month earlier, 2K Games had registered the Internet domains thebureau-game.com, thebureau-game.net, whathappenedin62.com, and whathappenedin62.net, indicating that the game might return with a new title, possibly as \"The Bureau\". VideoGamer.com received a package containing a dossier labeled \"Burn After Opening\", containing materials confirming a link between \"XCOM\" and the name \"The Bureau\". GameZone's analysis of a viral teaser video \"What Happened in 62\" predicted that the redesigned \"XCOM\" would reappear on April 26. On April 24, 2013, 2K posted an announcement titled \"2K Marin's [redacted] is coming soon\":\n\nThe \"XCOM\" universe is expanding. In the coming days the world will get a fresh look at the long-awaited squad-based tactical shooter in development at 2K Marin. Announced back in 2010, the game has undergone an evolution since we last showed it to you at E3 2011. Firaxis' critically acclaimed turn-based strategy title, \"XCOM: Enemy Unknown\", has reignited the classic franchise and we feel that the time is right to deliver a new experience within the world of \"XCOM\". The creative development of this game has been a collaborative process of discovery and iteration. 2K's culture allows our studios the freedom to refine their visions, to explore new ideas, and to deliver the best possible experiences for players. Through this exploration, 2K Marin has refined their vision, and as a result the game has evolved into a high-stakes narrative experience imbued with core \"XCOM\" concepts. The wait is nearly over and we can't wait to share more details with you about the game in only a matter of days.\n\n\"The Bureau: XCOM Declassified\" was officially unveiled as a full-priced title along with a live-action trailer on April 26, with a planned release date of August 20, 2013. The first actual gameplay footage trailer for \"The Bureau\", with developer commentary, was released on May 13, 2013.\n\n\"The Bureau\" pre-order bonuses included a Light Plasma Pistol weapon and the minor operation \"Codebreakers\". On October 8, 2013, downloadable content \"Hangar 6 R&D\" was released for the Xbox 360, containing a series of missions set shortly before the main game that follow Nico DaSilva, as he takes part in psychic experiments in order to combat the Sleepwalker virus. DaSilva also possesses new abilities and perks and can acquire new weapons, such as the AK-47 and Microwave Gun.\n\nThe initial public reaction to the reveal of the \"XCOM\" reboot in 2010 was negative. Destructoid called it \"the first-person shooter that the Internet loves to hate\", and \"\" designer and \"X-COM\" series creator Julian Gollop criticized the original-announcement version of the game for abandoning the turn-based combat system of the original games. Gollop later suggested that the \"1950s style alternate reality thing\" and FPS nature of the game had not been well received, although he thought that graphically the game was \"amazing\".\n\nThe reactions improved when \"XCOM\" was re-designed with third-person viewpoints and a tactical pause mode. 1UP.com called the revised version \"the dark horse\" of E3 2011. According to IGN, \"\"XCOM\" the FPS was announced before , so fans cried foul at defiling such a sacred series. But with top-notch style and a focus on team-based combat, the new take on \"XCOM\" might turn fans into believers when it finally releases in 2013.\"\n\n\"The Bureau: XCOM Declassified\" received generally mixed or average reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Xbox 360 version 69.96% and 68/100, the PlayStation 3 version 65.56% and 69/100 and the PC version 61.91% and 66/100. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer gave the game a score of 7/10, arguing that while the game was not necessary in the wake of \"Enemy Unknown\", it can still be enjoyed as a tactical shooter. Joystiq's Ludwig Kietzmann praised the game's open-ended environments and gave the game four stars out of five. Destructoid's Jim Sterling, however, opined that the game \"wants to be \"XCOM\" without being \"XCOM\". As such, it is nothing,\" criticising the strategy elements and ultimately giving the game a rating of 4.5 out of 10.\n\n"}

Hall\n\nTrevor Henry Hall (1910–1991) was a British author, surveyor, and sceptic of paranormal phenomena. Hall made controversial claims regarding early members of the Society for Psychical Research. His books caused a heated controversy within the parapsychology community.\n\nHall was born in Wakefield, England. He served as a major in the British army during World War II (1939–45) and became a senior partner of V. Walker and Son (chartered surveyors) (1945–80), he was the vice president of the Huddersfield Building Society (1958–80).\n\nHe had a deep interest in magic and mystery. Hall was a student in psychical research at Trinity College, Cambridge (1954–56). His knowledge of conjuring and magic helped him discover the tricks of mediums, many of whom had been caught in fraud. Hall was an ex-member and critic of the Society for Psychical Research and published a series of sceptical books on the paranormal and psychical research. He was a collector of magic books and was a member of The Magic Circle. He also wrote three books on the higher criticism of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nIn his controversial book \"The Spiritualists\" (1962), Hall stated that the famous medium Florence Cook was a fraud who had an affair with the chemist and psychical researcher William Crookes.\n\nHall drew upon Francis G. H. Anderson's statements to the Society for Psychical Research in 1922 and 1941. Anderson claimed to have had an affair with Cook himself, he also stated that she was a sexual maniac who confessed to having an affair with Crookes. In 1964, psychical researchers R. G. Medhurst and K. M. Goldney cast considerable doubt on the reliability of Anderson's testimony and dismissed Hall's allegations. Biographer William Hodson Brock who has praised Hall's book also doubted the claims of an affair.\n\nRegarding Hall's research that Cook had an affair with Crookes, historian Asa Briggs in a review commented that \"the verdict does not seem to be fully proven, although the evidence is striking\".\n\nPsychologist Ray Hyman has noted that despite how one may consider the allegations, \"there is no question that Hall has unearthed much material that throws strong suspicions on Crookes's handling of this investigation.\" Researchers such as Ruth Brandon and Eric Dingwall have supported Hall's arguments against Cook and Crookes.\n\nIn his book \"The Strange Case of Edmund Gurney\" (1964), Hall made the claim that Edmund Gurney committed suicide after discovering the frauds of Douglas Blackburn and George Albert Smith. This has been strongly contested by biographer Trevor Hamilton and the psychical researcher Alan Gauld.\n\nParapsychologist Fraser Nicol published an extremely negative review of Hall's book on Gurney, this caused a threat of a libel action from Hall.\n\nIn his book \"The Enigma of Daniel Home: Medium or Fraud?\" (1984), Hall asserted that the medium Daniel Dunglas Home had invented his aristocratic background.\n\nHall's research led him to conclude that the alleged levitation of Home at Ashley House never happened as the eyewitness reports contradicted each other and all Home did was step across a gap of four feet between two iron balconies.\n\nResearcher Georgess McHargue noted that Hall was \"one of the most astute of modern investigators, combining twentieth-century scientific techniques with a cheerful and readable writing style in his many books.\" However, Roger Luckhurst has written that Halls \"books proceed with a combination of careful archival work and abusive character assassinations.\"\n\nIn the book \"A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology\" (1985), authors Gerd H. Hövelmann, Marcello Truzzi and Piet Hein Hoebens noted that \"[al]though Hall's historical detective work is often impressive, his conclusions sometimes go beyond his data. Despite the flaws in some of Hall's efforts, his writings should be required reading for everyone interested in early psychical research.\"\n\n\n"}
