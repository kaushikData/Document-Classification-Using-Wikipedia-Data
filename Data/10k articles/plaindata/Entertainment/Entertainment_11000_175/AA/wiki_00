The screenplay by Smallhorne, Terry McGoff, and Fergus Tighe focuses on the bisexual foreman of a construction worker of a New York City construction crew.\n\nAt the January 1998 Sundance Film Festival, the film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize and Declan Quinn won the Cinematography Award. It was released in New York City on November 26, 1999.\n\nJohnnie Maher is under a lot of pressure. Recently emigrated from Ireland to The Bronx, he sleepwalks and experiences nightmares. Try as he might, he can not identify the cause of his torment or make sense of the fleeting remains of his dreams. He shrugs them off, but things seem to be getting worse. Johnnie works as foreman on his uncle Trump's construction crew. Work tensions run high as the building owners complain about the cost and pace, while the workers constantly find their pay-packets shorted. Sly as a fox, Uncle Trump always explains everything away. Even when arrested for indecent exposure in a park frequented by gay men on the prowl for sex, he handily swears he only stopped there to relieve himself and was arrested by mistake. Openly bisexual, Johnnie's pressures mount when his girlfriend, Maria, and a sex-partner, Christian, begin to pressure him for more commitment. He fumbles his responses, and no one is satisfied. Finally, Johnnie catches his Uncle Trump in an act that fractures the dam of memories, and in a short time, they come flooding back into Johnnie's consciousness. Although shaken to his core, Johnnie finds the answers he needs. Most importantly, he survives the flood and can finally move forward.\n\n\nAnita Gates of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"an interesting and adeptly made drama\" but thought \"its message is unclear.\"\n\nAlthough Glenn Lovell of \"Variety\" called the film a \"bracing, beautifully shot upstart drama,\" he observed, \"It's a safe bet ... [it] won't win over the \"Far and Away\" date crowd.\"\n"}

It is a cotton or nylon web apparatus that looks like two suspended ribbons. By wrapping the strap ends around hands and wrists, the performer performs holds, twists, rolls and manoeuvres, requiring extreme strength and precision similar men’s rings in gymnastics. Straps are available in various configurations, including those with various types of loops at the ends and those without loops. A straps act usually includes held poses and postures done on the straps, dance moves performed on the floor away from the straps, partner acrobatics done on and off the straps, as well as having the straps pulled up and let down during the act.\n\nThe discipline of aerial straps was originally a Chinese specialty where athletes would perform intensely muscular tricks up and down the straps. Many of the moves are similar to those of the Aerial Rings. \nThe pioneers of contemporary aerial straps were identical twins Yuri and Valery Panteleenko, known as the Panteleenko Brothers. The brothers started their performance careers as part of a Russian illusionist’s magic show. During a show in Rostov-On-Don in 1969, Vladivien Levshin, the Rubanov Company’s acrobatic coach saw their athleticism and potential and began training them to perform what was to become a milestone act in the history of this apparatus. Previously, a straps routine would be performed from a static position, only moving up and down the straps. Levshin introduced swinging, circular, and two-person moves. These new elements, not to mention the brothers’ elegance and resemblance added a new level of grace and beauty to the balletic nature of the apparatus.\nIn 1972 the brothers debuted the act; by 1973 they had already won the U.S.S.R.’s All-Union Circus Competition, at that time considered to be the world’s most difficult circus competition. They subsequently began touring with the Moscow State Circus.\n\nIn 1983 the brothers performed at the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo but were largely ignored by the judges, receiving only the City of Monaco prize. It wasn’t until the early 1990s that the Panteleenko brothers’ style of performance gained wider acceptance. Today nearly all straps routines bear the mark of their original routine.\n\nIn 1989 Yuri died of a heart attack after a show. Despite this, Valery decided to continue on the Panteleenko Brothers act, taking on Igor Gruzen as Yuri’s replacement. They performed until 1995 when Valery retired from performing at the age of 50 to become Head Rigger for \"Barnum's Kaleidoscape\", eventually retiring to Florida. Valery died of cancer in January 2006 but was succeeded by his son Maxime, who is still performing.\n"}

The screenplay was written by Luhrmann and screenwriter Stuart Beattie, with Ronald Harwood and Richard Flanagan. The film is a character story, set between 1939 and 1942 against a dramatised backdrop of events across northern Australia at the time, such as the bombing of Darwin during World War II.\n\nProduction took place in Sydney, Darwin, Kununurra and Bowen. The film was released to cinemas on 26 November 2008 in the United States and in Australia on 26 December 2008, with subsequent worldwide release dates throughout late December 2008 and January and February 2009. \"Australia\" received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $211 million on a $130 million budget. It is the third highest grossing Australian film of all time, behind \"Crocodile Dundee\" (1986) and \"\" (2015).\n\nIn 1939, Lady Sarah Ashley travels from England to northern Australia to force her philandering husband to sell his faltering cattle station, Faraway Downs. Her husband sends an independent cattle drover, called \"Drover\", to transport her to Faraway Downs.\n\nLady Sarah's husband is murdered shortly before she arrives, and the authorities tell her that the killer is an Aboriginal elder, \"King George\". Meanwhile, cattle station manager Neil Fletcher is trying to gain control of Faraway Downs, so that Lesley 'King' Carney will have a complete cattle monopoly, giving him negotiating leverage with an Australian army officer, Captain Dutton, who wants to buy the cattle.\n\nThe childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the boy Nullah, who has an Aboriginal mother and a white father. Nullah tells her that he has seen her cattle being driven onto Carney's land — in other words, stolen from her. Because of this Fletcher mistreats Nullah and threatens him and his mother, so Lady Sarah fires Fletcher and decides to try to run the cattle station herself. When Nullah and his mother hide from the authorities in a water tower, his mother drowns. Lady Sarah comforts Nullah by singing the song \"Over the Rainbow\" from the film \"The Wizard of Oz\". Nullah tells her that \"King George\" is his grandfather, and that like the Wizard, he too is a \"magic man\".\n\nLady Sarah persuades Drover to take the cattle to Darwin for sale. Drover is friendly with the Aboriginals, and therefore shunned by many of the other whites in the territory. It is revealed that he was married to an Aboriginal woman, who died after being refused medical treatment in a hospital because of her race. Lady Sarah also reveals she is unable to have children.\n\nDrover leads a team of six other riders, including Lady Sarah, Drover's Aboriginal brother-in-law Magarri, Nullah, and the station's accountant Kipling Flynn, to drive the 1,500 cattle to Darwin. They encounter various obstacles along the way, including a fire set by Carney's men that scares the cattle, resulting in the death of Flynn when the group tries to stop the cattle from stampeding over a cliff. Lady Sarah and Drover fall in love, and she gains a new appreciation for the Australian territory. The team drive the cattle through the dangerous Never Never desert. Then, when at last delivering the cattle in Darwin, the group has to race them onto the ship before Carney's cattle are loaded.\n\nAfterwards, Lady Sarah, Nullah, and Drover live together happily at Faraway Downs for two years. Meanwhile, Fletcher kills Carney, marries his daughter Cath Carney, takes over Carney's cattle empire, and continues to menace Lady Sarah. It is established that Fletcher was the actual murderer of Lady Sarah's husband, and is also Nullah's father.\n\nNullah is drawn to go on a walkabout (a rite of passage) with his grandfather \"King George\", but is instead taken by the authorities and sent to live on Mission Island (a fictitious island, but inspired by Bathurst Island) with the other half-Aboriginal children (dubbed the \"Stolen Generations\"). Lady Sarah, who has come to regard Nullah as her adopted son, vows to rescue him. Meanwhile, she works as a radio operator in Darwin during the escalation of World War II. When the Japanese attack the island and Darwin in 1942, Lady Sarah fears that Nullah has been killed.\n\nDrover, who had quarrelled with Lady Sarah and left, returns to Darwin and hears (mistakenly) that she has been killed in the bombing. Drover learns of Nullah's abduction to Mission Island, and goes with Magarri and a young priest to rescue him and the other children. Magarri is killed by Japanese soldiers during the rescue. Meanwhile, Lady Sarah is about to be evacuated, but when Drover and the children sail back into port at Darwin, and Nullah plays \"Over the Rainbow\" on his harmonica, Lady Sarah hears the music and the three are reunited.\n\nFletcher, distraught at the ruination of his plans and at the death of his wife killed during a Japanese air strike, attempts to shoot Nullah, but is speared by King George and falls dead. Lady Sarah, Drover, and Nullah return to the safety of remote Faraway Downs. There, King George calls for Nullah, who returns to the Outback with his grandfather.\n\nOriginally, Baz Luhrmann was planning to make a film about Alexander the Great starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman, with a screenplay by David Hare. The director had built a studio in the northern Sahara but \"Alexander\" made by Oliver Stone was released first and after several years in development, Luhrmann abandoned the project to make a film closer to home. The visual effects were done by the Animal Logic films and The LaB Sydney. Luhrmann spent six months researching general Australian history. At one point he considered setting his film during the First Fleet, 11 ships that sailed from Britain in 1787 and set up the first colony in New South Wales. The director wanted to explore Australia's relationship with England and with its indigenous population. He decided to set the film between World Wars I and II in order to merge a historical romance with the Stolen Generations, where thousands of mixed-race Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their families by the state and integrated into white society. Luhrmann has said that his film depicts \"a mythologised Australia\".\n\nIn May 2005, Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman entered negotiations to star in an untitled 20th Century Fox project written by director Baz Luhrmann and screenwriter Stuart Beattie, with Luhrmann directing the film. For her role, Kidman learned to round up cattle. In May 2006, due to Crowe's demanding personal script approval before signing onto the project, Luhrmann sought to replace the actor with Heath Ledger. Crowe said he didn't want to work in an environment that was influenced by budgetary needs. About this casting issue, Luhrmann said, \"it was hard pinning [Crowe] down. Every time I was ready, Russell was in something else, and every time he was ready, I would be having another turmoil\". The following June, Luhrmann replaced Crowe with actor Hugh Jackman. In January 2007, actors Bryan Brown, Jack Thompson, and David Wenham were cast into \"Australia\". In November 2006, Luhrmann began searching for an actor to play an Aboriginal boy of 8–10 years old and by April 2007, 11-year-old Brandon Walters was cast into the role of Nullah. Academic D. Bruno Starrs has written about how this casting choice and the decision to have the character of Nullah narrate the film reinforce its \"left-leaning\" message regarding the 'Stolen Generations'.\n\nThe untitled project was scheduled to begin production in September 2006, but scheduling conflicts and budget issues postponed the start of production to February 2007. In November 2006, Luhrmann explored The Kimberley to determine the amount of production to be shot there. In December 2006, Bowen was chosen as a filming location for a third of the production, portraying the look of Darwin. Bowen was chosen as a prospect due to the financing of $500,000 by the Queensland government. In April, Kununurra was chosen as another location for \"Australia\", this time to serve as Faraway Downs, the homestead owned by Kidman's character. Entire sets were built from scratch, including a stand-alone set in the Queensland town of Bowen, the re-creation of war scenes near Darwin Harbour, and the construction of an outback homestead in Western Australia.\n\nAcademy Award-winning costume designer Catherine Martin did extensive research for the film's outfits, studying archival images and newspapers from the 1930s and 1940s Australia. She also interviewed descendants of the original Darwin stockmen in order to find out if they \"wore socks with his boots when he rode a horse, that's something you either get through a snapshot, or something you have to go talk to the people who lived there about\". The Asian-inspired costumes of the film were intended to evoke the romanticism of the era, and one of the centrepieces of the film's costuming is a red chrysanthemum-printed Chinese cheongsam or qipao that was made for Nicole Kidman's character. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design.\n\nThe director planned to begin filming in March 2007. However, principal photography began on 30 April 2007 in Sydney, and Kidman found out that she was pregnant. She instantly withdrew from her next film, \"The Reader\". Afterwards, the production moved to Bowen on 14 May. Filming in Kununurra was a gruelling experience for the cast and crew with temperatures soaring to which, one day, caused Kidman to faint while on a horse. In addition, she worked 14- and 15-hour days while dealing with morning sickness. While shooting in a remote region of Western Australia, the shoot had to be rescheduled when the Faraway Downs set, the homestead central to the film's story, was reduced to mud from torrential rain – the first in 50 years. The cast and crew went back to Sydney to shoot interior scenes until the expensive set dried out. In addition, at one point, the entire country's horses were in lock down over equine flu. Scenes using Darwin harbour were shot in July 2007, with parts of Stokes Hill Wharf blocked to the public and mini buses used to ferry tourists past the film set. Filming lasted five months, wrapping up at Fox Studios, Sydney, on 19 December 2007. In late April, Luhrmann titled his project \"Australia\". Two other titles that he considered for the film had been \"Great Southern Land\" and \"Faraway Downs\". On 11 August 2008, eight months after filming wrapped, several members of the cast and crew were back at Fox Studios, Sydney, to film pick up shots.\n\nTwo weeks before the film's premiere, the \"Daily Telegraph\" erroneously reported that Luhrmann gave in to studio pressure after \"intense\" talks with executives and re-wrote and then re-shot the ending of \"Australia\" for a happier conclusion after \"disastrous reviews\" from test screenings. To counter these negative reports, the studio had Jackman and Kidman promoting \"Australia\" on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", which dedicated an entire episode of the program to the film, and Fox Co-Chairman Tom Rothman spoke to the \"Los Angeles Times\" where he described the \"Telegraph\" article as \"patently nonsensical. It's all too typical of the way the world works today that everybody picked up an unsourced, anonymous quote-filled story in a tabloid from Sydney and nobody ever bothered to check to see if it was accurate\". Rothman also said that Luhrmann had final cut on his film. The director admitted that he wrote six endings in the drafts he authored, and shot three of them.\n\nDavid Hirschfelder composed the score to \"Australia\". Interpolated musical numbers include the jazz standards \"Begin the Beguine\", \"Tuxedo Junction\", \"Sing Sing Sing (With a Swing)\", and \"Brazil\". Edward Elgar's \"Nimrod\" from \"Enigma\" Variations is heard in the final scene of the film. Luhrmann hired singer Rolf Harris to record his wobble board for the opening credits, and Elton John composed and performed a song called \"The Drover's Ballad\", to lyrics by Luhrmann, for the end credits. Also used in the end credits is \"By the Boab Tree\", a song nominated for a 2008 Satellite Award, again with Luhrmann lyrics, performed by Sydney singer Angela Little. Little's rendition of \"Waltzing Matilda\" completes the end credits in some versions of the film. The jazz sound track to \"Australia\" was performed by the Ralph Pyle big band with clarinet solos by Andy Firth.\n\nTourism Western Australia spent $1 million on a campaign linked with the release of \"Australia\" in the United States, Canada, Japan, Europe and South Korea that ties in with an international Tourism Australia plan. Concerned about the recession and fluctuating international fuel prices, the tourism industry hoped that Luhrmann's film would deliver visitors from all over the world in the same kind of numbers that came to the country following the 1986 release of \"Crocodile Dundee\", and follow the significant increase in visitors to New Zealand since 2001 after the release of \"The Lord of the Rings\" films. Federal Tourism Minister Martin Ferguson said, \"This movie will potentially be seen by tens of millions of people, and it will bring life to little-known aspects of Australia's extraordinary natural environment, history and indigenous culture\". Tourism Australia worked with Luhrmann and 20th Century Fox on a publicity campaign titled, \"See the Movie, See the Country\", based on movie maps and location guides, to transform the film into \"a real-life travel adventure\". In addition, the director made a $50 million series of commercials promoting the country.\n\n\"Australia\" received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 56% based on 211 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Built on lavish vistas and impeccable production, \"Australia\" is unfortunately burdened with thinly drawn characters and a lack of originality.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nJim Schembri in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" and \"The Age\" (Melbourne) wrote, \"The film is fine, and never boring but, boy, is it overlong,\" and added, \"More importantly, local films with black themes or major indigenous characters tend to do poorly, so if \"Australia\" succeeds here it could represent a breakthrough. We've always had trouble dealing with racial issues on film, so, in that regard, the film could be a landmark.\" Claire Sutherland, in her review for the \"Herald Sun\" (Melbourne) wrote, \"A love letter to the Australian landscape and our history, \"Australia\" has international blockbuster written all over it\", and Sydney's \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote, \"Kidman's screen presence is nothing short of radiant.\" In his review for \"The Australian\" (Sydney), David Stratton wrote, \"It's not the masterpiece that we were hoping for, but I think you could say that it's a very good film in many ways. While it will be very popular with many people I think there's a slight air of disappointment after it all. Despite its flaws — and it certainly has flaws — I think \"Australia\" is an impressive and important film.\" Mark Naglazas of \"The West Australian\" (Perth) accused positive reviews from News Ltd press outlets of being manipulated by 20th Century Fox, as they are all owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, calling \"Australia\" a film of \"unrelenting awfulness\" that \"lurches drunkenly from crazy comedy to Mills and Boonish melodrama in the space of a couple of scenes\".\n\nChris Tookey, in his review for the \"Daily Mail\" (London) wrote, \"Kidman and Jackman have great sexual chemistry, as well as the glamour of Forties cinema idols.\" He also rated the film the maximum five stars. The \"News of the World\" (London) followed suit by rating the film with five stars, the reviewer Robie Collin praised the casting and camerawork; \"The jaw-dropping, picture postcard camerawork, that will have your eyes scouring each scene for every last delicious detail. The uproarious comic interludes (Nicole’s rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow, and the build-up to it, is one of the best-played comic set pieces of the year). The magnetic and irksomely handsome Hugh Jackman, the undisputed star of the show.\" Anne Barrowclough of \"The Times\" (London) gave the film four out of five stars, and states the film defies expectation and \"in what turns out to be a multi-layered story it describes an Australia of the 1940s that is at once compellingly beautiful and breathtakingly cruel\". Bonnie Malkin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" (London) stated: \"Local critics had worried that the much-anticipated film \"Australia\" would present to the world a series of time-honoured Antipodean clichés. Their fears were well founded\".\n\nMegan Lehmann, writing in \"The Hollywood Reporter\", said that the film \"defies all but the most cynical not to get carried away by the force of its grandiose imagery and storytelling\", and it is \"much less earnest than the trailer suggests, layered with a thin veneer of camp and a nod and a wink to accompany the requisite Aussie clichés\", and the bottom line is \"In epic style, Baz Luhrmann weaves his wizardry on Oz\". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting \"Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian \"Gone with the Wind\", and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism\". David Ansen, in his review for \"Newsweek\", wrote, \"Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman is delicious. In a solemn season, \"Australia\"'s bold, kitschy, unapologetic artifice is a welcome respite\". In her review for \"The New York Times\", Manohla Dargis wrote, \"this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion\". Andrew Sarris, in his review for the \"New York Observer\", wrote, \"\"Australia\" is clearly a labor of love, and a matter of national pride. It is also a bit of a mess. I must confess that I might have been harder on Mr Luhrmann's film if I had not remained entranced by Ms Kidman ever since I first saw her in Phillip Noyce's \"Dead Calm\" in 1989; in my opinion, she has lost none of her luster in the 20 years since\". In his review for \"Time\", Richard Schickel wrote, \"Have you seen everything \"Australia\" has on offer a dozen times before? Sure you have. It's a movie less created by director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann than assembled, Dr Frankenstein-style, from the leftover body parts of earlier movies. Which leaves us asking this question: How come it is so damnably entertaining?\" Joe Morgenstern of \"The Wall Street Journal\", opines that, \"in its heart of hearts \"Australia\" is an old-fashioned Western - a Northern, if you will - and all the more enjoyable for it.\" Nick Rogers, of FilmYap, adds that, \"Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns — dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves.\" Ann Hornaday, in her review for \"The Washington Post\", wrote, \"A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and revisionism, \"Australia\" is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining\". In her review for Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, \"The second half of \"Australia\", Luhrmann's attempt to pull off a wartime weeper, is so aggressively sentimental that it begins to feel more like punishment than pleasure. I left \"Australia\" feeling drained and weakened, as if I'd suffered a gradual poisoning at the hands of a mad scientist\".\n\nThe film had better box office success in overseas markets and a disappointing gross in the United States — a pattern similar to Luhrmann's three previous films. , the film has grossed $211,342,221 in its worldwide releases. In Australia, the film grossed A$6.37 million in its opening weekend, setting the record for the highest grossing opening weekend for an Australian film and bumping the latest James Bond film \"Quantum of Solace\" to second place. \"Australia\" performed less well in the U.S., where it surprised box office analysts by opening only at #5, behind \"Quantum of Solace\", \"Twilight\", \"Bolt\", and \"Four Christmases\", and grossed $20 million opening weekend. However, Fox officials were reportedly happy with the numbers, as they said they were expecting only an $18 million opening gross for the film. They further pointed out that Baz Luhrmann's other films, like \"Moulin Rouge!\", \"Strictly Ballroom\", and \"Romeo + Juliet\", started slowly and then built momentum. \"Australia\" eventually grossed $49,554,002 in the U.S., 23.4% of its total worldwide gross.\"Australia's\" ticket sales outside the United States are $161,788,219 from 51 countries.

It is run by the BBC World Service and funded from the British television licence fee.\n\nIn 1994, BBC Arabic Television was launched by Rome-based Orbit Communications Company (owned by King Fahd's cousin, Prince Khalid ibn Abdullah) and a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabian Mawarid Holding. On 21 April 1996, it was \"pulled off the air\" following an episode of \"Panorama\" that was critical of the Saudi Arabian government. Ian Richardson, who set up the news department during that time blamed the short life of the channel on a clash with the owners over content.\nDuring the short life of BBC Arabic Television, there were several angry ‘liaison meetings’ with Orbit and the guarantees of editorial independence proved to be a sour joke, only barely obscured by a thin smokescreen about the BBC's alleged failure to observe \"cultural sensitivities\" – Saudi code for anything not to the Royal Family's liking. When it became clear to Orbit and Mawarid that it had, in their terms, created a monster not prepared to toe the Saudi line, it was only a matter of time before there would be a final parting of the ways.\n\nMany of the staff who worked for the original BBC Arabic Television service went on to work for Al Jazeera television, now one of BBC Arabic Television's main competitors.\n\nPlans to relaunch the channel were announced in October 2005 and broadcasting was to start in Autumn 2007, but was delayed until 0956 GMT on 11 March 2008.\n\nTony Khouri, Malak Jaafar\n\nBBC Arabic Television is run by the BBC World Service. Initially it was funded from a grant-in-aid from the British Foreign Office but in 2014 funding was switched to come from the television licence that is mainly used to fund the BBC's domestic broadcasting. The service is based in the Peel Wing of Broadcasting House in London. 24-hour programming began 19 January 2009.\n\nIn 2011, as the British government cut funding to the BBC, forcing the BBC World Service to close down its services in five languages, the government simultaneously increased funding to the BBC Arabic service, in the words of Foreign Secretary William Hague, to \"assist the BBC Arabic Service to continue their valuable work in the region\".\n\nBBC Arabic can also be seen via bbc.co.uk/Arabic/. The website includes a 16:9 live stream of the channel.\n\n\"Newshour\", an hour-long news bulletin is broadcast twice a day. In this programme, the top stories of the day are analysed and covered by BBC correspondents around the world. Other bulletins are half-an-hour long. The top stories are broadcast on the channel every fifteen minutes.\n\n"}

{"id": "312120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312120", "title": "BatMUD", "text": "BatMUD\n\nBatMUD is a medieval fantasy MUD, established in 1990. \"BatMUD\" is Finland-based and operated and owned by a non-profit organization, Balanced Alternative Techniques ry (\"B.A.T. ry\"), officially registered 1994 in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nBy 2006, over 100,000 players had frequented the game, making it one of the largest text-based multiplayer games on the Internet. In the beginning of 2008, it had over 30,000 subscriptions. At the end of 2011, amount of subscriptions was similarly over 30,000 giving BatMUD a flat growth (amount of new players equal those who no longer frequent the game). It has been called a \"very popular and complex game\".\n\n\"BatMUD\" was one of the first LPMuds and has been online with only a few, if any minor breaks since 14 April 1990.\nThe game was initially set-up by a wizard who named himself Jaf, followed by many volunteer coders, all becoming wizards in the process.\nThe MUD's name comes from the name of the server the game was first hosted on, batman.cs.hut.fi. Since then, BatMUD has relocated several times, at one point residing in Oulu, Finland.\nAs of November 2007, the main \"BatMUD\" servers are co-located in the two data centers of Nebula in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nDespite its phenomenal age as an Internet community, the MUD is constantly evolving which makes it both challenging and entertaining to new and old players alike.\nDue to the rich set of features, \"BatMUD\" may be a bit overwhelming for a newcomer.\n\nIn September 1994, the organization Balanced Alternative Techniques ry was officially registered in the \"Joint corporate information system of the National Board of Patents and Registration and the Tax Administration\" of Finland.\nThe game was also previewed in Pelit-magazine and was highly praised from its rich set of features while scoring over 90/100 points.\n\nThrough the years, \"BatMUD\" has also been voted \"Game of the month\" by several Internet gaming-sites, such as MPOGD.com in April, 2003.\n\nIn 2004, B.A.T. ry applied for the \"BatMUD\" trademark and \"BatMUD\" was registered as a trademark by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on April 5, 2005.\nAlso, a 91-page Pro graduation thesis emerges from the University of Lapland, themed \"Artificial Intelligence in text-based computer games' dramaturgy.\nStudy subjects: Nethack and BatMUD\", Audiovisual Mediaculture written by Jussi Huhtala (in Finnish).\n\nIn February 2007, a 100-page Pro graduation master's thesis with the topic \"Virtual gift - Trading gifts in BatMUD virtual community\" in cultural anthropology for the University of Jyväskylä was published, written by a non-player in Finnish.\n\n\"BatMUD\" has a wide variety of races. Player killing is lightly moderated.\n\nIt is arguable that \"BatMUD\" formed one of the earliest virtual communities of gamers on the Internet.\nWhat marks the community significant, is the active operation and participation of the individuals within the virtual community. Several conventions and events are being held across the world, with one of the most notable probably being the Indiana, U.S. based Campcon, being held for the 11th consecutive year in June, 2009 — a real life gathering of active participants of the \"BatMUD\" community. Similar events are held in Europe and Scandinavia every year.\n\n\"BatMUD\" provides a range of interplayer communication methods, allowing the players to talk and chat. Though the majority (about 2/3) of the players reside in Finland, the game itself is wholly in English, enabling it to host a large player base from several countries, including many European countries, the United States, Canada and Australia. Together with roleplay not being strictly enforced, the common language of English allows debates to flourish.\n\nWith about one hundred players simultaneously online, it is also one of the largest traditional MUDs. However, with the rise of massively multiplayer online games its popularity has fallen off in recent years with fewer new players joining. Aggressive efforts have been made to make the MUD more newbie friendly but most players continue to be well established players who have invested months or years into the game. As with many other popular online games, addiction is not unknown.\n\n\"BatMUD\" employs a virtual economy, with players selling rare items and favours to each other in the game's internal currency. Sale of characters or equipment for real life money is forbidden. If it has occurred, it has not been a major problem.\n\n\"BatMUD\" was the first MUD played by Matt \"Sarapis\" Mihaly, founder of Iron Realms Entertainment. Mihaly became a wizard on \"BatMUD\", but was banned for making a room that trapped and disabled other wizards.\n"}
{"id": "18340621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18340621", "title": "BattleForge", "text": "BattleForge\n\nBattleForge is a discontinued video game that was developed by EA Phenomic and published by Electronic Arts in 2009. \"BattleForge\" is an online card-based real-time strategy (RTS) game. The game's servers were shut down on October 31, 2013.\n\nBattleforge was developed by EA Phenomic and published Electronic Arts. It was released on Windows in March 2009 along with a demo.\nOn May 26, 2009, \"BattleForge\" became a Play 4 Free game.\n\nOn September 4, 2013, EA announced the closing of the game in an email to registered players, effective October 31, 2013.\n\nIn June 2015, a group started work on reverse engineering the game code to create a server for the game (Server emulator), called \"Skylords Reborn\". The final game is planned to be free-to-play, like the original, but without micro-transactions. The server maintenance is planned to be funded by donations. As of the beginning of 2017 the development is in closed beta testing, and open stress tests began in September 2018.\n\nOn its initial release, the game revolved around trading, buying and winning through means of micro-transactions, though micro-transactions were not required for playing the game, only for buying new cards. When \"BattleForge\" became a Play 4 Free branded game with fewer cards initially available (32 cards and no points). The retail version came with all of the starter decks (One for each element, 64 cards) and 3,000 \"BattleForge\" points. The game's virtual currency was distributed to each player on a 2-point per day basis. Requirement was that the player has played at least 15 minutes that day. Through this, all micro-transactions were available to all players, but doing them without purchasing the retail version of the game or any virtual currency was possible, only slow.\n\nThere were a total of 383 cards available, almost equally divided between the powers of fire, frost, nature, and shadow. After an update, combinations of shadow/fire, frost/nature, frost/shadow and fire/nature were introduced, as well as legendary cards. Players could buy and sell cards at an in-game auction house, using BattleForge Points (BF Points), an in-game currency. Players could also invite each other to conduct a direct trade.\n\nThere was a PvE mode (player versus environment) and a PvP mode (player versus player). In the PvE mode, players could complete missions. Some of these missions could only be played by 1 player, while others could be played with 2, 4 or 12 players. There were three modes available in missions: standard, advanced and expert. In order to unlock advanced and expert modes, players would have to complete the series of missions on standard mode first. The rewards for the missions were gold, card upgrades and PvE experience points. These experience points would increase a player's PvE level.\n\nFor PvP, players could choose between ranked and unranked PvP. Unranked PvP would not give any rewards, but could be useful for testing cards and strategies or for a simple, friendly match. Ranked pvp would give players gold, Elo points and tokens as reward. Gold and tokens could be traded for card upgrades, while ELO points would increase a player's PvP level.\n\nBattleForge supported DirectX 11's hardware tessellation feature on PC systems with DirectX 11 installed, which was subject to operating system and graphics card compatibility.\n\nThe Twilight edition was the first edition of \"BattleForge\" cards. Twilight edition of cards contained a total of two-hundred (200) unique cards, including fifty cards for each elemental faction: Fire, Frost, Nature, and Shadow. Each of these powers had its own special abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Each power was represented by an orb color in the game. The Twilight Edition consisted of 200 cards in total, i.e. 50 units, buildings and spells for each of these powers.\n\nThe Renegade Edition was the second edition of \"BattleForge\" cards. It expanded the \"BattleForge\" card set with legendary units and monumental buildings from the Southern Wastes region of Nyn. 60 new units and buildings were added to the \"BattleForge\" card pool.\n\nThe Lost Souls Edition was released on February 9, 2010 with a total of 60 brand new and unique units.\n\nThe Amii Edition was released in small proportions in each patch. About 4 cards got released in almost each patch. When the Amii Edition was fully released on April 26, 2012 the last 2 cards where added, bringing a total of 32 new cards to the game. The Amii Edition was the smallest edition but took the longest time to be released, using Sneak Preview Decks for 2 years prior to the actual release.\n"}

{"id": "5415565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5415565", "title": "Club Penguin", "text": "Club Penguin\n\nClub Penguin was a massively multiplayer online game (MMO), involving a virtual world that contained a range of online games and activities. It was created by New Horizon Interactive (now known as Disney Canada Inc.). Players used cartoon penguin-avatars and played in a winter-set virtual world. After beta-testing, \"Club Penguin\" was made available to the general public on October 24, 2005, and expanded into a large online community, such that by late 2007, it was claimed \"Club Penguin\" had over 30 million user accounts. As of July 2013, \"Club Penguin\" had over 200 million registered user accounts.\n\nWhile free memberships were available, revenue was predominantly raised through paid memberships, which allowed players to access a range of additional features, such as the ability to purchase virtual clothing, furniture, and in-game pets called \"puffles\" for their penguins through the usage of in-game currency. The success of \"Club Penguin\" led to New Horizon being purchased by The Walt Disney Company in August 2007 for the sum of 350 million dollars, with an additional 350 million dollars in bonuses should specific targets be met by 2009.\n\nThe game was specifically designed for children aged 6 to 14 (however, users of any age were allowed to play \"Club Penguin\"). Thus, a major focus of the developers was on child safety, with a number of features having been introduced to the game to facilitate this. These features included offering an \"Ultimate Safe Chat\" mode, whereby users selected their comments from a menu; filtering that prevented swearing and the revelation of personal information; and moderators who patrolled the game.\n\nOn January 30, 2017, it was announced that the game would be discontinued on March 29, 2017. \"Club Penguin\" later shut down its servers on March 30, 2017 at 12:01 AM. The game was replaced by a successor, titled \"Club Penguin Island\". The original game has since been recreated on a number of private servers using SWF files from Club Penguin. The two most popular ones, CPPS.me and Club Penguin Rewritten, have reached over two million players.\n\nThe first seeds of what would become \"Club Penguin\" began as a Flash 4 web-based game called \"Snow Blasters\" that developer Lance Priebe had been developing in his spare time in July 2000. Priebe's attention was brought to penguins after he \"happened to glance at a \"Far Side\" cartoon featuring penguins that was sitting on his desk\". The project was never finished, and instead morphed into \"Experimental Penguins. Experimental Penguins\" was released through Priebe's company of employment, the Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada-based online game and comic developer Rocketsnail Games, in July 2000, though it ultimately went offline the following year. It was used as the inspiration for \"Penguin Chat\" (also known as \"Penguin Chat 1\"), a similar game which was released shortly after \"Experimental Penguins\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> removal. Released January 2003, \"Penguin Football Chat\" (also known as \"Penguin Chat 2)\" was the second attempt at a penguin-themed MMORPG, and was created on FLASH 5 and used the same interface as \"Experimental Penguins.\" The game contained various minigames; the premiere title of RocketSnail Games was \"Ballistic Biscuit\", a game that would be placed into \"Experimental Penguins\" and eventually be adapted into \"Club Penguin\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Hydro Hopper\". RocketSnails Games' \"Mancala Classic\" would also be placed into the game as \"Mancala\".\n\nLance Priebe, as well as co-workers Lane Merrifield and Dave Krysko, started to formulate the \"Club Penguin\" concept when the trio were unsuccessful in finding \"something that had some social components but was safe, and not just marketed as safe\" for their own children. Dave Krysko in particular wanted to build a safe social-networking site their kids could enjoy free of advertising. In 2003, Merrifield and Priebe approached their boss, with the idea of creating a spinoff company to develop the new product. The spin-off company would be known as New Horizon Interactive.\n\nWork commenced on the project in 2004, and the team settled on a name in the summer of 2005. The developers used the previous project \"Penguin Chat 2\" – which was still online – as a jumping-off point in the design process, while incorporating concepts and ideas from Experimental Penguins. Penguin Chat's third version was released in April 2005, and was used to test the client and servers of \"Penguin Chat 4\" (renamed \"Club Penguin\"). Variants of \"Penguin Chat 3\" included \"Crab Chat, Chibi Friends Chat, Goat Chat, Ultra-Chat, and TV Chat.\" Users from Penguin Chat were invited to beta test \"Club Penguin\". The original plan was to release \"Club Penguin\" in 2010, but since the team had decided to fast-track the project, the first version of \"Club Penguin\" went live on October 24, 2005, just after Penguin Chat servers were shut down in August 2005. While Penguin Chat used ElectroServer, \"Club Penguin\" would use SmartFoxServer. The developers financed their start-up entirely with their own credit cards and personal lines of credit, and maintained 100 percent ownership. \"Club Penguin\" started with 15,000 users, and by March that number had reached 1.4 million—a figure which almost doubled by September, when it hit 2.6 million. By the time \"Club Penguin\" was two years old, it had reached 3.9 million users, despite lacking a marketing budget. The first mention of the game in The New York Times was in October 2006. The following year, \"Club Penguin\" spokesperson Karen Mason explained: \"We offer children the training wheels for the kinds of activities they might pursue as they get older.\"\n\nAlthough the three \"Club Penguin\" co-creators had turned down lucrative advertising offers and venture capital investments in the past, in August 2007, they agreed to sell both \"Club Penguin\" and its parent company to Disney for the sum of $350.93 million. In addition, the owners were promised bonuses of up to $350 million if they were able to meet growth targets by 2009. Disney ultimately didn't pay the extra $350 million, as \"Club Penguin\" missed both profit goals. At the point when it was purchased by Disney, \"Club Penguin\" had 11–12 million accounts, of which 700,000 were paid subscribers, and was generating $40 million in annual revenue. In making the sale, Merrifield has stated that their main focus during negotiations was philosophical, and that the intent was to provide themselves with the needed infrastructure in order to continue to grow. By late 2007, it was claimed that \"Club Penguin\" had over 30 million user accounts. In December of that year, The New York Times asserted that the game \"attracts seven times more traffic than Second Life\". \"Club Penguin\" was the 8th top social networking site in April 2008, according to Nielsen.\n\nAfter Disney's acquisition, Disney Interactive had four MMOs to simultaneously juggle: \"ToonTown\", \"Pirates of the Caribbean Online\", \"Pixie Hollow\", and \"Club Penguin\", with \"World of Cars\" set to follow soon. Lane Merrifield assured GlobalToyNews at the time that \"it's a lot of worlds to manage, but we have really strong teams.\" Merrifield's role changed from taking a backseat in daily game design to focusing on overall branding and quality control of the virtual gaming properties. One of his roles was to merge the \"Club Penguin\" studio New Horizon Interactive in Kelowna (renamed to Disneyland Studios Canada) with Disneyland Studios LA). Disneyland Studios Canada focused its efforts on one product (with such features as multilingual versions), while Disneyland Studios LA focused on customer products and franchises of a wide selection of games. Merrifield was responsible for cross-pollinating both cultures.\n\nSince the Disney purchase, \"Club Penguin\" continued to grow, becoming part of a larger franchise including video games, books, a television special, an anniversary song, and an app MMO. Disney has often used the game as a cross-promotion opportunity when releasing new films such as \"Frozen,\" \"Zootopia,\" and \"Star Wars,\" having special themed events and parties to celebrate their releases. The game forged an ever-growing mythology of characters and plot elements, including: a pirate, a journalist, and a secret agent.\n\nIn 2008, the first international office opened in Brighton, England, to personalise the level of moderation and player support. Later international office locations included São Paulo and Buenos Aires. On March 11, 2008, \"Club Penguin\" released the \"Club Penguin\" Improvement Project. This project allowed players to be part of the testing of new servers, which were put into use in \"Club Penguin\" on April 14, 2008. Players had a \"clone\" of their penguin made, to test these new servers for bugs and glitches. The testing was ended on April 4, 2008.\n\nOn June 20, 2011, the game's website temporarily crashed after the company let the \"Club Penguin\" domain name expire. In September 2011, one of Club Penguin's minigames, Puffle Launch, was released on iOS as an app. Merrifield commented: \"Kids are going mobile and have been asking for Club Penguin to go there with them.\"\n\nIn late 2012, Merrifield left Disney Interactive to focus on his family and a new educational product, Freshgrade. Chris Heatherly took Merrifield's former position. The company dropped the words \"Online Studios\" from its name in 2013. As of July 2013, \"Club Penguin\" had over 200 million registered user accounts. In 2013, \"Club Penguin\" hired singer and former \"Club Penguin\" player Jordan Fisher to record a song entitled \"It's Your Birthday\", to commemorate Club Penguin's 8th anniversary.\n\nIn April 2015, it was revealed that Disney Interactive had laid off 28 members of \"Club Penguin\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Kelowna headquarters due to the game's declining popularity. The company's UK office in Brighton was shut down around April 17, 2015. Some employees in the Los Angeles office were also let go. Disney Interactive replied to Castanet on the layoffs: \"Disney Interactive continually looks to find ways to create efficiencies and streamline our operations. As part of this ongoing process, we are consolidating a small number of teams and are undergoing a targeted reduction in workforce.\"\n\nOn September 2, 2015, \"Club Penguin\" closed down the German and Russian versions of the site. A spin-off mobile app, Puffle Wild, was removed from the App Store and Google Play the same day in order to allow Disney Interactive to focus on Club Penguin. On January 11, 2016, the Sled Racer and SoundStudio apps (the former being an original game and the latter being a port of a game on the website) followed suit. With the closure of Disney Interactive in 2015, \"Club Penguin\" side-projects wound down to allow a streamlined effort to focus on the core \"Club Penguin\" experience; this involved the layoffs of 30 Disney Studios Canada staff.\n\nOn January 30, 2017, \"Club Penguin\" announced that the current game would be discontinued on March 29, 2017, to make way for its successor, \"Club Penguin Island.\" Membership payments for the original game were no longer accepted as of January 31, 2017, with paid members slated to receive emails about membership and refunds.\n\nIt became popular in the final weeks of Club Penguin to attempt speedruns to see how fast users could get banned from the site; the fastest records were tool-assisted speedruns.\n\nDays before the shut down, \"Club Penguin\" announced that on the final day of the game's operation, all users would be given a free membership until the servers were disconnected.\n\nOn March 30, 2017, at 12:01:39 AM PDT (7:01:39 AM UTC), \"Club Penguin\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s servers were officially shut down.\n\nPrior to being purchased by Disney, \"Club Penguin\" was almost entirely dependent on membership fees to produce a revenue stream. The vast majority of users (90% according to The Washington Post) chose not to pay, instead taking advantage of the free play on offer. Those who chose to pay did so because full (paid) membership was required to access all of the services, such as the ability to purchase virtual clothes for the penguins and buy decorations for igloos, and because peer pressure created a \"caste system,\" separating paid from unpaid members. Advertising, both in-game and on-site, was not incorporated into the system, although some competitors chose to employ it, including: Whyville, which used corporate sponsorship, and Neopets, which incorporated product placements.\n\nAn alternative revenue stream came through the development of an online merchandise shop, which opened on the \"Club Penguin\" website in August 2006, selling stuffed Puffles and T-shirts. Key chains, gift cards, and more shirts were added on November 7, 2006. In October 2008, a series of plush toys based on characters from \"Club Penguin,\" were made available online (both through the \"Club Penguin\" store and Disney's online store), and in retail outlets.\n\nAs with one of its major rivals, \"Webkinz\", \"Club Penguin\" traditionally relied almost entirely on word-of-mouth advertising to increase its membership base.\n\n\"Club Penguin\" was designed for the ages of 6–14. Thus, one of the major concerns when designing \"Club Penguin\" was how to improve both the safety of participants and the suitability of the game to children. As Lane Merrifield stated, \"the decision to build Club Penguin grew out of a desire to create a fun, virtual world that I and the site's other two founders would feel safe letting our own children visit.\" As a result, \"Club Penguin\" maintained a strong focus on child safety, to the point where the security features were described as almost \"fastidious\" and \"reminiscent of an Orwellian dystopia\", although it was also argued that this focus might \"reassure more parents than it alienate[d].\"\n\nThe system employed a number of different approaches in an attempt to improve child safety. The key approaches included preventing the use of inappropriate usernames; providing an \"Ultimate Safe Chat\" mode, which limited players to selecting phrases from a list; using an automatic filter during \"Standard Safe Chat\" (which allowed users to generate their own messages) and blocked profanity even when users employed \"creative\" methods to insert it into sentences; filtering seemingly innocuous terms, such as \"mom\"; and blocking both telephone numbers and email addresses. It also included employing paid moderators; out of 100 staff employed in the company in May 2007, Merrifield estimated that approximately 70 staff were dedicated to policing the game. It also included promoting users to \"EPF (Elite Penguin Force) Agent\" status, and encouraging them to report inappropriate behavior.\n\nEach game server offered a particular type of chat—the majority allowing either chat mode, but some servers allowed only the \"Ultimate Safe Chat\" mode. When using \"Standard Safe Chat\", all comments made by users were filtered. When a comment was blocked, the user who made the comment saw it, but other users were unaware that it was made—suggesting to the \"speaker\" that they were being ignored, rather than encouraging them to try to find a way around the restriction.\n\nBeyond these primary measures, systems were in place to limit the amount of time spent online, and the site did not feature any advertisements, because, as described by Merrifield, \"within two or three clicks, a kid could be on a gambling site or an adult dating site.\" Nevertheless, after \"Club Penguin\" was purchased by Disney, concerns were raised that this state of affairs might change, especially in regard to potential spin-off products—although Disney continued to insist that it believed advertising to be \"inappropriate\" for a young audience.\n\nPlayers who used profanity were often punished by an automatic 24-hour ban, although not all vulgar language resulted in an immediate ban. Players found by moderators to have broken \"Club Penguin\" rules were punished by a ban lasting \"from 24 hours to forever depending on the offense.\"\n\nCoins for Change was an in-game charity fund-raising event which first appeared in 2007. The fund-raising lasted for approximately two weeks each December during the game's annual \"Holiday Party\". Players could \"donate\" their virtual coins to vote for three charitable issues: Kids who were sick, the environment, and kids in developing countries. Players were able to donate in increments of 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 5,000, or 10,000 virtual coins. At the end of the campaign, a set amount of real-world money was divided among each of the causes based on the amount of in-game currency each cause received. At the end of the first campaign, the New Horizon Foundation donated a total of $1 million to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and Free The Children. In both the 2007 and 2008 campaigns, two-and-a-half million players participated. In 2009, \"Club Penguin\" donated $1,000,000 Canadian dollars to charitable projects around the world. In 2010, \"Club Penguin\" donated $300,000 towards building safe places, $360,000 towards protecting the Earth, and $340,000 towards providing medical help. Lane Merrifield said: \"Our players are always looking for ways to make a difference and help others, and over the past five years they've embraced the opportunity to give through Coins For Change, it was exciting to see kids from 191 countries participate together. In 2011, the amount of money donated was doubled to $2 million, ostensibly in response to an unexpected increase in participation.\n\n\"Club Penguin\" was divided into various rooms and distinct areas. Illustrator Chris Hendricks designed many of the first environments. Each player was provided with an igloo for a home. Members had the option of opening their igloo so other penguins could access it via the map, under \"Member Igloos.\" Members could also purchase larger igloos and decorate their igloos with items bought with virtual coins earned by playing mini-games. At least one party per month was held on Club Penguin. In most cases, a free clothing item was available, both for paid members and free users. Some parties also provided member-only rooms which only paid members could access. Some major \"Club Penguin\" parties were its annual Halloween and Holiday parties. Other large parties included the Music Jam, the Adventure Party, the Puffle Party, and the Medieval Party.\n\nDisney's franchising of the brand began with its acquisition of \"Club Penguin\" in 2007. In addition to the \"Club Penguin Island\" web-based video game, the franchise has also included console video games for Nintendo and Wii, television specials in the UK, and a series of books.\n\n\"Club Penguin\" received mixed reviews throughout its journey. The site was awarded a \"kids' privacy seal of approval\" from the Better Business Bureau. Similarly, Brian Ward, a Detective Inspector at the Child Abuse Investigation Command in the United Kingdom, stated that it was good for children to experience a restricted system such as \"Club Penguin\" before moving into social networking sites, which provide less protection. In terms of simple popularity, the rapid growth of \"Club Penguin\" suggested considerable success, although there were signs that this was leveling out. Nielsen figures released in April 2008 indicated that in the previous 12 months, \"Club Penguin\" traffic had shrunk by 7%.\n\nA criticism expressed by commentators was that the game encouraged consumerism and allowed players to cheat. While \"Club Penguin\" did not require members to purchase in-game products with real money (instead relying on a set monthly fee), players were encouraged to earn coins within the game with which to buy virtual products. In addition, the \"competitive culture\" that this could create led to concerns about cheating, as children looked for \"shortcuts\" to improve their standing. It was suggested that this might influence their real-world behavior. To counter this, \"Club Penguin\" added guidelines to prevent cheating, and banned players who were caught cheating or who encouraged cheating. The use of in-game money was commented on as possibly helping teach children how to save money, select what to spend it on, improve their abilities at math, and encourage them to \"practice safe money-management skills\".\n\nIn spite of the attempts to create a safe space for children in \"Club Penguin\", concerns about safety and behavior still arose within the media. While the language in-game was filtered, discussions outside of \"Club Penguin\" were beyond the owner's control, and thus it was stated that third-party \"Club Penguin\" forums could become \"as bawdy as any other chat\". Even within the game, some people noted that cyberbullying could still occur, with flame wars potentially occurring within the game. Also, the \"Caste system\" between those who had membership and exclusive items and those who lacked full membership (and therefore were unable to own the \"coolest\" items) could lead to players having a difficult time attracting friends.\n\nOne criticism came from Caitlin Flanagan in \"The Atlantic Monthly\": in relation to the safety procedures, she noted that \"Club Penguin\" was \"certainly the safest way for unsupervised children to talk to potentially malevolent strangers—but why would you want them to do that in the first place?\" While views of the strength of this criticism might vary, the concern was mirrored by Lynsey Kiely in the \"Sunday Independent\", who quoted Karen Mason, Communications Director for \"Club Penguin\", as saying \"we cannot guarantee that every person who visits the site is a child.\"\n\nOn August 20, 2013, Disney announced that \"Toontown Online\", \"Pixie Hollow\", and \"Pirates of the Caribbean Online\" were closing directly because of \"Club Penguin\" and Disney's mobile games. This caused major controversy between \"Club Penguin\" and fans of the three games, especially \"Toontown\", where some users had played for more than 12 years (\"Toontown\"'s alpha test started in August 2001).\n\nA Club Penguin Private Server (commonly abbreviated and known as a CPPS) is an online multiplayer game that is not part of Club Penguin, but uses SWF files from Club Penguin, a database, and a server emulator in order to create a similar environment for the game. Many now use these environments in order to play the original game after its discontinuation.\n\nCPPSs often contain features that did not exist in the original game such as custom items and rooms, free membership, etc.\n\nThroughout its existence, various players created private servers of Club Penguin. The most popular among these is CPPS.me, a private server launched in 2011 that has since reached over two million players and is available in five languages. In response to the closure of the game, more private servers were created; one of them – Club Penguin Rewritten, launched February 12, 2017 – had reached a million players as of October 12, 2017, though discontinued \"permanently\" on March 4, 2018. Citing community support and funding, it returned in April 2018.\n\nSince private servers essentially copy materials copyrighted by Disney, there has been much controversy as to whether or not creating and hosting them is legal. Disney and Club Penguin often pursue CPPSs and attempt to have them taken down with DMCA notices.\n\nMany private servers have become vulnerable to DDOS attacks and database leaks due to insufficient security measures.\n\n"}

{"id": "35547704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35547704", "title": "God of War: Ascension", "text": "God of War: Ascension\n\nGod of War: Ascension is a third-person action-adventure video game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). The game was first released on March 12, 2013, for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) console. It is the seventh installment in the \"God of War\" series and prequel to the entire series. Loosely based on Greek mythology, the game is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist Kratos, the former servant of the God of War Ares, who tricked Kratos into killing his wife and daughter. In response to this tragedy, Kratos renounced Ares, breaking his blood oath to the god. Kratos was therefore imprisoned and tortured by the three Furies, guardians of honor and enforcers of punishment. Helped by the oath keeper Orkos, Kratos escapes his imprisonment and confronts the Furies to be completely free of his bond to Ares.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to previous installments, focusing on combo-based combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and other weapons acquired by the new World Weapons mechanic. It continues the use of quick time events and adds a new, promptless, free-form system. Four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability can be used as alternative combat options, and the game features puzzles and platforming elements. \"Ascension\" is the only installment in the series to include multiplayer, which is online-only and features modes for both competitive and cooperative play. It also features a redesigned combat system, new gameplay mechanics, and downloadable content. From October 2012 to March 2013, a social experience was available online in the form of a graphic novel titled \"Rise of the Warrior\", a prequel story that tied into the game's single-player and multiplayer modes.\n\n\"God of War: Ascension\" received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its fundamental gameplay and spectacle as true to the series, although the story was generally deemed to be less compelling than previous installments. The game's multiplayer element received mixed responses: although reviewers found that the gameplay translated well into the multiplayer element, they criticized the balance and depth of combat. \"Ascension\" did not perform as well as its predecessors in terms of sales and awards, but it did receive several nominations, including the Writers Guild of America Videogame Awards's \"Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing\" and the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design\".\n\nIn both of \"God of War: Ascension\"s single-player and multiplayer elements, it is primarily a third-person video game viewed from a fixed camera perspective. Some scenes in the single-player campaign feature a first-person camera view. In single-player mode, the player controls the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle games. The enemies are an assortment of creatures, most of whom are drawn from Greek mythology, including cyclopes, cerberuses, empusas, Sirens, Gorgons, satyrs, harpies, and centaurs. Other monsters were created specifically for the game, such as the juggernauts, wraiths, and manticores. Many of the monsters also appear in the multiplayer mode. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, and slide down walls to proceed through sections of the game. The game features a variety of puzzles, ranging from simple to complex.\n\nKratos' main weapon is the Blades of Chaos, a pair of blades attached to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World Weapon is not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes as part of the new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can tether enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he can throw the tethered enemy.\n\nFour magical disciplines are acquired, including the Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, and the Soul of Hades, which, depending on the magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property. For example, the Soul of Hades imbues the Blades with purple flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies. The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there. The Rage ability called Rage of the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability is automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking for an extended period of time, after which the meter must be refilled. The Rage ability is also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based Rage of Zeus.\n\nThree relics, the Amulet of Uroborus (Life Cycle mechanic), the Oath Stone of Orkos, and the Eyes of Truth, are acquired and needed for game progression. The Amulet of Uroborus allows Kratos to manipulate time by decaying or healing an object; examples include reconstructing broken pathways and using it during puzzle-solving. Construction can be paused or reversed if needed. The amulet can also be used against enemies to briefly slow their movements. The Oath Stone of Orkos gives Kratos the ability to create a \"shadow\" duplicate of himself that can depress plates, hold levers, or attack enemies. The Eyes of Truth remove illusions created by the Furies and cast a blinding light on enemies. As well as the quick time event (QTE) mechanic featured in the previous games, a new, promptless, free-form system allows players to choose when to attack or dodge based on the enemy's actions. When certain foes, such as a cyclops or a juggernaut, have been sufficiently weakened, the player may jump on their back and briefly force them to attack other foes.\n\nOther extra features include ten artifacts hidden in the game world that provide more abilities during New Game Plus, such as unlimited magic. This mode also allows players to change Kratos' costume, but trophies are disabled. A new feature absent from previous installments is \"Chapter Select\", which allows players to select and replay previously completed levels. Unlike previous installments, in which behind-the-scenes videos are unlocked after completing the game, these videos are already available from the main menu.\n\n\"God of War: Ascension\" is the only installment in the series to offer a multiplayer feature, which is online-only, and up to eight players can take part. The main objective for players is to take control of a map to earn rewards from the gods. Before entering multiplayer battles, each player is introduced to a warrior, who, like Kratos, is an oath-breaker and is imprisoned in the Prison of the Damned—the warrior's backstory is explored in \"Rise of the Warrior\". The player takes control of the warrior and aligns with one of the four deities: Ares, Hades, Zeus, or Poseidon. Each god offers a unique combat play-style and in-battle abilities. The attack style of the god with whom the player aligns is critical to their warrior's path. Players who ally with Ares are brute force experts with an up-close focus, although they are weak defensively, specifically to long range magical attacks. Players who ally with Zeus are magical experts with a focus on space control, although they are balanced by their lack of melee strength. Players who ally with Poseidon are supports with a focus on team synergy and self-sustenance; his synergistic powers can be replaced by more self-defense abilities if desired, although never as much as the other 3 gods. Players who ally with Hades are versatile, unlike the other 3, featuring other unique mechanics such as lifesteal, stealth and curses, making them excellent at controlling the flow of combat, although they can also choose to specialize in certain roles with certain armors or weaponry. Players can create up to three more warriors and have a champion representing each god.\n\nPlayers can unlock special magic abilities, new and upgraded armors, weapons, relics, and other treasures as they earn experience points (XP) to level-up their warrior. Players may also complete \"Labors\", which are challenges from the gods that rewards armor and weapons. Throughout multiplayer matches, players receive buffs and debuffs, and there is a color-coding system, called flashes, where a player's character will flash a certain color indicating a special property, such as vulnerability or invulnerability. A prestige feature called \"Ascension\", added in the June 10, 2013 update, allows players to reset their allegiance progression when they reach Level 40, and receive in-game currency for \"Godly\" armors and weapons—the \"most valuable and powerful items in the game\". They are classified as a Hero the first time they ascend and then a Demigod the second time and keep that title from then on.\n\nThere are five multiplayer modes: Team Favor of the Gods, Match of Champions, Trial of the Gods, Capture the Flag, and Bout of Honor. Team matches randomly assign players to compete on either the Spartan or Trojan team. The \"signature\" multiplayer mode is Team Favor of the Gods, in which two teams of two-to-four players try to win by accumulating a target quantity of points. Points, known as Favor, are earned by killing and other methods. When players are not on the offensive, they may help their team earn points by capturing altars, collecting red orbs from chests, and setting traps for opposing players. The non-team version, Match of Champions, is a four-to-eight-player deathmatch with a similar goal to Team Favor of the Gods. Trial of the Gods is a two-player, cooperative (co-op), time-trial mode in which the duo faces five waves of mythological monsters concluding with a boss fight. A single-player version is also available. In Capture the Flag, two teams of four players battle to capture the opposing team's flag and return it to their base until a target number of flags have been obtained. In Bout of Honor, added in the July 11, 2013 update, players test their skills in a best-of-seven-rounds one-on-one fight.\n\nAll but two of the fifteen multiplayer maps are based on locations explored throughout the \"God of War\" series, with eight of those based on locations explored in \"Ascension\"; for example, Desert of Lost Souls is from the original \"God of War\", Bog of the Forgotten is from \"God of War II\", and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from \"God of War III\". The two original maps are the Coliseum of Persia and the Walls of Troy (which features the Trojan Horse). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the Desert of Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team.\n\nAs with previous games, \"God of War: Ascension\" is set in an alternate version of ancient Greece populated by the Olympian Gods, Titans, and other beings from Greek mythology. Game events are set six months after Kratos killed his family, and ten years before the original \"God of War\" (2005). The next game chronologically would be \"Chains of Olympus\" (2008), which takes place some time between \"Ascension\" and \"God of War\" (2005). The game's narrative takes place over four weeks; it shifts between the present (the fourth week) and past (the preceding three weeks), while the player controls Kratos in both. Several locations, including the Prison of the Damned and some real-world locations—including the village Kirra, the city Delphi, and the island Delos—are explored in the game.\n\nThe Prison of the Damned is the Furies' massive prison to house all oath-breakers. Kirra is an abandoned village that lost its water supply after its water wheel and aqueduct were destroyed. Other than monsters, the only life is in its harbor, where the tamed Harbor Master guides vessels in and out of the port. Delphi is located in the snowy mountains north of Kirra and features the Tower of Delphi. After activating three massive, mechanical pythons, the Tower allows access to the Temple of Delphi, home of the Oracle. Delos features a Titan-sized statue of Apollo, constructed by the inventor Archimedes to honor the god.\n\nThe game's protagonist is Kratos (voiced by Terrence C. Carson), a Spartan warrior who broke his blood oath to the god Ares after being tricked into killing his family by his former master. The main antagonists are the three Furies: Megaera (Nika Futterman), Tisiphone (Debi Mae West), and the Fury Queen, Alecto (Jennifer Hale). The Furies are the guardians of honor and the bane of traitors, who punish those they deem guilty. They were spawned from the eons-long war between the Primordials, the beings who created the Earth. Other characters include the oath keeper Orkos (Troy Baker), the son of Ares and Alecto, who was disowned by the god as he was not the perfect warrior that Ares sought; Aletheia (Adrienne Barbeau), the Oracle of Delphi with prophetic sight; the corrupted Prophet Castor (David W. Collins) and his conjoined twin Pollux (Brad Grusnick), who usurped the oracle, deciding who can consult her; and the Scribe of Hecatonchires (Robin Atkin Downes), the first mortal imprisoned by the Furies who has been keeping records to maintain his sanity. Kratos' wife Lysandra (Jennifer Hale) and his daughter Calliope appear in an illusion created by Alecto, and the King of Sparta (Crispin Freeman) and the Village Oracle (Susan Blakeslee) appear in an illusion created by Tisiphone with the help of her familiar, Daemon.\n\nIn the game's multiplayer mode, Zeus (Corey Burton), the King of the Olympian Gods, Ares (Steven Blum), the God of War, Poseidon (Gideon Emery), the God of the Sea, and Hades (Fred Tatasciore), the God of the Underworld, appear as statues at the Rotunda of Olympus where the player selects one to align to, after which the chosen god will communicate with the player during gameplay. Castor and Pollux, the demigod Hercules (Kevin Sorbo), the Titan cyclops Polyphemus, the Gorgon Stheno, and the giant scorpion Skorpius also appear in the multiplayer as bosses and/or environmental obstacles.\n\nThe game begins with Kratos, who is imprisoned, chained, and tormented by the Furies for breaking his blood oath to Ares. The Fury Megaera tortures Kratos, but he manages to break free. Chasing her through the prison, he discovers that the prison itself is Aegaeon the Hecatonchires, the first traitor of the Furies who had broken a blood oath to Zeus; he was turned into the Prison of the Damned as punishment. Overcoming an illusion created by the Fury Tisiphone and her familiar Daemon, Kratos finds and kills Megaera, retrieving the Amulet of Uroborus, which the Furies had confiscated from him when he was imprisoned.\n\nThe narrative shifts to three weeks before Kratos' imprisonment. Confronted by Orkos in the Village of Kirra, Kratos is advised that the visions he has been experiencing are mind tricks created by the Furies, and instructs him to find the Oracle of Delphi. Upon arrival at the Temple of Delphi, he overcomes Castor and Pollux, who tried to kill the Oracle. In her dying breath, the Oracle instructs Kratos to travel to Delos to retrieve the Eyes of Truth. Taking the Amulet of Uroborus from the now-dead Castor and Pollux, Kratos travels to Kirra's harbor, where he again encounters Orkos. The oath keeper reveals that Ares wanted a perfect warrior to help him overthrow Zeus, so Ares helped Kratos against the barbarians to make him into a perfect warrior. Orkos became the oath keeper and did not question the Furies until Ares tricked Kratos into killing his own family. Armed with this knowledge, Kratos takes a ship to Delos.\n\nA week later, Kratos arrives at the island of Delos and explores the ruined statue of Apollo. He is attacked by all three Furies and is eventually captured. Orkos appears and frees Kratos, transporting him to another location. Orkos gives Kratos his Oath Stone and reveals that he and Aletheia tried to warn Zeus of Ares' and the Furies' plan. In retaliation, they took the Oracle's eyes, the objects Kratos seeks. After a perilous journey, Kratos uses the Amulet of Uroborus to restore the statue and retrieve the eyes. On completing the Trials of Archimedes, Kratos is ambushed and captured by the Furies, who confiscate all of his items.\n\nBack in the present time, Tisiphone and Daemon cast another illusion to deceive Kratos, who overcomes it and retrieves the Oath Stone of Orkos. He encounters the Scribe of Hecatonchires, who reveals that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment, but devolved into ruthless beings because of Ares. Continuing his pursuit of the Furies, Kratos reaches the door to Alecto's Chamber, but seemingly returns home to his wife and daughter: another illusion, this time cast by the Fury Queen Alecto. She tries to convince Kratos he can live within this illusion if he rejoins Ares, but he refuses. Enraged, Alecto and Tisiphone attack Kratos, who retrieves the eyes, and Alecto transforms into a giant sea monster. After a brutal battle, Kratos uses the eyes to break through the Furies' illusions before killing them both, which destroys the prison.\n\nKratos returns to Sparta, where he is met by Orkos. He praises Kratos' victory over the Furies, but reveals that Kratos will not be free from Ares' bond unless he kills Orkos. He begs Kratos to give him an honorable death, which will free them both from Ares. Kratos initially refuses but Orkos' continuing pleas ultimately force Kratos to kill him. Afterward, Kratos experiences the first of many nightmares—previously masked by his bond—and discovers his path to redemption through continual service to Olympus. Kratos burns down his house with the corpse of Orkos inside and leaves, beginning his path towards becoming the champion of the gods.\n\nIn January 2010, Santa Monica's studio director John Hight told video-gaming blog Joystiq that \"while \"God of War III\" will conclude the trilogy, it won't spell the end of the franchise\" and said \"We're going to be really careful about what we do next.\" From April 2011 until April 2012, several sources claimed that a fourth main entry would release sometime in 2012 and would feature an online component. On April 12, 2012, Sony released a teaser image on its official PlayStation Facebook page, which was followed by the game's announcement on April 19, though Amazon leaked the announcement the day before. The trailer announced Todd Papy, who had worked as a designer on \"God of War\" and \"God of War II\" and as Design Director on \"God of War III\", as Game Director. David Jaffe confirmed that \"God of War III\" Game Director Stig Asmussen did not return to direct this game because he was working on another project at Santa Monica. The announcement trailer was narrated by Linda Hunt; it refers to a time before Kratos became the Ghost of Sparta and was not \"bound in blood\". The announcement officially confirmed that the game's title would be \"God of War: Ascension\". Papy said the game was not titled \"God of War IV\" to avoid confusion because it is a prequel, rather than a sequel, to the trilogy. The name was chosen because it complements the story and the additional multiplayer component; according to Papy, in this mode, players are \"basically ascending from an unknown hero to a god\".<ref name=\"4/30\"></ref>\n\nThe game features a retooled \"God of War III\" engine, enabling online multiplayer battles for up to eight players. Papy said to allow customization, Kratos and other known gods would not be included as playable characters in the multiplayer modes because the developers did not want \"red Kratos, blue Kratos, yellow Kratos\", and selecting gods would lock players into established roles. This decision was made \"to balance the game when players are pitted against each other\". Papy also said there would be no female characters because each character in the multiplayer mode is based on Kratos' animation model. The first demonstration of the game's multiplayer element featured the Team Favor of the Gods mode running on the map Desert of Lost Souls, which features the Titan cyclops Polyphemus. Multiplayer had been discussed for past games, but had never been implemented as previous game directors felt that \"God of War\" was a single-player-only experience; in \"Chains of Olympus\"s case, it was cut due to time constraints during development. For \"Ascension\", the development team made the decision to invest in multiplayer after a simple version, tested using two Kratoses, turned out to be \"a lot of fun\" for the game testers.\n\nThe development team faced challenges in adding multiplayer to an established single-player franchise. Other established franchises had been criticized for sub-par multiplayer implementations, so Santa Monica felt they had to prove to critics that their multiplayer mode would not be \"tacked on\". Since multiplayer was new to the team, new staff were hired who specialized in multiplayer, engineering, and design, but Santa Monica did not realize the amount of work required for the experience they had envisioned. Development was delayed because multiplayer mode required several rewrites. The player navigation code had to be changed for online play, which was initially designed for co-op; the team eventually decided this was unsatisfactory, and the changed approach cost significant development time. Local co-op was also explored, but the team decided to keep multiplayer online-only. The team finally \"found the heart of [the] final multiplayer game\" shortly before the first press show. Development focus switched back and forth between single-player and multiplayer; single-player received less attention while the team were preparing multiplayer for the first press announcement, but when single-player mode was reemphasized prior to its public debut, multiplayer mode suffered.\n\nDavid Jaffe, creator and Game Director of the original \"God of War\", spoke with \"NowGamer\" prior to the first press announcement in late April. He said that if he had worked on \"Ascension\", he would have incorporated three specific elements: different myths, a co-star, and \"look to the \"Zelda\" structure as a jumping off point\". He liked the idea of a cooperative mode, and added \"I'd love to see player one be Kratos and player two be this stupid annoying sidekick that—for some to be determined story reason—Kratos is stuck with for the whole adventure and in the end, once the main quest is over, Kratos just snaps the poor kid's neck\". In May 2012, Jaffe spoke with IGN about the multiplayer element: \"I think it looks cool. It looks like another great, impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game\", and added, \"If it turns out to be the case that the single player is watered down because of [multiplayer], then I think they have some justification. But I don't see any evidence of that, and I don't see evidence of that based on the team they are.\"\n\nAt Sony's 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference, the North American release date was confirmed as March 12, 2013. A single-player demo was shown, revealing new gameplay mechanics and combat systems. An encounter with the sea monster Charybdis was included in the demo, but this sequence was cut from the final game. Charybdis was recast as the creature that Alecto transforms into during the final fight of the game. The same day, Papy confirmed on PlayStation.Blog that a collector's edition of the game would be released. He said \"Ascension\" was being developed to feature stereoscopic 3D,<ref name=\"06/04\"></ref> but it was ultimately cut. At gamescom 2012, new multiplayer footage was shown, followed by the announcement of a multiplayer beta.\nAt the 2012 Penny Arcade Expo (PAX), Game Director Todd Papy, Lead Game Designer Mark Simon, Principal Character Artist Patrick Murphy, and writer of the \"God of War\" series Marianne Krawczyk, hosted the first \"God of War\" panel, discussing the origins of \"Ascension\", and provided an overview of the evolution of Kratos. The Fury Megaera was revealed, and Mark Simon discussed the new combat system. Papy said he had considered using the goddess Artemis as a playable female character, which would have offered the player alternative combat options. Artemis would have been depicted as half-human and half-feline, with the head and torso of a woman and the legs of a lioness. Artemis was ultimately cut from the game, but Papy said he would like to explore the possibility of using other gods in the future.\n\nIn the developmental transition from \"God of War III\" to \"Ascension\", one of the graphics engineers, Cedric Perthuis, noted that the limits of the \"God of War III\" engine restricted artist creativity, so they \"tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance.\" For example, the number of UV sets was increased to three per mesh. For a complex character model like Kratos, \"independent textures are needed for body parts unique to him, each wrapping around the head, torso and limbs - all of which form an editable 'UV set' when laid out flat.\" Allowing more UV sets also made it possible to have a more natural look to the environment. \"Ascension\" was not as dramatic an advance in graphics over its predecessor as \"God of War III\" had been: \"From a graphics 'technical' perspective, to a large degree \"God of War: Ascension\" was more refinement on the graphics front\" said another graphics engineer, Ben Diamand, who focused on optimization during \"Ascension\"s development. The development team also added dynamic lighting, which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic. Particle effects were also greatly improved from \"God of War III\": \"the idea was to give artists more control to achieve better results with less particles\" said Perthuis.\n\nTerrence C. Carson, Linda Hunt, Corey Burton, Gideon Emery, Steven Blum, and Kevin Sorbo reprised their roles as Kratos, the narrator, Zeus, Poseidon, Ares, and Hercules, respectively. Jennifer Hale, who voiced two characters in the , voiced the Fury Alecto and Kratos' wife, Lysandra, who was previously voiced by Gwendoline Yeo. Debi Mae West, Adrienne Barbeau, and Crispin Freeman, who had each done voice work on previous installments, voiced the characters Tisiphone, Aletheia, and the King of Sparta. Troy Baker voiced the oath keeper Orkos and is the announcer in the multiplayer mode. Series veteran Fred Tatasciore assumed the role of Hades, who was previously voiced by Clancy Brown. Susan Blakeslee reprised her role as the Village Oracle, who makes a cameo appearance as an illusion created by Tisiphone. Unlike previous games in which motion capture and voice recording were done separately, \"Ascension\" used \"voice-over motion capture\"; voice recording and motion capture were done at the same time, which allowed the voice actors to act out their characters' scenes together. The voice-over motion capture was done at House of Moves in Culver City, California.\n\nA global multiplayer beta was announced at gamescom 2012. The beta included features that had not been previously revealed. Players who participated in the \"Rise of the Warrior\" social challenge on GodofWar.com received early access to the beta in December 2012. Players from SCE Europe also received an opportunity to access the beta early. The beta became available for PlayStation Plus subscribers on January 8, 2013. On January 19, Santa Monica allowed all PlayStation Network users in North and South America access to the beta via a redeemable voucher. The beta test ended at midnight Pacific time on January 21. In the beta, players could choose to align themselves with Ares or Zeus. It featured the eight-player Desert of Lost Souls map and the four-player Forum of Hercules map. The beta included the Desert of Lost Souls map in the modes Team Favor of the Gods and Capture the Flag, and the Forum of Hercules map in the mode Favor of the Gods, renamed Match of Champions in final release. All participants of the beta received the Champion's Armor and Blade for their multiplayer character when the game launched.\n\nAccording to Santa Monica's senior producer Whitney Wade and director of internal development Chacko Sonny, the beta made the team look at the game as an \"evolving service\". The beta allowed the developers to make sure that the game design would meet with the approval of existing fans of the series, and that the system could cope with a high volume of players. Wade and Sonny said the testing went as expected, \"revealing successive layers of issues that we would address, deploy fixes for, and then monitor in a live environment.\" The most important change from the beta, they said, was their planning in how to support the game post-launch. The team designed a process that allowed them to \"quickly iterate on fixes, deploy them through infrastructure (testing, certification, patching), and coordinate with internal technology partners within Sony.\" They also developed a system to allow them to monitor, log, and interpret any changes added, and the beta test gave insight on how to prioritize key features.\n\nAt E3 2012, a single-player demo was shown, featuring new gameplay mechanics and combat systems. The demo revealed a redesigned quick time event mini-game, which replaced some button prompts with a new, prompt-less, free-form system. It featured the World Weapons mechanic and Kratos was shown to be capable of swinging opponents through the air while simultaneously attacking. Other new features included the Fire of Ares magic and the \"Life Cycle\" mechanic. Several new enemies, such as the juggernaut and the sea beast Charybdis, were also featured, though the latter was cut from the final game. The E3 2012 single-player demo was included with early copies of the \"Director's Cut\" Blu-ray edition and Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack versions of the film, \"Total Recall\", which were released on December 18, 2012. On February 26, 2013, a new single-player demo titled the Prison of the Damned was released on the PlayStation Store to download. Participants of the \"Rise of the Warrior\" social challenge who were on the Spartan team received access to the demo on February 20. The demo comprises the first 30-minutes of the single-player mode.\n\n\"God of War: Ascension\" was released in North America on March 12, 2013, in mainland Europe and PAL regions on March 13, in Australia and New Zealand on March 14, and in the UK and Ireland on March 15. In the US, it sold 570,000 units in the first month of its release not including bundled sales, making it the fourth-best-selling game of March 2013. The game's sales were significantly lower than \"God of War III\"s first month sales, which were 1.1 million units. On October 15, 2013, \"God of War: Ascension\" was released as a digital download on the PlayStation Store in North America. The digital version was released in Europe and Australia on October 23, and in Japan and Asia on October 31. On September 24, 2014, \"God of War: Ascension\" became available to play from Sony's game streaming service PlayStation Now.\n\n\"God of War: Ascension\"s marketing campaign initially focused on its multiplayer feature. Between October 22, 2012, and the day of the game's release, there were four multiplayer trailers that featured each of the gods that players can align to, showcasing some of the abilities that players receive from them. On December 12, 2012, a multiplayer trailer titled \"Evil Ways\" was released, featuring Polyphemus. The first single-player trailer since the initial one in April 2012 came on January 19, 2013. A live action trailer titled \"From Ashes\" was played during Super Bowl XLVII, which was followed by the last single-player trailer on February 26.\n\nOn June 4, 2012, Santa Monica Studio announced the release of \"God of War: Ascension—Collector's Edition\", which was available for a limited time in North America. The package included a statue of Kratos, a premium SteelBook game case, and exclusive downloadable content (DLC) available via the PlayStation Network (PSN). The exclusive DLC included the official game soundtrack, a PS3 dynamic XrossMediaBar (XMB) theme, a PSN avatar pack, 48 hours of double XP for multiplayer, and a Season Pass to unlock all future DLC weapons and armor at no extra cost. On August 30, 2012, Santa Monica announced the release of the \"Collector's Edition\" for European territories. The \"God of War: Ascension—Special Edition\" was also announced for release in European territories and was available for the same price as the standard edition. It included the premium SteelBook game case and the DLC that was available in the \"Collector's Edition\", although not the Season Pass. The \"God of War: Ascension Legacy Bundle\", which included \"Ascension\", \"God of War Saga\", a one-month subscription to PlayStation Plus, and a 500 GB garnet red PS3, was available for a limited time. Similarly, the UK received an exclusive PS3 bundle, which included a white 500 GB PS3, the \"God of War: Ascension—Special Edition\", and a special \"God of War: Ascension\" DualShock 3 controller, which was released separately in Australia.\n\nPre-orders for the \"Collector's Edition\" commenced on June 4, 2012, in North America. Participating retailers offered the \"Mythological Heroes Multiplayer DLC Pack\" as a bonus for pre-ordering the standard or \"Collector's Edition\" of the game. The DLC pack included the armors of Achilles, Odysseus, Orion, and Perseus. Along with the DLC pack, GameStop offered an exclusive pre-order bonus—the armor and spear of King Leonidas, as depicted by Gerard Butler in the 2007 film \"300\", for use in multiplayer mode, and a double-sided \"God of War: Ascension\" poster measuring . For a limited time, all copies of \"God of War: Ascension\" purchased from Best Buy included the multiplayer weapon Mjölnir (the Hammer of Thor), inspired by the television series \"Vikings\", as DLC. Walmart offered the Blade of Judgment multiplayer weapon as an exclusive pre-order bonus. All copies of \"God of War: Ascension\" included early access to the demo of Naughty Dog's video game \"The Last of Us\". In North America, all copies included a voucher to download the characters Zeus and Isaac Clarke for \"PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale\".\n\n\"Rise of the Warrior\" was a graphic novel by Marianne Krawczyk with art by Christopher Shy. Only available on GodofWar.com, it was a prequel story that tied into \"Ascension\"s single-player and multiplayer modes, and had 20 chapters that were released from October 2012 to March 2013. It also featured a social experience during that same time period. For the social experience, players were aligned with either the Spartans or the Trojans and competed via social challenges to earn points, such as answering questions and solving riddles for each chapter. In the first challenge, the teams competed to earn their army a week of exclusive, early access to the multiplayer beta test that began on December 12, and a one-month subscription to PlayStation Plus, which was won by the Spartans; the Trojans received access on December 17. The Spartans also won the next team challenge and received early access to the Prison of the Damned single-player demo on February 20, 2013. Players could also earn early, in-game unlocks for the final game's multiplayer mode, including exclusive weapons and armor for all players who attained the rank of Champion of the Gods.\n\nThe story followed an unnamed warrior who became the player's character in the multiplayer mode. The warrior was a native of Kirra whose father was killed by a cruel general who poisoned the water supply of the village, killing many people. Before dying, the warrior's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm come to their family. The warrior swore his father's oath and was met by a cloaked figure, The Giver, who guided him and followed him throughout his journey. Soon after, the warrior called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water; the god destroyed the aqueduct and water wheel that supplied water to the village. The warrior then encountered the surviving soldiers who had been under his father's command. One soldier told the warrior that swords alone could not defeat the general. The warrior and his men traveled to the land of Aeaea and recruited the witch Circe, who seemingly also sought revenge against the general. Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested that they see the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses. During this time, the warrior vowed loyalty to Poseidon and to protect his men.\n\nAfter traveling through Delphi, the warrior obtained the venomous blood of a cerberus. Eventually, both Circe and the warrior encountered the general, who was revealed to be the warrior's uncle. The general revealed that he killed the warrior's father because he refused to join the general. Circe was then revealed to be the general's lover who had only aided the warrior so he would reach the general, who planned to offer the warrior a chance to serve him in his warmongering conquests. The warrior refused, and Circe offered him with a choice; to serve the general and his men would be spared from Circe's wrath, or to kill the general and his men shall die. The Giver, who followed the two, reminded the warrior that if he were to kill the general, who was a member of his family, the oath he made to his father would be broken, yet if he killed Circe, his men would perish and the oath he made to protect his men would be broken. The warrior declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men. However, he tricked the general into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus's blood, which killed the general. Circe was aghast at the warrior's vengeful act and retreated. Because the warrior killed his own uncle, the oath he made to his father was broken. The Giver revealed himself to be Orkos, the oath keeper of the Furies and the warrior was imprisoned by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned.\n\nAs well as the downloadable content (DLC) included in the \"Collector's Edition\", the pre-order bonuses, and DLC from \"Rise of the Warrior\", the developers released several multiplayer DLC packs after the game's release. All multiplayer maps that were released post-launch are free, and players who obtained the Season Pass from the \"Collector's Edition\" received all DLC weapons and armors at no additional cost. DLC weapons and armors can be purchased separately or in bundles. Other DLC, such as XP boosters, is available; these were not covered by the Season Pass. On May 7, 2013, the first set of DLC armors and weapons, including the \"Armors of Anarchy\" and the \"Blades of Darkness\", were released for purchase together with the free Chimeran Armor. Several other DLC packs, such as the \"Primordials Pack\", the \"Champions Pack\", the \"Marks of the Gods Pack\", and the \"Legendary Spears Pack\", were released.\n\nIn June 2013, Santa Monica announced the \"Community Cape Design Contest\", in which the \"God of War\" community could create and submit original cape designs. The winner's design was released as DLC. For a limited time the following month, Sony allowed players to trial all available DLC weapons. Some of the last sets of DLC released included co-op weapons, the \"Mantles of the Gods Pack\", several gauntlets, and the \"Fury Capes Pack\". On October 11, 2013, Santa Monica announced that no further DLC maps, weapons, armors, or marks would be produced, but multiplayer gaming would still be supported with patch updates. All DLC items received special pricing options for the release of the digital version of \"God of War: Ascension\". To celebrate the one year anniversary of the game's release, from March 25 through April 2, all DLC armor and weapons were available to download for free, XP boosters were discounted by 50%, and the developers released a Santa Monica Studio cape and a \"Marked One\" mark, allowing player's warriors to have Kratos' red tattoo when equipped.\n\nThe first maps were released via patch 1.06, called the \"Hunter\" update, on May 23, 2013. The \"Tower of Delphi\" and a modified version of the \"Coliseum of Persia\", which added Trial of the Gods mode, were included in this update. Because of technical difficulties experienced by some players who downloaded the patch, it was retracted and re-released via update 1.07 on June 3. Players who lost all online progress due to 1.06 received two 48-hour voucher codes granting five times the amount of XP earned, the Season Pass, 50 weapon and armor shards, and a special voucher code for the \"Ascension\" feature that ascended these players to \"Hero\", giving them immediate access to the Godly weapons and armors. The second set of maps were released via update 1.09 on July 11. This update included four maps for the Bout of Honor mode—\"Canyons of Kirra\", \"Chamber of the Flame\", \"Landing at Delos\", and \"Streets of Sparta\"—and a four-player map, \"The Whirlpool of Alecto\". On August 1, update 1.10 was released and added Trial of the Gods to the \"Labyrinth of Daedalus\" map. The last multiplayer map, the eight-player \"Furnace of Archimedes\", was released via update 1.11 on August 27.\n\n\"God of War: Ascension (Original Soundtrack)\" was composed by Tyler Bates and was released on iTunes on March 5, 2013 by SCE and La-La Land Records. It was included as DLC in the \"God of War: Ascension—Collector's Edition\" and \"Special Edition\". On October 15, the soundtrack was made available for free on PSN for a limited time. A notable feature of \"Ascension\"s soundtrack is that it was scored by only one composer; all the previous games had multiple composers. Tyler Bates previously scored the similarly themed film \"300\" and game \"Rise of the Argonauts\". Bates said \"My goal was to create a sound that supported the timeless dark age of \"God of War\", while expanding the parameters of the 'Sword and Sandals' genre.\" Although the game's story is linear, he approached the project as if he were scoring a novel as opposed to a film. Bates did not play any of the previous games and chose not to in order to take the score \"to new places without being overtly aware of the great music that is emblematic\" of the prior installments. The soundtrack was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, and features solo vocal work from Rafe Pearlman and Ciscandra Nostalghia.\n\nThroughout the score, Bates uses a combination of techniques \"to increase the drama of the game\" said Emily McMillan of Game Music Online, who gave the album a 4 out of 5 stars. She said one of Bates's signature techniques is \"an intense and simultaneous crescendo and glissando.\" All of the themes take place on a harmonic minor scale. On the track, \"Warriors' Truth\", Bates used Gerard Marino's main \"God of War\" theme and \"twists it for the prequel setting\", \"taking the harmonic ascending scale and reverting it to a downwards pattern with a harsh choir/brass combination.\" The track \"Visions of Ruin\" features the cimbalom, which is rarely used in video game soundtracks. She said overall \"The music is powerful, rich, and pulsing\", though listening to the whole album can seem repetitive.\n\n\"God of War: Ascension\" received generally favorable reviews upon release. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave it an average review score of 79.34% (based on 58 reviews) and 80/100 (based on 89 reviews), respectively. Critics praised the fundamental gameplay and spectacle, but were critical of the lack of new ideas and gave a mixed response to the additional multiplayer mode. Alex Simmons of IGN said the redesigned combat system adds a source of depth: \"Learning how to use each power effectively ... provides a strategic lifeline when there's no energy re-gen chest nearby\". Although he initially found the World Weapons useful, he felt that they became unnecessary after upgrading the Blades of Chaos. Simmons felt the magic system was a \"positive step\"; since magic attacks are unlocked at a later time, players cannot rely on them as much as they may have done in previous installments, which encourages players \"to think wisely about where to allocate experience points rather than being the ultimate badass from the outset\".\n\nCombat and the new gameplay mechanics were well-received, with Dale North of Destructoid saying \"\"God of War\" has never looked or played better than this\", and Xav de Matos of Joystiq commenting that the combat is simpler than in \"God of War III\", and rarely required much adjustment. Opinions on difficulty varied; Simmons felt that most of the gameplay was balanced, and that \"Ascension\" \"is probably the easiest\" in the series, but both he and Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar commented that some areas, such as the Trials of Archimedes, were too difficult. Simmons felt that in some sections, the many enemies made dying feel \"cheap and frustrating\", and in Cooper's opinion, some points in the game \"[test] your patience, rather than your skills—including one [the Trials] that's easily the most difficult section in any \"God of War\" game to date, for all the wrong reasons\".\n\nBoth Simmons and Matos criticized the story; Simmons felt that although the narrative is \"meticulously delivered\", it \"felt a bit incidental\", and said that in comparison to Zeus and Ares, \"the Furies don't quite cut it\". Matos was critical of the plot framing and the narrative structure as \"just too chaotic\"; he argued that \"the narrative fabric woven throughout the franchise has begun to split\", and \"Ascension\" does little to enhance its characters \"in any meaningful way\". He did praise the game for providing the \"distinct \"God of War\" flair\" known to the series.\n\nCooper praised the enhanced graphics engine as \"not only the best the franchise has seen, but some of the most impressive on the PlayStation 3\", and was impressed by Kratos' foes. North agreed, saying \"there's a shine and polish that runs throughout the game that makes it a perfect send-off for the PS3\", noting its improved textures, animations, and lighting. The review from \"Edge\" magazine also positively reviewed the graphics, but had some frustrations with the visual approach, such as some camera angles.\n\nMatos was broadly critical of the game's multiplayer mode, though he singled out some elements, such as the maps, as well-designed. He disliked the connection to single-player mode, calling it \"a weird narrative tie-in\", and was concerned that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element, \"the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience ... it doesn't feel deep enough to command much more than a furiously dedicated fan following\". Simmons was more positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is \"a genuinely fresh addition ... that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player [game]\". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his favorite mode, but did not feel that the combat offered enough depth to make multiplayer \"a truly engaging experience\", describing it instead as \"a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition\". The review from \"Edge\" magazine described multiplayer mode as \"chaotic at first\", with overwhelming options, but said that it becomes easier as players learn the levels. The \"Edge\" review identified the fixed camera system as an asset because \"you can always see exactly what's going on and fight your opponents instead of the viewpoint\", and also praised the color-coding system, which \"effectively lets you know when you have an opening and when to run\".\n\nSome reviewers disliked the title of one of the game's trophies, \"Bros before Hos\", which is received after graphically face-stomping a female villain. In response to the criticisms of misogyny, Santa Monica released a patch changing the name of the trophy to \"Bros before Foes\".\n\nUnlike previous installments, \"God of War: Ascension\" won no awards, but it was nominated in several Best of E3 2012 categories by various media outlets. These nominations included \"Best Action/Adventure\" and \"Best Multiplayer\" from Game Rant, \"Best PS3 Game\" and \"Best Action/Adventure Game\" from G4, \"Best PlayStation 3 Game\" from Destructoid, and \"Best PS3 Game\" and \"Best Action Game\" from IGN. The game was a nominee for \"Best Visual Design\" at the 2013 Golden Joystick Awards. At the 2014 Writers Guild of America Videogame Awards, it was a nominee for \"Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing\" and during the 2014 D.I.C.E. Summit, it was a nominee for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "497525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=497525", "title": "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas", "text": "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\n\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It was released on 26 October 2004 for PlayStation 2, and on 7 June 2005 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox. A high definition remastered version received a physical release for both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on 30 June 2015 and 1 December 2015, respectively. It is the seventh title in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, and the first main entry since 2002's \"\". It was released on the same day as the handheld game \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\" for Game Boy Advance. On 8 June 2018, the game was added to the Xbox One Backward Compatible library.\n\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" is played from a third-person perspective in an open world environment, allowing the player to interact with the game world at their leisure. The game is set within the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, which is heavily based on California and Nevada. The state of San Andreas consists of three metropolitan cities: Los Santos, based on Los Angeles; San Fierro, based on San Francisco; and Las Venturas, based on Las Vegas. The single-player story follows Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, an ex-gangbanger who returns home to Los Santos from Liberty City after his mother's murder. Carl finds his old friends and family in disarray, and over the course of the game he attempts to re-establish his old gang, clashes with corrupt cops, and gradually unravels the truth behind his mother's murder. The plot is based on multiple real-life events in Los Angeles, including the rivalry between the Bloods, Crips, and Hispanic street gangs, the 1980s crack epidemic, the LAPD Rampart scandal, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.\n\nConsidered one of the sixth generation of video gaming's most significant titles, and by many reviewers to be one of the greatest video games ever made, \"San Andreas\" received rave reviews by many critics who praised the music, story and gameplay. It became the best-selling video game of 2004, and has sold over 27.5 million copies worldwide ; it remains the best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time. The game, like its predecessors, is cited as a landmark in video games for its far-reaching influence within the industry. However, the violence and sexual content of \"San Andreas\" has been the source of much public concern and controversy. In particular, a player-made software patch, dubbed the \"Hot Coffee mod\", unlocked a previously hidden sexual scene. The next main entry in the series, \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", was released in April 2008. \"San Andreas\" has been ported to various other platforms and services, such as OS X, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network and mobile devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Fire OS).\n\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" is an action-adventure game with role-playing and stealth elements. Structured similarly to the previous two games in the series, the core gameplay consists of elements in a third-person shooter and a driving game, affording the player a large, open world environment in which to move around. On foot, the player's character is capable of walking, running, sprinting, swimming, climbing and jumping as well as using weapons and various forms of hand-to-hand combat. The player can drive a variety of vehicles, including automobiles, buses, semis, boats, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, trains, tanks, motorcycles and bikes. The player may also import vehicles in addition to stealing them.\n\nThe open, non-linear environment allows the player to explore and choose how they wish to play the game. Although storyline missions are necessary to progress through the game and unlock certain cities and content, they are not required as the player can complete them at their own leisure. When not taking on a storyline mission, the player can freely-roam and look around the cities of San Andreas, eat in restaurants, or cause havoc by attacking people and causing destruction. Creating havoc can attract unwanted and potentially fatal attention from the authorities. The more chaos caused, the stronger the response: police will handle \"minor\" infractions (attacking pedestrians, pointing guns at people, stealing vehicles, manslaughter, etc.), whereas SWAT teams, the FBI, and the military respond to higher wanted levels.\n\nThe player can partake in a variety of optional side missions that can boost their character's attributes or provide another source of income. The traditional side missions of the past games are included, such as dropping off taxi cab passengers, putting out fires, driving injured people to the hospital and fighting crime as a vigilante. New additions include burglary missions, pimping missions, truck and train driving missions requiring the player to make deliveries on time, and driving/flying/boating/biking schools, which help the player learn skills and techniques to use in their corresponding vehicles.\n\nNot all locations are open to the player at the start of the game. Some locales, such as mod garages, restaurants, gyms, and shops, become available only after completing certain missions. Likewise, for the first portion of the game, only Los Santos and its immediate suburbs are available for exploration; unlocking the other cities and rural areas again requires the completion of certain missions. If the player were to travel in locked locations early in the game, they would end up attracting the attention of SWAT teams, police, and police-controlled Hydras if in an aircraft.\n\nUnlike \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and \"\", which needed loading screens when the player moved between different districts of the city, \"San Andreas\" has no load times when the player is in transit. The only loading screens in the game are for cut-scenes and interiors. Other differences between \"San Andreas\" and its predecessors include the switch from single-player to multiplayer Rampage missions (albeit not in the PC version), and the replacement of the 'hidden packages' with spray paint tags, hidden camera shots, horseshoes, and oysters to discover.\n\nThe camera, fighting, and targeting controls were reworked to incorporate concepts from another Rockstar game, \"Manhunt\", including various stealth elements, as well as improved target crosshairs and a target health indicator which changes from green to red to black depending on the target's health. The PC version of the game implements mouse chording; the player has to hold the right mouse button to activate the crosshairs, and then click or hold at the left mouse button to shoot or use an item, such as a camera.\nIn addition, players can swim and climb walls for the first time in the series. The ability to swim and dive underwater has a great effect on the player as well, since water is no longer an impassable barrier that kills the player (although it is possible to drown). For greater fire-power, the player can also dual wield firearms or perform a drive-by shooting with multiple gang members who can be recruited to follow the player. Due to the size of San Andreas, a waypoint reticle on the HUD map can be set, aiding the player in reaching a destination.\n\nRockstar has emphasised the personalisation of the main protagonist by adding role-playing video game elements. Clothing, accessories, haircuts, jewellery, and tattoos are available for purchase by the player, and have more of an effect on non-player characters' reactions than the clothing in \"Vice City\". CJ's level of respect among his fellow recruits and street friends varies according to his appearance and actions, as do his relationships with his girlfriends. The player must ensure CJ eats to stay healthy and exercises properly. The balance of food and physical activity has an effect on his appearance and physical attributes.\n\n\"San Andreas\" tracks acquired skills in areas such as driving, firearms handling, stamina, and lung capacity, which improve through use in the game. CJ may learn three different styles of hand-to-hand combat (boxing, kickboxing and kung fu) at the gyms in each of the game's three cities. CJ can speak with a number of pedestrians in the game, responding either negatively or positively. According to Rockstar, there are about 4,200 lines of spoken dialogue for CJ when the cutscenes are excluded.\n\nIn total, there are around 250 vehicles in the game compared to approximately 60 in \"Grand Theft Auto III\". New additions include bicycles, a combine harvester, a street sweeper, a jetpack and trailers amongst others. Car physics and features are similar to the \"Midnight Club\" series of street racing games, allowing for much more midair vehicle control as well as nitrous upgrades and aesthetic modification.\n\nThere are several different classes of vehicles that serve different purposes. Off-road vehicles perform better in rough environments, while racing cars perform better on tracks or on the street. Jets are fast, but usually need a runway to land. Helicopters can land almost anywhere and are much easier to control in the air, but are slower. While previous \"Grand Theft Auto\" games had only a few aircraft that were difficult to access and fly, \"San Andreas\" has eleven fixed-wing aircraft and nine helicopters and makes them more integral in the game's missions. There is also the ability to skydive from aircraft, using a parachute. Several boats were added, while some were highly modified.\n\nOther new features and changes from previous \"Grand Theft Auto\" games include:\n\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" takes place in 1992 within the state of San Andreas, which is based on sections of California and Nevada. It comprises three major fictional cities: Los Santos corresponds to Los Angeles, San Fierro corresponds to San Francisco, and Las Venturas corresponds to Las Vegas. The environments around these cities are also based on settings within the Southwestern region of the United States. Players can drive up the half-mile (800 m) tall Mount Chiliad (based on Mount Diablo), parachute from various peaks and skyscrapers, and visit 12 rural towns and villages located in five counties: Red County, Flint County, Bone County, Tierra Robada, and Whetstone. Other notable destinations include Sherman Dam (based on the Hoover Dam), a large secret military base called Area 69 (based on Area 51), a large satellite dish (based on a dish from the Very Large Array), Vinewood (based on Hollywood) and the Vinewood sign (based on the Hollywood sign) which is located in Mulholland, and many other geographical features. The bridges in San Fierro are based on the Forth road and rail bridges which link Edinburgh, the home of Rockstar North, to Fife although the road bridge is highly similar to the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. San Andreas is 13.9 square miles (36 square kilometres), almost four times as large as Vice City and five times as large as the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" rendition of Liberty City. The three cities are linked by numerous highways, a train system, and air travel. While its predecessors' areas were limited to urban locations, San Andreas includes not only large cities and suburbs, but also the rural areas between them.\n\nThe main character is a member of the Grove Street Families street gang, a set of a gang that also includes the initially-hostile Temple Drive and Seville Boulevard Families. The two main rival gangs are the Ballas and Los Santos Vagos, both based out of Los Santos. The Varrios Los Aztecas also operate in Los Santos. The main gangs of San Fierro are the San Fierro Rifa, led by T-Bone Mendez; the Da Nang Boys, a Vietnamese gang; and the San Fierro Triads, whose leader Wu Zi Mu forms an alliance with Carl. In Las Venturas, the only gangs are the Triads (run by Wu Zi Mu) and the Italian Mafia (consisting of the Forellis, Sindaccos, and Leones). The \"Loco Syndicate\" appears in the San Fierro mission chain, essentially made up of T-Bone Mendez's Rifa gangsters, Mike Toreno and a pimp Jizzy B. In addition, the Russian Mafia makes a few small appearances in the storyline.\n\nThe characters that appear in \"San Andreas\" are relatively diverse and relative to the respective cities and locales which each of them based himself in. This allows the game to include a significantly wider array of story lines and settings than in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and \"Vice City\". The player controls Carl \"CJ\" Johnson (Young Maylay), a young African-American gang member who serves as the game's protagonist.\n\nThe Los Santos stages of the game revolve around the theme of the Grove Street Families gang fighting with the Ballas and the Vagos for territory and respect. East Asian gangs (most notably the local Triads), an additional Vietnamese gang (the Da Nang Boys), and a force of Hispanic thugs working for the local \"Loco Syndicate\" (the San Fierro Rifa) are evident in the San Fierro leg of the game, while three Mafia families and the Triads who all own their respective casino are more prominently featured in the Las Venturas section of the game.\n\nLike the previous two \"Grand Theft Auto\" games, the voice actors of \"San Andreas\" include notable celebrities, such as David Cross, Andy Dick, Ron Foster, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Peter Fonda, Charlie Murphy, Frank Vincent, Chris Penn, Danny Dyer, Sara Tanaka, William Fichtner, Wil Wheaton, rappers Ice-T, Chuck D, Frost, MC Eiht and The Game and musicians George Clinton, Axl Rose, Sly and Robbie and Shaun Ryder. Young Maylay made his debut as the protagonist, Carl.\n\n\"The Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition\" lists it as the video game with the largest voice cast, with 861 credited voice actors, including 174 actors and 687 additional performers, many of those performers being fans of the series who wanted to appear on the game.\n\nIn 1992, Carl \"CJ\" Johnson (Young Maylay), a former gangbanger for the Los Santos-based Grove Street Families, returns home to Los Santos from Liberty City after learning of his mother's murder in a drive-by shooting. Upon his arrival, CJ is intercepted by a group of corrupt police officers led by Frank Tenpenny (Samuel L. Jackson). Tenpenny coerces CJ into working for him by threatening to frame CJ for the murder of an Internal Affairs officer, whose death had been orchestrated by Tenpenny.\n\nAfter Tenpenny lets him go, CJ reunites with his surviving family at his mother's funeral: his brother Sweet (Faizon Love) and his sister Kendl (Yo-Yo). Sweet angrily confronts CJ about his long absence from Los Santos and blames CJ for the Grove Street gang's declining fortunes. However, CJ wins Sweet's grudging acceptance by promising to stay and help rebuild the gang. The two brothers work closely with their friends, Big Smoke (Clifton Powell) and Ryder (MC Eiht), to reunite the divided Grove Street Families and reconquer their old turf from their rivals, the Ballas. During the gang war, CJ is occasionally sidetracked by orders from Officer Tenpenny, who forces CJ to assist him with black market and drug racketeering. Later, Sweet asks CJ to investigate Kendl's new boyfriend Cesar (Clifton Collins Jr.). Despite his preconceptions, CJ discovers that Cesar genuinely cares about Kendl, and the two men become friends.\n\nWith Grove Street stronger than ever, Sweet plans to ambush a major group of Ballas and end the war. However, before CJ can get to the fight, he receives a call from Cesar to meet elsewhere. Cesar shows CJ a shocking scene: Big Smoke, Ryder, Tenpenny, and the Ballas working together to hide the car used in the shooting which killed CJ's mother. Big Smoke and Ryder had arranged the shooting, and were working with Tenpenny and the Ballas to sell out Grove Street. CJ rushes to warn Sweet, but is too late, as Sweet is badly wounded from the Ballas counter-ambush. Tenpenny shows up and arrests them both. With Grove Street's leadership decapitated, Big Smoke and Ryder openly declare their alliance with the Ballas. They take over Los Santos and flood its streets with drugs, and with Tenpenny protecting them from police interference, they appear unstoppable.\n\nHowever, Tenpenny decides to get more use out of CJ. Instead of throwing CJ in prison, Tenpenny drives him into the rural country outside Los Santos, and threatens to arrange Sweet's death in prison if CJ doesn't co-operate. Exiled in the countryside, CJ is forced to carry out favors for C.R.A.S.H, under threat of Sweet being transferred to a cell block where Ballas affiliates are housed. He also works with Cesar's cousin Catalina (Cynthia Farrell) to make money by carrying out several heists in the area. He also befriends a hippie named The Truth (Peter Fonda) and a blind Chinese-American Triad leader named Wu Zi Mu (James Yaegashi). After winning the deed to a garage in San Fierro in a race against Catalina and her new boyfriend, CJ goes there with The Truth, Cesar and Kendl to get it up and running so they can make a living. While in San Fierro, CJ crosses paths with the Loco Syndicate, Big Smoke and Ryder's drug connection. CJ infiltrates the organisation and identifies its leader, Mike Toreno (James Woods). CJ kills Ryder and the other Loco Syndicate leaders, Jizzy B (Charlie Murphy) and T-Bone Mendez (Kid Frost), and shoots down Toreno's helicopter. CJ then destroys the Syndicate's drug factory.\n\nSoon after, CJ is called by an unknown man using a digitally distorted voice, who asks CJ to meet him at a ranch in the desert. There, CJ finds Mike Toreno alive, thus revealing Toreno as the caller. Toreno reveals that he is actually an undercover government agent spying on criminal operations and enlists CJ's help in several shady operations in exchange for Sweet's freedom. Meanwhile, CJ travels to Las Venturas, where Wu Zi Mu invites him to become a partner in the \"Four Dragons Casino\", where the organisation is facing problems from the mob families that control the city. Seeking to wrest control of Venturas from them, CJ helps Wu Zi Mu plot a robbery of the mob's casino and gains the mob's trust through various jobs for mob boss, Salvatore Leone (Frank Vincent). Eventually the heist is carried out successfully, earning the Triad a place of power in Las Venturas, although causing the mob to detest CJ. CJ also encounters rapper Madd Dogg (Ice-T), from whom he stole a rhyme book to help rapper OG Loc (Jas Anderson) become a name in the business. After rescuing Madd Dogg from a suicide attempt, he asks CJ to be his manager once he returns from rehab.\n\nTenpenny, fearing his arrest is inevitable, tasks his partner Pulaski (Chris Penn) with killing CJ and Officer Hernandez (Armando Riesco), whom Tenpenny found out was informing on them to Internal Affairs. While Pulaski forces CJ to dig his own grave, Hernandez, severely injured after being hit over the head with a shovel, manages to attack Pulaski, leading to his death. Pulaski attempts to escape, but CJ kills him. Madd Dogg returns from rehab, prompting CJ to return to Los Santos to get his music career started again. Toreno contacts CJ for one last favor, and finally has Sweet released from prison. Now rich and successful, CJ attempts to cut Sweet in on his businesses, but Sweet becomes angry that he ran away and let their home be taken over by rival gang members and drug dealers to make his fortune. While CJ helps Sweet once again kill the rival gangs, Tenpenny is arrested and tried for felonies that he has been charged with, but the charges are dropped due to lack of evidence, prompting a citywide riot. CJ helps Cesar regain control over the barrio and also regain territory for his gang, so as to have enough power to obtain knowledge of Big Smoke's whereabouts.\n\nSweet soon learns that Big Smoke is holed up in a fortified crack den in the city, and he and CJ go there to confront him. CJ enters the building alone, fighting his way to the top floor and confronting Smoke. CJ attempts to reason with Smoke, but the latter engages CJ in a gunfight. CJ defeats him and Smoke confesses that he betrayed the GSF in order to gain more power and money, and dies shortly after from his injuries. Tenpenny then arrives and holds CJ at gunpoint, before stealing Big Smoke's money, intending to use it to leave the city. Tenpenny escapes and CJ and Sweet pursue him. During the pursuit, Tenpenny loses control of a fire truck that he was using as a getaway vehicle, driving off the bridge over the Grove Street cul-de-sac and crashing at the entrance to it. CJ and his friends watch as a fatally wounded Tenpenny crawls from the wreckage and dies.\n\nIn the aftermath, CJ's family and friends arrive at the Johnson house for a meeting. Madd Dogg announces his first Gold record. As his friends and allies celebrate their success, CJ turns to leave.\n\n\"The Introduction\", an in-engine video, was provided on a DVD with the \"\", as well as the \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Special Edition\" re-release for the PlayStation 2. The 26-minute video chronicles the events leading up to the events in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" and provides insight on the development of the characters of the game, to the point when Carl learns of his mother's death in a phone call from Sean \"Sweet\" Johnson & returns to Los Santos to find his life is ruined. The film incorporates locations from the original \"Grand Theft Auto III\" game. The PS2 release also includes a live-action documentary on the custom car culture (featured prominently in the game) called \"Sunday Driver\".\n\nAs with the previous two entries in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, \"San Andreas\" has music taken from the time in which the game is based.\n\nSan Andreas is serviced by eleven radio stations; WCTR (talk radio), Master Sounds 98.3 (rare groove, playing many of the old funk and soul tracks sampled by 1990s hip-hop artists), K-Jah West (dub and reggae; modelled after K-Jah from \"Grand Theft Auto III\"), CSR (new jack swing, modern soul), Radio X (alternative rock, metal and grunge), Radio Los Santos (gangsta rap), SF-UR (old school Chicago house music), Bounce FM (funk), K-DST (classic rock), K-Rose (country) and Playback FM (classic hip hop).\n\nThe music system in \"San Andreas\" is enhanced from previous titles. In earlier games in the series, each radio station was essentially a single looped sound file, playing the same songs, announcements and advertisements in the same order each time. In \"San Andreas\", each section is held separately, and \"mixed\" randomly, allowing songs to be played in different orders, announcements to songs to be different each time, and plot events to be mentioned on the stations. This system would be used in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". WCTR, rather than featuring licensed music and DJs, features spoken word performances by actors such as Andy Dick performing as talk show hosts and listener callers in a parody of talk radio programming.\n\nLazlow again plays as himself on the show \"Entertaining America\" on WCTR in the same persona as in \"III\" and \"Vice City\". He takes over after the former presenter, Billy Dexter, is shot on air by in-game film star Jack Howitzer. Lazlow interviews guests such as O.G. Loc, who is one of the four characters Carl encounters during the game that is on the radio, along with Big Smoke, Madd Dogg, and The Truth.\n\nThe Xbox, iOS, and Windows versions of the game include an additional radio station that supports custom soundtracks by playing user imported MP3s, allowing players to listen to their own music while playing the game. This feature is not available on the PlayStation 2 version of the game or when played on the Xbox 360.\n\nUpon its release, \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" was met with critical acclaim. It received an average review score of 95/100, according to review aggregator Metacritic, tying for the fifth-highest ranked game in PlayStation 2 history. \"IGN\" rated the game a 9.9/10 (the highest score it has ever awarded to a PlayStation 2 game), calling it \"the defining piece of software\" for the PlayStation 2. \"GameSpot\" rated the game 9.6/10, giving it an Editor's Choice award. Jeff Gerstmann said \"\"San Andreas\" definitely lives up to the \"Grand Theft Auto\" name. In fact, it's arguably the best game in the series\". \"San Andreas\" also received an A rating from the \"1UP.com\" network, and a 10/10 score from \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\". Common praises were made about the game's open-endedness, the size of the state of San Andreas, and the engaging storyline and voice acting. Most criticisms of the game stemmed from graphical mishaps, poor character models, and low-resolution textures, as well as various control issues, particularly with auto-aiming at enemies. Some critics commented that while a lot of new content had been added to \"San Andreas\", little of it had been refined or implemented well. Nevertheless, since its release, \"San Andreas\" has been regarded to be one of the greatest games of all time, placing at number 27 in \"Edge\" Top 100 Games to Play Today. \"Edge\" declared that the game remains \"the ultimate expression of freedom, before next-gen reined it all back in.\" In 2015, the game placed 8th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.\n\nBy 3 March 2005, the game had sold over 12 million units for the PlayStation 2 alone, making it the highest selling game for PlayStation 2. The game received a \"Diamond\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 1 million copies in the United Kingdom. As of 26 September 2007, \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" has sold 20 million units according to Take-Two Interactive. As of 26 March 2008, \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" has sold 21.5 million units according to Take-Two Interactive. The Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition lists it as the most successful PlayStation 2 game, with 17.33 million copies sold for that console alone, from a total of 21.5 million in all formats. In 2011, Kotaku reported that according to Rockstar Games, \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" has sold 27.5 million copies worldwide.\n\n\"San Andreas\" was criticised by some for its perceived racial stereotyping. Some saw the alleged stereotyping as ironic, while others defended the game, noting that the storyline could speak to people of different backgrounds. A study of how different groups of youths engaged with the game found that \"they do not passively receive the games' images and content\".\n\nIn mid-June 2005, a software patch for the game dubbed the \"Hot Coffee mod\" was released by Patrick Wildenborg (under the Internet alias \"PatrickW\"), a 38-year-old modder from the Netherlands. The name \"Hot Coffee\" refers to the way the released game alludes to the unseen sex scenes. In the unmodified game, the player takes his girlfriend to her front door and she asks him if he would like to come in for \"some coffee\". He agrees, and the camera stays outside, swaying back and forth a bit, while moaning sounds are heard. After installing the patch, users can enter the main character's girlfriends' houses and engage in a crudely rendered, fully clothed sexual intercourse mini-game. The fallout from the controversy resulted in a public response from high-ranking politicians in the United States and elsewhere and resulted in the game's recall and re-release.\nOn 20 July 2005, North America's organisation who establish content ratings for video games, the ESRB, changed the rating of the game from Mature (M) to Adults Only (AO), making \"San Andreas\" the only mass-released AO console game in the United States. Rockstar announced that it would cease production of the version of the game that included the controversial content. Rockstar gave distributors the option of applying an Adults Only ESRB rating sticker to copies of the game, or returning them to be replaced by versions without the Hot Coffee content. Many retailers pulled the game off their shelves in compliance with their own store regulations that kept them from selling AO games. That same month in Australia, the Office of Film and Literature Classification revoked its original rating of MA15+, meaning that the game could no longer be sold there.\n\nIn August 2005, Rockstar North released an official \"Cold Coffee\" patch for the PC version of the game and re-released \"San Andreas\" with the \"Hot Coffee\" scenes removed (\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" Version 2.0), allowing the game to return to its \"M\" rating. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions have also been re-released with the \"Hot Coffee\" scenes removed in the Greatest Hits Edition, the Platinum Edition and the \"\"Grand Theft Auto\" Trilogy Pack\".\n\nOn 8 November 2007, Take-Two announced a proposed settlement to the class action litigation that had been brought against them following the Hot Coffee controversy. If the proposed settlement is approved by the court, neither Take-Two nor Rockstar would admit liability or wrongdoing. Consumers would be able to swap their AO-rated copies of the game for M-rated versions and may also qualify for a $35 cash payment upon signing a sworn statement.\n\nA report in \"The New York Times\" on 25 June 2008 revealed that a total of 2,676 claims for the compensation package had been filed.\n\nRockstar released two follow-ups to \"San Andreas\": \"\" and \"\", both by Rockstar Leeds. Unlike \"San Andreas\" and its predecessors, \"Liberty City Stories\" and \"Vice City Stories\" were developed for the PlayStation Portable handheld, and there was no Windows or Xbox version although a PlayStation 2 port was released afterward. \"San Andreas\" thus marks the last major \"Grand Theft Auto\" release across the sixth-generation consoles to be produced by Rockstar North, as well as the last one to introduce an entirely new setting.\n\n\"Liberty City Stories\" and \"Vice City Stories\" are prequels to \"San Andreas\" predecessors, so both games derive their maps from \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and \"Vice City\", respectively, each of which cover a considerably smaller area than \"San Andreas\". \"Liberty City Stories\" and \"Vice City Stories\" eliminated gameplay elements introduced in \"San Andreas\", including the ability to swim (in \"Liberty City Stories\", but re-introduced in a limited capacity in \"Vice City Stories\") and climb. Both \"Liberty City Stories\" and \"Vice City Stories\" include references to characters featured in \"San Andreas\", with \"Liberty City Stories\" set about 6 years after the events of \"San Andreas\" (in that game, for example, radio reporter Richard Burns, featured in news bulletins in \"San Andreas\", returns as a radio call-in guest) and \"Vice City Stories\" set about 8 years before the events of \"San Andreas\". Except for news bulletins, radio programming in \"Liberty City Stories\" and \"Vice City Stories\" does not change based upon player progress. While character customisation elements such as wardrobe changes are retained, for later games, Rockstar eliminated the need for the game protagonists to eat and exercise.\n\n\"San Andreas\" marked the technological pinnacle of the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" era (also known as the \"3D Universe\") and also the end of that continuity (albeit for the handheld-focused \"Liberty City Stories\" and \"Vice City Stories\" spin-offs). Rockstar launched a new canon (the \"HD Universe\") with \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Grand Theft Auto V\" for the seventh-generation consoles. The celebrity voice acting that had been so prominent in the \"3D Universe\", especially in \"Vice City\" and \"San Andreas\", was scaled back in the \"HD Universe\". Rockstar also took a new direction in the series, focusing on realism and details instead of greater area and added content. For instance, although the explorable sandbox area is smaller than \"San Andreas\", the main setting for \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" is comparable to \"San Andreas\" in terms of scope when \"the level of verticality of the city, the number of buildings you can go into, and the level of detail in those buildings\" are taken into account. The goal for the HD Universe layout of Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts found in San Andreas state. Ars Technica wrote \"Grand Theft Auto IV\"s \"slight regression of the series from \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" is surprising: there are fewer vehicles, weapons, and story missions, less character customisation, and even the size of the city itself is smaller\".\n\nLos Santos, one of the three central cities in San Andreas, is the main location of the latest game in the franchise, \"Grand Theft Auto V\". Although \"GTA: San Andreas\" included three cities separated by open countryside, \"Grand Theft Auto V\" included only one city, Los Santos, as well as adjoining countryside and desert areas. By focusing their efforts on one city instead of three, the team were able to produce Los Santos in higher quality and at greater scale. For both games, Los Angeles was used as the model for Los Santos, but the team felt that the ambition of having three cities in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" was too great and that the game did not emulate the cities as well as they had hoped. Houser elaborated that \"to do a proper version of L.A., [...] the game has to give you a sense of that sprawl — if not completely replicate it\", and dividing the budget and manpower between multiple cities would have detracted from capturing \"what L.A. is\". Garbut felt that in the PlayStation 2 era the team did not have the technical capabilities to capture Los Angeles properly, resulting in the \"San Andreas\" rendition of Los Santos feeling like a \"backdrop or a game level with pedestrians randomly milling about\". Therefore, the team disregarded \"San Andreas\" as a jumping-off point for \"Grand Theft Auto V\", as they had moved on to a new generation of consoles since the former and wanted to build the city from scratch. As Garbut explained, with the move to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hardware, \"our processes and the fidelity of the world [had] evolved so much from \"San Andreas\"\" that using it as a model would have been redundant.\n\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" is distributed on Steam. The game received a notable amount of updates raising the version from 1.1 to 3.0. On 7 November 2014, an update caused controversy after 17 tracks from the soundtrack were removed due to expired licenses. Other drawbacks of the update include removal of widescreen support (which was later fixed via another minor update) and certain regions had incompatibility with older saves. Both old and new owners were affected by the update, unlike with \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", where only new owners were affected due to a similar update. Additionally, the game received native support for XInput-enabled gamepads and the removal of DRM.\n\nOn 12 December 2013, \"San Andreas\" was released on select iOS devices. The upgrades and enhancements from the original game include newly remastered graphics, consisting of dynamic and detailed shadows, greater draw distance, an enriched colour palette, plus enhanced character and car models. The Android and Amazon Kindle version was released on 19 December 2013 and Windows Phone version on 27 January 2014.\n\nIn 2008, the original Xbox version was released on Xbox 360; an emulated port as part of the Xbox Originals line-up. However, in late 2014 it was removed from the Xbox Live Marketplace and replaced with a port of the mobile version on 26 October 2014, the game's tenth anniversary. It featured HD 720p resolution, enhanced draw distance, a new menu interface, and achievements. While it introduced many new features, around ten songs were removed from the HD version that were present in the original due to licensing issues, and numerous new bugs were introduced. A physical release followed on 30 June 2015 in North America and 17 July 2015 elsewhere, under the \"Platinum Hits\" banner (\"Classics\" in PAL regions).\n\n\"San Andreas\" was first released on PlayStation 3 in December 2012 as an emulated PS2 Classic. This version was also removed in late 2014, leading to rumours of a PS3 HD release. However, this was not the case at the time and the PS2 Classic later returned. In early November 2015, the game was re-rated by the ESRB for an upcoming PS3-native release. The HD version was released on 1 December 2015, replacing the PS2 Classic on the PlayStation Store, and on physical media, gaining instant \"Greatest Hits\" status in North America. There has also been a PlayStation 4 version released, though unlike the remake for the PlayStation 3, it is an emulated port of the PlayStation 2 game, but it still has trophies and some songs edited out due to licensing restrictions.\n\n"}

The Service dropped \"Arbitration\" from its name in 2007, opting instead to use \"Adjudication\" to better reflect its role after the enactment of the 2005 Gambling Act.\n\nIBAS deals with several sectors in the realm of gambling. The sectors include:\n\nSince its inception, IBAS has been handling the majority of gambling disputes in the UK. In 2000, the first year that IBAS was fully operational, approximately 800 disputes went to panel, a number which remained relatively constant the following year in 2001. In 2002, the number of cases to panel rose to 1126 due to the abolishment of the UK's gambling tax. Again, IBAS saw another increase in cases to panel, this time as a result of the 2005 Gambling Act. In 2007, nearly 1700 disputes were handled by the IBAS panel, 372 of which were of the internet variety. IBAS claims to have awarded customers over £365,000 from dispute resolutions in 2007. There are also instances when IBAS rules in favour of the establishment, rather than the customer.\n\nIBAS will become involved in a dispute only after the gambling establishment and the customer(s) have made attempts to resolve the issue amongst themselves. If a deadlock remains, the dispute will be reviewed by IBAS if the following conditions are met:\n\n\nIf the dispute merits involvement, IBAS will accept written statements describing the conflict from both parties involved. IBAS verifies the establishment has upheld their own rules and regulations for gambling. If no rule that covers the dispute exists, IBAS will set forth its own rule based on what would be acceptable by industry standards. Both parties are bound by IBAS's ruling.\n\nOne objective of the UK Gambling Commission is to ensure that all gamblers are treated fairly in accordance with the rules and regulations established for gambling industry. This includes disputes between customers and gambling operators. By law, any sector in the realm of gambling under the jurisdiction of the Gambling Commission must use an independent, third party to resolve disputes. Because IBAS is recognised as the third party adjudicator for nearly all bookmakers in the UK, the Gambling Commission works closely with IBAS to reduce the number of disputes between customers and gambling operators.\n\nFrom time to time, IBAS publishes a case study on one of their past rulings. These case studies provide gamblers with examples of previous disputes to help prevent future problems between gamblers and operators. The studies focus on aspects of gambling that are often confusing or misinterpreted. Case studies are available for several betting options offered to UK gamblers.\n\nOne football study published stated that \"all football bets are based on 90 minutes, unless otherwise specified by the use of the words outright, win trophy or another suitable phrase that leaves no doubt as to the preferred settlement criteria.\" Bettors need to specify which option they desire prior to placing the intended wager, otherwise, the bet is assumed to be based on 90 minutes of play.\n\nIt is to be noted that every single one of their case studies is in favour of bookmakers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2052455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052455", "title": "Letkajenkka", "text": "Letkajenkka\n\nLetkajenkka, also known as Letkajenka in English and many other languages, is a Finnish dance.\n\nThe popular music genre and the ensuing dance craze were at their hottest during 1963–1965. Letkajenkka is based on the idea of performing Jenkka music using non-traditional instruments. Traditional instruments for playing the Jenkka, a Finnish traditional folk dance, are instruments such as the violin and accordion. In the early 1960s some composers thought of writing Jenkka tunes for more contemporary bands with more modern instruments, such as wind instruments (for a more swing-like Jenkka) and amplified instruments like electric guitars, basses, and drums (a more rock 'n' roll or boogie woogie-like sound). The form of the letkajenkka songs is consistent with traditional Jenkka, but where the music is distinctively Jenkka, the dance steps are not.\n\nErik Lindström introduced the genre with his song \"Letkajenkka\". A Swedish band called the Adventurers recorded it, and it immediately topped the charts in Finland. Later Jan Rohde, a Norwegian artist, recorded a version with lyrics with the bands the Adventurers and the Wild Ones.\n\nHalf a year later Rauno Lehtinen followed with his song \"Letkis\". This has become by far the most popular of all songs in the Letkajekka genre. It was first recorded by his studio orchestra Rautalanka Oy in August 1963, but was made popular in the October of the same year by a group called Ronnie Krank's Orchestra. His chart topper has been re-recorded approximately a hundred times, and the rights to at least 60 versions of the song are owned by Swedish publisher Stig Anderson. One well known recording of the song is by German musician Roberto Delgado.\n\nFor versions in other languages, Lehtinen's Letkis was renamed Letkiss, Let's Kiss, Lasst uns Küssen etc., for easier pronunciation in different languages. The name Letkis has nothing to do with kissing; the idea of kissing was introduced by non-Finnish speakers, who thought that the title of the song sounded like \"kissing\". In Finnish Letkis is merely short for Letkajenkka, a diminutive formed by the beginning of the word and adding \"is\" in the end.\n\nLehtinen's Letkis made the charts in many European countries, in Latin America, and even in Japan. There are numerous translations including Russian, Swedish, and Japanese. In 1965, four instrumental versions of the tune reached number one in the Netherlands simultaneously. These were by Stig Rauno, Gudrun Jankis, The Wild Ones and the Dutch Swing College Band. All four versions had the English title \"Letkiss\" rather than the original Finnish title. It remained the only Dutch number one to have originated from Finland until 2000, when \"Freestyler\" by the Bomfunk MC's reached number one.\n\nThe steps of Letkajenkka are like the steps of Bunny Hop, a novelty dance from the 1950s. It has been proposed that exchange students returning from the United States to Finland would have imported the steps of the Bunny Hop to Finland, as they had seen them on the TV show Bandstand. Whereas the Bunny Hop starts with a right foot lead, the Letkajenkka transformed into a dance based on the same step, but starting with a left leg lead. This can be seen from the early recordings for TV and in some movies made during the hottest craze. Also many translated lyrics include advice on the steps: \"left kick, left kick, right kick, right kick, forward jump, backward jump, hop, hop, hop\".\n\nThe people participating in the dance form a Conga-like line (that can also be a circle) so that everyone holds the person in front of themselves by the shoulders or the waist. The steps go as follows (everybody does the same thing):\n\n1–4 may be enhanced by bouncing with the leg opposite to the kicking side.\n\nThe music genre became popular, and many composers around the world started writing letkis music. Examples of non-Finnish letkis music include \"La Yenka\" (performed by Johnny & Charley Kurt, 1965), Gemelle Kessler's \"Lasciati Baciare Col Letkis\", \"Leaf Fall\" () by David Tukhmanov and \"Ploem Ploem Jenka\" by . Lindström's Letkajenkka was translated and covered in Japanese as Retto Kisu (Jenka) / レット・キス（ジェンカ）, performed by Kyu Sakamoto.\n\nIn Finland, the most well-known letkajenkka songs include\n\n\nThe movie \"Jamboree66\" (Sampaguita Pictures, Philippines, 1966, directed by Luciano B. Carlos) features a scene where the song \"Letkis\" is being played at a club.\n\nThere are at least two Letkajenkkas by Mimis Plessas that appear in the Greek movie \"Mia Trelli, Trelli Oikogeneia\" (Crazy, crazy family) that is directed by Dinos Dimopoulos (). There is a scene with people dancing around the pool. The steps are not strictly Jenkka, but the music is in the style of letkis. In another scene, Katerina Gogou and Alekos Tzanetakos are dancing a Letkajenkka variation as a couple to Letkis music. The choreography is John Flery's.\n\nIn the Hungarian movie \"Patyolat akció\" (1965), Mari Törőcsik and Gyula Bodrogi perform letkajenkka. The dance also appears in the Polish film \"Małżeństwo z rozsądku\" from 1966 (en. \"Marriage of Convenience\").\n\n\n"}

It was originally intended to air on Nickelodeon on August 22, 1992 (alongside its sister episode \"Ren's Toothache\"), however it was ultimately pulled before airing. It eventually aired on TNN on June 23, 2003. In this episode, Ren and Stimpy are adopted by George Liquor, who wants to make them champions.\n\nThe episode was deemed controversial for the violent scene where Ren beats George with an oar, along with tobacco references, and Nickelodeon refused to carry it in its original form, terminating series creator John Kricfalusi and his production company Spümcø from further involvement in the series at the time.\n\nOne day, George Liquor is standing outside of a pet store, watching Ren and Stimpy sleep in the window and gets the idea to adopt them as his pets. Upon arriving home, he introduces them to their new abode: a fish bowl from which the fish was rudely thrown out (and stole George's car as a result). The next day Ren and Stimpy awaken to find George Liquor dressed as a drill sergeant to train them to be proper pets. Their first lesson is house training by doing butt-push-ups on a newspaper. Ren fails, but Stimpy easily does his business while reading about mudslides. He is given a cigar-shaped dog treat as a reward. Next they are taught discipline. To learn discipline, first they have to learn to disobey. George Liquor tells them NOT to go anywhere near the couch, then instructs them to do just that so they can be punished. When he begins to become enraged by them not following his orders, Ren freaks out and collapses to the floor sobbing, and a terrified Stimpy hurls himself onto the couch as George had instructed, only to be yelled at. Stimpy is scared, thinking he is going to be punished. Instead, George compliments him for following orders and gives him another dog treat. Then George asks Ren to ask him for punishment. But George insists that Ren is too \"soft\" for punishment and instead gives him 20 dollars and tells him to take the car and see a movie as well. Ren points out that the fish already took the car and it looks like George is going to be enraged. Instead, he gives Ren another 20 dollars for being a smart mouth.\n\nLastly, he teaches them go to protect their \"master\". But before they learn to defend, they have to learn to attack. Wearing a padded suit, he urges the two of them to attack him. Stimpy refuses because George is his \"kind and beloved master\", but Ren, who is sick of George Liquor and their treatment, picks up an oar and maniacally begins beating him up with it, much to Stimpy's horror. Again, Ren expects George to be enraged. Instead, he is impressed and calls him a champion and produces cigar-shaped treats for all of them. The episode ends with the three of them dancing with the cigar-shaped treats clamped between their teeth.\n\nProduced from the show's second season, the story for the episode was written by the storyboard artist, Vincent Waller and series creator John Kricfalusi who also served as the episode's director and was scheduled to air on Nickelodeon in 1992, but the channel refused to air it due to one violent scene in which Ren beats up George with an oar, as well as references to tobacco. Following the episode's ban, Nickelodeon fired John Kricfalusi and the rest of Spümcø in order to make the show appropriate for younger viewers according to John K. himself. Following this also, handled the show starting with its third season, with Billy West, Stimpy's voice actor, replacing Kricfalusi's role as the voice of Ren.\n\nHowever, Kricfalusi was hired for Viacom years later, creating the short-lived \"Ren & Stimpy \"Adult Party Cartoon\"\" for the Spike TV network as part of its animation block, releasing the banned episode on the channel.\n\nThe episode was released on \"Ren & Stimpy\"'s first and second season boxset, as a bonus feature, and was later released for \"The Lost Episodes\" DVD.\n"}

In 1967, Lang left NYU and moved to Coconut Grove, Florida to open a head shop. In 1968, after promoting a series of concert events in the Miami area, Lang (together with Marshall Brevetz) produced the \"1968 Miami Pop Festival\". It drew around 25,000 people on day one (May 18) with acts such as Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, John Lee Hooker, Arthur Brown, and Blue Cheer. On the afternoon of the second day (May 19) it started to rain and the event ended early. \n\nAfter he moved to Woodstock, NY and met Artie Kornfeld in New York, the two developed the concept for a major festival event to celebrate the '60s social movements, and planned to open a recording studio in the town of Woodstock. With Kornfeld and partners John P. Roberts and Joel Rosenman, Lang set into motion the Woodstock festival, which was held on Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel, New York, from August 15 to August 18, 1969.\n\nMichael Lang was featured in many scenes of the 1970 Academy Award winning documentary film \"Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music\".\n\nLang also produced Woodstock '94 with partners Roberts, Rosenman and co-producer John Scher, and Woodstock '99 with John Scher and Ossie Kilkenny.\n\nIn May 2014, Lang revealed plans for a possible 50th anniversary concert in 2019 and that he is exploring various locations.\n\nLang was not among the producers of the December 6, 1969, Altamont Free Concert which some had billed as a \"Woodstock West\", but was asked by the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to assist with the last-moment re-location, from Sears Point Raceway to the Altamont Speedway, near Tracy, CA. The concert was initially planned for Golden Gate Park, and was to feature The Rolling Stones, Grateful Dead, Santana, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers, and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. The City of San Francisco revoked the permits for the Golden Gate venue, ostensibly due to a San Francisco 49ers football game at Kezar Stadium, located in the park, on the scheduled date. The concert was subsequently moved to Sears Point Raceway. However, a dispute over film rights led to its cancellation. Lang and Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully were then offered the Altamont Speedway – a rival to Sears Point Raceway – by owner Dick Carter. After the venue was set for the concert, Lang appeared, with his experience in moving the much larger Woodstock festival. The venue was moved on December 4 to the racetrack with the concert starting December 6.\n\nThe venue change created major technical problems, including a stage built too low and close to the fans. The Hells Angels were then hired for stage security, which resulted in numerous fights with concertgoers, as well as an on-stage altercation with members of the Jefferson Airplane, in which singer Marty Balin was struck and knocked unconscious. Audience member Meredith Hunter was stabbed and killed when he rushed the stage with a gun while The Rolling Stones were performing. These incidents were captured on film and appear in the Maysles Brothers documentary film \"Gimme Shelter\". There were also three accidental deaths among the crowd of 300,000.\n\nLang is also seen in the film. He last appears on-stage, seen walking away during the Hells Angels/Jefferson Airplane scuffle on the stage.\n\nLang owned and operated Just Sunshine Records, which produced and released more than 40 albums by such diverse musical artists as Karen Dalton, Betty Davis and Mississippi Fred McDowell. Lang also managed several successful international recording artists, including Joe Cocker, Rickie Lee Jones, Willie DeVille, Tarkan, and Spanish recording artists El Ultimo de la Fila. The label was active and distributed by Gulf & Western's Famous Music Group from 1971 until 1974.\n\nLang was associate producer of Wes Anderson's 1996 film \"Bottle Rocket\". The Michael Lang Organization (MLO) encompasses live event production, film production and artist management. Current projects include a 50th anniversary event for the Lincoln Center featuring the French Theater company Royal Delux, a 40th anniversary event for Woodstock in summer 2009, a movie version of the cult classic novel, \"The Master and Margarita\" and theater projects in Turkey and South Korea. Additionally, with his partners in Woodstock Ventures, Lang is developing future projects which include a Broadway musical based on Woodstock the musical and a Woodstock lifestyle brand.\n\nIn August 2005, MLO produced a sold out Festival event for Heineken at Randall’s Island called AmsterJam which featured mash ups from artists such as Snoop Dogg, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Wyclef Jean.\n\nMLO also has worked with the following artists: Outkast, Prince, Missy Elliott, Snoop Dogg, Steely Dan, The Fugees, Wyclef Jean, Tarkan, Shakira, Madonna, Norah Jones, Marc Anthony, Twista, Dave Matthews, Bruce Springsteen, Alicia Keys, Kid Rock, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Christina Aguilera, Linkin Park, Avril Lavigne, and Joe Cocker.\n\nIn 2009, Woodstock Ventures (Michael Lang, Joel Rosenman, and the John Roberts estate) formed joint venture with Sony Music Entertainment and launched a new woodstock.com. The site celebrates the history of the original Woodstock Festivals.\n\nIn the 2009 Ang Lee film, \"Taking Woodstock\", Michael Lang is played by stage/TV actor Jonathan Groff.\n\nIn 2009 Lang wrote the critically acclaimed NY Times Bestseller \"The Road to Woodstock\" with Holly George Warren.\n\n"}

Balieff (c.1873– 3 September 1936), was a Jewish Russian Armenian born vaudevillian, stage performer, writer, impresario, and director. He is best known as the creator and master of ceremonies of \"La Chauve-Souris\" theater group.\n\nBalieff is believed to have been born in Erzerum, Ottoman Empire in 1873, he left for Moscow in 1906 and took a job at the Moscow Art Theater under Konstantin Stanislavski. After years of only non-speaking roles, and with a desire to perform comedy rather than drama, Balieff co-created (among with Nikolai Tarasov) his own theater group in a basement near the Moscow Art Theater. He named the troupe \"La Chauve-Souris\" (French for \"bat\") after a bat flew up out of the basement door and landed on his hat.\n\nChauve-Souris enjoyed much success and popularity in Moscow, until the Russian Revolution in 1917. Balieff then went into exile in Paris and began presenting vaudeville shows there with other Russian émigrés. He was noticed by the British theatrical producer Charles B. Cochran, who brought the troupe to London.\n\nIn 1922 Chauve-Souris made its first tour to America through an arrangement with the producer Morris Gest. Balieff and his company toured from Washington, D.C. to California for 65 consecutive weeks. Between 1922 and 1929, Balieff returned to America to tour six times, appearing on Broadway in 1922, 1923, 1925, 1927, and 1929, with one final show billed as \"New Chauve-Souris\" in 1931. His shows consisted of songs, dances, and sketches, most of which had been originally performed in Russia.\n\nOne of his most popular acts, \"The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\", which used the Leon Jessel tune \"Die Parade der Zinnsoldaten\" (\"The Parade of the Tin Soldiers\"), referenced a story regarding Tsar Paul I. The legend claims the Tsar left his parade grounds without issuing a \"halt\" order to the marching soldiers. Without one, the soldiers marched to Siberia before being remembered and ordered back. The Balieff vaudeville version with its popular tune was a mainstay in Chauve-Souris, and later became part of The Rockettes repertoire as well. \"Wooden Soldiers\" was filmed in the DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process, and premiered on 15 April 1923 at the Rivoli Theater in New York City, along with 18 other short films made by DeForest. This short film is located in the Maurice Zouary collection at the Library of Congress. \n\nBalieff was known for his feigned lack of English on stage. His monologues and introductions were delivered in a mix of Russian, French, and English language and slang coupled with much gesticulation. However, in private his English was better than that of his stage persona. His company toured Europe and South Africa, appearing in major capital cities. He was married to Helena Komisarjevska, a member of one of his theatrical companies. In 1927 he was featured on the cover of \"Time\" magazine. \n\nIn 1934 Balieff created a new Chauve-Souris production, which proved to be his last theatrical venture. The fall of that year marked his final stage appearance: Continental Varieties, a revue at the Helen Hayes Theatre, which featured Lucienne Boyer. He also appeared in the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur film, \"Once in a Blue Moon\" (1935).\n\nBalieff died of a kidney ailment on 3 September 1936, aged 63, at the Park West Hospital on West 76th Street in Manhattan. His funeral was held at the Russian Orthodox Church of Christ the Savior on Madison Avenue. Members of the Russian Opera Company sang and nearly 1,000 people attended the service, including members of the Russian nobility. Balieff is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery, Maspeth, Queens, New York. His caricature was drawn by Alex Gard for the famed Sardi's Restaurant, where well-known performers often congregated during the Broadway season, and where many well-known stage actors' caricatures hang. The signed drawing is now housed in the Billy Rose Theatre Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.\n\n"}

According to its founding name, the organization is mainly a network for theatre designers, theatre architects and theatre technicians around the world, made up of people associated with creating or studying live performances, including educators, researchers and practitioners. The organization has members from 53 countries, in the membership categories: Centre Member, Associate Member and Individual Member.\n\nThe predecessor of the organization was the scenography section of the International Theatre Institute (ITI), founded in 1948. This institute was expected to form an international co-operation of all artistic fields and establish leading publishing and educational direction from the drama sections. The project failed, but interest in the visual elements of theatre grew. Shortly after, in 1958, the International Association of Theatre Technicians (IATT) was formed in Paris. This association also faltered due to lack of direction, programming, organizational structure, administrative and financial provisions.\n\nThe representatives sought ITI to take up the activities again, and the ITI Secretary General Jean Darcante went to Prague in 1967 to discuss with representatives of the Czechoslovak National ITI Center, the Theatre Institute and the Institute of Scenography, the possibility of establishing an organization with a general secretariat in Prague. Czechoslovak scenographers, including professional workers and theatre specialists from both institutions, prepared a draft program for the activity of the new organization with the Czechoslovak Ministry of Culture. Darcante travelled to Prague again in early 1968 to obtain a binding promise from the Czechoslovak official authorities and agree the final details with the Theatre Institute and the Institute of Scenography. On 7 and 8 June 1968, the foundation committee met to establish the new International Organization of Scenographers and Theatre Technicians (; OISTT). The founding membership consisted of representatives from Czechoslovakia, Canada, Israel, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States.\n\nOISTAT is composed of members in regions around the world, known as OISTAT Centres, Associate members and Individual members. As defined in the Statutes, \"the directing body of OISTAT is the Congress, which is formed when the delegates of the OISTAT Centres, Associate Members and Individual Members are assembled in plenary session\". Every four years, the delegates of the World Congress elect the President and the members of Executive Committee. They also decide on changes in the Statutes and other arising issues of the organization.\n\nOISTAT affairs are coordinated by the Governing Board and its Executive Committee. The Executive Committee consists of eight elected members including the President, elected at the congress. The Governing Board consists of the elected chairs of the six commissions.\n\nThe Headquarters, known as the Secretariat until 2011, are the only constant office of the organization in charge of daily communications, and serve as the central network for its members and commissions. The Headquarters has moved twice since its foundation; it was in Prague from 1968-1993, in the Netherlands from 1993-2005, and since 2006 it is in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nSix commissions lead various projects in their field of studies: \n\n\nTheatre Architecture Competition is an international ideas competition, aimed at students and emerging practitioners, which is organized every four years by the Architecture commission. The sites of the competition have been in these cities:\n\nIn 2011, the competition theme was to design a theatre for a specific performance. The theatre can be in 'found' spaces which were not previously or presently a performing space or create a temporary installation.\n\nIn 2015, the theme was to construct a 'floating theatre' on Spree River in Berlin, Germany. The competition has moved from Prague Quadrennial to Berlin's Stage|Set|Scenery.\n\nIn 2017, the theme is 'Theatre as Public Space'. The aim of the competition is to challenge the conventional typology of the theatre and to focus on the design of a temporary theatre (or theatres) in The Public Activity Center, a disused sports stadium in Hsinchu City in Taiwan. The 25 selected entries of TAC 2017 were exhibited and awarded during 2017 World Stage Design on July 1–9, 2017 in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nWorld Stage Design is an international exhibition of performance design from theatre, dance, music, and opera, as well as a showcase for cross-disciplinary performances and installations in non-conventional theatre spaces since 2005. It is held every four years on different continents, to purposely show the latest designs in theatre performances. Different from the Prague Quadrennial which presents designs curated by each country, World Stage Design allows every individual designer to submit design works directly to the curatorial panel for the grand exhibition.

It provides seminars, workshops, thematic exhibitions, performances, and presentations, with the aim of engaging students and professionals in the field of theatre design. Since 2013, Scenofest has formed new connections with World Stage Design.\n\nTechnical Invention Prize (TIP) is a global competition organized by OISTAT Technology commission. TIP awards technicians who come up with simple and smart solutions to the works in theatre or entertainment industry. Those clever ideas are mostly realized by inexpensive means and materials. The first Technical Invention Prize was initiated in 2011. In 2017, the second TIP was held along with the World Stage Design 2017 in Taipei, Taiwan. The selected entries for the competition are published in the TIP catalogue for the reference of theatre professionals.\n\n\n"}

His brother, Angelo, formed an opera company in Prague around 1732, consisting of 3 male singers and 5 females; Pietro quickly followed suit, and the two troupes achieved Europe-wide success (though mostly in German and Austrian cities), sometimes performing together. Pietro's company, the more high-profile of the two, at times included Christoph Willibald Gluck and Giuseppe Sarti as members. Most of the works performed belonged to the genre of \"opera seria\", though \"opere buffe\" were also given.\n\nAfter performances at the coronation of Franz I at Frankfurt (Maria Theresa's husband) in 1745, and at a royal wedding at Dresden in 1747 (when Gluck's \"Le nozze d'Ercole e d'Ebe\", with the composer conducting, was performed), Mingotti's troupe were invited to Copenhagen by Queen Louise in the same year. The company's repertory for the Danish court included not only operas but also ballets. Sarti joined the troupe in December 1752 as music director after Gluck left during 1750. Severe financial difficulties forced Pietro to end his contract with the court at Copenhagen in 1755, and he died impoverished 4 years later in the Danish capital. Little is known of Angelo Mingotti's later career; from 1743 till 1751 the Oper am Gänsemarkt was used by Angelo Mingotti, performing Italian opera's.\n\n"}
{"id": "47432143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47432143", "title": "Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy", "text": "Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy\n\nIn 2015, an anti-abortion organization named the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) released several videos that had been secretly recorded. Members of the CMP posed as representatives of a biotechnology company in order to gain access to both meetings with abortion providers and abortion facilities. The videos showed how abortion providers made fetal tissue available to researchers, although no problems were found with the legality of the process. <section begin=\"lead\" />All of the videos were found to be altered, according to analysis by Fusion GPS and its co-founder Glenn R. Simpson, a former investigative reporter for \"The Wall Street Journal\". The CMP disputed this finding, attributing the alterations to the editing out of \"bathroom breaks and waiting periods.\" CMP continues to allege that the videos provide evidence that abortion providers profit from the sale of donated tissue. The videos attracted widespread media coverage, and after the release of the first video, conservative Congressional lawmakers singled out Planned Parenthood and began to push bills that would strip the organization of federal family planning funding. No such attempts by Congress to cut federal family planning money from Planned Parenthood have become law. Conservative politicians in several states have also used this as an opportunity to cut or attempt to cut family planning funding at the state level.\n\nOfficials in twelve states initiated investigations into claims made by the videos, but none found Planned Parenthood clinics to have sold tissue for profit as alleged by CMP and other anti-abortion groups. An investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee found no evidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. A select committee, the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood, was formed to further investigate Planned Parenthood. The Republican-controlled Select Investigative Panel released its final report on December 30, 2016, recommending that Planned Parenthood be defunded. The report was heavily criticized as partisan and inaccurate by Democratic members of the committee, Planned Parenthood, and some news media.\n\nOn January 25, 2016, a Texas grand jury indicted CMP founder David Daleiden and member Sandra Merritt, while finding no wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. The charges against Daleiden and Merritt in Texas were dismissed six months later. On March 28, 2017, Daleiden and Merritt were charged with 15 felonies in the State of California – one for each of the people whom they had filmed without consent, and one for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy. On June 21, 2017, all the invasion of privacy charges (but not that of conspiracy) were dismissed with leave to amend. Soon after, the State of California re-filed amended charges.<section end=\"lead\" />\n\nThe CMP videos consisted of portions of secretly recorded, hours-long conversations between members of CMP and abortion providers. Members of CMP posed as representatives of a non-existent company called Biomax Procurement Services, presenting themselves as potential buyers of fetal tissue. CMP claims that it has \"hundreds if not thousands of hours of recordings\".\n\nThe videos were made over a period of 30 months, and were released approximately once per week to increase exposure, including media coverage, and to allow the public more time to consume and react to each video. Americans United for Life began working with CMP beginning in January 2015, providing them with advice. There were widespread protests at Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) affiliates. The debate over abortion was reinvigorated.\n\nOne of the videos includes an image of a stillborn fetus, published in the \"Daily Mail\" in January 2014, used without the permission of the woman in the photo, and in a way that falsely suggests that the stillborn was aborted.\n\nCMP claimed the videos were evidence of Planned Parenthood engaging in the illegal sale of fetal tissue. Their dummy corporation Biomax offered one clinic for tissue, but the affiliate declined the offer. \"The New York Times\" has characterized the offer as an attempt to \"trap the affiliate in the act of accepting a high payment for fetal tissue\".\n\nIn a less-edited version of the first video, PPFA staff repeatedly state that the organization makes no money from tissue donations, and that the $30100 charge only covers procurement costs. PPFA have said they may donate fetal tissue at the request of a patient, but such tissue is never sold. At one point in the video, a PPFA staffer states \"nobody should be 'selling' tissue,\" and \"that's just not the goal here.\"\n\nAccording to several experts in the field, the money Planned Parenthood received for fetal tissue was too little to make any profit for Planned Parenthood and constituted reasonable compensation for the costs of procurement, as allowed by federal law. These experts included Sherilyn J. Sawyer, the director of Harvard University's and Brigham and Women's Hospital's biorepository; Jim Vaught, president of the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories and formerly the deputy director of the National Cancer Institute's (NCIs) Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research; and Carolyn Compton, the chief medical and science officer of Arizona State University's National Biomarkers Development Alliance and a former director of biorepositories and biospecimen research at the NCI.\n\nOn October 13, 2015, Planned Parenthood announced it would no longer accept reimbursement for the costs of collecting and shipping fetal tissue to research labs. Citing an \"anti-abortion agenda\" by some in Congress, Planned Parenthood stated the move was designed to remove a reason for politically motivated attacks.\n\nThe CMP alleges that the videos show Planned Parenthood officials offering to make adjustments in the techniques used in abortions in order to acquire more intact fetal tissues and organs. Federal law prohibits changing from one abortion procedure to another procedure in order to obtain human tissue for medical research, as well as for delivering intact fetuses. Planned Parenthood spokespeople have responded to CMP's allegations by stating that the organization follows \"all lawsperiod,\" and that accusations made in CMP's videos \"are false\".\n\nIn the sixth video, Holly O'Donnell, a pro-life former StemExpress technician, says that she was told by her superiors to encourage women seeking abortions to sign the consent forms, and that even when women refused to sign the fetal organs and tissues were sometimes taken anyway. In the unedited first video, representatives claim the donations are only made with the patient's consent. StemExpress, a supplier of biological specimens mostly stem cells for research, has \"unequivocally\" denied O'Donnell's allegation, stating that the video is \"deceptively edited and falsely worded to suggest impropriety or illegality where none exists\". Eric Ferrero, vice president of communication for the PPFA, noted that O'Donnell \"has never worked for Planned Parenthood\", and called her claims \"false and outrageous.\"\n\nThe editorial board of \"The New York Times\" described CMP's actions as a \"campaign of deception against Planned Parenthood\", and wrote that the \"video campaign is a dishonest attempt to make legal, voluntary and potentially lifesaving tissue donations appear nefarious and illegal\". Supporters of Planned Parenthood have complained that the videos were \"highly edited,\" although the CMP has released unedited videos along with the much shorter edited versions. Defending the release of the videos in the \"Washington Post\", columnist Charles Krauthammer said \"these revelations will have an effect on public perceptions [...] by throwing open the door to the backroom where [the developing infant \"in utero\"] is destroyed\".\n\nCecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, \"personally [apologized] for the staff member's tone and statements\", saying the videos were \"unacceptable\". Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of PPFA, stated: \"The latest [fifth] tape has at least 20 substantial and unexplained edits. Previous tapes released by this extremist group were 'heavily edited' in order to distort what was actually said. These videos are intended to shock and deceive the public.\" In a letter to a Congressional committee, PPFA wrote: \"A group of extremists who have intimidated women and doctors for yearsin their agenda to ban abortion completelyare not 'documenting' misdeeds; they are trying to create them, quite unsuccessfully.\"\n\nIn response to Planned Parenthood, CMP stated that \"we look forward to showing the public more clear evidence that Planned Parenthood routinely profits from the sale of baby parts and changes the abortion procedures it uses on pregnant women in order to do so\".\n\nResponding to the videos and to CMP's claims, three different Congressional committees, and officials in a number of states, launched investigations into Planned Parenthood's tissue collection activities. One Congressional committee asked to interview the filmed representatives to see whether the statements made in the videos are consistent with existing federal law.\n\nOn July 30, 2015, former Indiana Governor Mike Pence announced that the state's investigation did not find any evidence of wrongdoing in Planned Parenthood's handling of fetal tissue. In Massachusetts, where there is no fetal tissue and organ donation program, Attorney General Maura Healey found that aborted fetuses are disposed of properly in a report that \"voiced strong support for\" Planned Parenthood. In Florida, investigators from the Agency for Health Care Administration found on July 31, 2015 that three Planned Parenthood clinics were performing second-trimester abortions without the proper licenses, and that one clinic was failing to keep proper logs relating to fetal remains. Planned Parenthood rejected the findings.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott announced an investigation into practices in Texas, and said that the state would \"expand its investigation\" after the release of the second video, and Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster announced that his office would investigate Planned Parenthood for any potential wrongdoing at its clinics in that state. Investigations were also launched in Ohio, Kansas, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana, with calls for the U.S. Justice Department to investigate.\n\nAt the local level, the Harris County district attorney launched a criminal investigation in conjunction with the Texas Rangers and the Houston Police Department after the fifth video was released showing a Planned Parenthood executive in that city.\n\nAltogether, the videos prompted investigations in fifteen states, including Texas where the sting operation took place; eight other states refused to investigate their Planned Parenthood clinics, including California and Colorado where CMP sting operations also occurred.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Kamala D. Harris announced an investigation into the CMP's practice of undercover recording.\n\nOfficials in Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, South Dakota, and Kansas investigated and failed to find any evidence of Planned Parenthood clinics breaking any state laws concerning the collection of fetal tissues. The state of Pennsylvania cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing. In September, the Missouri Attorney General found no evidence that the state's only clinic that provides abortion services mishandled fetal tissues. The report stated, \"As a result of our investigation, the Office of the Missouri Attorney General has found no evidence that (Planned Parenthood) has engaged in unlawful disposal of fetal organs and tissue.\"\n\nOn October 8, 2015, Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz (Utah), chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stated that the GOP investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood.\n\nOn January 25, 2016, a Houston grand jury indicted Daleiden and another videographer, Sandra Merritt, but declined to charge Planned Parenthood. On July 26, 2016, the charges against Daleiden and Merritt in Texas were dismissed. On March 28, 2017, however, Daleiden and Merritt were charged with 15 felonies in the State of California – one for each of the people whom they had filmed without consent, and one for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.\n\nA select committee, the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood, was formed to further investigate Planned Parenthood, with Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn serving as the chairman. On September 21, the panel voted 8–0 to recommend holding StemExpress in contempt of Congress for failure to comply with a subpoena. The six Democratic members of the panel walked out of the meeting in protest before the vote. The committee's final report recommended that \"the National Institutes of Health be required to stop funding fetal tissue research, and that the huge health provider Planned Parenthood be stripped of U.S. funding.\" According to \"Science\", the report contained multiple inaccuracies. Democratic members of the panel - who had not been permitted to read, respond to, or vote on the final report - released an alternate report, in which they criticized the committee for relying on \"McCarthy-era tactics\" and of relying on \"unsourced, unverified documents\" in writing the report. A Planned Parenthood spokesperson described the report as \"nothing more than a partisan attack on Planned Parenthood and women's access to safe and legal abortion\" and noted that 13 state-level investigations and other congressional inquiries had found no wrongdoing. The \"Washington Post,\" \"New York Magazine\" and \"Los Angeles Times\" described the panel's inquiry as a \"witch hunt\" and criticized both its findings and tactics in editorials.\n\nOn July 31, 2015, the National Abortion Federation sued CMP and Daleiden. A Los Angeles judge placed a temporary restraining order on the release of further videos of employees of StemExpress, one company which Planned Parenthood does business with, based on California's anti-wiretapping law. The order also prohibited the group from disclosing names or addresses of National Abortion Federation members, or dates and locations of future meetings. The restraining order was later lifted, allowing release of more videos. A hearing was held on August 27, 2015.\n\nCMP has said that it follows \"all applicable laws.\" Daleiden has stated that, in the suppressed video, the \"top leadership\" of StemExpress \"admitted that they sometimes get fully intact fetuses shipped to their laboratory from the abortion clinics that they work with and that could be \"prima facie\" evidence of born-alive infants\". StemExpress has denied Daleiden's \"intact fetuses\" claims:\n\nStemExpress CEO Cate Dyer explained the discrepancy as a misuse of terms by CMP operatives:\n\nStemExpress has severed ties with Planned Parenthood as a result of the controversy, stating that their business with Planned Parenthood was a small percentage of their activities.\n\nIn September 2015, two courts ruled that Daleiden and CMP must turn over private documents and submit to depositions about how they orchestrated their video sting, and could require Daleiden to turn over paperwork and details of the operation, and provide the full raw footage he collected while posing as an executive of the fictitious tissue procurement firm Biomax. On December 4, 2015, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy ruled on an emergency appeal from the CMP. The CMP's appeal had asked the Justice to block the lower courts' order that would require CMP to release the names of its donors. Justice Kennedy denied the appeal.\n\nIn August 2015, StemExpress cut all ties with Planned Parenthood for the procurement of human fetal tissue, which has had a severe impact on medical researchers. StemExpress was one of the main providers of human fetal tissue along with Advanced Biosciences Resources. According to a congressional report, research into the Zika virus has been stalled along with investigations into Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, diabetes, and childhood leukemia. Science Friday aired a segment about Dr. Eugene Gu, one of the fetal tissue researchers subpoenaed by Congress. Gu studies congenital heart and kidney diseases in infants but has since placed his research on hold after United States Marshals delivered the subpoena to his Nashville apartment, which is in proximity to Marsha Blackburn and Diane Black.\n\nThis is in spite of broad support for fetal tissue research by the scientific community. \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" (NEJM) published an editorial in support of Planned Parenthood's \"efforts to channel fetal tissue into important medical research\". The editorial argued that many medical advances would not have been made without fetal tissue research and that \"Planned Parenthood, its physicians, and the researchers who do this work should be praised, not damned.\" The NEJM described CMP's actions as a \"campaign of misinformation\" and said that it is shameful that CMP \"continues to twist the facts to achieve its ends\". In addition, the NEJM praised Planned Parenthood's contributions to women's health care and stated that the \"contraception services that Planned Parenthood delivers may be the single greatest effort to prevent the unwanted pregnancies that result in abortions\".\n\nThe videos were shown to several pro-life congresspeople, including Diane Black, Trent Franks, and Tim Murphy, weeks before being made publicly available. Black said that she was given advance screening of the videos, which \"literally made [her] sick to [her] stomach\" as well as \"emotional and tearful\", so that she would be prepared to comment on them after their release.\n\nThe timing of the first video led commentators to speculate it may have been released to coincide with a bill to raise money for Susan G. Komen for the Cure, which gives funding to Planned Parenthood. After the first video was released, Rand Paul and Diane Black introduced pre-prepared legislation to discontinue federal funding of Planned Parenthood.\n\nOn July 14, 2015, House Speaker John Boehner ordered congressional hearings into the practice procuring fetal tissues and organs by Planned Parenthood, and at least one committee committed to scheduling a hearing. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has said that Planned Parenthood's practices \"should be looked into.\"\n\nOn August 3, 2015, the legislation failed to pass in the Senate with 53 supporting discontinuing funding and 46 opposed. This was seven votes short of the 60 needed to pass the bill.\n\nOn September 18, 2015, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 241187 to defund Planned Parenthood for one year, allowing time to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. The vote is largely symbolic because the bill is not expected to pass in the Senate and President Obama has stated he would veto legislation to defund Planned Parenthood. Some have raised the issue that this kind of congressional vote could violate the United States Constitution, which prohibits bills of attainder, which refers to lawmakers punishing an individual or organization based on alleged infractions without a finding of guilt by a court.\n\nOn October 7, 2015, The U.S. House of Representatives created the House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives led by Marsha Blackburn. The Panel states that its mission \"is to gather information and get the facts about medical practices of abortion service providers and the business practices of the procurement organizations who sell baby body parts.\" \n\nSeveral Republican presidential candidates repeated CMP's allegations that PPFA used tissue donation as a way to profit from abortion. Rick Perry said \"The video showing a Planned Parenthood employee selling the body parts of aborted children is a disturbing reminder of the organization's penchant for profiting off the tragedy of a destroyed human life\", and cited the videos as the reason why Planned Parenthood should lose federal funding. Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul posted on Twitter \"...a video showing Planned Parenthood's top doctor describing how she performs late-term abortions to sell body parts for profit\", vowed to campaign to defund Planned Parenthood, and called for Hillary Clinton to return Planned Parenthood's donations to her campaign.\n\nCarly Fiorina said \"This latest news is tragic and outrageous. This isn't about 'choice'. It's about profiting on the death of the unborn while telling women it's about empowerment\". During the September 16, 2015, GOP presidential candidates' debate on \"CNN\", she harshly criticized Planned Parenthood and their involvement in fetal tissue donation, stating \"I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, 'We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain'\". The website \"PolitiFact.com\", however, said the video footage Fiorina referred to was not obtained from a Planned Parenthood clinic, but was stock footage of an unrelated live fetus, obtained from the Grantham Collection, \"an organization that hopes to stem abortion by promoting graphic images of the procedure\". It was then added by CMP to dramatize the description by StemExpress procurement technician Holly O'Donnell. In the edited video, O'Donnell alleged that while she was working in a pathology lab at a Planned Parenthood clinic, her supervisor told her that they would procure a brain from a well preserved fetus. O'Donnell said: \"I'm sitting here looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don't know what to think.\" \"The New York Times\" reported that \"while the authenticity of the videos remains a subject of debate, Mrs. Fiorina appears to have exaggerated their contents\", and \"PolitiFact.com\" rated Fiorina's statement \"mostly false\".\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who \"staunchly defended\" the organization, said that the videos were \"disturbing\" and called for a national investigation into the sale of aborted fetal tissue. The White House said it would oppose any congressional attempts to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal announced, on August 3, 2015, that the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals was terminating its contract with Planned Parenthood, which provides the organization with state Medicaid funds. In court filings, the Justice Department argued that Louisiana's action violates federal law by denying Medicaid patients the choice of their healthcare providers. Also noted, neither of the two Louisiana clinics provide abortion services. The states of Alabama, New Hampshire, and Utah also cut their respective funding to Planned Parenthood in the wake of the videos, while Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were considering similar measures. The Obama administration has warned state legislators it may be illegal to cut funding to Planned Parenthood.\n\nAfter consulting with the university's Bioethics Advisory Committee, Colorado State University president Tony Frank suspended the further purchase of fetal tissue for research purposes.\n\nOn November 27, 2015, a gunman shot and killed two civilians and a police officer during a five-hour gun battle at the Colorado Springs clinic. The 57-year-old gunman surrendered to police and was taken into custody. During his arrest, he gave a rambling interview in which, at one point, he said \"no more baby parts,\" an apparent reference to protests against the clinic, echoing language used in the news media about the clinic. However, authorities could not clearly identify a specific motivation.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch called the shooting a \"crime against women receiving health care services\". Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers said that the shooting and standoff \"certainly appears\" to be an act of domestic terrorism.\n\nVicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation drew particular attention to the videos, two of which were filmed at a clinic in Denver, north of Colorado Springs; these videos resulted in a number of threats against one doctor featured in the videos, who had to move out of her home and hire 24-hour security as a result according to Saporta.\n\nThe CMP issued a statement condemning the shooting as a \"barbaric killing spree\" by a \"violent madman\".\n\nIn March 2017, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra charged Daleiden and Merritt with 15 felonies related to the videos, including one count of conspiracy to invade privacy and 14 counts of filming people without permission in Los Angeles. In response, Daleiden issued a statement calling the charges \"bogus\" and pledged to release more videos. The editorial board of the \"Los Angeles Times\" published an editorial stating that while they disagreed with the CMP's cause and methods, the filing of criminal charges by Becerra was a \"disturbingly aggressive\" action against people \"trying to influence a contested issue of public policy.\" On June 21, 2017, all the invasion of privacy charges (but not that of conspiracy) were dismissed with leave to amend. Soon after, the State of California re-filed the charges, amended.\n\nIn December 2016, Senator Chuck Grassley referred Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for investigation. In the fall of 2017, the FBI made a request to the Senate Judiciary Committee for access to un-redacted comments obtained from abortion providers.\n"}
{"id": "28369708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28369708", "title": "Pre-certification video", "text": "Pre-certification video\n\nA pre-certification video is any videotape (or laserdisc) issued in the UK before the introduction of the 1984 Video Recordings Act.\n\nPre-certification videos were not required by law to be submitted to the BBFC so the era was unregulated, leading to many uncut releases of videos which would have fallen foul of the BBFC's strict guidelines, and would therefore have been censored if submission to the board was a legal requirement. However, whilst many of the larger respectable companies simply issued their previously BBFC certificated cinema releases onto video to play safe as they feared there was bound to be a clampdown at some stage, some of the smaller independent companies decided to take advantage of the unregulated video rentals market by issuing \"strong uncut\" versions depicting graphic violence and gore. A whole barrage of titles previously banned by the BBFC from getting a cinema release suddenly ended up uncensored on home video.\n\nWhat began as a bill drafted by little known Luton South Conservative back bencher Graham Bright was made law after he and the tabloid press (most notably The Daily Mail) had successfully whipped the media into a frenzied hysteria over so-called \"video nasties\". \"Ban the Sadist Videos!\" was one of the more famous headlines they ran. When the bill was made law it became a legal requirement that all videotapes must be submitted to the BBFC for classification and possible cuts.\n\nThe pre-certification video era is best remembered, amongst horror fans in particular, for the ensuing \"video nasty\" debacle in which a selection of 72 videotapes were singled out and prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) under Section 2 or Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act (OPA). Of these, 39 titles were deemed by the courts to be obscene and it's those titles which formed the final \"Video Nasties\" list.\n\nVideo releases from this unregulated pre-certification era have become increasingly collectible items. Whilst most can be picked up cheaply on eBay and through second hand stores and car boot sales, many titles are highly sought after. In fact some of the very hard to find titles have been known to command prices in excess of £500. There remains to this day a very dedicated pre-cert collector's market.\n\nIn 1984 the UK government introduced the Video Recordings Act which effectively meant that all pre-recorded videocassettes had to be officially classified by an independent body called the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) before they could legally be released in the United Kingdom. There were some exceptions to this, such as music, educational, documentary and religious programmes providing they contained no profanity, sexual or violent content. These could be released with an Exempt status. Everything else had to be classified - and the costs of getting a cassette classified were quite high!\n\nBefore the VRA (Video Recordings Act) came into force, videos were not subject to classification, certification or censorship by any official means (although some companies chose to implement their own, and of course the Obscene Publications Act (1959) meant hardcore pornography would have been swiftly and severely dealt with (at least if it was on ready display).\n\nThe Video Recordings Act left uncertified titles in limbo, and unless a distributor acquires them and releases them with a BBFC classification all titles fall under section 9 and 10 which states:-\n\nSection 9 Supplying video recording of unclassified work.\n\n(1) A person who supplies or offers to supply a video recording containing a video work in respect of which no classification certificate has been issued is guilty of an offence unless—.\n(a)the supply is, or would if it took place be, an exempted supply, or.\n(b)the video work is an exempted work.\n\n(2) It is a defence to a charge of committing an offence under this section to prove that the accused believed on reasonable grounds—.\n(a) that the video work concerned or, if the video recording contained more than one work to which the charge relates, each of those works was either an exempted work or a work in respect of which a classification certificate had been issued, or.\n(b) that the supply was, or would if it took place be, an exempted supply by virtue of section 3(4) or (5) of this Act..\n(3) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable—.\n(a) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or a fine or both.\n(b) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding £20,000 or both.]\n\nSection 10 Possession of video recording of unclassified work for the purposes of supply.\n(1)Where a video recording contains a video work in respect of which no classification certificate has been issued, a person who has the recording in his possession for the purpose of supplying it is guilty of an offence unless— \n(a) he has it in his possession for the purpose only of a supply which, if it took place, would be an exempted supply, or.\n(b) the video work is an exempted work\n\nThese years, from about 1978 until the classifications finally took hold good and proper in late 1985, became known as the pre-certification years.\n\n"}

The company was formed in 2008 by John Ledford, formerly of A.D. Vision.\n\nSome of Sentai's notable licensed anime series include \"Clannad\", \"K-On!\", \"Highschool of the Dead\", \"Angel Beats!\", \"Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions\", \"WataMote\", \"Akame ga Kill!\", \"Parasyte -the maxim-\", \"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\" and \"Made in Abyss\"; as well as the films \"\", \"Grave of the Fireflies\", \"Ninja Scroll\", \"The Garden of Words\" and \"Children Who Chase Lost Voices\".\n\nWhen asked by a fan on Facebook what the reason was for calling the company \"Sentai\", chief executive officer Matt Greenfield responded, \"It's a multi-layered pun, mostly for the benefit of the Japanese. Although Sentai can be translated as Squadron, Regiment or Flotilla, it basically means a team or group assembled with specific training and equipment for a specific purpose. Plus, Sentai was formed to help keep the anime industry alive in the U.S., so the superhero aspect is a double-play on that that Americans can get.\"\n\nBeginning in 2008, Sentai had started releasing their first titles, which included \"Clannad\", \"Princess Resurrection\", \"Indian Summer\", \"Appleseed\" and \"Mahoromatic\" (formerly licensed by Geneon). Their titles were initially distributed by ADV Films. On September 1, 2009, A.D. Vision had closed their doors and sold off their assets, which included transferring distribution rights to Section23 Films.\n\nOn July 4, 2013, during their industry panel at Anime Expo, Sentai Filmworks announced their plans to release a number of classic titles from Tatsunoko Production. The current list of released titles from the partnership include the original \"Gatchaman\" series and , \"\", and \"Casshan\", with more titles to follow.\n\nSunrise announced a licensing deal with Sentai Filmworks that included a number of titles from Sunrise’s library that were formerly licensed by Bandai Entertainment during their Otakon panel on August 8, 2013.\n\nSentai's anime titles were initially localized and produced by Seraphim Digital. Certain titles such as \"Queen's Blade Rebellion\" and \"\" were produced by NYAV Post and Bang Zoom! Entertainment, respectively. In 2014, Sentai Filmworks had opened their in-house localization and recording facility, Sentai Studios.\n\nOn June 1, 2015, Sentai made an announcement on their website that \"Akame ga Kill!\" has been picked up by Adult Swim for broadcast on its Toonami block, almost one week after its announcement at MomoCon 2015. The show began airing on August 8, 2015, and its premiere became the most watched in the block's history with over 1.8 million viewers. Another licensed title, \"Parasyte -the maxim-\", premiered on October 3, 2015. Sentai has promoted the time that the two shows air as \"#SentaiHour\" on social media. As a result of Daylight Saving Time ending, \"Children Who Chase Lost Voices\" would air during the 1st week of the \"Intruder III\" event on November 5, 2016 at 3AM.\n\nIn March 2017, Sentai signed a deal with Amazon to stream the majority of their new licenses exclusively on Anime Strike in the United States and Prime Video in Canada, starting with the Spring 2017 season.\n\nAfter the discontinuation of Anime Network Online, HIDIVE, LLC, a new company which is not affiliated with Anime Network, Section23, or Sentai Filmworks, acquired the service's assets and spun them off into a new streaming service called HIDIVE. Former subscriptions for Anime Network Online were migrated over to HIDIVE.\n\nHIDIVE is the exclusive carrier of selected licensed titles from Sentai and Section23, including English dubs, in addition to simulcasts, live-action titles, and older series. Following the closure of Anime Strike, HIDIVE began streaming titles that were previously exclusive to the former service.\n\nOn July 21, 2017, HIDIVE announced that the service will start to offer selected anime titles with Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.\n\nOn October 18, 2018, VRV announced that HIDIVE will be launching a channel on its service. HIDIVE's channel will replace that of Funimation, which left the service on November 9, 2018.\n\nSentai Filmworks does not directly release its properties in non-North American (English-speaking) markets as opposed to its predecessor, A.D. Vision. Instead it sub-licenses to other companies such as Manga Entertainment, MVM Entertainment, Anime Limited and Animatsu Entertainment in the United Kingdom and Siren Visual, Madman Entertainment, and Hanabee in Australia and New Zealand. In 2011, MVM licensed \"\" after Sentai's re-release of the series, and has done the same to \"Broken Blade\", \"Dream Eater Merry\", \"Rozen Maiden\" and \"Bodacious Space Pirates\" for release in the UK.\n\nIn Latin America, Sentai Filmworks sub-licenses their titles to companies like Crunchyroll and Amazon Prime Video. On July 21st, 2017, Hidive distributes selected Sentai Filmworks and simulcast titles with Spanish and Portuguese subtitles. On March 2018, it was revealed that Sentai Filmworks holds distribution rights to the film \"No Game, No Life Zero\" that the company gave to the Mexican distributor Madness Entertainment. It was revealed that they directly commissioned a Spanish dubbed version for the movie. On March 15 of the same year, Sentai Filmworks announced the acquisition of the anime \"Alice or Alice\" to Spain and Portugal, making the first official announcement on Sentai's side of an anime title in these countries.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2020234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020234", "title": "Street magic", "text": "Street magic\n\nStreet magic falls into two genres; traditional street performance and guerrilla magic. \n\nThe first definition of street magic refers to a traditional form of magic performance - that of busking. In this, the magician draws an audience from passers by and performs an entire act for them. In exchange, the magician seeks remuneration either by having a receptacle for tips available throughout the act (known in the parlance as a \"trickle show\"), or by offering a receptacle for tips at the end of the show. The term \"passing the hat\" comes from the practice of having the hat passed before the final trick is performed, as opposed to \"bottling\" the audience at the end of the performance.\n\nStreet magic most often consists of what has been referred to in the past as \"hand\" or \"pocket\" magic, sleight of hand. Whether card magic or magic performed with coins, balls, scarves, or rope, even occasionally mentalism (see notably: Kenny Lightfoot), regardless of the props involved, the ability to draw and hold an audience is cited by contemporary practitioners as a skill of greater importance than the illusions themselves.\n\nThe famous Indian Mango Tree is an old and venerated trick as performed by street magicians of the past and while it is demonstrably not of the hand magic variety, it exemplifies the fact that even large stage sized illusions can be presented in the street. In the trick, the magician apparently plants a mango seed, covers it with a cloth, makes mysterious incantations and, removing the cloth from time to time successively shows a tree of various heights, up to two or three feet. The same effect was achieved by the Apaches. Instead of a mango seed, a yucca seed was planted and watered. Covering the seed with a rawhide animal skin, the seed would apparently root, grow and finally flower within the span of but a few minutes.\n\nAnthropologists chronicle this form of street magic from approximately 3,000 years ago - and there are records of such performers across the continents, notably Europe, Asia/South Asia and the Middle East. While it is a very old performing style, its history is not particularly well documented in print. In his diary, Samuel Pepys mentions seeing magicians performing in this fashion and one can see street magicians in depictions by Hieronymous Bosch, William Hogarth, and Pieter Brueghel. Book XIII of Reginald Scot's \"Discoverie of Witchcraft\" (1584) describes magic tricks of the type performed by buskers in the 16th century.\nNew York based artist and magician Jeff Sheridan is regarded as one of the pre-eminent U.S. street magicians to emerge from the surge in street performance artistry which began in the late '60s. He authored the 1977 book, \"Street Magic\", taught Jeff McBride and allegedly was one of the performers who inspired and taught the young David Blaine after Blaine saw Sheridan perform in Central Park.\n\nMore recently, other performers have garnered accolades from the magic community for their contributions to the art. Jim Cellini (a.k.a. Richard Sullivan) has been a full-time street performer since the 1970s and has published a book (\"Cellini: The Royal Touch\") and DVDs (\"The Art of Street Performing, volumes 1 - 3\") on the subject. Gazzo Macee (a.k.a. Gary Osborne) has been a full-time street performer since the 1980s and has published a booklet (\"\"The Art of Krowd Keeping\" written for Gazzo by Danny Hustle and Jim Wells\") and DVD (\"Street Cups\") on the subject. Eric Evans has been a full-time professional since the 1990s and co-wrote -- along with Nowlin Craver -- a book on the subject (\"The Secret Art of Magic\").\n\nThe second category is more appropriately called \"guerrilla magic\" It is a relatively recent style of performing magic illusions where the magician performs a single trick or two in a public space (such as on a sidewalk) for an unpaying audience. The desired effect of this \"hit and run\" style of magic is to give the audience a feeling that what they are seeing is impromptu, unrehearsed, and experimental.\n\nThis style of \"street magic\" is associated with David Blaine (who popularized the term) and more recently, Criss Angel, Derren Brown and Cyril Takayama. The format was developed to play well on television beginning with the 1997 ABC television special \"David Blaine: Street Magic.\" Many magicians respect Blaine's choice of material and give him credit for creating an image of the contemporary magician distinct from other magicians in recent television history, such as David Copperfield or Doug Henning. However, magic historians, such as Jamy Ian Swiss note that \"guerrilla magic\" is primarily associated with only a few individuals who perform on television and certain magic dealers that sell effects to amateur magicians who watch these programs. Eugene Burger opined to Jamy Ian Swiss \"On one level it's the ultimate trivialization of magic: accosting strangers on the street.\"\n"}

Tap dance choreographies typically start on the eighth beat, or between the eighth and the first count.\n\nTap was formed from other types of dancing, such as ballet, jazz and contemporary clogging.\nHoofers are tap dancers who dance only with their feet, making a louder, more grounded sound. This kind of tap dancing is also called \"rhythm tap\".\n\nAnother aspect of tap dancing is improvisation. This can either be done with music and follow the beats provided or without musical accompaniment, otherwise known as a cappella dancing.\n\nThere is no universal terminology for tap techniques and steps. The following includes descriptions of steps that are well known, although the names may vary.\n\n\n\n\nAll tap dancing steps are a combination of simple movements that build upon each other. Most movements, simple and complex, include \"taps\", \"drops\", \"brushes\" (including shuffles and flaps), and \"steps\". For example, \"shuffle ball change\" is a shuffle followed by a ball change. Tap dancing steps may be learned and mastered by children and adults alike and are a good way to express/learn rhythm, dance, and percussion.\n\n"}
{"id": "1570530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1570530", "title": "Tetractys", "text": "Tetractys\n\nThe tetractys (), or tetrad, or the tetractys of the decad is a triangular figure consisting of ten points arranged in four rows: one, two, three, and four points in each row, which is the geometrical representation of the fourth triangular number. As a mystical symbol, it was very important to the secret worship of Pythagoreanism. There were four seasons, and the number was also associated with planetary motions and music.\n\n\nA prayer of the Pythagoreans shows the importance of the Tetractys (sometimes called the \"Mystic Tetrad\"), as the prayer was addressed to it.\n\nAs a portion of the secret religion, initiates were required to swear a secret oath by the Tetractys. They then served as novices for a period of silence lasting five years.\n\nThe Pythagorean oath also mentioned the Tetractys:\n\nIt is said that the Pythagorean musical system was based on the Tetractys as the rows can be read as the ratios of 4:3 (perfect fourth), 3:2 (perfect fifth), 2:1 (octave), forming the basic intervals of the Pythagorean scales. That is, Pythagorean scales are generated from combining pure fourths (in a 4:3 relation), pure fifths (in a 3:2 relation), and the simple ratios of the unison 1:1 and the octave 2:1. Note that the diapason, 2:1 (octave), and the diapason plus diapente, 3:1 (compound fifth or perfect twelfth), are consonant intervals according to the tetractys of the decad, but that the diapason plus diatessaron, 8:3 (compound fourth or perfect eleventh), is not.\nThere are some who believe that the tetractys and its mysteries influenced the early Kabbalah. A Hebrew tetractys has the letters of the Tetragrammaton inscribed on the ten positions of the tetractys, from right to left. It has been argued that the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, with its ten spheres of emanation, is in some way connected to the tetractys, but its form is not that of a triangle. The occultist Dion Fortune writes: \n\nThe relationship between geometrical shapes and the first four Sephirot is analogous to the geometrical correlations in Tetraktys, shown above under Pythagorean Symbol, and unveils the relevance of the Tree of Life with the Tetraktys.\n\nIn a Tarot reading, the various positions of the tetractys provide a representation for forecasting future events by signifying according to various occult disciplines, such as Alchemy. Below is only a single variation for interpretation.\n\nThe first row of a single position represents the Premise of the reading, forming a foundation for understanding all the other cards.\n\nThe second row of two positions represents the cosmos and the individual and their relationship.\n\nThe third row of three positions represents three kinds of decisions an individual must make.\n\nThe fourth row of four positions represents the four Greek elements.\n\nThe tetractys occurs (generally coincidentally) in the following:\n\nIn English-language poetry, a tetractys is a syllable-counting form with five lines. The first line has one syllable, the second has two syllables, the third line has three syllables, the fourth line has four syllables, and the fifth line has ten syllables. A sample tetractys would look like this:\n\nThe tetractys was created by Ray Stebbing, who said the following about his newly created form:\n\n\n\n"}

It premiered on June 13, 1999, and was the second longest-running weekly entertainment news and talk show in Philippine television after GMA Network's \"Startalk\". It featured local celebrity gossip and news.\n\n\"The Buzz\" viewers were surprised when the show got cancelled with its official final episode on April 5, 2015, in order to give way for \"Kapamilya Blockbusters\" since April 12, 2015.\n\n\"The Buzz\" premiered on June 13, 1999, as it replaced the popular sunday afternoon Showbiz-oriented talk show (run for seven years) \"Showbiz Lingo\", and was originally hosted solely by Boy Abunda. The show's original format was similar to ABS-CBN's \"The Correspondents\" were Abunda interacts with a group of showbiz field reporters dishing out the latest showbiz news. Showbiz columnist Ricky Lo and John Lapus were the first co-hosts of the show, along with Tim Yap and Dolly Anne Carvajal as reporters.\n\nThe format was later on discarded when the network took in Kris Aquino during the show's second season on January 9, 2000. Aquino's inclusion in the show served as a reunion of sorts between her and Abunda, when they used to host \"Startalk\" on GMA Network. The show became an interesting gabfest with Aquino and Abunda dishing out the latest exclusives with the help of its reliable staff. Actress and model Angelica Jones and columnist Pat-P Daza-Planas were introduced as the new segment presenters after the departure of Yap and Carvajal from the show. Jones left the show a year later, and was replaced by reporter and blogger JV Villar in 2002, but later left after a few months. This was also the same year where Pat-P decided to leave due to commitments with her family and pursuing other ventures.\n\nIn 2003, the duo welcomed Cristy Fermin as an additional host, who used to headline the network's Saturday talk show \"\" and its predecessor \"Showbiz Lingo\". Her opinions and commentaries made the show wider and more noticeable. This was also the same year where one of its original hosts, Lo, left to transfer to GMA Network.\n\nPhoemela Barranda, who was then working at ABS-CBN's flagship newscast \"TV Patrol World\" as the anchor of \"Star Patrol\", joined the show to headline the teasers before it actually starts in 2004. In 2005, one of its pioneer hosts, Lapus, left the show after his contract in ABS-CBN expired and was given a hosting stint to GMA's \"S-Files\". The show welcomed actress Anne Curtis to host the new segment \"Wanna Buzz\", but was later discarded a year later into \"Pinoy Big Brother Buzz\" (following the debut of the Philippine franchise of Big Brother), where she was joined by gossip reporter AJ Dee and comedians Chokoleit and Pokwang, but it did not do well, so the network decided to shelve the segment.\n\nJobert Sucaldito served as the replacement of Lapus in 2006. This year also presented \"Buzz Express\", wherein other showbiz-related news were presented within a time span of 1–2 minutes. It was voice-overed by Roxy Liquigan and Eric John Salut, both staff of the show.\n\nOn March 11, 2007, Ruffa Gutierrez became the temporary replacement for Aquino who left the show to focus on her pregnancy and her family. Dawn Zulueta also served as a guest co-host when Ruffa Gutierrez went to the United States for a two-week vacation. When Gutierrez returned in June 2007, the network offered her a permanent co-hosting job in the show.\n\nIn October 15, 2008, Cristy Fermin was suspended by the network after she rattled off a series of accusations against former actress Nadia Montenegro in an episode aired on October 5, 2008. According to a statement released by the network, \"It was deemed that Ms. Fermin did not conduct herself with due regard to social conventions and public morals. Her statements went beyond the bounds of decency as they involved innocent children who were not party to their personal dispute. Ms. Fermin's statements violated the highest standards of professionalism and journalistic integrity. The act committed by Ms. Fermin brought her and \"The Buzz\" to public disrepute, jeopardizing the name and goodwill of both the show and the network.\" On October 19, 2008, Ai-Ai de las Alas served as a substitute host for Cristy Fermin, who was suspended by the network for two months, until Aquino returned to the show on October 26, 2008.\n\nIn March 2010, Ruffa Gutierrez left the show after signing an exclusive contract to TV5. KC Concepcion later replaced her on April 11, 2010.\n\nOn June 27, 2010, Aquino left the show after being an on-and-off host of the show for ten years. She decided to leave the show for the reason of that she wanted to spend time with her family and for her not to cause any trouble while her brother, Benigno S. Aquino III, is still in office as the President of the Philippines. Sucaldito, who has been on the show for 4 years, decided to left to concentrate on radio broadcasting (through his DZMM program \"Mismo!\" with Ahwel Paz) and his columnist job in Bulgar. After Aquino's departure, Charlene Gonzales and Toni Gonzaga replaced her as hosts on July 11, 2010. On January 8, 2012, KC Concepcion left the show in order to focus as the \"X Factor Philippines\" host.\n\nOn October 13, 2013, Gonzaga and Gonzales bid farewell to the show. With the two hosts departure, Abunda hinted that the program will be undergoing changes. Abunda said, \"Sa inyong walang patid na pagsubaybay, sa inyong walang sawang pagsuporta at sa patuloy naming pagbibigay serbisyo, kasama kayo sa isang panibagong simula. Kasali kayo sa pagbubukas ng isang bagong kabanata, mas malawak, mas malaki. Pakikinggan, paguusapan at pakikialaman. Ito ang pagbabagong kakapitan, pagbabagong tatatak sa puso at isipan. Ito ang inyong \"The Buzz\".\"\n\nOn October 20, 2013, \"The Buzz\" format was discontinued and was reformatted into an interactive entertainment talk-show called \"Buzz ng Bayan\" (English: Buzz of the Nation). With the reformat, together with Boy Abunda, Carmina Villaroel and Janice de Belen were added as hosts. The show had three segments, namely: Top News Items, Opinions, and Panel Discussion. After the segment \"Top News Items\", several personalities known as Bayan Buzzers (usually three), would give their own opinions regarding that certain issue. Aida Espiritu, aide of ABS-CBN president, CEO and COO Charo Santos-Concio and Onse Tolentino, a comedian and entertainment reporter/columnist, were the most notable and considered the resident Bayan Buzzers.\nMore than 6 months after the reformatted \"The Buzz\" came into airing, Villaroel confirmed that the show will again be reformatted and return to its old title as \"The Buzz\". She also confirmed that she will not be part of the reformat, and stated that two former hosts in \"The Buzz\" will return to the show together with Boy Abunda.\n\nOn May 14, 2014, in ABS-CBN's official YouTube channel, the network hinted that the show will be revert to its original title, \"The Buzz 15\". The said reformat will coincide the show's 15th year anniversary. It premiered on May 18, 2014 featuring footage of the show's first episode and some of its most notable interviews and commentaries, then afterwards Abunda graced the show's re-opening. He later introduced the return of Toni Gonzaga and Kris Aquino as his co-hosts. This also marked the return of the segment P.O.V., wherein their first topic was about the concept of linked showbiz couples. After its pilot aired, most viewers applauded the show for its reformat and hoping for more episodes to come with this new and fresher look to show.\n\nOn April 5, 2015, \"The Buzz\" had their last show on an Easter Sunday. Boy Abunda delivered the final farewell on behalf of the co-hosts and staff, following the VTR that detailed the show's history and controversies that the hosts dealt with. Abunda cited changes through the years pertaining to how technology has changed the world, how it's changed the way we communicate, how it's changed the media, and how the news is delivered. But he assured three points in his farewell speech; \"they will be back\", \"showbiz news is here to stay\", and \"the talk show genre is here to stay\".\n\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of the awards and nominations received by \"The Buzz\" and its hosts:\n\n"}
{"id": "826673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=826673", "title": "Yut", "text": "Yut\n\nYut Nori, also known as Yunnori, Nyout, and Yoot, is a traditional board game played in Korea, especially during Korean New Year. The game is also called \"cheok-sa\" or \"sa-hee\". The combining-form \"-nori\" means 'game'.\n\nAlthough the origins of this popular family game are unclear, some research suggests that yut was played as early as the Three Kingdoms (57 BCE – 668 CE). The \"Taiping Imperial Reader\" states that people of Baekje played a board game similar to Po Yut, which is believed to be similar to Pachisi, a board game originating in India.\n\nThere is a folk explanation for the game, describing a bet by some villagers to raise five different kind of livestock: pigs, dogs, sheep, cows and horses. Each of the villagers would raise only one type.\n\nThe board and the game are known to have been used in casting hexagrams, particularly in mountain-areas and small farming-villages, but this is no longer practiced.\n\nThe board (\"mal-pan\", 말판) is normally made of stitched cloth. The modern board is a rectangular shape, but historically there was also a round variation. There are four straight courses and two diagonal ones. Each of the straight courses comes with five stations, the diagonal ones have five stations, too, but one is shared. This brings the number of stations to twenty-nine in total. The board is also known to sometimes be drawn onto the floor.\n\nInstead of dice, yut-sticks are used. (These are similar to those used in the Egyptian board game Senet.) There are two kinds of yut-stick: \"jang-jak yut\" (장작 윷) and \"bam yut\" (밤 윷). Jang-jak yut are made of firewood. There are four sticks of about 15 cm in length and from 2 cm to 3 cm. in diameter. These sticks are split into halves. Chestnut-wood is most commonly used, but birch-wood is also common. These woods are chosen for their weight and the fresh sound they make when playing. Bam yut, on the other hand, are wooden sticks of about 3 cm in length. They have a diameter of about 1 cm, and also are split into halves. The bam yut are played in a small bowl, shaken in the palm, and then released.\n\nThere are small tokens (marks) used for the game, called \"mal\" (말, literally a \"horse\"). There are four tokens for each team, although there are no common rules what a token can be made of. The only rule is that the mals of the opponent teams must be clearly distinguishable. Apart from black and white plastic tokens generally found today, common mals are coins, buttons, small pebbles, or even chess beads (both from Western chess and Korean chess). When choosing the mal, some Koreans consider its \"speed\", because the faster a \"horse\" runs, the better it is thought to run.\n\nThe sticks are cast to determine how far a token can advance. The score is determined by counting the sticks that are over, and those that are up. Each combination has a name. One stick over (flat side up) and three sticks up (round side up) is called \"do\". Two sticks up and two sticks over is called \"gae\" (dog). One stick up and three sticks over is called \"geol\". All sticks over is called \"yut\", whereas all sticks up is called \"mo\". A \"do\" is worth one space advancement, a \"gae\" is worth two space advancement, a \"geol\" is worth 3 space advancement, \"yut\" is worth 4 space advancement, and \"mo\" is worth 5 space advancement. When the sticks come to the result of either \"yut\" or \"mo\", the player has another chance of throwing the sticks up again (optional- some people prefer not to play with this rule). If you get \"yut\" or \"mo\" consecutively, you play (throw) again.\n\nThe game is played between two partners or two teams who play in turns, sometimes it is played with more teams. There is no limit in the number of participants in a game, which means that the game can be played by a considerable group. When played with large groups it is not uncommon for some group members never to cast the sticks: they still participate discussing the strategy.\n\nThe start of the game is determined by each team casting the yut-sticks. The team with the highest score starts first.\n\nEach team then casts the sticks in turn, then moves a mal according to the score achieved. One turn usually consists of only one cast. However, a player achieving a \"yut\" or \"mo\" earns an extra cast for the turn; if he/she casts a \"yut\" or \"mo\" at the second cast, he/she earns an extra cast again, so there is no limit to the number of times a player can cast again before the end of a turn, provided he or she keeps casting \"yuts\" or \"mos\". The respective scores can be played separately if wished, each given to another mal (or group of mals, see below), but a score earned from one cast cannot be split into two moves—for example, a \"geol\" (advance three steps) cannot be split into a \"do\" (one step) and a \"gae\" (two steps).\n\nAs long as there are mals outside the board, a team can either put a new mal onto the board according to the scores it got, or move a mal already on the board. The mals travel around the board and can move forward only. However, when landing on one of the big stations (in the corner and the centre), the team can choose to take the shorter way should they wish to. There are four possible courses, the default course being longest one with no abbreviation (No. 4).\n\nIf a mal lands on a station occupied by the opponent's team, the opponent's mal is removed from the course and returned to the starting position, and the current player is allowed to cast again.\n\nIf a mal lands on a station occupied by the own team, these mals can form a group and travel together from that point on.  However, this bears a risk: If an opponent lands their mal on a station occupied by a group of mals of the opponent, all mals in the group are removed from the course.\n\nFor example, if one casts two \"yuts\" and one \"do\" at his/her first turn in the game, possible moves would include (see \"The Stations\" below for the station names):\n\n\nThe game is won by the team who brings all their mals home first, that is complete the course with all their mals. A course is completed if a mal passes the station where the game is started (\"cham-meoki\"). Landing on cham-meoki is no finish, but any score going \"beyond\" this station completes a home run. Yut is often played for three or more wins.\n\nThe game is sometimes enhanced by labeling one, two, or three of the yut stick on their flat side. The \"Seoul\" rule can be played if one of the sticks is labelled \"Seoul\" (서울). If this stick is the only one facing down (\"do\" so that the letters \"Seoul\" can be read), a mal can be placed directly into the centre (\"bang\"), which in this case is called \"Seoul\". If all the mals are already on the course, this counts as a \"do\". The \"Busan\" rule is similar. One of the yut sticks is labelled \"Busan\" (부산). Rather than to the centre, the mal travels directly to the far corner (\"mo\"). Again, this only applies if this is the only stick facing down, and not all mals are on the course already.\n\nThere is also the \"back\" rule, where one of the sticks is labelled \"back\" (후퇴). If this is the only stick facing down, one of the mals has to go back one step. Depending on the rules used, if none of the mals are on the course, then this is counted as either a \"do\" or a skipped turn. Alternatively, if the \"do\" rule is not being used, the other most common rule is for a mal to be placed onto the arrow next to the start. The mal remains there until another \"back\" is cast. In this case, however, the mal completes the course at once. Furthermore, if a mal is placed on the do spot, and then gets a \"back\", then they will be on the \"cham-meoki\" spot and then will exit the malpan when a do, gae or geul, yut or mo is thrown. Another \"back\" will put them on the nal-yut spot.\n\nThe game is a popular board game throughout Korea, and it is considered a game of deep tradition. The game is often treated as a social spectacle with onlookers and team members shouting loudly, encouraging each other, or wishing for a certain score. This game is played in almost every Seollal gathering and is commonly played in almost any region of the world with a significant Korean population. The rare scores of \"yut\" and \"mo\" in particular cause excitement, particularly if cast more than one at a time.\n\nThe Australian film and theatre group, Yut Art, takes its names from the game as a result of the excitement and crowd participation associated with its activities.\n\nEach station of the gameboard has its own name, although they are obscure to most Koreans. It is thought that the outer stations symbolize heaven, and the inner square, the earth. The whole board can be also interpreted as a reflection of universal symmetry and celestial procession, reflecting elements of Korean shamanism.\n\nThe mid-Joseon writer Gim Munpyo described the Yut board as symbolising the circle of the cosmos, with the North Star in the centre, surrounded by 28 constellations.\n\n\nBibliography\n\n"}
