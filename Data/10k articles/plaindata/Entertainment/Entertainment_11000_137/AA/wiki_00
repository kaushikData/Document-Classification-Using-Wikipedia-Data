It is about a drought-impoverished rancher (Bale) who takes on the dangerous job of taking a notorious outlaw (Crowe) to justice. It is a remake of the , making it the second adaptation of Elmore Leonard's short story \"Three-Ten to Yuma\". Filming took place in various locations in New Mexico. \"3:10 to Yuma\" opened September 7, 2007, in the United States and received positive reviews from critics.\n\nDan Evans (Bale) is an impoverished rancher and Civil War veteran. He owes money to Glen Hollander (Loftin) and when he fails to pay, two of Hollander's men set fire to his barn. The next morning, as Evans and his two sons William (Lerman) and Mark look for their herd, they stumble upon outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) and his gang, who have taken advantage of Evans' cattle in order to block the road and ambush an armored stagecoach staffed by Pinkerton agents. As Wade's outfit loots the upended stage, Wade discovers Evans and his two sons watching from the hills. Determining that they pose no threat to him and his gang, Wade takes their horses and tells Evans that he will leave them tied up on the road to Bisbee. Wade's gang departs, and Evans rescues the lone surviving coach guard, Byron McElroy (Fonda), left alive but severely wounded by Wade.\n\nWade travels with his gang to Bisbee to celebrate at the local saloon and divide up the loot, then chooses to stay behind to enjoy the company of the barmaid while his gang departs. Evans arrives separately with McElroy and delivers him to Doc Potter (Tudyk), then tries in vain to negotiate with Hollander, who shoves him to the ground and departs. Enraged, Evans barges into the saloon looking for him, but instead encounters Wade emerging from an upstairs room. Evans coaxes a few dollars from Wade over the trouble the outlaw has caused him, delaying the outlaw long enough for the railroad men to ambush and arrest him.\n\nThe railroad's representative, Grayson Butterfield, enlists McElroy, Potter, Tucker (one of Hollander's men), and Evans, to deliver Wade to Contention, where Wade will be put on the 3:10 afternoon train to Yuma Territorial Prison. Evans requests a $200 fee to deliver Wade for transport, which Butterfield accepts. From Evans' ranch, McElroy arranges a decoy wagon to distract Wade's gang, now led by Charlie Prince, with the real prisoner transport departing later that night.\n\nDuring the journey, both Tucker and McElroy provoke Wade, who in turn kills them. Wade attempts to escape, but is stopped when William appears, having followed the group all the way from the ranch. When the group is then attacked by Apaches, Wade kills the attackers and escapes to a Chinese laborer construction camp, where the foreman captures him. Evans, William, Potter and Butterfield arrive to regain custody of their prisoner, but the local posse is unwilling to give him up, and a fight ensues. The group manages to escape, but Potter is killed in the process. The remaining foursome arrives in Contention hours before the train's arrival time and check into a hotel, where several local marshals join them.\n\nWade's gang members ambush the decoy wagon, interrogating the lone survivor before killing him, then depart for Contention. Upon arriving, Prince offers a reward to any citizen who shoots any of Wade's captors, and numerous men volunteer, causing the town's marshals to desert immediately, only to be killed by Wade's men. Butterfield resigns as well, but agrees to keep William safe, as Evans is determined to complete the mission.\n\nEvans escorts Wade out of the hotel, and the two make their way across town, evading continuous gunfire from the combined gang and townsmen. Wade surprises Evans and nearly strangles him, but relents when Evans reveals that delivering Wade to the train is not only to provide for his family, but to restore his own sense of honor, and give his sons something good to remember him for. Wade then admits he has already been to Yuma Prison and escaped twice, and agrees to board the train, allowing Evans' contract to be fulfilled.\n\nWade helps Evans evade his gang, and as he finally boards the train, congratulates Evans, but Prince appears from behind and shoots Evans despite Wade's order to stop. Wade steps off the train, and when Prince returns his gun belt, abruptly executes Prince along with the rest of his gang. William appears and draws his gun on Wade but does not kill him, instead turning to his dying father. Wade boards the train and politely surrenders his weapon. Evans dies as William tells him he accomplished his mission and got the money. As the train disappears around a bend, Wade whistles, and his faithful horse pricks up his ears and gallops after the train indicating that Wade is planning to escape.\n\n\nIn June 2003, Columbia Pictures announced a negotiation with Mangold to helm a remake of the 1957 Western film \"3:10 to Yuma\", based on a script written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas. After being apart from the project for several years, Mangold resumed his role as director in February 2006. Production was slated to begin in summer 2006. In the same month, Tom Cruise expressed an interest in starring as the villain in the film. Eric Bana also briefly sought a role in the film.\nIn summer 2006, Columbia placed the film in turnaround, and the project was acquired by Relativity Media. Crowe and Bale were cast as the main characters, and Relativity began seeking a distributor for the film. By September, Lions Gate Entertainment signed on to distribute the film. Later in the month, Peter Fonda, Gretchen Mol, Dallas Roberts, Ben Foster, and Vinessa Shaw were cast. Filming was slated to begin on October 23, 2006 in New Mexico. On the first day of filming, a rider and his horse were seriously injured in a scene when the horse ran directly into a camera-carrying vehicle instead of veering off as planned. The rider was hospitalized, and the horse had to be euthanized on the set. The animal's death prompted an investigation from the American Humane Association. By November, the AHA concluded its investigation, finding that the horse did not respond accordingly due to having received a dual training approach and the rider not being familiar with the mount. The organization recommended no charges against the producers. Principal photography took place in and around Santa Fe, Abiqui√∫, and Galisteo. The Bonanza Creek Ranch represented the film's town of Bisbee as a \"kinder, gentler frontier town\" while Galisteo was set up to be Contention (now a ghost town), a \"much rougher, bawdier, kind of sin city\". Another location was the scenic Diablo Canyon, and another was the Gilman Tunnels () along New Mexico State Road 485. Filming concluded on January 20, 2007.\n\nAfter filming concluded, the owners of the Cerro Pelon Ranch petitioned to keep a $2 million expansion to the movie set on their property, which was supposed to be dismantled within 90 days. The set of \"3:10 to Yuma\" made up 75% of the overall sets on the ranch. In April 2007, the request was met by the county's development review committee to keep the expansion, which would potentially generate revenue in the future.\n\n\"3:10 to Yuma\" was originally slated for an October 5, 2007 release, but Lionsgate moved the film's release a month earlier to September 7, 2007 to beat competing Western films \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" and \"No Country for Old Men\". As a result of the move, the studio was not able to use the Toronto International Film Festival as a platform for the film's release, but it was released before a cluster of films similarly vying for awards. According to Lionsgate president Tom Ortenberg, \"In what is shaping up to be a very impressive and crowded field of upscale commercial motion pictures this fall, we wanted to be one of the first ones out, so that everything else will be measured against us.\" The earlier theatrical run positioned it for a prominent high-definition Blu-ray Disc and DVD release in the first week of January, during awards seasons. Lionsgate similarly planned this strategy for \"Crash\" (2004), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year.\n\nIn Germany, the film was released by Columbia Pictures, which had produced the 1957 original.\n\n\"3:10 to Yuma\" debuted in the United States and Canada on September 7, 2007, in 2,652 theaters. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $14,035,033 and ranked #1 at the U.S. and Canadian box office. \"3:10 to Yuma\" grossed an estimated $53,606,916 in the United States and $16,409,304 in other territories for a worldwide total of $70,016,220.\n\n\"3:10 to Yuma\" received positive reviews from critics. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 89%, based on 219 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The remake of this classic Western improves on the original, thanks to fiery performances from Russell Crowe and Christian Bale as well as sharp direction from James Mangold.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 76 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nAndrew Sarris of \"The New York Observer\" said \"There is more greed-driven corruption in the remake than there was in the original\" and that the film is less a remake \"than a resurrection of both the film and its now unfashionable genre.\" Sarris said Fonda and Foster \"are especially memorable\" and said \"the performances of Mr. Crowe and Mr. Bale alone are worth the price of admission.\"\n\"The New Yorker\" film critic David Denby wrote that the film \"is faster, more cynical, and more brutal\" than the 1957 film. Denby wrote that Fonda \"gives an amazingly fierce performance\" and that Crowe \"gives a fascinating, self-amused performance\", saying \"Crowe is an acting genius.\" Denby said \"this is by far [director James Mangold's] most sustained and evocative work.\" Denby wrote that \"much of this Western is tense and intricately wrought.\"\nTy Burr of \"The Boston Globe\" called the film \"lean, almost absurdly satisfying.\" Burr wrote that Crowe and Bale \"are among the best, most intuitively creative we have, and whatever transpires offscreen in Crowe‚Äôs case, onscreen they only serve their characters. Neither man showboats here, and it‚Äôs a thrill to watch them work.\" Burr said that the character of Ben Wade is \"a snake and a snake charmer in one irresistible package\" and said Foster as Charlie Prince is \"mesmerizing.\" Burr said \"Bale and Crowe never once misstep\" and that Mangold \"steers clear of \"Deadwood\" revisionism.\" Burr, however, wrote that the ending \"makes little to no sense in a post-Clint Eastwood universe.\"\n\nBruce Westbrook of the \"Houston Chronicle\" gave the film 3¬Ω stars and called it \"the best Western since \"Unforgiven\"\", calling it \"both cathartic and intelligent.\" He wrote that the film \"draws clear inspiration from the lonely heroics of \"High Noon\"\" and said \"While a wildly eventful action-adventure and outlaw shoot-'em-up, it's also a vibrant story of heroism, villainy and hard-earned redemption.\" Westbrook said that Crowe and Bale are \"at the top of their game\" and \"Crowe is reliably charismatic as a man who's less craven and bloodthirsty than wise, resourceful and expedient.\" Shawn Levy of \"The Oregonian\" gave the film a \"B+\" and said the film is \"grounded in something like the credible realism of a John Ford Western but which also can appease the thirsts for blood, wit and tension harbored by fans of Quentin Tarantino.\" Levy wrote \"The original film spends much time on conversation between Wade and Evans and focuses more on Evans' wife, whereas the new film has more action sequences and is infused subtly with themes that echo vexing contemporary political and moral issues.\" Levy said \"Christian Bale gives us another of his wounded, desperate, stubborn men\" and \"Russell Crowe fills a role originated by Glenn Ford with a big dose of the mocking charisma, cool discernment and casual cruelty of Robert Mitchum.\" Levy said the climax \"sews up the narrative too quickly\", but called the film \"a fine and sturdy picture.\"\n\n\"Christian Science Monitor\" critic Peter Rainer gave the film a \"B+\" and wrote \"what Alfred Hitchcock once said about thrillers also applies to Westerns: The stronger the bad guy, the better the film. By that measure, \"3:10 to Yuma\" is excellent.\" Comparing the film to the 1957 film, Rainer wrote that the film \"is larger in scope than its predecessor, and significantly altered in its ending, but essentially it's the same old morality play.\" Rainer said the \"drippy father-son stuff is the least successful aspect of the movie.\" Rainer also wrote \"Bale acts as if he's still playing the POW survivalist from Werner Herzog's \"Rescue Dawn\"\" and said \"his hyperrealistic performance is a drag next to Crowe's dapper prince of darkness.\" Rainer said Crowe's \"underplaying here is in many ways as hammy as if he were overplaying, and that's just fine.\" \nRichard Schickel of \"TIME\" magazine said \"when a movie is as entertaining as this one, you begin to think this formerly beloved genre is due for a revival.\" Schickel said the 1957 film \"was, in my opinion, not as good as a lot of people thought\" and said Crowe \"never settles for predictability when he's on screen and never lets us settle into complacency as we watch him.\" Schickel wrote that director Mangold \"never loses his crispness or his narrative efficiency.\" Schickel said the comparisons to \"Unforgiven\" \"are not entirely apt\", saying that \"Mangold's offering lacks the blackness and absurdity\" of that film. He wrote, \"It is more in the vein of Anthony Mann's westerns of the 1950s ‚Äî trim, efficiently paced, full of briskly stated conflicts that edge up to the dark side, but never fully embrace it.\"\n\nThe film received two Academy Award nominations for the 80th Academy Awards. Marco Beltrami was nominated for Best Original Score, and Paul Massey, David Giammarco, and Jim Stuebe were nominated for Best Sound Mixing. The film also received a nomination for Best Cast at the 14th Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\n"}
{"id": "1315924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1315924", "title": "576i", "text": "576i\n\n576i is a standard-definition video mode originally used for broadcast television in most countries of the world where the utility frequency for electric power distribution is 50¬†Hz. Because of its close association with the color encoding system, it is often referred to as simply PAL, PAL/SECAM or SECAM when compared to its 60¬†Hz (typically, see PAL-M) NTSC-color-encoded counterpart, 480i. In digital applications it is usually referred to as \"576i\"; in analogue contexts it is often called \"625 lines\", and the aspect ratio is usually 4:3 in analogue transmission and 16:9 in digital transmission.\n\nThe \"576\" identifies a vertical resolution of 576 lines, and the \"i\" identifies it as an interlaced resolution. The field rate, which is 50 Hz, is sometimes included when identifying the video mode, i.e. 576i50; another notation, endorsed by both the International Telecommunication Union in BT.601 and SMPTE in SMPTE 259M, includes the frame rate, as in 576i/25.\n\nIts basic parameters common to both analogue and digital implementations are: 576 scan lines or vertical pixels of picture content, 25 frames (giving 50 fields) per second.\n\nIn analogue 49 additional lines without image content are added to the displayed frame of 576 lines to allow time for older cathode ray tube circuits to retrace for the next frame, giving 625 lines per frame. Digital information not to be displayed as part of the image can be transmitted in the non-displayed lines; teletext and other services and test signals are often implemented.\n\nAnalogue television signals have no pixels; they are rastered in scan lines, but along each line the signal is continuous. In digital applications, the number of pixels per line is an arbitrary choice as long as it fulfils the sampling theorem. Values above about 500 pixels per line are enough for conventional free-to-air television; DVB-T, DVD and DV allow better values such as 704 or 720.\n\nThe video format can be transported by major digital television formats, ATSC, DVB and ISDB, and on DVD, and it supports aspect ratios of standard and anamorphic .\n\nWhen 576i video is transmitted via baseband (i.e., via consumer device cables, not via RF), most of the differences between the \"one-letter\" systems are no longer significant, other than vertical resolution and frame rate.\n\nIn this context, unqualified 576i invariably means\n\n576i when it is transmitted over free-to-air satellite signals is transmitted substantially differently from terrestrial transmission.\n\nFull transponder mode (e.g., 72¬†MHz)\n\nHalf-transponder mode (e.g., 36¬†MHz)\n\nIn digital video applications, such as DVDs and digital broadcasting, color encoding is no longer significant; in that context, 576i means only\n\nThere is no longer any difference (in the digital domain) between PAL and SECAM. Digital video uses its own separate color space, so even the minor color space differences between PAL and SECAM become moot in the digital domain.\n\nWhen 576i is used to transmit content that was originally composed of 25 full progressive frames per second, the odd field of the frame is transmitted first. This is the opposite than of NTSC. Systems which recover progressive frames, or transcode video should ensure that this field order is obeyed, otherwise the recovered frame will consist of a field from one frame and a field from an adjacent frame, resulting in 'comb' interlacing artifacts.\n\nMotion pictures are typically shot on film at 24 frames per second. When telecined and played back at PAL's standard of 25 frames per second, films run about 4% faster. This also applies to most TV series that are shot on film or digital 24p. Unlike NTSC's telecine system, which uses to convert the 24 frames per second to the 30 fps frame rate, PAL speed-up results in the telecined video running 4% shorter than the original film as well as the equivalent NTSC telecined video.\n\nDepending on the sound system in use, it also slightly increases the pitch of the soundtrack by 70.67 cents (0.7067 of a semitone). More recently, digital conversion methods have used algorithms which preserve the original pitch of the soundtrack, although the frame rate conversion still results in faster playback.\n\nConversion methods exist that can convert 24 frames per second video to 25 frames per second with no speed increase, however image quality suffers when conversions of this type are used. This method is most commonly employed through conversions done digitally (i.e. using a computer and software like VirtualDub), and is employed in situations where the importance of preserving the speed of the video outweighs the need for image quality.\n\nMany movie enthusiasts prefer PAL over NTSC despite the former's speed-up, because the latter results in telecine judder, a visual distortion not present in PAL sped-up video. states \"the majority of authorities on the subject favour PAL over NTSC for DVD playback quality\". Also DVD reviewers often make mention of this cause. For example, in his PAL vs. NTSC article, the founder of MichaelDVD says: \"Personally, I find [3:2 pulldown] all but intolerable and find it very hard to watch a movie on an NTSC DVD because of it.\" In the DVD review of \"Frequency\", one of his reviewers mentions: \"because of the 3:2 pull-down artefacts that are associated with the NTSC format (‚Ä¶) I prefer PAL pretty much any day of the week\". This is not an issue on modern upconverting DVD players and personal computers, as they play back 23.97 frame/s‚Äìencoded video at its true frame rate, without 3:2 pulldown.\n\nPAL speed-up does not occur on native 25 fps video, such as British or European TV-series or movies that are shot on video instead of film.\n\nSoftware which corrects the speed-up is available for those viewing 576i DVD films on their computers, WinDVD's \"PAL TruSpeed\" being the most ubiquitous. However, this method involves resampling the soundtrack(s), which results in a slight decrease in audio quality. There is also a DirectShow Filter for Windows called ReClock developed by RedFox (formerly SlySoft) which can be used in a custom DirectShow Graph to remap the reference audio timing clock to correct the clock timing skew using an accurate self-adaptive algorithm resulting in effective removal of judder during panning caused by Euro pulldown including audio pitch correction via time-stretching with WASAPI Exclusive Mode and SPDIF AC/3 Encoding output modes.\n\n"}

{"id": "1038077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1038077", "title": "Amerika (miniseries)", "text": "Amerika (miniseries)\n\nAmerika is an American television miniseries that was broadcast in 1987 on ABC. The miniseries inspired a novelization entitled \"Amerika: The Triumph of the American Spirit\". \"Amerika\" starred Kris Kristofferson, Mariel Hemingway, Sam Neill, Robert Urich, and a 17-year-old Lara Flynn Boyle in her first major role. \"Amerika\" was about life in the United States after a bloodless takeover engineered by the Soviet Union. Not wanting to depict the actual takeover, ABC Entertainment president Brandon Stoddard set the miniseries ten years after the event, focusing on the demoralized U.S. people a decade after the Soviet conquest. The intent, he later explained, was to explore the U.S. spirit under such conditions, not to portray the conflict of the Soviet coup.\n\nDescribed in promotional materials as \"the most ambitious American miniseries ever created,\" \"Amerika\" aired for 14¬Ω hours (including commercials) over seven nights (beginning February 15, 1987), and reportedly cost US$40 million to produce. The miniseries was filmed in the Golden Horseshoe and southwestern Ontario Canadian cities of Toronto, London, and Hamilton, as well as various locations in the U.S. state of Nebraska ‚Äì most notably the small town of Tecumseh, which served as \"Milford\", the fictional setting for most of the series. Donald Wrye was the executive producer, director, and writer of \"Amerika\", while composer Basil Poledouris scored the miniseries, ultimately recording (with the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra) eight hours of music ‚Äì the equivalent of four feature films.\n\n\"Amerika\" has an indirect connection to another notable ABC program, the 1983 television film \"The Day After\", which some critics felt was too pacifist for portraying the doctrine of nuclear deterrence as pointless. Stoddard cited a column in the \"Los Angeles Herald-Examiner\" by Nixon speechwriter (and later, television personality) Ben Stein that appeared a few weeks before \"The Day After\" aired. Stein wrote, in part:\n\nStoddard acknowledged that Stein's remarks provided the inspiration for the series. Stein received a quitclaim fee for the idea and otherwise was not involved in the production of \"Amerika\". Originally envisioned as a four-hour made-for-TV movie entitled \"Topeka, Kansas, U.S.S.R.\", the project soon was expanded into a miniseries.\n\nThe storyline of \"Amerika\" primarily follows three political leaders:\n\nMajor female characters, in addition to Ballard, include Peter Bradford's wife, Amanda (played by Cindy Pickett), Devin Milford's ex-wife, Marion (played by Wendy Hughes), and most notably, Devin's sister Alethea (played by Christine Lahti), who at the outset is prostituting herself to the local occupation leader. \"Alethea is the center,\" noted Donald Wrye. \"She is a metaphor for America ‚Äì not just phonically ‚Äì and it is she who discovers her moral core through(out) the course of the series.\" Lara Flynn Boyle played Bradford's teenage daughter, Jackie.\n\nThe human drama of these characters intersects with the political intrigue of the Soviet plans for the breakup of the United States. Bradford, the pragmatist, clashes with Milford, the idealist; Bradford's wife is Milford's ex-girlfriend, who finds she still has feelings for Milford upon his release from the prison camp; Denisov appoints Milford's ex-wife, a powerful magistrate (and General Samanov's mistress), to serve as Bradford's deputy and assistant in Heartland; and Kimberly's renewed sense of U.S. pride ultimately affects her relationship with Denisov.\n\nTowards the end of the 1980s, as the decline of the Soviet Union puts it in danger of losing the Cold War, the Soviet leadership makes a desperate gamble to rearrange the global balance of power. Four large thermonuclear weapons are detonated in the ionosphere over the United States. The resulting electromagnetic pulse (or EMP) destroys the nation's communications and computer systems, cripples the U.S. electrical grid, and affects any equipment that relies on computer technology, such as most late-model automobiles. With its ICBMs inoperative‚Äîand the National Command Authority unable to contact U.S. military forces abroad or their foreign allies in western Europe to launch a counterattack‚Äîthe U.S. is forced to accept Soviet terms for surrender: unilateral disarmament, the end of the dollar as a reserve currency, and integration into the Soviet military/economic bloc. The United States quickly falls under Soviet military occupation under the command of Russian General Petya Samanov, and the U.S. President and U.S. Congress become mere figureheads for their Soviet overseers.\n\nThe above events are implied in the miniseries, although never directly explained. The description is taken from the novelization of the miniseries, \"Amerika: The Triumph of the American Spirit\" by Brauna E. Pouns and Donald Wrye (Pocket Books, 1987), based on Wrye's screenplay. Communications between the administrative areas have been cut off, and the damage to the electrical grid caused by the EMP attack has never been fully repaired.\n\nA decade after its defeat, the contiguous United States is occupied by a United Nations peacekeeping force, the United Nations Special Service Unit (UNSSU), composed primarily of Communist state forces. The UNSSU in Milford is under a command of an officer from East Germany, Major Helmut Gurtman (played by Reiner Sch√∂ne). UNSSU troops periodically engage in destructive combined arms training exercises which are deliberately intimidating to the local population.\n\nThose Americans who engage in dissent are stripped of their privileges and sent to exile camps, where they are anathema to the Soviets and their fellow citizens. Association and communication with the exiles is prohibited and forbidden, although some risk their own remaining freedoms by offering humanitarian aid. Production quotas have been imposed, and foodstuffs rationed, with the surplus being shipped to the Soviet Union.\n\nAgainst this background, Bradford ascends to the leadership as Governor General of Heartland. He acts a collaborator, hoping to reform the Soviet occupation from within with ideals of the old United States. Milford is released from the prison camp, hoping to be reunited with his children and fight to end the occupation and restore the United States. Denisov hopes to \"salvage as much as possible\" of the old U.S., while realizing that the U.S. essentially must cease to exist as a nation in order to appease the Soviet Union's leadership.\n\nThe Soviet leaders of the occupation are faced with the dual problem of keeping the U.S. pacified and convincing the Politburo that their fears of a revitalized U.S. are unfounded because the country can no longer pose a threat. The Politburo is not convinced, and considers exploding nuclear weapons over four or five unnamed U.S. cities as a warning to the U.S. people and to the world. Samanov and Denisov, both of whom want Soviet control of the United States to be relatively humane, are horrified by this idea.\n\nAt great personal risk, Samanov convinces the Soviet leadership to accept a compromise plan. The United States will be divided into \"client states\", such as Heartland. Additionally, members of the United States Congress will be executed if they refuse to dissolve the nation's government and disperse in peace. After Samanov asks the assembled Congress to disband the legislative body and dissolve the United States government, the members angrily refuse to do so. Samanov walks out of the House of Representatives chamber and his men begin firing into the crowd of legislators. All the members of Congress are killed in the attack, along with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President. The United States Capitol building and the artwork in its rotunda are destroyed in a terrorist-style attack. After the act is carried out, Samanov surveys the damage and the dead bodies of the members of Congress. He then sits in the United States House of Representatives chamber and commits suicide.\n\nIn the final episode of the miniseries, Heartland is about to secede from the United States, with other regions to follow within the next few weeks. Instead, Heartland soldiers and local militia attack the local UNSSU compound. There is talk of a \"Second American Revolution\" that could undermine the Soviet Union's plans to break up the United States. The miniseries ends on a downbeat note, however, when Devin Milford is shot and killed as he is about to make a nationwide broadcast calling on Americans to resist the breakup of the United States. With Milford gone, the hopes to restore the United States through the resistance is muted. Although there is hope that the spirit of the U.S. lives on in the hearts and minds of some people, in the end it appears that the Soviet plan to dissolve the United States will come into being.\n\nSome sources have claimed that the finale of the miniseries was deliberately left unresolved to allow for the possibility of a weekly television series sequel; but such plans never materialized.\n\nIn this fictional timeline, the U.S. Congress divided the United States into multiple \"administrative areas\" in 1988, one year after the Communist takeover. These areas are intended to become polities modelled on the Soviet republics, joined together in a new North American Union. A map shown on screen reveals these administrative areas to be:\n\n\nIn addition to these areas, Washington, D.C. comprises its own National Administrative District, South Florida is described by a character as the \"Space Zone,\" and there is a passing reference to three \"International Cities,\" one of which is San Francisco. Michigan is separated into two administrative regions, with the Lower Peninsula belonging to Ameritech, and the Upper Peninsula belonging to the North Central region. Alaska is described as never having been pacified, requiring continued engagement by Soviet troops, and there are pockets of armed resistance in the Rocky Mountains and in West Virginia. There is no mention of what has happened to Hawaii, or to U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa.\n\nThe Rust Belt (presumably \"Ameritech\") faces its own special problems. Most of its advanced factory equipment was removed at the start of the occupation and taken to the Soviet Union. The region suffers 50% unemployment as a result, and its residents are not permitted to leave, except to volunteer for factory work in the Soviet Union, from which no one has yet returned.\n\nTravel and communications between the various zones is heavily restricted, part of the \"divide and conquer\" plan of the Soviet occupation.\n\nBoth the novel and miniseries imply that the Soviet Union has conquered other countries after the U.S. coup (it can be surmised, for example, that the EMP which disabled U.S. technology also would have crippled Canada and Mexico, a minor character says that he and his wife fled East Germany for the United States and remarked that \"the promised land [had] become worse than what [they] left\", and Denisov says at one point that \"we control most of the world\").\n\nIn this new world, Fidel Castro heads what is now called \"Greater Cuba\", embracing most of the Caribbean and Latin America, and Taiwan has been absorbed into China. North Korea has conquered and occupied South Korea and Korea is united under Communist rule. A politician named \"Mbele\" heads the \"Socialist Republic of Southern Africa\" which also includes South Africa, \"Barghout\" is the leader of \"Iraqistan\" which includes present day Israel and all of the Arab world in both the Middle East and North Africa. Eastern Europe is in a state of unrest, echoing the turmoil in the former United States. The Soviet leader mentions being stationed in England before being posted in America, implying that Western Europe is also under Soviet control, much like America.\n\nThe flag of the occupation is the pale blue United Nations flag, with crossed U.S. and Soviet flags superimposed on the sides. The U.S. flag is shown without its stars, and this flag is displayed during the \"Lincoln Week\" ceremonies. The standard U.S. flag is outlawed, although one scene shows a group of war veterans marching with the old U.S. flag upside down, this being a distress signal. The U.S. national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" also is outlawed, but this does not stop a group of citizens from singing it (haltingly at first) after the \"Lincoln Week\" parade.\n\nAbraham Lincoln is included with Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin in propaganda. One of the signature scenes in the film is a twenty-minute, dialogue-free depiction of the celebration of \"Lincoln Week\" (a holiday replacing the Fourth of July), with both Lincoln and Lenin displayed on red banners that were most likely intended to be striking and startling to television audiences of the time.\n\nA new Pledge of Allegiance is given by \"rehabilitated\" political prisoners upon release from the U.S. gulags. While the prisoners are told that they are free to refuse to make this pledge, the circumstances under which it is administered suggest otherwise. The pledge states: \n\nAlthough it aired only two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, \"Amerika\" implied that American apathy and an unwillingness to defend freedom on the part of many citizens made the Soviet takeover rather easy. At one point, a key Soviet official observes that their plans for conquering the United States succeeded far beyond their wildest dreams, because once the nation had been defeated, the U.S. turned inward, not caring about national issues, seeking only to retain a piece of the prosperity that had once been theirs. \"[The Soviet coup] worked because you lost your country before we ever got here,\" says the Soviet leader. \"You had political freedom, but you lost your passion [...] How could we not win?\"\n\nThis theme is echoed by Devin Milford later in the film:\n\nFurther dialogue, by politician Peter Bradford, lashes out at apathetic U.S. attitudes:\n\nA speech delivered by one child (Devin Milford's son) demonstrates the extent of Soviet indoctrination in the new U.S.:\n\nGeneral Samanov sums up the futility of the hypothetical Soviet domination:\n\nThe first two nights of \"Amerika\" garnered big ratings, but audience numbers dropped thereafter, and the overall miniseries averaged a 19 rating and a 29 share of American television households, compared to a 46 rating/62 share for \"The Day After\". \"It wasn't as big a hit as its supporters had hoped,\" said Ted Koppel, \"but it wasn't a disaster, either.\" \"Amerika\" was the second-highest rated miniseries of the 1986‚Äì87 U.S. television season.\n\nAlthough a 35 share reportedly had been promised to advertisers, Stoddard was happy with the performance of \"Amerika\", claiming that all or part of the miniseries had been watched by 100 million people ‚Äì a ratings bonanza for ABC, then in third place among the three major networks.\n\n\"Amerika\" received mixed reviews; the series created controversy with some. Certain critics and viewers felt it was too long and unrealistic, others argued that it would be damaging to Soviet-American relations, and a spokesperson for the United Nations objected to it being portrayed as an occupying force under Soviet control. Some conservatives felt that Soviet brutality was greatly underplayed; conversely, a number of liberals dismissed the entire miniseries as right-wing paranoia. At various points, the program was scrapped, delayed, and rewritten. Prior to the show's airing, several left-wing magazines, including \"The Nation\", \"The Progressive\", \"Tikkun\" and \"Mother Jones\" carried articles strongly criticizing \"Amerika\". The American Friends Service Committee also protested against \"Amerika\".\n\nFor its part, the Soviet Union threatened to shut down the ABC News Moscow bureau, although this threat was not carried out and indeed seemed to strengthen ABC's resolve regarding the miniseries.\"We‚Äôre going to run that program come rain, blood, or horse manure,\" said ABC president John B. Sias, after the yet-to-be-aired \"Amerika\" had generated more controversy and viewer response than any other ABC program in history, including \"The Day After\".\n\n\"Amerika\" was preceded by an ABC special addressing the considerable controversy prior to its airing (\"The Storm Over Amerika\"), and was followed by an \"ABC News Viewpoint\" panel discussion moderated by Ted Koppel, with Brandon Stoddard, Donald Wrye, and others addressing the issues along with questions and comments from a live studio audience in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nAfter seeing the first episode and reading the shooting script, Tom Engelhardt stated that \"Amerika\" had \"a plot line that makes suspension of disbelief into an act of grace.\" In its summary of the 1986‚Äì87 US television season, \"TV Guide\" called the miniseries \"arguably the most boring miniseries in a decade,\" adding that \"ABC's \"Amerika\" tried to hold America hostage for seven tedious nights (and a stupefyingly dull 14¬Ω hours) by conjuring up a fuzzy vision of a Communist occupation of the U.S.\"\n\n\"Amerika\" has been unseen on U.S. television since its original telecast on ABC. A VHS box set of the miniseries was released by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 1995, but no official DVD release is available. Portions of the soundtrack by Basil Poledouris were released on CD by Prometheus Records in 2004 (in a limited edition of 3,000 copies). The novelization is widely available from used-book sellers and online auction sites. The miniseries itself can be found pirated on YouTube.\n\nIn February 1987, the miniseries was parodied on the NBC show \"Saturday Night Live\" as \"Amerida,\" in which a debt-ridden United States is mortgaged to Canada and subsequently repossessed. It posited Wayne Gretzky as the Prime Minister of Amerida. The U.S. protagonist (played by Canadian actor Phil Hartman) longs for a country \"where you don't have money that's all the colours of the rainbow\" and \"you can spell words like colour and flavour without a 'u'.\" \nTo calm him down, his wife makes the offer of a beer: \"How about a Labatt's, eh?\" The flag of \"Amerida\" was the U.S. flag with the stars replaced by a white maple leaf.\n\nThe satirical Canadian radio program \"Double Exposure\" parodied the series in a sketch called \"Kanada with a K\", in which \"Joe Klark with a K\" rescues the nation from \"Comrade Ed\".\n\n\n"}

The name is derived from the circus barker, who stood outside a circus and shouted to passers-by to encourage them to enter to view the entertainment being provided by the attraction.\n\nThe systems are similar to character generators (CG), incorporating features such as motion graphics and have the ability to play video clips controlled by broadcast automation systems. \n\nSeveral barker channels exist on digital cable systems, and especially on direct broadcast satellite systems such as DirecTV. On interactive television systems, these also allow for ordering of pay-per-view program selections or other pay television services. Prior to its 2008 purchase by Lions Gate Entertainment and subsequent conversion into a general entertainment channel (eventually leading to its rebranding as Pop in January 2015), the TV Guide Network ‚Äì along with featuring listings for upcoming programs ‚Äì functioned essentially as a barker channel with film and program descriptions. During its years as Prevue Guide/Channel, it served as a barker channel outright, incorporating video program promotions and short-form film trailers at the top half of the screen.\n\nIn its Prevue incarnation, the channel operated a sister barker service, Sneak Prevue, which provided information on pay-per-view programming along with ordering information; the service operated until 2002 (three years after its parent network evolved into the TV Guide Channel), as a result of the rise in in-house barker channels operated by pay-per-view services to promote their content.\n\nBarker channels are normally free-to-view or occasionally free-to-air, even without a subscription; this also indicates success in the installation of satellite systems, and particularly in aiming small satellite dishes.\n\nAn example of a barker channel is the NBA League Pass Preview Channel, which is used to advertise and promote the NBA League Pass out-of-market sports package available to digital cable and satellite systems. In a technical form, specialty channels focused on a single sport such as NBA TV, NFL Network, NHL Network and MLB Network could be considered barkers, which may push devoted viewers into ordering those leagues' respective pay-per-view packages to watch complete game broadcasts.\n\nIn some occasions, the barker method is used on radio stations, looping 30 to 60 second messages leading to a pending format change, a process called \"stunting\".\n\n"}

{"id": "3904808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3904808", "title": "Brazilian hip hop", "text": "Brazilian hip hop\n\nBrazilian hip hop is a national music genre. From its earliest days in the African-Brazilian communities of S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro the genre has grown into a countrywide phenomena. Rappers, DJs, break dancers and graffiti artists are active across the complete spectrum of society blending Brazil's cultural heritage with American hip hop to form a contemporary musical fusion.\n\nBrazilian hip hop has its origins in the Bailes Black (Black Parties) of the late 1970s where American funk and soul music was played. These events, which tens of thousands of people attended regularly, had become an important forum for the expression of African-Brazilian identity during the absence of democracy; the military had assumed power in 1964 and would remain in power until 1985. The Bailes Black were orientated towards playing American imports by artists such as James Brown, Funkadelic and Parliament. The influence of \"Say It Loud ‚Äì I'm Black and I'm Proud\" by James Brown and the Civil Rights Movement is reflected in the names of the Brazilian Sound Teams (equivalent of the Jamaican Sound Systems): Black Power, Zimbabwe and Revolution of the Mind. The sound teams of the Bailes Black were soon providing opportunities for local Master of Ceremonies (MC) to take the stage and though the parties were still orientated towards American music they formed an important training ground for Brazilian rappers.\n\nBy the early 1980s the nascent Brazilian hip hop movement was centered around the city of S√£o Paulo especially S√£o Bento station, Galleria 24 de Maio Street and the Theatro Municipal where break dancers and rappers congregated to exchange ideas and information. In 1988 the first hip hop posse was formed by the rappers from Pra√ßa Roosevelt (Roosevelt Square) in S√£o Paulo; calling themselves the Sindicato Negro (Black Trade Union) they were directly involved in helping other posses in the city to organize. The first Brazilian hip hop album \"Hip Hop, Cultura De Rua\" (Hip Hop, Street Culture) was released in September 1988 on the Paralelo label; the album featured Thaide & DJ Hum, C√≥digo 13, MC Jack and O Credo. The second Brazilian hip hop album was \"Consci√™ncia Black Vol.1\" which featured \"P√¢nico na Zona Sul\" (Panic on the South Side) and \"Tempos Dif√≠ceis\" (Hard Times) by the group Racionais MC's as well as the song \"Nossos Dias\" (Our Days) by Sharylaine who was the first female rapper to make an impact in Brazil. The influence of the Universal Zulu Nation, a US hip hop organization created by Afrika Bambaataa as an alternative to gang culture, was emulated in Brazil with the formation of the Movimento Hip Hop Organizado do Brasil (MH2O) in 1989.\n\nThe hip hop group Posse Mente Zulu was formed in 1992 by Rappin' Hood, Johnny MC and DJ Akeen and released the track \"Sou Negr√£o\" that same year; the song with its blend of samba and hip hop elements was hugely popular and was later re-recorded by Rappin' Hood. The group Racionais MC's released their debut album \"Holocausto Urbano\" (Urban Holocaust) on Zimbabwe Records in 1992; over the course of the next five years they would establish themselves as one of Brazil's most important hip hop groups.\n\nNew era in coming, new rappers, new styles.\n\nCheckup to groups and artistas: Tribo da periferia, Nego Lizu, Costa Gold, Primeiramente, Hungria, Pregador Luo, ConeCrew, 100SEI, Pacificadores, Qdc beats and more.\n\nGOG, Genival Oliveira Gon√ßalves, was the first hip hop artist from the Brasilia hip hop scene to make an impact with the release in 1992 of the four-track album \"Peso Pesado\" (Heavy Weight). In February 1993 the first Brazilian hip hop magazine \"Pode Cr√™!\" (You Can Believe It!) was published by JP Publicidade, S√£o Paulo. The Brasilia group C√¢mbio Negro, formed in 1990 by DJ Jamaika and X, released their debut album \"Sub Ra√ßa\" in July 1993; its mixture of rock and hip hop proved to be popular with audiences. Racionas MC's released their third album \"Sobrevivendo no Inferno\" on their own independent label Cosa Nostra in 1997; the album was certified Gold in January 1998. The S√£o Paulo rap group RZO, formed in 1989 by Sandr√£o, Heli√£o and DJ Cia, released their self-titled debut album in 1997 on M.A. Records; they would later sign with the Cosa Nostra label.\n\nIn 1997, DJ Alpiste who is said to be the first evangelical rapper in S√£o Paulo, made his first commercial album. Alpiste‚Äôs music inspired gospel rapper Pregador Luo, founder of the gospel rap group Apocalipse 16.\n\nMV Bill, a resident of the favela Cidade de Deus (City of God), first became aware of hip hop music through the soundtrack of the 1988 US movie \"Colors\"; in 1998 he released his debut album \"Mandando Fechado\". DJ Jamaika released the album \"P√° Doido Pir√°\" in December 2000 on Warner Bros. In 2002 MV Bill released his second album \"Declara√ß√£o de Guerra\" (Declaration of War) and has since established himself as one of the most articulate and controversial hip hop artists in Brazil. The rapper Sabotage, from the South Zone in S√£o Paulo, achieved major success with the release of his debut album \"Rap √â Compromisso\" (Rap Is Commitment) in 2002 on the Cosa Nostra label; his promising career was brought to an end after he was killed in January 2003.\n\nThe second album \"A Procura da Batida Perfeita\" (Looking for the Perfect Beat) by the rapper Marcelo D2 was released in 2003; its fusion of samba and hip hop was a hit leading to an appearance on Ac√∫stico MTV where he performed acoustic versions of the tracks from the album. In 2006, GOG released the album \"Aviso √†s Gera√ß√µes\" (Notice to the Generations) which featured a collaboration with MC RAPadura on the song \"A quem possa interessar\". MC RAPadura had established his reputation in \"repente\" (improvised rap contests using Brazilian Forr√≥ music) and would later achieve success with his distinctive rapping style, which consists of mixing Hip Hop music with Forr√≥ and Bai√£o.\n\nEmicida is a rapper from S√£o Paulo who released his first single \"Triunfo\" in 2008 and is one of the first Brazilian hip hop artists to establish himself by posting his music on social networks and video sites. In 2008, the female rapper Flora Matos released the track \"Mundo Pequeno\" which was produced by DJ Cia, and directed by Mano Brown and Ice Blue of Racionais MC's. The track was featured on the compilation mixtape \"O Jogo √© Hoje\".\n\nInitially Brazilian hip hop was an assertion of African-Brazilian identity and a continuation of the ethos of the 1970s Bailes Black. As the genre gradually emerged, drawing new artists and audiences into its sphere, its themes widened to encompass a range of social and political issues. In 1993 Gabriel o Pensador, a writer and son of a prominent journalist, released the satirical rap song \"T√¥ Feliz, Matei o Presidente\" (I'm Glad, I've Killed the President) about the impeachment of former president Fernando Collor on corruption related charges. The mangue beat group Chico Science adhered to a musical style known as \"rap consciencia\" (socially conscious rap).\n\nThe television series \"Cidade dos Homens\" (City of Men) was created by the directors of the film \"City of God\". It was broadcast for four seasons on Globo TV between 2002 and 2005. It follows the fictional lives of two best friends, Luis Claud√≠o (nickname Acerola) and Uolace (nickname Laranjinha), who are growing up together in a favela of Rio de Janeiro. Funk carioca and hip hop forms the musical backdrop to their adventures and is featured prominently throughout the series. The episode \"Hip Sampa Hop \", in which Acerola and Laranjinha visit the city of S√£o Paulo, includes short interviews with the hip hop artists Xis, Thaide and Rappin' Hood.\n\nBrazilian hip hop and its relationship to the favela is the subject of the 2005 documentary \"Favela Rising\". The documentary details the efforts of the AfroReggae movement which was formed in 1993 by Anderson Sa and DJ Jose Junior with the express purpose of providing a cultural outlet for young people as an alternative to the favela gang culture through a series of non-profit schemes involving music and dance. AfroReggae are also a musical group that fuses traditional Brazilian dance music with hip hop and reggae.\n\nDerek Pardue in his article \"Hip Hop as Pedagogy\" examines the concepts of \"periferia\" (periphery) and \"marginalidade\" (marginality) in relation to hip hop identity as well as hip hop's potential pedagogical value. Pardue proposes that the common perception of hip hop as a US cultural entertainment phenomena reflecting exclusive themes of urban gang membership and masculinity may be discarded for a more realistic assessment of its educational benefits especially with regards to the young people of the favelas. Pardue cites the expansion of CEUs (Unified Educational Centers) into favelas and the employment of hip hop educationalists as examples of educational models that build upon earlier social and communal actions initiated by those from rural Brazil that settled on the outskirts of major Brazilian cities. Pardue highlights that many hip hop artists and residents from the favelas have formed educational NGOs and have actively participated in state sponsored schemes designed not only to improve the lives of those who are economically marginalized but also with a view of promoting hip hop as a positive contribution to citizenship within wider society. Pardue points out that hip hop educationalists realize the importance of hip hop and its role in the lives of the young people of the favelas and that its pedagogical value serves to benefit not only those on the periphery but also the wider aims of state education.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "762374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=762374", "title": "Buddy cop film", "text": "Buddy cop film\n\nA buddy cop film is a film with plots involving two people of very different and conflicting personalities who are forced to work together to solve a crime and/or defeat criminals, sometimes learning from each other in the process. The two are normally either police officers or secret agents (\"cops\"), but some films that are not about two officers may still be referred to as \"buddy cop films\". It is a subgenre of buddy films. They can be either comedies or thrillers.\n\nFrequently, although not always, the two heroes are of different ethnicity or cultures. However, regardless of ethnicity, the central difference is normally that one is \"wilder\" than the other: a hot-tempered iconoclast is paired with a more even-tempered partner. Often the \"wilder\" partner is the younger of the two, with the even-tempered partner having more patience and experience. These films sometimes also contain a variation on the good cop/bad cop motif, in which one partner is kinder and law-abiding, while the other is a streetwise, \"old school\" police officer who tends to break (or at least bend) the rules. Another frequent plot device of this genre is placing one of the partners in an unfamiliar setting (like a different city or foreign country) or role (like requiring police field work of a non-cop, rookie, or office-bound \"desk jockey\"). In these cases, they are usually guided by the other partner.\n\nIn his review of \"Rush Hour\", Roger Ebert coined the term \"Wunza Movie\" to describe this subgenre, a pun on the phrase \"One's a...\" that could be used to describe the contrasts between the two characters in a typical film.\n\nThe clich√© was satirized in the film \"Last Action Hero\". While the movie in itself was a buddy cop film (i.e. pairing a fictional cop with a real world boy), the film's police department obligatorily assigned all cops a conflicting buddy to work with, even to the extreme of one officer being partnered with a cartoon cat.\n\nA subgenre of the buddy cop film is the buddy cop-dog movie, which teams a cop with a dog, but uses the same element of unlikely partnership to create comedic hijinks. Examples include \"Turner & Hooch\", \"Top Dog\" and \"K-9\".\n\nAkira Kurosawa's 1949 Japanese film \"Stray Dog\", starring Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura, is considered a precursor to the buddy cop film genre. Other early pioneers of the buddy cop film genre are the 1967 American film \"In the Heat of the Night\" and 1974's \"Freebie and the Bean\". The genre was later popularized by the 1982 film \"48 Hrs.\", starring Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, one of the most successful buddy cop films. 1987 saw the buddy cop genre reach its apex when Lethal Weapon made a theatrical debut. 1989 saw the release of \"Tango and Cash\", starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell.\n"}

By 2006 the company reported 30,000 members using the site to sell music through its network. In 2007 the company was sued by the Federal Trade Commission for being an illegal pyramid scheme. The company lost the suit in 2012, and lost appeal in June 2014. In June 2015, the FTC began returning $1.9 million to people who had lost money in the scheme. The company is dormant pending additional appeals.\n\nBurnLounge was founded in 2004, with offices in New York City. Its primary business was the BurnLounge online music store, and it was associated with Orbital Publishing, which produced printed matter for the company. Former CEO Alex Arnold (formerly with Excel Communications and founder and former chairman of NuEWorld.com).\n\nDescribed by Gartner G2 as a multi-level marketing company, BurnLounge used the term \"concentric retail\" to describe its business model.\n\nThe company's site allowed customers to preview and purchase music, and chat through a proprietary client. Customers wishing to sell music through their own custom pages were required to purchase a subscription. Subscription costs varied, and consisted of either an annual fee or an annual fee with an additional monthly charge. These fees only allowed one to redeem sales points for BurnLounge products; participants paid additional fees if they wished to exchange earned sales points for money. A \"Fortune\" article places the commission at five cents per 99-cent download.\n\nIn 2006 the company stated that nearly 30,000 people had opened BurnLounge storefronts, including several major label musicians. The service provided content supplied by Muze, with early versions of its software provided by Beatport and SocialIM. Version 0.9 of the software was introduced in October 2005, and version 1.0 was unveiled in Las Vegas on June 9 and 10, 2006. BurnLounge offered only music downloads, but other products such as audiobooks, video, ring tones, and physical merchandise were said to be planned. Burnlounge 2.0 (or BL2) launched quietly on Friday, April 27, 2007.\n\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit on June 5, 2007 against specific BurnLounge participants for involvement in a pyramid scheme. The FTC claimed that BurnLounge is a pyramid scheme because the company pays more money for recruiting new store owners than for selling music. The lawsuit claimed that BurnLounge made very little money from the sale of music, and made the vast majority of its money from independent associates (named \"moguls\") paying between $29.95 and $429.95 a year plus fees, for the right to sell music. The lawsuit also stated that associates were paid a cash reward for recruiting others into the program.\n\nOne person named in the lawsuit, Rob DeBoer, says that he recruited about 45 other people to open their own BurnLounge sites. Those recruited would then pay a commission on their sales to DeBoer. DeBoer stated that he made almost US$300,000 from BurnLounge. The lawsuit is the result of a year-long investigation into BurnLounge by the state of South Carolina. Others named in the lawsuit include former BurnLounge CEO Alex Arnold, and two Texas men who promoted BurnLounge similarly to DeBoer. The case went before a Federal Judge in December 2008, and while many of the accusations against the company were dropped by the FTC, on February 29, 2012 an order was issued barring the defendants from operating a pyramid scheme and ordering them to pay some $17 million in damages.\n\nIn June 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the ruling, declaring BurnLounge to be an illegal pyramid scheme. BurnLounge was considering appeal to the Supreme Court. Multi-level marketing analysts describe the ruling as being likely significant to an FTC investigation of Herbalife. Herbalife praised the ruling, saying that it clarified that its own business model does not fall under the appellate court's definition of pyramid scheme.\n\nIn June 2015, the FTC began mailing checks to consumers who had lost money in the pyramid scheme. The FTC was mailing 52,099 checks totaling almost $1.9 million. The company is dormant pending additional appeals. As of November 2018, the company's website hosts a teaser promoting BurnLounge 3.0 with the statement, \"Get ready\", which has remained unchanged for over ten years.\n\n"}

{"id": "39124659", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39124659", "title": "Cercle Funambulesque", "text": "Cercle Funambulesque\n\nThe Cercle Funambulesque (1888-1898)‚Äîroughly translatable as \"Friends of the Funambules\"‚Äîwas a Parisian theatrical society that produced pantomimes inspired by the Commedia dell'Arte, particularly by the exploits of its French Pierrot. It included among its approximately one hundred and fifty subscriber-members such notables in the arts as the novelist J.-K. Huysmans, the composer Jules Massenet, the illustrator Jules Ch√©ret, and the actor Coquelin cadet. Among its successes was \"L'Enfant prodigue\" (1890), which was filmed twice, first in 1907, then in 1916, making history as the first European feature-length movie and the first complete stage-play on film.\n\nFrom about 1825 to 1860, the theater-goers of Paris were witness to a Golden Age of Pantomime. At the Th√©√¢tre des Funambules, Jean-Gaspard Deburau, called by the eminent poet and journalist Th√©ophile Gautier \"the most perfect actor who ever lived\", created, in his celebrated mute Pierrot, a legendary, almost mythic figure, immortalized by Jean-Louis Barrault in Marcel Carn√©'s film \"Children of Paradise\" (1945). After his death, his son Charles, playing at the same theater, revived for the grateful enthusiasts of the genre his father's agility and gaity; and Charles's rival Paul Legrand, who reinvented Pierrot as the sensitive soul so familiar to post-nineteenth-century devotees of the figure, earned warm admiration from his public (including Gautier) for his performances at the Folies-Nouvelles. But, by the early 1860s, interest in the pantomime, at least in the capital, had begun to flag, and both Legrand and Deburau \"fils\" had to seek out audiences elsewhere. Deburau died young, in 1873, having taken his art to Marseille and Bordeaux, where he founded a so-called school of pantomime. Legrand, after working in Bordeaux and abroad, found employment in the 1870s at the Tertulia, a Parisian \"caf√©-concert\", and in the late 1880s, at the end of his career, at a children's theater, the Th√©√¢tre-Vivienne. Both venues represented a considerable step down from the Folies-Nouvelles. One of the historians of French pantomime, Robert Storey, writes that Legrand, in these years, \"seems to have been forgotten by his public, the pantomime itself suffering death-throes at the capital while struggling for rebirth in the south of France.\" When the mime made an appearance, around 1880, in a pantomime at the Vari√©t√©s, he struck Paul and Victor Margueritte, rare admirers of his art, as \"a survivor of a quite distant epoch.\"\n\nIt would be the self-assumed task of one of those brothers, Paul Margueritte, to revive the pantomime. In 1882, Paul sent his just-published \"Pierrot assassin de sa femme\" (Pierrot, Murderer of His Wife), a pantomime he had devised the previous year for the audiences of his amateur theatricals in Valvins, to several writers, hoping to renew interest in the genre. It apparently found a receptive spirit in Jean Richepin, whose \"Pierrot assassin\", also a pantomime, appeared at the Trocad√©ro in 1883. (It would hardly go unnoticed: Sarah Bernhardt was its titular Pierrot.) And other forces were at work to promote the pantomime with the general public. In 1879, the Hanlon-Lees, a troupe of English acrobatic mimes, had performed to great acclaim at the Folies-Berg√®re, inspiring J.-K. Huysmans, the Naturalistic novelist and future creator of the arch-aesthete Des Esseintes, to collaborate on a pantomime with his friend . Their \"Pierrot sceptique\" (Pierrot the Skeptic, 1881) presented its readers with a dandified Pierrot even more savage than Margueritte's or Richepin's assassin: for he not only murders his tailor and executes a mannikin he has lured to his chambers, but also sets fire to the rooms themselves to obliterate all evidence of his crimes. Such waggish ferocity delighted the young Jules Laforgue, who, upon reading the pantomime, produced his own \"Pierrot fumiste\" (Pierrot the Cut-up, 1882), in which Pierrot is guilty of similar (if not homicidal) enormities.\n\nWhile these writers were refining an art that elevated Pierrot to criminal heights, others were imagining a pantomime animated by a much more conventional Pierrot. The \"Petit Trait√© de pantomime √† l'usage des gens du monde\" (1887), by the mime and scenarist Raoul de Najac, championed the pantomime as a recreation for the \"salons\"‚Äîand reminded its readers that, in devising such an entertainment, \"One must ... not forget that one is in good company.\" Najac's ideal Pierrot, consequently, is innocent of all \"indecent or funereal ideas,\" like those that motivate Pierrot \"sceptique\". Such also had been the pure-hearted Pierrot of Legrand, a collection of whose pantomimes was published‚Äîin the same year as Najac's treatise‚Äîby two fraternal men of the theater, Eug√®ne and F√©lix Larcher. In undertaking their collaboration, the Larchers discovered talents and ambitions in themselves, vis-√†-vis the pantomime, that neither knew he possessed. Eug√®ne, in incarnating the Pierrot of one of Legrand's pantomimes, \"Le Papillon\" (The Butterfly), found that he was a more-than-competent mime, and F√©lix was inspired by his brother's performance to conceive the Cercle Funambulesque.\n\nThrough friendships and professional contacts, F√©lix was introduced to Najac, Paul Margueritte, and Fernand Beissier, a colleague of Margueritte's who had written the preface for \"Pierrot assassin de sa femme\". He persuaded them to join him as founding members of the Cercle and drew up the goals of the society. Paul Hugounet, whom Storey calls the \"most energetic publicist and chronicler\" of the Cercle, summarized those goals in his \"Mimes et Pierrots\" of 1889:\n\n1. To revive the classical pantomime [i.e., the pantomimes of the Deburaux and their successors].2. To encourage the development of the modern pantomime by providing authors and musical composers the opportunity of producing publicly their works in this genre, whatever the artistic tendencies of those works may be.3. To return to the stage the \"parades\" and farces of the old Th√©√¢tre de la Foire, as well as the works known as \"improvised comedies\".4. To present the plays of the Com√©die-Italienne.5. To stage, eventually, new comedies, in verse or in prose, on the formal condition that these works have some express relationship, in their general makeup, to the old Italian comedies or the Commedia dell'Arte.\n\nThe Cercle grew rapidly. By the time of its first constitutive assembly in February 1888, it boasted seventy-five members, including many of the leading celebrities of the day, among them actors (Paul Legrand, Coquelin cadet), playwrights (Jules Lema√Ætre, Jacques Normand, Paul Eudel, F√©lix Galipaux), novelists (Champfleury, J.-K. Huysmans, , Jean Richepin), painters (Jules Ch√©ret, Jules Garnier), composers (Jules Massenet, Francis Thom√©), and critics and historians of the theater (L√©opold Lacour, Arthur Pougin, Edouard Stoullig). Its first evening of performances, in May 1888, at a small concert hall at 42, rue de Rochechouart, consisted of a prologue with verses by Jacques Normand accompanied by the miming of Paul Legrand; a pantomime, \"Colombine pardon√©e\" (Columbine Pardoned), written by Paul Margueritte and Beissier, its Pierrot mimed by Paul himself; Najac's pantomime \"L'Amour de l'art\" (The Love of Art), with Eug√®ne Larcher as Harlequin; and a \"parade\" of the boulevards, \"L√©andre Ambassadeur\" (Ambassador Leander), starring F√©licia Mallet, who would later create memorable Pierrots for the Cercle. Almost all subsequent performances would be held at the small Th√©√¢tre d'Application, later called La Bodini√®re.\n\nAs Tristan R√©my has pointed out, \"each of the promoters\"‚Äîthat is, the founders of the Cercle‚Äî \"had personal projects, projects that were disparate, that were even opposed to one another\". Margueritte was doubtful that any \"society\", such as the Cercle aspired to be, could appreciate the kinds of pantomime that he had written or wished to write. His ideal was what he called the \"Th√©√¢tre-Impossible\":\nOn the elastic boards of a house with scenery painted by the most fervid colorists and pervaded by strains of the \"enervating and caressing\" music of the most suave musicians, it would charm me if, for the amusement of a few simple‚Äîor very complicated‚Äîsouls, there could be presented the prodigious and tragicomic farces of life, love, and death, written exclusively by authors who had no connection whatsoever with the Society of Men of Letters.\nNajac, on the other hand, was repulsed by Margueritte's criminal Pierrot and offended when the Cercle turned his pantomime \"Barbe-Bluette\" (Pink-Beard, 1889) into an \"old melodrama rejuvenated by indecent innuendoes.\" And, like Margueritte, he \"had wanted,\" as Storey observes, \"a close circle of associates, committed to the pantomime in a spirit of comradeship\". The Larchers had grander plans: as F√©lix told Paul Hugounet, \"we wanted‚Äîstill while preserving the Cercle form, such as I had sketched out in the statutes‚Äîto approximate a theatrical organization, which, in our opinion, had the only chance of succeeding.\" The Larchers' model was the Th√©√¢tre-Libre of Antoine‚Äî\"with this difference: we resisted the intervention of amateur actors.\" Their ambitions went farther: the \"conventional and unintelligible gestures of the old pantomime\" were to be suppressed; the music was to follow closely the business on stage, putting \"the utterance of the gesture into the orchestra\"; in short, \"the best theories of Wagner\" were to be applied to the pantomime. Hugounet later even went so far as to interview the composers of the Cercle on their response to \"the Wagnerian tradition.\" The upshot was predictable: Margueritte and Najac withdrew from the Cercle, and Margueritte's friend Beissier followed suit. The result was an organization that was very different from what they had imagined: the Cercle strove to please its public‚Äîwhile encouraging its authors to embrace what was then the theatrical vanguard. As such, it would seem to its critics both \"au-courant\" and anodyne.\n\nAs Larcher's words and especially his allusion to Wagner suggest, his focus was almost exclusively upon the pantomime, and his chief intention was to persuade the Cercle to \"modernize\" it. Hougunet seems to have been eager to push the pantomimic envelope, but his work proved problematic. On the one hand, there was the threat of unintelligibility, to which his pantomime \"La Fin de Pierrot\" (Pierrot's End, 1891) appears to have succumbed. Here, true to the ideals of the avant-garde Symbolists, Pierrot is urged by Hermonthis, a kind of Salom√© \"√† la\" Gustave Moreau, to renounce the pleasures of the senses‚Äîall nourishment, love, and even life itself. He does so and is granted the \"treasure of his dreams\". Even the reviewer of \"La Plume\", usually an ally of the Symbolists, could not make sense of the piece.\n\nOn the other hand, there was intelligible pantomimic territory into which the authors of the Cercle could not trespass. In expanding its membership far beyond the \"close circle of associates\" desired by their fellow-founders, the Larchers, perhaps inadvertently, ensured that mass opinion and mass taste ruled. The result was, inevitably, censorship, which meant that not radical modernity but a certain mediocrity prevailed. When, for example, a jealous Pierrot disguised in a cassock sneaked into the priest's side of the confessional in \"Pierrot confesseur\" (Pierrot-Confessor, 1892), a piece by Galipaux and Pontsevrez, what Hugounet called the \"terrible representatives of the Censorship of the Cercle\" appointed two auditors to make cuts in the libretto and so stave off potential offense. The final curtain of Hugounet's own \"Doctoresse!\" (1890) finds physician Isabelle (like Hermonthis, a \"femme fatale\"), who has already been guilty of strangling a canary, plotting the dissection of her unfaithful husband. Although this ending, as F√©lix Larcher recalled, \"pleased some by its very boldness\",\n... the majority of us thought it impossible on the stage. On one point everyone was in agreement: the murder of the bird, an act of coldblooded cruelty, rendered Isabelle utterly odious. The author yielded easily: he even admitted the possibility of another d√©nouement and, at the following meeting, he brought us the one that ends the play today.\nThe new version ends as a comedy: the husband and his lover, Columbine, having expired in a suicide pact, are brought back to life by one of Isabelle's electrical machines, and, as they stagger about like robots, the \"doctoresse\" reveals her new shingle: \"Resurrections My Specialty\".\n\n\"The reforms of the Cercle\", writes Robert Storey, \"were in fact very timid reforms. Pathos was permissible‚Äîwas, indeed, encouraged‚Äîbut rarely cruelty or irreverence.\" And obscenity, of course, was out of the question. This helps, in part, to explain the Cercle's ignoring two of its own statutes. The Pierrot of Jean-Gaspard Deburau often flirted with the obscene, and the Gilles of the boulevard \"parades\" fully reveled in it. It is not, therefore, surprising that, during the ten years of the Cercle's existence, it produced only one \"classical\" pantomime (J.-G. Deburau's \"Pierrot Coiffeur\") and only one \"parade\", \"L√©andre Ambassadeur\", on its second and first evening of performances respectively, \"when the statutes were being conscientiously observed.\" And, despite their explicit inclusion in the statutes, no plays from the Th√©√¢tre de la Foire or the Com√©die-Italienne were mounted: the theater of the past was shouldered aside by \"the Wagnerian tradition\". \"Modernity\" reigned, in other words‚Äîbut it was modernity of a rather pallid kind. \"The Cercle\", writes Storey, \"was, despite its intentions, the very triumph of banality.\" He summarizes the plots of several of its pantomimes:\nPierrot loses his fianc√©e when his \"art\"‚Äîof thievery‚Äîinspires him to reckless heights (Najac's \"L'Amour de l'art\" [1888]); he botches his own suicide and then, stuffing the noose in his pocket for luck, is emboldened to court Colombine ([Fernand] Boussenot's \"La Corde de pendu\" [1892]); he plays out a dream of heroic exploit that leads \"alla gloria militar\" ([Henri] Ferdal's \"La R√®ve du conscrit\" [1892]). ... Sometimes his drama has a hackneyed lesson to teach: Woman is fickle (Camille de Saint-Croix's \"Blanc et noir\" [1888]); Earth's the right place for love (Beissier's \"La Lune\" [1889]). ... Sometimes it is tearful, in the manner of the old-fashioned \"com√©die-larmoyante\"...\n\nAlthough the Cercle left behind no enduring monuments of the theater, it provided a stage, orchestra, and audience to thirty-nine authors who, over the course of fourteen evenings of production, presented sixty-five playlets performed by and before (along with the paying public) its some hundred and fifty members. It even had significant successes, producing pantomimes that moved to stages outside the Bodini√®re and even outside the country. One of the most notable of these was \"L'Enfant prodigue\" (Pierrot the Prodigal, 1890) by Michel Carr√© \"fils\", in which a provincial Pierrot, seeking his fortunes in Paris, is disabused of his illusions by the decadence of the city and of his mistress, the faithless Phrynette; he returns to his home, a prodigal, to beg the forgiveness of M√®re and P√®re Pierrot. Not only did the panto find audiences in London, at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1891, and in New York, at the Booth Theatre in 1916, but it was revived in Paris in various commercial theaters well into the late 1920s. (Laurette Taylor starred in a New York revival in 1925.) It was, moreover, instrumental in offering a footing to the fledgling art of film: Carr√© directed the first celluloid version in 1907. Featuring the mime Georges Wague as P√®re Pierrot, it premi√®red as the first European feature-length film and the first uncut stage-play on screen.\n\nThe Cercle opened up other avenues, as well. It both welcomed the work of mimes outside Paris, such as that of Hacks from Marseille and Mour√®s from Bordeaux, and allowed female mimes the freedom to assume male roles: F√©licia Mallet, \"the brightest star of the Cercle\", was the prodigal of \"L'Enfant prodigue\". Finally, it brought to the fore the possibilities of \"modern\" pantomime, sometimes arguing, through articles in the press or lectures given under the auspices of the Cercle, that the genre should dispense with its ties to the Commedia dell'Arte and venture into \"realistic\" territory. (As early as 1889, the pantomime \"Lysic\" by Eug√®ne Larcher had entertained the Cercle audience with a provincial maid's misadventures in Paris.) Thus did the work of the Cercle anticipate such twentieth-century creations as Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp, Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot, Red Skelton's Freddie the Freeloader, and Jackie Gleason's Poor Soul.\n\n\n"}

The shutdown of the analogue equivalent started on September 19, 2005, and was finalized on October 15, 2007.\n\nThe network uses the DVB-T-standard and broadcasts several free-to-air and encrypted channels on a number of multiplexes. The majority of the channels are encrypted and viewing them requires a decoding card.\n\nOn April 9, 1997, the Swedish Riksdag decided that digital terrestrial television (DTT) was to be introduced in Sweden. In June 1998, the government decided which channels were to broadcast in the network. The channels that received a national license were: TV3, Kanal 5, Canal+, Kunskaps-TV i Sverige (to be K World), TV8 and Cell Internet Commerce Development (eTV) in addition to SVT1, SVT24 and TV4. Originally, only two multiplexes were planned and therefore SVT2 was omitted. However, before the launch a third multiplex was decided on and SVT2 would be allowed to broadcast.\n\nTwo companies were created to handle the encryption services, as all channels would be encrypted: Senda i Sverige who managed the system and decoding cards and Boxer who rented out set-top-boxes.\n\nThe digital terrestrial television network was launched on April 1, 1999, making Sweden the second country in Europe to launch digital terrestrial television. It then contained only SVT1, SVT2 and SVT24. Five regional SVT channels launched some months later.\n\nPrivate companies didn't launch until the autumn when TV3, TV4, Kanal 5, TV8, K World, Canal+ and eTV launched. Canal+ were granted two extra licenses to broadcast Canal+ Gul and Canal+ Bl√•. Boxer started their business in the autumn.\n\nThe take-up was slow at first. When the network had been running for six months, only about 500 households had rented the necessary set-top-boxes.\n\nNew licenses were granted in January 2000. A fourth multiplex was launched in the spring. After this, the DTT network looked like this:\n\nMTG said they weren't allowed to use commercial breaks in the terrestrial network. The commercial break were replaced by captions. Kanal 5 did however continue broadcasting their commercial breaks as they did on satellite. In January 2001, MTG introduced an extra fee of 115 SEK for TV3, ZTV and TV8 to cover the losses made as they didn't broadcast advertising.\n\nIn June 2001, MTG decided to cease their terrestrial broadcasts in August, which they did. As they didn't broadcast anything at all, the license was taken back, making MTG claim that they were thrown out of the DTT network.\n\nThe five MTG were replaced by other channels during the autumn of 2001: Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, MTV Nordic, Nickelodeon/VH1 and Eurosport. TV4 were granted a license to broadcast CNN International.\n\nDuring 2002, both eTV and K World went bankrupt. The SVT regional channels were closed down and replaced by an event channel called SVT Extra. NonStop Television started broadcasting a channel called E! in the autumn. Senda and Boxer merged on October 1, 2002, to form the new Boxer TV Access.\n\nIn December 2002, SVT launched the children's channel Barnkanalen followed in February 2003 by a relaunch of SVT24. TV4 launched their first major digital channel TV4 Plus, now Sjuan, in March.\n\nDuring 2003 and 2004 the sale of set-top-boxes increased after several years of financial difficulties.\n\nThe shutdown of the analogue network was decided on in the spring of 2003.\n\nIn 2004 the launch of a fifth multiplex and more efficient compression made it possible to allow more channels to launch: Disney Channel, TV3, ZTV, TV4 Film, TV8, TCM, BBC World, Discovery Travel & Adventure and Showtime. This meant that MTG returned to the DTT network. They did broadcast free-to-air for some months, but in August they decided to scramble their broadcasts. 2004 also saw the launch of Kunskapskanalen from SVT and UR. At the end of 2004, the DTT networked looked like this:\n\nIn early 2005, TV8 was moved to MUX 3 which had higher coverage than MUX 5, which at start only covered 50 percent of the households. Several changes were made to the local programmes during 2005. TV4 started making their local stations available in the digital network (previously TV4 Stockholm was shown nationwide) and SVT started providing an alternative local output so the viewer could choose to watch a neighbouring region. New regional commercial channels started: ByTV J√§mtland in J√§mtland and Kanal Lokal in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Sk√•ne.\n\nOn September 19, 2005, the island of Gotland became the first region to have its analogue transmitters turned off. This continued during the autumn when the G√§vle and Motala transmitters were shut down.\n\nThe fact that only the SVT channels, TV4 and the local channels were available free-to-air was a problem during the switch-off as those affected didn't feel they got enough in return for the trouble of having to buy set-top-boxes and in some cases a new antenna.\n\nWhen new licenses for 2006 were pending, the Minister of Education and Culture Leif Pagrotsky stated that those broadcasters who were going to broadcast free-to-air would be more likely to receive a new license. New licenses were awarded in February 2006. This meant that:\n\nIn June 2006, SVT and TV4 did broadcast the 2006 FIFA World Cup in high-definition on temporary frequencies from a few transmitters. Those frequencies were taken back when the World Cup ended.\n\nIn December 2006, the new right-wing government decided that a sixth multiplex would be taken into regular use, initially only to secure that the broadcasts of TV Finland would be secured when the transmitter of the capital region was turned off.\n\nThe Boxer monopoly on pay television was criticized by the European Commission and on October 17, 2006, it announced would be taking Sweden to the European Court of Justice as the country had failed to abolish the monopoly.\n\nSBS Broadcasting decided to replace ONE Television with a new channel called Kanal 9 in February 2007. With the launch of Kanal 9, they were allowed to adjust the Kanal 9/The Voice TV timeshare.\n\nOn May 26, 2007, SVT HD was launched on the remaining capacity of the multiplex that broadcast TV Finland, broadcasting HDTV programmes from four transmitters around the capital using MPEG-4 AVC compression.\n\nOn March 27, 2008, new broadcasts licenses were announced by the Radio and TV Authority (RTVV). This was the first time that the RTVV issued broadcast licenses and not government. New channels granted national licenses were Comedy Central, Discovery Science, Jetix, National Geographic Channel, Showtime, TV4 Sport, TV1000 and Viasat Sport 1. In addition, new regional licenses were given to 24nt, 24 V√§stra G√∂taland, Bor√•s Tidning TV, Kanal 12 and ST TV as well as Kanal Lokal in Dalarna, G√§vleborg, J√§mtland, Norrbotten, V√§sternorrland, Sm√•land and Blekinge.\n\nOut of the new channels, Discovery Science, National Geographic Channel, Showtime, Jetix, TV1000 and Viasat Sport 1 would be put in the new sixth national multiplex. I addition, BBC World and Discovery Travel & Living would move to this multiplex. The new multiplex would use the newer H.264/MPEG-4 AVC compression which would allow ten channels to broadcast from one network simultaneously, as opposed to the older, less efficient, MPEG-2 used by the existing multiplexes.\n\nSome channels got new broadcasting hours. Axess TV could start broadcasting the entire week, Aftonbladet TV7 and Canal 7 would timeshare so TV7 broadcast during the daytime and Canal 7 during the evening and night, VH1 got to broadcast between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., Nickelodeon had its hours extended, reducing those of Star!.\n\nThe new licenses also stipulated that TV7, The Voice TV and Star! would have to move to the sixth multiplex on January 1, 2009. This makes TV7, Canal 7, Kanal 9, The Voice TV and Star! to become 24-hour channels and also provides the space where Comedy Central will broadcast.\n\nAs of 2010 the following line up is as follow:\n\nAs of May 2016:\n\n"}

The site is the location of the British Broadcasting Corporation's most powerful long-wave transmitter, which together with the two Scottish long-wave transmitters at Burghead and Westerglen forms a network broadcasting on the same frequency. The masts can be seen to the east from the M5 motorway, between Droitwich and Bromsgrove, as well as to the west from the Herefordshire/Worcestershire border. At night, the two sets of aircraft warning lights are visible from a long distance. Due to the bright red lights illuminated at night, some locals have renamed the site \"the devil horns of Wychbold\". The station is owned and operated by Arqiva.\n\nThe long-wave frequency used was 200¬†kilohertz (frequently referred to by the wavelength, 1,500 metres) until 1 February 1988 when it was changed to 198¬†kilohertz, and the power is currently 500¬†kilowatts. The carrier frequency is controlled by a rubidium atomic frequency standard in the transmitter building, enabling the transmission to be used as an off-air frequency standard. For long-wave, a T-aerial is used, which is suspended between two guyed steel lattice radio masts, which stand apart from each other. There are also two guyed mast radiators at the site, which are used for transmitting AM medium-wave radio programmes on 693¬†kilohertz, 1053¬†kilohertz and 1215¬†kilohertz.\n\nBBC Radio 4 Longwave is transmitted on 198 kHz. This signal also carries radio data encoded using phase modulation, giving a time-of-day signal, and radio teleswitch control signals for Economy 7 electric-heating systems.\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live is broadcast on 693¬†kHz medium wave (MW), providing coverage for most of the English Midlands and Wales at a signal strength (150¬†kW) which is one of the strongest for that station, equal to Brookmans Park and second only to Moorside Edge.\n\nDuring World War II coded messages, read during normal programme broadcasts, were sent to the French Resistance using the transmitter.\n\nIn 2011 as part of the BBC cuts it was announced that there would be no re-investment in long wave which may mean an eventual end to BBC Radio 4 in this part of the radio spectrum. \"The Guardian\" published a story in October 2011 saying that the transmitter relies upon a pair of glass valves, of which there are fewer than 10 left in the world, and the BBC did not believe it was safe enough to manufacture more.\n\nThe Radio 4 LW signal from Droitwich covers most of England and Wales. There are supplementary long-wave transmitters in Scotland (Burghead and Westerglen, both 50¬†kW), with medium-wave transmitters in various parts of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The station can also be heard clearly in most of the Republic of Ireland, particularly along eastern and southern counties. Reception is also possible in Western Europe, including Italy.\n\n\n"}

Also known as Eamon de Longphort, he was a member of the fifth Seanad √âireann, the upper house of the Irish Parliament, in the 1940s.\n\nEdward Longford was the elder son of Thomas Pakenham, 5th Earl of Longford and Mary, Countess of Longford, \"n√©e\" Child-Villiers. He was the only one of the Pakenham children on whom his mother doted, apparently because he would succeed to the earldom on his father's death and because he was always in delicate health.\n\nAs a pupil at Eton College (where he twice received the Wilder Divinity Prize) he succeeded to the earldom when his father was killed in action at the Battle of Gallipoli on 21 August 1915.\n\nHe became an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford and met his future wife, Christine Patti Trew, an Oxford \"undergraduette\". They were married on 18 July 1925. He died without issue and was succeeded by his younger brother Frank.\n\nHe was an Irish Nationalist since his days at Eton, taking inspiration from the Easter Rising in 1916 and the Russian Revolution of 1917. He learned Irish and adopted the name Eamon de Longphort. His political views made him unpopular at both Eton and Christ Church, where he was famously put in \"Mercury\", the pond containing a statue of Mercury in Tom Quad.\n\nHe was an Anglo-Catholic who never left the Church of Ireland.\n\nOn 13 November 1946 he was nominated by the Taoiseach, √âamon de Valera as a member of 5th Seanad √âireann, filling a vacancy caused by the death of Professor William Magennis. He was not re-appointed to the 6th Seanad.\n\nLord Longford became Chairman of the Gate Theatre in Dublin in 1930 and continued to work for the theatre until 1936, when he founded the Longford Players.\n\nHis plays include \"Ascendancy\", \"The Melians\", \"The Vineyard\", and \"Yahoo\" (about Jonathan Swift). An excellent linguist and Classical scholar, he translated \"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme\", \"Le Malade Imaginaire\", \"L'√©cole des femmes\", \"Tartuffe\", and \"Le Barbier de S√©ville\" (from French) and \"Agamemnon\" and \"Oedipus Rex\" (or \"Oedipus Tyrannus\") (from Greek) and adapted the novella \"Carmilla\" for the stage.\n\nHe often collaborated with his wife, Christine, with whom he was also responsible for redecorating Pakenham Hall, now Tullynally Castle, in Chinese style.\n\nPakenham Hall was often the scene of gatherings of Oxford-educated intellectuals such as John Betjeman, Evelyn Waugh, and Maurice Bowra.\n\nLord Longford also had several volumes of poetry published, some at the expense of his mother when he was still at Eton, but he is not considered to have been a very good poet.\n\nLord Longford is buried at Mount Jerome Cemetery in Dublin.\n\n\n \n"}

Lewis became further engaged while attending high school at Walter Payton College Prep, after attending primary school in the less-affluent, majority African American South Side. In 2015, when she was a junior in high school, Lewis founded the non-profit The I Project. The I Project supports intersectional activism through art, with fundraising and community outreach. Events have included a photo shoot for people of all sizes and shapes, with a discussion of culture and body image, and a screening of Beyonc√©'s Lemonade with inter-generational panel discussion. \n\nIn 2016, Lewis joined three other black teen women activists to organize a youth sit-in in Chicago, to protest police shootings of people of color, particularly Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. The organizers rallied young community members on social media, with a Facebook event and the hashtag #BLMCHIYouth. The four organizers led a crowd of over 1,000 (some sources say 2,000) people in a peaceful sit-in in Millennium Park, and a march down Michigan Avenue and State Street (Chicago). There were no arrests, a symbolic victory because of the reputation of violence in Chicago, especially among youth of color, and a strained relationship between anti-racism activists and Chicago police. Following the march, Lewis and the organizers started Youth for Black Lives (Y4BL) to activate youth voices against systemic oppression. With Y4BL, Lewis organized a second march beginning in Millennium Park on August 7, 2016, to protest police brutality following the death of Paul O'Neal. In November 2016, in response to a deadly police shooting in Mount Greenwood, Chicago and racist text messages sent among students of Marist High School (Chicago, Illinois), Y4BL organized another march. However, Lewis and the organizers received threats on social media, and CPS leadership contacted the organizers parents, and the march was cancelled due to safety concerns. Instead, Y4BL organized meetings with Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson. The first, held on November 11, 2016, included Johnson, the Chief of Patrol, the Alderman of Mt. Greenwood, and the principle of Marist High School. During the first and subsequent meetings, Lewis and the other Y4BL members questioned Johnson and discussed racism and policing in Mt. Greenwood and Chicago at large. \n\nThrough her decade of involvement with the Girl Scouts of the USA, Lewis participated in the United Nations‚Äô 60th Annual Commission on the Status of Women in New York in March 2016. Lewis spoke at the U.N. again in October 2016 for the United Nations' International Day of the Girl Child, performing spoken word during the opening of the event; she also gave a speech during the proceedings.\n\nLewis contributed to \"Teen Vogue\" in 2016 and 2017, focusing on black women, intersectional feminism, and perceptions and approaches to handling violence in Chicago.

{"id": "21555729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21555729", "title": "Film", "text": "Film\n\nA film, also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, theatrical film, or photoplay, is a series of still images that, when shown on a screen, create the illusion of moving images. (See the glossary of motion picture terms.)\n\nThis optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed in rapid succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.\n\nThe word \"cinema\", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art of filmmaking itself. The contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences to communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.\n\nFilms were originally recorded onto plastic film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen. Contemporary films are now often fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected).\n\nFilms are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating‚Äîor indoctrinating‚Äîcitizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages.\n\nThe individual images that make up a film are called frames. In the projection of traditional celluloid films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called the phi phenomenon.\n\nThe name \"film\" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including \"picture\", \"picture show\", \"moving picture\", \"photoplay\", and \"flick\". The most common term in the United States is \"movie\", while in Europe \"film\" is preferred. Common terms for the field in general include \"the big screen\", \"the silver screen\", \"the movies\", and \"cinema\"; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In early years, the word \"sheet\" was sometimes used instead of \"screen\".\n\nPreceding film in origin by thousands of years, early plays and dances had elements common to film: scripts, sets, costumes, production, direction, actors, audiences, storyboards and scores. Much terminology later used in film theory and criticism apply, such as mise en sc√®ne (roughly, the entire visual picture at any one time). Owing to the lack of any technology for doing so, the moving images and sounds could not be recorded for replaying as with film.\n\nThe magic lantern, probably created by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s, could be used to project animation, which was achieved by various types of mechanical slides. Typically, two glass slides, one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that was to move, would be placed one on top of the other and projected together, then the moving slide would be hand-operated, either directly or by means of a lever or other mechanism. Chromotrope slides, which produced eye-dazzling displays of continuously cycling abstract geometrical patterns and colors, were operated by means of a small crank and pulley wheel that rotated a glass disc.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, inventions such as Joseph Plateau's phenakistoscope and the later zoetrope demonstrated that a carefully designed sequence of drawings, showing phases of the changing appearance of objects in motion, would appear to show the objects actually moving if they were displayed one after the other at a sufficiently rapid rate. These devices relied on the phenomenon of persistence of vision to make the display appear continuous even though the observer's view was actually blocked as each drawing rotated into the location where its predecessor had just been glimpsed. Each sequence was limited to a small number of drawings, usually twelve, so it could only show endlessly repeating cyclical motions. By the late 1880s, the last major device of this type, the praxinoscope, had been elaborated into a form that employed a long coiled band containing hundreds of images painted on glass and used the elements of a magic lantern to project them onto a screen.\n\nThe use of sequences of photographs in such devices was initially limited to a few experiments with subjects photographed in a series of poses because the available emulsions were not sensitive enough to allow the short exposures needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving. The sensitivity was gradually improved and in the late 1870s, Eadweard Muybridge created the first animated image sequences photographed in real-time. A row of cameras was used, each, in turn, capturing one image on a photographic glass plate, so the total number of images in each sequence was limited by the number of cameras, about two dozen at most. Muybridge used his system to analyze the movements of a wide variety of animal and human subjects. Hand-painted images based on the photographs were projected as moving images by means of his zoopraxiscope.\n\nBy the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of celluloid photographic film and the invention of motion picture cameras, which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact reel of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a \"peep show\" device such as the Kinetoscope and the mutoscope. Others were intended for a projector, mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these \"moving pictures\" could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was Blacksmith Scene, produced by Edison Manufacturing Company in 1893. The following year the company would begin Edison Studios, which became an early leader in the film industry with notable early shorts including The Kiss, and would go on to produce close to 1,200 films.\n\nThe first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American Woodville Latham and his sons, using films produced by their company, and by the ‚Äì arguably better known ‚Äì French brothers Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re with ten of their own productions. Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham's slightly predating the Lumi√®re brothers'. Another opinion is that the first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in America was at Brooklyn Institute in New York City 9 May 1893.\n\nThe earliest films were simply one static shot that showed an event or action with no editing or other cinematic techniques. Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several scenes together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until sound film became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely visual art, but these innovative silent films had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a pianist or organist or, in large urban theaters, a full orchestra to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete film scores were composed for major productions.\n\nThe rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, while the film industry in the United States flourished with the rise of Hollywood, typified most prominently by the innovative work of D. W. Griffith in The Birth of a Nation (1915) and Intolerance (1916). However, in the 1920s, European filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein, F. W. Murnau and Fritz Lang, in many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through Griffith, along with the contributions of Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton and others, quickly caught up with American film-making and continued to further advance the medium.\n\nIn the 1920s, the development of electronic sound recording technologies made it practical to incorporate a soundtrack of speech, music and sound effects synchronized with the action on the screen. The resulting sound films were initially distinguished from the usual silent \"moving pictures\" or \"movies\" by calling them \"talking pictures\" or \"talkies.\" The revolution they wrought was swift. By 1930, silent film was practically extinct in the US and already being referred to as \"the old medium.\"\n\nAnother major technological development was the introduction of \"natural color,\" which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring, stencil-coloring or other arbitrary procedures, although the earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from \"natural\" in appearance. While the advent of sound films quickly made silent films and theater musicians obsolete, color replaced black-and-white much more gradually. The pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three-strip version of the Technicolor process, first used for animated cartoons in 1932, then also for live-action short films and isolated sequences in a few feature films, then for an entire feature film, \"Becky Sharp\", in 1935. The expense of the process was daunting, but favorable public response in the form of increased box office receipts usually justified the added cost. The number of films made in color slowly increased year after year.\n\nIn the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North American theater attendance. In an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed, widescreen processes, polarized 3D projection, and stereophonic sound were introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule rather than the exception. Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s, but at first, they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color. During the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear. After the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid-decade, all Hollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with rare exceptions reluctantly made only at the insistence of \"star\" directors such as Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese.\n\nThe decades following the decline of the studio system in the 1960s saw changes in the production and style of film. Various New Wave movements (including the French New Wave, Indian New Wave, Japanese New Wave, and New Hollywood) and the rise of film-school-educated independent filmmakers contributed to the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th century. Digital technology has been the driving force for change throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. Digital 3D projection largely replaced earlier problem-prone 3D film systems and has become popular in the early 2010s.\n\n\"Film theory\" seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film as art. The concept of film as an art-form began with Ricciotto Canudo's \"The Birth of the Sixth Art\". Formalist film theory, led by Rudolf Arnheim, B√©la Bal√°zs, and Siegfried Kracauer, emphasized how film differed from reality and thus could be considered a valid fine art. Andr√© Bazin reacted against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its differences from reality, and this gave rise to realist theory. More recent analysis spurred by Jacques Lacan's psychoanalysis and Ferdinand de Saussure's semiotics among other things has given rise to psychoanalytic film theory, structuralist film theory, feminist film theory, and others. On the other hand, critics from the analytical philosophy tradition, influenced by Wittgenstein, try to clarify misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film's vocabulary and its link to a form of life.\n\nFilm is considered to have its own language. James Monaco wrote a classic text on film theory, titled \"How to \"Read\" a Film,\" that addresses this. Director Ingmar Bergman famously said, \"Andrei Tarkovsky for me is the greatest director, the one who invented a \"new language\", true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream.\" An example of the language is a sequence of back and forth images of one speaking actor's left profile, followed by another speaking actor's right profile, then a repetition of this, which is a language understood by the audience to indicate a conversation. This describes another theory of film, the 180-degree rule, as a visual story-telling device with an ability to place a viewer in a context of being psychologically present through the use of visual composition and editing. The \"Hollywood style\" includes this narrative theory, due to the overwhelming practice of the rule by movie studios based in Hollywood, California, during film's classical era. Another example of cinematic language is having a shot that zooms in on the forehead of an actor with an expression of silent reflection that cuts to a shot of a younger actor who vaguely resembles the first actor, indicating that the first person is remembering a past self, an edit of compositions that causes a time transition.\n\nMontage is the technique by which separate pieces of film are selected, edited, and then pieced together to make a new section of film. A scene could show a man going into battle, with flashbacks to his youth and to his home-life and with added special effects, placed into the film after filming is complete. As these were all filmed separately, and perhaps with different actors, the final version is called a montage. Directors developed a theory of montage, beginning with Eisenstein and the complex juxtaposition of images in his film \"Battleship Potemkin\". Incorporation of musical and visual counterpoint, and scene development through mise en scene, editing, and effects has led to more complex techniques comparable to those used in opera and ballet.\n\nFilm criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films. In general, these works can be divided into two categories: academic criticism by film scholars and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in newspapers and other media. Film critics working for newspapers, magazines, and broadcast media mainly review new releases. Normally they only see any given film once and have only a day or two to formulate their opinions. Despite this, critics have an important impact on the audience response and attendance at films, especially those of certain genres. Mass marketed action, horror, and comedy films tend not to be greatly affected by a critic's overall judgment of a film. The plot summary and description of a film and the assessment of the director's and screenwriters' work that makes up the majority of most film reviews can still have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film. For prestige films such as most dramas and art films, the influence of reviews is important. Poor reviews from leading critics at major papers and magazines will often reduce audience interest and attendance.\n\nThe impact of a reviewer on a given film's box office performance is a matter of debate. Some observers claim that movie marketing in the 2000s is so intense, well-coordinated and well financed that reviewers cannot prevent a poorly written or filmed blockbuster from attaining market success. However, the cataclysmic failure of some heavily promoted films which were harshly reviewed, as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent films indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence. Other observers note that positive film reviews have been shown to spark interest in little-known films. Conversely, there have been several films in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film. However, this usually backfires, as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a result. Journalist film critics are sometimes called film reviewers. Critics who take a more academic approach to films, through publishing in film journals and writing books about films using film theory or film studies approaches, study how film and filming techniques work, and what effect they have on people. Rather than having their reviews published in newspapers or appearing on television, their articles are published in scholarly journals or up-market magazines. They also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities as professors or instructors.\n\nThe making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented. Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was in their native France, the Lumi√®res quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses. In each country, they would normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export, import, and screen additional product commercially. The Oberammergau Passion Play of 1898 was the first commercial motion picture ever produced. Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world. Dedicated theaters and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion picture actors became major celebrities and commanded huge fees for their performances. By 1917 Charlie Chaplin had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars. From 1931 to 1956, film was also the only image storage and playback system for television programming until the introduction of videotape recorders.\n\nIn the United States, much of the film industry is centered around Hollywood, California. Other regional centers exist in many parts of the world, such as Mumbai-centered Bollywood, the Indian film industry's Hindi cinema which produces the largest number of films in the world. Though the expense involved in making films has led cinema production to concentrate under the auspices of movie studios, recent advances in affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions to flourish.\n\nProfit is a key force in the industry, due to the costly and risky nature of filmmaking; many films have large cost overruns, an example being Kevin Costner's \"Waterworld\". Yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting social significance. The Academy Awards (also known as \"the Oscars\") are the most prominent film awards in the United States, providing recognition each year to films, based on their artistic merits. There is also a large industry for educational and instructional films made in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts. Revenue in the industry is sometimes volatile due to the reliance on blockbuster films released in movie theaters. The rise of alternative home entertainment has raised questions about the future of the cinema industry, and Hollywood employment has become less reliable, particularly for medium and low-budget films.\n\nDerivative academic fields of study may both interact with and develop independently of filmmaking, as in film theory and analysis. Fields of academic study have been created that are derivative or dependent on the existence of film, such as film criticism, film history, divisions of film propaganda in authoritarian governments, or psychological on subliminal effects (e.g., of a flashing soda can during a screening). These fields may further create derivative fields, such as a movie review section in a newspaper or a television guide. Sub-industries can spin off from film, such as popcorn makers, and film-related toys (e.g., \"Star Wars\" figures). Sub-industries of pre-existing industries may deal specifically with film, such as product placement and other advertising within films.\n\nThe terminology used for describing motion pictures varies considerably between British and American English. In British usage, the name of the medium is \"film\". The word \"movie\" is understood but seldom used. Additionally, \"the pictures\" (plural) is used semi-frequently to refer to the place where movies are exhibited, while in American English this may be called \"the movies\", but it is becoming outdated. In other countries, the place where movies are exhibited may be called a cinema or movie theatre. By contrast, in the United States, \"movie\" is the predominant form. Although the words \"film\" and \"movie\" are sometimes used interchangeably, \"film\" is more often used when considering artistic, theoretical, or technical aspects. The term \"movies\" more often refers to entertainment or commercial aspects, as where to go for fun evening on a date. For example, a book titled \"How to Understand a Film\" would probably be about the aesthetics or theory of film, while a book entitled \"Let's Go to the Movies\" would probably be about the history of entertaining movies and blockbusters.\n\nFurther terminology is used to distinguish various forms and media used in the film industry. \"Motion pictures\" and \"moving pictures\" are frequently used terms for film and movie productions specifically intended for theatrical exhibition, such as, for instance, \"Batman\". \"DVD\" and \"videotape\" are video formats that can reproduce a photochemical film. A reproduction based on such is called a \"transfer.\" After the advent of theatrical film as an industry, the television industry began using videotape as a recording medium. For many decades, tape was solely an analog medium onto which moving images could be either recorded or transferred. \"Film\" and \"filming\" refer to the photochemical medium that chemically records a visual image and the act of recording respectively. However, the act of shooting images with other visual media, such as with a digital camera, is still called \"filming\" and the resulting works often called \"films\" as interchangeable to \"movies,\" despite not being shot on film. \"Silent films\" need not be utterly silent, but are films and movies without an audible dialogue, including those that have a musical accompaniment. The word, \"Talkies,\" refers to the earliest sound films created to have audible dialogue recorded for playback along with the film, regardless of a musical accompaniment. \"Cinema\" either broadly encompasses both films and movies, or it is roughly synonymous with film and theatrical exhibition, and both are capitalized when referring to a category of art. The \"silver screen\" refers to the projection screen used to exhibit films and, by extension, is also used as a metonym for the entire film industry.\n\n\"Widescreen\" refers to a larger width to height in the frame, compared to earlier historic aspect ratios. A \"feature-length film\", or \"feature film\", is of a conventional full length, usually 60 minutes or more, and can commercially stand by itself without other films in a ticketed screening. A \"short\" is a film that is not as long as a feature-length film, often screened with other shorts, or preceding a feature-length film. An \"independent\" is a film made outside the conventional film industry.\n\nIn US usage, one talks of a \"screening\" or \"projection\" of a movie or video on a screen at a public or private \"theater.\" In British English, a \"film showing\" happens at a cinema (never a \"theatre\", which is a different medium and place altogether). A cinema usually refers to an arena designed specifically to exhibit films, where the screen is affixed to a wall, while a theater usually refers to a place where live, non-recorded action or combination thereof occurs from a podium or other type of stage, including the amphitheater. Theaters can still screen movies in them, though the theater would be retrofitted to do so. One might propose \"going to the cinema\" when referring to the activity, or sometimes \"to the pictures\" in British English, whereas the US expression is usually \"going to the movies.\" A cinema usually shows a mass-marketed movie using a front-projection screen process with either a film projector or, more recently, with a digital projector. But, cinemas may also show theatrical movies from their home video transfers that include Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and videocassette when they possess sufficient projection quality or based upon need, such as movies that exist only in their transferred state, which may be due to the loss or deterioration of the film master and prints from which the movie originally existed. Due to the advent of digital film production and distribution, physical film might be absent entirely. A \"double feature\" is a screening of two independently marketed, stand-alone feature films. A \"viewing\" is a watching of a film. \"Sales\" and \"at the box office\" refer to tickets sold at a theater, or more currently, rights sold for individual showings. A \"release\" is the distribution and often simultaneous screening of a film. A \"preview\" is a screening in advance of the main release.\n\nAny film may also have a \"sequel\", which portrays events following those in the film. \"Bride of Frankenstein\" is an early example. When there are more films than one with the same characters, story arcs, or subject themes, these movies become a \"series,\" such as the James Bond series. And, existing outside a specific story timeline usually, does not exclude a film from being part of a series. A film that portrays events occurring earlier in a timeline with those in another film, but is released after that film, is sometimes called a \"prequel,\" an example being \"\".\n\nThe \"credits,\" or \"end credits,\" is a list that gives credit to the people involved in the production of a film. Films from before the 1970s usually start a film with credits, often ending with only a title card, saying \"The End\" or some equivalent, often an equivalent that depends on the language of the production. From then onward, a film's credits usually appear at the end of most films. However, films with credits that end a film often repeat some credits at or near the start of a film and therefore appear twice, such as that film's acting leads, while less frequently some appearing near or at the beginning only appear there, not at the end, which often happens to the director's credit. The credits appearing at or near the beginning of a film are usually called \"titles\" or \"beginning titles.\" A post-credits scene is a scene shown after the end of the credits. \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" has a post-credit scene in which Ferris tells the audience that the film is over and they should go home.\n\nA film's \"cast\" refers to a collection of the actors and actresses who appear, or \"star,\" in a film. A star is an actor or actress, often a popular one, and in many cases, a celebrity who plays a central character in a film. Occasionally the word can also be used to refer to the fame of other members of the crew, such as a director or other personality, such as Martin Scorsese. A \"crew\" is usually interpreted as the people involved in a film's physical construction outside cast participation, and it could include directors, film editors, photographers, grips, gaffers, set decorators, prop masters, and costume designers. A person can both be part of a film's cast and crew, such as Woody Allen, who directed and starred in \"Take the Money and Run\".\n\nA \"film goer,\" \"movie goer,\" or \"film buff\" is a person who likes or often attends films and movies, and any of these, though more often the latter, could also see oneself as a student to films and movies or the filmic process. Intense interest in films, film theory, and film criticism, is known as cinephilia. A film enthusiast is known as a cinephile or cineaste.\n\nA preview performance refers to a showing of a film to a select audience, usually for the purposes of corporate promotions, before the public film premiere itself. Previews are sometimes used to judge audience reaction, which if unexpectedly negative, may result in recutting or even refilming certain sections based on the audience response. One example of a film that was changed after a negative response from the test screening is 1982's \"First Blood\". After the test audience responded very negatively to the death of protagonist John Rambo, a Vietnam veteran, at the end of the film, the company wrote and re-shot a new ending in which the character survives.\n\nTrailers or previews are advertisements for films that will be shown in 1 to 3 months at a cinema. Back in the early days of cinema, with theaters that had only one or two screens, only certain trailers were shown for the films that were going to be shown there. Later, when theaters added more screens or new theaters were built with a lot of screens, all different trailers were shown even if they weren't going to play that film in that theater. Film studios realized that the more trailers that were shown (even if it wasn't going to be shown in that particular theater) the more patrons would go to a different theater to see the film when it came out. The term \"trailer\" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film program. That practice did not last long because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film (or the \"A film\" in a double feature program) begins. Film trailers are also common on DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Trailers are created to be engaging and interesting for viewers. As a result, in the Internet era, viewers often seek out trailers to watch them. Of the ten billion videos watched online annually in 2008, film trailers ranked third, after news and user-created videos. Teasers are a much shorter preview or advertisement that lasts only 10 to 30 seconds. Teasers are used to get patrons excited about a film coming out in the next six to twelve months. Teasers may be produced even before the film production is completed.\n\nFilm is used for a range of goals, including education and propaganda. When the purpose is primarily educational, a film is called an \"educational film\". Examples are recordings of academic lectures and experiments, or a film based on a classic novel. Film may be propaganda, in whole or in part, such as the films made by Leni Riefenstahl in Nazi Germany, US war film trailers during World War II, or artistic films made under Stalin by Eisenstein. They may also be works of political protest, as in the films of Andrzej Wajda, or more subtly, the films of Andrei Tarkovsky. The same film may be considered educational by some, and propaganda by others as the categorization of a film can be subjective.\n\nAt its core, the means to produce a film depend on the content the filmmaker wishes to show, and the apparatus for displaying it: the zoetrope merely requires a series of images on a strip of paper. Film production can, therefore, take as little as one person with a camera (or even without a camera, as in Stan Brakhage's 1963 film \"Mothlight\"), or thousands of actors, extras, and crew members for a live-action, feature-length epic.\n\nThe necessary steps for almost any film can be boiled down to conception, planning, execution, revision, and distribution. The more involved the production, the more significant each of the steps becomes. In a typical production cycle of a Hollywood-style film, these main stages are defined as development, pre-production, production, post-production and distribution.\n\nThis production cycle usually takes three years. The first year is taken up with \"development\". The second year comprises \"preproduction\" and \"production\". The third year, \"post-production\" and \"distribution\". The bigger the production, the more resources it takes, and the more important financing becomes; most feature films are artistic works from the creators' perspective (e.g., film director, cinematographer, screenwriter) and for-profit business entities for the production companies.\n\nA film crew is a group of people hired by a film company, employed during the \"production\" or \"photography\" phase, for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture. \"Crew\" is distinguished from \"cast\", who are the actors who appear in front of the camera or provide voices for characters in the film. The \"crew\" interacts with but is also distinct from the \"production staff\", consisting of producers, managers, company representatives, their assistants, and those whose primary responsibility falls in pre-production or post-production phases, such as screenwriters and film editors. Communication between \"production\" and \"crew\" generally passes through the director and his/her staff of assistants. Medium-to-large crews are generally divided into departments with well-defined hierarchies and standards for interaction and cooperation between the departments. Other than acting, the crew handles everything in the photography phase: props and costumes, shooting, sound, electrics (i.e., lights), sets, and production special effects. Caterers (known in the film industry as \"craft services\") are usually not considered part of the crew.\n\nFilm stock consists of transparent celluloid, acetate, or polyester base coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals. Cellulose nitrate was the first type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials. Stock widths and the film format for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as 35¬†mm prints.\nOriginally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked cameras and projectors; though 1000 frames per minute (16 frame/s) is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates most films were shot between 16 frame/s and 23 frame/s and projected from 18 frame/s on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown). When sound film was introduced in the late 1920s, a constant speed was required for the sound head. 24 frames per second were chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality. Improvements since the late 19th century include the mechanization of cameras¬†‚Äì allowing them to record at a consistent speed, quiet camera design¬†‚Äì allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large \"blimps\" to encase the camera, the invention of more sophisticated filmstocks and lenses, allowing directors to film in increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action. The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action pictures, many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously.\n\nAs a medium, film is not limited to motion pictures, since the technology developed as the basis for photography. It can be used to present a progressive sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow. Film has also been incorporated into multimedia presentations and often has importance as primary historical documentation. However, historic films have problems in terms of preservation and storage, and the motion picture industry is exploring many alternatives. Most films on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films. Some studios save color films through the use of separation masters: three B&W negatives each exposed through red, green, or blue filters (essentially a reverse of the Technicolor process). Digital methods have also been used to restore films, although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them (as of 2006) a poor choice for long-term preservation. Film preservation of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and archivists and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in order to make them available to future generations (and thereby increase revenue). Preservation is generally a higher concern for nitrate and single-strip color films, due to their high decay rates; black-and-white films on safety bases and color films preserved on Technicolor imbibition prints tend to keep up much better, assuming proper handling and storage.\n\nSome films in recent decades have been recorded using analog video technology similar to that used in television production. Modern digital video cameras and digital projectors are gaining ground as well. These approaches are preferred by some film-makers, especially because footage shot with digital cinema can be evaluated and edited with non-linear editing systems (NLE) without waiting for the film stock to be processed. The migration was gradual, and as of 2005, most major motion pictures were still shot on film.\n\nIndependent filmmaking often takes place outside Hollywood, or other major studio systems. An independent film (or indie film) is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a major film studio. Creative, business and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century. On the business side, the costs of big-budget studio films also lead to conservative choices in cast and crew. There is a trend in Hollywood towards co-financing (over two-thirds of the films put out by Warner Bros. in 2000 were joint ventures, up from 10% in 1987). A hopeful director is almost never given the opportunity to get a job on a big-budget studio film unless he or she has significant industry experience in film or television. Also, the studios rarely produce films with unknown actors, particularly in lead roles.\n\nBefore the advent of digital alternatives, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce, direct, or star in a traditional studio film. But the advent of consumer camcorders in 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of high-resolution digital video in the early 1990s, have lowered the technology barrier to film production significantly. Both production and post-production costs have been significantly lowered; in the 2000s, the hardware and software for post-production can be installed in a commodity-based personal computer. Technologies such as DVDs, FireWire connections and a wide variety of professional and consumer-grade video editing software make film-making relatively affordable.\n\nSince the introduction of digital video DV technology, the means of production have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot a film with a digital video camera and edit the film, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a high-end home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent filmmakers rely on film festivals to get their films noticed and sold for distribution. The arrival of internet-based video websites such as YouTube and Veoh has further changed the filmmaking landscape, enabling indie filmmakers to make their films available to the public.\n\nAn open content film is much like an independent film, but it is produced through open collaborations; its source material is available under a license which is permissive enough to allow other parties to create fan fiction or derivative works, than a traditional copyright. Like independent filmmaking, open source filmmaking takes place outside Hollywood, or other major studio systems.\n\nA fan film is a film or video inspired by a film, television program, comic book or a similar source, created by fans rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been amateurs, but some of the most notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to rarer full-length motion pictures.\n\nFilm distribution is the process through which a film is made available for viewing by an audience. This is normally the task of a professional film distributor, who would determine the marketing strategy of the film, the media by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing, and may set the release date and other matters. The film may be exhibited directly to the public either through a movie theater (historically the main way films were distributed) or television for personal home viewing (including on DVD-Video or Blu-ray Disc, video-on-demand, online downloading, television programs through broadcast syndication etc.). Other ways of distributing a film include rental or personal purchase of the film in a variety of media and formats, such as VHS tape or DVD, or Internet downloading of streaming using a computer.\n\nAnimation is a technique in which each frame of a film is produced individually, whether generated as a computer graphic, or by photographing a drawn image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see claymation and stop motion), and then photographing the result with a special animation camera. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second, there is an illusion of continuous movement (due to the phi phenomenon). Generating such a film is very labor-intensive and tedious, though the development of computer animation has greatly sped up the process. Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for TV and films comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of independent animation has existed at least since the 1950s, with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.\n\nLimited animation is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using \"short cuts\" in the animation process. This method was pioneered by UPA and popularized by Hanna-Barbera in the United States, and by Osamu Tezuka in Japan, and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from movie theaters to television. Although most animation studios are now using digital technologies in their productions, there is a specific style of animation that depends on film. Camera-less animation, made famous by film-makers like Norman McLaren, Len Lye, and Stan Brakhage, is painted and drawn directly onto pieces of film, and then run through a projector.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3831728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3831728", "title": "Groundshare", "text": "Groundshare\n\nGroundshare is the principle of sharing a stadium between two local sport teams. This is usually done for the purpose of reducing the costs of either construction of two separate facilities and related maintenance.\n\nGiven sufficient compatibility between facility requirements, two teams that do not play the same sport may share a ground or a stadium. North American indoor arenas commonly feature basketball and ice hockey teams sharing the facility during their common fall-to-spring season; a layer of insulation and a basketball floor can easily be laid over or removed from the hockey rink, and dasherboards disassembled or reconfigured, in a matter of hours. Historically baseball and American football teams often shared a large general-purpose outdoor or domed stadium, particularly during the multi-purpose stadium era of the 1960s-1990s, despite the dissimilarity of their fields. This practice fell out of fashion in the 1990s as baseball teams constructed highly specialized stadia in which football fields fit awkwardly if at all. Football teams in turn built more specifically rectangular stadia, often with a floor slightly wider than American football requirements to comfortably accommodate domestic or international soccer as American spectator interest in that sport grew.\n\nA variation on the groundshare concept exists commonly within the NBA and the NHL. As the requirements for a regulation NHL hockey rink and a regulation NBA basketball court do not differ significantly, in the majority of cases where a metropolitan area has both an NBA and an NHL franchise, the teams share the same arena.\n\nThis is two teams that play the same sport share the same ground. These may be two non-competing teams who play at different levels, such as Bury F.C., renting Gigg Lane to F.C. United of Manchester in England.\n\nThis is where two teams in the same league share the same ground, such as the New York Giants and New York Jets sharing MetLife Stadium.\n\nIn the American NBA, only two franchises share one arena: both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers share Staples Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24135873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24135873", "title": "Hip-hop theater", "text": "Hip-hop theater\n\nHip-hop theater is a form of theater that presents contemporary stories through the use of one or more of the four elements of hip-hop culture‚Äîb-boying, graffiti writing, MCing (rapping), and DJing. Other cultural markers of hip-hop such as spoken word, beatboxing, and hip-hop dance can be included as well although they are not always present. What is most important is the language of the theatrical piece and the plot's relevance to the world. Danny Hoch, founder of the Hip-Hop Theater Festival, further defines it as such: \"Hip-hop theatre must fit into the realm of theatrical performance, and it must be \"by, about and for\" the hip-hop generation, participants in hip-hop culture, or both.\"\n\nHip-hop theater productions appear in a wide range of platforms including single performances, week-long festivals, and traveling repertory companies. Marc Bamuthi Joseph is an award-winning spoken word poet and dancer who has been commissioned several times to create and direct single hip-hop theater works. British choreographer Jonzi D is the artistic director of the London-based Breakin' Convention, a week long hip-hop theater festival. Rennie Harris, Mourad Merzouki, and Victor Quijada are artistic directors who run hip-hop theater companies in the U.S., France, and Canada respectively. The Rock Steady Crew, Magnificent Force, and the Rhythm Technicians pioneered this theatrical genre which started in the United States.\n\nThough hip-hop culture has managed to establish itself on film, on television, in fashion, in music, and in the dance industry, it has not gained the same momentum in theater. Stage productions are few in number but growing. The first hip-hop stage shows were 1990's off Broadway musical \"So! What Happens Now?\" and 1995's \"Jam on the Groove\" which were co-authored, co-directed, and co-choreographed by Jorge \"Popmaster Fabel\" Pabon and Steffan \"Mr. Wiggles\" Clemente. Rock Steady Crew, Magnificent Force, and the Rhythm Technicians performed in both shows. Aside from the pioneers in New York City was Lorenzo \"Rennie\" Harris' Puremovement (RHPM) hip-hop theater company which Harris founded in 1992 in Philadelphia. The company has toured all over the world showcasing its original works such as \"March of the Antmen\", \"P-Funk\", \"Endangered Species\", \"Facing Mekka\", and \"Rome & Jewels\". RHPM also organizes the annual Illadelph Legends Festival which brings together the pioneers‚Äîthe people who were b-boying, locking, and popping in the 1970s when these styles were developed‚Äîand respected practitioners of hip-hop dance to teach master classes, give lecture demonstrations, and participate in panel discussions.\n\nOther hip-hop theater companies were founded in the 1990s. Compagnie K√§fig is a French hip-hop theater company of mostly Algerian descent founded in 1995 by Mourad Merzouki. Their performances mix standard b-boying, locking, and popping with capoeira, mime, and gymnastics. They use the same fusion in music by mixing rap music with classical music and Andalusian guitar. While on tour in the U.S. they performed at Jacob's Pillow in Massachusetts and at the Joyce Theater in New York. Bintou Demb√©l√© performed at the Joyce Theater in New York with Mourad Merzouki's Compagnie K√§fig in 2002. That same year she created her own dance company, which she describes as being mainly inspired by Pina Bausch's notion of 'danced theater'.\n\nThe Groovaloos are a hip-hop theater company based in Los Angeles that was founded by Bradley \"Shooz\" Rapier. They started out in 1999 as a dance crew and eventually developed a stage show called \"Groovaloo\" that is a series of stories based on the true life experiences of the dancers. Company members include Edmundo \"Poe One\" Loayza, Rynan \"Kid Rainen\" Paguio from JabbaWockeeZ, and Teresa \"Rag Doll\" Espinosa from Beat Freaks.\n\nRUBBERBANDance Group (RBDG) was founded in 2002 in Montreal by Los Angeles native Victor Quijada. Quijada first started dancing as a b-boy in Baldwin Park, California. He studied modern dance in high school and after graduating went on to become a professional dancer under Twyla Tharp and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montr√©al. He started RBDG after leaving the Montreal ballet. \"The New York Times\" called the style of dance his company performs \"post hip-hop\" because it's a fusion of hip-hop dance and ballet.\n\nMarc Bamuthi Joseph is an award-winning spoken word poet and playwright who frequently directs independent hip-hop theater productions. Some of his works include \"Word Becomes Flesh\", \"De/Cipher\", and \"No Man's Land\". He collaborated with Rennie Harris in 2007 to create \"Scourge\", a play about Haiti's social-economic struggles. Joseph directed the play while Harris served as the choreographer. In 2008, he created \"the break/s\" which is based on the book \"Can't Stop Won't Stop\" by Jeff Chang.\n\nOther solo hip-hop theater artists include Sarah Jones who headlined the first Hip-Hop Theater Festival and award-winning playwright Will \"Power\" Wylie who collaborated with Danny Hock on his one-man play \"Flow\". Also, West Coast feminist writer/performer Aya de Leon whose award-winning show \"Thieves in the Temple: The Reclaiming of Hip Hop\" focused on fighting sexism and consumerism in hip hop.\n\n\n\n"}

The series consists of a first season of 22 episodes which ran from March 19, 2009 until September 11, 2009, a second season of 20 episodes which premiered on January 28, 2010, as well as two derivative series that run concurrently with the second season, and concluded on June 4, 2010. The series is well received, and is the first non-variety sketch show on the site to make it past a first season. The show, like many on the site, takes fan submissions and integrated them into each episode.\n\nThe show is a parody of the fandom that surrounds popular vampire franchises like \"Twilight\".\n\nCorbin and Luci, two best friends, run \"I <3 Vampires\" - a fansite for their favorite book, \"Confessions of a High School Vampire\", for which Corbin makes daily vlogs regarding the book series. When Luci receives an anonymous e-mail containing the first six chapters of the upcoming book in the \"Confessions\" series (derived from the online leak of part of the fifth Twilight book, Midnight Sun), the best friends are so excited that Corbin posts the chapters on \"I <3 Vampires\" without thinking about the consequences. When the books' author, Siona McCabre, learns that chapters of her new book have been leaked, and announces that she has halted the publication of the book indefinitely, Corbin and Luci take it upon themselves to find Siona and apologize, hoping that Siona will continue with the book's publication. With the help of Corbin's annoying neighbour, Wyatt, the three go on a quest to find Siona, which proves to be more difficult - and much more complicated - than they had originally thought.\n\nA year ago, Corbin and Luci found out that their favorite book, \"Confessions of a High School Vampire\", was more real than they ever could have imagined. Now the two are no longer friends, and have abandoned \"I <3 Vampires,\" the fansite they created for \"Confessions\". They have also broken up with their supernatural boyfriends, Nick and Wyatt, and so Corbin is surprised when Siona McCabre, author of \"Confessions\" and mother to Corbin's ex-boyfriend Nick, asks Corbin to help her find Nick, who has been missing for several weeks. Corbin refuses. Three days later, Corbin learns that Siona has been killed, and so she makes her first vlog since abandoning \"I <3 Vampires,\" in which she apologizes for leaving the fansite without an explanation. Corbin then goes missing, and it's up to her college roommate, \"Confessions\" fan Sam, to reunite Luci and Wyatt so that the three of them can find Corbin together.\n\nAt the conclusion of the second season there was not any news on whether or not there would be a third season. Cherilyn Wilson and Alli Kinzel later stated in a YouTube video that there would not be another season coming in the foreseeable future as they have not been contacted about continuing the series, despite high fan demand. On June 15, Josh Nuncio announced on Twitter that both seasons with cast commentary and alternate endings would be available on Amazon.com.\n\nIn 2011 Disney Publishing Worldwide published \"I Heart Vampires: Birth (A Confessions of a High School Vampire Novel)\" which was written by Siona McCabre. It is the same book that Corbin and Luci read in the series. The book is about the student Noah Vance who discoveres two bite marks in a morning after a high school party. He realizes that he is turning into a vampire.\n\n\n\"Webby Awards:\"\n\n\"Streamy Award:\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48994", "title": "Limerick (poetry)", "text": "Limerick (poetry)\n\nA limerick is a form of verse, almost always humorous and sometimes rude, in five-line, predominantly meter with a strict rhyme scheme of AABBA, in which the first, second and fifth line rhyme, while the third and fourth lines are shorter and share a different rhyme. The following example is a limerick of unknown origin:\nThe form appeared in England in the early years of the 18th century. It was popularized by Edward Lear in the 19th century, although he did not use the term. Gershon Legman, who compiled the largest and most scholarly anthology, held that the true limerick as a folk form is always obscene, and cites similar opinions by Arnold Bennett and George Bernard Shaw, describing the clean limerick as a \"periodic fad and object of magazine contests, rarely rising above mediocrity\". From a folkloric point of view, the form is essentially transgressive; violation of taboo is part of its function. \n\nThe standard form of a limerick is a stanza of five lines, with the first, second and fifth rhyming with one another and having three feet of three syllables each; and the shorter third and fourth lines also rhyming with each other, but having only two feet of three syllables. The defining \"foot\" of a limerick's meter is usually the anapaest, (\"ta-ta-TUM\"), but catalexis (missing a weak syllable at the beginning of a line) and extra-syllable rhyme (which adds an extra unstressed syllable) can make limericks appear amphibrachic (\"ta-TUM-ta\").\n\nThe first line traditionally introduces a person and a place, with the place appearing at the end of the first line and establishing the rhyme scheme for the second and fifth lines. In early limericks, the last line was often essentially a repeat of the first line, although this is no longer customary.\n\nWithin the genre, ordinary speech stress is often distorted in the first line, and may be regarded as a feature of the form: \"There \"was\" a young \"man\" from the \"coast\";\" \"There \"once\" was a \"girl\" from De\"troit\"‚Ä¶\" Legman takes this as a convention whereby prosody is violated simultaneously with propriety. Exploitation of geographical names, especially exotic ones, is also common, and has been seen as invoking memories of geography lessons in order to subvert the decorum taught in the schoolroom; Legman finds that the exchange of limericks is almost exclusive to comparatively well-educated males, women figuring in limericks almost exclusively as \"villains or victims\". The most prized limericks incorporate a kind of twist, which may be revealed in the final line or lie in the way the rhymes are often intentionally tortured, or both. Many limericks show some form of internal rhyme, alliteration or assonance, or some element of word play. Verses in limerick form are sometimes combined with a refrain to form a limerick song, a traditional humorous drinking song often with obscene verses.\n\nDavid Abercrombie, a phonetician, takes a different view of the limerick, and one which seems to accord better with the form. It is this: Lines one, two, and five have three feet, that is to say three stressed syllables, while lines three and four have two stressed syllables. The number and placement of the unstressed syllables is rather flexible. There is at least one unstressed syllable between the stresses but there may be more ‚Äì as long as there are not so many as to make it impossible to keep the equal spacing of the stresses.\n\nThe origin of the name \"limerick\" for this type of poem is debated. The name is generally taken to be a reference to the City or County of Limerick in Ireland sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\"\n\nUntil recently, the first known usage in England was from 1898 (\"New English Dictionary\") and in the United States from 1902, but in recent years several earlier examples have been documented, the earliest being an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune,\nThe limerick form was popularized by Edward Lear in his first \"Book of Nonsense\" (1846) and a later work, \"More Nonsense, Pictures, Rhymes, Botany, etc\". (1872). Lear wrote 212 limericks, mostly considered nonsense literature. It was customary at the time for limericks to accompany an absurd illustration of the same subject, and for the final line of the limerick to be a variant of the first line ending in the same word, but with slight differences that create a nonsensical, circular effect. The humour is not in the \"punch line\" ending but rather in the tension between meaning and its lack.\n\nThe following is an example of one of Edward Lear's limericks.\nLear's limericks were often typeset in three or four lines, according to the space available under the accompanying picture.\n\nThe limerick form is so well known that it has been parodied in many ways. The following example is of unknown origin:\nOther parodies deliberately break the rhyme scheme, like the following example, attributed to W.S. Gilbert:\nComedian John Clarke has also parodied Lear's style:\nThe British wordplay and recreational mathematics expert Leigh Mercer (1893‚Äì1977) devised the following mathematical limerick:\nThis is read as follows:\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nLimerick bibliographies:\n"}

{"id": "16716141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16716141", "title": "Long poem", "text": "Long poem\n\nThe long poem is a literary genre including all poetry of considerable length. Though the definition of a long poem is vague and broad, the genre includes some of the most important poetry ever written.\n\nWith more than 220000 (100000 shloka or couplets) verses and about 1.8 million words in total, the \"MahƒÅbhƒÅrata\" is the longest epic poem in the world. It is roughly ten times the size of the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" combined, roughly five times longer than Dante's \"Divine Comedy\", and about four times the size of the \"Ramayana\" and Ferdowsi's \"Shahnameh\". \n\nIn English, \"Beowulf\" and Chaucer's \"Troilus and Criseyde\" are among the first important long poems. The long poem thrived and gained new vitality in the hands of experimental Modernists in the early 1900s and has continued to evolve through the 21st century.\n\nThe long poem has evolved into an umbrella term, encompassing many subgenres, including epic, verse novel, verse narrative, lyric sequence, lyric series, and collage/montage. \n\nLynn Keller describes the long poem as being a poem that is simply \"book length,\" but perhaps the simplest way to define \"long poem\" is this: a long poem is long enough that its bulk carries meaning. Susan Stanford Friedman describes the long poem as a genre in which all poems that are not considered to be short can be a considered a part. These overly inclusive definitions, though problematic, serve the breadth of the long poem, and have fueled its adaptation as a voice for cultural identity among marginalized persons in Modern and Contemporary poetry. Only a broad definition can apply to the genre as a whole. In general, a poem is a \"long poem\" when its length enhances and expands upon the thematic, creative, and formal weight of the poem.\n\nThough the term \"long poem\" may be elusive to define, the term is now finally getting the attention it deserves. The genre has gained importance both as a literary form, and as a means of collective expression. Lynn Keller solidifies the genre's importance in her essay, \"Pushing the Limits,\" by stating that the long poem will always be recognized as a notable genre of importance in early twentieth-century American literature.\n\nA long poem often functions to tell a \"tale of the tribe,\" or a story that encompasses a whole culture's values and history. Ezra Pound coined the phrase, referring to his own long poem \"The Cantos.\" The long poem's length and scope can contain concerns of a magnitude that a shorter poem cannot address. The poet may see himself or herself as the \"bearer of the light,\" to use Langston Hughes' term, who leads the journey through a culture's story, or as the one who makes known the light already within the tribe. The poet may also serve as a poet-prophet with special insight for their own tribe.\n\nIn Modern and Contemporary long poems the \"tale of the tribe\" has frequently been retold by culturally, economically, and socially marginalized persons. Thus, pseudo-epic narratives, such as Derek Walcott's \"Omeros,\" have emerged to occupy voids where post colonial persons, racially oppressed persons, women, and other people who have been ignored by classic epics, and denied a voice in the prestigious genre.\n\nVarious poets have undertaken a \"revisionary mythopoesis\" in the long poem genre. Since the genre has roots in forms that traditionally exclude poets who have minimal cultural authority, the long poem can be a \"fundamental re-vision,\" and function as a discourse for those poets (Friedman). These \"re-visions\" may include neglected characters, deflation of traditionally celebrated characters, and a general reworking of standards set by the literary tradition. This revision is noted especially by feminist critical work that analyzes how women are given a new voice and story through the transformation of a previously \"masculine\" form.\n\nLynn Keller notes that the long poem enabled modernists to include sociological, anthropological, and historical material. Many long poems deal with history not in the revisionary sense but as a simple re-telling in order to prove a point. Then there are those who go a step further and recite a place's or people's history in order to teach. Like revisionary mythopoesis, they may attempt to make a point or demonstrate a new perspective by exaggerating or editing certain parts of a history.\n\nLong poem authors sometimes find great difficulty in making the entire poem coherent and/or deciding on a way to end it or wrap it up. Fear of failure is also a common concern, that perhaps the poem will not have as great an impact as intended. Since many long poems take the author's lifetime to complete, this concern is especially troubling to anyone who attempts the long poem. Ezra Pound is an example of this dilemma, with his poem \"The Cantos\". As the long poem's roots lie in the epic, authors of the long poem often feel an intense pressure to make their long poems the defining literature of the national identity or the shared identity of a large group of people. The American long poem is under pressure from its European predecessors, revealing a special variety of this anxiety. Walt Whitman tried to achieve this idea of characterizing the American identity in \"Song of Myself\". Thus, when the author feels that their work fails to reach such a caliber or catalyze a change within the intended audience, they might consider the poem a failure as a whole.\n\nPoets attempting to write a long poem often struggle to find the right form or combination of forms to use. Since the long poem itself cannot be strictly defined by one certain form, a challenge lies in choosing the most effective form.\n\nInclusivity\n\nThe long poem has been considered a problematic genre for women writers. Its roots in epic make the genre appear to be non-inclusive of female writers. This is due to the epic's long history of being primarily a realm of writing for men.\n\nLyric intensity\n\nSome critics, most emphatically Edgar Allan Poe, consider poetry as a whole to be more closely tied to the lyric. They complain that the emotional intensity involved within a lyric is impossible to maintain in the length of the long poem, thus rendering the long poem impossible or inherently a failure.\n\nIn his article \"The long poem: sequence or consequence?\" Ted Weiss quotes a passage from M. L. Rozenthal and Sally M. Gall's \"The Modern Poetic Sequence\" inspired by Poe's sentiments, \"What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely a succession of brief ones... It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such, only inasmuch as it intensely excites, by elevating, the soul; and all intense excitements are, through a psychal-necessity, brief. For this reason, at least one half of the Paradise Lost is essentially prose‚Äîa succession of poetical excitements interspersed, inevitably,with corresponding depressions‚Äîthe whole being deprived, through the extremities of its length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity, of effect. In short, a poem to be truly a poem should not exceed a half hour's reading. In any case, no unified long poem is possible.\"\n\nMultivocality\n\nOne genre theory claims that once a poem takes on multiple voices, it becomes a novel. Many long poems do make use of multiple voices, while still maintaining all the element of a poem, and therefore cause even more confusion when trying to define their genre.\n\nNaming and subgenres\n\nCritic Lynn Keller also expresses concerns about the genre in her essay \"Pushing the Limits.\" Keller states that because of the debate over and prevalence of subgenres and forms within the overarching genre of long poem, critics and readers tend to choose one subgenre, typically the epic form, as being the \"authentic\" representative form of the genre. Therefore, this causes the other equally important subgenres to be subject to criticism for not adhering to the more \"authentic\" form of long poem. Other critics of the long poem sometimes hold the belief that with long poems, there is no \"middle ground.\" They view long poems as ultimately being either epics or lyrics.\n\nMany critics refer to the long poem by various adjective-filled subgenre names that often are made of various components found within the poem. These can lead to confusion about what a long poem is exactly. Below you will find a list describing the most common (and agreed upon) subgenre categories.\n\nThe long poem genre has several advantages over prose and strictly lyric poetry. The most obvious difference between the long poem and other literary genres is the sheer difficulty of composing a long work entirely in verse. Poets who undertake the long poem face the serious problem of creating a work that is consistently poetic, sometimes taking strict forms and carrying them through the whole poem. However, the poets who do choose the long poem turn this liability into an advantage‚Äîif a poet can write a long poem, they prove themselves to be worthy. The very difficulty gives the genre an implicit prestige. Long poems have been among the most influential texts in the world since Homer. By writing a long poem, a poet participates in this tradition and must prove their virtuosity by living up to the tradition. As discussed below, the traditionally difficult long poem's prestige can be revised to serve radical purposes.\n\nAdditional benefits of the long poem:\n\n\nCritic Lynn Keller voices the concerns of female poets writing within the genre of the long poem. In her essay \"Pushing the Limits\", she discusses the long poem in regards to its female contributors, a group often forgotten or marginalized in favor of the more privileged white male author. Not only does Keller discuss women and their place in the authorship of the long poem, but she also talks about the tendency of the genre to forget authors who are not white and male, therefore leaving out minority writers, foreign writers, and writers of different sexual orientation.\n\nKeller explains the long poem as being a \"generic hybrid\". By this, Keller means that the form, in large part because of its indefinable nature, gives authors creative leeway to mold and form the genre of long poem to fit their creative needs. The long poem's flexibility should not only be open to include women and minority writers, but should be a haven in which these writers can use their writing to voice their identity, a primary topic for the long poem genre.\n\nAs stated above in \"Concerns and Controversies\", many female writers have felt that they have no place within the long poem genre because of its epic roots. The epic is a historically masculine genre and has not welcomed female writers or other authors who are not male and white. The long poem is often understood as the epic reborn, making it seem like a genre inaccessible to women. Women who did participate within the long poem and epic forms were often highly criticized or overlooked until recently, as there has been increasing interest in such authors as H.D.\n\nKeller also discusses a primary critic of the long poem, Kamboureli, in her essay. Kamboureli's stance is that long poem's readers and contributors should not preference one form of long poem over another. To extend this idea, it is also equally important to say that one type of author within this genre should not be privileged over another. The textual \"betweeness\", an idea coined by Kamboureli and discussed in Keller's essay, provides a place where writers can create their art in a genre that is by its nature less restrictive than other poetic forms. This lack of restriction should be the very reason that the genre should be open to all. Its hybridisms and variety will only be enhanced by the presence of women and other writers.\n\nKeller states that this new perspective on long poem and reexamination of forgotten long poems has revived the form as a realm of possibilities for upcoming female writers. Female writers are seeing the long poem as a genre that should not only be open and inclusive to them, but also as a genre that theoretically could benefit the female writer as much if not more than the male writers the form previously favored. Women writers are now able to combat the \"dominant traditions\" at play within the long poem genre to mold the genre into their own, creating what critic Susan Friedman terms a \"re-vision\" of the form.\n\nElizabeth Barrett Browning was one of the first female authors to attempt an epic poem. In her article \"Written in blood: the art of mothering epic in the poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning\", Olivia Gatti Taylor explores Browning's attempt to write an authentically feminine epic poem titled \"Aurora Leigh\". Taylor posits that Browning began this process with the structure of her poem, \"While earlier epics like the \"Aeneid\" and \"Paradise Lost\" have twelve books, Aurora Leigh was conceived as a nine-book epic; thus, the very structure of the work reveals its gestational nature. According to Sandra Donaldson, Barrett Browning's own experience at age forty-three of \"giving birth and nurturing a child\" greatly influenced her poetry \"for the better\", deepening her \"sensitivity\".\n\nThe most important \"parent genre\" to the long poem is the epic. As stated on the page of the main article on the epic, \"An epic is a lengthy, revered narrative poem, ordinarily concerning a serious subject containing details of heroic deeds and events significant to a culture or nation.\" The term \"long poem\" includes all the generic expectations of epic and the reactions against those expectations. Many long poem subgenres share characteristics with the epic, including: telling the tale of a tribe or a nation, quests, history (either recitation or re-telling in order to learn from the past), a hero figure, or prophecies.\n\nOther subgenres of the long poem include lyric sequence, series, collage, and verse-novel. What unites each of these subgenres under the heading of long poem is that their length has importance in their meaning. Each subgenre, however, is unique in its style, manner of composition, voice, narration, and proximity to outside genres.\n\nSequence poetry uses the chronological linking of poems to construct meaning, as each lyric builds on the poems previous to it. Examples include Louise Gl√ºck's \"The Wild Iris\", and older sonnet cycles, such as Sir Philip Sidney's \"Astrophel and Stella\" or Dante's \"Vita Nuova\". Serial lyrics similarly depend on the juxtaposition and dialogue between individual lyrics to build a greater depth of meaning. Narrative poems rely heavily on\n\nOften, these subgenres are blended, blurred or overlapped to create second-generation subgenres. The blurring between the lines of the subgenres is what makes the long poem so hard to define, but it also marks the growing creativity in the use of the form.\n\nCritic Joseph Conte describes the epic as a long poem that \"has to have grand voice and purpose. . . it has to say something big.\" Lynn Keller describes one of the epic's aspects as including a \"quasi-circular quest-journey structure\" that she says is present in the long poem \"Song of Myself\" by Whitman. Yet that long poem, Keller notes, does not have a \"specified end toward which the poem or speaker is directed,\" unlike a more traditional long poem. Though long poems do have roots in the epic form, that does not mean long poems that are epic-like are completely epic. A second example of long poems distancing themselves from the traditional epic form is seen in \"Helen In Egypt\" by H.D. Though traditional epics feature physical quests or journeys, \"Helen In Egypt\" is about the psychological journey of Helen.\n\nOther characteristics of the epic include a hero figure, myths, and quests for the characters. Many such characteristics are seen in various long poems, but with some changes. For example, \"Helen In Egypt\" brings mythic revision, or revisionary mythopoesis, into play. Even though it includes the myth from the epic, the revised telling of the myth makes the long poem stand out as its own form. Additionally, one cannot look at the epic as a single, unified form of inspiration for long poems. As Keller points out, certain long poems can have roots in very specific epics instead of the overall epic category.\n\nThe long poem \"Omeros\" by Derek Walcott has drawn mixed criticism on whether it should or should not be tied to the traditional epic form. Those against that idea say that the poem's story is not as important as those found in traditional epics. \"Omeros\" tells the tale of fishermen in the Caribbean fighting over and lusting after a waitress instead of a typically heroic tale of battles and quests. On the other side of the argument lies the point that it is important to keep in mind that \"Omeros\" has ties to the epic genre, if only as a contrast. By putting more simple characters in the forefront as opposed to warriors, Walcott revises the traditional epic form, which these critics say is something to notice as opposed to cutting off \"Omeros\" from any ties to the epic whatsoever. Furthermore, these critics say that one cannot ignore the epic influence on the poem since its characters' names are taken from Homer. In \"Omeros\" there are distinct elements obviously influenced by traditional epics, such as a trip to the underworld, talk of a muse, etc.\n\nIn interviews, Walcott has both affirmed and denied that \"Omeros\" is tied to the epic form. In one interview he stated that it was a type of epic poem, but in another interview he said the opposite, stating as part of his evidence that there are no epic-like battles in his poem. In \"Omeros\" Walcott implies that he has never read Homer, which is probably untrue based on the character names derived from Homer. Walcott's denial of his poem being tied too heavily to the epic form may stem from his concern that people might only think of it as being an epic-influenced poem instead of transcending the epic genre.\n\nBased on this criticism of \"Omeros\" it is clear that the generic identity of a long poem greatly contributes to its meaning. Because long poems are influenced by many more strictly defined genres, a long poem revising strict generic rules creates striking contrast with epic-genre expectations.\n\nKeller also notes that she agrees with critic Susan Friedman when Friedman expresses her concern that the long poem associated with the epic has been \"the quintessential male territory whose boundaries enforce women's status as outsiders on the landscape of poetry.\" Considering that there are many long poem authors that are women, one cannot fully associate the long poem with the epic genre.\n\nHowever, the typical exclusion of women in the epic tradition is for many female authors what makes the long poem an appealing form for laying cultural claim to the epic.\n\nControl of or at least inclusion in the creation of a cultural epic is important because the traditional epic poem like \"The Odyssey\" or Virgil‚Äôs \"Aeneid\" is, at its core, a written history. Written history defines the good and the bad of a culture, the winners and losers, and the author of that history controls the very future by manipulating the knowledge of later generations. For Friedman to deny epic associations to the long poem because they are sometimes written by women is to counter the efforts of many female long poets.\n\nIf the long poem is considered an epic or invokes an epic in its length as many critics and readers aver then breaching its traditional exclusivity by using the epic to tell the story of marginalized peoples such as women rather than the victors is essentially an opportunity for the poet to rewrite history. Walcott‚Äôs \"Omeros\" is an excellent example of a long poem recording the untold history of a marginalized people.\n\nLikewise H.D.‚Äôs revision of the story of Helen of Troy in \"Helen\" is an attempt to exonerate women from the blame of the Trojan War. In this sense, form inexorably serves the function and meaning of the poem by indicating to the reader that the poem is, if not an epic, epic-like and therefore a history. For some female authors using the well known form of an epic is a way to legitimize their stories, but by slightly altering the epic tradition they also indicate that the traditional way is unacceptable and insufficient for their purposes. Embodying the modernist dilemma, the long poem as epic often contains the seeming belief in the futility of tradition and history paired with the obvious dependence on them.\n\nA lyric sequence is a collection of shorter lyric poems that interact to create a coherent, larger meaning. The lyric sequence often includes poems unified by a theme. A defining characteristic of this subgenre is that each lyric enhances the meaning of the other lyrics in the work, creating an enhanced collective metaphor, that opens the lyric sequence to unique adaptations of dialogue and other narrative/theatrical characteristics.\nCritic Lynn Keller lends some insight to the lyric sequence by placing it in opposition to the epic: ‚ÄúAt the opposite end of the critical spectrum are the treatments of the long poem that do not consider issues of quest, hero, community, nation, history and the like, and instead regard the form as essentially lyric.\n\nThe lyric series is a genre of poetry in which the seriality of short (but connective) lyric poems enhances the long poem's meaning. Seriality may contribute narrative coherence or thematic development, and it is often read in terms of the poem's productive process, i.e. how the poem \"produces its own experience\"(Shoptaw). Each lyric poem is distinct and has meaning in itself, yet it functions as an integral part of the series, giving it a greater meaning as within the long poem as well.\n\nDeborah Sinnreich-Levi and Ian Laurie examine the work of Oton de Grandson in the lyric series, or \"ballad series\" form. Grandson wrote several sets of short love lyrics, using the series form for narrative coherence and thematic construction, as well as to examine different aspects of a single narrative. George Oppen's \"Discrete Series\" relates its poetic seriality to the mathematic concept of a discrete series. Langston Hughes' \"Montage of a Dream Deferred\" qualifies as a serial lyric as well as a montage.\n\nThe best-known and most highly regarded example of a collage long poem is T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\". Critic Philip Cohen describes Eliot's use of the collage in his article \"The Waste Land, 1921: Some Developments of the Manuscript's Verse\":\n\n\"Eliot gradually created a more modernist poem, one which resembles a cubist collage: satiric narratives were abandoned in favor of first of dramatic poetry and then of a bold amalgamation of genres. The speakers shifted from omniscient narrators to a variety of separate-person voices and then to different voices of one shadowy character.\"\n\nThe collage combines seemingly disparate parts or \"fragments\" of different voices, pieces of mythology, popular song, speeches, and other utterances in an attempt to create a somewhat cohesive whole.\n\nThe best known Bengali long poem is JAKHAM (The Wound) written by Malay Roy Choudhury of India during the famous Hungryalist movement in 1960s.\n\nA montage is similar to a collage in that it consists of many voices, most famously portrayed in Langston Hughes' \"Montage of a Dream Deferred\". The poet provides a comprehensive portrait of 20th century Harlem through the use of numerous different voices and thus creates a cohesive whole through this fragmentary lens.\n\nWhat is perhaps the most debatable characteristic of this collage/montage form is the question of what is added to the message or content of the poem by using a more fragmented view. This debate is clearly visible within Langston Hughes' \"Montage\" in the question of who the primary voice belongs to and what is added by having Harlem shown through multiple people, as opposed to Hughes simply speaking from his own understanding of what makes Harlem.\n\nA verse narrative, as one might expect, is simply a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. What is interesting about this subgenre is that owing to its place in the flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to \"Gilgamesh\", which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.\n\nAs one of the main subgenres, Verse-Narrative gets the least attention because it so effortlessly overlaps the other subgenres. It does not necessarily have the components of an Epic, nor the lyricism and shifting scope of a Lyric Sequence or a Lyric Series, nor the close relation to narrative of Verse Novel. It exists for critics generally as an accepted part of the long poem Tradition.\n\nThe Greek poet Vasileios Vasileiadis(1958-) with his two long poems <Blind to see the Darkness> and <Point Zero> is an example for the Verse-Narrative long poetry.\n\nThe critic Lilach Lachman describes the Romantic long poem as one that, \"questioned the coherence of the conventional epic's plot, its logic of time and space, and its laws of interconnecting the narrative through action.\" Examples of the Romantic long poem is Keats' long poem Hyperion: A Fragment (1820), William Wordsworth's Recluse (Including the Prelude (1850), and The Excursion), and Percy Bysshe Shelley's Prometheus Unbound.\n\nThe Romance long poem contains many of the same components of the Romance Lyric. Michael O'Neil suggests that \"much romantic poetry is torn out of its own despair\" and, in fact, can exist as the tremulous fusion between \"self-trust and self-doubt.\"\n\nMeditations are reflective thought poems. Like the Montage and the Series subgenres, Meditations can be somewhat fragmented, yet their connectivity is what makes the long poem a coherent and cohesive idea. This subgenre is based on meditations (or thoughts). Wallace Stevens believes, as do other writers in this genre, that the work does not rely on the use of multiple voices.\n\nIn her essay \"The Twentieth Century Long Poem,\" Lynn Keller states that a more philosophical influence on these meditative long poems deals with relating imagination to reality, specifically in long poems by Wallace Stevens. Keller notes, \"Uninterested in American landscape, American history, modern mechanical triumphs, or the urban scene, his process-oriented long poems are speculative philosophical works exploring the relation of imagination to reality and the imagination's role in compensating for the loss of religious belief.\"\n\nW. H. Auden's \"New Year Letter\" is an example of a long-form meditative poem.\n\n\n"}

It premiered on December 3, 2008 on the Travel Channel. The program was originally hosted by actor and food enthusiast Adam Richman. In each episode, Richman explores the \"big food\" offerings of a different American city before facing off against a pre-existing eating challenge at a local restaurant. The program airs in syndication at various times during the week.\n\nTravel Channel announced in May 2017 that the series would be revived, with actor, food lover, and restaurant business veteran Casey Webb replacing Richman as host. The fifth season premiered on August 7, 2017. Casey Webb's second season on \"Man v. Food\" has been renewed with new episodes beginning later this year.\n\nSeries host Adam Richman grew up in Brooklyn, New York, completed his undergraduate degree in International Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and earned a master's degree from the Yale School of Drama. A self-educated food \"fanatic\", since 1995 he has kept a travel journal including each of the restaurants he visited and what he learned from the trip. Although described as \"a bit on the husky side\", to maintain his health while indulging for the show, Richman exercises twice a day while he's on the road. When the schedule permits, he does not eat the day before a challenge and he tries to stay \"crazy hydrated\" by drinking lots of water or club soda and foregoing coffee or soft drinks. After taping for a challenge is complete, Richman spends an hour or so on a treadmill, telling the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\", \"Being sedentary is incredibly uncomfortable. Despite the fact that the first 10 minutes or 15 minutes on the treadmill might suck, it actually does alleviate a lot of pressure, and you feel better.\"\n\nIn \"Man v. Food\", Adam Richman travels across the United States to explore the culture and unique \"big food\" of one city in each episode. In some episodes, Richman takes on food challenges involving very hot and spicy (or piquant) foods (such as foods spiced with habanero peppers), and also large quantities of food, such as a 5-pound-sandwich challenge. He finds places in each city to indulge his appetite and visits local landmarks. Richman interacts with local restaurateurs as they demonstrate the making of a house specialty or element of local cuisine. He gives a brief insight to the local community by talking to patrons at the establishments and asking about the most-talked about orders. The show emphasizes quality as well as quantity‚Äîa number of the locations in season one are Zagat-rated, while others have received honors from \"Esquire\" magazine as home of \"The Best Sandwiches in America\". Over the course of the series, his personal record was 37‚Äì22 (win-loss) in his food challenges. Combined with the team events in season four, the overall record stands at 48 wins for \"Man\" and 38 wins for \"Food\".\n\nEpisodes sometimes include a brief fantasy sequence where Richman pretends to be a character to psych himself up for the episode's big food challenge. The half-hour show culminates in Richman facing off against an established local food challenge. Each show wraps with a fake press conference where Richman fields questions about the challenge as if it were a just-concluded sporting event or as if he had just won, or in some cases lost, a big award.\n\nRichman made one attempt at a Guinness World Record when he and a group of 40 regional eaters attempted a 190¬†pound burger in two hours, in which case food won the battle with about 30¬†pounds left of the burger.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" noted that the Travel Channel received its highest-ever ratings for a new debut with \"Man v. Food\". They highlighted the show as an example of other networks moving in on the traditional turf of the Food Network.\n\nIn the \"Star-Ledger\", television critic Alan Sepinwall wrote, \"It ain't deep, and it certainly ain't healthy (I could feel my arteries clog just from watching), but it's fun.\"\n\nFeatures reporters Thomas Rozwadowski of the \"Green Bay Press-Gazette\" said that \"playfully eager host Adam Richman has won me over\" and that \"it's all in good fun.\"\n\n\"CityPages Minneapolis/St. Paul\" describes the show, \"...like the food version of \"Jackass\", with host Adam Richman as its very own Steve-O.\"\n\nChristopher Lawrence of the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\" describes Richman as \"impressive\" and \"likable\" saying \"think a beefier Fred Savage, although one who somehow weighs less than he did last season.\"\n\nJonathan Bernstein of British newspaper \"The Guardian\" described \"mixed feelings\" about the series saying he likes \"the concept\" and \"the guy\" but that the challenges make him \"a little uneasy\".\n\nCharlie Brooker, also of \"The Guardian\", was largely critical of the show's celebration of excess, stating \"if food is the new porn, this is an all-out orgy between wobbling gutsos and farmyard animals¬†‚Äì a snuff orgy, no less, since the latter end up sawn in half and smothered in BBQ sauce.\"\n\nAlton Brown, host of the food science show \"Good Eats\", was also critical of the show, calling \"Man v. Food\" \"disgusting,\" stating: \"That show is about gluttony, and gluttony is wrong. It's wasteful. Think about people that are starving to death and think about that show. I think it's an embarrassment.\"\n\nThe weekly series premiered on December 3, 2008, with back to back new episodes airing for the first two weeks then settling down to a pattern of one new episode followed by one repeat episode. First-run episodes of the series aired in the United States on the Travel Channel on Wednesdays at 10:00¬†pm Eastern time. The first season of \"Man v. Food\" was initially picked up for 10 episodes and then, after initial ratings success, an additional 8 episodes were ordered. The show travelled to Amarillo, Memphis, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Austin, Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, New York City, New Orleans, Portland, Seattle, Los Angeles, St. Louis, San Jose, Denver, the North Carolina Triangle, and Minneapolis. Over the course of the first season, the final record wound up at 11 wins for \"Man\" and 7 wins for \"Food\". Season 1 was released on DVD in the United States on October 6, 2009.\n\nThe second season of \"Man v. Food\" premiered on August 5, 2009, at 10:00¬†pm EDT. First-run episodes of the series aired in the United States on the Travel Channel on Wednesdays at 10:00¬†pm Eastern time. The 20 scheduled episodes included visits to San Antonio; Las Vegas; Charleston, South Carolina; San Francisco; Durham (North Carolina); Honolulu; Sarasota; Philadelphia; Springfield, Illinois; Boise; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Detroit; Brooklyn; Anchorage; Little Rock; Tucson; New Brunswick and Hartford, plus a \"Baseball Special\" episode that aired on September 30, 2009. After the season finale in Hartford, a special \"Live\" episode aired in Miami on February 3, 2010.\n\nNot counting the \"Live\" episode (which Adam won), the final second season tally stood at 13 wins for \"Man\" and 7 wins for \"Food\". The season 2 DVD was released on October 26, 2010.\n\nOn June 16, 2010, Season 3 began airing with a one-hour run at 9¬†pm ET before the premiere of \"Bert the Conqueror.\" It was announced on April 1, 2010, via Adam Richman on his personal Twitter account, that season 3 of Man v. Food would begin airing June 16 at 9¬†pm Eastern¬†/ 6¬†pm Pacific, with episodes in San Diego and Boulder. Other visits chronicled this season include Cleveland, Richmond, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Puerto Rico, Long Island, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Indianapolis, the Jersey Shore, Syracuse, Portland (Maine), Niagara Falls, Butte, Sacramento, Des Moines, Knoxville, and Ann Arbor.\n\nThe final tally for the third season was 12 wins for \"Man\" and 8 wins for \"Food\". At this point, Richman's total win percentage for the first three seasons is 62%.\n\nThe fourth season of \"Man v. Food\" is titled Man v. Food Nation. The format of the show is generally the same, with Richman travelling across the US to visit cities known for their interesting eateries. Unlike the previous seasons of \"Man v. Food\", Richman would recruit locals of the selected cities to take on the food challenges, while he serves as their coach. Richman stated that the change is not due to any lack of ability or desire to do the challenges himself, but instead to keep the show interesting. The locales featured on \"Man v. Food Nation\" were New Haven, Tampa, Nashville, Tulsa, Alburquerque, Mobile, the Florida Keys, the Gulf Coast, Portsmouth, Louisville, Milwaukee, Providence, Dallas, U.S. Route 66, Harlem, New York City, the Pacific Coast Highway, St. Paul, Cincinnati, Rochester, Omaha, Green Bay, Savannah, Oahu, Charlotte and Jackson, as well as a \"Street Eats\" special and a Thanksgiving \"Feast\" special. After a special preview episode on May 25, 2011 at 9PM ET/PT, \"Man v. Food Nation\" premiered on June 1, 2011, with back-to-back episodes in New Haven and Tampa, and concluded on April 11, 2012 with back-to-back episodes in Charlotte and Jackson.\n\n\nThe final record for this season was 11 wins for \"Man\" and 16 wins for \"Food\", and this was the first season in which \"Food\" won both the season opener and the finale, and most of all, \"Food\" had more wins than \"Man.\"\n\nThis was Richman's final season on the show.\n\nAfter five years in hiatus, Travel Channel revived \"Man v. Food\" for a fifth season. With former host Adam Richman moving on to other food shows, Casey Webb, a food enthusiast and actor who worked in the restaurant business, continues what Richman started. Webb will travel the country in search of legendary eating challenges at the most unique eateries in America.\n\nWebb visited eateries in New York City, Milwaukee, Charleston, New Orleans, Sleepy Hollow, Houston, Portland (Oregon), Chicago, Des Moines and Billings, and his first season tally was 5 wins for \"Man\" and 5 wins for \"Food\".\n\nSeason six of \"Man v. Food\", the second hosted by Webb, premiered on December 4, 2017 with back-to-back episodes in Los Angeles and Boston. In inclusion, Webb also visited eateries in Louisville, St. Louis, Seattle, Burlington, Pittsburgh, San Diego, Daytona Beach, Philadelphia, Boise, the Ozarks, Nashville, and Grand Rapids. His second season tally ended up at 8 wins for \"Man\" and 6 wins for \"Food\".\n\nSeason seven of \"Man v. Food\", and the third hosted by Webb, premiered on the Travel Channel on May 28, 2018 with back-to-back episodes on the Jersey Shore and in Minneapolis. In addition, Webb also visited Atlanta, Worcester, Savannah, Palm Springs, Baltimore, Orange County, Duluth, Phoenix, St. Paul, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and Maui. The final tally for this season was 7 wins for \"Man\" and 7 wins for \"Food\".\n\nOn March 3, 2010, \"Man v. Food: Carnivore Edition\" aired. The episode was mainly a compilation of clips from Richman's more \"carnivorous\" food stops. Some clips included barbecue in Amarillo, Texas, and the Thurman Burger in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nOn October 27, 2010, a special series of episodes, \"Man v. Food presents Carnivore Chronicles\" debuted on the Travel Channel; this series features clips from past meat-related episodes, including some segments that were featured in previous clip shows, with some unseen material included. This series is seen Wednesday nights at 9 pm ET.\n\nOther clip shows included a \"Breakfast Edition\", featuring the series' most memorable breakfast dishes; a \"Dessert Edition\" and a \"Tailgate Edition\" were also shown.\n\nAnother clip show was \"Man v. Food's Greatest Moments\", which featured the challenges in Amarillo, New Orleans, New Brunswick, Fifth Third Ballpark (Comstock Park), San Francisco, San Jose, Little Rock, Washington D.C., and San Antonio, and featured commentary on the challenges by Adam.\n\nThe newest clip show, \"Amazing Eats\", premiered in January 2012, and it features previous \"Man v. Food\" and \"Man v. Food Nation\" clips in episodes set by certain themes (cheese, pork, burgers, etc.).\n\nOn January 27, 2012, Richman announced his retirement from food challenges. No exact reason was given as to why Richman retired, other than moving on and wishing his audience farewell. Explaining the show's re-tooling to become \"Man V. Food Nation\", Scripps Networks chairman Ken Lowe cited concerns over ensuring Adam Richman's health if the show had continued in its previous format. Rumors Richman had since turned vegan were found to be untrue, though it is true he has since lost about . On Friday, August 5, 2016, Adam tweeted \"I honestly have begun to feel bad for those buying in to the tabloid rumors suggesting I'm anything but an omnivore.\"\n\nThe \"Man vs Food\" logo (seasons 1-2) is almost identical to a well known eatery established in Mexico City in 1992. The logo for \"El Cuadrilatero\" (\"The ring\") differs very slightly from that of the TV show in that a coffee cup is present instead of a chicken leg.\n\n\n"}

G. Wodehouse and music by Frank E. Tours, with additional numbers by Guy Jones and Melville Gideon, from a book by Bovill and Wodehouse. It was performed at the Empire Theatre, London, opening on 3 January 1914. The show closed on 28 March 1914, after a run of 12 weeks.\n\nThe revue did not have a coherent plot, its six scenes being linked only by a surreal vision of an England changed beyond recognition and by the appearance in each scene of the character of Mr Punch, as comp√®re:\n\nScene 1 ‚Äì New Eton\n\nScene 2 ‚Äî \"New News\"\n\nScene 3 ‚Äì New \"Mayflower\"\n\nScene 4 ‚Äì New Ellis Island\n\nScene 5 ‚Äì New Little Theatre\n\nScene 6 ‚Äì New Empire Stores\n\nTwo other scenes‚Äîthe New Clown and the New Idol‚Äîseem to have been dropped before the show opened.\n\nEach scene provided a setting for a series of songs and dances, mostly satirising topics of the day, with frequent references to well-known personalities or topical events.\n\nIn the first scene, the playing fields of Eton have been turned into a market garden, and the school curriculum has been reduced to just three subjects, music hall, tango (taught by music-hall star Gertie Millar), and agriculture.\n\nThe second scene is set in the offices of the \"New News\", a newspaper that has absorbed \"The Times\" and whose editor‚Äîone George L. Washington of Pittsburg, grandson of the famous president‚Äîprints the news first, then makes it happen. The newspaper's gossip columnist is Lady Teazle, actually one of the characters in Sheridan's \"The School for Scandal\".

The real vicar of Brixton, the Rev A J Waldron, had recently authored a \"semi-morality play\"., and Johnson, to the annoyance of many music-hall artistes, had been engaged to appear at a number of music halls. The play-with-a-play is performed by caricatures of well-known theatrical entertainers, including George Graves, Edmund Payne, Wilkie Bard, and Mrs Patrick Campbell.\n\nThe final scene is set in the New Empire Stores and is a parody of \"Within the Law\", a play (adapted from that of Bayard Veiller) which was then being performed at the Haymarket Theatre. and which featured a department store, the Emporium. The scene also included a sketch parodying another popular play, the French farce \"Who's the Lady\", by Jose Levy, which had opened at the Garrick Theatre in November 1913.\n\nAmong those appearing in the revue, the following were specifically mentioned in the reviews or advertisements:\n\n\nThe revue had a mixed reception. \"The Daily Express\" noted that \"half a dozen scintillating items ... in these days of much dulness is probably not a bad achievement\", but remarked of the script by Bovill and Wodehouse that \"it does little credit to their ingenuity\". The \"Express\" reserved most praise for the dancing of Phyllis Bedells, who was \"thunderously cheered\" for what it described as \"the one purely and delightfully artistic contribution of the whole entertainment\".\n\n\"The Times\" referred to \"a number of clever artists for the most part making good fun out of material that was not very funny\" and commented that \"for lack of wit in the treatment, some of the best things miss fire\", while the London correspondent of the \"Sydney Morning Herald\", in paragraph on the continuing craze for revues in England, dismissed it as \"not a very brilliant specimen\".\n\nThe \"Express\" described the first scene as \"one of the best\" and referred to \"the final brilliance of the New Empire Stores\", but considered the marionette show in the fifth scene to be \"very clever, but over-long\". In sharp contrast, \"The Observer\" concluded: \"Perhaps the most successful of all the scenes is the play at the New Little Theatre.\" But the \"Observer\"'s final summing-up matched that of the other reviews: \"For the rest, there did not seem to us to be quite as much novelty about the revue as the titles of the scenes suggested.\"\n\nDespite their reservations, most of the reviews noted that the show was \"very heartily applauded at the close\", which may explain why it was performed nightly for 12 weeks; and it seems that the run came to an end not because the show was unsuccessful but because the management of the Empire Theatre changed during March 1914 and the new management‚ÄîAlfred Butt and Charles B. Cochran‚Äîwanted a change.\n\n\"Nuts and wine\" is a reference to the British tradition of serving walnuts with the port that was passed around at the end of a dinner.\n"}

According to the character's creator T≈çru Iwatani, the inspiration was pizza without a slice, which gave him a vision of \"an animated pizza, racing through a maze and eating things with its absent-slice mouth\". However, he said in a 1986 interview that the design of the character also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for a mouth, \"kuchi\". The character's name comes from , an onomatopoeic Japanese word for gobbling something up. The character's name was originally written in English as \"Puck-Man\", but when Namco localized the game for the United States they changed it to \"Pac-Man\", fearing that vandals would change the P in Puck to an F.\n\nThe arcade art on the original Pac-Man portrayed him as a yellow circle with a large mouth as well as hands, feet, eyes and a long nose. In-game Pac-Man was represented as a two-dimensional sprite of a simple yellow circle with a mouth, which is his current design as of 2018. 1984's \"Pac-Land\" was the first game (of many) to use his arcade art in-game. More recently Pac-Man appears as a full three-dimensional polygonal model. His design went through two minor changes from the Puck-Man cabinet art over the years, the first made his nose smaller in the 1990s and the second altered his eyes and shoes in 2010.\n\nPac-Man first appeared in the original action game of the same name. Despite \"Pac-Man\"s legacy, Pac-Man himself would not appear again until the 1982 arcade release of \"Super Pac-Man\", which introduced a change into Super Pac-Man (Pac-Man increased in size and invulnerability). Later arcade games include \"Pac-Land\", \"Pac-Mania\" and \"Pac-Man Arrangement\", a remake of the original \"Pac-Man\". \"Pac-Man World\" was released in 1999 on the PlayStation, and introduced new abilities to him (reminiscent to Mario's and Sonic the Hedgehog's abilities). The game contributed heavily to the series as well as the character and spawned two sequels and a spin-off as well. \"Pac-Man World 2\" features Pac-Man on an adventure to rescue Pac-Land from an ancient spirit known as Spooky. \"Pac-Man World 3\" was released in 2005 to celebrate Pac-Man's 25th anniversary. In \"Pac 'n Roll\", a young Pac-Man is being trained by the great Pac-Master.\n\nSeveral spin-offs have been released, such as a racing game \"Pac-Man World Rally\". Midway Games established a spin-off titled \"Ms. Pac-Man\" (featuring Pac-Man's wife of the same name), which was created without Namco's consent. Pac-Man appears in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\" as a playable guest fighter, riding a giant Mokujin robot, and in \"Everybody's Golf 6\" as a playable guest golfer (through DLC). Pac-Man has also appeared in all three \"Mario Kart Arcade GP\" installments as a playable racer along with Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nPac-Man was recently threatened by lawyers from NAMCO thretening to sue him out of oblivian so he now resides in unblocked games for school websites. Pac-Man is also a playable character in \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS\" and \"Wii U\", co-developed by Sora Ltd. and Bandai Namco Games. Sporting his classic design used in artwork for the original game and in the \"Pac-Man World\" trilogy, Pac-Man's moveset is based around early \"Pac-Man\" games and various other Namco arcade titles, such as deploying a Power Pellet and dashing after it, summoning fire hydrants from \"Pac-Land\", or jumping on the trampoline from \"Mappy\". An Amiibo figure released of Pac-Man also allows \"Pac-Man\" elements to appear in compatible Nintendo titles, such as \"Mario Kart 8\" and \"Super Mario Maker\". Pac-Man is set to return as a playable character in \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\".\n\n\"Pac-Man Fever\", a hit single named after the character, reached number nine on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the United States in March 1982 and was certified Gold by the RIAA that same month. In the late 2000s, a feature film was reported to be in development. The character was the main mascot of the children's play area Pac-Man Land which was located in Six Flags Over Texas from 1983‚Äì1985, before it was changed to Looney Tunes Land.\n\nPac-Man starred in the 1982‚Äì1983 \"Pac-Man\" cartoon voiced by Marty Ingels. In the series, Pac-Man works to keep Mezmaron and the Ghost Monsters from finding the Power Pellet Forest.\n\nIn 2010, a computer-generated animated series was reported to be in the works. It was later revealed as \"Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures\", which aired on Disney XD in 2013. The series revolves around a teenage Pac-Man (aka Pacster or Pac), who protects Pac-World from ghosts alongside his high school friends.\n\nThe character has made numerous cameo appearances in various television cartoon series and movies, including \"Tron\", \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" (episodes \"Gang Buster's\" and \"Buster and Babs Go Hawaiian\"), \"The Simpsons\" (episode \"Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass\"), \"Futurama\" (episode \"Anthology of Interest II\" voiced by David Herman), \"South Park\" (episode \"Imaginationland Episode III\"), \"Drawn Together\" (episodes \"Gay Bash\" and \"Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care\"), \"Family Guy\" (episodes \"Stuck Together, Torn Apart\", \"\", and \"Candy, Quahog Marshmallow\"), \"Annoying Orange\" (episode \"Pacmania\"), \"Robot Chicken\" (episodes \"Tubba-Bubba's Now Hubba-Hubba\" and \"Fool's Goldfinger\"), \"Mad\", \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\", \"Wreck-It Ralph\", and its sequel \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\".\n\nPac-Man also appears, in a larger role (including being prominently featured in promotional posters), in the 2015 film \"Pixels\" among the arcade game characters that the aliens unleash as monsters upon Earth. His creator T≈çru Iwatani also appears in the movie as an Electric Dreams Factory Arcade repairman while Denis Akiyama portrays the film's T≈çru Iwatani, who tries to reason with Pac-Man only to get his right arm pixelated upon it being bitten by Pac-Man.\n\nIn Japan, the 2016 tokusatsu film \"Kamen Rider Heisei Generations: Dr. Pac-Man vs. Ex-Aid & Ghost with Legend Riders\" features Pac-Man, as well as a villain character named Dr. Pac-Man portrayed by Shir≈ç Sano. A transformation based on Pac-Man also appears in the \"Kamen Rider Ex-Aid\" side series, \"Kamen Rider Genm\".\n\nPac-Man is often portrayed as a family man, as a result of the multiple spin-offs of his games which star family members. He is often seen married to Ms. Pac-Man, and the father to either one or two children. In many incarnations he also has a pet dog, named Chomp-Chomp in his most famous depiction in the cartoon and Pac-Land. They are often seen living inside of a house shaped like Pac-Man's face with windows for eyes and a door in place of his mouth. In the cartoon series, this house was painted white, while often in the games it is painted yellow. \"Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures\", the new 2013 cartoon, portrays Pac-Man as being a high schooler who goes to school with friends Cylindria and Spiral.\n\nIn the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series, he nicknames Ms. Pac-Man \"Pepper\", Baby Pac-Man is a boy (in the games, she is a girl with a bow like her mother's) and he also had a pet cat named Sourpuss. The second season of the cartoon introduced Pac-Man Jr. as a greaser who was actually Pac-Man's nephew, and Super Pac-Man who was not Pac-Man himself, but a separate character who came into scenes after unzipping a zipper in the middle of the open sky. \"Pac-Land\" marks the first official use of Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Baby in a Namco title.\n\nPac-Man himself is often characterized as happy-go-lucky and fun loving, often with a voracious appetite, who enjoys adventure but often prefers a quiet family life. His first platforming title, Pac-Land, illustrating him taking frequent breaks between levels at signs that said \"Break Time\" while ending three-level arcs by returning to his home, leading to cutscenes where he is seen sitting with his family at dinner and sleeping in his bed. \"Pac-Man 2\" begins with Pac-Man doing chores for his family, with various elements of the game causing him to abruptly change his mood from happy, to sad, to angry, to silly, and even flaky. It culminates with the Ghost Witch's plot to create a monster made of chewed bubble-gum sparking a sense of heroism in Pac-Man causing him to seek out the witch and put a stop to her plot. The \"Pac-Man World\" series portrays Pac-Man as being generally happy, though slightly sarcastic, protecting his family, and ultimately his whole world from an evil-doing ghost named Orson and his plans to take over Pac-Land from the spectral zone, where the Ghosts from his games are said to come from.\n\nPac-Man's job varies from game-to-game. In the Hanna-Barbera animated series he is said to be the protector of the Power Pellet Forest, which the main villain Mezmaron hopes to infiltrate and steal power pellets for energy to use in his evil schemes. In the games, he is often portrayed as not having a job, but is recognized throughout Pac-Land as a hero who constantly rids them from the threat of ghosts. Pac-Man World indicates that he has a job, since he is seen walking home from work with a lunchbox in hand, but it is never specified exactly what his job is. Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures portrays Pac-Man as a student.\n\nPac-Man has had a variety of arch enemies through the years. The mysterious Mezmaron, the villain of the Hanna-Barbera series, used the five main \"ghost-monsters\" (as they were called in the television series) from the game ‚Äî Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde and Sue ‚Äî as henchmen in his plot to steal the power pellets from the Power Pellet forest. His second nemesis, the Ghost Witch, appeared in \"Pac-Man 2\" and \"Pac-In-Time\", also using the main five ghosts from the games as henchmen. In the first game, she attempted to take over Pac-Man's city by creating a monster out of pre-chewed gum. In the second, she attempted to rid herself of Pac-Man by banishing him to a time warp. The \"Pac-Man World\" games' main villain was Orson, an ordinary ghost who was also an inventive genius. Orson was the villain in the first title, but assisted Pac-Man in the third game against a greater threat to the both of them, Erwin. Spooky, a ghost once vanished by Pac-a-Lot, that was freed (albeit unintentionally) by Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde. In Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, the villain is Betrayus, the dead brother of President Spheros.\n\nPac-Man's relationship to the original four ghosts who appeared in his game is usually one of friendly antagonism. In virtually every game and cartoon Pac-Man sees the ghosts as a nuisance rather than a threat, and often has a power pellet handy to dispatch their bullying attempts in an instant. The ghosts in turn are often portrayed as being crude, boorish, and bullying but ultimately bumbling and useless in their attempts to get the better of Pac-Man. In \"Ghostly Adventures\", the girl ghost Pinky has a crush on Pac.\n\nWhat happens to Pac-Man when he is caught by the ghosts varies. The cartoon made stated that if the ghosts \"chomped\" Pac-Man, he would temporarily lose his skeleton. However, after seeing that as too graphic for children, later seasons instead stated that Pac-Man would be temporarily weakened after being chomped. \"Pac-Man 2\" indicated that the Ghosts were actually adept at scaring Pac-Man, often by making funny faces, and Pac-Man was powerless against them unless he had a Power Pellet. \"Pac-Man World\" simply indicates that when Pac-Man touches a ghost, it is similar to them coming to blows with one another. The 2011 cartoon pilot suggests that Pac-Man could actually eat the ghosts without the aid of a power-pellet, but if he does the ghost turns into tasteless goo in Pac-Man's mouth which he would prefer not to eat.\n\nSince the release of \"Pac-Man\" in 1980, Pac-Man has become a social phenomenon and became an icon of the video game industry, as well as popular culture. According to the Davie-Brown Index (DBI), Pac-Man has the highest brand awareness of any video game character among American consumers, recognized by 94 percent of them (surpassing Mario and Sonic). \"Mario\" creator Shigeru Miyamoto even stated that Pac-Man was his favorite video game character. Pac-Man was the first character inducted at Twin Galaxies' International Video Game Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 73rd \"most memorable, influential, and badass\" protagonist in games, commenting: \"Toru Iwatani's simple, iconic, timeless character design has seen Pac-Man endure for more than 30 years and become an established visual shorthand for gaming and gaming culture all over the world.\"\n\nThe term \"Pac-Man defense\" in mergers and acquisitions refers to a hostile takeover target that attempts to reverse the situation and take over its would-be acquirer instead, a reference to Pac-Man's Power Pellets. Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao was nicknamed \"Pac-Man\", as was American football player Adam Jones.\n"}

{"id": "20895725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20895725", "title": "Research in Music Education", "text": "Research in Music Education\n\nIn \"A Guide to Research in Music Education,\" Phelps, Ferrara and Goolsby define research as the identification and isolation of a problem into a workable plan; the implementation of that plan to collect the data needed; and the synthesis, interpretation and presentation of the collected information into some format which readily can be made available to others. Research typically falls into one of four categories: experimental, descriptive, historical, or philosophical.\n\nExperimental research is used to determine what will be or to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. An example of experimental research is a 2000 study by Prickett and Bridges. The purpose of the study was to determine if the basic song repertoire of vocal/choral music education majors is significantly better than instrumental music education majors. The study revealed no significant difference between the two groups, and that neither group had developed a strong repertoire of standard songs outside of the college music classroom. The impact of the study was the recommendation that professors preparing music education students for their future careers consider adding activities to music education courses that build a strong song repertoire.\n\nDescriptive research is used to determine what is and is usually conducted for one of three purposes:\nThere are three broad categories of descriptive research: survey studies, relationship studies, and development studies.\n\nA survey is a systematic method of collecting information on one or more variables. An example of a survey study is a 1998 study by Gillespie and Hamann. The purpose of the study was to gather descriptive information about orchestra programs that can be used as baseline data when considering the needs of school string programs. The findings indicated a continued enrollment increase in school orchestras in the 1990s although the number of orchestra teachers remained stable, and that larger schools are more likely to offer orchestra instruction. The impact of the study was the recommendation that school systems should provide larger, more adequate teaching facilities and that universities and string teachers should emphasize strategies for teaching larger string classes in their teacher preparation programs.\n\nDevelopment studies collect information on existing situations, determine relationships, and examine changes in these variables over a period of time. Development studies include:\n\nHistorical research refers to the collection of data to record and interpret past events. Source materials used by the historical researcher are normally of two kinds, primary and secondary. A primary source is first-hand information, observed directly by the researcher. A secondary source is second-hand information, not original to the researcher. Through the process of external criticism, the researcher learns whether or not the object of scrutiny is authentic. Through the process of internal criticism, the researcher determines if the information contained in the object is credible. An example of historical research is a 1993 study by Gruhn. The purpose of the study was to determine if Lowell Mason's \"Manual of the Boston Academy of Music for the Instruction in the Elements of Vocal Music on the System of Pestalozzi\" is truly based on Pestalozzian principles. A detailed comparison of the \"Manual,\" a work by Pfeiffer and Nageli, and a work by Kubler revealed that the Pfeiffer and Nageli work is much closer to the ideas advocated by Pestalozzi than the Kubler work, and that Mason's \"Manual\" is little more than a translation of Kubler.\n\nPhilosophical research is used to examine the underlying principles in any field. An example of philosophical research is a 1999 article by Bennett Reimer published in \"The Music Educators Journal\": \"Facing the Risks of the Mozart Effect.\" This article is a response to the practice of music educators who advocated music education because of its relationship to spatial task performance. A 1993 research report from the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irving by Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky is an example of the research literature that supported what became to be known as \"the Mozart Effect.\" Reimer rejects spatial task performance as justification for music education because, according to Reimer's aesthetic philosophy, music education should be justified by its merit as an art, not for extra-musical reasons.\n\nIn 1837 the Connecticut General Assembly voted to collect educational data. Questionnaires were sent to all Connecticut schools in 1838. Eight questions were about music instruction. This was probably the first attempt in the U.S. to collect data on music instruction on a wide-scale basis and perhaps the earliest example of research in music education.\n\nIn 1918 the Educational Council was established by the Music Supervisors National Conference (later the Music Educators National Conference or ). The Educational Council published bulletins, mostly based on survey data and including recommendations for the profession. One such bulletin was \"The Present Status of Music Instruction in Colleges and High Schools 1919-1920.\" In 1923 the name of the organization was changed form Educational Council to the National Research Council of Music Education. The name changed again in 1932 to the Music Education Research Council. The \"Journal of Research in Music Education\" began publication in 1953 under the editorship of Allen Britton. At first many of the articles were based on historical and descriptive research, but in the early 1960s the journal began to shift to experimental research. The Society for Research in Music Education was established in 1960, and in 1963 the \"Journal of Research in Music Education\" became its official publication. The MENC Historical Center was established in 1965. In 1978, MENC founded several Special Research Interest Groups.\n\nPrice and Chang (2000) provide an overview of the many diverse music education research journals including annotation and publication details for each source. While the \"Journal of Research in Music Education\" continues to be the dominant journal in the field, other journals include the \"Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education,\" \"The Missouri Journal of Research in Music Education,\" \"The Bulletin of Research, Contributions to Music Education, The Bulletin of Historical Research in Music Education,\" and \"Update: The Applications of Research in Music Education. \" Research on the impact of music education research journals includes investigations of initial citation speeds (Hancock, 2015) and accumulated citations (Hamann & Lucas, 1998).\n\nOne of the dominant events in the field of music education research was the 1992 publication of the \"Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning.\" Edited by Richard Colwell, the \"Handbook\" contains fifty-five chapters written by more than seventy scholars. Colwell edited a second volume in 2002, \"The New Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning.\"\n\nTo see the shift of emphasis that has taken place in music education research in recent years, one need only compare the contents of the 1992 volume and the 2002 volume. The inclusion of sections on \"Conceptual Framework\" and \"Evaluation\" in the 1992 volume is evidence of emphasis on standards and a set body of knowledge. The absence of similar sections in the 2002 volume is evidence of a shift toward a pragmatic philosophical and a constructivist teaching theory. The inclusion of a section on \"related arts\" in the 2002 volume recalls the research of the late 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBroomhead, P. (2001).

Ring girls are often seen in boxing, kickboxing and mixed martial arts.\n\nRing girls first appeared in a 1965 edition of \"Ring Magazine\". The magazine published a photo of a Las Vegas model holding a sign at a boxing match. Boxing promotions adapted the concept of ring girls at their events.\n\nIn professional wrestling, ring girls are attendants who remove the entrance gear (such as jackets, robes, and other clothing) and championship belts from the ring after a wrestler takes them off before his match. Throughout the 1980s, World Wrestling Entertainment employed ring girls known as the Federettes. Since its inception in 2002, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling has featured various independent female wrestlers and valets as ring girls.\n\nDuring the first year of \"WWF Monday Night Raw\", WWE featured traditional boxing-style ring girls who carried signs featuring various \"Raw\"-themed slogans in the ring between matches.\n\n\"Playboy\" is an American entertainment magazine. Here is a list of notable ring girls who have posed for \"Playboy\". \nSome sports viewers, medias and fighters claim that ring girls are unnecessary. Ring girls first appeared in boxing, when viewers are mostly men. Having half-naked women at the games provided sexual attraction. \"We have women as part of the actual athletic competition in MMA,\" argued sports columnist Ben Fowlkes, \"We have a multitude of female fans.\" Sports journalist Malissa Smith called ring girls \"blatant sexual exploitation\".\n\nIn contrast, some people see ring girls as a harmless tradition. Boxing promoter Lisa Elovich calls the practice \"part of the show.\" Neuroscientist Jack Pemment argues that ring girls help grow modeling careers for women.\n\n\"Ring boys\" or \"ring guys\" have been proposed for women's matches. Pro-boxer Mikaela Laur√©n said \"I want a number boy. I think that's only fair, and I'm sure it will give the women in the audience some pleasure as well.\"\n\nWhile all-female fighting promotion Invicta FC utilizes ring girls, the promotion brought in UFC fighter and sometimes model Elias Theodoreau to serve as a ring boy at Invicta FC 28. In an appearance on Ariel Helwani's The MMA Hour, Theodoreau said that \"Mixed martial arts has been at the forefront of equality in many different ways. You can see in regards to women being on top of pay-per-views and selling millions and also now myself included as the first ring boy.‚Äù\n\nTheodoreau received criticism, however, for using the occasion to promote sponsors, and for showing less skin than a ring girl traditionally would.\n\nThere were speculations that ring girls are paid more than some female athletes. In 2015, former UFC bamtamweight champion Ronda Rousey protested. \"Do you think her walking in circles, \" argued Rousey, \"is worth more (than fighters)? ... either the ring card girls are paid too much, or the fighters aren't paid enough.\" UFC ring girls are reputedly paid $18,000 a year. This excludes jobs outside the UFC, like modeling. UFC ring girl Arianny Celeste protested, calling Rousey a \"big bully\". \"I think people don't realise how much work it is to be a model,\" argued Celeste, \"Trying being like a live mannequin and having clients put you in a million different outfits... It's not as easy as it looks... Not a lot of people would know that unless they were in my shoes.\"\n\n"}

The use of transistors allowed the device to be much smaller than earlier vacuum tube radios. \n\nAkio Morita and Masaru Ibuka, then operating under the business name Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, had been working on plans to introduce a transistor radio to the market since 1953. When the TR-55 was released in Japan in August 1955, it was the first transistor radio marketed in that country. The TR-55 featured the Sony name, but the company did not officially change its name to Sony until January 1958.\n\nIn the fall of 1955, Morita met with a representative of the Bulova watch company in New York City. Bulova agreed to order 10,000 units on the condition they carry the Bulova name. Morita declined the deal. Sony later signed a deal with New York importer Adolph Gross to distribute an improved and slightly more compact model, and in March 1957, the Sony TR-63 transistor radio would become Sony's first product sold in the US. The TR-63 would not fit in existing shirt front pockets, so the company issued shirts with expanded pockets to salesmen so they could claim the product was \"the world's first pocket sized transistor radio\".\n\nPowered by four AA batteries, the TR-55 used a superheterodyne circuit incorporating two AF stages and covered the medium wave broadcast band. The TR-55 used the following transistors: \n\nThe TR-55's five transistors were designed in house by Sony, the technology having been licensed from Bell Labs. This made Sony the first company to produce commercial transistor radios from the ground up. American company Regency had launched their Regency TR-1 transistor radio earlier in 1954, but bought the transistors from Texas Instruments. Printed circuit boards were used, which was unusual for the time.\n\nThe speaker grille was made from punched aluminum, and its design was reportedly inspired by Lincoln Motor Company automobiles of the era. Although it was not as compact as originally intended, the relatively small size of the TR-55 was a novelty, and attracted the attention of Japanese consumers.\n\n"}

The $64,000 Challenge (1956‚Äì1958) was its spin-off show.\n\n\n\"The $64,000 Question\" had its roots in the CBS radio quiz show, \"Take It or Leave It\", which followed in the wake of the pioneering \"Professor Quiz\" (radio's first quiz program) and \"Uncle Jim's Question Bee\" (the second radio quiz show). \"Take It or Leave It\" ran from April 21, 1940 to July 27, 1947. It was first hosted by Bob Hawk (1940‚Äì41), followed by Phil Baker (1941‚Äì47).\n\nContestants were asked questions devised by the series' writer-researcher Edith Oliver. She attempted to make each question slightly more difficult than the preceding one. After answering a question correctly, the contestant had the choice to \"take\" the prize for that question or \"leave it\" in favor of a chance at the next question. The first question was worth one dollar, and the value doubled for each successive question, up to the seventh and final question worth $64.\n\nDuring the 1940s, \"That's the $64 question\" became a common catchphrase for a particularly difficult question or problem. In addition to the common phrase \"Take it or leave it\", the show also popularized another phrase, widely spoken in the 1940s as a taunt but now mostly forgotten (except in Warner Bros. cartoons). Chanted in unison by the entire audience when someone chose to risk their winnings by going for the $64 prize, it was vocalized with a rising inflection: \"You'll be sorrr-REEEE!\"\n\nThe popularity of the radio program inspired a 1944 20th Century Fox feature film, \"Take It or Leave It\", about a man who needs $1,000 to pay his wife's obstetrician. When he is chosen as a contestant on the radio quiz show, the prize money is increased beyond the usual $64.\n\nIn 1947, the series switched to NBC, hosted at various times by Baker, Garry Moore (1947‚Äì49), Eddie Cantor (1949‚Äì50) and Jack Paar (beginning June 11, 1950). On September 10, 1950, the title of \"Take It or Leave It\" was changed to \"The $64 Question\". Paar continued as host, followed by Baker (March‚ÄìDecember 1951) and Paar (back on December 1951). The series continued on NBC Radio until June 1, 1952.\n\nOnly five recordings of \"Take It or Leave It\" are known to survive.\n\n\"The $64,000 Question\" was created by Louis G. Cowan, formerly known for radio's \"Quiz Kids\" and the television series \"Stop the Music\" and \"Down You Go\". He drew the inspiration for the name from the earlier show \"Take It or Leave It\", and its $64 top prize offering. He decided to expand the figure to $64,000 for the new television program. Cowan had difficulty locating sponsorship for \"The $64,000 Question\". Cosmetics giant Helena Rubenstein, which eventually did become a familiar television advertiser, rejected the idea, reportedly because its wealthy founding namesake did not own a television set at the time and had no idea of the medium's advertising potential. The Chrysler Corporation turned down the chance to launch the show because the automaker reportedly feared sponsoring a big-money quiz show would outrage company workers whose wages they were trying not to inflate. A vacuum cleaner company also said no to Cowan, reportedly because the concept would be too glamorous for its product.\n\nFinally, Cowan convinced Revlon. The key: Revlon founder and chieftain Charles Revson knew top competitor Hazel Bishop had fattened its sales through sponsoring the popular \"This Is Your Life\", and he wanted a piece of that action if he could have it. According to \"Fire and Ice\" (1976), Andrew Tobias' biography of Revson, Revlon first signed a deal to sponsor Cowan's brainchild for 13 weeks with the right to withdraw when they expired.\n\n\"The $64,000 Question\" premiered June 7, 1955 on CBS-TV, sponsored by cosmetics maker Revlon and originating from the start live from CBS-TV Studio 52 in New York (later the disco-theater Studio 54). The first contestant on the show was Thelma Farrell Bennett, [a NYC fashion model from Trenton, New Jersey] who failed to make it to the first plateau but won a 1955 Cadillac convertible which she sold a month after taking delivery. \n\nTo increase the show's drama and suspense, it was decided to use an actor rather than a broadcaster as the host. Television and film actor Hal March, familiar to TV viewers as a supporting regular on \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\" and \"My Friend Irma\", found instant fame as the quiz show's host, and Lynn Dollar stood nearby as his assistant. Author and TV panelist Dr. Bergen Evans was the show's expert authority, and actress Wendy Barrie did the \"Living Lipstick\" commercials. (Coincidentally, in 1978, Evans and Barrie died within 72 hours of each other.) To capitalize on the initial television success, the show was also simulcast for two months on CBS Radio where it was heard from October 4, 1955 to November 29, 1955.\n\nThe J. Fred & Leslie W. MacDonald Collection of the Library of Congress contains one kinescoped episode featuring Virgil Earp, elderly nephew of Wyatt Earp, winning $32,000. It was broadcast in early 1958.\n\nContestants first chose a subject category (such as \"Boxing\", \"Lincoln\" or \"Jazz\") from the Category Board. Although this board was a large part of the set, it was seen only briefly, evidently to conceal the fact that categories were sometimes hastily added to match a new contestant's subject. The contestant would then be asked questions only in the chosen category, earning money which doubled ($64, $128, $256 to $512, then $1,000, $2,000, $4,000, $8,000, $16,000, $32,000 to $64,000) as the questions became more difficult. At the $4,000 level, a contestant would return each week for only one question per week. They could quit at any time and retire with their money, but until they won $512, if they got a question wrong, they were eliminated without winning anything. Missing a question worth between $1,000 and $4,000 left the contestant with $512. Once the contestant won $4,000, if they missed a question they received a consolation prize of a new Cadillac. Starting with the $8,000 question, they were placed in the Revlon \"isolation booth\", where they could hear nothing but the host's words. As long as the contestant kept answering correctly, they could stay on the show until they had won $64,000. The first contestant to win the top prize money, on September 13, 1955, was Richard S. McCutchen, a Marine whose subject was cooking. McCutchen became an instant celebrity, with people stopping him in the street to ask for his autograph.\n\nAlmost immediately, \"The $64,000 Question\" beat every other program on Tuesday nights in ratings. Broadcast historian Robert Metz, in \"CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye\", claimed U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower himself did not want to be disturbed while the show was on and that the nation's crime rate, movie theater, and restaurant patronage dropped dramatically when the show aired. It earned the #1 rating spot for the 1955‚Äì56 season, holding the distinction of being the only television show to knock \"I Love Lucy\" out of the #1 spot, and finished at #4 in the 1956‚Äì57 season and #20 in 1957‚Äì58. Among its imitators or inspirations were \"The Big Surprise\", \"Tic-Tac-Dough\", and \"Twenty-One\".\n\nNot only did Charles Revson not exercise his withdrawal right, but he wanted another way to take advantage of \"Question\"'s swollen audience. April 8, 1956 saw the debut of \"The $64,000 Challenge\" (initially co-sponsored by Revlon and Lorillard Tobacco Company's Kent cigarettes), hosted through August 26 by future children's television star Sonny Fox and then, for the remainder of the show's life, Ralph Story.\n\nIt pitted contestants against winners of at least $8,000 on \"The $64,000 Question\" in a new, continuing game where they could win another $64,000. The contestants took turns answering questions from the same category starting at the $1,000 level. If they each answered a question correctly, the next level would be twice that of the previous level. Starting at the $4,000 level, both contestants answered the same question while each standing in their own isolation booth. If, at any given level, a contestant answered correctly with the other contestant missing a question, the winning contestant may keep that money and face a new opponent or continue playing against the same challenger at the next money level.\n\nIn time, the sister show came to include various celebrities, including bandleader Xavier Cugat and child star Patty Duke, as well as former \"Question\" champions.\n\nThe J. Fred & Leslie W. MacDonald Collection of the Library of Congress contains one kinescoped episode featuring Capt. Richard McCutchen as a contestant. It was broadcast July 1, 1956.\n\n\"Question\" contestants sometimes became celebrities themselves for a short while, including 11-year-old Robert Strom (who won $192,000 (equal to $ today)) and Teddy Nadler ($252,000 across both shows (equal to $ today)), the two biggest winners in the show's history. Other such newly made celebrities included Italian-born Bronx shoemaker Gino Prato, who won $32,000 (equal to $ today) for his encyclopedic knowledge of opera. The longest enduring of these newly made celebrities was psychologist Joyce Brothers. Answering questions about boxing, she became, after McCutchen, the second top winner, and went on to a career providing psychological advice in newspaper columns and TV shows for the next four decades. Another winner, Pennsylvania typist Catherine Kreitzer, read Shakespeare on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". \"TV Guide\" kept a running tally of the money won on the show, which hit $1 million by the end of November 1956 (equal to $ today).\n\nThe \"American Experience\" (PBS) episode probing the scandal noted, \"All the big winners became instant celebrities and household names. For the first time, America's heroes were intellectuals or experts‚Äìjockey Billy Pearson on art, Marine Captain McCutchen on cooking‚Äìevery subject from the Bible to baseball. Not only had the contestants become rich overnight, but they were also treated to a whirlwind of publicity tours, awards, endorsements and meetings with dignitaries. Traveler Gino Prato, whose category was opera, was brought to Italy for a special performance at la Scala and honored by an audience with the Pope. After winning $64,000, spelling whiz Gloria Lockerman, an African American, became a guest speaker at the 1956 Democratic National Convention. She also appeared as a guest on NBC's \"The Martha Raye Show\" where she was warmly greeted by Martha Raye and fellow guest Tallulah Bankhead. Baseball expert Myrtle Power was made a sports commentator on CBS. Eleven-year-old stock market expert Lenny Ross was asked to open up the New York Stock Exchange. And with only an eighth-grade education, supply clerk Teddy Nadler, an expert on everything, won more money than any other contestant. It was a new kind of hero in America, a common person with the uncommon gift of knowledge.\"\n\nOne category on the Revlon Category Board was \"Jazz\", and within months of the premiere Columbia Records issued a 1955 album of various jazz artists under the tie-in title \"$64,000 Jazz\" (CL 777, also EP B-777), with the following tracks: \"The Shrike\" (Pete Rugolo), \"Perdido\" (J.J. Johnson, Kai Winding), \"Laura\" (Erroll Garner), \"Honeysuckle Rose\" (Benny Goodman), \"Tawny\" (Woody Herman), \"One O'Clock Jump\" (Harry James), \"How Hi the Fi\" (Buck Clayton), \"I'm Comin', Virginia\" (Eddie Condon), \"A Fine Romance\" (Dave Brubeck, Paul Desmond), \"I Let A Song Go Out of My Heart\" (Duke Ellington) and \"Ain't Misbehavin'\" (Louis Armstrong).\n\nOther musical tie-ins included the 1955 song \"The $64,000 Question (Do You Love Me)\", recorded by Bobby Tuggle (Checker 823), Jackie Brooks (Decca 29684) and the Burton Sisters (RCA Victor 47-6265). \"Love Is the $64,000 Question\" (1956), which used the show's theme music by Norman F. Leyden with added Fred Ebb lyrics, was recorded by Hal March (Columbia 40684), Karen Chandler (Decca 29881), Jim Lowe (Dot 15456) and Tony Travis (RCA Victor 47-6476).\n\nWhen the show was revived in 1976 as The $128,000 Question, its theme music and cues were performed (albeit with a new disco-style arrangement for the theme) by Charles Randolph Grean, who released a three-and-a-half-minute single, \"The $128,000 Question\" (the show's music and cues as an instrumental), with the B-side (\"Sentimentale\") on the Ranwood label (45rpm release R-1064). For the show's second season, Grean's music package was re-recorded by Guido Basso.\n\nThere were numerous parodies of the program, including in the Foghorn Leghorn cartoon \"Fox Terror\", Bob and Ray's \"The 64-Cent Question\". \"The Jack Benny Program\" featured Hal March as a contestant in an October 20, 1957 spoof with Benny asking the questions. As a gag, Benny actually appeared as a contestant on \"The $64,000 Question\" on October 8, 1957, but insisted on walking away with $64 after answering the first question. Hal March finally gave him $64 out of his own pocket.\n\nAt the height of its popularity, \"The $64,000 Question\" was referenced in the scripts of other CBS shows, usually but not exclusively through punch lines that included references to \"the isolation booth\" or \"reaching the first plateau.\" Typical of these was spoken by \"The Honeymooners\"' Ed Norton (Art Carney), who identified three times in a man's life when he wants to be alone, with the third being \"when he's in the isolation booth of \"The $64,000 Question\".\" At least three other \"Honeymooners\" episodes referenced \"Question\": In \"A Woman's Work Is Never Done\" Ralph proposes to Alice that he go on the show because he's an expert in the \"Aggravation\" category. In \"Hello, Mom\" Norton tells Ralph that his mother-in-law's category on the show would be \"Nasty\". In \"The Worry Wart\", Ralph advises Alice to become a contestant because she's an expert in the \"Everything\" category.\n\nAnother episode of \"The Honeymooners\", delivered one of the best known \"Question\" references ‚Äì a parody of the show itself, in one of the so-called \"Original 39\" episodes of the timeless situation comedy. In that episode, blustery bus driver Ralph Kramden becomes a contestant on the fictitious \"$99,000 Answer\". Regarded as one of the Golden Age of Television's best quiz show parodies, the \"Honeymooners\" episode depicted Kramden spending a week intensively studying popular songs, only to blow the first question on the subject when he returned to play on the show. The host of the fictitious \"$99,000 Answer\" was one Herb Norris, played by former \"Twenty Questions\" emcee and future \"Tic-Tac-Dough\" host Jay Jackson.\n\nThe show has been referenced on other game shows. On the U.S. version of \"Deal or No Deal\", an episode aired January 15, 2007, in which the banker's offer was $64,000. Host Howie Mandel said, \"This is the $64,000 question.\"\n\nThree years after it exploded into a nation's consciousness, \"Question\" and \"Challenge\" were dead. Having faded in popularity as it was, in the wake of the hugely popular \"Twenty-One\" championship of Charles Van Doren, \"Question\" and \"Challenge\" were yanked off the air within three months of the quiz show scandal's eruption. \"Challenge\" went first on September 14, 1958 with \"Question\"‚Äîonce the emperor of Tuesday-night television‚Äîtaking its Sunday-night timeslot after a three-month hiatus until it was killed on November 9.\n\nThe relatively new but phenomenally popular \"Dotto\", and then \"Twenty-One\", were found to have been rigged and were promptly canceled. A \"Challenge\" contestant, Rev. Charles Jackson, told the federal grand jury probing the quiz shows that he received answers during his screening for his appearance. That prompted \"Challenge\"'s sponsor, the Lorillard Tobacco Company (Kent, Old Gold cigarettes), to drop the show.\n\n\"The $64,000 Question\" had the opposite problem: sponsor Revlon‚Äîpossibly under pressure from its chieftain, Charles Revson, who has been credited with expressing the desire for famous faces that prompted \"Challenge\"'s expansion to include celebrities‚Äîoften tried to interfere with the production of \"Question\", including and especially trying to bump contestants it simply disliked, no matter whether the audience liked them. Revson's brother, Martin, was assigned to oversee \"Question\"‚Äìincluding heavy discussions of feedback the show received. The would-be bumpees included Joyce Brothers herself, who managed to outwit the question writers and Revlon long enough to win the maximum prize.\n\nAccording to producer Joe Cates in a PBS documentary on the scandals, he used an IBM sorting machine to give the illusion that the questions were randomly selected ‚Äì in fact, all of the cards were identical. Since all of the buttons were on one line , they were mostly for show.\n\nIt was revealed during Congressional investigations into the quiz show scandal that Revlon was as determined to keep the show appealing ‚Äì even if it meant manipulating the results ‚Äì as the producer of \"Twenty-One\" (albeit also under sponsor pressure) had been. Unlike \"Twenty-One\" and \"Dotto\", where contestants got the answers in advance, Revlon was reportedly far more subtle: they may have depended less on asking questions on the air that a contestant had already heard in pre-air screenings than on switching the questions kept secure in a bank vault at the last minute, to make sure a contestant the sponsor liked would be suited according to his or her chosen expertise.\n\nThe most prominent victim may have been the man who launched the franchise in the first place. Louis Cowan, made CBS Television president as a result of \"Question\"'s fast success, was forced out of the network as the quiz scandal ramped up, even though it was NBC's and not CBS' quiz shows bearing the brunt of the scandal ‚Äì and even though CBS itself, with a little help from sponsor Colgate-Palmolive, had moved fast in cancelling the popular \"Dotto\" at almost the moment it was confirmed that that show had been rigged. Cowan had never been suspected of taking part in any attempt to rig either \"Question\" or \"Challenge\"; later CBS historians suggested his reputation as an administrative bottleneck may have had as much to do with his firing as his tie to the tainted shows. Cowan may have been a textbook sacrificial lamb, in a bid to preempt any further scandal while the network scrambled to recover, and while president Frank Stanton accepted complete responsibility for any wrongdoing committed under his watch.\n\nThe quiz show scandals ultimately resulted in a \"shift in the power to program television\". The networks used the scandal as an argument to eliminate the abuse of sponsor controlled programming in prime-time broadcasting, which would then allow the networks to take control of program production into their own hands.\n\nBy the end of 1959, all first generation big-money quizzes were gone with single-sponsorship television following and a federal law against fixing television game shows (an amendment to the 1960 Communications Act) coming. Except for the skill-based \"Jackpot Bowling\" (1959‚Äì1961) and \"Make That Spare\" (1960‚Äì1964), a period on \"Beat the Clock\" (1960) when its Bonus Stunt grew in $100 increments past the $10,000 mark until finally being won for $20,100 on September 23, and the short-lived ABC quiz \"100 Grand\" (1963), the networks stayed away from awarding five-figure cash jackpots until the premiere of \"The $10,000 Pyramid\" and \"Match Game 73\" in 1973. The disappearance of the quiz shows gave rise to television's next big phenomenon‚ÄìWesterns.\n\nNone of the people directly involved in rigging any of the quiz shows faced any penalty more severe than suspended sentences for perjury before the federal grand jury that probed the scandal, even if many hosts and producers found themselves frozen out of television for many years. One \"Question\" contestant, Doll Goostree, sued both CBS and the producers in a bid to recoup $4,000 she said she might have won if her match of \"Question\" hadn't been rigged. Neither Goostree nor any other quiz contestant who similarly sued won their cases.\n\n\nSelected PBS outlets showed surviving kinescopes of the original \"Question\" in Summer 1976, as a run-up to a new version of the show called \"The $128,000 Question\", which ran for two years. The first season was hosted by Mike Darrow and produced at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City, while the second was produced at Global Television Network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and hosted by Alex Trebek.\n\nIn 1999, television producer Michael Davies attempted to revive \"Question\" as \"The $640,000 Question\" for ABC, before abandoning that project in favor of producing an American version of the British game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\". \"Millionaire\" has a very similar format to \"The $64,000 Question\" ‚Äì 15 questions (now 14) in which the contestant's money roughly doubles with each correct question until reaching the top prize. However, the questions in \"Millionaire\" are of a broader variety than \"Question\"'s one-category line of questioning and have a different category for each question, contestants are allowed to leave the game with their money after a question is revealed but before it is answered, and \"Millionaire\" offers three chances for help (called \"lifelines\"), which were not present in \"Question\".\n\nIn 2000, responding to the success of \"Millionaire\", CBS bought the rights to the property in a reported effort to produce another revival attempt, \"The $1,064,000 Question\", to be hosted by sportscaster Greg Gumbel. Because of format issues similar to those encountered by Davies for ABC, this version was never broadcast.\n\nA similar version was successful in Australia from 1960 to 1971 on Seven Network. Initially called \"Coles ¬£3000 Question\", the show changed its name to \"Coles $6000 Question\" on February 14, 1966 (the date Australia converted to decimal currency) and was sponsored for most of its run by Coles Supermarkets. In July 1971, Coles dropped its sponsorship and the show became \"The $7000 Question\". It was hosted by Malcolm Searle (1960-1963) and Roland Strong (1963-1971).\n\nThe Mexican version, \"El Gran Premio de los 64,000 pesos\" lasted from 1956 to 1994 with some interruptions, changes of name to compensate peso devaluation, and changes of TV network. Most of the time it was hosted by Pedro Ferriz. A movie was made in which Ferriz asks questions to a character played by Sara Garc√≠a, known then as \"Mexican Cinema's Granny.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" returned on January 2, 2008, after the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike, Conan said in his opening monologue, \"That brings us to the big $64,000 question of the evening: what do we do now?\" The writers had not returned when the show came back on the air.\n\nDavid Carradine's character \"Bill\" in the Movie \"Kill Bill: Vol 2\" (2004) references the show saying, \"Now comes the $64,000 question. Why did you run away from me with my baby?\" during one of his last conversations with \"The Bride\" (played by Uma Thurman).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27510856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27510856", "title": "Varsity Spirit", "text": "Varsity Spirit\n\nVarsity Spirit Corp. is an American organization that sells cheerleading and dance apparel, trains cheerleaders and dancers at educational camps and hosts cheerleading competitions. The company is best known for organizing and successfully staging large-scale cheerleading activities within the United States.\n\nIt has origins which trace back to 1948. Since its founding, Varsity Spirit has been known for its involvement in the cheerleading industry to make it dynamic and popular. In 1980, it hosted the first cheerleading championship called the National High School Cheerleading Championship and as of 2015, three of Varsity Spirit's national championships are televised on the ESPN Networks, including the National High School Cheerleading Championship, the National College Cheerleading and Dance Team Championship and the National Dance Team Championship. Select divisions are also aired live on ESPN 3.\n\nVarsity Spirit camps train 325,000 cheerleaders from colleges, high schools, middle schools, and all star programs at 1,500 camps sessions around the United States. In all, 475,000 cheerleaders and dance team members compete at Varsity Spirit events.\n\nVarsity Spirit was founded by Jeff Webb, a yell leader at the University of Oklahoma contemplating law school. While working in summers as a camp instructor for National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) with Lawrence Herkimer, he decided to start Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA). Webb had a vision to combine cheerleading with high energy entertainment and traditional school leadership. He founded UCA in 1974.\n\nWebb used marketing and promotional campaigns to increase cheerleading's profile. In 1983, ESPN first broadcast eight hours of Varsity's national championships, a relationship that continues to this day. In 2002, Webb was featured in a USA Today article entitled From Megaphones to Mega-Profits. Varsity worked on driving the development of an international phenomenon that now not only includes millions of young Americans, but also a rapidly growing number of participants worldwide. In 2004, they announced a merger to form the largest partnership in the cheerleading and dance team industry.\n\nIn June 2010, Jeff Webb was called upon Title IX Case: Quinnipiac University in the federal trial in Connecticut, as an expert witness to clarify if Competitive College Cheerleading was a Title IX Compliant Sport to allow for the Quinnipiac University Volleyball Team to be replaced by the less costlier Quinnipiac University All Girl Cheerleading Team as proposed by the Quinnipiac University Athletic Department.\n\nIn 2011, Varsity merged with Herff Jones, the Indianapolis-based provider of graduation, achievement and educational products and services, such as class rings and jewelry, yearbooks, motivation and recognition tools, and educational products. Jeff Webb was named President and COO in December 2012.\n\nVarsity Spirit requires a Safety Awareness class for all of its more than 350,000 cheerleading camp attendees and worked with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to require that all college programs are under the direction of a safety certified coach. For cheerleading safety, it partnered with the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators (AACCA), a nonprofit risk management organization that has certified more than 20,000 coaches from its founding, and is seen as the standard of cheerleading safety. AACCA was founded in 1987 with initial funding from Varsity Spirit.\n\nSince 2006, Varsity Spirit has provided safety audits for several of the NCAA Basketball Conference tournaments, including the Big 10 and others, to ensure the cheerleading squads are in compliance with safety requirements.\n\nThe NCAA's insurance company has only had a single catastrophic injury claim from cheerleading since 2006, when the NCAA partnered with Varsity and started requiring that coaches receive safety training like the AACCA course. Under the new safety program, both participant and coach training on technical cheerleading skills will emphasize learning in a progressive format, as well as on basic safety rules and limitations for games and practice. Training is provided at Varsity Spirit summer camps throughout the country.\n\nThe National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) developed a Spirit Coaches Education Program in 2007, and selected the AACCA Safety Course as the first course offering. Varsity Spirit's educational curriculum also provides technical training in the more advanced safety modules presented by the NFHS.\n\nIn 2009, AACCA and Varsity Spirit announced stricter safety standards for all competitions, which addressed the proper environment and equipment for cheerleading activity and clarified the requirements for spotters on the competition floor. In May 2010, AACCA released new safety guidelines for elementary, middle and junior high school teams. In 2011, Varsity Spirit covered the cost of the AACCA Safety Course for 200 coaches.\n\nIn March 2011, Varsity Spirit supported USA Cheer as it developed the USA Cheer Safety Council in partnership with the American Sports Medicine Institute (ASMI) in Birmingham, Alabama, founded by Dr. James Andrews, the renowned orthopedic surgeon.\n\nIn 2011, Varsity Spirit began \"Team Up for St. Jude,\" a fundraising campaign to support the children's research hospital. \"Team Up for St. Jude\" includes a letter writing campaign and Team Up for St. Jude Game Day events. As of January 2015, Varsity Spirit, through the Team Up for St. Jude Spirited by Varsity campaign, has contributed more than $2.6 million to St. Jude.\n\nThe Sparkle Effect is a nonprofit organization that generates cheerleading and dance programs including students with disabilities. Varsity Spirit partners with The Sparkle Effect to provide new cheerleading and dance uniforms to Sparkle Effect teams. As of 2015, Varsity has provided uniforms to 140 Sparkle Effect teams.\n\nCheeReaders was created by Hannah McRae Young to encourage children from kindergarten to second grade to pick up a book and read.\n\nVarsity Spirit created National School Spirit Day in 2009 to share stories and to encourage cheerleaders and dancers to participate in community service. National School Spirit Day was recognized on the floor of Congress in 2014. To date, cheerleaders and dancers have pledged more than 550,000 community service hours. In 2015, National School Spirit Day expanded to all of Varsity Brands, creating America's Most Spirited High School contest.\n\nIn 2016, Varsity Spirit took part in the Varsity Brands School Spirit Awards to honor schools, school groups and individuals who go the extra mile to build school pride, student engagement and community spirit.

The game is a prequel to the 2008 title \"White Knight Chronicles\", and was announced for Japan in the June 30, 2010 issue of \"Famitsu\" and was finally released on February 3, 2011. In Europe, the game was released on June 8 in most European countries, June 9 for Australia and New Zealand and June 10 for UK and Ireland. Unfortunately, there were no longer plans for a North American release.\n\n\"White Knight Chronicles: Origins\" signs the player character up to the Mobile Corps, a mercenary organization that operates via train. Traversing into the no-man's-land between Athwan and Yshrenia, whisking you into a thrilling world of shuddering battles between hulking warriors.\n\nRattling across the vast plains that separate two sworn foes is the special steam train that acts as your central hub. Through this hub you access missions as they become available, and spend earned Grace Points on new equipment.\n\nWhen the trusty Mobile Corps train rolls into a new, exotic location, you select a team of three skilled mercenaries to accompany you and stride out into the unknown. You can even add carriages to it to make room for new characters; plus, if you own White Knight Chronicles II on PlayStation 3, you can transfer data between the two games and receive special bonuses aboard the train.\n\nThe battle system used in White Knight Chronicles: Origin is a real-time system identical to its console counterpart, where the battle mode is initiated automatically when enemies are present.\n\nBefore a battle the player optionally goes into the \"Battle Preparation\" menu (accessible at any time) and chooses up to three sets of five commands for your in-game avatar.\n\nThis set of commands is called a \"Function Palette\" and several of these palettes can be saved, making tactical palette preparing and switching essential to the game. The commands can also be linked in order to create combos. These can then be used in battle. The player controls one of the characters while the others are controlled by the AI, as also seen in the previous games.\n\nThe main character possess the ability to transform into a mighty Optimus, a powerful warrior with heightened defences and a range of thunderous attacks. Along with teammates who can do the same, you form an impressive war machine capable of shredding even the fiercest beasts.\n\nAfter defeating an enemy, players will obtain raw materials. While this occurs in both the offline and online modes, some raw materials will only be obtainable in online quests. Materials are used for crafting, and upgrading, equipment and items.\n\n10,000 years before the original PS3 game takes place, there was a period of strife known as the Dogma Wars. This struggle is between the Yshrenian Empire who are harnessing the power of the Knights in a bid to conquer the world, and the Athwani Mage Kingdom who are trying to stop them. These events would shape history to come in the White Knight Chronicles saga, and White Knight Chronicles: Origins tells the story of the unsung heroes who lived through this period of unrest, only to be forgotten in the annals of time.\n"}
