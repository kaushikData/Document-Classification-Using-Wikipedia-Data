Since the name \"ALF\" was an acronym short for Alien Life Form and only given to Gordon Shumway later on Earth, \"ALF\" is never used in the animated series except for its title. ALF would always be referred to as \"Gordon\", his true name, or \"Gordo\" by his friends Rick and Skip. In nearly every episode a live action ALF would appear at the introduction and conclusion of the episode; reading fan mail and saying that this show is a response to a huge demand of people wanting to know what his life was like on Melmac.\n\nMuch of the humor arises from the characters taking part in surrealistic activities while treating them as ordinary and unremarkable. For example, in order to prove their manhood and win their distinguished antlers, the sons of members of the Mayonnaise Lodge (formed of men who work in the mayonnaise mines) must wrestle a clam and make it sing. Other episodes had issues somewhat similar to Earth issues, such as when Gordon's parents take part in a free vacation, while failing to realize it is a time share scam: the scam artist literally steals the Shumway residence and transplants it to the time share plots, then uses brainwashing machines to convince Flo and Bob to buy a house they already own.\n\nAnother one which was a play on the original TV series was a TV show which ALF and his family loved about \"the Earthling who crash landed on Melmac\" where a human was shown saying \"On my homeworld we keep cats as housepets\" and a Melmacian telling him \"Well, here we eat them!\" Gordon/ALF from this series is one of the cartoon characters featured in \"Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue\".\n\n\nOn May 30, 2006, Lionsgate Home Entertainment released both the first nine episodes of \"ALF: The Animated Series\" as \"ALF Animated Adventures – 20,000 Years in Driving School and Other Stories;\" and the first seven episodes of \"ALF Tales\" entitled \"ALF and The Beanstalk and Other Classic Fairy Tales\" on DVD in Region 1.\n\nCurrently, the Complete Series of both shows are available for viewing on Hulu Plus.\n\n\n"}

It is the second in the series released for the PlayStation Portable and the fourth for a portable platform. It is also the first game in the Ace Combat franchise to be set in the real world. The game was released on August 26, 2010 in Japan, on August 31, in North America, and in Europe on September 24.\n\nThe game features both a single-player mode as well as a multiplayer mode supporting \"ad hoc\" and Infrastructure mode. The game features a co-operative campaign which can be played with up to four players as well as a competitive multiplayer mode supporting up to eight players. Some missions in the campaign will make use of the Joint Assault Mission System, which breaks the players into teams and has them coordinate attacks where each effort can affect the other team's situation. A new feature of the game is the Enhanced Combat View mechanic, which removes the distanced fighting seen in almost every flight simulation game.\n\n\"Joint Assault\" features more than 40 licensed aircraft types, plus fictional aircraft from previous installments in the series, particularly \"\". Propeller planes will also be available for the first time in the series, with players being able to unlock the F6F-5 Hellcat and the A6M Zero. Frequent use of each aircraft allows the player to unlock more weapons, tune-up parts, paint schemes, and new emblems. The game's official superfighter is the GAF-1 \"Varcolac\".\n\nPlayers assume the role of a pilot freshly hired by a private military company called Martinez Security. The unnamed pilot is assigned to Antares Squadron under the command of Major Frederick Burford. Another squadron within the company, Rigel, has Milosz Sulejmani, Daniel Oruma, Faryd Gaviria, and Kiriakov. The game's antagonists are Col Nicolae Dumitrescu and international insurance businessman Andre Olivieri.\n\nThe game is set sometime after the global financial crisis. Off Midway Island, the player begins his first day on the job flying with Martinez Security in an exercise involving the US 7th Fleet and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. After a successful practice run, several unidentified bandits suddenly appear from the east and head due west. Burford breaks the news that the bandits, now known as the \"Valahia,\" are attacking Tokyo and the 7th Fleet is seeking Martinez Security's help. The defense of Tokyo is a success, with the destruction of the Valahia's Orgoi flying fortress and heavy damage being dealt to a larger airborne fortress called the Spiridus. Antares Squadron also helps the SDF fend off Valahia attacks at the Boso Peninsula and over the Izu Islands. In the midst of the action, the Rigel Squadron defects to the Valahia and leave Tokyo upon considering a lucrative offer by leader Col Nicolae Dumitrescu.\n\nEmbarrassed by the defection, Martinez Security joins the International Union Peacekeeping Force (IUPF) in stopping all Valahia activity around the world, starting with operations in the Middle East and the Balkans. During missions over Croatia and Serbia, the player fends off an attack from Rigel Squadron, now calling themselves the Varcolac Squadron. The crackdown is given an added boost when the IUPF destroys the Spiridus over London. Dimitrescu later announces that the Valahia have captured several former Soviet ballistic missile silos in Central Asia. As the IUPF prepares to attack the silos, Antares Squadron is hired to pilot Andre Olivieri's personal Boeing 747-200B over Valahia-controlled territory.\n\nAs Antares Squadron destroys the silos and eliminates the Valahia threat, the player discovers that Olivieri used his insurance earnings to finance the Valahia and the IUPF's operations, preparing for an operation named Golden Axe, scheduled to take place over San Francisco. It is revealed that the attacks themselves are part of a plan for Olivieri to establish a monopoly over the global insurance market. He also orders the Valahia eliminated because they went rogue on him with plans to establish a new nation. Antares Squadron, which reorganizes at Midway after the silo attack, is also attacked by the Golden Axe forces in an attempt to prevent them from stopping the operation.\n\nIn a final series of missions over Nevada and the Bay Area, Antares engages the rest of the Golden Axe forces and the Varcolac Squadron. After eliminating the Varcolac team, the player is sent to destroy Olivieri's underground data center at his company's headquarters in downtown San Francisco. The data center is destroyed, and Olivieri is killed in the blast, ending any further schemes of the Golden Axe Plan to foment more conflict. \n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of San Francisco, Olivieri's plans are exposed to the public, and the Antares Squadron continues to defend the skies.\n\nThe game was officially announced by Namco Bandai on January 12, 2010, however screenshots had been leaked a day before on IGN. The game officially went gold on August 13, 2010.\nReception to the game has been mixed. GameSpot and IGN stated that the game's story was not as dramatic as those from previous titles, and its saving grace is the co-operative play options and the easy access to new rewards. Gamesradar cited the PSP's control options as a letdown compared to console versions, but lauded the Joint Assault system as an idea worth seeing in future games, especially with \"Assault Horizon\". GameFan reviewer Christopher Bowen said the campaign was tedious and the online cooperative system is better off on the console versions. G4tv.com gave the game a 4/5 score.\n\n"}

It is the 5th game of the \"Anno\" series. It was released on 17 November 2011, and was co-developed by the German studios Related Designs and Blue Byte, and published by Ubisoft. \"Anno 2070\" requires Uplay to operate.\n\nThe scenario is set in the year 2070. Global warming has melted the Arctic ice cap, which has raised the global sea level so that the coasts were flooded. As a result, many old cities have vanished under the ocean, and much of what was once highland has been turned into chains of new islands. Responsibility for settling and exploiting these new frontiers is given to a select group of people, who captain mobile ocean-going bases known as Arks.\n\nThe game has three factions: The Eden Initiative (referred to as the \"Ecos\"), Global Trust (referred to as the \"Tycoons\"), and the S.A.A.T. (referred to as the \"Techs\"). Ecos are environmental and build sustainable cities, but are inefficient and slow to expand. Tycoons are industrious and expand quickly, but have problems with pollution and dwindling resources. The Tech is a support faction available to the other two, and they are useful in researching the latest and most powerful technologies. The Techs are only available later in the game when 10,000 credits are donated to their cause.\n\nIn \"Anno 2070\", politics are no longer defined by countries, boundaries, religions, races, etc., but how humans choose to produce energy. All humankind rally under one global government where the three main factions of the game control the world's decisions. Players can also vote for a World President and vote in Senate Council. Participation will give different effects to all players, depending on who is president or what bill was passed, until the next cycle of voting begins. For example, voting for the Tycoons' CEO Skylar Banes will increase productivity of manufacturing buildings.\n\nPlayers can also gain achievement and rewards from just playing the game. Players can customize their Ark to fit personal preference, which is only for aesthetics, as well as gaining special rewards that affect gameplay.\n\nResources and technology upgrades can be carried on Arks, and be used in another game in \"Continuous Mode\".\n\nThe gameplay includes \"World Events\"; special missions offered only for a limited time, allowing all players to band together and complete the missions. Completing missions will reward players depending on how many people participate.\n\n\nThere are also \"Current Events\", where a player can complete a particular quest for one of the three factions to gain rewards. Current Events change daily, unlike World Events, which can be around for several months.\n\n\nThe game contains Solidshield Tages SAS 3 machine activation limit.\n\nThe 3 machine activation limit has caused some criticism. Changing hardware can use up one activation. After the last activation is used, 1 is regained every 30 days.\n\nThe first DLC packs were announced on 13 February 2012.\n\nThree DLC packs were added 26 March 2012, these with a Tycoon theme in contrast to the previous Eco-themed DLCs.\n\nThree DLC packs were added with the new World Event The Nordamark Conflict.\n\nIn October 2012, Ubisoft published an expansion to the game called \"Deep Ocean\", which adds a new civilization level for the tech faction and new resources and products to satisfy that faction's new needs. It also offers a new energy source, the geothermal power plant, which may cause a new natural disaster: a tsunami. Five new campaign missions introduce these new features. It also adds many new factors to the game, which completely changes the way the game is played, most notably when playing with the Tech Faction.\n\nPlayers who don't have the Deep Ocean Expansion cannot play a multiplayer game with other players who do have the expansion unless the expansion is deactivated.\n\nCritical reception for \"Anno 2070\" has been positive since the game's release, with a majority of critics considering it a big step forward in the \"Anno\" series. Criticism of the game is heavily influenced by the requirement to be always online to access all game options. Without being online the player can still access an offline mode, but one can't edit their own profile information, and the player is unable to update their Ark base, place cargo into it, or upgrade it with equipment. Early reception at time of release was also negatively influenced by constant crashes, server issues, and critics pointed out that the game worked better on pirated versions instead of the official one with Ubisoft server access.\n"}

These usually have a different cast each week, but several series in the past, such as \"Four Star Playhouse\", employed a permanent troupe of character actors who would appear in a different drama each week. Some anthology series, such as \"Studio One\", began on radio and then expanded to television.\n\nMedieval Greek anthologiā, collection of epigrams, from Greek, flower gathering, from anthologein, to gather flowers : antho-, antho- + logos, a gathering (from legein, to gather; see leg- in Indo-European roots).\n\nMany popular old-time radio programs were anthology series. On some series, such as \"Inner Sanctum Mysteries\", the only constant was the host, who introduced and concluded each dramatic presentation. One of the earliest such programs was \"The Collier Hour\", broadcast on the NBC Blue Network from 1927 to 1932. As radio's first major dramatic anthology, it adapted stories and serials from \"Collier's Weekly\" in a calculated move to increase subscriptions and compete with \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Airing on the Wednesday prior to each week's distribution of the magazine, the program soon moved to Sundays in order to avoid spoilers with dramatizations of stories simultaneously appearing in the magazine.\n\nRadio drama anthology series include:\n\nRadio anthology series provided a format for science fiction, horror, suspense, and mystery genres (all produced in the USA, unless noted):\n\nThe final episode of \"Suspense\" was broadcast on September 30, 1962, a date that has traditionally been seen as marking the end of the old-time radio era. However, genre series produced since 1962 include:\n\nIn the history of television, live anthology dramas were especially popular during the Golden Age of Television of the 1950s with series such as \"The United States Steel Hour\" and \"The Philco Television Playhouse\".\n\nDick Powell came up with an idea for an anthology series, \"Four Star Playhouse\", with a rotation of established stars every week, four stars in all. The stars would own the studio and the program, as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz had done successfully with Desilu studio. Powell had intended for the program to feature himself, Charles Boyer, Joel McCrea, and Rosalind Russell. When Russell and McCrea backed out, David Niven came on board as the third star. The fourth star was initially a guest star. CBS liked the idea, and \"Four Star Playhouse\" made its debut in fall of 1952. It ran on alternate weeks only during the first season, alternating with \"Amos 'n' Andy\". It was successful enough to be renewed and became a weekly program from the second season until the end of its run in 1956. Ida Lupino was brought on board as the de facto fourth star, though unlike Powell, Boyer, and Niven, she owned no stock in the company.\n\nAmerican television networks would sometimes run summer anthology series which consisted of unsold television pilots. Beginning in 1971, the long-run \"Masterpiece Theatre\" drama anthology series brought British productions to American television.\n\nIn 2011, \"American Horror Story\" debuted a new type of anthology format in the U.S. Each season, rather than each episode, is a standalone story. Several actors have appeared in the various seasons, but playing different roles -- in an echo of the \"Four Star Playhouse\" format.\n\nThe success of \"American Horror Story\" has spawned other season-long anthologies such as \"American Crime Story\" and \"Feud\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the first and only game in the \"Cabbage Patch Kids Adventures\" series.\n\nMobyGames described the gameplay thus: \"Your player is a Cabbage Patch kid with pigtails who is having a day at the park. A day that includes jumping onto vines and leaping over holes and bouncing onto correct platforms. A misplaced jump will lose a life and additionally there are a few creatures such as bees who end the player's turn when touched.

The game is separated into several different screens (referred to in the game as scenes), each with a different obstacle for your kid to overcome. Obstacles include bouncing balls, water filled pits, floating platforms, bees, and even fires. Each level consists of ten scenes which must all be overcome before the time limit runs out. Along the way Anna may also collect various objects hidden in the trees (using well placed trampolines) for points, but these objects are not necessary to win\".\n\nIn the wake of the video game crash of 1983, this game served as \"Coleco's attempt to use one of their properties on the way up (Cabbage Patch Kids) to give a boost-through-association to one of their properties on the way down (the ColecoVision)\".

AtariProtos said \"While it may not be able to compare graphically to the Colecovision version, the Atari 2600 version of \"CPK\" is an amazing feat of programming. Not only was all the gameplay retained in this conversion, but it even included a cute little background tune which was a rarity in 2600 games.

{"id": "57006965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57006965", "title": "Chronicle of Rivius", "text": "Chronicle of Rivius\n\nThe Chronicle of Rivius is a German-language manuscript, often cited by Teodor Narbutt in his nine-volume work on the history of Lithuania and journal articles. Supposedly written between 1697 and 1730s by Jan Fryderyk Rivius, the chronicle remains unpublished. Lithuanian researcher Artūras Dubonis pointed out many inconsistencies in its authorship, unclear provenance, factual and chronological fallacies, and concluded that it is most likely a forgery, though more extensive study is required for a conclusive determination.\n\nAccording to Narbutt, he accidentally purchased the manuscript in Reval in 1808. He first made references to the chronicle in articles published in 1817. Narbutt did not cite page numbers of the chronicle in his work, though the pages are numbered and he cited the page numbers of the Bychowiec Chronicle. Narbutt prepared a Polish translation of the most important parts of the chronicle and intended to publish it in a collection of primary sources on the history of Lithuania. However, the chronicle remains unpublished and is kept, along with the Narbutt's translation, at the Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. \n\nThe chronicle is written in German with some phrases in Latin and words in Latvian. Narbutt analyzed the chronicle and claimed that it used an earlier Russian chronicle, compiled by Mitrofan, a monk in Pinsk. This work by Mitrofan was used both by Rivius and by Augustinus Rotundus for his long-lost history. Thus, according to Narbutt, the Chronicle of Rivius preserved some unique fragments of Rotundus' work. Narbutt lamented that fragments of Rotundus work, including two genealogical tables, were lost when the last pages of the manuscript burned during a fire at his library in 1838. However, the surviving manuscript shows no fire damage.\n\nThe chronicle contains many obviously wrong and incorrect facts. For example, it claims that in 1276 a woman gave birth to 346 babies or that Turks made an assault on Belgrade in 1717. The chronicle also contains many unique, otherwise unknown, facts from the history of Lithuania. For example, Lithuanian and Samogitian golden coins from the 13th century, a Lithuanian pagan flag with a cock on the tip of the pole, an inscription on the king Mindaugas tombstone, a description of the Perkūnas shrine in the Šventaragis' Valley in Vilnius. Some events are described differently in the chronicle than in Narbutt's works. For example, the chronicle records that Duke Mindaugas, his wife, and , Master of the Livonian Order, traveled to Rome in 1254 to discuss Mindaugas' coronation with the pope, while Narbutt described the trip in 1262 when Mindaugas traveled to clear his conscience of the apostasy and desire to serve pagan gods. In his comments to the translation, Narbutt even debated which version is more correct (though both are proved wrong by the 13th-century Livonian Rhymed Chronicle). \n\nNarbutt referred to the chronicle as \"Kronika niemiecka J. F. R.\" (German Chronicle of J. F. R.) and revealed its author to be Jan Fryderyk Rivius (1673–1730/1735), grandson of Johann Rivius (1528–1596). However, in his work Rivius provided his grandfather's biography that supplied no new information in addition to what was known from the encyclopedias of Johann Friedrich von Recke and Karl Eduard von Napiersky, published in 1831, and of , published in 1777. The biography also repeated some mistakes found int these encyclopedias. Also, the 77-year gap between grandfather's death and grandson's birth is virtually impossible. The chronicle makes no mention of Rivius' father or his own life, other than he was born in Königsberg and in 1689 moved to Courland, where he worked as a pastor after pastor Grott moved to Libau. The exact information about Grott was presented to Narbutt by Napiersky in a letter written in April 1833. Other researchers pointed out a Johannes Fridericus Ruvius from Wenden who became a student at the University of Dorpat in 1690, but Rivius was from Königsberg and it is unlikely that he \"forgot\" to mention his university education. Therefore, researcher Artūras Dubonis concluded that Rivius' biography was invented between 1833 and 1842.\n"}

{"id": "24674462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24674462", "title": "Dogme 95", "text": "Dogme 95\n\nDogme 95 was a filmmaking movement started in 1995 by the Danish directors Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, who created the \"Dogme 95 Manifesto\" and the \"Vows of Chastity\" (). These were rules to create filmmaking based on the traditional values of story, acting, and theme, and excluding the use of elaborate special effects or technology. It was an attempt to take back power for the director as artist, as opposed to the studio. They were later joined by fellow Danish directors Kristian Levring and Søren Kragh-Jacobsen, forming the Dogme 95 Collective or the Dogme Brethren. \"Dogme\" () is the Danish word for dogma.\n\nLars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg wrote and co-signed the manifesto and its companion \"vows\". Vinterberg said that they wrote the pieces in 45 minutes. The manifesto initially mimics the wording of François Truffaut's 1954 essay \"Une certaine tendance du cinéma français\" in \"Cahiers du cinéma\".\n\nThey announced the Dogme movement on March 13, 1995 in Paris, at \"Le cinéma vers son deuxième siècle\" conference. The cinema world had gathered to celebrate the first century of motion pictures and contemplate the uncertain future of commercial cinema. Called upon to speak about the future of film, Lars von Trier showered a bemused audience with red pamphlets announcing \"Dogme 95\".\n\nIn response to criticism, von Trier and Vinterberg have both stated that they just wanted to establish a new extreme: \"In a business of extremely high budgets, we figured we should balance the dynamic as much as possible.\"\n\nThe first of the Dogme films (Dogme #1) was Vinterberg's 1998 film \"Festen\" (\"The Celebration\"). It was critically acclaimed and won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival that year. Lars von Trier's Dogme film, \"Idioterne\" (\"The Idiots\"), also premiered at Cannes that year but was less successful. Since the two films were released, other directors have made films based on \"Dogme\" principles. French-American actor and director Jean-Marc Barr was the first non-Dane to direct a Dogme film: \"Lovers\" (1999) (Dogme #5). American director Harmony Korine's film \"Julien Donkey-Boy\" (Dogme #6) is also considered a Dogme film. In total, thirty-five films made between 1998 and 2005 are considered to be part of the movement.\n\nThe end credits of \"Het Zuiden\" (\"South\") (2004), directed by Martin Koolhoven, included thanks to \"Dogme 95\". Koolhoven originally planned to shoot it as a Dogme film, and it was co-produced by von Trier's Zentropa. Finally, the director decided he did not want to be so severely constrained as by Dogme principles.\n\nSince the late 2000s, the emergence of video technology in DSLR photography cameras, such as the Canon EOS 550D, has resulted in a tremendous surge of both feature and short films shot with most, if not all, of the rules pertaining to the Dogme 95 manifesto. However, because of advancements in technology and quality, the aesthetic of these productions typically appears drastically different from that of the Dogme films shot on Tape or DVD-R Camcorders. Largely erasing the primitive and problematic features of past technologies, newer technologies have helped Dogme 95 filmmakers achieve an aesthetic of higher resolution, as well as of lower contrast, film grain, and saturation.\n\nThe goal of the Dogme collective is to purify filmmaking by refusing expensive and spectacular special effects, post-production modifications and other technical gimmicks. The filmmakers concentrate on the story and the actors' performances. They believe this approach may better engage the audience, as they are not alienated or distracted by overproduction. To this end, Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg produced ten rules to which any Dogme film must conform. These rules, referred to as the \"Vow of Chastity,\" are as follows:\n\n\nThe above rules have been both circumvented and broken from the first Dogme film to be produced. For instance, Vinterberg \"confessed\" to having covered a window during the shooting of one scene in \"The Celebration\" (\"Festen\"). With this, he both brought a prop onto the set and used \"special lighting.\" Von Trier used background music (\"Le Cygne\" by Camille Saint-Saëns) in the film \"The Idiots\" (\"Idioterne\"). Korine's \"Julien Donkey-Boy\" features two scenes with non-diegetic music, several shot with non-handheld, hidden cameras and a non-diegetic prop. Von Trier, however, praised the film's transgressions on an interview released on the \"Epidemic\" DVD.\n\nLike the No Wave Cinema creative movement, Dogme 95 has been described as a defining period in low budget film production.\n\nSince 2002 and the 31st film, a filmmaker no longer needs to have his or her work verified by the original board to identify it as a Dogme 95 work. The founding \"brothers\" have begun working on new experimental projects and have been skeptical about the later common interpretation of the Manifesto as a brand or a genre. The movement broke up in 2005.\n\nA complete list of the 35 films is available from the Dogme95 web site.\n\nThe 2001 experimental film \"Hotel\", directed by Mike Figgis, makes several mentions of the Dogme 95 style of filmmaking, and has been described as a \"Dogme film-within-a-film\".\n\nThe use of 'Dogme 95' style filming is in a list of a hostage taker's demands in the \"Black Mirror\" episode, \"The National Anthem\".\n\nKeyboard player and music producer Money Mark used principles inspired by Dogme 95 to record his Mark's Keyboard Repair album.\n\nIn 2015, the Museum of Arts and Design celebrated the movement with the retrospective \"The Director Must Not Be Credited: 20 Years of Dogme 95\". The retrospective included work by Lars von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg, Jean-Marc Barr, Daniel H. Byun, Harmony Korine, Kristian Levring, Annette K. Olesen, and Lone Scherfig.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42535568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42535568", "title": "Edge sorting", "text": "Edge sorting\n\nEdge sorting is a technique used in advantage gambling where a player determines whether a face-down playing card is likely to be low or high at casino table games by observing, learning, and exploiting subtle unintentional differences on the backs of the cards being dealt.\n\nApplied by world-famous poker pro Phil Ivey and subsequently challenged in court by the casino in which he did so, the UK High Court ruled that the technique, which requires the player to trick the dealer into rotating specific, high-value cards, is cheating in civil law, and that a casino was justified in refusing payment of winnings. This ruling would not be applicable if the player simply took advantage of an observed error or anomaly in the deck for which he was not responsible.\n\nMany packs of cards produced by manufacturers have unintentional, almost indistinguishable edge irregularities. Typically the backs of every card in such a pack are identical, but the two long edges of each card are distinguishable from one another: the back pattern of one card is not symmetrical to another that has been rotated 180° (half a full turn).\n\nDuring the course of a game, the player asks the dealer to rotate high-value face-up cards, saying for example that they feel it will bring them luck. The dealer, indulging superstition, does not realize he or she is unwittingly orienting the cards such that valuable high cards are oriented one way in the deck and low cards the other way round. The unintentional card edge irregularity thus makes the high or low value of face-down cards apparent to an observer aware of how the dealer has been tricked into orienting them. This orientation will remain so long as the cards are not \"washed,\" shuffled in a way that rotates them. Thus, the player must also request that the dealer shuffle the cards with an automatic shuffler, which does not change the orientation as a manual shuffle might. The dealer is not obliged to comply with any of these requests, but will usually do so if thought to be the result of gambler superstition or mistrust.\n\nOver the course of a game being played this way, low cards will tend to be oriented one way, high cards the other. Once a significant proportion of cards have been rotated, any player who knows this can gain a statistical edge more than outweighing house edge by using the knowledge whether the card to be turned is likely to be low or high.\n\nCasinos usually regard this technique as cheating; many players consider that they are legitimately playing to gain an advantage.\n\nIn 2012 poker player Phil Ivey and partner Cheung Yin Sun won US$9.6 million playing baccarat at the Borgata casino. In April 2014 the Borgata filed a lawsuit against Ivey and Cheung for their winnings. In 2016 a Federal Judge ruled that Ivey and Cheung Yin Sun must repay US$10 million to the Borgata. U.S. District Judge Noel Hillman ruled that they did not commit fraud, but did breach their contract with the casino. He found that they did not abide by a New Jersey Casino Controls Act provision that prohibited marking cards. Although they did not mark the cards, they used tiny imperfections in the cards to gain an advantage.\n\nLater in 2012 he was reported to have won £7.7 million (approx. $11 million) playing punto banco, a version of baccarat, at Crockfords casino in London. Crockfords refunded his £1 million stake and agreed to send him his winnings, but ultimately refused payment. Ivey sued them for payment, but lost in the UK High Court; it was judged that the edge sorting was \"cheating for the purpose of civil law\". It was accepted that Ivey and others genuinely considered that edge sorting was not cheating, and deemed immaterial that the casino could easily have protected itself. Critically, the judgment pointed out that Ivey had gained an advantage by actively using a croupier as his innocent agent, rather than taking advantage of an error or anomaly on the casino's part. Ivey appealed against the judgement but was unsuccessful.\n\nHe further appealed to the UK Supreme Court which also decided in favour of the casino. All five justices upheld the decision of the court of appeal, \"which dismissed his case on the basis that dishonesty was not a necessary element of 'cheating'.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "50117569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50117569", "title": "Epistory", "text": "Epistory\n\nEpistory - Typing Chronicles is a 2016 action-adventure, typing video game by Fishing Cactus. The game was released on Steam Early Access in September 2015 and was officially released on March 30, 2016, for Linux, Microsoft Windows, and OS X. In the game, a young girl rides a fox with three tails. The game's story follows a writer's writing process, which unfolds like paper on-screen and is narrated from the perspective of the writer's internal thoughts.\n\nPart of the challenge in making Epistory was to \"feel like a game and not just a typing application\". To that end, the developers emphasised player choice in gameplay design decisions. The game was developed in Unity, using the Tiled map editor. The use of Tiled made the ground tiles look artificial, so this was fixed using Shader Forge. The EFJI keys were used to move the character through the world to encourage good use of the home keys. The art design was influenced by another game project that Fishing Cactus was working on, with a World War I theme. Because the frame story of Epistory is about a writer, it seemed like a natural choice to have a paper-themed world. Later, the decision was made to take it into 3D and incorporate papercraft and origami designs. Epistory used random methods to populate levels with trees, which were then manually checked and edited by the designers before being saved as the level.\n\nEpistory was released on Steam Early Access on 30 September 2015. Mac and Linux editions of Epistory were released on Steam Early Access in October 2015. Chapter Two was released in November 2015, and the price was increased to $12.99. Due to the popularity of the early access edition of the game, the deadline for release was pushed back to 2016 and more resources were devoted to the art design of the game, resulting in art assets that didn't match the earlier levels of the game. These were used in later levels to give the impression of the world becoming deeper as the player explores it. Epistory was available in English, French and German from the early access period, and Spanish was added later on. Mod support was added in June 2016, which allows players to change the words they typed in-game, add translations, and add support for different keyboard layouts.\n\nThe game was nominated for the Indie of the Year Awards at IndieDB. Had an honorable mention in the 17th Independent Games Festival's Excellence in Visual Art category.\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Multiple reviewers wrote in praise of its typing mechanics. Joshua Vanderwall, writing for the Escapist, described Epistory as a meditative experience. The game is a finalist for Best 3D Visuals at the Unity Awards 2016.\n\nThe game has been localized to 8 languages besides English: French, German, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese-Brazil, Russian, Czech (trans. Jan Balek) and Japanese. The localized versions have been in some cases marked as significantly more difficult, because all forementioned languages use alphabets with more characters than English, e.g. Spanish (29 without accents), Russian (33 letters), Czech (41/42 letters). Despite the higher difficulty the localized game is still accessible to younger audience.\n"}

The silent film follows the lives of a native Indonesian family sent into poverty by the husband's splurging. \"Eulis Atjih\" was a commercial success in the Indies, but failed in international markets.\n\nA native Indonesian man leaves his beautiful young wife Eulis Atjih and their child to lead a life of partying. She falls into poverty and, when he returns several years later, he is also poor.\n\n\"Eulis Atjih\" was produced by Java Film Co., which had made the first film in the Dutch East Indies, \"Loetoeng Kasaroeng\", in 1926. The earlier film had left Java Film Coy in a poor financial after it underperformed; as such, for \"Eulis Atjih\" the company had to find financial backers. The film was directed by G. Krugers and based on the novel by Joehana. The film featured native Indonesian actors, including Arsad and Soekria. It was a black and white, silent film.\n\n\"Eulis Atjih\" was the second film to include native Indonesians in its cast, and the second feature film produced in the country. The native role was emphasised in the film's promotion; a poster for a screening at the Orient Theatre in Surabaya, for example, wrote that the film's native cast was equal to any American or European one. Of note is the film's use of the word \"Indonesia\", which was not to be formalised as a preferred term for the archipelago until the Youth Pledge in 1928.\n\nThe Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that the film educated Dutchmen through its depiction of native Indonesian rites, including funerals and marriage, as well as sent a message to native audiences that splurging would only result in poverty.\n\n\"Eulis Atjih\" was released in 1927, being screened in Bandung in August and in Surabaya in September. It was a critical and commercial success in the country, especially among the ethnic Chinese community; the newspaper \"Pewarta Soerabaja\" wrote that the actress who played Eulis was \"beautiful when her life was carefree, but looked like a villager when she fell poor.\" In Surabaya, the film was accompanied by music from the \"keroncong\" group under Tuan Kayoon.\n\nFor international release, the Java Film Co. and Krugers emphasised the ethnographic aspects of the film. It was shown in Singapore, but was a commercial failure.\n\n"}

{"id": "4709336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4709336", "title": "Floating timeline", "text": "Floating timeline\n\nA floating timeline (also known as a sliding timescale) is a device used in fiction, particularly in comics and animation, to explain why characters age little or not at all over a period of time — despite real-world markers like notable events, people and technology appearing in the works and correlating with the real world. A floating timeline is a subtle form of retroactive continuity. This is seen most clearly in the case of comic book characters who debuted as teens in the 1940s or the 1960s but who are still relatively young in current comics. Events from the characters' pasts are alluded to, but they are changed from having taken place years ago to having taken place more recently.\n\nFor an example taken from television animation, in \"The Simpsons\", episode \"I Married Marge\", which was broadcast in 1991, Homer and Marge are shown in flashback to have conceived their son Bart in 1980, after watching \"The Empire Strikes Back\" in the cinema. In an episode that was broadcast in 2008, \"That '90s Show\", however, another flashback shows Homer and Marge in an earlier stage of their relationship, but sets those scenes in the mid- to late- 1990s. In both sets of present-day scenes, the characters are shown to be the same age—for example, Bart is still 10 years old in 1991 and 2008.\n\nFor comic book examples, any dates given within the comic are not relative to the publishing date of the comic (i.e. \"10 years ago\" means ten years before the reader read the story). This device enables publishing companies to continue to use their characters for as long as they wish without changing them significantly.\n\nA floating timeline is usually abstracted from that of actual historical events, but may contain subtle references to the real world timelines. There may also be attempts made to maintain certain characters' historic timelines if it is felt to be essential to the character's personality, while allowing the rest of the world's timelines to continue to develop. For example, in the 2000s comic book miniseries \"The Punisher\" and its subsequent continuation, the title character is shown to be a Vietnam War veteran, just as he was in his earliest appearances in the Marvel comics of the 1970s. However, the stories place him in contemporary New York, where he meets fellow Marvel characters such as Spider-Man, who is barely much older than he was when introduced in 1962. \n\nAn example taken from novels is the case of mystery writer Rex Stout, who created a floating timeline for master detective Nero Wolfe and other principal characters in the corpus, while the stories take place contemporaneously with their writing and depict a changing landscape and society. Nero Wolfe's age is 56. \"Those stories have ignored time for thirty-nine years,\" Stout told his authorized biographer John McAleer. \"Any reader who can't or won't do the same should skip them. I didn't age the characters because I didn't want to. That would have made it cumbersome and would seem to have centered attention on the characters rather than the stories.\" In the early novels, Wolfe dated himself somewhat by discussing his life before World War I and his combat service in that war, but in later stories he was less explicit about his past.\n\n"}
{"id": "880489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=880489", "title": "Gait (human)", "text": "Gait (human)\n\nHuman gait refers to locomotion achieved through the movement of human limbs. Human gait is defined as bipedal, biphasic forward propulsion of center of gravity of the human body, in which there are alternate sinuous movements of different segments of the body with least expenditure of energy. Different gait patterns are characterized by differences in limb-movement patterns, overall velocity, forces, kinetic and potential energy cycles, and changes in the contact with the surface (ground, floor, etc.). Human gaits are the various ways in which a human can move, either naturally or as a result of specialized training.\n\nHuman gaits are classified in various ways. Every gait can be generally categorized as either natural (one that humans use instinctively) or trained (a non-instinctive gait learned via training). Examples of the latter include hand walking and specialized gaits used in martial arts. Gaits can also be categorized according to whether the person remains in continuous contact with the ground.\n\nOne variable in gait is \"foot strike\" – how the foot contacts the ground, specifically which part of the foot first contacts the ground.\n\n\nIn sprinting, gait typically features a forefoot strike, but the heel does not contact the ground.\n\nSome researchers classify foot strike by the initial center of pressure; this is mostly applicable to shod running (running while wearing shoes). In this classification:\n\n\nFoot strike varies to some degree between strides, and between individuals. It varies significantly and notably between walking and running, and between wearing shoes (shod) and not wearing shoes (barefoot).\n\nTypically, barefoot walking features heel or midfoot strike, while barefoot running features midfoot or forefoot strike. Barefoot running rarely features heel strike because the impact can be painful, the human heel pad not absorbing much of the force of impact. By contrast, 75% of runners wearing modern running shoes heel strike, running shoes being characterized by a padded sole, stiff soles and arch support, and sloping down from a more padded heel to a less padded forefoot.\n\nThe cause of this change in gait in shoe running is unknown, but Liebermann noted that there is correlation between the foot-landing style and exposure to shoes. In some individuals, the gait pattern is largely unchanged – the leg position and foot position are identical in barefoot and shoe running – but the wedge shape of the padding moving the point of impact back from the forefoot to the midfoot. In other cases, it is conjectured that the padding of the heel softens the impact and resulting in runner modifying their gait to contact further back in the foot.\n\nA 2012 study involving Harvard University runners found that those who \"habitually rearfoot strike had approximately twice the rate of repetitive stress injuries than individuals who habitually forefoot strike\". This was the first study that investigated the link between foot strike and injury rates. However, earlier studies have shown that smaller collision forces were generated when running forefoot strike compared to rear-foot strike. This may protect the ankle joints and lower limbs from some of the impact-related injuries experienced by rear-foot strikers.\n\nIn a 2017 article called \"Foot Strike Pattern in Children During Shod-Unshod Running,\" there was a study done where over 700 children were observed from the ages of 6-16 to see their foot strike patterns and neutral support. They also wanted to see what outside factors to shod and unshod conditions and sex. This study used multiple video recording devices to get their results. The results showed that most foot patterns such as foot rotation and the rearfoot strike were similar in boys and girls at the same ages.\n\nThe CNS regulates gait in a highly-ordered fashion. The signals fire in a rhythmic fashion that matches the movement seen in behavior. This rhythmic firing is the result of Central Pattern Generators (CPG) that are present throughout the tracts. Regardless of if a motion is voluntary or not, these processes occur. Therefore, CPG’s are mostly autonomous to cognition.\n\nGait in humans is difficult to study due to ethical concerns. Therefore, the majority of what is known about gait in humans comes from fMRI data in different walking conditions. These studies have provided the field with several important discoveries.\n\nThere are numerous centers, both in the brain and in the spinal cord, that have been proposed to regulate gait. There are three centers that are specifically described to regulate locomotion:\n\n\nThese centers are coordinated with the posture control systems in place in the cerebral hemisphere and the cerebellum. With each behavioral movement, the sensory systems responsible for posture control respond. These signals act on the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. Many of these pathways are currently under investigation, but some aspects of this control are fairly well understood.\n\nFrom fMRI studies, two regions have been identified to hold particular importance in gait regulation. These are the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC.) When these regions are inhibited in bi-pedal monkeys, a close relative to humans, they experience irregular gait. In addition, the firing rate of these regions has been shown to regulate speed of gait. This suggestion is the result of a study showing that elderly have less activity in these regions, and this firing rate correlates with a slower gait. How these regions are regulated has yet to be fully elucidated, however they serve as current areas of research for disorders associated with irregular gait, such as Parkinson’s.\n\nThe cerebellum plays a major role in motor coordination. Regulation of gait by the cerebellum is referred to as “error/correction,” because the cerebellum responds to abnormalities in posture in order to coordinate proper movement. The cerebellum sends signals to the cerebral cortex and the brain stem in response to sensory signals received from the spinal cord. Efferent signals from these regions go to the spinal cord where motor neurons are activated to regulate gait.\n\nThere are multiple pathways within the spinal cord which play a role in regulating gait:\n\n\nThe so-called natural gaits, in increasing order of speed, are the walk, jog, skip, run, and sprint. While other intermediate speed gaits may occur naturally to some people, these five basic gaits occur naturally across almost all cultures. All natural gaits are designed to propel a person forward, but can also be adapted for lateral movement. As natural gaits all have the same purpose, they are mostly distinguished by when the leg muscles are used during the gait cycle.\n\nThe walk is a gait which keeps at least one foot in contact with the ground at all times.\n\nThe walk is performed with the following steps:\n\n1. Lift one leg off of the ground;\n\n2. Using the leg in contact with the ground, push your body forward;\n\n3. Swing your lifted leg forward until it is in front of your body;\n\n4. Fall forward to allow your lifted leg to contact the ground;\n\n5. Repeat steps 1–4 for the other leg;\n\n6. Repeat steps 1–5 to continue walking.\n\nSkipping is a gait children display when they are about four to five years old. While a jog is similar to a horse's trot, the skip is closer to the bipedal equivalent of a horse's canter.\n\nIn order to investigate the gait strategies likely to be favored at low gravity a series of predictive, computational simulations of gait are performed using a physiological model of the musculoskeletal system, without assuming any particular type of gait; a computationally efficient optimization strategy is utilized allowing for multiple simulations. The results reveal skipping as more efficient and less fatiguing than walking or running and suggest the existence of a walk-skip rather than a walk-run transition at low gravity.\n\nTime and distance parameters of gait patterns are dependent on a child's age. Different age leads to different step speed and timing. Arm swinging slows when the speed of walking is increased. Height of a child plays a significant role in stride distance and speed. The taller the child is the longer the stride will be and the further the step will be. Gait patterns are velocity and age dependent. For example, as age increased so did velocity. Meanwhile, as age increases, cadence (rate at which someone walks that is measured in steps per minute) of the gait pattern decreased. Physical attributes such as height, weight, and even head circumference can also play a role in gait patterns in children. Environmental and emotional status also play a role in with speed, velocity, and gait patterns that a child uses. Besides, children of different genders will have different rates of gait development. Significant developmental changes in gait parameters such as stride time, swing time, and cadence occur in a child’s gait two months after the onset of independent walking, possibly due to an increase in postural control at this point of development.\n\nBy the age of three, most children have mastered the basic principles of walking, consistent with that of adults. Age is not the only deciding factor in gait development. Gender differences have been seen in young children as early as three years old. Girls tend to have a more stable gait than boys between the ages of 3–6 years old. Another difference includes the plantar contact area. Girls showed a smaller contact area in plantar loading patterns than boys in children with healthy feet.\n\nThere are gender differences in human gait patterns: females tend to walk with smaller step width and more pelvic movement. Gait analysis generally takes gender into consideration. Gender differences in human gait can be explored using a demonstration created by the Biomotion Laboratory at Queen's University, Kingston, Canada.\n\nEven though plantigrade locomotion usually distributes more weight toward the end of the limb than digitigrade locomotion, which increases energy expenditure in most systems, studies have shown that the human heel-first gait conserves more energy over long distances than other gaits, which is consistent with the belief that humans are evolutionarily specialized for long-distance movement.\n\nFor the same distance, walking with a natural heel-first gait burns roughly 70% less energy than running. Differences of this magnitude are unusual in mammals. Kathyrn Knight of the \"Journal of Experimental Biology\" summarizes the findings of one study: \"Landing heel first also allows us to transfer more energy from one step to the next to improve our efficiency, while placing the foot flat on the ground reduces the forces around the ankle (generated by the ground pushing against us), which our muscles have to counteract.\" According to David Carrier of the University of Utah, who helped perform the study, \"Given the great distances hunter-gatherers travel, it is not surprising that humans are economical walkers.\"\n\nAbnormal gait is a result of one or more of these tracts being disturbed. This can happen developmentally or as the result of neurodegeneration. The most prominent example of gait irregularities due to developmental problems comes from studies of children on the autism spectrum. They have decreased muscle coordination, thus resulting in abnormalities in gait. Some of this is associated with decreased muscle tone, also known as hypotonia, which is also common in ASD. The most prominent example of abnormal gait as a result of neurodegeneration is Parkinson’s.\n\nAlthough these are the best understood examples of abnormal gait, there are other phenomenons that are described in the medical field.\n\n\nAbnormal gait can also be a result of a stroke. However, by using treadmill therapy to activate the cerebellum, abnormalities in gait can be improved.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "505243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505243", "title": "GamesMaster", "text": "GamesMaster\n\nGamesMaster is a British television show, screened on Channel 4 from 1992 to 1998, and was the first ever UK television show dedicated to computer and video games.\n\n\"GamesMaster\" began when Jane Hewland, formerly of LWT, who had set up her own production company Hewland International, took an interest in her son's love of video games. She put together a pitch for a show that would translate the excitement of games playing into watchable television. It was Channel 4 that became interested in the concept and green lit the production. However, because it had been pitched as a competitive event programme, the show was always under the jurisdiction of the \"sports\" department amongst shows such as \"Football Italia\", horse racing and Kabaddi.\n\nAlthough it featured game reviews, most of the show was about challenges where game players would compete against one another for the title of \"\"GamesMaster\" Champion\". Contestants who were successful at their challenges were rewarded with the coveted \"\"GamesMaster\" Golden Joystick\" trophy. Dominik Diamond usually presented the show with Sir Patrick Moore appearing in pre-recorded inserts as the 'Games Master'. During these challenges, Dominik was joined by a host of commentators. These included Derrick Lynch, Kirk Ewing, Julian Rignall, Rik Henderson, Dave Perry, Tim Boone and Neil West amongst others.\n\nFor the third series, Dexter Fletcher became the main presenter; this change was criticised by fans, who saw the new host as over-the-top, and too 'in-your-face'. To balance this, the production company dropped all other co-presenters and gave UK games champion Dave Perry a regular co-presenter slot on every show. Fletcher was better known at the time for having played an American character called \"Spike\" in the ITV drama series \"Press Gang\".\n\nFrom the very first episode, \"GamesMaster\" included reviews of forthcoming titles. In an attempt to give the show some authority and get the gaming press on their side, as well as eliminate the need for extra staff to review games, the reviews featured a host of magazines journalists from the publishing house EMAP. This meant the show could pool the collective opinions of magazines like \"Mean Machines\", \"C&VG\" and \"ACE\".\n\nHowever, by series 5, it was decided that the reviews would be better presented by two of the show's co-commentators, namely Rik Henderson and Dave Perry. It brought a much-needed stability to the format and some interesting banter between the reviewers. Series 6 also featured Rik, who was now joined by Ed Lomas, while series 7, due to time constraints and Dave Perry having resigned from the show's cast (after complaining on-air about being \"set up\" during a \"Super Mario 64\" challenge), employed two of its own research staff to present the slot, including Richard Pitt.\n\nPrior to \"GamesMaster\" appearing, games companies had very few TV shows on which to have their titles featured. UK broadcasters had shown sporadic interest in the scene, normally confining coverage to segments within Saturday morning children's programming. From time to time, news programmes would report on one of the very successful British games studios, but in contrast to programming involving films and music videos, there was no regular showcase for videogames.\n\n\"GamesMaster\" was first broadcast in 1992, during the fourth (16-bit) console generation - after the launch of the Mega Drive, but before the SNES. Sega's success in the early 90s (with both the Master System and Mega Drive, as well as the huge hit game Sonic the Hedgehog) helped cause a video game console boom in 1991, bringing gaming into mainstream UK culture, which would only increase following the arrival of consoles with 3D graphics such as those found on the PlayStation. That \"GamesMaster\" regularly drew in audiences in the millions proved that there was a huge and so far untapped audience.\n\nDespite competition with specialist gaming magazines, the show managed to secure several exclusives over the series, showing games that were months or even years away from being finished. Because \"GamesMaster\" was largely a challenge-based show, games studios could, for example, present a single level to be used for these competitive segments. \"Blast Corps\" is one example of a game that was demonstrated long before it, or even the Nintendo 64 that it played on, were released.\n\nOccasionally, games studios made levels specifically for use on one of the challenges. Shiny Entertainment were one such studio when they put together a special level of \"Earthworm Jim\". Though this worked out well for both game studio and the show, the experience was somewhat soured when this code ended up being leaked on the Internet. It is believed that the only way for this to have happened is that one of the staff on the show must have had links with online ROM crackers. It led to a great deal of embarrassment and likely upset the trust that existed between the producer, Shiny Entertainment and their publisher, Virgin Interactive.\n\n\nFor Series 2, the show began originally as in Series 1, except for it was \"plagued\" by numerous apparent \"technical faults\" (a ruse on the producer's part, the \"Please do not adjust your set\" warning that appeared is a hint to this), with the first challenge being an as yet un-shown \"Marble Madness\" challenge (the contestant's name and town are partly obscured over a technical fault, meaning this was also part of the joke). As the challenger was coming to the podium, the program \"crashed\", \"rebooted\" with the new series opener, and a \"Street Fighter II\" challenge, the cast acting like the short segment preceding the new challenge had not happened.\n\nEvery series following Series 2 had the original series' closing moments portrayed in the series itself as the previous \"set\" being deconstructed in some manner. In the final series, the set was literally dismantled and the studio closed down over Dominik's final words.\n\nEach location the series was set in, a plot device occurred after Auntie Marisha blew up the newly pine-fitted kitchen at the end of series 2, causing the oilrig to be evacuated. Dominik Diamond was later revealed to be burnt to death while trying to escape, giving way to Dexter Fletcher to present series 3, when in reality Diamond left the show. Diamond would later return in series 4 onwards in Hell and then in Heaven for series 5, continuing on from his whereabouts after his death in series 2 (although the opening title sequence of the fifth series offers an alternative \"death\", with Diamond being run over by a bus and flat-lining while in hospital). He then fell from Heaven in the opening credits to series 6 continuing a bit of continuity there, but that was dropped for the series 7 titles where Diamond traveled to the island setting of series 7 during a dream sequence.\n\nPrior to \"GamesMaster\" leaving UK television, there had been a crisis of confidence in games television over at rival channel ITV. Their children's department had commissioned another videogames show \"T.I.G.S.\" to accompany \"Bad Influence!\". Then, one series later, they pulled the plug on both shows, deciding that there was no demand for games coverage on their channel.\n\n\"GamesMaster\" was not affected and continued with success. In 1998, towards the end of production for the 7th series, the show was looking set to be re-commissioned; viewing figures were still strong, and the show was finding a new audience, benefiting from the emerging PlayStation culture with the success of Sony's console bringing gaming into the mainstream. The production was also more oriented towards actual games players than the first few series, which had been decidedly light in feature content, and no longer poked fun at 'nerds' and 'geeks', as it was young adults and not children and teenagers who appeared on the show; indeed, they and the publicity-seeking celebrities were now the subject of jokes.\n\nIt is believed that Dominik Diamond, along with the show's producers, wanted to make a more adult programme that would air in a late night, more mainstream time slot. (Series 8 was going to be set on a pirate ship with buxom wenches as the Golden Joystick assistants.) There was also talk of a spin-off show being made that would seek to emulate the US talk shows of the time. Whether this would have meant a programme that focused far less on games is unknown. No confirmation exists that any pilots of this concept were ever made; Channel 4 did not see the potential of a gaming show for an older, adult audience.\n\nHowever, changes in senior staff at Channel 4 were responsible for taking the show off the air. The new head of Channel 4 was Michael Jackson who had worked at LWT at the same time as Jane Hewland; the two never saw eye-to-eye. Alternatively, having been the head of BBC Two, Jackson may have wanted less entertainment programming on Channel 4.\n\nThe first series of the show was repeated on Challenge in 2003, but no further episodes have been shown. Challenge thought the show was \"too dated\" and \"the games being played wouldn't stand up today\".\n\nSeveral gaming shows were commissioned by Sky One in 1993 from Hewland International (one of which was \"Games World\"). Due to this close relationship with BSkyB, Hewland International were even successful in convincing them to launch a whole new channel dedicated to gaming, computers, the internet and technology. The Computer Channel launched in 1996 for only BSkyB subscribers, appearing for just two hours every night. Originally, the only gaming show was \"Game Over\", made by some of the same production team as \"Gamesmaster\" and \"Games World\". When The Computer Channel was relaunched as .tv in 1998, other shows began to start covering the gaming scene. These included \"Gear\", \"Roadtest\", \"ExMachina\" and also \"Games Republic\".\n\nThe latter show was closest in style and tone to \"Gamesmaster\", featured a themed studio set, studio challenges and the irreverent presenters Trevor and Simon. Though the show did not include any features or VT content, as it was a question based game show based on video games, it was produced by \"Gamesmaster\" and \"When Games Attack\" Producer Johnny Ffinch. The series unfortunately came under fire from fans after several questions asked in the show had incorrect answers, infuriating several contestants over the series. (For example, poorly researched questions about the Dreamcast's online capabilities, and characters from \"Tekken\").\n\nDominik Diamond returned to games television first as an interviewee in the 1999 documentary \"Games Wars\", in which he commented that boys getting turned on by Lara Croft was tragic and \"desperately sad\". He then returned to presenting in 2004 with a show on Bravo, called \"When Games Attack\". This programme was largely feature-based and contained plenty of Dominik's trademark humour. Prior to its broadcast, Dominik featured in a sizable \"Edge\" interview, with his longtime producer Johnny Ffinch. Both of them were quite vocal in stating their contempt for other shows about video games that were doing a bad job.\n\nThough it did also feature minor celebrity challenges (mainly football players and glamour models), there were never any head-to-head competitions. To date, Bravo has yet to show a second series. However, in November 2007, a repeat of the only series to date was aired.\n\nIn 1999, the BBC filmed two pilot episodes of a new TV show franchise dedicated to video games titled \"Bleeding Thumbs\" - with Gamesmaster's Rik Henderson as assistant producer and initial commentator. The series would have run between 1999 and 2000 alternating with the hugely successful \"Robot Wars\", hoping to emulate the success \"GamesMaster\" achieved in the process. Two pilots were filmed and were hosted by Dermot O'Leary and Kate Thornton, and then Terry Alderton accompanying Thornton, the commissioning editor decommissioned the show claiming that \"People want to play games, not watch them\".\n\n\"GamesMaster\" was also the first UK show to feature the sport of robot fighting in a news item, which at the time was on Local Public-access television in the US. Hewland International worked for several years to translate the sport into something for UK viewers. Though they never succeeded, another production company, Mentorn, were able to get their show concept \"Robot Wars\" picked up by BBC Two.\n\nIn 1993, Future Publishing began a tie-in magazine, also called GamesMaster, which as of today is still published, (unlike the official website for the show which shut down a few weeks after the show ended) headed up by its editor-in-chief Robin Alway. In the May issue of 2010, Alway announced that Future Publishing were 'looking into' reintroducing the programme to British television, and promised that he would keep the readers of the magazine informed of any future details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "409830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=409830", "title": "History of dance", "text": "History of dance\n\nThe history of dance is difficult to access because dance does not often leave behind clearly identifiable physical artifacts that last over millennia, such as stone tools, hunting implements or cave paintings. It is not possible to identify with exact precision when dance became part of human culture.\n\nDance has been an important part of ceremony, rituals, celebrations and entertainment since before the birth of the earliest human civilizations. Archaeology delivers traces of dance from prehistoric times such as the 30,000-year-old Bhimbetka rock shelters paintings in India and Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures from c. 3300 BC. Many contemporary dance forms can be traced back to historical, traditional, ceremonial, and ethnic dances of the ancient period.\n\nDance may have been used as a tool of social interaction that promoted cooperation essential for survival among early humans. Studies found that today's best dancers share two specific genes associated with a predisposition for being good social communicators.\n\nMany dances of the early periods were performed to celebrate festivals, on important or seasonal occasions such as crop harvest, or births and weddings. Such dances are found all over the world.\n\nDance may be performed in religious or shamanic rituals, for example in rain dance performed in times of drought. Shamans dancing for rain is mentioned in ancient Chinese texts. Dance is an important aspect of some religious rites in ancient Egypt, similarly dance is also integral to many ceremonies and rites among African people. Ritual dances may also be performed in temples and during religious festivals, for example the Rasa ritual dances of India (a number of Indian classical dances may have their origin in ritual dances), and the Cham dances of Tibet.\n\nAnother early use of dance may have been as a precursor to ecstatic trance states in healing rituals. Dance is used for this purpose by many cultures from the Brazilian rainforest to the Kalahari Desert. Medieval European \"danses macabres\" were thought to have protected participants from disease; however; the hysteria and duration of these dances sometimes led to death due to exhaustion.\n\nAccording to a Sinhalese legend, Kandyan dances originated 2500 years ago, from a magic dance ritual that broke the spell on a bewitched king to cure the king of a mysterious illness.\n\nOne of the earliest structured uses of dances may have been in the performance and in the telling of myths. It was also sometimes used to show feelings for one of the opposite gender. It is also linked to the origin of \"love making.\" Before the production of written languages, dance was one of the methods of passing these stories down from generation to generation.\n\nIn European culture, one of the earliest records of dancing is by Homer, whose \"Iliad\" describes chorea (χορεία \"khoreia\"). The early Greeks made the art of dancing into a system, expressive of all the different passions. For example, the dance of the Furies, so represented, would create complete terror among those who witnessed them. The Greek philosopher, Aristotle, ranked dancing with poetry, and said that certain dancers, with rhythm applied to gesture, could express manners, passions, and actions. The most eminent Greek sculptors studied the attitude of the dancers for their art of imitating the passion.\n\nAn early manuscript describing dance is the \"Natya Shastra\" on which is based the modern interpretation of classical Indian dance (e.g. Bharathanatyam).\n\nDuring the reign of the last Mughals and Nawabs of Oudh dance fell down to the status of 'nautch', an unethical sensuous thing of courtesans.\n\nLater, linking dance with immoral trafficking and prostitution, British rule prohibited public performance of dance. Many disapproved it. In 1947, India won her freedom and for dance an ambience where it could regain its past glory. Classical forms and regional distinctions were re-discovered, ethnic specialties were honored and by synthesizing them with the individual talents of the masters in the line and fresh innovations emerged dance with a new face but with classicism of the past.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the ancient Sinhalese chronicle \"Mahavamsa\" states that when King Vijaya landed in Sri Lanka in 543 BCE he heard sounds of music and dancing from a wedding ceremony. The origins of the dances of Sri Lanka are dated back to the aboriginal tribes, and to the mythological times of aboriginal yingyang twins and \"yakkas\" (devils). The classical dances of Sri Lanka (Kandyan dances) feature a highly developed system of tala (rhythm), provided by cymbals called thalampataa.\n\nThere is a long recorded history of Chinese dances. Some of the dances mentioned in ancient texts, such as dancing with sleeve movements are still performed today. Some of the early dances were associated with shamanic rituals. Folk dances of the early period were also developed into court dances. The important dances of the ancient period were the ceremonial \"yayue\" dated to the Zhou dynasty of the first millennium BC. The art of dance in China reached its peak during the Tang dynasty, a period when dances from many parts of the world also performed at the imperial court. However, Chinese opera became popular during the Song and Yuan dynasty, and many dances were merged into Chinese opera. The art of dance also declined from the Song dynasty onward as a result of the increasing popularity of footbinding, a practice that ironically may have originated from dancing when a dancer wrapped her feet so she may dance ballet-fashion. The best-known of the Chinese traditional dances are the dragon dance and lion dance. Lion dance was described in the Tang dynasty in form that resembles today's dance.\n\nThe origins of ballet dancing can be traced to the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century. Dance masters would teach the steps to nobility and the court would participate in performances as a form of social entertainment. This practice continued for several centuries. In the 17th century, courtly ballet reached its peak under the rule of King Louis XIV. \n\nBy the 18th century, ballet had migrated from the French and Italian royal courts to the Paris Opéra under the careful direction of composer/dancer Jean-Baptiste Lully. Lully sought to develop ballet into a more serious art. Under his influence, ballet was turned into a recognized art that was performed by professional dancers rather than courtiers. \n\nDuring the 18th century, ballet transitioned from a courtly dance of moving images as spectacle to a performance art in its own right. Ballet performances developed around a central narrative and contained expressive movement that revealed the relationships between characters. This dramatic style of ballet became known as the ballet d' action. The ballet d' action strove to express, for the first time, human emotions drawn directly from the dancers themselves. Masks previously worn by performers were removed so that emotional content could be derived from facial expressions. \n\nCostumes during this time were very restricting for dancers. Although a more expressive use of the body was encouraged, dancers' movements were still restricted due to heavy materials and corseted dresses. Costumes often covered a dancer's physique and made it difficult to see complex or intricate choreography. It was not until choreographer Jean Georges Noverre called for dance reforms in 1760 with his \"Letters on Dancing and Ballets\" that costumes became more conducive. Noverre urged that costumes be crafted using lightweight fabrics that move fluidly with the body, complimenting a dancer's figure. In addition, dancers wore soft slippers that fit snuggly along the foot. This shoe design instilled confidence within the ballerina, daring her to dance on her toes. Naturalistic costuming allowed dancers to push the boundaries of movement, eventually rising en pointe.\n\nThe era of Romanticism produced ballets inspired by fantasy, mystique, and the unfamiliar cultures of exotic places. Ballets that focused more on the emotions, the fantasy and the spiritual worlds, heralded the beginning of true pointe-work. Now, on her toes, the deified ballerina (embodied in this period by the legendary ballerina Marie Taglioni) seemed to magically skim the surface of the stage, an ethereal being never quite touching the ground. It was during this period that the ascending star of the ballerina quite eclipsed the presence of the poor male dancer, who was in many cases reduced to the status of a moving statue, present only in order to lift the ballerina. This sad state was really only redressed by the rise of the male ballet star Vaslav Nijinsky, with the Ballets Russes, in the early 20th century. Ballet as we know it had well and truly evolved by this time, with all the familiar conventions of costume, choreographic form, plot, pomp, and circumstance firmly fixed in place.\n\nSince the Ballets Russes began revolutionizing ballet in the early 20th century, there have been continued attempts to break the mold of classical ballet. Currently the artistic scope of ballet technique (and its accompanying music, jumper, and multimedia) is more all-encompassing than ever. The boundaries that classify a work of classical ballet are constantly being stretched, muddied and blurred until perhaps all that remains today are traces of technique idioms such as turnout.\n\nIt was during the explosion of new thinking and exploration in the early 20th century that dance artists began to appreciate the qualities of the individual, the necessities of ritual and religion, the primitive, the expressive and the emotional. In this atmosphere modern dance began an explosion of growth. There was suddenly a new freedom in what was considered acceptable, what was considered art, and what people wanted to create. All kinds of other things were suddenly valued as much as, or beyond, the costumes and tricks of the ballet.\n\nMost of the early 20th century modern choreographers and dancers saw ballet in the most negative light. Isadora Duncan thought it most ugly, nothing more than meaningless gymnastics. Martha Graham saw it as European and Imperialistic, having nothing to do with the modern American people. Merce Cunningham, while using some of the foundations of the ballet technique in his teaching, approached choreography and performance from a totally radical standpoint compared to the traditional balletic format.\n\nThe 20th century was indeed a period of breaking away from everything that ballet stood for. It was a time of unprecedented creative growth, for dancers and choreographers. It was also a time of shock, surprise and broadening of minds for the public, in terms of their definitions of what dance was. It was a revolution in the truest sense.\n\nAfter the explosion of modern dance in the early 20th century, the 1960s saw the growth of postmodernism. Postmodernism veered towards simplicity, the beauty of small things, the beauty of untrained body, and unsophisticated movement. The famous \"No\" manifesto rejecting all costumes, stories and outer trappings in favour of raw and unpolished movement was perhaps the extreme of this wave of thinking. Unfortunately lack of costumes, stories and outer trappings do not make a good dance show, and it was not long before sets, décor and shock value re-entered the vocabulary of modern choreographers.\n\nBy the 1980s dance had come full circle and modern dance (or, by this time, \"contemporary dance\") was clearly still a highly technical and political vehicle for many practitioners. Existing alongside classical ballet, the two art-forms were by now living peacefully next door to one another with little of the rivalry and antipathy of previous eras. In a cleverly designed comment on this ongoing rivalry the brilliant collaboration of Twyla Tharp (one of the 20th Century's cutting edge Dance avant-gardist/contemporary) and Ballet dance was ultimately achieved. The present time sees us still in the very competitive artistic atmosphere where choreographers compete to produce the most shocking work, however, there are still glimpses of beauty to be had, and much incredible dancing in an age where dance technique has progressed further in expertise, strength and flexibility than ever before in history.\n\nAt the same time, mass culture experienced expansion of street dance. In 1973, famous group Jackson 5 performed on television a dance called \"Robot\" (choreographed by postmodern artist Michael Jackson) a dance form cultivated in Richmond, CA. This event and later Soul Train performances by black dancers (such as Don Cambell) ignited a street culture revolution, in a sense. Bboying in New York, Locking in L.A., Poping in Fresno, CA, Boogaloo in Oakland, CA, Robot in Richmond, CA, all had their own creative explosions happen around the late 60's - 70's. Each with their own histories, practices, innovators and foundations. \n\nFor the emergence of 20th century modern dance see also: Mary Wigman, Gret Palucca, Harald Kreutzberg, Yvonne Georgi, and Isadora Duncan.\n\nHip-hop dance started when Clive Campbell, aka Kool DJ Herc and the father of hip-hop, came to New York from Jamaica in 1967. Toting the seeds of reggae from his homeland, he is credited with being the first DJ to use two turntables and identical copies of the same record to create his jams. But it was his extension of the breaks in these songs—the musical section where the percussive beats were most aggressive—that allowed him to create and name a culture of break boys and break girls who laid it down when the breaks came up. Briefly termed b-boys and b-girls, these dancers founded breakdancing, which is now a cornerstone of hip-hop dance.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1487695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1487695", "title": "Keys to Ascension 2", "text": "Keys to Ascension 2\n\nKeys to Ascension 2 is the fifth live and sixteenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Yes. It was released as a double album in November 1997 by Essential Records as the successor to the previous live/studio album \"Keys to Ascension\". After guitarist Steve Howe and keyboardist Rick Wakeman returned to the band in 1995, the group relocated to San Luis Obispo, California and started to write new material. The reunion of this particular line-up was promoted with three concerts at the city's Fremont Theater in March 1996, the five's first live performance together since 1979. \"Keys to Ascension 2\" features the remaining half of the live set from the 1996 shows and two studio new tracks which marked a return to the group writing long-form songs.\n\n\"Keys to Ascension\" received mixed reviews from music critics. It reached No. 62 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 169 on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States. A promotional North American tour was scheduled to start in June 1997, but it was cancelled after Wakeman had already been booked for other projects which led to his departure from the band. The studio material from the \"Keys to Ascension\" albums was compiled on \"Keystudio\" (2001), and both albums were reissued in their entirety in 1998 and 2010, the latter with the concert video as a bonus disc.\n\nIn mid-1995, guitarist Steve Howe and keyboardist Rick Wakeman returned to the group which had also comprised lead vocalist Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, and drummer Alan White. The five assembled in San Luis Obispo, California to rehearse and record new studio material which included concerts at the city's Fremont Theater from 4–6 March 1996, the first live performance of this particular line-up since 1979. The first half of their live set from the 1996 shows, plus two new studio tracks, were released as \"Keys to Ascension\" in October 1996 by Essential Records.\n\nBy the time \"Keys to Ascension\" was released, the label had expressed a wish for the group to put out roughly 45 minutes of new studio material with the remaining unreleased live tracks from the 1996 concerts as a second instalment of the \"Keys to Ascension\" series. The band agreed, and had a deadline to hand over the finished album by the end of November 1996 in exchange for a sum of money from the label that Christmas. Wakeman was \"heavily against\" the album's title due to his excitement over the quality of the new songs that Yes had recorded which he thought deserved to be released as a separate album.\n\nDisc one contains the remaining unreleased live tracks from the three shows at the Fremont Theatre in March 1996. This includes material from \"Time and a Word\" (1970), \"The Yes Album\" (1971), \"Close to the Edge\" (1972), and \"Going for the One\" (1977).\n\nDisc two contains five studio tracks that were recorded in the course of a year from the fall of 1995. After promoting \"Keys to Ascension\" the group finalised the arrangements mainly from ideas that Anderson, Squire, and White had already put down and recorded the songs in November 1996. The band leased a building in San Luis Obispo that was once a bank and set up a recording studio inside that was later dubbed Yesworld Studio on the album's sleeve notes. Working with the band was Tom Fletcher, who was only available to oversee production of the live tracks as he commitments with Steve Lukather. This prompted Squire to suggest Billy Sherwood, who had played additional guitars during Yes's 1994 tour, to complete production on the studio material and additional recording, engineering, and mixing. This was the first time Wakeman had worked with Sherwood, and the keyboardist praised Sherwood's attitude and contributions to the album. Wakeman was particularly pleased with the studio tracks on \"Keys to Ascension 2\", rating them \"light years\" ahead of the studio material on its predecessor. He reasoned this down to the sense of maturity in the songs and the greater amount of input from the band in terms of what they and other members played, something that had not been done for a long time.\n\n\"Mind Drive\" was originally a song that was rehearsed by the proposed supergroup XYZ featuring Squire, White, and guitarist Jimmy Page. \"Children of the Light\" was originally written by Jon and Vangelis in 1986 as \"Distant Thunder\". A demo version was recorded by Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe which was included as a hidden track on the 2011 reissue of \"Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe\" (1989). The lyrics to the song was printed on the band's 1991 tour book. The original version of \"Children of the Light\" included a keyboard introduction written by Wakeman entitled \"Lightning\", but it was removed prior to the album's release. In 1998, Howe said that the introduction was taken off following the group's overall dissatisfaction with it, an opinion that the record company also shared. The section was restored on the 2001 compilation album \"Keystudio\", which combined the studio tracks from both \"Keys to Ascension\" albums. The version of \"Children of the Light\" on the compilation, however, has a verse removed.\n\nAs with its predecessor, \"Keys to Ascension 2\" features cover art by Roger Dean on an outer sleeve that fits around the package. On the sleeve, the image's predominant colour is magenta, but the booklet features the painting in its original blue colouration. \n\nThe studio tracks from this album and \"Keys to Ascension\" were be rereleased on \"Keystudio\". The whole album was reissued in 2010 along with its earlier companion album \"Keys to Ascension\" and the concert video of the same name as part of the \"Keys to Ascension\" box set.\n\nCredits are adapted from the album's 1997 liner notes.\n\nYes\n\nProduction\n"}

Sometimes taking place in a separate continuity or more loose continuity (such as Vertigo by DC Comics) or exploring a kind of subject matter and or genre which the publisher does not want to involve in their main franchise or so called \"universe\". Often lines which explore more \"realistic\" or \"dark\" subject matters are published under a companies sub imprints (such as Ultimate Marvel or MAX by Marvel Comics) to distinguish it from their main superhero lines. Sometimes a line can be published under an imprint but not always be part of a larger continuity within their imprint (such as \"The Punisher\" MAX line which is not in continuity with most other Marvel Max titles). A line can consist of several different titles, ongoing series, limited series, one-shots, annuals, specials or trades and be by many different artists but are advertised and marketed as part of the line. So called crossover events are often followed by a line of tie-in comics to the event miniseries from other unrelated titles to connect them. \n\nDark Horse Comics has several lines which focuses on their licensed film properties such as \"Alien\", \"Predator\" and \"Star Wars\". The \"Aliens\" line consists only of limited series, one-shots and graphic novels due to the publishers wish to allow artistic freedom. Dark Horse's \"Star Wars\" line was ended in 2014 due to Disney moving their \"Star Wars\" comics to Marvel. Dark Horse also publishes a line of comics which are creator owned but are connected through common oversight by editor Karen Berger. Most companies have several simultaneously running lines.\n"}

{"id": "10287348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10287348", "title": "Live Audio Wrestling", "text": "Live Audio Wrestling\n\nLive Audio Wrestling (also known as The LAW) was a Canadian sports radio talk show hosted by \"The Mouth\" Dan Lovranski and Jason Agnew. The program primarily covered news and events surrounding professional wrestling (such as WWE) and mixed martial arts. First premiering in May 1997 as an internet radio show, \"The LAW\" later shifted to conventional radio on several stations in the Toronto area, and moved to CHUM in 2011, where it remained until its cancellation on October 30, 2017.\n\nA new video podcast series, also called \"Live Audio Wrestling\", is set to air as part of Impact Wrestling's Twitch platform. Most of the shows making up the original \"Live Audio Wrestling\" have since migrated to a new website, known as \"Post Wrestling\".\n\n\"Live Audio Wrestling\" started on May 23, 1997, as an internet radio show through \"Virtually Canadian\". The first guest of \"The LAW\" was Faarooq. The show aired online for a year and a half before moving to CJCL, \"The Fan 590\"however, it was still only broadcast online, since the show was broadcast as replacement programming due to NBA policies prohibiting the station's online feed from airing Toronto Raptors games. In an effort to obtain studio time, the show would be taped early in the morning. Due to popular demand and viewer support, \"The LAW\" soon became part of \"The Fan\"'s normal lineup, airing in the early afternoon on Saturdays. The show later expanded to include a two-hour late-night program on Sunday nights from 1:00 to 3:00 a.m., later moved to Saturdays at 11:00 p.m. in late 1999, while the afternoon edition moved to 5:00 p.m. In February 1999, Dave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" began a weekly segment during the program.\n\n\"The LAW\" aired on The Fan 590 until September 2000 when it moved to rival station CFYI Talk 640 as a companion to the station's recently acquired radio broadcasts of Toronto Maple Leafs games. The evening broadcast was moved from Saturdays to Sundays. In April 2001, the afternoon edition of \"The LAW\" was dropped during the station's re-launch under the Mojo Radio format, while \"The LAW\" remained on the station through 2006\n\nIn January 2005, Fight Network purchased a majority stake in \"The LAW\" and in February of that same year they announced that they had secured an agreement with Broadcast News for national distribution the program, via Fight Network Radio.\n\nDuring the CFYI and CFRB era, \"The LAW\" was also syndicated to several other radio stations in Canada through a network known as \"Fight Network Radio\". Former affiliates of the group (aside from its flagship Toronto stations) included:\n\n\nIn July 2006, \"The LAW\" moved to CFRB and retained its 11pm time-slot. In the fall of 2006, Live Audio Wrestling announced that in the future, the show would begin to air a simulcast of the show on Fight Network, however the announcement never came to fruition.\n\nThe show is ranked No. 1 in the demographic of male, on talk radio in the Toronto market, in its time slot. In April 2006, The Bureau of Broadcast Measurement released their spring ratings with The LAW ranking No. 1 among Males 25 - 49 on Sunday nights with an 18.7 share and also scoring a 17.8 share among Males 18 – 34.\n\nStarting in the winter of 2007, John Pollock began to host an extended, online edition of \"The LAW\" called \"Live Audio Xtra\". The segment is available to those who listen to the archived edition of the show on \"The LAW\" website, as an add-on to the original radio production. Shortly after its launch, Dan Lovranski began to co-host the segment, answering e-mail questions. Starting with the January 20th 2008 edition, \"Live Audio Xtra\" began to take call-in questions from listeners who were unable to get on the air during the radio portion of the program. This segment of the show was discontinued for a brief period of time, but returned to The LAW in 2011.\n\n\"The LAW\" aired its final edition on CFRB on January 11, 2009, moving to the Sirius Satellite Radio channel Hardcore Sports Radio (later known as The Score Satellite Radio), maintaining its Sunday night timeslot, and still being produced from CFRB's studios. Despite no longer being aired on conventional radio, the program was still billed as being a part of \"Fight Network Radio\". After the closure of The Score Satellite Radio in August 2011, \"The LAW\" briefly became a podcast on the Fight Network website, using the same format as the radio versions (but without call-in segments).\n\nOn October 9, 2011, \"The LAW\" moved to CHUM; while the program maintained its traditional 11:00 p.m. timeslot, it is preempted by \"Sunday Night Football\" during the NFL season.\n\n\"The LAW\" began airing on CHUM's sister station CFTE in Vancouver on September 9, 2012. \"The LAW\" currently does not air on any other TSN Radio station.\n\nOn the morning of October 30, 2017, the LAW issued a statement:\n\nThis announcement came just fourteen hours after the October 29 edition of The LAW was made available for podcasting. Many fans were caught off guard as the hosts had signed off planning for a big show for the next week, including a returning John Pollock reviewing Impact Bound For Glory and UFC 217: Bisping vs. St-Pierre.\n\nIt was reported on the Wrestling Observer / Figure Four Online website in Dave Meltzer's October 30 Daily Update that;\n\nOn the October 31 edition of Wrestling Observer Radio Meltzer also stated \"The amount of money that they're (Anthem) losing on Impact, has led to them doing cuts on the Fight Network\" and \"All the particulars (Presenters) that were on the show you know, are going to be gone.\" He went on to speculate that The LAW may be turned into a \"Impact promotional show\".\n\nMany of the LAW hosts including those from the associated podcasts received overwhelming support from their fans on Twitter, including Jason Agnew, John Pollock, Wai Ting, Braden Herrington, \"Bartender\" Dave, Brian Mann, and Nate Milton, while Chris Charlton, WH Park, Martian Bushby, and Richard Benson publicly thanked The LAW & John Pollock for their opportunities with \"Japanese Audio Wrestling\" and \"British Audio Wrestling\" respectively. Oli Court of \"British Audio Wrestling\" hinted \"it's not the end of anything just yet!\" and Jojo Remy of \"Japanese Audio Wrestling\" stated \"Not sure what this means for my show. I’ll continue to be a strong presence at Voices of Wrestling.\"\n\nStarting with the day after the shutdown of the LAW, John Pollock and Wai Ting continued to post audio reviews of \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\", under the temporary titles of \"John Pollock and Wai Ting Review Raw\" and \"John Pollock and Wai Ting Review SmackDown\", respectively. On their first episode as independent podcasters, both hosts (Pollock had been one of Fight Network's longest-tenured employees, and, at the time of their release, one of the few remaining full-time journalists) discussed the news of being released from Fight Network (also stating that Dan \"The Mouth\" Lovranski and Jason Agnew were released), thanking their fans for all the support they received, their plans for their \"future endeavours\", alongside the review of \"Raw\".\n\nIn January 2018, Impact Wrestling announced that a new show with the \"Live Audio Wrestling\" name will air as part of its Twitch channel, as a video podcast hosted by Jeremy Borash, though as of April 2018 it has yet to air, owing to Borash's subsequent departure. Aside from the name, it has no connection to the original show.\nThe spiritual successor of \"Live Audio Wrestling\" in its original form, titled \"POST Wrestling\" and run in its entirety by John Pollock and Wai Ting (the name is an abbreviation of \"Pollock Offsets Ting\"), was announced on December 15, 2017, and launched on December 24, 2017, with their Christmas show that they had been doing from their days on the LAW. The two temporary podcasts were folded into the Post Wrestling banner, becoming \"Rewind-a-Raw\" and \"Rewind-a-SmackDown\", while other LAW podcasts announced their relaunches under the Post Wrestling umbrella. The spiritual successor to the \"Live Audio Wrestling\" radio show, titled \"Sunday Night's Main Event\" was announced on April 3, 2018, and set to air the following Sunday, immediately following Wrestlemania 34; aside from their common origins, Post Wrestling and \"Sunday Night's Main Event\" are not formally associated with each other.\n\n\n\"Former co-hosts of the show include:\"\n\n\"Former co-hosts of the spinoff series shows include:\"\n^ List of presenters only until time of hiatus, for full list of former presenters and spinoff series shows see below.\n\nDue to the popularity of the show, TSN's Off the Record has had all past and current co-hosts of the radio program, excluding John Pollock, as guest panelists on the program, over the years.\n\nOver the years, there have been several radio shows and podcasts that have complemented the LAW. Since the shutdown of the LAW, these shows were also put on hiatus, with many of them migrating to Post Wrestling upon the latter's launch in December 2017.\n\nAs a spinoff of \"Review-A-Wai\", John Pollock and Wai Ting also review each week's edition of \"WWE Raw\" in a separate podcast series. As with \"Review-A-Wai\", each episode John Pollock and Wai Ting run down the previous episode of \"WWE Raw\" and end by reading listener feedback. The first episode of Review-A-Raw was posted on July 6, 2010. For a time in 2011, \"Review-A-Raw\" was available as a live podcast, airing over the internet via Stickam immediately following \"WWE Raw\", but it reverted to a taped format over technical issues resulting in one or both hosts being knocked off of the air.\n\nAs announced during a live \"Review-A-Wai\" podcast held immediately prior to WrestleMania 31, the \"Review-A-Raw\" name expanded to also encompass a television series broadcast on Fight Network, with John Pollock and Wai Ting as co-hosts. The televised version of \"Review-A-Raw\" is effectively a televised recording session of the podcast, with the actual \"WWE Raw\" review content identical in both versions. However, some segments have been modified to suit the television audience, such as the omission of listener feedback and a shorter banter portion at the start of the show that more directly relates to the co-hosts' positions at Fight Network. As both the podcast and televised shows are produced in the same sitting, there may be segments omitted from the televised portion; a selection of segments from the podcast version may be, at their discretion, posted to the Fight Network's YouTube page as \"Review-A-Raw Extra\"; the first \"Review-A-Raw Extra\" segment was dedicated to a contest selecting the televised series' theme music. As the podcast version takes precedence, the television edition of the show is likely to be pre-empted in the event of other Fight Network commitments by either host; this first occurred on July 5, 2016, where Jason Agnew would host an audio-only edition in lieu of the televised show, due to John and Wai covering UFC 200 for Fight Network. The final \"podcast-only\" episode of \"Review-A-Raw\" was posted March 31, 2015, with the first episode of the televised series aired on Fight Network on April 7, 2015.\n\nIn January 2016, John Pollock and Wai Ting also produced an additional televised segment, \"Raw in 3 Minutes\", co-branded with Fight Network's \"Fight News Now\" branding; both the full televised version and \"Raw in 3 Minutes\" is available from the \"Live Audio Wrestling\" YouTube channel. In mid-2017, \"Review-A-Raw\" was made into a web-only video series alongside \"Review-a-SmackDown\", ending the run of \"Raw in 3 Minutes\".\n\nThe last episode of \"Review-a-Raw\" was posted on October 23, 2017. Following the shutdown of the LAW a week later, John Pollock and Wai Ting continued to post audio reviews of \"Raw\" under the temporary title of \"John Pollock and Wai Ting Review Raw\". The full-time replacement for \"Review-a-Raw\" under the Post Wrestling banner, \"Rewind-a-Raw\", launched on December 25, 2017.\n\nOn selected weeks with a live episode of WWE SmackDown, a third LAW podcast starring John Pollock and Wai Ting is also available for download on Wednesdays. Like \"Review-A-Raw\" and \"Review-An-Impact\", Review-A-SmackDown reviews the previous episode of \"WWE SmackDown\", ending with listener feedback. The first episode of \"Review-A-SmackDown\" was posted on August 31, 2011, with Jason Agnew filling in for Wai Ting; the first episode with Wai Ting was posted on December 1, 2011. Up until the second WWE brand extension, \"Review-A-SmackDown\" would be produced only on a show-by-show basis, and not every live episode of \"WWE SmackDown\" would be reviewed.\n\n\"Review-A-SmackDown\" would become a weekly podcast with the second WWE brand extension, complementing \"Review-A-Raw\". Unlike \"Review-A-Raw\", however, \"Review-A-SmackDown\" is intended to remain an audio-only podcast, and not a show that is meant to air on Fight Network. The first regular episode of \"Review-A-SmackDown\" was posted on July 19, 2016, covering the WWE draft that kicked off the second WWE brand extension.\n\nFor a brief time in 2017, \"Review-a-Smackdown\" was also made available as a web video, under the same format as \"Review-a-Raw\". The last episode of \"Review-a-Smackdown\" was posted on October 25, 2017. Following the shutdown of the LAW later that week, John Pollock and Wai Ting continued to post audio reviews of \"SmackDown\" under the temporary title of \"John Pollock and Wai Ting Review SmackDown\". The full-time replacement of \"Review-a-SmackDown\", under the Post Wrestling banner, \"Rewind-a-SmackDown\", launched on December 27, 2017.\n\nwhtsNXT (pronounced as \"what's next\") is a podcast hosted by Jason Agnew and technical producer Braden Herrington, focusing on NXT, while incorporating elements from \"Bite Network Radio\". The name was chosen to not only reflect the product being reviewed (a show based on developmental wrestling), but also the fact that this was Braden's first foray into radio broadcasting (having joined shortly after the LAW debuted on TSN Radio as one of his first industry jobs), and a turning point in Agnew's television career (having left Bite TV since the LAW debuted on TSN Radio, leaving him with no permanent work in television aside from \"Splatalot\"). It is seen as continuing in the \"rite of passage\" of LAW hosts moving up the ranks (Dan Lovranski, Jason Agnew, John Pollock, and Wai Ting were all, at one point, technical producers on The LAW), with the veteran Agnew guiding the rookie Braden, akin to \"NXT\" itself. The first episode was posted on October 7, 2013 as an addition to the LAW's podcast, but thereafter was separately posted on Thursdays thereafter.\n\n\"Bartender\" Dave debuted on the January 21st 2016 edition of \"whtsNXT\" alongside Jason Agnew, he has since become a regular guest host on the show. Since Takeover's moved to Saturdays on the same weekend as the WWE's Big 4 events, Takeover reviews have been added onto the end of The LAW podcast under the title of \"whtsNXTra\". Also since 2017 whtsNXT has chosen to skip the review of the post-Takeover NXT episodes, stating there's no point in reviewing a review show.\n\nThe last episode of \"whtsNXT\" was posted on October 26, 2017. A spiritual successor under the Post Wrestling banner, titled \"upNXT\" and hosted by Braden Herrington and Bartender Dave, was launched on March 22, 2018.\n\n\"Review-A-Wai\" is a weekly review podcast starring John Pollock and Wai Ting, which was originally presented immediately following the archived episode of the LAW and was later made available separately. The first episode was posted on September 13, 2009.\n\nThe two primarily review older wrestling pay-per-view events from the mid to late 1990s, but have since branched out to other media relating to wrestling and mixed martial arts. Notably, in a homage to an early \"Ask-a-Wai\" episode where John and Wai reviewed a wrestling-related pornographic film, the second and third anniversary shows had John and Wai review a wrestling-related pornographic film; the visible discomfort of Wai reviewing the film has led them to discontinue reviewing wrestling-related pornographic films. Reviews of classic events often contain audio clips from the show(s) they are reviewing; at the end of the show, John and Wai also respond to listener feedback after the review. On occasion, they air relevant clips from previous interviews conducted with various wrestling personalities and/or interview people involved with the event being reviewed, including clips from past \"Live Audio Wrestling\" shows. Each episode also ends with a piece of music specifically selected by one of the co-hosts, often relating to the show being reviewed.\n\nOn occasion, when either co-host is unavailable, a substitute co-host has joined the other co-host; most notably, Arda Ocal has been a guest reviewer on \"Review-A-Wai\" on several occasions during the years that the LAW and \"Aftermath\" (The Score Television Network's wrestling analysis show, co-hosted by Arda Ocal) were promoted together. Damian Abraham has also been a frequent guest reviewer, especially if the review contains a punk rock element.\n\nThe show ceased to be an add-on to the archived episode of the LAW in 2010 when the \"Review-A-Wai\" portion became as long as the archived episode of the LAW itself. \"Review-A-Wai\" was moved to a Wednesday release schedule following its second anniversary show, and later to late Tuesdays following the debut of \"whtsNXT\" so as to avoid multiple LAW podcasts being released on the same day. With the launch of \"Review-A-SmackDown\" as a regular weekly series, \"Review-A-Wai\" became a biweekly series posted on Fridays, alternating with \"Bauer & Pollock\". Following the end of \"Bauler & Pollock\", \"Review-A-Wai\" will continue to be a biweekly series on Fridays alternating with \"Keep It 2000\".\n\nThe final episode of \"Review-a-Wai\" was posted on October 19, 2017, with an announced episode that would have aired had the LAW not been shutdown. The first episode of the spiritual successor of \"Review-a-Wai\" under the Post Wrestling banner, \"Rewind-a-Wai\", launched with the review intended for the announced episode.\n\nJapanese Audio Wrestling is a monthly podcast hosted by Chris Charlton and WH Park, both having previously contributed to various LAW-related shows and podcasts, focusing in on Japanese wrestling. The first episode was posted on August 1, 2012. New host Jojo Remy joined the show on the January 6th, 2017, replacing the leaving pair of Chris Charlton & WH Park. From the 2017 April 3 edition WH Park has made a number of returning guest appearances.\n\nAlthough put on hiatus with the shutdown of the LAW in October 2017, as part of the launch of Post Wrestling, it was announced that \"Japanese Audio Wrestling\" would continue under the Post Wrestling banner with a new name, with no specified timeframe for a relaunch.\n\nRelated to \"Japanese Audio Wrestling\" is the LAW's daily coverage of the G1 Climax tournament each year, with John Pollock recapping most days of the tournament and Chris Charlton and WH Park recapping the remaining days of the tournament.\n\nThe MMA Report with John Pollock is a radio show hosted by John Pollock on TSN Radio, first airing on July 5, 2012. It airs Friday at midnight on TSN Radio (though the show itself is available as a podcast on the LAW podcast feed one day before), and is touted as \"the third hour\" of the LAW as repeats of the show air immediately after the LAW on weeks without an Ultimate Fighting Championship pay-per-view (when \"The UFC Post Fight Show\" airs in its place instead). As with the LAW, it is also broadcast in the Vancouver market (formerly CFTE and presently CKST) since 2013.\n\nThe show is also considered to be a spiritual successor to \"Fight Network Radio\", due to John Pollock's past and present connections.\n\nIn December 2016, Brian Mann and Nate Milton return with a new podcast, Keep It 2000 \"(billed as \"A Podcast On A Pole\")\". They embark on the worst decision of their lives – fully chronicling every WCW Nitro from the year 2000. Often considered the worst time period for any major wrestling promotion, these 52 episodes could prove to be the thing that finally breaks these podcasting brothers apart.\n\nThe final episode of \"Keep it 2000\" as a LAW podcast was posted on October 14, 2017. As part of the Post Wrestling launch in December 2017, it was announced that \"Keep it 2000\" would continue under the Post Wrestling umbrella; the first episode of \"Keep it 2000\" under the Post Wrestling umbrella was posted on January 25, 2017.\n\nBritish Audio Wrestling is a British Wrestling focused podcast launched by Martin Bushby and Oli Court, with the first episode posted on January 6, 2017. The pair were joined by Richard Benson of The Indy Corner from Episode 2 onwards. The show focuses in on UK promotions \"Progress Wrestling\", \"Revolution Pro Wrestling\", \"Fight Club: PRO\" & \"Over The Top Wrestling\" and also covers \"ITV World of Sport Wrestling\" & the \"WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament\".\n\nThe final episode of \"British Audio Wrestling\" was posted on October 17, 2017. As part of the Post Wrestling launch in December 2017, it was announced that \"British Audio Wrestling\" would continue under the Post Wrestling umbrella under a new name, later revealed to be the \"British Wrestling Experience\". The first episode of the \"British Wrestling Experience\" launched on January 18, 2018.\n\nBauer & Pollock is a co-production between \"Live Audio Wrestling\" and \"Major League Wrestling\", where John Pollock and Court Bauer discuss the business of professional wrestling and mixed martial arts. Although initially designed to be a biweekly series, it was moved to a weekly format soon after, available on both the MLW and LAW podcast feeds. The show was originally posted on Fridays, but was moved to late Wednesdays to avoid having multiple LAW podcasts being posted on the same day. With the launch of \"Review-A-SmackDown\" as a weekly series, \"Bauer & Pollock\" became a biweekly series posted on Fridays, alternating with \"Review-A-Wai\". After a lengthy hiatus on 12 January 12, 2017, \"The Final Edition\" of Bauer & Pollock was uploaded. The reason behind the decision to end Bauer & Pollock was the large workloads of each host and inability to find a common free day to do the podcast. On March 17, 2017, Court & John returned for a \"One-Off\" special, continuing to do almost one show every month since.\n\nAsk-A-Wai was an add-on to the end of each LAW broadcast starting in September 2008, and starred John Pollock and Wai Ting, then call screener on the LAW. It was taped immediately following \"Live Audio Xtra\", and was a general discussion podcast and generally unrelated to wrestling. In late 2009, Jason Agnew joined Ask-A-Wai as a co-host, though retaining the same format as before.\n\n\"Ask-A-Wai\" ended with the move of the LAW from CFRB to Hardcore Sports Radio, though the \"Ask-A-Wai\" format would be succeeded with the \"Bite Network Radio\" podcast. \"Bite Network Radio\" itself would be hosted by Jason Agnew and John Pollock, retaining the format of \"Ask-A-Wai\", and occasionally featuring Wai Ting and other members from their circle of friends. Like \"Ask-A-Wai\", \"Bite Network Radio\" was taped immediately following the LAW.\n\n\"Bite Network Radio\" ended with the move of the LAW to TSN Radio, as the studios at TSN could no longer accommodate all of the regular hosts. Though \"The Late Shift\", a radio show hosted by Jason Agnew on CFRB, is touted as the spiritual successor of Bite Network Radio, it follows a different format and has no formal association to the LAW.\n\nStarting in 2011 with UFC 140, The LAW started to present a UFC post fight show on TSN Radio 1050. The show airs after the conclusion of the most recent Ultimate Fighting Championship event and provides results and opinions from callers and MMA journalists. Though originally branded as a LAW show, since the launch of \"The MMA Report\" the show has used the latter show's branding.\n\nEach Saturday (some episodes may be delayed to Sunday), former WWE writer Brian Mann and frequent LAW contributor Nate Milton review the previous edition of \"Impact Wrestling\".\n\nOriginally hosted by John Pollock and Wai Ting as a counterpart to \"Review-a-Raw\", the first episode of Review-An-Impact was posted on November 5, 2010. Since September 2011, Nate Milton (nicknamed \"The Godfather, TNAte\" in the LAW community) has been featured in a recurring segment on \"Review-An-Impact\" where he provides separate analysis of the episode; this was often in the form of an interview with one of the co-hosts. In the event that either host was unavailable, Nate takes on the role of co-host for the entire podcast in place of the segment. In late 2014, due to Wai Ting's other commitments, Nate Milton became a co-host on a more full-time basis, though the arrangement lasted for only a few weeks due to the termination of \"Impact Wrestling\" on Spike TV; Wai Ting's final episode of Review-An-Impact was on October 23, 2014.\n\nWith the relaunch of \"Impact Wrestling\" on Destination America, \"Review-An-Impact\" was revamped with Brian Mann as the lead host, initially with John Pollock as co-host in the pilot episode on January 8, 2015, and with Nate Milton as co-host on a full-time basis on the following episode. Due to being the first \"all-American podcast\" in the LAW family, and with neither co-host hosting another LAW podcast, \"Review-An-Impact\" also expanded their scope to include their commentary on general wrestling news, diversity issues in professional wrestling, pop culture (largely as a result of Brian later joining Yahoo! Movies), and politics in general.\n\nWith the declining relevance of TNA in North American professional wrestling in 2015 (and the impending end of the TNA/Destination America partnership), \"Live Audio Wrestling\" decided to terminate coverage of TNA following the 2015 Bound for Glory event; the final regular episode of \"Review-an-Impact\" (an episode dedicated to counting down the \"Top 10 moments in Impact Wrestling history\") aired on October 3, 2015.\n\nBilled as \"the realest show about being fake\", \"Keep it 100\" is a podcast that serves as a spiritual successor to \"Review-An-Impact\", hosted by Brian Mann and Nate Milton. The idea behind the show came from the viewer feedback segments from \"Review-an-Impact\", where general questions regarding the co-hosts' opinions started to dominate the discourse as opposed to feedback related to episodes of the episodes of \"Impact Wrestling\" being reviewed. With \"Live Audio Wrestling\" deciding to terminate coverage of TNA, it was agreed that the viewer feedback segment would effectively be expanded to cover the entire show.\n\nThe concept of this podcast, where the co-hosts must answer every question asked of them with absolute truth, was largely inspired by the segment of the same name on \"The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore\". Similar to its predecessor, topics covered by the show are primarily focused on general wrestling news, diversity in professional wrestling, wrestling as it relates to pop culture, with a slight nod to politics. The first episode aired on October 9, 2015.\n\nDue to the hosts' other commitments, \"Keep It 100\" aired for only seven weeks as a weekly series, though various special shows have been posted on an irregular basis, including those dedicated to covering TNA special events.\n\n\"Review-A-Merica\" was a one-off podcast covering the 2012 United States presidential election from the perspective of two Canadians (John and Wai).\n\nIn 2016, Brian and Nate revived the \"Review-A-Merica\" podcast for a series of shows covering the 2016 United States presidential election from a \"wrestling with democracy\" perspective.\n\nThe \"Ask-A-Wai\" name would later be reused for a video podcast series featuring John Pollock and Wai Ting in late 2011, as a complement to \"Review-A-Wai\", where John Pollock and Wai Ting answered questions submitted by \"Review-A-Wai\" fans regarding pro wrestling and mixed martial arts.

The brand was popular in Argentina between the 1970s and the 1980s. Most were diecast seconds or knockoffs of early Mattel Hot Wheels.\n\nMuky was made by Induguay S.A. \"Fabrica de Juguetes Muky\" (in Spanish: \"Muky Toy Factory\"). Established by the DeConti brothers, the company was located in the city of Gualeguay, Entre Rios province, 145 miles north of Buenos Aires (Frasinetti No date).\n\nVirtually all of the models made by Muky were copies of early Mattel Hot Wheels like the Custom Corvette, the Lola T70, the Custom Eldorado, or the Dodge Deora. Thus the company is often called the \"Hot Wheels of Argentina\" (Weber and Sahakangas website). Muky were not as popular, or as collectible today, as the country's Buby toys, which made Argentine Ramblers and Falcons and other vehicles that may have been more familiar to children there (Sinclair 1976).\n\nIn the late 1970s, because of the worsening economic environment in Argentina, the DeConti brothers moved to Brazil and began manufacturing toys there called Super veloz. In 1984 or 1985, a certain Dell Arciprete bought Muky, and using most of the same dies, again began making Mukys (Frasinetti No date). Arciprete's Muky also added a few new vehicles. The Arciprete family ran a fumigation business at the same time as Muky (Frasinetti No date).\n\nThe later Mukys were numbered from eight to 40, numbers one through eight having been lost along the line somewhere. Also, these later models' chassis were cast in plastic and Mukys were distributed to Uruguay and Spain, besides the patria Argentina (Frasinetti No date). \n\nHow Induguay came to possess the Mattel dies is uncertain; one story is that the DeConti brothers stole the dies from Mattel, but two other prevalent theories exist, both logical. One is that the models were carefully copied from blueprints (Frasinetti 2009; Frasinette No date). Another is that third party agents, with the approval of Mattel, sold some dies to the De Contis (Frasinetti 2009). In any event, perusal of catalogs of old and new models shows that few of the 37 models originally manufactured by Induguay were ever reissued by Mattel. Apparently, the Arciprete family has kept the tooling and doesn't deny that they might again someday make more Mukys (Frasinetti No date).\n\nFrasinetti, Bob. No date. Muky, Made in Argentina.

{"id": "54783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54783", "title": "Music theory", "text": "Music theory\n\nMusic theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. \"The Oxford Companion to Music\" describes three interrelated uses of the term \"music theory\":\n\nThe first is what is otherwise called 'rudiments', currently taught as the elements of notation, of key signatures, of time signatures, of rhythmic notation, and so on. [...] The second is the study of writings about music from ancient times onwards. [...] The third is an area of current musicological study that seeks to define processes and general principles in music — a sphere of research that can be distinguished from analysis in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.\n\nMusic theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of what constitutes music (see Definition of music), a more inclusive definition could be that music theory is the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence, as they relate to music. This is not an absolute guideline; for example, the study of \"music\" in the \"Quadrivium\" liberal arts university curriculum that was common in medieval Europe was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice. However, this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries, and it is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.\n\nMusic theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts composers and other musicians use in creating music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from Mesopotamia, China, and prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers (see History of music and Musical instrument). In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are clearly visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music making. Many cultures, at least as far back as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient China, have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.\n\nIn modern academia, music theory is a subfield of musicology, the wider study of musical cultures and history. Etymologically, \"music theory\" is an act of contemplation of music, from the Greek θεωρία, a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle. As such, it is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships, but there is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production. A person who researches, teaches, or writes articles about music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the M.A. or Ph.D level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by Western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of musical acoustics, considerations of musical notation, and techniques of tonal composition (harmony and counterpoint), among other topics.\n\nPreserved prehistoric instruments, artifacts, and later depictions of performance in artworks can give clues to the structure of pitch systems in prehistoric cultures. See for instance Paleolithic flutes, Gǔdí, and Anasazi flute.\n\nSeveral surviving Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets include musical information of a theoretical nature, mainly lists of intervals and tunings. The scholar Sam Mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500 BCE, a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought. Further, \"All the Mesopotamian texts [about music] are united by the use of a terminology for music that, according to the approximate dating of the texts, was in use for over 1,000 years.\"\n\nMuch of Chinese music history and theory remains unclear.\n\nThe earliest texts about Chinese music theory are inscribed on the stone and bronze bells excavated in 1978 from the tomb of Marquis Yi (died 433 BCE) of the Zeng state. They include more than 2800 words describing theories and practices of music pitches of the time. The bells produce two intertwined pentatonic scales three tones apart with additional pitches completing the chromatic scale.\n\nChinese theory starts from numbers, the main musical numbers being twelve, five and eight. Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed. The Lüshi chunqiu from about 239 BCE recalls the legend of Ling Lun. On order of the Yellow Emperor, Ling Lun collected twelve bamboo lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it \"huangzhong\", the \"Yellow Bell.\" He then heard phoenixes singing. The male and female phoenix each sang six tones. Ling Lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes, producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets: six from the male phoenix and six from the female: these were called the \"lülü\" or later the \"shierlü\".\n\nThe \"lülü\" formed the ritual scale to which many instruments were tuned. The name of the lowest sound, \"huangzhong\" also implied 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base pitch of zithers, flutes and singers of imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of cast metal, their lengths specified by court regulations. The resulting chromatic scale provided twelve fundamental notes for the construction of the musical scales themselves. The \"lülü\" also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.\n\nThe two sets of tones (male and female) dividing the twelve-tone scale were generated by the \"Method of Subtracting and Adding Thirds,\" or \"sanfen sunyi\", which involved alternately rising a fifth and descending a fourth through the subtraction or addition of a third of the length of the preceding pitch pipe. The resulting pitches produced by adding a third (and descending a fourth) were referred to by Sima Qian in the Records of the Grand Historian (91 BCE) as pitches of \"superior generation,\" that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s male phoenix; the pitches produced by subtracting a third (and ascending a fifth) were referred to as pitches of \"inferior generation,\" that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s female phoenix.\n\n\"Apart from technical and structural aspects, ancient Chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music. The \"Yueji\" (\"Record of music\", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests Confucian moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of Mozi (c468–c376 BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and Laozi’s claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the \"qin\" zither, a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with Daoist references, such as \"Tianfeng huanpei\" (\"Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade Pendants\").\"\n\nThe Samaveda and Yajurveda (c. 1200 – 1000 BCE) are among the earliest testimonies of Indian music, but they contain no theory properly speaking. The Natya Shastra, written between 200 BCE to 200 CE, discusses intervals (\"Śrutis\"), scales (\"Grāmas\"), consonances and dissonances, classes of melodic structure (\"Mūrchanās\", modes?), melodic types (\"Jātis\"), instruments, etc.\n\nEarly preserved Greek writings on music theory include two types of works:\nSeveral names of theorists are known before these works, including Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE), Philolaus (c. 470 – c. 385 BCE), Archytas (428–347 BCE), and others.\n\nWorks of the first type (technical manuals) include\n\nMore philosophical treatises of the second type include\n\nSome imported early Chinese instruments became important components of the entertainment music of the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) courts: the bent-neck pipa (quxiang pipa), the bili, the konghou and the jiegu. They generated not only new repertories and performing practices but also new music theories. The pipa, for example, carried with it a theory of musical modes that subsequently led to the Sui and Tang theory of 84 musical modes.\n\nMedieval Arabic music theorists include:\n\nThe Latin treatise \"De institutione musica\" by the Roman philosopher Boethius (written c. 500) was a touchstone for other writings on music in medieval Europe. Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century. This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the plainchant tradition. At the end of the ninth century, Hucbald worked towards more precise pitch notation for the neumes used to record plainchant.\n\nGuido d'Arezzo' wrote in 1028 a letter to Michael of Pomposa, entitled \"Epistola de ignoto cantu\", in which he introduced the practice of using syllables to describe notes and intervals. This was the source of the hexachordal solmization that was to be used until the end of the Middle Ages. Guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes, the phrase structure of plainchant, the temporal meaning of the neumes, etc.; his chapters on polyphony \"come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account\" in the Western tradition.\n\nDuring the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called mensural notation grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise \"Ars cantus mensurabilis\" (\"The art of measured chant\") by Franco of Cologne (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in European classical music today.\n\nD'Erlanger divulges that the Arabic music scale is derived from the Greek music scale, and that Arabic music is connected to certain features of Arabic culture, such as astrology.\n\nAs Western musical influence spread throughout the world in the 1800s, musicians adopted Western theory as an international standard—but other theoretical traditions in both textual and oral traditions remain in use. For example, the long and rich musical traditions unique to ancient and current cultures of Africa are primarily oral, but describe specific forms, genres, performance practices, tunings, and other aspects of music theory.\n\nSacred Harp music uses a different kind of scale and theory in practice. The music focuses around the solfege \"fa, sol, la\" on the music scale. Sacred Harp also employs a different notation involving \"shape notes\", or notes that are shaped to correspond to a certain solfege syllable on the music scale. Sacred Harp music and its music theory originated with Reverend Thomas Symmes in 1720, where he developed a system for \"singing by note\" in order to help his church members with note accuracy.\n\nMusic is composed of aural phenomena; \"music theory\" considers how those phenomena apply in music. Music theory considers melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, the acoustics of pitch systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic sound production, etc.\n\nPitch is the lowness or highness of a tone, for example the difference between middle C and a higher C. The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation.\n\nSpecific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign Concert A (the A above middle C on the piano) to the frequency of 440 Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435 Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in historically informed performance of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.\n\nThe difference in pitch between two notes is called an interval. The most basic interval is the unison, which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The octave interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of pitch class: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single \"class\" by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class—the class that contains all C's. \n\nMusical tuning systems, or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In Western culture, there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as equal temperament is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.\n\nNotes can be arranged in a variety of scales and modes. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve tones, called a chromatic scale, within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a half step or semitone. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.\n\nThe most commonly encountered scales are the seven-toned major, the harmonic minor, the melodic minor, and the natural minor. Other examples of scales are the octatonic scale and the pentatonic or five-tone scale, which is common in folk music and blues. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical Ottoman, Persian, Indian and Arabic musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)—they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.\n\nIn traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a key signature at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.\n\nThe interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the circle of fifths. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the doctrine of the affections, were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. Indian classical music theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.\n\nConsonance and dissonance are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages.\nConsonance (or concord) is the quality of an interval or chord that seems stable and complete in itself. Dissonance (or discord) is the opposite in that it feels incomplete and \"wants to\" resolve to a consonant interval. Dissonant intervals seem to clash. Consonant intervals seem to sound comfortable together. Commonly, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant. All others are dissonant to greater or lesser degree.\n\nContext and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance. For example, in a Debussy prelude, a major second may sound stable and consonant, while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue. In the Common Practice era, the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth. Since the early 20th century, Arnold Schoenberg’s concept of \"emancipated\" dissonance, in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as \"higher,\" more remote consonances, has become more widely accepted.\n\nRhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time. Meter measures music in regular pulse groupings, called measures or bars. The time signature or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.\n\nThrough increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented. There are conventions in most musical traditions for regular and hierarchical accentuation of beats to reinforce a given meter. Syncopated rhythms contradict those conventions by accenting unexpected parts of the beat. Playing simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature is called polyrhythm.\n\nIn recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. The most highly cited of these recent scholars are Maury Yeston, Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, Jonathan Kramer, and Justin London.\n\nA melody is a series of tones sounding in succession that typically move toward a climax of tension then resolve to a state of rest. Because melody is such a prominent aspect in so much music, its construction and other qualities are a primary interest of music theory.\n\nThe basic elements of melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as scales or modes. Melody may consist, to increasing degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.\n\nA chord, in music, is any harmonic set of three or more notes that is heard as if sounding simultaneously. These need not actually be played together: arpeggios and broken chords may, for many practical and theoretical purposes, constitute chords. Chords and sequences of chords are frequently used in modern Western, West African, and Oceanian music, whereas they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.\n\nThe most frequently encountered chords are triads, so called because they consist of three distinct notes: further notes may be added to give seventh chords, extended chords, or added tone chords. The most common chords are the \"major\" and \"minor triads\" and then the \"augmented\" and \"diminished triads\". The descriptions \"major\", \"minor\", \"augmented\", and \"diminished\" are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal \"quality\". Chords are also commonly classed by their root note—so, for instance, the chord C major may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note C. Chords may also be classified by inversion, the order in which the notes are stacked.\n\nA series of chords is called a chord progression. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing key in common-practice harmony. To describe this, chords are numbered, using Roman numerals (upward from the key-note), per their diatonic function. Common ways of notating or representing chords in western music other than conventional staff notation include Roman numerals, figured bass (much used in the Baroque era), macro symbols (sometimes used in modern musicology), and various systems of chord charts typically found in the lead sheets used in popular music to lay out the sequence of chords so that the musician may play accompaniment chords or improvise a solo.\n\nIn music, harmony is the use of simultaneous pitches (tones, notes), or chords. The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them. Harmony is often said to refer to the \"vertical\" aspect of music, as distinguished from melodic line, or the \"horizontal\" aspect. Counterpoint, which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.\n\nIn popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. For example, a lead sheet may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. In many types of music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with \"tensions\". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass. Typically, in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord (chord with tension) \"resolves\" to a consonant chord. Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between \"tense\" and \"relaxed\" moments.\n\nTimbre, sometimes called \"color\", or \"tone color,\" is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume, a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright, dull, shrill, etc. It is of considerable interest in music theory, especially because it is one component of music that has as yet, no standardized nomenclature. It has been called \"...the psychoacoustician's multidimensional waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness,\" but can be accurately described and analyzed by Fourier analysis and other methods because it results from the combination of all sound frequencies, attack and release envelopes, and other qualities that a tone comprises.\n\nTimbre is principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of overtones produced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the envelope of the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time). Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer's technique. The timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing. For example, the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell, the player changes their embouchure, or volume.\n\nA voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus, (e.g. the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth). Musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique, volume, accent, and other means. These are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction. For example, the word \"dolce\" (sweetly) indicates a non-specific, but commonly understood soft and \"sweet\" timbre. \"Sul tasto\" instructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound. \"Cuivre\" instructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound. Accent symbols like \"marcato\" (^) and dynamic indications (\"pp\") can also indicate changes in timbre.\n\nIn music, \"dynamics\" normally refers to variations of intensity or volume, as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in decibels or phons. In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.\n\nThe conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words like \"forte\" (f) for loud and \"piano\" (p) for soft. These two basic notations are modified by indications including \"mezzo piano\" (mp) for moderately soft (literally \"half soft\") and \"mezzo forte\" (mf) for moderately loud, \"sforzando\" or \"sforzato\" (sfz) for a surging or \"pushed\" attack, or \"fortepiano\" (fp) for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level. The full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible \"pianissississimo\" (pppp) to a loud-as-possible \"fortissississimo\" (ffff).\n\nGreater extremes of pppppp and fffff and nuances such as p+ or \"più piano\" are sometimes found. Other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis: dB (decibels), numerical scales, colored or different sized notes, words in languages other than Italian, and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume (\"crescendo\") or decreasing volume (\"decrescendo\"), often called \"hairpins\" when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above.\n\nArticulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example, \"staccato\" is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value, \"legato\" performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.\n\nFor example, \"staccato\" is often referred to as \"separated\" or \"detached\" rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration. Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of \"staccato.\" The manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase, but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period (e.g. viol, wind; classical, baroque; etc.).\n\nThere are a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common. They are—from long to short: \"legato\" (smooth, connected); \"tenuto\" (pressed or played to full notated duration); \"marcato\" (accented and detached); \"staccato\" (\"separated\", \"detached\"); \"martelé\" (heavily accented or \"hammered\"). Many of these can be combined to create certain \"in-between\" articulations. For example, \"portato\" is the combination of \"tenuto\" and \"staccato\". Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as \"spicatto\" for bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.\n\nIn music, texture is how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many \"layers\" of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.\n\nThe thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece's texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the timbre of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, tempo, and rhythms used. The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.\n\nCommon types included monophonic texture (a single melodic voice, such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody), polyphonic texture and homophonic texture (chords accompanying a melody).\n\nThe term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the tenth edition of \"The Oxford Companion to Music\", Percy Scholes defines musical form as \"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\" According to Richard Middleton, musical form is \"the shape or structure of the work.\" He describes it through difference: the distance moved from a repeat; the latter being the smallest difference. Difference is quantitative and qualitative: \"how far\", and \"of what type\", different. In many cases, form depends on statement and restatement, unity and variety, and contrast and connection.\n\nMusical expression is the art of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, phrasing, differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.\n\nExpression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions. Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable emotion, ideally causing a sympathetic emotional response in its listeners. The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a national anthem), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.\n\nThe components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute.\n\nMusical notation is the written or symbolized representation of music. This is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation.In the 2000s, computer file formats have become important as well. Spoken language and hand signs are also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.\n\nIn standard Western music notation, tones are represented graphically by symbols (notes) placed on a staff or staves, the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time. Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the conductor are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.\n\nIn Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western Classical music, conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten chord chart indicating the song's chord progression using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.\n\nThe scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields, each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation.\n\nMusical analysis is the attempt to answer the question \"how does this music work?\" The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to Ian Bent, \"analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the Middle Ages onwards.\" Adolf Bernhard Marx was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as Edgard Varèse's claim that, \"to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work\".\n\nSchenkerian analysis is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of Heinrich Schenker (1868–1935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining tonality in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various techniques of elaboration. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of \"tonal space\". The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a \"tonal space\" that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.\n\nAlthough Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the fundamental structure (\"Ursatz\") to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the \"Ursatz\" is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise. Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is \"subjective\". There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst. The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.\n\nTransformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by David Lewin in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, \"Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations\". The theory, which models musical transformations as elements of a mathematical group, can be used to analyze both tonal and atonal music. The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objects—such as the \"C major chord\" or \"G major chord\"—to relations between objects. Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been \"transformed\" into the second by the \"Dominant operation.\" (Symbolically, one might write \"Dominant(C major) = G major.\") While traditional musical set theory focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the intervals or types of musical motion that can occur. According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, \"[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am \"at\" s and wish to get to t, what characteristic \"gesture\" should I perform in order to arrive there?'\"\n\nMusic psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both psychology and musicology. It aims to explain and understand musical behavior and experience, including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life. Modern music psychology is primarily empirical; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic observation of and interaction with human participants. Music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music performance, composition, education, criticism, and therapy, as well as investigations of human aptitude, skill, intelligence, creativity, and social behavior.\n\nMusic psychology can shed light on non-psychological aspects of musicology and musical practice. For example, it contributes to music theory through investigations of the perception and computational modelling of musical structures such as melody, harmony, tonality, rhythm, meter, and form. Research in music history can benefit from systematic study of the history of musical syntax, or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music. Ethnomusicology can benefit from psychological approaches to the study of music cognition in different cultures.\n\nA music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \"musical form\" and \"musical style\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.\n\nMusic can be divided into different genres in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term \"genre \"itself. In his book \"Form in Tonal Music\", Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and form. He lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the Renaissance period. To further clarify the meaning of \"genre\", Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre—both are violin concertos—but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the \"Agnus Dei\" from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\" Some, like Peter van der Merwe, treat the terms \"genre\" and \"style\" as the same, saying that \"genre\" should be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or \"basic musical language.\"\n\nOthers, such as Allan F. Moore, state that \"genre\" and \"style\" are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres. A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the musical techniques, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that \"since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".\n\nMusical technique is the ability of instrumental and vocal musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or vocal cords to produce precise musical effects. Improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility. To improve technique, musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the natural, minor, major, and chromatic scales, minor and major triads, dominant and diminished sevenths, formula patterns and arpeggios. For example, triads and sevenths teach how to play chords with accuracy and speed. Scales teach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another (usually by step). Arpeggios teach how to play broken chords over larger intervals. Many of these components of music are found in compositions, for example, a scale is a very common element of classical and romantic era compositions.\n\nHeinrich Schenker argued that musical technique's \"most striking and distinctive characteristic\" is repetition. Works known as études (meaning \"study\") are also frequently used for the improvement of technique.\n\nMusic theorists sometimes use mathematics to understand music, and although music has no axiomatic foundation in modern mathematics, mathematics is \"the basis of sound\" and sound itself \"in its musical aspects... exhibits a remarkable array of number properties\", simply because nature itself \"is amazingly mathematical\". The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of set theory, abstract algebra and number theory. Some composers have incorporated the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers into their work. There is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics. Though ancient Chinese, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound, the Pythagoreans (in particular Philolaus and Archytas) of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of musical scales in terms of numerical ratios.\n\nIn the modern era, musical set theory uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as transposition and inversion, one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called isometries because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an abelian group with 12 elements. It is possible to describe just intonation in terms of a free abelian group.\n\nIn music theory, serialism is a method or technique of composition that uses a series of values to manipulate different musical elements. Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of post-tonal thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's melody, harmony, structural progressions, and variations. Other types of serialism also work with sets, collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called \"parameters\"), such as duration, dynamics, and timbre. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the visual arts, design, and architecture\n\n\"Integral serialism\" or \"total serialism\" is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post–World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are \"general serialism\" and \"multiple serialism\".\n\nMusical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by Howard Hanson (1960) in connection with tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as Allen Forte (1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.\n\nOne branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as transposition, inversion, and complementation. The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.\n\nMusic semiology (semiotics) is the study of signs as they pertain to music on a variety of levels. Following Roman Jakobson, Kofi Agawu adopts the idea of musical semiosis being introversive or extroversive—that is, musical signs within a text and without. \"Topics,\" or various musical conventions (such as horn calls, dance forms, and styles), have been treated suggestively by Agawu, among others. The notion of gesture is beginning to play a large role in musico-semiotic enquiry.\n\nWriters on music semiology include Kofi Agawu (on topical theory, Heinrich Schenker, Robert Hatten (on topic, gesture), Raymond Monelle (on topic, musical meaning), Jean-Jacques Nattiez (on introversive taxonomic analysis and ethnomusicological applications), Anthony Newcomb (on narrativity), and Eero Tarasti (generally considered the founder of musical semiotics).\n\nRoland Barthes, himself a semiotician and skilled amateur pianist, wrote about music in \"Image-Music-Text,\" \"The Responsibilities of Form,\" and \"Eiffel Tower,\" though he did not consider music to be a semiotic system.\n\nSigns, meanings in music, happen essentially through the connotations of sounds, and through the social construction, appropriation and amplification of certain meanings associated with these connotations. The work of Philip Tagg (\"Ten Little Tunes\", \"Fernando the Flute\", \"Music’s Meanings\") provides one of the most complete and systematic analysis of the relation between musical structures and connotations in western and especially popular, television and film music. The work of Leonard Meyer in \"Style and Music\" theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.\n\nMusic theory in the practical sense has been a part of education at conservatories and music schools for centuries, but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent. In the 1970s, few universities had dedicated music theory programs, many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians, and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right. A growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists, rather than composers, performers or music historians. This led to the founding of the Society for Music Theory in the United States in 1977. In Europe, the French \"Société d'Analyse musicale\" was founded in 1985. It called the First European Conference of Music Analysis for 1989, which resulted in the foundation of the \"Société belge d'Analyse musicale\" in Belgium and the \"Gruppo analisi e teoria musicale\" in Italy the same year, the \"Society for Music Analysis\" in the UK in 1991, the \"Vereniging voor Muziektheorie\" in the Netherlands in 1999 and the \"Gesellschaft für Musiktheorie\" in Germany in 2000. They were later followed by the Russian Society for Music Theory in 2013 and the Polish Society for Music Analysis in 2015, and others are in construction. These societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers.\n\nAs part of their initial training, music theorists will typically complete a B.Mus or a B.A. in music (or a related field) and in many cases an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).\n\nMost music theorists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in colleges, universities or conservatories. The job market for tenure-track professor positions is very competitive. Applicants must hold a completed Ph.D or the equivalent degree (or expect to receive one within a year of being hired—called an \"ABD\", for \"All But Dissertation\" stage) and (for more senior positions) have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some Ph.D-holding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as sessional lecturers. The job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in this area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as Music Appreciation or Introduction to Music Theory), conducting research in this area of expertise, publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals, authoring book chapters, books or textbooks, traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field, and, if the program includes a graduate school, supervising M.A. and Ph.D students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as Dean or Chair of the School of Music.\n\n\n"}

Mystere, a male player on the Brell Serilis server who roleplayed and posted both as the female dark elf \"Mystere\" and, less frequently, a male Iksar character \"Vhasst\", wrote a fan fiction story which depicted the rape of a dark elf girl of \"barely 14 seasons\". This story was posted under the name \"Vhasst\" on July 11, 2000 to third-party Brell Serilis server boards not affiliated with Verant or Sony;\n\nAt some point afterwards, an anonymous party contacted Verant complaining about Mystere's story. On October 4, 2000, Mystere was abruptly kicked out of EverQuest, and the story was soon after removed from the IGN message board where it was originally posted. Upon contacting Mystere, George Scotto, head of customer service, informed him that he had been banned. According to Mystere:\n\nThis incident was discussed in two GameSpot articles under News and Features about the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark expansion. The first, on October 6, 2000, was a mention of the incident and the stir it had caused in the EverQuest gaming community. The second, on October 10, 2000, being a Q&A with Sony / Verant's John Smedley to get the publisher's perspective on what had occurred.\n\nThe incident also led to the removal of a quest in the game which requires the player to murder a pregnant halfling (due to criticism that the quest was as violent as anything in Mystere's story), became the subject of academic papers, and inspired a Penny Arcade cartoon as well as a week-long story arc in the PvP webcomic.\n\nSome years later, on February 16, 2006, John Smedley brought up the incident again on his blog. In his post, he claims that Verant took the heat silently over the debacle because the full story could not be disclosed to the public, and involved allegations of criminal behavior:\n\n"}

{"id": "38642163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38642163", "title": "Organisation of sport in Australia", "text": "Organisation of sport in Australia\n\nThe organisation of sport in Australia has been largely determined by its Federal system of government – Australian Government and six states and two territories governments and local governments. All three levels play an important role in terms of funding, policies and facilities. Each major sport is managed by a national sports organisation, with state counterparts that manage community sporting clubs. Umbrella or peak organisations represent the interests of sports organisations or particular sport issues. Education sector plays a small role through universities and schools. Private sector's involvement is extensive in professional sport through facilities, club ownership and finance/sponsorship.\n\nGovernment involvement in sport up until the 1970s was fairly limited with local governments playing a major role through the provision of sporting facilities. However, this changed over the next two decades with an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey in 2001–2002 finding that approximately $2 billion was spent on sport by three levels of government – 10 per cent from the Australian Government, 40 per cent from state and territory governments, and the remaining 50 per cent from local government. State, territory and local government spending was predominantly directed to facilities and their upkeep. This amount most likely has increased since that survey.\n\nNational Approach\nIn 1973, the Recreation Minister’s Council was established to provide a forum for Australian Government and State and Territory Minister’s responsible for sport and recreation to discuss matters of interest. With government's taking an increased involvement in sport, it became the Sport and Recreation Minister’s Council. More recently is referred to as Meeting of Sport and Recreation Ministers. The Meeting is assisted by the Committee of Australian Sport and Recreation Officials (CASRO) previously called the Standing Committee on Sport and Recreation (SCORS). The Meeting works cooperatively on issues such as match fixing, sport participation and water safety. In 2011, Minister's signed the \"National Sport and Active Recreation Policy Framework\". The framework \"provides a mechanism for the achievement of national goals for sport and active recreation, sets out agreed roles and responsibilities of governments and their expectations of sport and active recreation partners.\" \n\nIn 1993, National Elite Sports Council was established to provide a forum for communication, issues management and national program co-ordination across the high performance in Australia. It includes representatives from AIS, State Institute /Academies, Australian Olympic Committee, Australian Paralympic Committee, and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association.\nIn 2011, \"National Institute System Intergovernmental Agreement\" provides \"guidance on how the sector will operate, with a principal focus on the delivery of the high performance plans of national sporting organisations.\"\n\nAustralian Government provided small amounts of funding in the 1950s and 1960s through the support of the National Fitness Council and international sporting teams such as the Australian Olympic team. The Australian Government's serious involvement and investment into sport came with it establishing the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in 1981. AIS was set up to improve Australia's performances in international sport which had started to decline in the 1960s and 1970s culminating in Australia winning no gold medals at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In 1985, the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) was established to improve the Australian Government's administration of sport in terms of funding, participation and elite sport. The 1989 Senate Inquiry into drugs in sport resulted in the establishment of the Australian Sport Drug Agency (now called Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA)) in 1990 to manage Australia's anti-doping program. The Minister for Sport is supported by the Office of Sport located in their department. The Office's works with the key agencies ASC and ASADA in the development of sport. Currently, the Office's main focus is in integrity of sport and bidding and hosting of major events in Australia.\n\nState and Territory governments have a department with responsibility for sport and recreation. These departments provide assistance to state sports organisations, develop and manage sporting facilities, provide financial assistance for major sporting events and develop policies to assist sports across their state or territory. Each Australian State and Territory has established its own institute/academy of sport – ACT Academy of Sport (established 1989), New South Wales Institute of Sport (1996), Northern Territory Institute of Sport (1996), Queensland Academy of Sport (1991), South Australian Sports Institute (1982), Tasmanian Institute of Sport (1985), Victorian Institute of Sport (1990) and Western Australian Institute of Sport (1984). These institutes/academies and the AIS work together through the National Institutes Network and the National Elite Sports Council. Victoria and New South Wales have established regional academies.\n\nMany state governments have facility management trusts to manage their major sporting precincts and facilities. Examples are Sydney Olympic Park Authority (New South Wales) and State Sports Centre Trust (Victoria).\n\nThere are 560 local councils across Australia. Local governments generally focus on the provision of facilities such as swimming pools, sporting fields, stadiums and tennis courts. Investment into sports development programs for local clubs is generally limited. In national sporting issues, local governments may be represented by Australian Local Government Association.\n\nin 2012, there were 102 national sports organisations (NSO) in Australia recognised by the Australian Sports Commission. 63 NSO's received funding from ASC in 2011–2012. All of these organisations are affiliated to an international organisation and where appropriate to the Australian Olympic Committee, Australian Paralympic Committee, Australian Commonwealth Games Association and the Confederation of Australian Sport. These organisations manage the participation and high performance sport programs of the sport.\n\nSeveral of the national sports organisations run professional sports competitions/leagues:\n\nThere are other leagues where athletes receive little remuneration. These include:\n\nNational sports organisation generally have eight affiliated state sports organisations that manage the activities of clubs in their state. This means there are over 800 state sports organisations in Australia. Most states have an organisation that represents their interests. These include Vicsport, NSW Sports Federation, ACTSPORT, Tasmanian Sports Federation, Western Australian Sports Federation, Sport SA, and Sports Federation of Queensland.\n\nCommunity sporting clubs are regarded as the lifeblood of Australian sport. These sporting clubs are affiliated to national and state sporting organisations. In 2010, Australian Bureau of Statistics found that 2.3 million or 14% of the adult population undertook voluntary work with the sport and recreation organisations, most likely to be sporting clubs. At the club level, volunteers include coaches, officials and administrators. Clubs generally receive their limited income from membership fees. Professional sporting clubs have been established to compete in national and international leagues such as Australian Football League, National Rugby League, A-League, ANZ Championship and Super 15.\n\nUniversity sport in Australia is based primarily around the provision of sporting clubs and facilities. Only a few universities offer individual athletic scholarships. This is very different from the United States system organised by the National Collegiate Athletic Association which has well organised sports programs with scholarships. There has been a recent trend for universities to become involved with professional sporting teams. University of Canberra is a major sponsor the ACT Brumbies and Victoria University has developed a strong partnership with the Western Bulldogs.\n\nMost State Education Departments have established special sports high schools. These schools offer opportunities for talent sports students to develop sport skills in an environment that balances their sporting and education commitments. Westfield Sports High in Sydney is an example of a specialist school.\n\nThere are a range of peak or umbrella organisations that represent the specific interests and provide advice to governments, sports organisations and the community. \n\nThis sector contributes to sport through facilities, finance and sponsorship. All professional sports competitions and their teams rely heavily on private sponsorship. This sponsorship is provided to national sports organisations and community clubs but at greatly reduced level. Only high profile sports organisations such as Australian Football League, Australian Rugby Union, Australian Rugby League Commission and Football Federation Australia have substantial sponsorship income. Many sporting venues have been renamed to include the sponsor's name to increase revenue. Examples include Etihad Stadium, Suncorp Stadium and Paterson's Stadium. Many professional sporting teams have a private ownership model. This is a growing trend but it has not been without its difficulties.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5822424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5822424", "title": "Private Parts (book)", "text": "Private Parts (book)\n\nPrivate Parts is the first book written by American radio personality Howard Stern. Released on October 7, 1993 by Simon & Schuster, it is the fastest-selling book in the company's history. It was later adapted into a film in 1997 starring Stern and his radio show staff as themselves. The early chapters are autobiographical, covering Stern's upbringing and early career, while later chapters are more in the style of a memoir, covering recurring themes from his radio show such as sex, flatulence, and celebrities.\n\nStern's choices for the title were \"I, Moron\", \"Mein Kampf\", and \"Penis\" (the last was considered as Stern thought it would lead to the amusing newspaper headline \"Howard Stern's \"Penis\" is a bestseller\") but were refused by the publisher, although \"Mein Kampf\" would be used as the title of the book's fifth chapter regarding the beginning of his career. They then compromised with the title \"Private Parts\", suggested by Stern's co-host Robin Quivers, which Stern liked as a sexual pun referring to the personal \"private parts\" of his life with a popular euphemism for genitalia.\n\nThe book received mixed reviews from critics, often drawing comparisons to Lenny Bruce's \"How to Talk Dirty and Influence People\". Like Stern's radio show, it received a great deal of opposition due to its content. It is number 86 on the American Library Association's list of the \"100 Most Frequently challenged books Between 1990 and 1999.\" A paperback edition was released in September 1994, where Pocket Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, printed a further 2.8 million copies. In late 1995, Stern published a second book called \"Miss America\".\n\nUpon its release, \"Private Parts\" quickly became the fastest-selling title in publisher Simon & Schuster's history. The sales were supported by Stern's book signing tour of various cities across the United States, with the largest crowd attendances ever. The success was in spite of mixed reviews and the refusal by several stores to carry the book over objections to its content. The Caldor chain of department stores modified the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list which was displayed in stores to remove \"Private Parts\" from the top position, moving all subsequent books up one. The inclusion of the book in library lists was also frequently challenged in subsequent years. The book spent five weeks at the top of the non-fiction list from the weeks of October 9 to November 6, 1993 before being displaced by \"See, I Told You So\" by Rush Limbaugh. \"Private Parts\" spent a total of twenty weeks on the \"NY Times\" Best Seller list, hitting the number one spot after a week of its release.\n\nIn the book's opening acknowledgements Stern thanks his co-author Larry \"Ratso\" Sloman as well as his staff and family. The first chapter is a story of a male listener of Stern's show masturbating while driving on his way to work to an interview of a woman about her first lesbian sexual encounter. Chapters two through six focus on Stern's upbringing and family. Initially Stern focuses on his birth, parents, sister and family through marriage. He then moves out to focus on his upbringing in Roosevelt, Long Island where he was one of few white boys in a predominantly black neighbourhood. Stern also uses this chapter to relay his thoughts on the topics from the time the book was published such as Spike Lee and his film \"Malcolm X\", and Rodney King and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The fourth chapter deals with Stern's adolescent sexual development including his earliest sexual experiences. He also details his sex life in college and the courtship of his eventual marriage to his wife Alison.\n\nThe fifth and sixth chapters deal with Stern's career in radio from childhood interest through his rise to prominence. Stern cites an early interest in radio from the age of five, and his father's assistance and encouragement in growing his early career. His days in college radio are detailed followed by his earliest jobs at radio stations along the East Coast of the United States. He then details his career at radio stations WWWW in Detroit, Michigan, WWDC in Washington, D.C. and finally WNBC in New York City. Stern's conflict with management at various radio stations are relayed, including a rather detailed conflict with WNBC Program Director Kevin Metheny (whom he refers to as \"Pig Virus\").\n\nChapters seven through eighteen move through a variety of topics beginning with his celebrity interviews. This includes individuals such as Sandi Korn, Bob Hope, Jessica Hahn, Richard Simmons, and Sylvester Stallone and his family. The book then moves into Stern's views on various groups especially the French, the Germans, Filipinos, and \"everybody else\".\n\nThe book then details the Fartman character including the origins, and his appearance on the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. This is followed up by a listing of various regulars on his show referred to as the Wack Pack. Celebrities are revisited as Stern details those who irritate him, such as Oprah Winfrey, Arsenio Hall, and Madonna. Stern follows this up by revisiting his various sexual topics with stories of strippers, nudity, masturbation, and more lesbian sexual encounters.\n\nStern then returns to the familiar topic of celebrities, this time detailing feuds he has had with people such as the musical group Bon Jovi, Sam Kinison, Magic Johnson, and a physical altercation with Elaine Boosler at the Grammy Awards. Stern revisits homosexuality once again, this detail his musings on gay men. He then goes into comedy as he lists various comedians of the day and gives his opinion, including show regulars Kinison and Andrew Dice Clay. Lesbianism is revisited for the last time as another lesbian sex story is relayed. The seventeenth chapter details his interviews conducted by staff members Gary Dell'Abate and \"Stuttering John\" Melendez. The last chapter is reserved for Stern's critics and their efforts to have his show prohibited, and his response to them. An afterword is written by two psychologists who analyze Stern's personality and provide their professional opinion of the man.\n\nStern's venture into literature drew much of the same criticism as his radio show. \"Private Parts\" drew favorable comparisons to Lenny Bruce and his book \"How to Talk Dirty and Influence People\", but it was also characterized as nothing more than an extension of his radio show with little more to offer. Stern was praised for his populist message and attracting a group of people who normally do not read either by choice or for lack of ability. Another frequent criticism was that the material was juvenile, with little more to offer than stories of \"breasts, behinds, penises, masturbation, defecation, and the expulsion of gas\".\n\nThe book frequently drew comparisons to Lenny Bruce's 1965 autobiography \"How to Talk Dirty and Influence People\". In some instances the comparison was favorable, citing Stern's as the best book by a comedian since Bruce's. Others felt Stern fell short of the mark, or at least not influencing people as suggested by his ratings in certain radio markets.\n\nAs the host of a highly rated radio show, the comparison between the book and his radio show was inevitable. The radio show was often the starting point from which the reviewer based their opinion of the book. Sometimes the praise for the book came in spite of the critic's distaste for the show, but often it was used to damn the book as nothing more than a collection of radio show highlights in print, but in more explicit detail. Critics would sometimes qualify that they could not adequately relay the stories because of their papers' editorial standards.\n\nWith the considerable audience from his radio show, Stern was able to sell the first printing of his book within hours of its release. This was in spite of a perception of Stern's listeners who were considered to not be given to reading books, or even illiterate. The strong sales were seen as reflection of his populist appeal to a middle-class white male demographic who compose a large part of the fan base of his show. The main reason given for his appeal at the time was as backlash from a push towards what was considered political correctness.\n\nAnother frequent observation about the book was that it was juvenile both in its topics and layout. This included being compared to a comic book for its heavy use of pictures and varying fonts. Margo Jefferson of the New York Times enjoyed the way it broke up the book, as this allowed readers to read the passages out of sequence. The reliance on stories of body parts, functions, and human sexuality were also cited as a reason for what constituted the entirety of the book, and were not seen as compelling to some readers. In one instance the review was given by a high school student.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26442", "title": "Roppongi", "text": "Roppongi\n\nThe name \"Roppongi\", which appears to have been coined around 1660, literally means \"six trees\". Six very old and large zelkova trees used to mark the area; the first three were cleared, and the last were destroyed during World War II. Another legend has it that the name comes from the fact that six \"daimyōs\" lived nearby during the Edo period, each with the kanji character for \"tree\" or a kind of tree in their names. Roppongi was not extensively populated until after the Meiji Restoration, although the area was trafficked for centuries and served as the site of the cremation of Shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada's wife in 1626.\n\nIn 1890, the Third Imperial Guard of the Imperial Japanese Army was moved to a site near Roppongi (now home to the Pacific bureau of \"Stars and Stripes\"). The influx of soldiers led to the area's rise as a nightlife district, briefly interrupted by the Great Kanto earthquake which flattened the area in 1923. Roppongi was administratively part of Azabu Ward from 1878 to 1947.\n\nAfter World War II, during which the area was again destroyed, this time by aerial bombing raids, the United States Army and Allied government officials occupied several facilities in the area, beginning Roppongi's reputation as a neighborhood with large numbers of non-Japanese. Several large US military installations were located in the nearby area, with Hardy Barracks probably the most significant (the US Embassy Housing Compound and Akasaka Press Center including Hardy Barracks Recreational Lodging, \"Stars and Stripes\" office and heliport are still there). Surrounding the military installations were many Japanese-owned restaurants, pool halls, bars, and brothels which catered to US military personnel but were also often frequented by Japanese customers.\n\nStarting in the late 1960s, Roppongi became popular among Japanese people and foreigners alike for its disco scene, which attracted many of Tokyo's entertainment elites. Contributing to the international scene was the location of several foreign embassies and foreign corporate offices in the Roppongi area. However, many dance clubs shut down in the recession following the market crash of 1989.\n\nThe Roppongi area received a major economic boost in 2002–2003 when the Izumi Garden Tower and the Roppongi Hills high-rise complexes were completed. These projects brought high-end office and condominium space to Roppongi for the first time. The Tokyo Midtown project, which was completed in 2006, and includes the first Tokyo Ritz-Carlton Hotel, continued this trend.\n\nThe area features numerous bars, nightclubs, strip clubs, restaurants, hostess clubs, cabarets, and other forms of entertainment. Among the expatriate community, the area tends to be favored by business people, students, and off-duty US military personnel. Overall, the neighborhood caters to a younger crowd.\nClubs can range from large, multi-level establishments, to smaller one-room clubs located in upper levels of buildings.\nIn more recent times some of the larger venues with known Yakuza connections have closed.\n\nRestaurants in Roppongi vary from upscale Japanese fare to popular international restaurants.\n\nIn the past, Roppongi had a reputation as an area with high Yakuza presence, whether as customers at Roppongi establishments, conducting business, or managing or owning clubs and bars in the area. Although still exerting some influence in Roppongi, in recent times they appear to have shifted much of their presence to other districts in the Tokyo area.\n\nIn 2006, Nigerian immigrants to Japan began opening a number of bars and nightclubs in the area, following an earlier group of innovators who had been in business in Roppongi for many years. The Nigerians were noted for using visible, high-pressure tactics to draw customers to their bars. In 2009 and 2010 a series of drink-spiking incidents, in which customers reported being drugged and robbed, were linked to Nigerian-owned bars. The incidents resulted in the United States embassy in Japan warning US citizens to avoid certain bars and clubs in Roppongi. An investigation by \"The Japan Times\" in July 2011 found that though drink spiking occurred, most of the incidents did not involve criminal activity. Many customers claimed unusually severe hangovers after nights spent in Nigerian-run establishments. Similar complaints are often made about non-Nigerian bars in Roppongi that offer unlimited drink packages and often lace drinks with hard liquor to minimize customer consumption and increase profit.\n\nMori Building Company and The Pokémon Company have their headquarters in the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower.\n\nCompanies based in Roppongi include:\n\nA number of multinational firms have their Japanese offices in Roppongi, including investment banks Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, State Street, manufacturer Corning Incorporated, and law firms Allen & Overy, Davis Polk & Wardwell, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.\n\n\nPublic elementary and middle schools are operated by the Minato City (the Minato Ward) Board of Education. Roppongi Junior High School is located at Imoarai-Zaka, in Roppongi.\n\nPublic high schools are operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education. Roppongi High School is located in Roppongi.\n\nToyo Eiwa Jogakuin is private girls school, also located at Torii-Zaka in the district.\n\nThe American School in Japan Early Learning Center is in Roppongi Hills.\n\n"}

{"id": "51628328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51628328", "title": "Ruski car Tavern", "text": "Ruski car Tavern\n\nRuski Car or Russian Tsar () is a commercial-residential building and a restaurant in downtown Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in Knez Mihailova Street, a pedestrian zone and a commercial hub of the city. One of the most luxurious restaurants in the city at the time, it was described as a place where \"people come to be seen\". The building, finished in 1926, was declared a cultural monument in 1987.\n\nThe building is located on the corner of 7 Knez Mihailova (the official address) and 29 Obilićev Venac Streets. It is situated in the western extension of the Republic Square, across the Cultural Center of Belgrade and in the vicinity of Hotel Majestic, with the National Theater in Belgrade being right across the square.\n\nThe original restaurant was opened in 1890. Almost immediately it became the gathering place for the city elite and the distinguished guests from abroad. The esteemed venue was described as a place where \"people come to be seen\". It was named Ruski Car (\"Russian Tsar\") after Alexander II of Russia, who was assassinated in 1881.\n\nThe present building was constructed between 1922 and 1926 after the design of the architect Petar Popović, and with the assistance of the architect Dragiša Brašovan in the development of the project. The construction works were done by Milan Sekulić and his company \"Arhitekt\".\n\nThe purpose of the building has not significantly changed since the erection: the residential area is on the upper floors, the business space in the mezzanine and the restaurant on the ground floor and in the basement. The name of the old, ground floor venue of \"Ruski Car\", which was demolished to make room for the new building, was kept. During the Interbellum, it was an elegant Belgrade restaurant, the meeting place for both noble citizens and the intellectual elite of that time. The meetings of Serbian engineers and architects were held in the Ruski Car both before and after the World War I. Distinguished regular guests in this period included Veljko Petrović, Branislav Nušić and .\n\nThe new Communist authorities after the World War II confiscated the building and nationalized it in 1960. That year, the first Belgrade's \"express restaurant\", a self-serving buffet restaurant with cooked meals, was open in the building. The name of the tavern was changed to \"Zagreb\", the original luxurious interior was demolished and the expensive cutlery was replaced with the plastic plates.\n\nThe city owned company \"Stari Grad\" managed the restaurant. In the 1990s it leased it to the Serbian-Australian Jack Samardžija, who restored the venue to resemble the pre-1960 look and renamed it back to Ruski Car.\n\nIn 1998 the leaseholder became Snežana Bulić, wife of a criminal , who was killed that same year. \"Stari Grad\" was privatized by the \"Midlend\" company, but \"Ruski Car\" was excluded from the agreement and was separately sold by \"Stari Grad\" directly to Snežana Bulić in 2002 and the ownership later shifted to her son, Dragan Aca Bulić. Zoran Antonijević, whose father and other relatives constructed the building and were the owners since 1934, applied for the edifice to be returned to him when the process of the restitution of the confiscated properties began in Serbia. After the venue was sold, he filed a suite against \"Stari Grad\" and its successor. State Directory for properties issued a statement saying that the restitution law didn't exist at the time and that the property could be sold.\n\nIn May 2012, Bulić leased the restaurant to the German Vapiano restaurant chain for 10 years. Vapiano reshuffled the venue, reopened it in June and changed its name. The public protested, asking that city, if nothing else, marks the façade with the name \"Ruski Car\", regardless of how the name of the restaurant may be changed, but city didn't do it. In August 2013, the court ruled, within the process for the tax evasion by Bulić, that the property was acquired by the criminal activities and ordered for the restaurant to be taken away from Bulić and placed under the administration of the Directory for the seized property. From that point, Vapiano stopped paying the rent and in April 2014 the Directory temporarily closed the restaurant. After reaching an agreement with Vapiano, the venue was reopen after a month and a half. In December 2014, after Bulić's appeal, the court returned the restaurant to him, until the final judgment is ruled. During these processes, some business data surfaced into the public. It turned out that Vapiano was paying €40,000 per moth, which is stupendously high for Belgrade. Vapiano claimed that the rate would become gradually lower, after reaching a total of €750,000. Due to the all data presented, including other unlikely sums like Vapiano's claim that in April-May 2014 they lost €200,000 due to the temporary closing or that they invested €1,2 million in adaptation of the restaurant, reporters discussed the possibility that the entire business is a money laundering scheme. In August 2014 Antonijević died, but his descendants continued the restitution process.\n\nVapiano left the premises in January 2016 and by this time the state quit prosecuting Bulić for tax evasion so he remained the owner. The Antonijević family is still legally fighting for the building. There are several other examples in the Knez Mihailova and Obilićev Venac streets where nationalized property was sold in the late 1990s by the, so called, \"Šešelj law\", but the courts later annulled the contracts and returned the properties to the pre-war owners.\n\nIn October 2016 news appeared claiming that the first Belgrade's Hard Rock Café will be open in the building of Ruski Car. As of September 2017, the venue is still closed.\n\nAs a whole, the building has characteristics of academic mannerism and represents a typical large building erected in the city center in order to be rented. The decorations bear elements of neo-baroque in the design of the corner dome, whereas the corpus of the building is much closer to the academic variant of Art Nouveau, specifically the secession.\n\nThe tavern is situated within the Knez Mihailova Spatial Cultural-Historical Unit of Exceptional Importance, which was declared in 1979, by \"The Official Gazette of the Socialist Republic of Serbia\", No. 14/79.\n\nThe building itself was declared a cultural monument by the city's decision, announced in the \"Official Gazette of the City of Belgrade\", No. 16/87, from 10 July 1987.\n\n"}
{"id": "36596001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36596001", "title": "Silas Leachman", "text": "Silas Leachman\n\nSilas Field Leachman (20 August 1859 – 28 April 1936) was an American pioneer recording artist, possibly the first person to make recordings in Chicago and known for making hundreds of thousands of phonograph cylinder recordings in the 1890s.\n\nHe was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and worked on the railroad before marrying and moving to Chicago in the 1880s. He began recording for the North American Phonograph Company's Chicago branch around 1892, then recorded prolifically for the Chicago Talking Machine Company in the later 1890s. He later recorded for Columbia and, after 1901, Victor. According to a report first published in the \"Chicago Tribune\" in 1895, he recorded in a wide range of styles, often under assumed names, and by that time claimed to have personally produced almost 250,000 cylinders. The report sets out in detail Leachman's work, at the very start of the recording industry:\nAway out in the extreme northwestern part of the city, near the Milwaukee Railroad tracks, Silas Leachman puts in four or five hours every day singing at the top of his lungs, though not a soul is in hearing but his wife. When he gets tired of singing, he varies the proceedings by preaching a negro sermon, or gives an imitation of an Irish wake, and altogether conducts himself in a way that would lead the neighbors to consider him a fit subject for a lunatic asylum — if there were any neighbors, but there are not.This is the very reason Mr. Leachman chose the lonely spot for his residence. No one ever goes out there to hear him sing, and yet he is getting rich at it. He earns something over $50 every day, though he never sees one of his auditors. Mr. Leachman sings for phonographs, and, as he has a monopoly of the business in the West, he contrives to keep busy, and has even been heard to express a wish that he were twins. He has better protection in his monopoly than a copyright or an injunction, or unlimited legal talent could afford. Nature gave him the peculiar qualities that enable him to reproduce his voice perfectly on the wax cylinders. Hundreds of persons have attempted to break in on his profitable monopoly, but the results of their efforts put an effectual stop to their attempts. And so Mr. Leachman goes on enjoying the monopoly and reaping the profits thereof.There are four other men in the East that also do work for the phonograph; but while they have to have a man to play the piano while they sing, another to make the announcement, another to change the cylinders, and a fourth to keep the machines in order, Mr. Leachman is the entire show in himself. Furthermore, he can give an unlimited number of impersonations, while the other four men are limited to a few specialties each. Mr. Leachman is a natural mimic, and therein lies the secret of his success. He sings ballads, negro melodies, and Irish, Chinese and Dutch dialect songs. He plays his own accompaniment on the piano and takes care of the machines. He prepares three \"records\", as the wax cylinders are called, at one time.To do this three phonographs are placed near the piano, with the horns at one side pointing away from the keyboard at an angle of forty-five degrees. The horns have to be placed very carefully, for a fifth of an inch makes a great difference in the tone the cylinders will reproduce. When the horns have been adjusted exactly right, Mr. Leachman seats himself at the piano, and, turning his head away over his right shoulder, begins to sing as loud as he can, and that is pretty loud, for he is a man of powerful physique, and has been practicing loud singing for four years. He has been doing this work until his throat has become calloused so that he no longer becomes exhausted after singing a short time.As soon as he has finished one song, he slips off the wax cylinders, puts on three fresh ones without leaving his seat, and goes right on singing until a passing train compels him to stop for a short time. In the four years he has been in the business he has made nearly 250,000 records. So great is the demand for them that he cannot fill his orders. It is such exceedingly hard work that he cannot sing more than four hours a day. He gets thirty-five cents for every cylinder that he prepares. He has a repertoire of four hundred and twenty pieces, and his work is put on the market under a score of names. He has a remarkable memory, and, after once hearing a song, cannot only repeat the words and music correctly, but can imitate excellently the voice and expression of the singer.\n\nA baritone, he became best known for \"coon songs\" - stereotypical portrayals of African American life - although little regard was paid to the quality of the performances themselves. His popular recordings included \"Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow\" (1892), \"Dem Golden Slippers\" (1894), \"I Guess I'll Have To Telegraph My Baby\" (1899), and \"Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home?\" (1902).\n\nHe continued to record in the early years of the new century, but by 1920 worked as a deputy sheriff. He eventually became Inspector of Personnel for the Chicago Police. He died in Chicago in 1936 at the age of 76.\n\n"}
{"id": "87893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87893", "title": "Talk show", "text": "Talk show\n\nA talk show or chat show is a television programming or radio programming genre in which one person (or group of people) discusses various topics put forth by a talk show host.\n\nUsually, guests consist of a group of people who are learned or who have great experience in relation to whatever issue is being discussed on the show for that episode. Other times, a single guest discusses their work or area of expertise with a host or co-hosts. A call-in show takes live phone calls from callers listening at home, in their cars, etc. Sometimes, guests are already seated but are often introduced and enter from backstage. There have been many notable talk show hosts; in many cases, the shows have made their hosts famous.\n\nThere are several major formats of talk shows. Generally, each subgenre predominates during a specific programming block during the broadcast day.\n\n\nThese formats are not absolute. Syndicated \"daytime\" shows may appear overnight in some markets, and some afternoon programs have similar structures to late night talk shows.\n\nThese formats may vary across different countries or markets. Late night talk shows are especially significant in the United States. Breakfast television is a staple of British television. The daytime talk format has become popular in Latin America as well as the United States.\n\nTalk-radio host Howard Stern also hosted a talk show that was syndicated nationally in the USA, then moved to satellite radio's Sirius. The tabloid talk show genre, pioneered by Phil Donahue but popularized by Oprah Winfrey was extremely popular during the last two decades of the 20th century.\n\nPolitics are hardly the only subject of American talk shows, however. Other radio talk show subjects include \"Car Talk\" hosted by NPR and \"Coast to Coast AM\" hosted by Art Bell and George Noory which discusses topics of the paranormal, conspiracy theories, fringe science, and the just plain weird. Sports talk shows are also very popular ranging from high-budget shows like \"The Best Damn Sports Show Period\" to Max Kellerman's original public-access television cable TV show \"Max on Boxing\".\n\nTalk shows have been broadcast on television since the earliest days of the medium. Joe Franklin, an American radio and television personality, hosted the first television talk show. The show began in 1951 on WJZ-TV (later WABC-TV) and moved to WOR-TV (later WWOR-TV) from 1962 to 1993.\n\nNBC's \"The Tonight Show\" is the world's longest-running talk show; having debuted in 1954, it continues to this day. The show underwent some minor title changes until settling on its current title in 1962, and despite a brief foray into a more news-style program in 1957 and then reverting that same year, it has remained a talk show. Ireland's \"The Late Late Show\" is the second-longest running talk show in television history, and the longest running talk show in Europe, having debuted in 1962.\n\nSteve Allen was the first host of \"The Tonight Show\", which began as a local New York show, being picked up by the NBC network in 1954. It in turn had evolved from his late-night radio talk show in Los Angeles. Allen pioneered the format of late night network TV talk shows, originating such talk show staples as an opening monologue, celebrity interviews, audience participation, and comedy bits in which cameras were taken outside the studio, as well as music, although the series' popularity was cemented by second host Jack Paar, who took over after Allen had left and the show had ceased to exist.\nTV news pioneer Edward R. Murrow hosted a talk show entitled \"Small World\" in the late 1950s and since then, political TV talk shows have predominantly aired on Sunday mornings.\n\nSyndicated daily talk shows began to gain more popularity during the mid-1970s and reached their height of popularity with the rise of the tabloid talk show. Morning talk shows gradually replaced earlier forms of programming — there were a plethora of morning game shows during the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, and some stations formerly showed a morning movie in the time slot that many talk shows now occupy.\n\nCurrent late night talk shows such as \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Conan\" and \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" have aired featuring celebrity guests and comedy sketches. Syndicated daily talk shows range from tabloid talk shows, such as \"Jerry Springer\" and \"Maury\" to celebrity interview shows like \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", \"The Better Show\", \"The Wendy Williams Show\", and \"Ellen\" to industry leader \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" which popularized the former genre and has been evolving towards the latter. On November 10, 2010, Oprah Winfrey invited several of the most prominent American talk show hosts - Phil Donahue, Sally Jessy Raphael, Geraldo Rivera, Ricki Lake, and Montel Williams - to join her as guests on her show. The 1990s in particular saw a spike in the number of \"tabloid\" talk shows, most of which were short-lived and are now replaced by a more universally appealing \"interview\" or \"lifestyle TV\" format.\n\nTalk shows have more recently started to appear on Internet radio. Also, several Internet blogs are in talk show format including the Baugh Experience.\n\nThe current world record for the longest talk show is held by Rabi Lamichhane from Nepal by staying on air\nfor 62 hours from April 11 to 13, 2013 breaking the previous record set by two Ukrainians by airing the show for 52 hours in 2011.\n\nRabi Lamichhane from Nepal holds the present world record for longest ever talk show.\n\nIn Japan, panel shows — called \"tooku bangumi\" (トーク番組）in Japanese — are very commonplace, accounting for about 30% of daytime and prime-time programming on the four main television stations. Due to language and cultural differences, Japanese TV stations could not freely use syndicated programs (mostly from Europe and North America) and therefore turned to panel shows, which could be produced cheaply and easily, to fill time during daytime programming.\n\nJapanese panel shows are distinct in generally not employing regular panelists but instead having a panel made up of different freelance comedians and celebrities each program, although the program is generally hosted by the same compere. Talk shows evolved in tandem with the Japanese variety show and it is very common for talk shows to borrow variety elements, typically by having celebrity guests attempt some kind of amusingly incongruous activity. Often, one of the guests will be a gaijin tarento (foreign talent) in order to provide comedy or to comment on matters related to Western culture. Comedic material is commonly written and rehearsed before tapings with or without a live audience.\n\nKorean and Taiwanese talk shows have used the panel format similar to Japanese programs and rely on famous celebrities and comedic banter than topics. Their programs often shorten interviews from lengthy tapings.\n\nIn Brazil, Jô Soares inaugurated the genre with Jô Soares Onze e Meia (\"Jô Soares Eleven Thirty\") from 1988 to 1999. In 2000, Soares took his show's format to Rede Globo, where it was then called Programa do Jô, and hosts the program until the present day. Jô's main competitors are Danilo Gentili and Fábio Porchat.\nWeesibe Bbiri on Delta TV Uganda, hosted by Moses Wamala\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1129400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1129400", "title": "The Criterion Collection", "text": "The Criterion Collection\n\nThe Criterion Collection, Inc. (or simply Criterion) is an American home video distribution company which focuses on licensing \"important classic and contemporary films\" and selling them to film aficionados. Criterion is noted for helping to standardize a number of new ideas, such as the letterbox format for widescreen films, adding bonus features, commentary tracks, doing film restoration, and releasing special editions for home video.\n\nThe Criterion Collection company was founded in 1984 by Robert Stein, Aleen Stein, and Joe Medjuck, who later were joined by Roger Smith. In 1985, the Steins, William Becker, and Jonathan B. Turell founded the Voyager Company, to publish educational multimedia CD-ROMs (1989–2000), during which time the Criterion Collection became a subordinate division of the Voyager Company. In March 1994, Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH bought 20 percent of Voyager for US$6.7 million; the 4 founders each retained a 20 percent owner’s share.\n\nIn 1997, the Voyager Company was dissolved (Aleen Stein founded the Organa LLC CD-ROM publishing company), and Holtzbrinck Publishers sold the “Voyager” brand name, 42 CD-ROM titles, the Voyager web site, and associated assets, to Learn Technologies Interactive, LLC (LTI). Robert Stein sold 42 Voyager titles to LTI from his Voyager–Criterion company share. The remaining 3 partners, Aleen Stein, William Becker (President) and Jonathan Turell (CEO) owned the Criterion Collection company, which has a business partnership with Janus Films, and had one with Home Vision Entertainment (HVE) until 2005, when Image Entertainment bought HVE. On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment will now handle distribution.\n\nIn 1986, Charles Benton founded Home Vision Entertainment (HVE), the home-video division of Public Media Inc. (PMI), which he had previously founded in 1968. The HVE company sold, advertised, marketed, and distributed Criterion Collection DVDs, and also sold its own HVE brand of DVDs (co-produced with Criterion), including The Merchant Ivory Collection, and the Classic Collection, a joint venture between Home Vision Entertainment and Janus Films. The latter enterprise published HVE imprint films, for which Janus Films owned the video rights, but which were unavailable from the Criterion Collection; however, Criterion published the Classic Collection films. In 2005, Image Entertainment bought HVE, thus it became the exclusive distributor of Criterion Collection products until 2013.\n\nThe Criterion Collection began to provide video-on-demand (VOD) in partnership with \"MUBI\" (formerly \"The Auteurs\") in 2008. In February 2011, Criterion began switching its VOD offerings exclusively to Hulu Plus. In November 2016, FilmStruck, a film streaming service from Turner Classic Movies, succeeded Hulu as the then exclusive streaming service for the Criterion Collection. Some Criterion films were streamed by Kanopy. On October 26th, 2018, Warner Bros. Digital Networks and Turner announced that FilmStruck would be shutting down on November 29th due to a lack of subscribers. Criterion stated in a blog post that in wake of this, they were currently \"trying to find ways we can bring our library and original content back to the digital space as soon as possible.\" On November 16th, 2018, Criterion announced that they would be launching The Criterion Channel as a standalone service in Spring 2019 in partnership with WarnerMedia (the previous owners of FilmStruck). They also announced that the service will also be available through WarnerMedia's upcoming steaming platform when it launches in Q4 2019.\n\nCriterion also maintains a YouTube channel with which it markets its films. One notable feature is the \"Three Reasons\" playlist it has produced in which the company overlays in a few words or phrases three reasons, presumably, why the film is worth watching or has made it into the Criterion catalogue. In response, other users in YouTube have used the \"Three Reasons\" format to promote their own nominations. , no new \"Three Reasons\" video has been released by Criterion since June 30, 2015.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, British film magazine \"Sight & Sound\" revealed in their April 2016 issue that Criterion would be expanding its releases to the United Kingdom. The first six titles were released on April 18, 2016.\n\nCommercially, the Criterion Collection video company pioneered the correct aspect ratio letterboxing presentation of movies, as well as commentary soundtracks, multi-disc sets, special editions, and definitive versions. These ideas and the special features introduced by the Criterion Collection have been highly influential, and have become de facto industry-wide standards for premium home video releases.\n\nWith its eighth laserdisc release, \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", Criterion introduced the letterbox format, which added black bars to the top and bottom of the standard television set in order to preserve the original aspect ratio of the film. Thereafter, Criterion made letterboxing the standard presentation for all its releases of films shot in widescreen aspect ratios.\n\nThe Criterion Collection's second catalog title, \"King Kong\" (1933), was the debut of the scene-specific audio commentary contained in a separate analog channel of the laserdisc. It featured US film historian Ronald Haver reporting about the production, cast, screenplay, production design and special effects. He also is the commentator for the \"Casablanca\" (1942), \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\" (1941), \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952), and \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) laserdiscs. Typically, the chapter-indexed commentaries are exclusive to the Criterion releases and their initial DVD reissues; they became collector’s items when the original-owner studios re-issued titles previously licensed to Criterion (with newly produced commentary tracks or not).\n\nThe Criterion Collection began in 1984 with the releases of \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) and \"King Kong\" (1933) on laserdisc, the latter's source negatives courtesy of the Library of Congress. The company later became notable for pioneering the “special edition” DVD concept, containing bonus materials (trailers, commentaries, documentaries, alternate endings, deleted scenes, et cetera), \"a film school in a box\", as it were, the success of which established the special edition version in the DVD business. In 2006, taking advantage of better film-transfer and film-restoration technologies, Criterion published improved-image versions, with bonus materials, of early catalog titles such as \"Amarcord\" (1973), \"Brazil\" (1985), and \"Seven Samurai\" (1954).\n\nOriginally, the Criterion company released art, genre, and mainstream movies on laserdisc such as \"Halloween\" (1978), \"Ghostbusters\" (1984), \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992), \"Armageddon\" (1998) and \"The Rock\" (1996). Increasingly, the Criterion Collection has also focused on releasing world cinema, mainstream cinema classics, and critically successful obscure movies. Using the best available source materials, the company produced technologically improved and cleaner versions. For example, \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928), \"M\" (1931), \"Children of Paradise\" (1945), \"The Third Man\" (1949), \"Seven Samurai\" (1954) and \"Amarcord\" (1973) discs contain film-cleaning and film-restoration demonstrations, comparing the restored and un-restored images.\n\nSome previously licensed Criterion Collection titles, such as \"The Harder They Come\" (1972), are now commercially unavailable as new product, and are only available in resale (used) form. Titles such as \"RoboCop\" (1987), \"Hard Boiled\" (1992), \"The Killer\" (1989), and \"Ran\" (1985), became unavailable when their publishing licenses expired, or when Criterion published improved versions, such as \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1946), \"M\" (1931), \"Seven Samurai\" (1954), and \"The Wages of Fear\" (1954). As of September 2018, 188 of the 954 titles (19 percent) from the List of Criterion Collection Laserdisc releases have been re-released.\n\nAnother example is the film \"Charade\" (1963), which had become a public-domain property for lacking the legally required copyright notice. The Criterion company produced a digitally cleaned edition under license from Universal Pictures for the initial edition, and for the later anamorphic widescreen re-release edition of the film.\n\nPeriodically, Criterion does release material on DVD/Blu-ray licensed from the studios they previously dealt with, for example Sony, Fox, MGM/UA, Disney, and Universal; these new releases are generally done on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe Criterion Collection began publishing laserdiscs on December 1, 1984 with its release of \"Citizen Kane\". In 1998, Criterion began publishing DVDs as well. On March 16, 1999, Criterion issued its final laserdisc release, Michael Bay's \"Armageddon\". As with its laserdiscs, Criterion's early DVD editions of widescreen films were presented in the letterbox format, but Criterion did not enhance its discs for monitors until mid-1999 with its release of \"Insomnia\" (1997), catalog number 47.\n\nOn November 25, 2008, on its web site, Criterion began offering video-on-demand (VOD) downloading services, for US$5.00 per select movie, marking the beginning of a cross-promotional VOD service from the Criterion and The Auteurs web sites. In early 2011, many Criterion titles also became available through the Hulu Plus premium subscription service. In November 2016, FilmStruck, a film streaming service from Turner Classic Movies, succeeded Hulu as the exclusive streaming service for the Criterion Collection.\n\nCriterion began publishing on Blu-ray Disc in December 2008. Unlike its DVD releases, which are a mixture of NTSC-standard Region 0 (region-free) and Region 1 DVDs, Criterion Collection Blu-ray Discs are Region A locked.\n\nEclipse is a line started in 2007 separate from The Criterion Collection. It is described by Criterion as \"a selection of lost, forgotten, or overshadowed classics in simple, affordable editions\". They are sold in multi-DVD sets only.\n\nThe retail list prices for Criterion Collection releases typically range from US$30 to US$40 for one-disc and two-discs sets, respectively, while boxed sets typically range from US$80 to US$200. Twice-yearly sales at 50 percent off full price are held both at the Criterion website and at the Barnes & Noble website and stores.\n\nJanus Films' \"Essential Art House\" collection consists of Janus-owned Criterion movies without many special features, as lower-cost alternatives to individual purchases of regular Criterion titles.\n\nDemand for out-of-print Criterion Collection releases has spawned the business of counterfeit (bootleg) copies, often advertised as a Criterion Collection \"Asian\" edition to disguise their bootleg nature. The company’s website instructs buyers to shop carefully, advises about identifying bootleg merchandise, and notes that the Criterion Collection never published Asian editions of its movie catalog.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5437946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5437946", "title": "The Orion Conspiracy", "text": "The Orion Conspiracy\n\nThe Orion Conspiracy is a graphic adventure video game that was released in 1995. The game was published by Domark and developed by Divide By Zero. The game was released on MS-DOS and later the Microsoft Windows operating system.\n\nIn the year 2160, the universe is run by corrupt corporations and governments that will do anything in order to get what they want. On a space station, Devlin McCormack has just buried his estranged son, only to receive news afterwards that he was murdered. Devlin seeks to unravel the conspiracy behind his son's murder.\n\nThe game came with a 12-page comic book produced especially to be packaged with the game. It details the backstory of Devlin McCormack and his family. Devlin is the sole survivor of an attack on his ship during the Company Wars, sustaining permanent damage to his lungs due to smoke inhalation. Returning home and unable to work, (making him a social outcast in the company-centric colony) Devlin becomes severely depressed, combined with survivor's guilt. The toll of this drives his son Danny to leave home and become estranged from the family. Devlin's wife commits suicide shortly thereafter. The comic ends years later, with Devlin arriving at the space station for Danny's funeral.\n\nAn accident kills an engineer named Danny McCormack. While repairing a probe, an explosion sends his scout ship out of control and it falls into a nearby black hole. Soon Devlin McCormack arrives to attend the funeral on Cerberus. After the funeral, Devlin receives an anonymous tip that confirms his son was murdered. Devlin vows to kill whoever was responsible for this.\n\nThe base is shared by the staff of competing companies - Kobayashi (whom Danny worked for) and Mogami-Hudson. The leader of Kobayashi refuses to let a civilian stay on the station, so Devlin sabotages the navigation computer of one of the shuttles. This forces him to stay until a supply shuttle visits the station sometime in the coming weeks. Unable to gain access to Danny's possessions due to company policy, Devlin instead blackmails a senior officer to get them. He finds some love letters, which to his surprise show his son had a gay lover named Steve Kaufmann. Kaufmann walks in and angrily confronts Devlin over the destructive relationship Devlin had with his son before storming off.\n\nDevlin retires to his quarters for the night but awakes to find out Kaufmann has been murdered. As he was the last person to see him alive, Devlin is arrested and confined to the observatory (as the station lacks a proper brig). He escapes by cutting off the only air vent in the room, which tricks the computer into opening the door to restore the air supply.\n\nAfter escaping, Devlin discovers unusual eggs on a cargo shuttle. Doctor Chu walks in and reveals herself to be a shape-shifting alien responsible for placing the eggs, with a plan to replace the Cerberus crew and spread themselves throughout the galaxy. Devlin flees, but eventually kills the creature by igniting a fuel tank in the engine room.\n\nMaintenance Officer Meyer arrives after hearing the explosion and, afraid of being fired for incompetence, asks Devlin to keep the engine damage a secret so he can fix the problem without anyone ever knowing. Roland overhears the conversation from outside the room and attempts to escape on the transport, unwittingly carrying the alien eggs with him. Devlin is forced to break into the station's armoury and destroy the ship with Cerberus' laser cannon to prevent the aliens spreading throughout the galaxy.\n\nDevlin is then confronted by an armed and furious Captain Shannon. It turns out Shannon's wife served on Devlin's ship, which was destroyed in the Company Wars, and Shannon believes Devlin left her to die. Shannon arranged Danny's transfer to Cerberus station and sabotaged the probe to kill him, so that Devlin would feel the pain of losing a loved one just as he had. As Shannon is about to kill Devlin, Meyer jumps him from behind and Shannon is shot dead in the struggle.\n\nWhile this is happening, Ward is in an armed stand-off with the rest of the Kobayashi crew; he witnessed an alien changing from human form and went on a berserk rampage. Brooks impatiently attempts to snatch a grenade from Ward's hand which detonates, making the corridor unstable. Devlin and LaPaz retrieve Brooks' body and seal the corridor from the outside seconds before it de-pressurizes.\n\nThe engines on Cerberus need a replacement part which can only be found on the probe which killed Danny. Devlin flies out on a scout shuttle to retrieve the part but while he was out, Mogami-Hudson attempt to kill the aliens by cutting off all life-support on the station. (apart from inside their own labs) Devlin uses the shuttle to bomb Mogami-Hudson's power lines from the outside, returning control of the station to Kobayashi and devastating the Mogami-Hudson lab. Devlin goes looking for survivors and discovers a fatally wounded scientist; before dying, she admits they found the shape-shifting aliens within the asteroid and revived several of them.\n\nDevlin suggests evacuating the station, but Meyer points out the shuttle's navigation computer is still wiped. LaPaz reveals that the pilot (Brooks) has a backup stored in a chip inside her head, which is why LaPaz saved her corpse from being flushed out into space. While Devlin retrieves the chip, Meyer discovers a booby-trap on the shuttle intended for Devlin. Meyer needs time to disarm the trap, so Devlin and LaPaz hunt down and destroy one of the shape-shifters using a corrosive formula developed by Mogami-Hudson. The remaining two return to the shuttle, only for Meyer to tell them Lowe (who disappeared during the hunt) was a shape-shifter whom he had just fought off.\n\nSince Lowe could use the laser cannons to shoot down their craft as they try to leave, the survivors decide to activate the station's self-destruct as it will shut down all systems 30 seconds prior to detonation - including the laser cannons. Devlin sets the self-destruct and booby-traps the switch with a concussion charge. Lowe, attempting to override the self-destruct, is blown up and Devlin races back to the shuttle, which escapes the station as it explodes.\n\nThe game has a fullscreen, minimalistic interface. The game utilizes SVGA graphics combined with (new for the time) computer-generated cutscenes. In difference to traditional point 'n' click adventures of the time, verbs and actions are only shown when an object or character is clicked on, rather than being permanently displayed on screen. Verb or item icons that do not apply to the object are not displayed.\n\nThis design for interacting with objects is not implemented consistently, however. For example; if you have to give an item to a character at \"any\" point during the game, the 'Give' option will always be displayed regardless of whether or not you actually have the right item. However, if you have to use an item on something else, the option to use said item only appears once you have the item in question.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that \"this is quite simply a bad game. Unless you're desperate for a new science fiction adventure, give \"The Orion Conspiracy\" a miss.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "871053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=871053", "title": "Tom and Jerry", "text": "Tom and Jerry\n\nTom and Jerry is an American animated series of short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. It centers on a rivalry between its two title characters, Tom, a cat, and Jerry, a mouse, and many recurring characters, based around slapstick comedy.\n\nIn its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1940 to 1958. During this time, they won seven Academy Awards for Animated Short Film, tying for first place with Walt Disney's \"Silly Symphonies\" with the most awards in the category. After the MGM cartoon studio closed in 1957, MGM revived the series with Gene Deitch directing an additional 13 \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts for Rembrandt Films from 1961 to 1962. \"Tom and Jerry\" then became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, overtaking \"Looney Tunes\". Chuck Jones then produced another 34 shorts with Sib Tower 12 Productions between 1963 and 1967. Three more shorts were produced, \"\" in 2001, \"The Karate Guard\" in 2005, and \"A Fundraising Adventure\" in 2014, making a total of 164 shorts.\n\nA number of spin-offs have been made, including the television series \"The Tom and Jerry Show\" (1975), \"The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show\" (1980–82), \"Tom and Jerry Kids\" (1990–93), \"Tom and Jerry Tales\" (2006–08), and \"The Tom and Jerry Show\" (2014–present). The first feature-length film based on the series, \"\", was released in 1992, and 13 direct-to-video films have been produced since 2002.\n\nThe series features comic fights between an iconic set of adversaries, a house cat (Tom) and a mouse (Jerry). The plots of each short usually center on Tom's numerous attempts to capture Jerry and the mayhem and destruction that follows. Tom rarely succeeds in catching Jerry, mainly because of Jerry's cleverness, cunning abilities, and luck. However, there are also several instances within the cartoons where they display genuine friendship and concern for each other's well-being. At other times, the pair set aside their rivalry in order to pursue a common goal, such as when a baby escaped the watch of a negligent babysitter, causing Tom and Jerry to pursue the baby and keep it away from danger. And despite their endless attacks on one another, they’ve saved each other’s lives every time they were truly in danger.\n\nThe cartoons are known for some of the most violent cartoon gags ever devised in theatrical animation such as Tom using everything from axes, hammers, firearms, firecrackers, explosives, traps and poison to kill Jerry. On the other hand, Jerry's methods of retaliation are far more violent due to their frequent success, including slicing Tom in half, decapitating him, shutting his head or fingers in a window or a door, stuffing Tom's tail in a waffle iron or a mangle, kicking him into a refrigerator, getting him electrocuted, pounding him with a mace, club or mallet, letting a tree or electric pole drive him into the ground, sticking matches into his feet and lighting them, tying him to a firework and setting it off, and so on. Because of this, \"Tom and Jerry\" has often been criticized as excessively violent. Despite the frequent violence, there is no blood or gore in any scene.\n\nMusic plays a very important part in the shorts, emphasizing the action, filling in for traditional sound effects, and lending emotion to the scenes. Musical director Scott Bradley created complex scores that combined elements of jazz, classical, and pop music; Bradley often reprised contemporary pop songs, as well as songs from MGM films, including \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Meet Me in St. Louis\", which both starred Judy Garland in a leading role.\n\nGenerally, there is little dialogue as Tom and Jerry almost never speak; however, minor characters are not similarly limited, and the two lead characters are able to speak English on rare occasions and are thus not mute. For example, the character Mammy Two Shoes has lines in nearly every cartoon in which she appears. Most of the vocal effects used for Tom and Jerry are their high-pitched laughs and gasping screams.\n\nBefore 1954, all \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons were produced in the standard Academy ratio and format; in 1954 and 1955, some of the output was dually produced in dual versions: one Academy-ratio negative composed for a flat widescreen (1.75:1) format and one shot in the CinemaScope process. From 1955 until the close of the MGM cartoon studio a year later, all \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons were produced in CinemaScope, some even had their soundtracks recorded in Perspecta directional audio. All of the Hanna and Barbera cartoons were shot as successive color exposure negatives in Technicolor; the 1960s entries were done in Metrocolor. The 1960s entries also returned to the standard Academy ratio and format, too. The 2005 short \"The Karate Guard\" was also filmed in the standard Academy ratio and format.\n\nTom (named \"Jasper\" in his debut appearance) is a grey and white domestic shorthair cat. (\"Tom\" is a generic name for a male cat.) He is usually but not always, portrayed as living a comfortable, or even pampered life, while Jerry (named \"Jinx\" in his debut appearance) is a small, brown, house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom. Despite being very energetic, determined and much larger, Tom is no match for Jerry's wits. Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size, approximately the equivalent of Tom's, lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts. Although cats typically chase mice to eat them, it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to eat Jerry. Most of his attempts are just to torment or humiliate Jerry, sometimes in revenge, and sometimes to obtain a reward from a human for catching Jerry. By the final \"fade-out\" of each cartoon, Jerry usually emerges triumphant, while Tom is shown as the loser.\n\nHowever, other results may be reached. On rare occasions, Tom triumphs, usually when Jerry becomes the aggressor or he pushes Tom a little too far. In \"The Million Dollar Cat\" Jerry learns that Tom will lose his newly acquired wealth if he harms any animal, especially mice; he then torments Tom a little too much until he retaliates. In \"Timid Tabby\" Tom's look-alike cousin pushes Jerry over the edge. Occasionally and usually ironically, they both lose, usually because Jerry's last trap or attack on Tom backfires on him or he overlooks something. In Chuck Jones' \"Filet Meow\", Jerry orders a shark from the pet store to scare Tom away from eating a goldfish. Afterwards, the shark scares Jerry away as well. Finally, they occasionally end up being friends, although within this set of stories, there is often a last minute event that ruins the truce. One cartoon that has a friendly ending is \"Snowbody Loves Me\".\n\nBoth characters display sadistic tendencies, in that they are equally likely to take pleasure in tormenting each other, although it is often in response to a triggering event. However, when one character appears to truly be in mortal danger from an unplanned situation or due to actions by a third party, the other will develop a conscience and save him. Occasionally, they bond over a mutual sentiment towards an unpleasant experience and their attacking each other is more play than serious attacks. Multiple shorts show the two getting along with minimal difficulty, and they are more than capable of working together when the situation calls for it, usually against a third party who manages to torture and humiliate them both. Sometimes this partnership is forgotten quickly when an unexpected event happens, or when one character feels that the other is no longer necessary. This is the case in Posse Cat, when they agree that Jerry will allow himself to be caught if Tom agrees to share his reward dinner, but Tom then reneges. Other times however, Tom does keep his promise to Jerry and the partnerships are not quickly dissolved after the problem is solved.\n\nTom changes his love interest many times. The first love interest is Toots who appears in \"Puss n' Toots\", and calls him \"Tommy\" in \"The Mouse Comes to Dinner\". He is also interested in a cat called Toots in \"The Zoot Cat\" although she has a different appearance to the original Toots. The most frequent love interest of Tom's is Toodles Galore, who never has any dialogue in the cartoons.\n\nDespite five shorts ending with a depiction of Tom's apparent death, his demise is never permanent; he even reads about his own death in a flashback in \"Jerry's Diary\". He appears to die in explosions in \"Mouse Trouble\" (after which he is seen in heaven), \"Yankee Doodle Mouse\" and in \"Safety Second\", while in \"The Two Mouseketeers\" he is guillotined offscreen. The short \"Blue Cat Blues\" ends with both Tom and Jerry sitting on the railroad tracks with the intent of suicide while the whistle of an oncoming train is heard foreshadowing their imminent death.\n\nAlthough many supporting and minor characters speak, rarely do Tom and Jerry so themselves. Tom, most famously, sings while wooing female cats; for example, Tom sings Louis Jordan's \"Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby\" in the 1946 short \"Solid Serenade\". In that one as well as \"Zoot Cat\", Tom, when romancing a female cat, woos her in a French-accented voice similar to that of screen actor Charles Boyer. At the end of \"The Million Dollar Cat\" after beginning to antagonize Jerry he says, \"Gee, I'm throwin' away a million dollars... BUT I'M HAPPY!\" In \"\", Jerry says, \"No, no, no, no, no,\" when choosing the shop to remove his ring. In \"The Mouse Comes to Dinner\" Tom speaks to his girlfriend Toots while inadvertently sitting on a stove: \"Say, what's cookin'?\", to which Toots replies \"You are, stupid.\" Another instance of speech comes in \"Solid Serenade\" and \"The Framed Cat\", where Tom directs Spike through a few dog tricks in a dog-trainer manner. Co-director William Hanna provided most of the squeaks, gasps, and other vocal effects for the pair, including the most famous sound effects from the series, Tom's leather-lunged scream (created by recording Hanna's scream and eliminating the beginning and ending of the recording, leaving only the strongest part of the scream on the soundtrack) and Jerry's nervous gulp.\n\nThe only other reasonably common vocalization is made by Tom when some external reference claims a certain scenario or eventuality to be impossible, which inevitably, ironically happens to thwart Tom's plans – at which point, a bedraggled and battered Tom appears and says in a haunting, echoing voice \"Don't you believe it!\", a reference to the then-popular 1940s radio show \"Don't You Believe It.\" In \"Mouse Trouble\", Tom says \"Don't you believe it!\" after being beaten up by Jerry (this also happens in \"The Missing Mouse\"). In the 1946 short \"Trap Happy\", Tom hires a cat disguised as a mouse exterminator who, after several failed attempts to dispatch Jerry, changes profession to \"Cat\" exterminator by crossing out the \"Mouse\" on his title and writing \"Cat\", resulting in Tom spelling out the word out loud before reluctantly pointing at himself. One short, 1956's \"Blue Cat Blues\", is narrated by Jerry in voiceover (voiced by Paul Frees) as they try to win back their ladyfriends. Both Tom and Jerry speak more than once in the 1943 short \"The Lonesome Mouse\", while Jerry was voiced by Sara Berner during his appearance in the 1945 MGM musical \"Anchors Aweigh\". \"\" is the first (and so far only) installment of the series where the famous cat-and-mouse duo regularly speak. In that movie, Tom was voiced by Richard Kind, and Jerry was voiced by Dana Hill.\n\nIn his attempts to catch Jerry, Tom often has to deal with Spike (known as \"Killer\" and \"Butch\" in some shorts), an angry, vicious but easily duped bulldog who tries to attack Tom for bothering him or his son Tyke while trying to get Jerry. Originally, Spike was unnamed and mute (aside from howls and biting noises) as well as attacking indiscriminately, not caring whether it was Tom or Jerry though usually attacking Tom. In later cartoons, Spike spoke often, using a voice and expressions (performed by Billy Bletcher and later Daws Butler) modeled after comedian Jimmy Durante. Spike's coat has altered throughout the years between grey and creamy tan. The addition of Spike's son Tyke in the late 1940s led to both a slight softening of Spike's character and a short-lived spin-off theatrical series (\"Spike and Tyke\").\n\nMost cartoons with Spike in it have a system; usually Spike is trying to accomplish something (such as building a dog house or sleeping) when Tom and Jerry's antics stop him from doing it. Spike then (presumably due to prejudice) singles out Tom as the culprit and threatens him that if it ever happens again, he will do \"something horrible\" to him (effectively forcing Tom to take the blame) while Jerry overhears; afterwards Jerry usually does anything he can to interrupt whatever Spike is doing while Tom barely manages to stop him (usually getting injured in the process). Usually Jerry does eventually wreck whatever Spike is doing in spectacular fashion and leaving Tom to take the blame, forcing him to flee from Spike and inevitably lose (usually due to the fact that Tom is usually framed by Jerry and that Spike just doesn't like Tom). Off-screen, Spike does something to Tom and finally Tom is generally shown injured or in a bad situation while Jerry smugly cuddles up to Spike unscathed. Tom sometimes can get irritated with Spike on some occasions (example is in That's My Pup!, when Spike forced Tom to run up a tree every time his son barked, causing Tom to hang Tyke on a flag pole). At least once however, Tom does something that benefits Spike, who promises not to interfere ever again; causing Jerry to frantically leave the house and run into the distance (in Hic-cup Pup). Spike is well known for his famous \"\"Listen pussycat!\" catchphrase when he threatens Tom, his other famous catchphrase is \"That's my boy!\"\" normally said when he supports or congratulates his son.\n\nTyke is described as a cute, sweet looking, happy and a lovable puppy. He is Spike's son, but unlike Spike, Tyke does not speak and only communicates (mostly towards his father) by barking, yapping, wagging his tail, whimpering and growling. Tyke's father Spike would always go out of his way to care and comfort his son and make sure that he is safe from Tom. Tyke loves his father and Spike loves his son and they get along like friends, although most of time they would be taking a nap or Spike would teach Tyke the main facts of life of being a dog. Like Spike, Tyke's appearance has altered throughout the years, from grey (with white paws) to creamy tan. When Tom and Jerry Kids first aired, this was the first time that viewers were able to hear Tyke speak.\n\nButch is a black, cigar-smoking cat who also wants to eat Jerry. He is the most frequent adversary of Tom. However, for most of the episodes he appears in, he is usually seen rivaling Tom over Toodles. Butch was also Tom's chum as in some cartoons, where Butch is leader of Tom's alley cat buddies, who are mostly Lightning, Topsy, and Meathead. Butch talks more often than Tom or Jerry in most shorts.\n\nBoth characters were originally introduced in Hugh Harman's 1941 short \"The Alley Cat\", but were integrated into \"Tom and Jerry\" rather than continuing in their own series.\n\nNibbles is a small grey mouse who often appears in shorts as Jerry's nephew. He is a carefree individual who very rarely understands the danger of the situation, simply following instructions the best he can both to Jerry's command and his own innocent understanding of the situation. This can lead to such results as \"getting the cheese\" by simply asking Tom to pick it up for him, rather than following Jerry's example of outmaneuvering and sneaking around Tom. Many times Nibbles is an ally of Jerry in fights against Tom, including being the second Mouseketeer. He is given speaking roles in all his appearances as a Mouseketeer, often with a high-pitched French tone. However, during a short in which he rescued Robin Hood, his voice was instead more masculine, gruff, and cockney accented.\n\nMammy Two Shoes is a heavy-set middle-aged mammy who often has to deal with the mayhem generated by the lead characters. Voiced by character actress Lillian Randolph, she is often seen as the owner of Tom. Her face was only shown once, very briefly, in \"Saturday Evening Puss\". Mammy's appearances have often been edited out, dubbed, or re-animated as a slim white woman in later television showings, since her character is a mammy archetype now often regarded as racist. She was mostly restored in the DVD releases of the cartoons, with an introduction by Whoopi Goldberg explaining the importance of African-American representation in the cartoon series, however stereotyped.\n\n\"Tom and Jerry\" was a commonplace phrase for youngsters indulging in riotous behaviour in 19th-century London. The term comes from \"Life in London, or Days and Nights of Jerry Hawthorne and his elegant friend Corinthian Tom\" (1823) by Pierce Egan. However Brewer notes no more than an \"unconscious\" echo of the Regency era original in the naming of the cartoon.\n\nWilliam Hanna and Joseph Barbera were both part of the Rudolf Ising unit at the MGM cartoon studio in the late 1930s. After the financial disaster of a series of MGM cartoons based upon the \"Captain and the Kids\" comic strip characters, Barbera, a storyman and character designer, was paired (out of desperation) with Hanna, an experienced director, to start directing films for the Ising unit. In their first discussion for a cartoon, Barbera suggested a cat-and-mouse cartoon titled \"Puss Gets the Boot\". \"We knew we needed two characters. We thought we needed conflict, and chase and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought,\" as he recalled in an interview. Hanna and other employees complained that the idea wasn't very original; nevertheless, the short was completed in late 1939, and released to theaters on February 10, 1940. \"Puss Gets The Boot\" centers on Jasper, a gray tabby cat trying to catch a mouse named Jinx (whose name is not mentioned within the cartoon itself), but after accidentally breaking a houseplant and its stand, the African American housemaid Mammy has threatened to throw Jasper out if he breaks one more thing in the house. Naturally, Jinx uses this to his advantage, and begins tossing any and everything fragile, so that Jasper will be thrown outside. \"Puss Gets The Boot\" was previewed and released without fanfare, and Hanna and Barbera went on to direct other non-cat-and-mouse related shorts such as \"Gallopin' Gals\" (1940) and \"Officer Pooch\" (1941). \"After all,\" remarked many of the MGM staffers, \"haven't there been enough cat-and-mouse cartoons already?\"\n\nThe pessimistic attitude towards the cat and mouse duo changed when the cartoon became a favorite with theater owners and with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which nominated the film for the \"Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons\" of 1941. It lost to another MGM cartoon, Rudolph Ising's \"The Milky Way\".\n\nProducer Fred Quimby, who ran the MGM animation studio, quickly pulled Hanna and Barbera off the other one-shot cartoons they were working on, and commissioned a series featuring the cat and mouse. Hanna and Barbera held an intra-studio contest to give the pair a new name by drawing suggested names out of a hat; animator John Carr won $50 with his suggestion of \"Tom and Jerry\", at the time best known as the name of a Christmastime mixed drink. The \"Tom and Jerry\" series went into production with \"The Midnight Snack\" in 1941, and Hanna and Barbera rarely directed anything but the cat-and-mouse cartoons for the rest of their tenure at MGM. Barbera would create the story for each short while Hanna would supervise production.\n\nTom's physical appearance evolved significantly over the years. During the early 1940s, Tom had an excess of detail—shaggy fur, numerous facial wrinkles, and multiple eyebrow markings, all of which were streamlined into a more workable form by the end of the 1940s. In addition, he also looked like a more realistic cat early on; evolving from his quadrupedal beginnings Tom to become increasingly and almost exclusively bipedal. By contrast, Jerry's design remained essentially the same for the duration of the series. By the mid-1940s, the series had developed a quicker, more energetic and violent tone, due to the inspiration from the work of their colleague in the MGM cartoon studio, Tex Avery, who joined the studio in 1942.\n\nEven though the theme of each short is virtually the same – cat chases mouse – Hanna and Barbera found endless variations on that theme. Barbera's storyboards and rough layouts and designs, combined with Hanna's timing, resulted in MGM's most popular and successful cartoon series. Thirteen entries in the \"Tom and Jerry\" series (including \"Puss Gets The Boot\") were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons; seven of them went on to win the Academy Award, breaking the Disney studio's winning streak in that category. \"Tom and Jerry\" won more Academy Awards than any other character-based theatrical animated series.\n\n\"Tom and Jerry\" remained popular throughout their original theatrical run, even when the budgets began to tighten in the 1950s and the pace of the shorts slowed slightly. However, after television became popular in the 1950s, box office revenues decreased for theatrical films, and short subjects. At first, MGM combated this by going to all-CinemaScope production on the series. After MGM realized that their re-releases of the older cartoons brought in just as much money as the new cartoons did, the studio executives decided, much to the surprise of the staff, to close the animation studio. The MGM cartoon studio was shut down on May 15, 1957, and the last of the 114 Hanna-Barbera \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts, \"Tot Watchers\", was released on August 1, 1958. Hanna and Barbera established their own television animation studio, Hanna-Barbera Productions, on July 7, 1957, which went on to produce hit TV shows, such as \"The Flintstones\", \"Yogi Bear\", \"The Jetsons\" and Scooby-Doo.\n\nIn 1961, MGM revived the \"Tom and Jerry\" franchise, and contracted European animation studio Rembrandt Films to produce 13 \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts in Prague, Czechoslovakia. All were directed by Gene Deitch and produced by William L. Snyder. Deitch himself wrote most of the cartoons, with occasional assistance from Larz Bourne and Eli Bauer. Stěpan Koniček provided the musical score for the Deitch shorts. Sound effects were produced by electronic music composer Tod Dockstader. The majority of vocal effects and voices in Deitch's films were provided by Allen Swift.\n\nDeitch states that, being a \"UPA man\", he was not a fan of the \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons, thinking they were \"needlessly violent\". However, after being assigned to work on the series, he quickly realized that \"nobody took [the violence] seriously\", and it was merely \"a parody of exaggerated human emotions\". He also came to see what he perceived as the \"biblical roots\" in Tom and Jerry's conflict, similar to David and Goliath, stating \"That's where we feel a connection to these cartoons: the little guy can win (or at least survive) to fight another day.\"\n\nSince the Deitch/Snyder team had seen only a handful of the original \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts, and since the team produced their cartoons on a tighter budget of $10,000, the resulting films were considered surrealist in nature, though this was not Deitch's intention. The animation was limited and jerky in movement, compared to the more fluid Hanna-Barbera shorts. Background art was done in a more simplistic, angular, Art Deco-esque style. The soundtracks featured sparse and echoic electronic music, futuristic sound effects, heavy reverb, and dialogue that was mumbled rather than spoken. According to Jen Nessel of \"The New York Times\", \"The Czech style had nothing in common with these gag-driven cartoons.\"\n\nWhereas Hanna-Barbera's shorts generally took place in and outside of a house, Deitch's shorts opted for more exotic locations, such as a 19th-century whaling ship, the jungles of Nairobi, an Ancient Greek acropolis, or the Wild West. In addition, Mammy Two-Shoes was replaced as Tom's owner by Clint Clobber, a bald, overweight, short-tempered, middle-aged white man who was also much more brutal and violent in punishing Tom's actions as compared to previous owners, by beating and thrashing Tom repeatedly, stomping on his hand, searing his head with a grill, forcing him to drink an entire carbonated beverage, slamming his fingers with a lunchbox lid and even wrapping a shotgun over his head and firing it.\n\nTo avoid being linked to Communism, Deitch romanized the Czech names of his crew in the opening credits of the shorts (e.g. Stêpan Koniček became \"Steven Konichek\" and Vaclav Lidl became \"Victor Little\"). In addition, these shorts are among the few \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons not to carry the \"Made In Hollywood, U.S.A.\" phrase on the end title card; due to Deitch's studio being behind the Iron Curtain, the production studio's location is omitted entirely on it. After the 13 shorts were completed, Joe Vogel, the head of production, was fired from MGM. Vogel had approved of Deitch and his team's work, but MGM decided not to renew their contract after Vogel's departure. The final of the 13 shorts, \"Carmen Get It!\", was released on December 21, 1962.\n\nDeitch's shorts were commercial successes. In 1961, the \"Tom and Jerry\" series became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, dethroning \"Looney Tunes\", which had held the position for 16 years; this success was repeated once more in 1962. However, unlike the Hanna-Barbera shorts, none of Deitch's films were nominated for nor did they win an Academy Award. In retrospect, these shorts are often considered the worst of the \"Tom and Jerry\" theatrical output. Deitch stated that due to his team's inexperience as well as their low budget, he \"hardly had a chance to succeed\", and \"well understand[s] the negative reactions\" to his shorts. He believes \"They could all have been better animated – truer to the characters – but our T&Js were produced in the early 1960s, near the beginning of my presence here, over a half-century ago as I write this!\" Despite the criticism, some fans wrote positive letters to Deitch, stating that his \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts were their personal favorites due to their quirky and surreal nature. The shorts were released on DVD in 2015 in .\n\nAfter the last of the Deitch cartoons were released, Chuck Jones, who had been fired from his 30-plus year tenure at Warner Bros. Cartoons, started his own animation studio, Sib Tower 12 Productions (later renamed MGM Animation/Visual Arts), with partner Les Goldman. Beginning in 1963, Jones and Goldman went on to produce , all of which carried Jones' distinctive style (and a slight psychedelic influence).\n\nJones had trouble adapting his style to \"Tom and Jerry\"'s brand of humor, and a number of the cartoons favored full animation, personality and style over storyline. The characters underwent a slight change of appearance: Tom was given thicker eyebrows (resembling Jones' Grinch, Count Blood Count or Wile E. Coyote), a less complex look (including the color of his fur becoming gray), sharper ears, longer tail and furrier cheeks (resembling Jones' Claude Cat or Sylvester), while Jerry was given larger eyes and ears, a lighter brown color, and a sweeter, Porky Pig-like expression.\n\nSome of Jones' \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons are reminiscent of his work with Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, included the uses of blackout gags and gags involving characters falling from high places. Jones co-directed the majority of the shorts with layout artist Maurice Noble. The remaining shorts were directed by Abe Levitow and Ben Washam, with Tom Ray directing two shorts built around footage from earlier \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons directed by Hanna and Barbera, and Jim Pabian directed a short with Maurice Noble. Various vocal characteristics were made by Mel Blanc and June Foray. These shorts contain a memorable opening theme, in which Tom first replaces the MGM lion, then is trapped inside the \"O\" of his name.\n\nThough Jones's shorts were generally considered an improvement over Deitch's, they nevertheless had varying degrees of critical success. MGM ceased production of \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts in 1967, by which time Jones had moved on to television specials and the feature film \"The Phantom Tollbooth\". The shorts were released on DVD in 2009 in .\n\nBeginning in 1965, the Hanna and Barbera \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons began to appear on television in heavily edited versions. The Jones team was required to take the cartoons featuring Mammy Two Shoes and remove her by pasting over the scenes featuring her with new scenes. Most of the time, she was replaced with a similarly fat white Irish woman; occasionally, as in \"Saturday Evening Puss\", a thin white teenager took her place instead, with both characters voiced by June Foray. However, recent telecasts on Cartoon Network and Boomerang retain Mammy with new voiceover work performed by Thea Vidale to remove the stereotypical black jargon featured on the original cartoon soundtracks. The standard \"Tom and Jerry\" opening titles were removed as well. Instead of the roaring MGM Lion sequence, an opening sequence featuring different clips of the cartoons was used instead. The title cards were also changed. A pink title card with the name written in white font was used instead.\n\nDebuting on CBS' Saturday morning schedule on September 25, 1965, \"Tom and Jerry\" moved to CBS Sundays two years later and remained there until September 17, 1972.\n\nIn 1975, Tom and Jerry were reunited with Hanna and Barbera, who produced new \"Tom and Jerry cartoons\" for Saturday mornings. These 48 seven-minute short cartoons were paired with \"Grape Ape\" and \"Mumbly\" cartoons, to create \"The Tom and Jerry/Grape Ape Show\", \"The Tom and Jerry/Grape Ape/Mumbly Show\", and \"The Tom and Jerry/Mumbly Show\", all of which initially ran on ABC Saturday mornings between September 6, 1975 and September 3, 1977. In these cartoons, Tom and Jerry (now with a red bow tie), who had been enemies during their formative years, became nonviolent pals who went on adventures together, as Hanna-Barbera had to meet the stringent rules against violence for children's TV. This 1975-styled format was no longer used in the newer Tom and Jerry entrees.\n\nFilmation Studios (in association with MGM Television) also tried their hands at producing a \"Tom and Jerry\" TV series. Their version, \"The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show\", debuted in 1980, and also featured new cartoons starring Droopy, Spike (from Tom & Jerry, and the same version also used in Droopy), Slick Wolf, and Barney Bear, not seen since the original MGM shorts. The Filmation \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons were noticeably different from Hanna-Barbera's efforts, as they returned \"Tom and Jerry\" to the original chase formula, with a somewhat more \"slapstick\" humor format. This incarnation, much like the 1975 version, was not as well received by audiences as the originals, and lasted on CBS Saturday mornings from September 6, 1980 to September 4, 1982.\n\nIn 1986, MGM was purchased by WTBS founder Ted Turner. Turner sold the company a short while later, but retained MGM's pre-1986 film library, thus \"Tom and Jerry\" became the property of Turner Entertainment Co. (where the rights stand today via Warner Bros.), and have in subsequent years appeared on Turner-run stations, such as TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, The WB, Boomerang, and Turner Classic Movies.\n\nOne of the biggest trends for Saturday morning television in the 1980s and 1990s was the child versions of famous classic cartoon stars \"babyfication\" of older, classic cartoon stars, and on March 2, 1990, \"Tom and Jerry Kids\", co-produced by Turner Entertainment Co. and Hanna-Barbera Productions (which would be sold to Turner in 1991) debuted on Fox Kids and for a few years, aired on British children's block, CBBC. It featured a youthful version of the famous cat-and-mouse duo chasing each other. As with the 1975 H-B series, Jerry wears his red bowtie, while Tom now wears a red cap. Spike and his son Tyke (who now had talking dialogue) and Droopy and his son Dripple, appeared in back-up segments for the show, which ran until November 18, 1994. \"Tom and Jerry Kids\" was the last Tom and Jerry cartoon series produced in 4:3 (full screen) aspect ratio.\n\nIn 2001, a new television special titled \"\" premiered on Boomerang. It featured Joe Barbera (who was also a creative consultant) as the voice of Tom's owner, whose face is never seen. In this cartoon, Jerry, housed in a habitrail, is as much of a house pet as Tom is, and their owner has to remind Tom to not \"blame everything on the mouse\".\n\nIn 2005, a new Tom and Jerry theatrical short, titled \"The Karate Guard\", which had been written and directed by Barbera and Spike Brandt, storyboarded by Joseph Barbera and Iwao Takamoto and produced by Joseph Barbera, Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone premiered in Los Angeles cinemas on September 27, 2005. As part of the celebration of \"Tom and Jerry\"s sixty-fifth anniversary, this marked Barbera's first return as a writer, director and storyboard artist on the series since his and Hanna's original MGM cartoon shorts, and last overall; he would die shortly after production ended. Director/animator, Spike Brandt was nominated for an Annie award for best character animation. The short debuted on Cartoon Network on January 27, 2006.\n\nDuring the first half of 2006, a new series called \"Tom and Jerry Tales\" was produced at Warner Bros. Animation. Thirteen half-hour episodes (each consisting of three shorts, some of them—like \"The Karate Guard\"—were produced and completed in 2003 as part of a 30-plus theatrical cartoon schedule aborted after the financial disaster of \"\") were produced, with only markets outside of the United States and United Kingdom signed up. The show then came to the UK in February 2006 on Boomerang, and it went to the U.S. on Kids' WB on The CW. \"Tales\" is the first \"Tom and Jerry\" TV series that utilizes the original style of the classic shorts, along with the slapstick. The series was canceled in 2008, shortly before the Kids' WB block shut down. \"Tales\" is also the first \"Tom and Jerry\" production presented in 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio (which was aired on Cartoon Network in the United States) but cropped to 4:3 fullscreen aspect ratio (which was aired on The CW and Boomerang in the United States).\n\nCartoon Network, which began rerunning the \"Tom and Jerry Tales\" in January 2012, subsequently aired a second series consisting of two 11-minute shorts per episode that likewise sought to maintain the look, core characters and sensibility of the original theatrical shorts. Similar to other reboot works like \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" and \"The Looney Tunes Show\", several episodes the new series brought Tom and Jerry into contemporary environments, telling new stories and relocating the characters to more fantastic worlds, from a medieval castle to a mad scientist's lab. Titled \"The Tom and Jerry Show\", the series is produced by Warner Bros. Animation, with Sam Register serving as executive producer in collaboration with Darrell Van Citters and Ashley Postelwaite at Renegade Animation. Originally slated for an undated 2013 Cartoon Network premiere before being pushed back to April 9, 2014, this is the second \"Tom and Jerry\" production presented in 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio.\n\nIn November 2014, a two-minute sketch was shown as part of the Children In Need Telethon in the United Kingdom, the sketch was produced as a collaboration with Warner Bros.\n\nWhen shown on terrestrial television in the United Kingdom (from 1967 to 2000, usually on the BBC) \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons were not edited for violence, and Mammy was retained. As well as having regular slots (mainly after the evening BBC News with around two shorts shown every evening and occasionally shown on children's network CBBC in the morning), \"Tom and Jerry\" served the BBC in another way. When faced with disruption to the schedules (such as those occurring when live broadcasts overrun), the BBC would invariably turn to \"Tom and Jerry\" to fill any gaps, confident that it would retain much of an audience that might otherwise channel hop. This proved particularly helpful in 1993, when \"Noel's House Party\" had to be cancelled due to an IRA bomb scare at BBC Television Centre—\"Tom and Jerry\" was shown instead, bridging the gap until the next programme. In 2006, a mother complained to OFCOM of the smoking scenes shown in the cartoons, since Tom often attempts to impress love interests with the habit, resulting in reports that the smoking scenes in \"Tom and Jerry\" films may be subject to censorship.\n\nDue to its lack of dialogue, \"Tom and Jerry\" was easily translated into various foreign languages. \"Tom and Jerry\" began broadcast in Japan in 1965. A 2005 nationwide survey taken in Japan by TV Asahi, sampling age groups from teenagers to adults in their sixties, ranked \"Tom and Jerry\" #85 in a list of the top 100 \"anime\" of all time; while their web poll taken after the airing of the list ranked it at #58 – the only non-Japanese animation on the list, and beating anime classics like \"\", \"A Little Princess Sara\", and the ultra-classics \"Macross\" and \"Ghost in the Shell\" (in Japan, the word \"anime\" refers to \"all\" animation regardless of origin, not just Japanese animation). \"Tom and Jerry\" also serve as long-time licensed mascots for Gifu-based Juroku Bank.\nUnlike some other Western cartoons such as \"Bob the Builder\" and \"Postman Pat\", whose characters had to be doctored to have five fingers in each hand instead of the original four, \"Tom and Jerry\" aired in Japan without such edits, as did other series starring non-human protagonists such as \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\n\n\"Tom and Jerry\" have long since been popular in Germany. The different shorts are usually linked together with key scenes from \"Jerry's Diary\" (1949), in which Tom reads about his and Jerry's past adventures. The cartoons are introduced with rhyming German language verse, and when necessary, a German voice spoke the translations of English labels on items and similar information.\n\nThe show was aired in mainland China by CCTV in the mid-1980s to early 1990s, and was extremely popular at the time. Collections of the show are still a prominent feature in Chinese book stores. \n\nIn the Philippines, the series was aired on ABS-CBN from 1966 until its closure due to the country's declaration of martial law in 1972, with the later Hanna-Barbera shorts from Barbecue Brawl to Tot Watchers and all of Gene Deitch and Chuck Jones shorts. RPN aired most of Hanna-Barbera shorts from 1977 until 1989. ABS-CBN would later return to the air after the restoration of democracy in 1986 and airing the same shorts as in the pre-martial law era and lasted until the end of 1988.\n\nEven though Gene Deitch's shorts were created in Czechoslovakia (1960–1962), the first official TV release of \"Tom and Jerry\" was in 1988. It was one of the few cartoons of western origin broadcast in Czechoslovakia (1988) and Romania (until 1989) before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.\n\nThe Pakistani ice cream brand OMORÉ has launched a chocolate bar ice cream based on the show.\n\nTom and Jerry's first feature film appearance was in the 1945 MGM musical \"Anchors Aweigh\", in which Jerry performs a dance number with Gene Kelly. In this scene, Tom also made a cameo as a servant. Filmmakers had wanted Mickey Mouse for the scene, but Roy Disney had rejected the deal, as the Disney studio was focusing on its own cartoons to help pay off its debts after World War II. William Hanna and Joe Barbera supervised animation for the scene.\n\nTom and Jerry's second feature film appearance was swimming with Esther Williams in a dream sequence in another MGM big-screen musical, \"Dangerous When Wet\" (1953).\n\nOn October 1, 1992, the first international release of \"\" arrived when the film was released overseas to theaters in Europe and then domestically by Miramax Films on July 30, 1993, with future video and DVD releases that would be sold under Warner Bros., which, following Disney's acquisition of Miramax and Turner's subsequent merger with Time Warner, had acquired the film's distribution rights. Barbera served as creative consultant for the picture, which was produced and directed by Phil Roman. The film was a musical with a structure similar to MGM's blockbusters, \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Singin' in the Rain\". In 2001, Warner Bros. (which had, by then, merged with Turner and assumed its properties) released the duo's first direct-to-video movie, \"\", in which Tom covets a ring that grants mystical powers to the wearer, and has become accidentally stuck on Jerry's head. It would mark the last time Hanna and Barbera co-produced a \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon together, as William Hanna died shortly after \"The Magic Ring\" was released.\n\nFour years later, Bill Kopp scripted and directed two more \"Tom and Jerry\" DTV features for the studio, \"\" and \"\", the latter one based on a story by Barbera. Both were released on DVD in 2005, marking the celebration of Tom and Jerry's 65th anniversary. In 2006, another direct-to-video film, \"\", tells the story about the pair having to work together to find the treasure. Joe came up with the storyline for the next film, \"\", as well as the initial idea of synchronizing the on-screen actions to music from Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker Suite\". This DTV film, directed by Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone, would be Joe Barbera's last \"Tom and Jerry\" project due to his death in December 2006. The holiday-set animated film was released on DVD in late 2007, and dedicated to Barbera. A new direct-to-video film, \"Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes\", was released on August 24, 2010. It is the first made-for-video Tom and Jerry movie produced without any of the characters' original creators. The next direct-to-video film, \"Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz\", was released on August 23, 2011 and was the first made-for-video Tom and Jerry movie made for Blu-ray. It had a preview showing on Cartoon Network. \"\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 2, 2012. \"Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure\" was released in 2013 on Blu-ray and DVD. \"\" was released on DVD on September 2, 2014. \"\" was released on DVD on June 23, 2015. \"\" was released on DVD on June 21, 2016. \"\" was released on DVD on July 11, 2017.\n\nOn April 6, 2015, a new theatrical feature film was announced. It was originally going to be completely animated and were \"in the same vein\" as the source material. Cate Adams and Jesse Ehrman were oversee the movie. However, in October 2018, it was announced that it will instead be a live action/animated hybrid film.\n\nLike many animated cartoons from the 1930s to the early 1950s, \"Tom and Jerry\" featured racial stereotypes.\nAfter explosions, for example, characters with blasted faces would resemble stereotypical blacks, with large lips and bow-tied hair. Perhaps the most controversial element of the show is the character Mammy Two Shoes, a poor black maid who speaks in a stereotypical \"black accent\" and has a rodent problem. Joseph Barbera, who was responsible for these gags, claimed that the racial gags in \"Tom and Jerry\" did not reflect his racial opinion; they were just reflecting what was common in society and cartoons at the time and were meant to be humorous. Today, the blackface gags are often censored when these shots are aired. Mammy Two-Shoes' voice was re-dubbed by Turner in the mid-1990s to make the character sound less stereotypical; the resulting accent sounds more Irish. Three shorts in particular, \"His Mouse Friday\", the depiction of cannibals, in \"Casanova Cat\", a scene where the face of Jerry is blackened by Tom with cigar smoke and \"Mouse Cleaning\" where Tom is shown as blackface has been removed from the Blu-ray DVD edition.\n\nIn Tom and Jerry's \"Spotlight Collection\" DVD, a disclaimer by Whoopi Goldberg warns viewers about the potentially offensive material in the cartoons and emphasizes that they were \"wrong then and they are wrong today\", borrowing a phrase from the Warner Bros. Golden collection. This disclaimer is also used in the \"Tom and Jerry Golden Collection: Volume 1\" on iTunes.\n\nAs of 2011, most shorts that feature Mammy Two Shoes, except \"Part Time Pal\", are rarely seen on Cartoon Network and Boomerang. There are other shorts (\"The Lonesome Mouse\" and \"Blue Cat Blues\") that are found inappropriate for the attended audiences rather than just having racist contents and are censored from the two channels as well.\n\nIn 2006, the British version of the Boomerang channel made plans to edit \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons being aired in the UK where the characters were seen to be smoking. There was a subsequent investigation by UK media watchdog Ofcom. It has also taken the U.S. approach by censoring blackface gags, though this seems to be random as not all scenes of this type are cut.\n\nIn 2013, it was reported that Cartoon Network of Brazil censored 27 shorts on the grounds of being \"politically incorrect\". In an official release, the channel confirmed that it had censored only two shorts (\"The Two Mouseketeers\" and \"Heavenly Puss\") \"by editorial issues and appropriateness of the content to the target audience—children of 7 to 11 years\".\n\n\"Tom and Jerry\" began appearing in comic books in 1942, as one of the features in \"Our Gang Comics\". In 1949, with MGM's live-action \"Our Gang\" shorts having ceased production five years earlier, the series was renamed \"Tom and Jerry Comics\". The pair continued to appear in various books for the rest of the 20th century.\n\nThe pair have also appeared in a number of video games as well, spanning titles for systems for the Sega Genesis plus also Sega Game Gear and the Sega Master System and their rival console around the 1990s, Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES and Nintendo 64 to more recent entries for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube and also on the portable Nintendo consoles, Game Boy and Nintendo DS.\n\nThroughout the years, the term and title \"Tom and Jerry\" became practically synonymous with never-ending rivalry, as much as the related \"cat and mouse fight\" metaphor has. Yet in \"Tom and Jerry\" it was not the more powerful Tom who usually came out on top.\n\nIn January 2009, IGN named Tom and Jerry as the 66th best in the Top 100 Animated TV Shows.\n\nIn 1945, Jerry made an appearance in the live-action MGM musical feature film \"Anchors Aweigh\", in which, through the use of special effects, he performs a dance routine with Gene Kelly. Tom is briefly seen in \"Anchors Aweigh\". He appears as a servant, offering King Jerry some food on a tray.\n\nBoth Tom and Jerry appear with Esther Williams in a dream sequence in another big-screen musical, \"Dangerous When Wet\" (1953).\n\nIn 1973, the magazine \"National Lampoon\" referenced \"Tom and Jerry\" in a violence-filled comic book parody, \"Kit 'n' Kaboodle\".\n\nIn \"The Simpsons\", \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\" is a spoof of \"Tom and Jerry\"—a \"cartoon within a cartoon\". In an episode of the series titled \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\", \"Worker and Parasite\", a replacement cartoon for \"Itchy & Scratchy\", is a reference to Soviet-era animation.\n\nIn an interview found on the DVD releases, several \"MADtv\" cast members stated that Tom and Jerry is one of their biggest influences for slapstick comedy. Also in the Cartoon Network show \"MAD\", Tom and Jerry appear in three segments \"Celebrity Birthdays\", \"Mickey Mouse Exterminator Service\", and \"Tom and Jury\". Johnny Knoxville from \"Jackass\" has stated that watching \"Tom and Jerry\" inspired many of the stunts in the movies.\n\nIn the pre-video era, \"Tom & Jerry\" cartoons were a popular subject for 8mm home movies, with the UK-based Walton Films issuing dozens of titles as colour one-reel Super 8 films, in both silent and sound editions. Walton's agreement with MGM obligated them to release the films in slightly edited form, even though the single-reel format would have comfortably accommodated the cartoons' seven to eight minute running time.\n\nMGM/UA released a series of \"Tom & Jerry\" laserdisc box sets in the 1990s. \"The Art of Tom & Jerry\" volumes 1 and 2, contain all the MGM shorts up to (but not including) the Deitch Era, including letterboxed versions of the shorts filmed in CinemaScope. The cartoons are all intact save for \"His Mouse Friday\" (dialogue has been wiped) and \"Saturday Evening Puss\", which is the re-drawn version with June Foray's voice added. A third volume to \"The Art of Tom & Jerry\" was released and contains all of the Chuck Jones-era \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts.\n\nThere have been several \"Tom and Jerry\" DVDs released in Region 1 (the United States and Canada), including a series of two-disc sets known as the \"Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection\". There have been negative responses to Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, due to some of the cartoons included on each having cuts and redubbed Mammy Two-Shoes dialogue. A replacement program offering uncut versions of the shorts on DVD was later announced. There are also negative responses to Vol. 3, due to \"Mouse Cleaning\" and \"Casanova Cat\" being excluded from these sets and \"His Mouse Friday\" being edited for content with an extreme zooming-in towards the end to avoid showing a particularly race-based caricature.\n\nThere have been two \"Tom and Jerry\" DVD sets in Region 2. In Western Europe, most of the \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts have been released (only two, \"The Million Dollar Cat\" and \"Busy Buddies\", were not included) under the name \"\". Almost all of the shorts contain re-dubbed Mammy Two-Shoes tracks. Despite these cuts, \"His Mouse Friday\", the only \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon to be completely taken off the airwaves in some countries due to claims of racism, is included, unedited with the exception of zooming-in as on the North American set. These are regular TV prints sent from the U.S. in the 1990s. Shorts produced in CinemaScope are presented in pan and scan. \"Mouse Cleaning\" and \"Casanova Cat\" are presented uncut as part of these sets.\n\n\"\" is available in six double-sided DVDs (issued in the United Kingdom) and 12 single-layer DVDs (issued throughout Western Europe). Another \"Tom and Jerry\" Region 2 DVD set is available in Japan. As with \"Tom and Jerry:Classic Collection\" in Western Europe, almost all of the shorts (including \"His Mouse Friday\") contain cuts. \"Slicked-up Pup\", \"Tom's Photo Finish\", \"Busy Buddies\", \"The Egg and Jerry\", \"Tops with Pops\" and \"Feedin' the Kiddie\" are excluded from these sets. However, most of these cartoons are included in the UK version. Most shorts produced in CinemaScope are presented in pan and scan for showing on the 4:3 aspect ratio television screen.\n\nPrior to 2015, the Gene Deitch-era shorts saw limited home media release outside of Europe and Asia. In Japan, all thirteen shorts were released on the \"Tom and Jerry & Droopy\" laserdisc and VHS, as well as on the bonus DVD for those who have purchased all the ten titles of the DVD collection series at its initial release. In the United Kingdom, the shorts are available on the second side of the \"Tom and Jerry Classic Collection: Volume 5\" DVD. In the United States, \"The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit\", \"Down and Outing\", and \"Carmen Get It!\" were included on the \"Paws for a Holiday\" VHS and DVD, the \"Summer Holidays\" DVD, and the \"Musical Mayhem\" DVD, respectively. On June 2, 2015, \"\" DVD was released in the United States, with all thirteen shorts as well as special features.\n\nThe Chuck Jones-era \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts were released in a two-disc set titled \"\" on June 23, 2009. On October 25, 2011, Warner Home Video released the first volume of the \"Tom and Jerry Golden Collection\" on DVD and Blu-ray. This set featured newly remastered prints and bonus material never before seen. The sets were aimed at the collector in a way that the previous \"Spotlight\" DVD releases were not. A second set was due for release at June 11, 2013. in February 2013, it was announced by TVShowsOnDVD.com that \"Mouse Cleaning\" was not part of the list of cartoons on this release, as well as the cartoon \"Casanova Cat\" that was also skipped over on the 2007 DVD release. Many collectors and fans have posted negative reviews of the product on Amazon and other various websites to make Warner put \"Mouse Cleaning\" and \"Casanova Cat\" on the release.\n\nThe following cartoons won the Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons:\n\nThese cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons, but did not win:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
