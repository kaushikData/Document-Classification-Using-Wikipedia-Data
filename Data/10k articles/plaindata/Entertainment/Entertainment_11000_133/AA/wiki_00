The basic premise involves an Irish Catholic girl and a young Jewish man who marry despite the objections of their families.\n\nAlthough initially receiving poor reviews, the Broadway play was a commercial hit, running for 2,327 performances between May 23, 1922, and October 1, 1927, at the time the longest run in Broadway theater history, surpassing the record 1,291 performances set by the Winchell Smith and Frank Bacon 1918 play, \"Lightnin'\". The show's touring company had a similarly long run and held the record for longest running touring company for nearly 40 years until the record was broken by \"Hello, Dolly!\" in the 1960s. The touring company's male lead was played by a young George Brent, the future Hollywood actor's first major role, and the female lead was played by Peggy Parry.\n\nThe play was twice the inspiration for films: in 1928 with Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers and Nancy Carroll, directed by Victor Fleming, and in 1946 with Richard Norris and Joanne Dru, directed by A. Edward Sutherland. The 1946 version, produced by Bing Crosby, met with considerable published controversy.\n\nIt inspired the weekly NBC radio series, Abie's Irish Rose, which replaced \"Knickerbocker Playhouse\" and ran from January 24, 1942, through September 2, 1944. Faced with listener protests about its stereotyped ethnic portrayals, the radio series was cancelled in 1945. Nichols wrote the scripts. Axel Gruenbert and Joe Rines directed the cast that starred Richard Bond, Sydney Smith, Richard Coogan and Clayton \"Bud\" Collyer as Abie Levy. Betty Winkler, Mercedes McCambridge, Julie Stevens, Bernard Gorcey, and Marion Shockley portrayed Rosemary Levy. Solomon Levy was played by Alfred White, Charlie Cantor and Alan Reed.\n\nOthers in the radio cast: Walter Kinsella (as Patrick Murphy), Menasha Skulnik (Isaac Cohen), Anna Appel (Mrs. Cohen), Ann Thomas (Casey), Bill Adams (Father Whelan), Amanda Randolph (maid) and Dolores Gillenas (the Levys' twins). The announcer was Howard Petrie, and Joe Stopak provided the music. The opening theme music was \"My Wild Irish Rose\" by Chauncey Olcott.\n\nThe basic premise was extensively copied, and Anne Nichols sued one imitator, Universal Pictures, which produced \"The Cohens and Kellys\", a motion picture play about an Irish boy who marries a Jewish girl from feuding families. However, in \"Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found for the defendant, holding that copyright protection cannot be extended to the characteristics of stock characters in a story, whether it be a book, play or film.\n\nThe plot was ably summarized by Judge Learned Hand, in his opinion in the lawsuit:\n\nThere have been some variations of the plot in different versions of the play/film. Nichols' original Broadway play had the couple meeting in France during World War I, with the young man having been a soldier and the girl a nurse who had tended to him. In this version, the priest and the rabbi from the wedding are also veterans of the same war, and recognize one another from their time in the service.\n\nAlthough the play was a tremendous popular success, it was universally loathed by the critics. Robert Benchley, then the theatre critic for \"Life\" magazine, nursed a particular hatred for it. Part of Benchley's job was to write capsule reviews each week. \"Abie's Irish Rose\" he described variously as \"Something Awful\", \"Just about as low as good clean fun can get\", \"Showing that the Jews and the Irish crack equally old jokes\", \"The comic spirit of 1876\", \"People laugh at this every night, which explains why democracy can never be a success\", \"Will the Marines never come?\" and finally \"Hebrews 13:8,\" a Biblical passage that reads, “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever.” He also held a contest for an outsider to contribute the capsule review, which Harpo Marx won with \"No worse than a bad cold.\" Lorenz Hart expressed the feeling of many in the theater world in these lines for \"Manhattan\": \"Our future babies we'll take to \"Abie's Irish Rose\" -- I hope they'll live to see it close.\" Writing in \"The New Yorker\" of its 1937 revival, Wolcott Gibbs said that \"it had, in fact, the rather eerie quality of a repeated nightmare; the one, perhaps, in which I always find myself in an old well, thick with bats, and can't get out.\"\n\nThe play was popular enough for its title to be referenced in a pun in the Marx Brothers film \"Animal Crackers\", in the lyrics of the Cole Porter song \"Ace in the Hole\", the Stephen Sondheim song \"I'm Still Here\", and the song \"The Legacy\" from the musical \"On the Twentieth Century\".\n\n\"Abie's Irish Rose\" prefigured the comedy of Stiller and Meara, a husband-and-wife team (Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara), who often spiked their routines with references to their differing backgrounds (Stiller is Jewish; Meara was of an Irish Catholic background but converted to Judaism later during their marriage).\n\nThe play also provided the central premise for the 1972–73 television series \"Bridget Loves Bernie\" (CBS), which starred Meredith Baxter and David Birney (who later became husband and wife in real life) in a kind-of reversal of \"Abie's Irish Rose\" in that Birney played struggling young Jewish cab driver/aspiring playwright Bernie Steinberg, whose parents ran a modest family delicatessen, and Baxter played Irish Catholic daughter of wealthy parents, Bridget Fitzgerald, who falls in love with and elopes with Steinberg to the disappointment of both sets of parents. (Although both actors were Protestant, the casting partially inverted real life, Birney being of Irish descent.) The show was attacked by a broad range of Jewish groups for allegedly promoting inter-faith marriage, and it was cancelled at the end of its first season, despite being the fifth-highest-rated serial of the 1972–1973 year on USA broadcast television.\n\nBut two decades later, with social attitudes changing in the USA, CBS would run another television series, \"Brooklyn Bridge\" (1991–1993), the quasi-autobiographical childhood memoir of its Jewish series creator, Gary David Goldberg, which featured a continuing romance between two main (teenage) characters, a Jewish boy and an Irish Catholic girl. It ran two seasons, with the sixth (two-part) episode of the first season, titled \"War of the Worlds\", exploring the tensions of this inter-faith relationship in its mid-1950s Brooklyn fictional setting. (Goldberg had previously created another quasi-autobiographical television series, \"Family Ties\", inspired by his adult life, in which the female lead, the alter-ego of his real-life Irish Catholic partner, had been portrayed by Meredith Baxter, the same actress who had starred in the ill-fated \"Bridget Loves Bernie\".)\n\n\n\n"}

This is somewhat akin to playing air guitar, explaining the name. The creator, \"J-Taro Sugisaku\", says that it was invented in Tokyo in 2006 by a group of bored men without girlfriends. \n\nA report about the phenomenon in the Japanese magazine \"Weekly Playboy\" in 2006 was picked up by the English language web site \"Mainichi Daily News\". A video of the air sex \"world championship\" was uploaded to YouTube in January 2007. This was followed by a segment of the BBC Three documentary show \"Japanorama\" in March 2007, subsequently uploaded to YouTube and flagged as \"inappropriate for some users\".\n\nThese videos led to coverage in the blogosphere. The \"Japanorama\" video was shown in May 2007 at the JACON 2007 convention in Orlando, Florida, and a spontaneous air sex competition ensued, footage of which also found its way to YouTube.\n\nIn late January and early February 2007, a group of American black male teenagers calling themselves \"Peer Pressure\" produced two videos showing air sex set to music, published on YouTube under the user name \"amp6\". Fleshbot called these \"The Best Air Sex Video of All Time\".\n\nSince August 2007, The Alamo Drafthouse has been holding bimonthly Air Sex competitions in the US. In June 2009 The Alamo Drafthouse toured the country on the Air Sex World Championships tour crowning Air Sex Champions in 14 cities. Later that October the first ever world champion was crowned when Shanghai Slammer from Los Angeles out-performed every other city champion. The tour was hosted by comedian Chris Trew. In October 2010 the group will tour once more. Photos are posted on the Alamo Drafthouse Flickr page.\n"}
{"id": "307335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307335", "title": "Banjo-Tooie", "text": "Banjo-Tooie\n\nBanjo-Tooie is a platform video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was first released on 20 November 2000 in North America and on 12 April 2001 in Europe, and later re-released as an Xbox Live Arcade game for the Xbox 360 on 29 April 2009. It is the second instalment in the \"Banjo-Kazooie\" series and serves as a sequel to the original \"Banjo-Kazooie\". The story of the game follows series protagonists Banjo and Kazooie as they attempt to stop the plans of antagonist Gruntilda and her two sisters from vapourising the inhabitants of the game's world.\n\nDevelopment of the game started in June 1998, directly after the release of its predecessor. Several new features were cut from the game due to time constraints and limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. \"Banjo-Tooie\" features levels that are significantly larger than those of its predecessor and requires the player to complete various challenges such as solving puzzles, collecting items, and defeating bosses. It also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in several minigames. Upon release, the game sold more than three million copies and received critical acclaim from video game critics. The game is also included in the \"Rare Replay\" video game compilation, released for the Xbox One in 2015.\n\nSimilar to its predecessor \"Banjo-Kazooie\", \"Banjo-Tooie\" features three-dimensional worlds containing items to be collected. Among the items are golden jigsaw pieces, called Jiggies, that are used to complete jigsaw puzzles that unlock the levels. Instead of exploring the hub world in search of incomplete puzzle boards as in \"Banjo-Kazooie\", a singular board is used within a temple where Master Jiggywiggy resides. Whenever the player has obtained the number of Jiggies required, a timed puzzle-completion challenge can be played, after which Jiggywiggy grants access to each world. Each puzzle challenge requires more Jiggies than the last.\n\nMusical notes return in \"Banjo-Tooie\", but are now used to learn new moves from Bottles' brother, the drill sergeant Jamjars, who assumes Bottles' role from the first game. All of Banjo and Kazooie's moves from the first game are immediately accessible in \"Banjo-Tooie\", and the player can acquire several new moves such as first-person aiming, new egg types, and the ability to play as Banjo and Kazooie separately, with each gaining moves they can only use while on their own. Mumbo Jumbo also returns, this time as a playable character who can venture out into each world and use specific magic spells to help Banjo and Kazooie proceed. Taking over Mumbo's previous role of transforming the duo into different forms is Humba Wumba, a Native American woman who acts as Mumbo's rival.\n\nAnother feature introduced in \"Banjo-Tooie\" is the direct connections between its worlds. In \"Banjo-Kazooie\" the titular duo would be transported to each level via special doors in Gruntilda's lair, but in \"Banjo-Tooie\" the levels are physically connected at multiple points and are effectively extensions of the Isle o' Hags hub world. In addition, the train Chuffy can be used to migrate minor characters between worlds which contain stations. The game also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can play each of the game's single-player minigames in customisable competitions.\n\nTwo years following Gruntilda's first defeat by Banjo and Kazooie, the two are playing poker with their friends Mumbo Jumbo and Bottles in Banjo's house. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters, Mingella and Blobbelda, arrive in a large digging machine, the \"Hag 1\", and destroy the boulder trapping Gruntilda with a magical spell. Unfortunately, Gruntilda's time spent underground has rotted her flesh away and reduced her to a skeleton. Seeking revenge, Gruntilda destroys Banjo's house before fleeing with her sisters. Banjo, Kazooie, and Mumbo escape the house, but Bottles, who stays behind believing it is all a joke, gets caught in the blast and is killed. The three remaining friends swear to track Gruntilda down and put an end to her plans.\n\nFollowing the witches' trail, Banjo and Kazooie arrive at Jinjo Village on the Isle o' Hags, where King Jingaling, king of all the Jinjos, explains that his subjects were frightened away by the \"Hag 1\" and scattered throughout the island. He gives the two their first Jiggy as a token of gratitude to help find them. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters introduce her to a cannon called the \"Big-O-Blaster\" (B.O.B.) that can suck the life force from any given target. They test B.O.B. on King Jingaling, who consequently is turned into a zombie. Gruntilda plans to charge B.O.B. long enough to blast the entire island and use the stolen life force to restore her body. The witch's most loyal minion, Klungo, is sent out to hinder Banjo and Kazooie in their progress by fighting them, but after taking many beatings from Gruntilda as punishment for losing to them, Klungo eventually abandons her and sides with Banjo and Kazooie.\n\nFinally reaching Gruntilda's fortress at Cauldron Keep, Banjo and Kazooie confront the witch and her sisters in a trivia quiz show named the \"Tower of Tragedy Quiz\" in which losing competitors will be flattened under one-ton weights. Mingella and Blobbelda lose to Banjo and Kazooie, getting crushed, but Gruntilda escapes. Banjo and Kazooie then reverse the effects of B.O.B., resurrecting both King Jingaling and Bottles, who celebrate at Bottles' house along with Klungo. Banjo and Kazooie enter the top of the fortress and defeat Gruntilda, destroying most of her body and the \"Hag 1\" along with her. The two return to Bottles' house with their remaining friends (Jamjars, Mumbo, and Wumba) to find that everyone else has celebrated without them, much to their disappointment. They instead head to the top of Cauldron Keep and play a game of hacky-sack with Gruntilda's head, who vows to have her revenge.\n\n\"Banjo-Tooie\" was developed by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on \"Banjo-Kazooie\". Development of the game started in June 1998. Some features that were originally cut during the development of \"Banjo-Kazooie\", such as some of its worlds and a multiplayer game mode, were instead integrated into \"Banjo-Tooie\". An additional world set in a castle was planned, but due to time constraints, it was scrapped during development and assets from it were used in constructing Cauldron Keep. The game features roughly 150 total characters, including enemies and non-playable characters.\n\nOriginally, Rare planned to include an additional mode, called \"Bottles' Revenge\", where a second player could play as an undead version of Bottles and take control of enemy characters to hinder Banjo in his quest, with the players swapping roles if the enemy character managed to defeat Banjo. The idea was ultimately scrapped because the developers ran out of time to debug it, despite admitting that \"it did work rather well\". However, it would later serve as the inspiration behind the \"Counter-Operative\" multiplayer mode in \"Perfect Dark\". Bosses were originally to be able to be controllable by the second player as well, but the only boss that the developers had working when they dropped the mode was the second world boss, 'Old King Coal'. The developers also planned to implement a feature, called \"Stop 'N' Swop\", that would have allowed data to be transferred from \"Banjo-Kazooie\" to \"Banjo-Tooie\" so that players could unlock additional bonuses in \"Banjo-Tooie\". However, due to hardware limitations of the Nintendo 64 system, the feature was ultimately dropped. Despite this, Rare decided to include at least some of the additional bonuses within the game. The Stop 'N' Swop feature was later implemented in the Xbox Live re-release.\n\nThe music was composed by Grant Kirkhope, who previously worked as the main composer for \"Perfect Dark\", \"Donkey Kong 64\", and \"Banjo-Kazooie\". As \"Banjo-Tooie\" was a larger game than its predecessor, Kirkhope had twice the memory space in the game's cartridge for sound effects and music. Kirkhope initially had to pause his work on \"Banjo-Tooie\" to work on other projects first, but ultimately the music score for the game was completed on time. Like the original, the themes heard in the game were designed to be interactive, which dynamically change to reflect the player's location. Due to the game having larger memory space Kirkhope was able to combine two MIDI files to channel different fades of music when the player moves to different locations. The developers initially aimed for a fourth quarter 1999 release, but the game was ultimately delayed. \"Banjo-Tooie\" was presented at the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo and released on 20 November 2000. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak.\n\nUpon release, \"Banjo-Tooie\" was critically acclaimed and sold more than three million copies worldwide. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution considered \"Banjo-Tooie\" to be less repetitive than \"Donkey Kong 64\" and a worthy successor to \"Banjo-Kazooie\". \"Nintendo Power\" referred to \"Banjo-Tooie\" as \"the perfect cross between \"Donkey Kong 64\" and \"Banjo-Kazooie\"\", noting that it features less backtracking between levels than \"Donkey Kong 64\" does. The publication also stated that the only disappointment was how Rare resolved the \"Stop 'N' Swop\" bonuses. Mark Green of \"N64 Magazine\" felt that, although \"Banjo-Tooie\" delivers \"a decent complement of clever puzzles and enjoyable run-and-jump moments\", it did not feel \"as fresh or as exciting\" as previous Rare platformers.\n\nThe graphics were considered some of the best on the Nintendo 64 due to their rich textures, long drawing distance, and real-time shadow generation, but were criticised for their inconsistent frame rate during certain points in the game. Nevertheless, GameSpot noted that the action level of the game was normally low enough that it \"does not significantly distract from the experience\". Game Revolution said that the game was \"beautiful\", but it did not meet the same level of awe as its predecessor. The game was also praised for its humour, with \"Edge\" commenting that its characters are \"impossible to dislike.\"\n\nThe gameplay was highlighted for the size of the game's worlds. Jes Bickham of GamesRadar described \"Banjo-Tooie\" as a game that requires a massive time-investment on the player's part, saying that \"Keeping track of what you can do next, or where you can re-visit to get something new, requires either a photographic memory or copious note-taking\". Similarly, \"GamePro\" remarked that the game is so large that players might lose their way and forget what they are supposed to do. GameSpot's Shane Satterfield praised the game's level design and progression for constantly requiring players to collect Jiggies. Despite the praise, \"Edge\" concluded that Rare should have innovated more instead of simply copying the formula of \"Super Mario 64\". At the 2000 GameSpot Game of the Year awards, \"Banjo-Tooie\" was awarded Best Platform Game.\n\nAn Xbox Live Arcade version of \"Banjo-Tooie\", developed by 4J Studios, was released for the Xbox 360 on 29 April 2009. This version features a smoother frame rate and high-definition graphics, and supports the \"Stop 'N' Swop\" connectivity with the Xbox Live Arcade version of its predecessor, allowing players to unlock the bonuses included in the original Nintendo 64 version as well as new content related to the Xbox 360. Using the Stop 'N' Swop items in the Xbox Live Arcade version of \"Banjo-Tooie\" also unlocks additional bonuses in the \"L.O.G.'s Lost Challenges\" downloadable content for \"\". The Xbox Live Arcade version of \"Banjo-Tooie\" received mixed to favourable reviews from video game critics, featuring an aggregate score of 73 out of 100 at Metacritic. In 2015, the Xbox Live Arcade version of the game was included as part of the \"Rare Replay\" video game compilation for Xbox One.\n\n"}

He earned an international reputation for his eclectic approach to dance education (particularly seen in his directorship of the Juilliard School Dance Division), as well as through his leadership of a number of prominent dance companies.\n\nHarkarvy began to study dance at the age of thirteen, already focused on the goal of teaching. Among his principal teachers were two highly regarded Russian expatriates: Edward Caton and Elizabeth Anderson-Ivantzova. Harkarvy studied primarily at the School of American Ballet. He had only a brief performing career, making his debut with the Brooklyn Lyric Opera at the age of eighteen and appearing in summer stock productions. From 1951 to 1955, he taught at Michel Fokine's school in New York City, and, in 1955, he opened his own school. Harkarvy's first post with a dance company came in 1957 with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. The following year he was named ballet master of the Dutch National Ballet. Unhappy over problems with that company, he and a number of the dancers broke away and formed Nederlands Dans Theater in 1959. Harkarvy and Hans van Manen co-directed this new company, which combined ballet and modern dance in its repertory, for a decade. In 1969, Harkarvy became co-director, with Lawrence Rhodes, of the Harkness Ballet, which was disbanded the following year. He then returned to the Dutch National Ballet for a year, but, from 1972 to 1982, he was affiliated with the Pennsylvania Ballet. For Pennsylvania Ballet he taught daily and re-staged several of his well-known ballets-Madrigalesco, Recital for Cello and 8 Dancers, Grand Pas Espagnol plus created several new works including Quartet, Time Passed Summer, Continuum, Four Men Waiting, From Gentle Circles, Signatures and Poems of Love and the Seasons. He also brought in choreographers including Hans van Manen, Charles Czarny, Margo Sappington, Lynne Taylor-Corbett, Rodney Griffin, Choo San Goh, to create works for the company. During this period, Harkarvy helped to raise the profile of the Philadelphia-based troupe, but he left in 1982 after the company began to experience severe financial difficulties. He subsequently held a variety of teaching positions before joining the Juilliard faculty in 1990. As director of the Juilliard's Dance Division from 1992, Harkarvy expanded existing programs and created innovative new ones, remaining with the school until the time of his death.\n\n"}

The act established a national policy for the regulation of cable television communications by federal, state, and local authorities. Conservative Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona wrote and supported the act, which amended the Communications Act of 1934 with the insertion of \"Title VI—Cable Communications\". After more than three years of debate, six provisions were enacted to represent the intricate compromise between cable operators and municipalities.\n\nThe scholarly article, \"Perceived Impact of the Cable Policy Act of 1984,\" published in the \"Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media\" in 1987, described its objective as follows:\n\nThe new law attempted to strike a delicate balance between the FCC, local governments, and marketplace competition, where in the past, each of these entities had vied for dominance. The Cable Act was to be the solution to the ongoing problem of who, or what, should exercise the most power over local cable operations.\n\nIn order to balance power between cable television operators and the government, the act established regulations regarding franchise standards and proceeds that would attempt to strengthen the development of cable systems. The act gave municipalities, governing bodies of cities and towns, principal authority to grant and renew franchise licenses for cable operations. By establishing an orderly process for franchise renewal, the act protected cable operators from unfair denials of renewal. However, in order to be granted a franchise renewal, the act specified that cable operators' past performances and future proposals had to meet the federal standards in the new title. The act was meant to reduce an unnecessary regulation that could have potentially brought about an excessive economic burden on cable systems.\n\nIn return for establishing franchise standards and procedures, the act specified that cable operators were expected to be receptive to their local communities' needs and interests. \nCongress recognized the vital role of cable television in encouraging and providing a place for free expression. This provision assured that cable communications provide the general public with \"the widest possible diversity of information sources and services.\" Through this statute, Congress attempted to uphold the First Amendment interest of cable audiences to receive diversified information as specified in the \"Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission\" court case of 1969.\n\nThis provision declared that state and local authorities should allow, but not mandate, that this type of information be distributed via non-commercial Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels. Furthermore, it prohibited cable operators from exerting any type of editorial control over program content broadcast through PEG channels and freed them from any potential liability for the content. The act lifted programming rules and subscription fees. It was this provision that inspired Senator Barry Goldwater to begin his work on the Cable Communications Act of 1984.\n\nThe Cable Communication Act of 1984 added \"Title VI—Cable Communications\" to the Communications Act of 1934. The title was originally divided into the following sections:\n\n\nIn 1972, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) issued the \"Third Report and Order.\" The order was enacted to encourage consumer choice and innovation among video devices. The regulations adopted in the order established requirements for broadband, cellular, and wireline Personal Communications Services (PCS) carriers in compliance with the assistance capability requirements prescribed by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. The FCC hoped that the newly adopted regulations would generate a competitive marketplace for various devices capable of accessing cable video services by allowing consumers to purchase smart video devices that were compatible with all multichannel video programming services. This would allow consumers the freedom to change service providers without changing their entertainment devices. The \"Third Report and Order\" resulted in the top 100 U.S. television markets providing three Public-access television channels, each for Public-access television, Educational-access, or Government-access television (GATV) (PEG) use. If demand was low for all three channels in a specific market, cable companies had the jurisdiction to supply fewer channels. At least one PEG channel was required at all times.\n\nIn 1976, the regulation was expanded to include cable television systems in communities with 3,500 or more subscribers. Cable companies saw the regulation by the federal government as an unlawful intrusion into their business practices and immediately started to challenge its legality. In the court case \"United States v. Midwest Video Corp.,\" the Midwest Video Corporation sued the FCC for overstepping its authority in requiring Public-access television channels. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC's requirements for local origination facilities. However, in 1979, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Midwest Video Corp. stating that the FCC's new requirements exceeded the agency's statutory powers as granted to them by Congress and as required by cable operators to provide Public-access television. The FCC was interfering with the agency's First Amendment rights. After the Supreme Court's decision, PEG advocates started work on what became the Cable Communications Act of 1984.\n\nThe need for an act to determine who holds regulatory authority for cable communications was quite evident, however it took time to reach an agreement. Negotiations for the act lasted nearly two years and agreements moved back and forth between the House and the Senate. The two parties involved in the negotiations were the National League of Cities (NLC) and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA), formerly the National Cable Television Association. These parties worked to lobby Congress for their respective members, who represented diverse populations and had firm, unyielding interests. Instead of having Congress determine the outcome of a stalemate, the two organizations tried to present a unified front. This was a strategic move meant to increase the likelihood that the bill would be passed in both the House and the Senate.\n\nThe act began as bill S. 66 in the Senate where it was passed on June 14, 1983 and moved on to the House. The companion bill, H.R. 4103, in the House was passed on October 1, 1984 and returned to the Senate where modifications were made to conjoin the texts. The bill was officially passed on October 11, 1984 and signed by President Ronald Reagan on October 30, 1984. During negotiations, the agreements were voided four times. The National League of Cities (NLC) voided agreements three times because cable companies were freed from rate regulation, given renewal expectancy, and could default on promises in certain circumstances. On the other hand, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NTCA) voided agreements once because they felt that another Supreme Court ruling would provide the industry with better rate deregulation than under the present FCC regulations or the bill.\n\nThe result of the act was an intricate, minimally influential agreement between cable operators and municipalities. It has been highly debated for its effectiveness, because evidence shows that unaffiliated television programming on leased access channels was avoided and rarely appeared. As a title of the larger Communications Act of 1934, the Cable Communications Act of 1984 has been amended and revised with the Cable Act of 1992, also referred to as Cable Television Protection and Competition Act, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n\nThe Cable Communications Act of 1984 had minimal advantages, because it was enacted around a strong legislative agreement between the demands of cable operators and the demands of the public. During the negotiation process, there was relatively little public participation, meaning cable consumers and public, educational, and government access (PEG) advocates were left vulnerable to cable operators' enforcement and decisions.\n\nThere was dramatic growth in the cable industry once the act went into effect. However, it remained largely in the hands of few local monopolies that were able to determine the content of the programs and set the rates for services and channels on their system. These changes in authority were not immediate, but evolved over the course of a few years. Cable consumers were outraged with the increases in prices and services, whereas municipalities were annoyed with violated contracts. Many of these outcomes can be attributed to the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) interpretation of Congress' mandates, which contained poor choice of language and confusion over the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nCable consumers' complaints about the outcomes led to policy discussions in the late eighties and early nineties in which public interest was considered but not represented. If monopolies were broken apart and competition was restored, then many of the problems would likely be resolved. Cable operators would not refuse to carry programs and services with popular demand, and prices would return to appropriate and economical rates.\nIn order to address this problem, the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992 was passed to regulate cable television rates that cable operators charged consumers.\n\nThe law, intending to grant privileges to local community members by allowing them to require PEG channels also allowed these municipalities to decide against PEG requirements. In franchise agreements, contracted between cable operators and municipalities, the municipality could specify a PEG channel requirement and later opt out of these channels, keeping the cable television franchise fees for their general fund and supplying their communities with no PEG outlets or channel capacity. Since its approval, many public-access television centers have closed as a result of the opt-out provision.\n\nSince the act prevented cable operators from regulating publicly generated content, much controversy developed around what was allowed to appear on these channels. A public-access television center in Eau Claire, Wisconsin was faulted for televising a video created by Christian Bangert, a man convicted of murdering a city police officer. The tape was shown repeatedly during Bangert's trial, and many people felt its airing was in bad taste. Across the country, controversial content such as explicit sex and promotion of Nazi groups have aired via PEG channels. Congress, in an attempt to protect viewers from indecent programming, passed the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992, which allowed the FCC to establish rules requiring cable operators to prohibit particular shows. In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the law was unconstitutional claiming that cable operators should never be required to act on behalf of the federal government to control expression in relation to content.\nCommercial leased access did not provide cable subscribers with a diversity of information as it was required, because it was avoided and never mandated by local franchising authority. In the 1998 court case \"Time Warner Entertainment Co. vs. FCC,\" the court deemed the act ineffective in terms of unaffiliated programming. \"The 1984 legislation did not accomplish much. Unaffiliated programming on leased channels rarely appeared.\" The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act reinforced its intent that leased access to provide a diversity of information to subscribers as determined by the cable operators. The \"Time Warner Entertainment Co. vs. FCC\" court also upheld the provision mentioned above.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "225543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225543", "title": "Carol Channing", "text": "Carol Channing\n\nCarol Elaine Channing (born January 31, 1921) is an American actress, singer, dancer and comedian. Notable for starring in Broadway and film musicals, her characters typically radiate a fervent expressiveness and an easily identifiable voice, whether singing or for comedic effect. Carol Channing also studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City.\n\nShe began as a Broadway musical actress, starring in \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" in 1949, and \"Hello, Dolly!\" in 1964, when she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. She revived both roles several times throughout her career, most recently playing Dolly in 1995. Channing was nominated for her first Tony Award in 1956 for \"The Vamp\" followed by a nomination in 1961 for \"Show Girl\". She received her fourth Tony Award nomination for the musical \"Lorelei\" in 1974.\n\nAs a film actress, she won the Golden Globe Award and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Muzzy in \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\" (1967). Other film appearances include \"The First Traveling Saleslady\" (1956) and \"Skidoo\" (1968). On television, she appeared as an entertainer on variety shows, from \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in the 1950s to \"Hollywood Squares\". She had a standout performance as The White Queen in the TV production of \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1985), and had the first of many TV specials in 1966, \"An Evening with Carol Channing\".\n\nChanning was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981 and received a Lifetime Achievement Tony Award in 1995. She continues to perform and make appearances, singing songs from her repertoire and sharing stories with fans, cabaret style. She released an autobiography, titled \"Just Lucky I Guess\", in 2002, and \"Larger Than Life\", a documentary film about her career, was released in 2012.\n\nChanning was born in Seattle, Washington, on January 31, 1921, the only child of Adelaide (née Glaser; 1886–1984) and George Christian Channing (1888-1957). Her mother was of German Jewish descent and Channing considers herself \"part-Jewish\". Her father, who was multiracial (African American and German), changed his surname from Stucker to Channing before Carol's birth. A city editor at the \"Seattle Star\", he took a job in San Francisco and the family moved when Channing was two weeks old. He became a Christian Science practitioner, editor and teacher.\n\nChanning attended Aptos Junior High School and Lowell High School San Francisco, graduating in 1938. She won the Crusaders' Oratorical Contest and a free trip to Hawaii with her mother in June 1937.\n\nWhen she was 16, she left home to attend Bennington College in Vermont and her mother told her for the first time that her father's mother was African American and his father was German American.\n\nHer mother felt that the time was right to tell her since now that she was going off to college and would be on her own, she didn't want her to be surprised if she ever had a black baby. Channing writes:\n\nShe majored in drama at Bennington and during an interview in 1994 admitted that she first wanted to perform on stage as a singer when she was in the fourth grade. She recalls being emotionally drawn to the stage after seeing Ethel Waters perform.\n\nShe has stated that in the fourth grade she ran for and was elected class secretary: \"I stood up in class and campaigned by kidding the teachers. The other kids laughed. I loved the feelingIt was a very good feeling; it still is.\" She read the class minutes every Friday, often impersonating the children who were discussed. She also considers the fact that she was able to see plays while very young to have been an important inspiration:\n\nHer election to class secretary continued through grammar and high school: \"It was very good training—like stock\" Those weekly sessions in front of students became a habit which she carried to Bennington College, where she would entertain every Friday night. During her junior year she began trying out for acting parts on Broadway. After playing a small part in revue, the \"New Yorker\" magazine noted her performance: \"You'll be hearing more from a comedienne named Carol Channing.\"\n\nThe inspiration she received from that brief notice made her decide to quit school. However, it was four years before she found another acting job. During that period she performed at small functions or benefits, including some in the Catskill resorts. She also worked in Macy's bakery.\n\nChanning was introduced to the stage while helping her mother deliver newspapers to the backstage of theatres.\n\nHer first job on stage in New York was in Marc Blitzstein's \"No for an Answer,\" starting January 5, 1941, at the Mecca Temple (later New York's City Center). She was 19 years old. Channing moved to Broadway for \"Let's Face It!\", in which she was an understudy for Eve Arden, who was 13 years older than Channing. Decades later, Arden would play Dolly in a road company after Channing finally relinquished her signature role.\nFive years later, Channing had a featured role in \"Lend an Ear\" (1948), for which she received her Theatre World Award and launched her as a star performer. Channing credited illustrator Al Hirschfeld for helping make her a star when he put her image in his widely published illustrations. She said that his drawing of her as a flapper was what helped her get the lead in her next play, the Jule Styne and Anita Loos musical, \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\". From that role, as Lorelei Lee, she gained recognition, with her signature song from the production, \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,\" among the most widely known. In January 1950, \"Time\" magazine ran a cover story about her becoming a new star on Broadway, followed by cover stories in \"Life\" magazine in 1955 and 1964.\n\nIn 1956, Channing married her manager and publicist Charles Lowe. During the 1950s, he produced the Burns and Allen comedy show, which starred George Burns and Gracie Allen. When Allen was forced to discontinue performing due to medical problems, she saw that Burns was in need of a partner to play off of on stage since he was best as a straight man. She remembered that Channing, like her, had one of the most distinctive and recognizable voices in show business, and Lowe asked Channing if she would perform with Burns during his shows. She accepted immediately, and Channing worked on and off with Burns through the late 1950s. Burns also appeared in her TV special, \"An Evening with Carol Channing\", in 1966.\n\nIn 1961, Channing became one of the few performers nominated for a Tony Award for work in a revue (rather than a traditional book musical); she was nominated for Best Actress in a Musical for the short-lived revue \"Show Girl\".\n\nChanning came to national prominence as the star of Jerry Herman's \"Hello, Dolly!\" (1964). Her performance as Dolly Levi won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. She recalls that playwright Thornton Wilder so loved the musical, which was based on his play, \"The Matchmaker\", that he came once a week. He also planned to rewrite his 1942 play \"The Skin of Our Teeth\", with Channing playing the parts of both Mrs. Antrobus and Sabina, but died before he could finish it.\n\nHer role became widely popular in the 1960s, and she was often invited to major events, including those at the White House, where she might sing. In 1964, for instance, she was invited to the Democratic convention where she sang a take-off song, \"Hello, Lyndon\", for Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ)'s campaign. She was a favorite of Lady Bird Johnson, who once gave her a massive bouquet after a show.\n\nThe old-fashioned plot of \"Hello, Dolly\", when first described, might seem uninspired, says columnist Dick Kleiner:\n\nThe show had first opened on Broadway on January 16, 1964, and by the time the show closed in late December 1970, it had become the longest-running musical in Broadway history, with nearly 3,000 performances. Besides Channing, six other stars played the title role during those seven years: Ginger Rogers, Martha Raye, Betty Grable, Pearl Bailey, Phyllis Diller and Ethel Merman.\nAl Hirschfeld's illustration of her was printed on the front page of the \"Sunday Theatre\" section of the \"New York Times\", which she feels captured the essence of her character: \"How did the great Hirschfeld know precisely what I was thinking? ... To be Hirschfelded is an eerie experience. You better not have anything to hide, because he'll expose it like a neon sign\", she wrote. The illustration was also printed on the cover of magazines, including \"Horizon\". She later appeared in the movie biography about his life, , in 2004.\n\nChanning reprised her role of Lorelei Lee when the musical \"Lorelei\", directed by Robert Moore and choreographed by Ernest O. Flatt, premiered in 1973 at the Oklahoma City (6000 seat) Civic Center Music Hall and broke all box office records after six days' worth of performances sold out within 24 hours.\n\nTo commemorate this record event, the street running in front of the Music Hall was renamed Channing Square Drive in her honor. Also in the cast were Peter Palmer, Brandon Maggart, Dody Goodman, and Lee Roy Reams. For nearly a year, the stage musical then toured 11 cities across the country. \"Lorelei\" had already earned a hefty profit by the time it opened on Broadway at the Palace Theatre on January 27, 1974, and ran for a total of 320 performances. Channing also appeared in two New York City revivals of \"Hello, Dolly!\", and toured with it extensively throughout the United States.\n\nShe performed songs from \"Hello, Dolly\" during a special television show in London in 1979.\n\nShe also appeared in a number of films, including \"The First Traveling Sales Lady\" (1956; with Ginger Rogers and Clint Eastwood), the cult film \"Skidoo\", and \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\" (starring Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore, John Gavin, and Beatrice Lillie). For \"Millie\" she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and was awarded a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture. Channing said she was especially grateful to Andrews for helping her develop her character: \"She will forever be my angel,\" she says.\n\nDue to her success on Broadway in \"Hello Dolly!\" and her co-starring role in \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\", Channing attracted the attentions of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, who were interested in starring her in a sitcom. Directed and produced by Arnaz and written by Bob Carroll, Jr. and Madelyn Davis (who co-wrote \"I Love Lucy\" and \"The Lucy Show\"), \"The Carol Channing Show\" starred Channing as Carol Hunnicut, a small-town girl trying and failing to make it in New York City show business. Character actors Richard Deacon and Jane Dulo were in the supporting cast. The pilot was filmed in front of a live audience (with a laugh track added) at Desilu in 1966, but did not sell as a series.\n\nIn 1966, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre. During her film career, Channing also made some guest appearances on television sitcoms and talk shows, including \"What's My Line?\" where she appeared in 11 episodes from 1962 to 1966. Channing did voice-over work in cartoons, most notably as Grandmama in an animated version of \"The Addams Family\" from 1992-95.\n\nDuring most of her career, she was asked to perform in various skits or appear as a guest on regular shows. In the 1960s, she was on \"The Andy Williams Show\". In 1985, she played the role of the White Queen in the television special \"Alice in Wonderland\". In 1986, Channing appeared on \"Sesame Street\" and sang a parody of the song \"Hello, Dolly!\" called \"Hello, Sammy!\", a love song being sung by Carol to a character known as Sammy the Snake (as voiced by Muppets creator Jim Henson). Carol, in this parody segment, serenades Sammy telling him just how much she loves and adores him while Sammy coils himself around Carol's arms. Carol's song includes lyrics such as: \"So..turn on your charm, Sammy/Coil yourself around my arm, Sammy/Sammy the Snake, I'll stake a claim on you\". Songwriter Jule Styne, who wrote the score for \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\", invited her on his television special in 1987 where she performed another one of her signature songs, \"Little Girl from Little Rock\".\n\nIn 1993, she poked a little fun at herself in an episode of \"The Nanny\". The episode \"Smoke Gets in Your Lies\" shows the producer auditioning for a new musical and Channing, playing herself, is trying out. Just after the producer announces he wants a stage presence that is instantly recognizable to the entire country, Channing begins with her signature \"Hello, Dolly!\", but he stops her with a resounding \"Next!\".\n\nIn January 2003, Channing recorded the audiobook of her best-selling autobiography \"Just Lucky, I Guess: A Memoir of Sorts\", directed and produced by Steve Garrin at VideoActive Productions in New York City. It was during the recording sessions that she received a phone call from her childhood sweetheart Harry Kullijian that rekindled their romance and led to their marriage a few months later. In January 2011, the documentary \"Carol Channing: Larger Than Life\" (which chronicles Channing's life and career) was released.\n\nChanning has been married four times. Her first husband was Theodore Naidish, whom she married when she was 20 in 1941. He was a writer, who in 1944 wrote \"Watch Out for Willie Carter\", but during the nearly five years of their marriage, earned little income: \"There was no money for food, clothing or housing.\"\n\nThey lived near his grandparents in Brighton Beach. She remembers his grandfather, Sam Cohen, describing his life back in Russia before he immigrated. Cohen also introduced her to some of his neighborhood friends, who were amazed that she enjoyed hearing their funny stories. \"They were delighted that I almost ate them up alive,\" she says, \"because they were so funny, especially since such appreciation was coming from what we all thought then was a shiksa (me).\" She learned to speak fluent Yiddish from \"Grandpa Cohen\", a skill which helped her understand the boardwalk conversations that went on around her in town.\n\nHer second husband Alexander Carson played center for the Ottawa Rough Riders Canadian football team. They had one son named Channing Carson.\n\nIn 1956, Channing married her manager and publicist Charles Lowe. They remained married for 42 years. During this time, her son Channing Carson took his stepfather's surname; he publishes his cartoons as Chan Lowe and has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his work. Channing filed for divorce from Lowe in 1998, but her estranged husband died before the divorce was finalized.\n\nAfter Lowe's death and until shortly before her fourth marriage, the actress's companion was Roger Denny, an interior decorator.\n\nIn 2003, while recording the audiobook of her autobiography \"Just Lucky, I Guess\", at VideoActive Productions, NYC, Produced and Directed by Steve Garrin, she rekindled her romance with her junior high school sweetheart, Harry Kullijian, and they married on May 10, 2003. They later performed at their old junior high school in a benefit for the school. They also promoted arts education in California schools through their Dr. Carol Channing and Harry Kullijian Foundation. The couple resided in Rancho Mirage, California. Harry Kullijian died on December 26, 2011, the eve of his 92nd birthday. The recording of Carol's autobiography has never been publicly released.\n\nChanning has unique dietary habits. In 1978, she said she hadn't eaten restaurant food in 15 years, and preferred only organic food. When invited to restaurants, she would bring several sealed containers with her own food, such as zucchini or chopped celery, and simply ask for an empty plate and glass. For dessert, she would eat seeds. Nor would she drink alcoholic beverages of any sort.\n\nChanning is an ovarian cancer survivor.\n\nChanning is a registered Democrat and showed her support for Lyndon Johnson's campaign for president by singing \"Hello, Lyndon\", a version of \"Hello, Dolly\", at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is written by Kindrick, Courtney Branning, Matt Heder and is produced by Mummy Space Island Productions. The series follows the life of a hapless young college student Andy (Matt Heder), whose grandma (Beverly Welsh) comes back from the dead to help him find love. The series is hosted by Jon Heder who begins each episode with a campy intro reminiscent of the openings of nostalgic shows such as Masterpiece Theater and The Wonderful World of Disney.\n\nEach episode follows a two-act structure split up by the opening title sequence and theme song. The series is often abruptly interrupted by parody commercial breaks. A PSA starring a Dead Grandma cast member is also featured after the end credits of every episode.\n\nDead Grandma combines live action with an animated sky and cloud background. The production took place over the course of two weekends in March & April 2010. Filming locations included Art Center College of Design, Pasadena City College, Cafe 50's, Big Mama's Rib Shack and various locations in Pasadena and Studio City. The series was mentored by television and film director Jeremiah Chechick.\n\nThe writers often referred to the protagonist Andy as a self-deprecating Charlie Brown-type character from \"Peanuts\" since he is consistently bullied and fails and nearly everything he attempts. The tone of the series was heavily influenced by 1990s sitcoms such as \"Family Matters\", \"Full House\", \"Saved by the Bell\", \"The Wonder Years\", and \"The Simpsons\".\n\nDead Grandma takes place in the fictional city of Notpasadena where Andy and his classmates attend the shady Notpasadena Community College.\n\nMain Characters\n\n\nReoccurring Characters\n\nReviews\n\nThe Knife Fight praised the show as being \"one of the more polished creations on the web today, boasting high production value as well as a hilariously original concept.\" The trailer currently has a 92% rating on Funny or Die.\n\nAwards & nominations\n\nThe score was written and performed by Garrick Hargrove and heavily features ukulele, chimes and shakers. The theme song melody is often revisited and reprised throughout the score. Several other original songs were written for specific episodes including \"Delicious Creamy Sweets\" written & performed by Ben Lazarus and \"Super Exciting Pirate Adventure Explosion the Move 2\" written & performed by Amos Watene, Aaron Watene, Matt Heder, Will Kindrick and Ryan Augustine.\n\nThe theme song pays homage to classic campy 1950's-60's television series. The song was written by Will Kindrick and performed, arranged and recorded by the Brea California based a cappella group, \"Soundstage\".\n\nA benefit fundraiser concert was held July 30, 2010 on the roof top of the Fox Theater in Pomona CA to raise proceeds for the series. The show featured musical acts GOGO13, Digital Unicorn and Eyes Lips Eyes.\n\n"}

He was born in Littlefield, Texas but his family moved to Lubbock soon after. He attended Texas Tech University where he drew cartoons for \"The University Daily\" student newspaper. He appeared as \"Uncle Dirk\" on a local children's program for three years while heading up his advertising agency, West Advertising. Beginning in the 1960s, he cartooned for the \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\".\n\nWest's most famous works featured caricatures of the sports mascots of various universities, mostly those of the Southwest Conference (and later the Big 12 Conference), but other schools appeared as well, usually because they were playing Texas Tech. His cartoons appeared in program books, on posters, and in magazines.\n\nTwo of his characters would eventually be officially adopted by their respective universities: Texas Tech's Raider Red and the University of Nebraska's Herbie Husker.\n\nWest drew a semi-weekly one-panel comic in the \"Avalanche-Journal\"'s sports section where he would lampoon college mascots and coaches alike, as well as the stereotypes of various universities. Thus there was the dim-witted Texas A&M Aggie, the devout but overemotional Baylor Bear, the arrogant University of Texas at Austin Longhorn and of course Raider Red, whose bullet-riddled Stetson showed by the number of holes the number of game losses for Texas Tech so far that season.\n\nWest would alter the image of his characters over the course of a sports season. A winning team's mascot would gradually get larger and tougher, the fans of losing teams would find their mascots growing thinner as the weeks went by.\n\nAfter serving several years on the local Parks and Recreation Board and the city council, West was elected mayor of Lubbock in 1978, but disliked politics so much as a result that he did not run for a second term (his single term ran from 1978-1980). He returned to his advertising agency and his cartooning, both of which he kept up until his death from a heart attack in 1996.\n\nAn exhibition dedicated to West and his work opened September 25, 2005, at the Museum of Texas Tech University. It ran through January 2006.\n\n"}

She made her professional stage debut in 1944 and appeared in numerous stage plays, musicals, feature films and television series. She was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nStritch made her Broadway debut in the 1946 comedy \"Loco\" and went on to receive four Tony Award nominations: for the William Inge play \"Bus Stop\" (1956); the Noël Coward musical \"Sail Away\" (1962); the Stephen Sondheim musical \"Company\" (1971), which included her performance of the song \"The Ladies Who Lunch\"; and for the revival of the Edward Albee play \"A Delicate Balance\" (1996). Her one-woman show \"Elaine Stritch at Liberty\", won the 2002 Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event.\n\nStritch relocated to London in the 1970s and starred in several West End productions, including Tennessee Williams' \"Small Craft Warnings\" (1973) and Neil Simon's \"The Gingerbread Lady\" (1974). She also starred with Donald Sinden in the ITV sitcom \"Two's Company\" (1975–79), which earned her a 1979 BAFTA TV Award nomination. She won an Emmy Award in 1993 for her guest role on \"Law & Order\" and another for the 2004 television documentary of her one-woman show. From 2007 to 2012, she had a recurring role as Colleen Donaghy on the NBC sitcom \"30 Rock\", a role that won her a third Emmy in 2007.\n\nStritch was born on February 2, 1925, in Detroit, Michigan, the youngest daughter of Mildred (née Jobe; 1893–1987), a homemaker, and George Joseph Stritch (1892–1987), an executive with B.F. Goodrich. She had two older sisters, Georgine and Sally. Her Roman Catholic family was well-off. Her father was of Irish descent, while her mother had Welsh ancestry. Cardinal Samuel Stritch, Archbishop of Chicago from 1940 to 1958, was one of her uncles. She trained at the Dramatic Workshop of The New School in New York City under Erwin Piscator, alongside Marlon Brando and Bea Arthur.\n\nStritch made her stage debut in 1944. However, her Broadway debut was in \"Loco\" in 1946, directed by Jed Harris, followed soon after by \"Made in Heaven\" (as a replacement) and then \"Angel in the Wings\" (1947), a revue in which she performed comedy sketches and the song \"Civilization\".\n\nStritch understudied Ethel Merman for \"Call Me Madam\", and, at the same time, appeared in the 1952 revival of \"Pal Joey\", singing \"Zip\". Stritch later starred in the national tour of \"Call Me Madam\", and appeared in a supporting role in the original Broadway production of William Inge's play \"Bus Stop\". In 1958 she originated the leading role of Maggie Harris in the musical \"Goldilocks\".\n\nShe starred in Noël Coward's \"Sail Away\" on Broadway in 1961. Stritch started in the show in a \"relatively minor role and was only promoted over the title and given virtually all the best songs when it was reckoned that the leading lady...although excellent, was rather too operatic for a musical comedy\". During out-of-town tryouts in Boston, Coward was \"unsure about the dramatic talents\" of one of the leads, opera singer Jean Fenn.\n\nJoe Layton suggested \"What would happen if...we just eliminated [Fenn's] role and gave everything to Stritch? The show was very old-fashioned, and the thing that was working was Elaine Stritch. Every time she went on stage [she] was a sensation.\" The reconstructed 'Sail Away' opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on October 3, 1961\", with Stritch giving what Howard Taubman of The New York Times said \"must be the performance of her career.\" In 1966, she played Ruth Sherwood in the musical \"Wonderful Town\" at New York's City Center, and appeared in an Off Broadway revival of \"Private Lives\" in 1968.\n\nStritch became known as a singer with a brassy, powerful voice. She was the original performer cast in the role of Joanne in Stephen Sondheim's \"Company\" (1970) on Broadway. After over a decade of successful runs in shows in New York, Stritch moved in 1972 to London, where she starred in the West End production of \"Company\". On tour and in stock, Stritch appeared in such musicals as \"No, No, Nanette\", \"The King and I\", \"I Married an Angel\", and both as Vera Charles (opposite Janet Blair) and Mame Dennis in \"Mame\".\n\nStrich's earliest television appearances were in \"The Growing Paynes\" (1949) and the \"Goodyear Television Playhouse\" (1953–55). She also appeared on episodes of \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1954. She was the first and original Trixie Norton in a \"Honeymooners\" sketch with Jackie Gleason, Art Carney and Pert Kelton. The character was originally a burlesque dancer, but the role was rewritten and recast after just one episode with the more wholesome looking Joyce Randolph playing the character as an ordinary housewife.\n\nStritch's other television credits included a number of dramatic programs in the 1950s and 1960s, including \"Studio One\". In the 1960 television season, Stritch appeared in the role of writer Ruth Sherwood in the CBS sitcom \"My Sister Eileen\", opposite Shirley Bonne as her younger sister, Eileen Sherwood, an aspiring actress. The sisters, natives of Ohio, live in a brownstone apartment in Greenwich Village. The one-season series aired opposite \"Hawaiian Eye\" on ABC and \"Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall\" on NBC.\n\nIn 1975, Stritch starred in the British LWT comedy series \"Two's Company\" opposite Sir Donald Sinden. She played Dorothy McNab, an American writer living in London who was known for her lurid and sensationalist thriller novels. Sinden played Robert, her English butler, who disapproved of practically everything Dorothy did and the series derived its comedy from the inevitable culture clash between Robert's very British stiff-upper-lip attitude and Dorothy's devil-may-care New York view of life. \"Two's Company\" was exceptionally well received in Britain and ran for four series until 1979. In 1979, both Stritch and Sinden were nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for \"Two's Company\", in the category \"Best Light Entertainment Performance\", losing out to Ronnie Barker. \n\nIn 1980, Stritch starred in another series for LWT, \"Nobody's Perfect\" (the British version of \"Maude\") - not to be confused with the 1980 American series of the same name, which aired in the UK as \"Hart Of The Yard\" - playing Bill Hooper alongside Richard Griffiths as her husband Sam. Unsatisfied with the Anglicised scripts, Stritch herself adapted the original American scripts for all but one of the fourteen episodes (Griffiths handled the remaining one).\n\nOther British television appearances by Strich included Roald Dahl's \"Tales of the Unexpected\". Although she appeared several times in different roles, perhaps her most memorable appearance was in the story \"William and Mary\", in which she played the wife of a man who has cheated death by having his brain preserved. She appeared on BBC 1's children's series, \"Jackanory\", reading, among other stories, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" by Roald Dahl.\n\nAfter returning to the United States, she appeared on \"The Edge of Night\" as vinegary nanny Mrs. DeGroot, then was cast as a regular on the short-lived \"The Ellen Burstyn Show\" in 1986. She appeared as the stern schoolteacher Mrs. McGee on three episodes of \"The Cosby Show\" (1989–90). She had a recurring role in \"Law & Order\" (1992, 1997) as Lanie Stieglitz. On April 26, 2007, she began guest appearances on the NBC sitcom \"30 Rock\" as Colleen, the fearsome mother of Alec Baldwin's lead character, Jack Donaghy. Her later roles included Judge Grace Lema on \"Oz\" (1998); and Martha Albright (mother of Jane Curtin's character) on two episodes of \"3rd Rock From the Sun\" (1997, 2001), alongside her Broadway co-star George Grizzard, who played George Albright.\n\nStritch was reportedly considered for the role of Dorothy Zbornak on \"The Golden Girls\" but, as she related in her show \"Elaine Stritch at Liberty\", she \"blew her audition\". The role was cast with Beatrice Arthur. She was seen on \"One Life to Live\" (1993), replacing fellow stage legend Eileen Heckart as Wilma Bern.\n\nStritch appeared in more films in her later years than the early part of her career. In an interview in 1988, it was noted that \"Making movies is challenging to Stritch since she considers herself a novice.\" She said: \"I'm fascinated with it. And I want to do more of them.\" She was asked why she waited so long to make movies since she apparently enjoys it so much. \"You do a movie for, like, three months and then you're finished. You do a part in a play and it's like going into a roomful of audiences for a year.\"\n\nEarly in her career, she appeared in \"Three Violent People\" (1956) starring Charlton Heston, as the hotel proprietor pal of Anne Baxter, and then co-starred opposite Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones in the David O. Selznick remake of \"A Farewell to Arms\" (1957) as Hudson's nurse. In \"The Perfect Furlough\", she co-starred opposite Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh. She had a showy role as the lesbian proprietor of a bar in the cult film \"Who Killed Teddy Bear?\" (1965), which starred Sal Mineo. She played a \"tough-as-nails\" nurse in the remake of \"The Spiral Staircase\" (1975) and was praised for her performance in \"Providence\" (1977).\n\nWhen she returned to the United States in the mid-1980s from London, Woody Allen cast her as the former movie star mother in his drama \"September\" (1987). \"People\" magazine called her performance \"acclaimed\" and wrote \"Though the movie has received mixed reviews, Stritch's roaring presence, like Godzilla in a stalled elevator, can't be ignored.\" Allen later cast her in his comedy \"Small Time Crooks\" (2000) in which she played a \"snobby socialite\". Rex Reed wrote of her performance: \"Elaine Stritch can still stop you in your tracks with a meaningless, drop-dead one-liner (which is all she gets here).\"\n\nShe joined the ensemble of \"\" (1988) as an apartment manager who helps widowed Jack Gilford get over his wife's death. Among her co-stars were former \"Goldilocks\" co-star Don Ameche and Gwen Verdon. She appeared in \"Out to Sea\" (1997) as Dyan Cannon's wise-cracking mother and \"danced up a storm\" with the other characters. She played Winona Ryder's loving grandmother in the film \"Autumn in New York\" (2000).\nStritch had a rare co-starring role in the comedy \"Screwed\" (2000), playing Miss Crock, who becomes the intended victim of a kidnapping by her disgruntled butler (Norm Macdonald). She appeared in the comedy \"Monster in Law\" (2005) starring Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda, playing Fonda's mother-in-law.\n\nIn 1982, Stritch appeared on an edition of the long-running BBC Radio comedy series \"Just a Minute\" alongside Kenneth Williams, Clement Freud and Barry Cryer. The show was described by long-time chairman Nicholas Parsons as being among the most memorable because of the way Stritch stretched the show's rules. She described Kenneth Williams as capable of making \"one word into a three-act play\". \n\nAfter her husband, John Bay, died from brain cancer in 1982, Stritch returned to America, and after a further lull in her career and struggles with alcoholism, Stritch began performing again. She appeared in a one-night only concert of \"Company\" in 1993 and as Parthy in a Broadway revival of the musical \"Show Boat\" in 1994.\n\nIn 1996 she played Claire in a revival of Edward Albee's \"A Delicate Balance\", with \"Variety\" writing: \"Equally marvelous is Stritch, with a meatier role than her recent foray as Parthy in \"'Show Boat\".' To watch her succumb to the vast amounts of alcohol Claire ingests, folding and refolding her legs, slipping – no, oozing – onto the floor, her face crumpling like a paper bag, is to witness a different but equally winning kind of thespian expertise. It's a master class up there.\"\n\nHer one-woman show \"Elaine Stritch at Liberty\", a summation of her life and career, premiered at New York's Public Theater, running from November 7 to December 30, 2001. It then ran on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre from February 21 to May 27, 2002, and then, also in 2002, at London's Old Vic Theatre. \n\"Newsweek\" noted:\n\nStritch appeared in the Broadway revival of the Sondheim-Wheeler musical \"A Little Night Music\" from July 2010 to January 2011, succeeding Angela Lansbury in the role of Madame Armfeldt, the wheelchair-bound mother who remembers her life as a courtesan in the song \"Liaisons\". The AP reviewer of the musical (with the two new leads) wrote \"Devotees of Stritch, who earned her Sondheim stripes singing, memorably, \"The Ladies Who Lunch\" in \"Company\" 40 years ago, will revel in how the actress, who earned a huge ovation before her very first line at a recent preview, brings her famously salty, acerbic style to the role of Madame Armfeldt.\"\n\nThe theatre critic for \"The Toronto Star\" wrote:\n\nStritch performed a cabaret act in New York City at the Cafe Carlyle in the Carlyle Hotel, where she was a resident from 2005 until she left New York in 2013. Her first show at the Carlyle was titled \"At Home at the Carlyle\". \"The New York Times\" reviewer wrote:\n\nBetween musical numbers, Stritch told stories from the world of stage and screen, tales from her everyday life and personal glimpses of her private tragedies and triumphs. She performed at the Cafe Carlyle in early 2010 and in fall 2011 in \"At Home at the Carlyle: Elaine Stritch Singin' Sondheim...One Song at a Time\".\n\nStrich was married to the actor John Bay from 1973 until his death in 1982. He was part of the family that owns the Bay's English Muffins company, and Stritch sent English muffins as gifts to friends. Said John Kenley: \"Every Christmas, she still sends me English muffins.\" When she was based in London, Stritch and her husband lived at the Savoy Hotel.\n\nShe was good friends with gossip columnist Liz Smith, with whom she shared a birthday (February 2). In March 2013, Stritch announced she was leaving New York and relocating to Birmingham, Michigan.\n\nStritch was candid about her alcoholism. She took her first drink at 14 and began using it as a crutch before performances to vanquish her stage fright and insecurities. Her drinking worsened after Bay's death, and she sought help after experiencing problems with the effects of alcoholism, including the onset of diabetes. \"Elaine Stritch at Liberty\" discusses the topic at length.\n\nStritch died in her sleep at her home in Birmingham, Michigan, on July 17, 2014. She was 89 years old. She suffered from diabetes and had stomach cancer. At the time of her death only three months after having had surgery for the disease, cancer was not cited as an immediate cause of her death.\n\nStritch's voice and vocal delivery are spoofed in the \"Forbidden Broadway\" songs \"The Ladies Who Screech\" and \"Stritch\", parodies of \"The Ladies Who Lunch\" and \"Zip\", songs she performed in the musicals \"Company\" and \"Pal Joey\".\n\nIn 2009, a parody by Bats Langley entitled \"How the Stritch Stole Christmas\" (loosely based on \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\") appeared on YouTube.\n\nOn \"The Big Gay Sketch Show\" in 2007, she was spoofed (and portrayed by Nicol Paone) as a Wal-Mart greeter who is still a theater gal at heart. In a later episode, Stritch is spoofed as an airport security guard, who's still \"on\" and isn't able to tone down her over-the-top antics. In yet another episode, \"Stritch\" is promoting her self-titled perfume \"Stritchy\" in dramatic fashion when she is confronted by the real-life Elaine Stritch, who makes a cameo appearance.\n\nOn \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" season 7 in 2015 during a drag granny mini challenge Pearl Liaison's drag granny is likened to Stritch. In season 9 in 2017 during introductions for the Snatch Game guest contestant Denis O'Hare's career accomplishments include having received a standing ovation from Stritch.\n\nMs. Stritch was the basis of the character Laney Fontaine on \"The Simpsons\".\n\nIn the \"Modern Family\" episode \"Schooled\", Mitch states that school was difficult for him because of having a name that rhymes with \"witch, snitch, bitch, Elaine Stritch\" to which he states that, \"Not all bullies are straight.\" \n\nStritch was an eight-time Emmy Award nominee (three wins), a four-time Tony Award nominee and a Grammy Award nominee.\n\"Elaine Stritch at Liberty\" won the Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event (awarded to its producers, of which Stritch was not one). The stage performance of observations and songs from her life in theatre would later be the focus of D. A. Pennebaker's 2004 documentary \"Elaine Stritch at Liberty\", which as well as the Emmy for Stritch, also won its producers the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Special.\n\nStritch was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nSources: FilmReference.com; Internet Broadway Database; TCM\n\n"}

William McGlothlin (1956) and Mukhtar Ali (1977) first discovered this effect after observing the shift in betting patterns at horserace tracks. Mcglothlin and Ali noticed that people are significantly more likely to prefer longshots to conservative bets on the last race of the day. They found that the movement towards longshots, and away from favorites, is so pronounced that some studies show that conservatively betting on the favorite to show (to finish first, second, or third) in the last race is a profitable bet despite the track’s take.\n\nExpected utility hypothesis cannot explain the shift in risk preferences across the day if bettors integrate their wealth because the last race of the day is not fundamentally different from the first. Prospect theory can explain the shift by assuming people open a mental account at the beginning of the day, close it at the end, and hate closing an account in the red.\n\nThe end-of-the-day betting effect is consistent with the risk aversion/risk seeking behaviors associated with prospect theory, which state that people are more likely to be risk averse in the case of gains and risk seeking in the case of losses. Prospect theory claims that people begin with zero daily profit as a reference point and gamble in the domain of losses to break even. Because the racetrack takes a hefty bite out of each dollar, most people are down money when the last races near. Anything below this target is regarded as a loss and triggers risk-seeking behavior in an attempt to break even. Diminishing sensitivity to successive losses means that the cost of the last bet is relatively trivial compared to what has already been spent. Betters refrain from making bets that would not recoup their losses if successful.\n\nJohn and Bob go to the casino to play roulette. After two hours of playing their wives tell them that they must leave after one more spin. John is up $200. Bob is down $320. The end-of-the-day betting effect says that John is more likely to make a low risk bet, such as betting on red or black (1:1 odds), while Bob is more likely to make a bet that can recoup his losses if he is successful, such as betting $10 on 3 single numbers (35:1 odds each).\n"}

Both the hat, and the surface it is placed on, will have a hidden opening in them, through which an object stored in a compartment in the table or chest can be pulled. Alternatively, the performer can produce an item hidden in their sleeve using sleight of hand and misdirection. This eliminates the need to place the hat on a surface, and also allows the performer to give the hat to an audience member for inspection. However, producing a rabbit from a hat using nothing but sleight of hand is a much more difficult trick.\n\nThis trick is also traditionally performed for children, since it is a basic trick with basic props.\n\nIt is said that the earliest magician to pull a rabbit out of a hat was Louis Comte, in 1814, though this is also attributed to the much later John Henry Anderson.\n\nThis magic trick is so well known that it has been referenced in a wide variety of media. The top hat used for the trick has become almost synonymous with stage magicians, and is commonly used as an icon to represent magic (such as the example on the right). Likewise, rabbits are so commonly associated with the trick that rabbits are often used to represent magic in general.\n"}

{"id": "3488154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3488154", "title": "I'll Say She Is", "text": "I'll Say She Is\n\nI'll Say She Is (1924) is a musical comedy revue written by brothers Will B. Johnstone (book and lyrics) and Tom Johnstone (music). It was the Broadway debut of the Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo). A revival of \"I'll Say She Is\", as \"adapted and expanded\" by the writer-performer Noah Diamond, was seen Off Broadway at the Connelly Theater in 2016.\n\n\"I'll Say She Is\" led to the Marxes' rise out of vaudeville and into stardom on the Broadway stage and later into motion pictures, and came at a time when they had gotten themselves effectively banned from the major vaudeville circuits owing to a dispute with E. F. Albee, and had failed in an attempt to produce their own shows on the alternate Shubert circuit.\n\nThe show included some Marx Brothers routines and musical specialties from their years in vaudeville, incorporated into a thin narrative about a rich girl looking for thrills, as presented to her by a succession of male suitors. The libretto and lyrics were written by Will B. Johnstone, who later co-wrote the classic Marx Brothers films \"Monkey Business\" (1931) and \"Horse Feathers\" (1932) with music by his brother, Tom Johnstone. The comedic high point was a long sketch featuring Groucho as Napoleon, which the Brothers regarded as the funniest thing they ever did. After touring for almost a year, the show opened on Broadway on May 19, 1924 at the Casino Theatre. It closed on February 7, 1925 after 313 performances.\n\nIt was a roaring success, and it catapulted the Marx Brothers to superstardom, accepted by the New York smart set of the Algonquin Round Table. Alexander Woollcott and Robert Benchley were among the theatre critics who made \"I'll Say She Is\" a smash, and George S. Kaufman would co-write their next two Broadway musicals, \"The Cocoanuts\" (1925) and \"Animal Crackers\" (1928). Unlike those shows, however, \"I'll Say She Is\" was never made into a film. A version of its opening scene, however, was made into a short for Paramount Pictures as part of a feature called \"The House That Shadows Built\" (1931), made to celebrate Paramount's 20th anniversary of their founding in 1912, and as a promotion for the then-upcoming Marx film \"Monkey Business\". An animated version of the Napoleon scene (with Groucho voicing himself) was incorporated into an ABC-TV special called \"The Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians\" (1970).\n\nThe first act begins with a song by the chorus called \"Do It\".\n\nAt its conclusion, the setting changes to the office of a talent agent, wherein Zeppo bursts through the door, proclaiming to be a great musical actor. He gives a terrible impression of a popular musical act of the day. (The act being imitated would change over the run of the show. Gallagher and Shean, Joe Frisco, and Charlie Chaplin are a few of its victims.)\n\nJust as the agent is about to kick Zeppo out, Chico arrives, also proclaiming to be a great musical talent, and gives an even worse impression of the same musical act. This is followed by Groucho, who wisecracks his way through his unsolicited audition. Finally, Harpo bursts in, who pantomimes his way through his take on the audition.\n\nAnother actor arrives, asking for a juvenile part, but he cannot do the impression the Brothers have just butchered. The agent invites him in. He then confides in the would-be actors that he has no jobs for them, but that there's \"a wealthy young lady who claims she will give her heart, her hand, and her fortune to the man who gives her the greatest thrill.\"\n\nHe then asks if they recall \"the old fable of the Richman, Poorman, Beggarman, Thief, Doctor, Lawyer, Merchant, Chief.\" The agent assigns himself as The Richman, and the rest of the cast will take the other parts, with each pursuing the wealthy young lady under the guise of the assigned role. This meager plot device ties the musical revue together.\n\nThe men arrive at the heiress's residence, much to the chagrin of the butler, who agrees to let them in.\n\nThe eight gentleman suitors, among them The Four Marx Brothers, enter the reception room of the heiress (known throughout as \"The Beauty\"). The men, each playing the roles of the aforementioned fable, attempt to woo her, but she states she needs a thrill in life. The Beauty requests that they each draw a number, to decide who gets the first chance to give her that thrill. In so doing, she takes the hand of The Chief, but doesn't let go. The Beauty and The Chief then sing the duet, \"Thrill of Love\" or \"Only You\". (The two songs were transposed between Acts I and II at some point during the run of the show.)\n\nFrom the drawing of numbers, The Richman draws the number one. But The Thief, being a thief, steals The Beauty and takes her to Chinatown.\n\nIn Chinatown, The Thief shows The Beauty all sorts of insidious thrills: terror, gunshots, and murder.\n\nThe Thief then takes The Beauty to an opium den. The Beauty says that she'll \"try anything once,\" and smokes opium. She falls asleep, which is followed by a \"Chinese Apache Dance\" number. At the end of the dance, one of the dancers falls dead.\n\nAn actor playing the role of a \"Chinaman\" sings \"San Toy\" and carries the dead dancer offstage. This is followed by a \"dream ship\" dance sequence. The Beauty awakes, with the Thief re-entering the scene, along with Groucho and a policeman. Groucho tells the policeman to arrest The Beauty, due to the death that has taken place.\n\nThe Beauty enters the courtroom, accused of murder. Harpo enters as the judge. Chico enters as the defense lawyer, but is mainly interested in playing cards with Harpo.\n\nGroucho enters as the district attorney, to try to convict The Beauty of murder. He accuses her of stabbing the \"Chinaman\" with a revolver, but she proclaims innocence, and counterattacks by telling the Brothers that after they left her reception room earlier, all her silverware had gone missing.\n\nA Detective then enters to inquire about three suits that were stolen from the judge's chambers. He quickly finds a plethora of stolen property on both Groucho and Chico. He then shakes Harpo's hand, wondering why an honest man keeps such bad company. While shaking his hand, the silverware stolen from The Beauty falls out of Harpo's coat, piece by piece.\n\nThe Beauty and The Chief appear before the curtain and make plans to meet later, after The Beauty has sought out more thrills.\n\nChorus members sing \"Rainy Day\".\n\nAnother song follows: a solo for one of the female chorus members called \"Wall Street Blues\".\n\nThe Beauty meets the Richman on Wall Street. The Beauty watches as The Richman invests in stock, and, also, takes a turn at gambling. Thinking that this may be the thrill she's seeking, The Beauty tries her hand at gambling as well, and eventually, The Richman tells her the biggest gamblers play the stock market.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Wall Street sequence, which ends the first act, an elaborate costumed ballet performs a dance interpretation of gambling. Photographs from the performance show dancers dressed as dice, coins, a roulette wheel, and a gold statue, not unlike the extravagant Busby Berkeley dance numbers seen in 1930s film.\n\nThe second act opens with an unknown song by The Melvin Sisters.\n\nZeppo takes his turn to woo The Beauty. He does so by giving her the thrill of clothing and jewels from foreign lands, each carried onstage by a chorus girl, with The Beauty trying on a plethora of the risque garments. This does nothing to thrill The Beauty, and Zeppo walks off, telling her:\n\nGroucho, dressed in a tutu and long underwear and smoking a pipe, enters from behind the curtain—an intentionally bad Fairy Godmother impersonation. The Beauty tells Groucho that she wants to experience the thrill of being poor, having been rich all her life. She then asks for him to take her to her Prince Charming, but Groucho refuses, since he has other Cinderellas he has to look after. He promises to be back at midnight, so The Beauty decides to call her Rolls Royce. Groucho tells her no, if she wants to experience being poor. She'll have to walk.\n\nIn early performances, a dance quartet performed a \"marathon dance number\" at this point in the revue. On Broadway, this was replaced by a Hawaiian dance featuring \"Sixteen Yankee Girls\".\n\nThe Chief and The Beauty meet at a marble fountain, with The Beauty wondering if The Chief is still pursuing her. They then sing \"Thrill of Love\" or \"Only You\". (The two songs were transposed between Acts I and II at some point during the run of the show.)\n\nA ballet of dancers portraying living statues performs a sequence called \"The Awakening of Love\". Groucho, Harpo, and Zeppo then parody this dance with their own dance number, referred to as \"The Death of Love\".\n\nChico claims to be a hypnotist, telling The Richman that he has just hypnotized The Beauty and she now thinks she is Josephine, wife of Napoleon. He then attempts to hypnotize The Richman himself with mixed results.\n\nThe Beauty enters as Josephine followed by Groucho as Napoleon. He calls for his faithful advisors—Francois, Alphonse, and Gaston—played by Chico, Zeppo, and Harpo, respectively. They appear, and they can barely hide their infatuation with The Beauty. Harpo makes no attempt to do so, ignoring Groucho's introduction altogether.\n\nGroucho questions The Beauty's love for him, but she doesn't understand. He leaves several times to go off to war, always coming back to say goodbye once more, or to fetch the sword he keeps forgetting. Each time he leaves, the other Brothers attempt to violently woo The Beauty, with Groucho alternately suspicious and oblivious to his advisors' advances to his wife. This becomes increasingly difficult for The Beauty to hide, as Harpo leaves his harp behind, and Chico, under cover, begins to sneeze. Eventually, Groucho discovers what is going on. The Beauty is afraid that Groucho will kill her, but he says he won't. Instead, he is going to sell the couch, which The Beauty finds even more upsetting than killing her.\n\nThe revue closes with another song and dance number, which changed over the life of the show. During its Broadway run, the song performed was called \"A Bit of Tango Jazz\".\n\nThe eight gentleman suitors then enter with The Beauty. The Beauty tells them that the contest is over. She has found the greatest thrill in life, and that thrill is love. And she has found the thrill of love with The Chief.\n\n\nThe show debuted at the Lyric Theatre in Allentown, Pennsylvania before opening in nearby Philadelphia in May 1923. It opened at the Casino Theatre in New York City on May 19, 1924. Legend has it that the first-string critics for the New York papers were slated to see a different show premiering at the Winter Garden Theatre the same night, and only came to \"I'll Say She Is\" when the other show was postponed at the last moment. However, as both the Winter Garden and the Casino were part of the Shubert chain, it seems more likely that the openings were deliberately set for different dates to avoid competing with each other. In any case, the critics, notably Alexander Woollcott, who was only at the show because his other engagements were canceled, raved about the show, especially Harpo's performance, and the Marx Brothers became first-rank stars virtually overnight.\n\nDespite the fact that the Marx Brothers were the stars of this show, because it was a revue, they are absent from significant parts of the performance. They are almost entirely absent from the musical numbers and do not appear at all in several scenes. Because of this, much of the material that they performed in \"I'll Say She Is\" exists in one form or another. The opening \"Theatrical Agency\" scene was later filmed for the Paramount Pictures release \"The House That Shadows Built\" almost in its entirety. Instead of Gallagher and Shean or Joe Frisco, they impersonate Maurice Chevalier in the filmed performance.\n\nThe penultimate Napoleon scene was filmed as a cartoon in 1970 by Rankin-Bass in their 30-minute television production \"The Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians\". Groucho performed his own voice for this recreation. Harpo and Chico had both died by then, so Chico's part was performed by Paul Frees, while Harpo's part, having no spoken lines, was replaced by sound effects. Reportedly, Groucho was impressed by the accuracy of Frees's performance as Chico.\n\nThe Marx Brothers' last Paramount film, \"Duck Soup\", contains a courtroom scene largely inspired by the one in \"I'll Say She Is\", although there are significant differences. The silverware gag in this scene was recycled for the stage performance of \"Animal Crackers\" and is also featured in the film of the same name.\n\nThis is also the last production by The Marx Brothers in which they were billed under their given names. Harpo was billed as Adolph Arthur, Zeppo as Herbert, Groucho as Julius Henry, and Chico as Leonard. In his autobiography \"Harpo Speaks\" (1961), Harpo wrote that theatre critic Alexander Woollcott encouraged the Brothers to use their stage names in any subsequent production, which they did, starting with their next Broadway show, \"The Cocoanuts\" (1925), which was later turned into a film version in 1929.\n\nHaving toiled on the Vaudeville circuit for nearly a quarter century, this would be the last stage performance that The Marx Brothers would perform for Vaudeville theaters. Once \"I'll Say She Is\" hit Broadway, they never left. They would have two further Broadway hits, \"The Cocoanuts\" and \"Animal Crackers\", which were then filmed in the early years of talking pictures as their first two feature films. With the closing of \"Animal Crackers\", their third and final Broadway show, the Marx Brothers moved to Hollywood, and enjoyed long careers in film and television.\n\nIn 2009, writer and performer Noah Diamond began to research and restore \"I'll Say She Is\", working from Johnstone's 30-page rehearsal typescript and numerous other sources to reconstruct the show. In May 2014, coinciding with the ninetieth anniversary of the show's Broadway opening, \"I'll Say She Is\" received two staged readings, in a new \"reconstruction\" and adaptation by Diamond, who had by then spent five years researching and expanding the work. A fuller staging was seen in August 2014 at the New York International Fringe Festival, featuring Melody Jane as Beauty, Noah Diamond as Groucho, Seth Shelden as Harpo, Robert Pinnock as Chico, Aristotle Stamat as Zeppo, and Kathy Biehl as Ruby. Both the Marxfest readings and the Fringe productions were co-produced and directed by Trav S.D.\n\nA full Off Broadway production opened at the Connelly Theater in June 2016, running for 3 previews and 23 performances. Directed by Amanda Sisk, it was well received by the New York press, receiving critic's pick from \"The New York Times\" and lauded by Adam Gopnik in \"The New Yorker\". Diamond and Shelden reprised their roles as Groucho and Harpo respectively, the British comedian Matt Roper played Chico, actor Matt Walters portrayed Zeppo, while Sabrina Chap arranged the score and worked as musical director and bandleader. A short film featuring interviews and cast rehearsals was featured in the \"Wall Street Journal\".\n\nHaving observed a rehearsal session of the famed 'Napoleon' sketch at New York's Pearl Studios, Gopnik wrote in the New Yorker:\n\n\"One sees at once why the Napoleon scene became legendary overnight—apart from still being extremely funny, it has the edge of randomness, the pure absurdity, that made the Marx Brothers seem, on that opening night as ever after, so \"modern\". Of the great movie comedians, Chaplin is rooted in Dickens and the nineteenth-century stage; Keaton, more cinematic, in a kind of melancholic Civil War stoicism. Only the Marxes seem contemporary with Dada. There is no logic or pathos or point or even much structure to it—the fourth wall is broken, then restored, and then broken again. Napoleon’s appearances and reappearances from the Russian front are as arbitrary as a Magritte drawing—and the scene’s moral, to the degree that it has one, is the nihilistic one that runs true in comedy from Aristophanes to Sid Caesar: all authority is always ridiculous, and man (and woman) runs by appetite alone. All of Monty Python’s non sequiturs and sudden stoppages—“the sketch is now over”—begin here, as does most of the pure burlesque aggression of a Mel Brooks, whose historical kidding, as in the “2000 Year Old Man” skits, starts here, too.\"\n\nA book \"Gimme a Thrill: The Story of I'll Say She Is, the Lost Marx Brothers Musical, and How it Was Found\" was published by BearManor Media in 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "32896635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32896635", "title": "Independent News", "text": "Independent News\n\nIndependent News Co. was a magazine and comic book distribution business owned by National Periodical Publications, the parent company of DC Comics. Independent News distributed all DC publications, as well as those of a few rival publishers, such as Marvel Comics from 1957 to 1969, in addition to pulp and popular magazines. The company was founded in 1932 and operated until c. 1970.\n\nIn 1929, as a favor to an old client, pulp magazine publisher Harry Donenfeld gave work to the client's son, Jack Liebowitz. Donenfeld and Liebowitz had little in common, but Liebowitz soon emerged as a man who could run finances. Whereas Donenfeld would promise the world to clients without understanding the economic realities, Liebowitz was bookish and ensured bills were paid on time and helped create a respectability in the firm. Soon the two men were spoken of as a partnership.\n\nWhen Liebowitz first worked for Donenfeld, the latter's empire was little more than a publishing house for \"sex pulp\" and art nudie magazines distributed by Eastern News, a company run by Charles Dreyfus and Paul Sampliner. In 1931, Eastern News faced bankruptcy and could no longer pay its publishers; the company owed Donenfeld alone $30,000. A compromise was called for, and Donenfeld, not wanting to find himself hamstrung by a distributor again, approached Sampliner with the idea of creating the Independent News Company, a publishing house with its own distribution system.\n\nWith Sampliner running the distribution end, Donenfeld as salesman, Harry's youngest brother Irving (not to be mistaken for Harry's son: Irwin Donenfeld ) as head printer, and Liebowitz running the finances, they launched Independent News in 1932. The Donenfeld brothers had begun as printers, and they continued printing the company's magazine and comic book covers even after branching into distribution.\n\nNow Donenfeld was a distributor as well as a publisher, and was now no longer reliant on others to run his business. As a publisher, Donenfeld had managed to dodge creditors and break deals, but as a distributor, he came to rely more on Liebowitz to ensure that the company ran smoothly. Liebowitz ensured bills were paid on time and began to build a trust with clients that Donenfeld's enterprises had never experienced.\n\nIn 1935, writer/entrepreneur Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson approached Independent News in a bid to relaunch his comic book \"New Fun\", having lost his previous backers due to poor sales and debts. Donenfeld accepted to distribute the comic but with heavy loss of rights to Wheeler-Nicholson. Wheeler-Nicholson produced two more titles to be handled by Independent News, \"New Comics\" and \"Detective Comics\" (which would later see the first appearance of Batman), now under the banner of Detective Comics Incorporated, in which Wheeler-Nicholson was forced to take Donenfeld and Liebowitz as partners. In 1938, Donenfeld sued Wheeler-Nicholson for nonpayment and Detective Comics Inc. went into bankruptcy. Not too surprisingly Donenfeld bought up the company and Wheeler-Nicholson's National Allied Publications in their entirety as part of the action.\n\nThe fourth publication under National Allied Publications would be \"Action Comics\" (1938). Issue #1 introduced the superhero, Superman, created by artist Joe Shuster and writer Jerry Siegel, and the character's popularity created incredible profits; not only in comic book sales, but also in merchandising such as toys, costumes and even a radio show. At the end of 1941 Donenfeld's comic businesses took in $2.6 million.\n\nMax Gaines, future founder of EC Comics, formed All-American Publications in 1938 after successfully seeking funding from Harry Donenfeld., As Gerard Jones writes of Donenfeld's investment:\nIn 1946, Gaines let Liebowitz buy him out, keeping only \"Picture Stories from the Bible\" as the foundation of his own new company, EC Comics. \"Liebowitz promptly orchestrated the merger of All-American and Detective Comics into National Comics... Next he took charge of organizing National Comics, Independent News, and their affiliated firms into a single corporate entity, National Periodical Publications\".\n\nThe biggest magazine distribution company of this era was American News Company, which had a virtual monopoly on all comics except DC's. From 1952 to 1957 Atlas Comics publisher Martin Goodman distributed his company's comics to newsstands through his self-owned distributor, Atlas. He then switched to American News — which shortly afterward lost a Justice Department lawsuit and discontinued its business. Atlas was left without distribution and was forced to turn to its biggest rival, National (DC) Comics. As then-Atlas editor Stan Lee recalled in a 1988 interview:\nAmerican Comics Group, another comic book publisher from the era (also with ties to Harry Donenfeld), was distributed by Independent News, as were such popular magazines as \"Playboy\" and \"Family Circle\".\n\nJack Liebowitz stayed with Independent News until 1965, eventually becoming a co-owner. Irwin Donenfeld, who was DC's editorial director in the 1960s, was also a vice president of Independent News.\n\nIn 1967, National Periodical Publications (including Independent News) was purchased by Kinney National Company, which later purchased Warner Bros.-Seven Arts and became Warner Communications. The Donenfelds and their \"crew\" were out, and new management came in. By 1970, Independent News was defunct, absorbed into a larger and changing distribution business. Independent News' last president was Harold Chamberlin, who served from 1968-1970. Chamblerin went on to become president of Warner Publishing from 1970–1979. As Warner Publishing Services, the company was named by DC Comics as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication \"Fifty Who Made DC Great\".\n\n"}

It was loosely based on the book \"Inside U.S.A.\" by John Gunther. Sketches were written by Arnold M. Auerbach, Moss Hart, and Arnold B. Horwitt.\n\nThe revue opened on Broadway at the New Century Theatre on April 30, 1948, transferred to the Majestic Theatre on September 23, 1948, and closed on February 19, 1949 after a total of 399 performances.\n\nThe sketches were directed by Robert H. Gordon, dances and Musical numbers were staged by Helen Tamiris, the production design was by Lemuel Ayers, costume design was by Eleanor Goldsmith, Beatrice Lillie's costumes and gowns were by Castillo and mask design was by John Robert Lloyd. The cast included Jack Haley, Beatrice Lillie, Valerie Bettis, Talley Beatty, Jack Cassidy, John Tyers, Jane Lawrence, Carl Reiner, and Nellie Hill.\n\nThe revue consists of a number of sketches related only in that they generally focus on a particular State. The opening is a serenade to the United States by the company (\"Inside USA\"). Lillie provides a \"mocking madrigal\" that praises the industry in Pittsburgh (\"Come, Oh Come to Pittsburgh\"). A woman loses her boyfriend to the horses at Churchill Downs (\"Blue Grass\"). In one sketch, a superstitious maid unnerves an actress on a Broadway opening night, using a ouija board and numerology (written by Moss Hart). New Orleans is featured in \"At The Mardi Gras\", with Lillie as the Queen. Wisconsin is featured in \"First Prize At The Fair.\" Lillie and Haley, costumed as New Mexico Indians, declare \"We Won't Take It Back.\" The romantic \"Rhode Island Is Famous For You\" turns into a ragtime number and names the most famous products of various states. In the Western number \"My Gal Is Mine Once More\" a cowboy celebrates remarriage to his first wife.\nHaley teaches apprentice waiters to make dining customers unhappy. Lillie is the \"priggish, unimaginative leader of a choral society\" and a mermaid with a strange romantic life. Herb Shriner, without harmonica, provides a wry Western themed monologue as \"A Feller from Indiana.\"\n\nSources: Playbill Vault;\n\n\nThe biggest success from the musical was \"Haunted Heart\", with which Perry Como and Jo Stafford had hit recordings. It was also the title track of an 2005 album by Renee Fleming.\n\nBlossom Dearie recorded \"Rhode Island is Famous For You.\"\n\nReviews were favorable from Brooks Atkinson of \"The New York Times\" (\"keen and impeccable\") and Robert Coleman of the \"Daily Mirror\" (\"a handsome hit\"). However, the only song that became a hit was \"Haunted Heart\". A strike by ASCAP delayed the recording and radio play from the show, which may have been the reason for the lack of more hit songs. The \"Time Magazine\" reviewer wrote that the revue was the \"least enjoyable Bea Lillie show in a long time. Not that it is really bad or botched: it is all thoroughly professional. It is also thoroughly unoriginal and unexhilarating; it not only fails to shed light of its own, but even dims the cherished Lillie luster.\"\n\n\nA television show titled Inside U.S.A. With Chevrolet, was based on this revue, with music, comedy, and dance that showed different states. The TV show aired on the CBS network from September 29, 1949 through March 16, 1950, with Schwartz and Dietz providing original music and Peter Lind Hayes the Master of Ceremonies, with name guest stars. Margaret O'Brien was the first guest and Joan Blondell the last, with Lucille Ball and Ethel Merman also guesting.\n\n\"Inside U.S.A.\"'s original cast recording was recorded before the production was fully cast in order to beat the 1948 ASCAP strike. The 1948 musical revue 'Inside U.S.A.' was commemorated with a 78 rpm album consisting of four records released by RCA Victor Records featuring the show's principals, Beatrice Lillie and Jack Haley, as well as performances by non-cast member Billy Williams and Perry Como's hit recording of \"Haunted Heart.\" Russ Cass and his Orchestra provided the music.\n\n"}
{"id": "32276892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32276892", "title": "Jaiva", "text": "Jaiva\n\nJaiva, or township jive (TJ), is a subgenre of South African township music and African dance form that influenced Western breakdance and emerged from the shebeen culture of the apartheid-era townships.\n\nWhile closely associated with mbaqanga, Township Jive more broadly incorporates influences from mariba and kwaito, and is synonymous with none of these. To the extent that mariba influences TJ, it may be somewhat sanitised as TJ broke into the international commercial arena.\n\nThe Boyoyo Boys received additional press coverage when Malcolm McLaren allegedly plagiarised their song \"Puleng\" and released it as the hit \"Double Dutch\", capitalising on the emergence of breakdance and hip-hop.\n\nAdditional momentum for world beat attention to South African music developed as a result of international attention to the demise of apartheid and Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday concert in Wembley Stadium, London in 1988.\n\nAccording to Ambrose Ehirim, a US-based Nigeria specialist, township music dates to the 1950s when it was proscribed by South African police. This has been contradicted by anti-apartheid activist/musician Johnny Clegg, who has claimed that \"by the 1960s, the development of umbaqanga hadn't even really started\". Mbaqanga (or Umbaquanga) has been characterised as urban pop music \"with high-pitched, choppy guitar and a powerful bass line\" influenced by \"funk, reggae, American R&B, soul and drawing on South African Marabi, gospel music\". It draws on both kweli and maribi.\n\nTownship Jive is closely associated with the development of mbaqanga but is more closely associated with emergent international trends and not as insular and rooted in tradition. Christopher Ballantine traces the \"shift from imitating American jazz to localizing the sound with African features. This he connects to the emergence of the ideology of New Africanism\". While the international market was absorbing Township Jive under the swirl of commercial activity culminating in the McLaren copyright infringement lawsuit, the subsequent release of BBoys' new album was preferred by a more elite audience closely associated with the black diaspora consciousness movements.\n\nThe homogenisation of Township Jive with US and UK culture, due to globalisation, is viewed by African artists as a threat to the preservation of their local tradition and credibility. Thus, artists focus on maintaining an emotional link between customer and brand. This explains why transnational corporations are much less interested in homogenising or Americanizing kwaito music because true kwaito represents and dictates South African experience. Americanizing kwaito, as is many artists' opinion, can potentially dilute the substance kwaito was originally based on.\n\nOn the upside, critical awareness of TJ has enhanced appreciation of fusion artists and others influenced by its style. For instance, Vibration Bookings bills its artist Nomfusi as a proponent of \"a new style where South African Township Jive (\"Jaiva\") meets Motown\". And the Boyoyo Boys have, subsequent to the copyright scandal, signed by Rounder Records which released \"TJ Today\" in 1998.\n\n\n\n"}

The 2006 edition was the first to feature a number of linked events (so called \"pre-selections\") in countries outside France with the finals being held in Paris. This allowed Juste Debout to reach a larger and more international audience.\n\nJuste Debout 2007 was held on February 25 in Paris and featured international pre-selections starting as early as January in countries such as Germany, Italy, Japan, Czech Republic, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

A battle finishes when each dancer has performed two times, resulting in a total of eight rounds, usually around a minute long each. Sometimes a team chooses to spontaneously replace or extend one of their rounds with a choreographed routine performed together for added effect, which is allowed. After each battle, a group of four judges decides the winning team, which moves them closer to the finals.

{"id": "1435569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1435569", "title": "Karagiozis", "text": "Karagiozis\n\nKaragiozis or Karaghiozis (, Turkish; \"Karagöz\") is a shadow puppet and fictional character of Greek folklore, originating in the Turkish shadow play Karagöz and Hacivat. He is the main character of the tales narrated in the Turkish and Greek shadow-puppet theatre.\n\nShadow theatre, with a single puppeteer creating voices for a dialogue, narrating a story, and possibly even singing while manipulating puppets, appears to come ultimately from the Indonesian wayang kulit or Chinese \"pi ying xi\" Shadow play.\n\nThe name Karagiozis or Karaghiozis is from Greek Καραγκιόζης, borrowed from Turkish Karagöz 'dark eye'.\n\nThere are several stories of how shadow theater was established in Asia Minor. Many argue for a Mediterranean origin in the Egyptian shadow puppet tradition. Whatever the case, it is worthwhile to mention that regardless of religious restrictions, shadow theater became more widespread around the 16th century among the Muslim Turks.\n\nOriginally, his popular appeal was his scatological language and protruding phallus. It is still performed in Turkey, especially during Ramadan celebrations, under the same name. \n\nKaragiozis seems to have come to mainland Greece, probably from Asia Minor (Anatolia) at the 19th century, during Ottoman rule. Karagiozis was hellenized in Patras, Greece in the end of 19th century by Dimitrios Sardounis alias \"Mimaros\", who is considered the founder of modern Greek shadow theater.\n\nThe genre became a fully integrated, though adapted, amongst the Greek population. But there are several legends as well as studies surrounding Karagiozis's arrival and subsequent popularity in Greece. Some stories say that Greek merchants brought the art from China and others say that it was a Greek who created the \"legend\" during Ottoman rule for the entertainment of the sultan. Yet others believe that it originated from real events involving two masonry workers named Karagöz and Haci Ivat working in the construction of a mosque in the city of Bursa, Turkey in early 14th century.\n\nKaragiozis is a poor hunchbacked Greek, his right hand is always depicted long, his clothes are ragged and patched, and his feet are always bare. He lives in a poor cottage (Greek: παράγκα) with his wife Aglaia and his three sons, during the times of the Ottoman Empire. The scene is occupied by his cottage in the left, and the Sultan's Palace (Sarayi) on the far right. \n\nBecause of his poverty, Karagiozis uses mischievous and crude ways to find money and feed his family.\n\nStudents of folklore divide Karagiozis' tales in two major categories: the 'Heroics' and the 'Comedies'. The Heroics are tales based on tradition or real stories involving the times under Ottoman rule, and Karagiozis is presented as a helper and assistant of an important hero.\n\nPuppeteers devise their own original tales, however there are many 'traditional' tales that have descended orally from earlier puppeteers and are accepted as 'canon' with slight alterations between the players. Most of them are formulaic and have the following layout (but with a wide improvisational variety), and often involving interaction with the audience:\n\n\nSome of the most known tales are:\n\n\nSome players have introduced other characters, like Karagiozis's old father and Nontas, Stavrakas' friend.\n\nAll the figures that represent the characters of the shows are two dimensional and designed always in profile. They were traditionally made from camel skin, carved to allow light through the image, creating details, but are today most often made of cardboard. Traditional puppets gave off black shadows against the white screen, but some more recent puppets have holes covered with colored silk or plastic gel materials to create colored shadows. The torso, waist, feet and sometimes the limbs, were separate pieces that were joined together with pins. Most figures were composed of two parts (torso and legs) with only one joint to the waist. Two characters, the Jew and Morfonios had joints in the neck, and had a flexible head.\nThey were moved with a stick attached to their 'back', except in the case of the figure of Karagiozis, Stavrakas and a few other characters whose arms or other limbs required separate movement. The 'scene' was a vertical white parapet, usually a cloth, called \"mperntes\" (from Turk. 'perde', curtain). Between the figures and the player (who was invisible), were candles or lamps that shed light to the figures and made their silhouettes and colours visible to the audience through the cloth.\n\nConrad, also known as \"Karaghiosis\", the protagonist of Roger Zelazny's \"...And Call Me Conrad\" (also known as \"This Immortal\"), which won the 1966 Hugo Award for Best Novel, is partially inspired by this character.\n\nIn Greek daily speech, the name Karagiozis is also used as an insult more or less like \"clown\". Puppeteers complain about this, saying that while Karagiozis can be violent, mischievous, a liar and an anti-hero, he is also good-natured and faithful, so his name should not be used as an insult.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Greek Television had Karagiozis shows on a weekly basis. These shows had more modern and educational themes, like for example Karagiozis living some myths of Greek mythology or visiting the moon and other planets. Some of these episodes were either live with an audience, or filmed especially for the TV show and contained scenes that required editing or special effects.\n\nThere have been several recent attempts to make Karagiozis incarnations in comic books. Since the 2000s, Karagiozis is not so popular as a choice of recreation for young kids and the number of puppeteers has diminished, but remains a significant and well known folkloric figure. Today, he is performed mostly in folk feasts or festivals and on national Greek television. There are also occasional tours in the Greek diaspora.\n\n\n"}

Universal Pictures, 603 P.2d 425 (Cal. 1979), was a decision of the Supreme Court of California respecting the personality rights of celebrities, particularly addressing whether these rights descended to the celebrities' heirs. The suit was brought by the heirs of Béla Lugosi, who sued Universal Pictures in 1966 for using his personality rights without the heirs' permission. The trial court ruled in favor of the Lugosi heirs, but Universal Studios won the case in an appeal. The court determined that a dead person had no right to their likeness, and any rights that existed did not pass to his heirs.\n\nIn September 1930, Béla Lugosi and Universal Pictures had entered into an agreement for the production of the film \"Dracula\" in which Lugosi played the title role under a signed contract. Hope Linninger Lugosi, his widow, and Bela George Lugosi, his son, filed a complaint against Universal on February 3, 1966, alleging that they were the heirs of Béla Lugosi and that Universal had, commencing in 1960, appropriated and continued to appropriate property which they had inherited from Lugosi and which was not part of the agreement with Universal. The Lugosis asserted that from 1960 until the present time, Universal entered into many licensing agreements which authorized the licensees to use the Count Dracula character.\n[Lugosi heirs] seek to recover the profits made by [Universal Studios] in its licensing of the use of the Count Dracula character to commercial firms and to enjoin [Universal Studios] from making any additional grants, without [their] consent ... The action, therefore, raises the question of whether Béla Lugosi had granted to [Universal] in his contracts with [Universal] merchandising rights in his movie portrayal of Count Dracula, the nature of such rights, and whether any such rights, if retained by Béla Lugosi, descended to the [Lugosi heirs] ...\nAfter eleven years of litigation, the trial judge ruled in favor of the Lugosi heirs, and awarded them $70,000 and barred Universal Studios from merchandising Lugosi's likeness. The decision was appealed and the California Supreme Court ruled that \"the right to exploit one's name and likeness is personal to the artist and must be exercised, if at all, by him during his lifetime.\" The result was a loss for the concept of inheriting personality rights in California.\n\nThe California Celebrities Rights Act of 1986 created an inheritable right to a person's name or likeness for 70 years after death. Legislation passed in 2007 extended that right retroactively to all persons who have died since January 1, 1938.\n\n\n"}

Wodehouse, music by Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern and others, and lyrics by Harry B. Smith, Otto Harbach, Henry Blossom and others. Made up of a string of vignettes, the show features songs from such musicals as \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Three Twins\", \"Babes in Toyland\", \"Ziegfeld Follies\" and \"The Belle of New York\".\n\nIn 1916, Charles Dillingham and Florenz Ziegfeld produced \"The Century Girl\", with music by Irving Berlin. Despite mildly positive reviews, the show closed without recouping its investment. On their next production, which was to be called \"Miss 1917\", they hired Jerome Kern and Victor Herbert to compose the score and Guy Bolton and P.G. Wodehouse to collaborate on the book. Kern and Bolton had collaborated on the Princess Theatre musicals, including \"Very Good Eddie\" (1915). British humorist and playwright Wodehouse then joined them for several innovative musicals there, including Oh, Boy! (1917).\n\nThe show is mostly known today as George Gershwin's introduction to musical theatre. During rehearsals for \"Miss 1917\", Gershwin conducted the pit orchestra and played the piano. He was hired in October 1917, being paid $35 each week. As the rehearsal period extended, Gershwin earned more money. He would later record Kern's \"The Land Where the Good Songs Go\", which was used in the revue, as a piano roll in January 1918.\n\nWhile working for the show, Gershwin and his brother Ira Gershwin befriended Herbert and Kern, keeping \"in contact with some of the major figures on Broadway\". Sunday night concerts held in New York City by the show's cast introduced Gershwin's \"There's More to a Kiss Than the Sound\" and \"You-oo, Just You\", both with lyrics by Irving Caesar. \"Gershwin had begun work on Broadway as a rehearsal pianist for the Jerome Kern and Victor Herbert musical \"Miss 1917\". Within months, his talent as a composer was noticed by everyone in the show and he was quickly put under contract by Harms Music. His involvement with \"Miss 1917\" brought him to the attention of music producer Harry Askins, who in turn mentioned him to Max Dreyfus, \"one of the giants of music publishing\".\n\nThe producers of the show \"had demanded extremely elaborate staging for the revue\", so no out-of-town tryouts were held, and the show premiered directly on Broadway on 5 November 1917, at the Century Theatre. The production was staged, directed and supervised by Ned Wayburn, with choreography by Adolph Bohm. The creative team also included set designer Joseph Urban, who built a rotating thrust stage for the theatre. Costume design was attributed to eight designers, including Paul Chaflin, Willy Pogany, and Max Weldy.\n\nThe original cast starred comedian Lew Fields, Andrew Tombes and Vivienne Segal. it also included George White, Ann Pennington, Charles King, Bessie McCoy Davis, Bert Savoy, Irene Castle, Marion Davies, Lilyan Tashman and the comedic team Van and Schenck. Kern originally wanted Segal to sing \"They Didn't Believe Me\" in the revue, though Dillingham and Herbert preferred her to sing \"Kiss Me Again\". Segal's siding with the latter caused tension among the creative team. According to a member of the production crew, technical rehearsals were interrupted several times due to disagreements in staging and choreography; at one point, Kern sought to close the show early, though Ziegfeld wouldn't have it.\n\nThe show got rave reviews. Although Castle was singled out for praise by reviewers, she was unhappy performing on stage without her husband and usual dance partner Vernon Castle: \"I found myself hopelessly lost as a solo number. I had no training for dancing alone and I should never have tried it.\" Though successful with critics, the revue failed to attract an audience; at least not enough of one to pay for the lavish production. Castle, White and others were let go by the producers, but the show still foundered in its out-of-the-way theatre. It closed on 5 January 1918, after only six weeks of performances.\n\nA month after \"Miss 1917\" closed on Broadway, on 21 February 1918, items used in the show were sold in an auction, raising $11,300, according to \"The New York Times\". Most of the items for auction were bought by J. J. Shubert. The following day, Sam Harrison of the New Amsterdam Theatre bought the performing rights to the musical. A London transfer, planned for March 1920, as well as a US national tour were cancelled. According to \"The New York Times\", the creative team would not allow Ziegfeld to stage the show internationally due to planned major staging and plot changes that he hoped would make the humour more accessible to international audiences.\n\n\nAlthough no official cast recording was made, brief excerpts from some of the songs used in \"Miss 1917\" can be heard on the compilation album, \"Jerome Kern: Silver Linings\", which was officially released on 22 July 2008.\n\n\n"}

The series follows the exploits of the Los Angeles–based Office of Special Projects (OSP), an elite division of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service that specializes in undercover assignments. \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" is the first spin-off of the successful series \"NCIS\". On March 23, 2017, CBS renewed the series for a ninth season which premiered on October 1, 2017. Nia Long joined the cast as Shay Mosley for the ninth season after Miguel Ferrer's death. On April 18, 2018, CBS renewed the series for a tenth season, which premiered on September 30, 2018.\n\n\"NCIS: Los Angeles\" follows Special Agent G. Callen (Chris O'Donnell), a \"legend\" assigned to the Office of Special Projects (OSP), a fictitious branch of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (the real-life NCIS has no offices in Los Angeles). Callen leads an elite team of undercover operatives as they battle enemies both foreign and domestic under the watchful eye of Operational Manager Henrietta \"Hetty\" Lange (Linda Hunt). The team is composed of Agent Kensi Blye (Daniela Ruah), a hand-to-hand combat specialist and forensic whiz, Sam Hanna (LL Cool J), a former Navy SEAL and G's partner, technical analyst (Barrett Foa), and ranking team member Shay Mosley (Nia Long), NCIS Executive Assistant Director for Pacific Operations (EAD-PAC).\n\nOver the course of the series, the team are assisted by allies from both NCIS and its local counterparts, including LAPD liaison officer Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen), Intelligence Analyst Nell Jones (Renee Felice Smith), Operational Psychologist Nate Getz (Peter Cambor), and rookie field agent Dominic Vail (Adam Jamal Craig), all of whom work side-by-side with NCIS Assistant Director Owen Granger (Miguel Ferrer), a laconic agent and skilled bureaucrat.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Agent G. Callen was initially a CIA operative created by Shane Brennan for a series that was never produced. After taking over show runner duties previously held by Donald P. Bellisario on \"NCIS\", he used the potential of a spin-off to bring his story to fruition.\n\nBrennan intended for the series to hold a \"Miami Vice\"-esque vibe through its two co-leads, Callen and Agent Sam Hanna. However, the character of Lara Macy was written to serve as a parallel for Gibbs, the lead of the original NCIS team. Macy was portrayed by Louise Lombard in the backdoor pilot, but she was not featured in the actual spin-off, and Brennan was able to produce the show as he originally envisioned it.\n\nThe show was known as \"NCIS: Legend\" while in production ( in which the spin-off was introduced), and other names considered included \"OSP: Office of Special Projects\", \"NCIS: OSP\" and \"NCIS: Undercover\". Filming started in February 2009, with the characters being introduced in the two-part \"NCIS\" episode titled \"Legend\", the first part of which aired on April 28, 2009. This episode served as a backdoor pilot for the series, in a manner similar to the way \"NCIS\" was introduced by way of a two-part episode of \"JAG\".\n\n\"Identity\", the series' first episode, garnered 18.73 million viewers with a 4.4/11 share in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic and therefore won its timeslot. It was the second most watched show of the week, behind only the original \"NCIS\".\n\nReviews for the show have been mixed. It has a score of 59/100 on Metacritic. According to Mary McNamara of the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The crime is intriguing and multifaceted, its resolution requiring a nice balance of street smarts and lots of gunfire. But as with the original \"NCIS\", the emphasis is on the characters of the team... Los Angeles, meanwhile, looks fabulous, a pleasing mixture of noir and gridlock, and there's an air of stability that's comforting in these uncertain times.\" The New York \"Daily News\" reviewer, David Hinckley, was more critical of the show saying that although \"It all adds up to an hour of decent entertainment, and there's room for enough character development to give \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" a personality of its own, ... a premiere episode shouldn't feel even a little like something we've already seen.\"\n\nTom Shales of \"The Washington Post\" felt that, \"NCIS: Los Angeles gets the job done ... It's a procedural that follows strictly the established procedure, but it has likable characters, dislikable bad guys and the occasional flabbergasting shot of L.A.\" Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" summarized it as a \"serviceable hour that takes the NCIS formula—a light tone and a lot of banter wrapped around a fairly rudimentary investigatory plot—and transfers it to a special, undercover NCIS division in Los Angeles. Nothing more, but also nothing less.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" compared the show to \"The A-Team\" with \"the same lighthearted approach to life-or-death situations. Maybe the biggest change is that 'NCIS: L.A.' achieves its inevitably favorable outcomes with a little more intellect and a little less testosterone.\" IGN stated that although \"\"NCIS: Los Angeles\" doesn't exactly reinvent the police procedural... it's another above-average entry, aided by the fact that the people behind the show know what they're doing\" and ultimately gave the episode a 7.7/10.\n\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" on CBS.\n\nOn November 5, 2012, Deadline Hollywood reported the first news about a spin-off of \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" titled \"NCIS: Red\". The new characters were introduced during a of \"NCIS: Los Angeles\". The spin-off was to feature a team of mobile agents, who travel around the country to solve crimes. This would have been the second successive spin-off in the \"NCIS\" franchise. However, on May 15, 2013, CBS confirmed that \"NCIS: Red\" was officially passed on and would not be moving forward. Scott Grimes reprised his potential spinoff role as NCIS Red Agent Dave Flynn during the eighth season of \"NCIS: Los Angeles\".\n\nThe first six seasons have been released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4, and Season 1 was released on Blu-ray Disc in Region A. The first season DVD release includes the two-part pilot episode that aired as part of the sixth season of \"NCIS\", which were also included on the Season 6 DVD of \"NCIS\". All releases are distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment.\n\nIn Asia, the series airs on AXN. In the UK the series airs on Sky 1 and on Channel Five. In the Netherlands the series airs on SBS 6. \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" airs on Network Ten, ONE and TVH!TS (formerly TV1) in Australia.\nIn Portugal the series airs on FOX. and on M6 in France.\n\nIn August 2016, Titan Books published \"NCIS Los Angeles: Extremis\", a novel by Jerome Preisler.

{"id": "56676228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56676228", "title": "Playbour", "text": "Playbour\n\nPlaybour (sometimes spelled playbor) is a term used to describe a hybrid form of play and labour, specifically in the digital games industry. The term was coined by Julian Kücklich in 2005 in his article \"Precarious playbour: Modders and the digital games industry.\" Kücklich describes playbour as a type of free labour that fits neither traditional definitions of work nor the categories of play or leisure. Nevertheless, forms of playbour are often incorrectly perceived as being just an extension of play. Playbour is also sometimes categorized as a part of the gamification of society in general.\n\nWhile the term playbour itself is a relatively new invention, the phenomena it concerns – those of productive leisure and free labour in the digital games industry – have been around at least since the late 1990s. Kücklich states that since the early 1990s, the relationship between the players of digital games and the digital games industry has changed substantially. He attributes the alteration to the rise of computer game modification, or \"modding\", as a widespread practice among players.\n\nCreating mods for digital games is the perfect example of playbour: a growing number of consumers of digital games are not satisfied with just playing the game, but prefer to enhance their playing experience by creating content for the game themselves. In modding we can see the very essence of playbour, or free labour: while the work of creating a modification can be seen as playful and enjoyable, it is still work. In this respect modding can be fairly similar to another form of collaborative digital production; open-source software development. The first game to gain a modder base of considerable size is widely agreed to be Doom (1993). The emergence of Doom mods is usually attributed to the fact that the game's code was deliberately designed to facilitate player-created content. The most famous modder creation is probably Counter-Strike, originally a team-based mod for Half-Life (1998). It later also became the first commercially released mod.\n\nNot only is modding a big part of gaming culture, but it is also an increasingly important source of value for the digital games industry. Game companies usually retain the intellectual property rights of the modifications. Since players need to have a copy of the original game to run the modifications, mods may add to the shelf-life of the product. In addition to that, mods may help with establishing brands (e.g. Counter-Strike), thus saving companies a significant amount of money. Marketing costs often take up a large percentage of a game's budget, but successfully established brands require less marketing. Mods also increase customer loyalty and are an important source of innovation in the digital games industry. Another way that game companies can benefit from the modding culture is that they can recruit modders as employees who are already trained at no cost to the company.\n\nWhile game companies may benefit economically from playbour, the players doing the work are not entirely uncompensated: they may obtain virtual in-game rewards or social capital such as followers on social media. The experience of play also has value in itself. Playbour is a voluntary activity and players don't usually view modding as labour. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that playboures are exploited by the games industry.\n\n"}

Promos are normally sent directly to broadcasters, such as music radio and television stations, and to tastemakers, such as DJs and music journalists, in advance of the release of commercial editions, in the hope that airplay, reviews, and other forms of exposure will result and stimulate the public's interest in the commercial release.\n\nPromos are often distributed in plain packaging, without the text or artwork that appears on the commercial version. Typically a promo is marked with some variation of the following text: \"Licensed for promotional use only. Sale is prohibited.\" It may also state that the promo is still the property of the distributor and is to be \"returned upon demand.\" However, it is not illegal to sell promotional recordings, and recalls of promos are extremely rare and unenforced.\n\nBecause promos are produced in smaller quantity than releases made available to the general public, they are sometimes considered valuable collectors' items. They are never intended for sale in record stores.\n\nA \"promotional single\" is a single that is made available to radio stations, nightclubs, music publications, and other media outlets by a record label to promote a commercial single or album. A song may be released as a promotional single even if no commercial version of the single is available to buy. While intended specifically for use by professional disc jockeys and not for resale, they are frequently sought out by music collectors nonetheless.\n\nThe promo single is usually recognized by its limited liner notes and cover artwork as well as its unique catalog number (or the occasional lack thereof). Quite often, vinyl records will be issued in a generic cardboard jacket or white paper sleeve while CDs will be issued in a slimline jewel case or cardboard sleeve.\n\nThere may also be promotion-specific terms stamped on the disc or its cover, most notably \"For Promotional Use Only\" and \"Not For Resale.\"\n\nThe \"advance promo single\" is furnished to DJs sometimes weeks or months in advance of a domestic release to give record labels an opportunity to build interest in the single and gauge response to the single. Unlike a finished promo single, these are commonly test pressings or white labels and thus are manufactured in limited runs. Traditionally, these promotional copies were supplied to DJs through music pools. Despite the good intention, there has been some dispute within the industry whether an advanced promotion is a good thing or not. Building interest is naturally a good thing, but it may have the opposite effect when interested persons are unable to find a new song in the record stores for quite some time.\n\nIn music, a buzz single or advance single is a track or promotional song, released by the label (typically) preceding the album's release. The song(s) are released in order to bring attention to an album's release. Buzz singles are not typically issued to radio as promotional singles, due to the fact that they are only intended to attract minor attention compared to a regular single.\n\nOn rare occasions a special type of demonstration record known as an acetate disc has been distributed to radio stations as a promo. Instead of being mass-produced these records are cut one at a time in the recording studio from a master tape source. They were generally made in very low quantity with hand-written labels. The soft acetate surface of these discs can be played no more than about 10 times before they start to wear out.\n\nAnother type of rare item which has occasionally been used as a promo is a \"test pressing\" or white label. These are the first disc copies pressed at the factory. They are used to check manufacturing quality before mass production begins.\n\niTunes and other markets distribute songs for a price on a pre-set schedule; such as one a week in a 'Countdown' to the parent album's release. These pre-sales of album tracks are often called 'promotional singles' by many.\n\nPromotional recordings are distributed to commercial AM and FM radio stations for airplay. These singles typically feature just the radio edit of the song, but may also include alternate remix edits, the original album version, or even call-out hooks\n\nWhen it comes to electronic dance music, 12-inch records and CDs still remain the more popular media by which promotional recordings may be distributed to DJs in the nightclub industry. These singles typically feature one or more extended remixes (sometimes dubbed a \"club mix\") of the title track that are not generally available to the public as well as the original extended version, which in many cases is itself club-friendly. In some cases, the disc may have anonymous track labeling or lack labels altogether. Often the corresponding CD may also carry radio edits and other alternate cuts that did not make it onto the 12-inch record itself, in which case the CD is referred to as a maxi-single CD. Promotional recordings may also include digital recordings in MP3, MP4, or Windows Media Audio formats to discourage illegal copying and enable effective recall when the promotional period has expired.\n\nIt is not unusual for a promo single to have no commercially available counterpart particularly in those genres that are predominantly oriented to nightclub applications.\n\nMany companies currently offer promotional compilations to DJs, radio use and nightclubs alike. The format is growing on the CD format, but some companies still offer promotional compilations in vinyl also. Most of the compilations are genre-specific (like most of CD Pools' compilations) but there are also compilations that offer a combination of different genres (like compilations from DMC and Music Factory). Such compilations are normally released monthly. In addition to companies that work internationally, there are also many companies that offer national promotions material in the form of compilations.\n\nVersions in the compilation are usually either radio edits or extended / 12\" remixes of the song, depending a bit on the targeted audience. Club scene music is usually in the longer and easier to play format of extended remix, whereas more street targeted music is usually released as radio edits. It normally takes a couple of weeks after the release of the original promo single to be available on promotional compilations. This has the added benefit of having the songs when they're already had some airtime and are thus not the bleeding edge no-one has heard from, but still have usually not been released to the mass markets yet.\n\nSome of the internationally established companies are CD Pool and DMC. Many fledgling companies are also available offering both well-known and lesser known releases.\n\nSince the advent of broad-bandwidth Internet access and professional tools such as iPool or Haulix, the online promotional distribution of music has been established. Record companies make their music available as audio files and use the Internet as a distribution channel. In contrast to the conventional way of distributing promotional recordings, this kind of promotional distribution is faster and cheaper.\n"}
{"id": "486596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=486596", "title": "Roy Acuff", "text": "Roy Acuff\n\nRoy Claxton Acuff (September 15, 1903 – November 23, 1992) was an American country music singer, fiddler, and promoter, freemason. Known as the \"King of Country Music,\" Acuff is often credited with moving the genre from its early string band and \"hoedown\" format to the singer-based format that helped make it internationally successful. In 1952, Hank Williams told Ralph Gleason, \"He's the biggest singer this music ever knew. You booked him and you didn't worry about crowds. For drawing power in the South, it was Roy Acuff, then God.\"\n\nAcuff began his music career in the 1930s and gained regional fame as the singer and fiddler for his group, the Smoky Mountain Boys. He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1938, and although his popularity as a musician waned in the late 1940s, he remained one of the Opry's key figures and promoters for nearly four decades. In 1942, Acuff and Fred Rose founded Acuff-Rose Music, the first major Nashville-based country music publishing company, which signed such artists as Hank Williams, Roy Orbison, and the Everly Brothers. In 1962, Acuff became the first living inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nAcuff was born on September 15, 1903 in Maynardville, Tennessee, to Ida (née Carr) and Simon E. Neill Acuff, the third of their five children. The Acuffs were a fairly prominent family in Union County. Roy's paternal grandfather, Coram Acuff, had been a Tennessee state senator, and his maternal grandfather was a local physician. Roy's father was an accomplished fiddler and a Baptist preacher, his mother was proficient on the piano, and during Roy's early years the Acuff house was a popular place for local gatherings. At such gatherings, Roy would often amuse people by balancing farm tools on his chin. He also learned to play the harmonica and jaw harp at an early age.\n\nIn 1919, the Acuff family relocated to Fountain City (now a suburb of Knoxville), a few miles south of Maynardville. Roy attended Central High School, where he sang in the school chapel's choir and performed in \"every play they had.\" His primary passion, however, was athletics. He was a three-sport standout at Central and, after graduating in 1925, was offered a scholarship to Carson-Newman University but turned it down. He played with several small baseball clubs around Knoxville, worked at odd jobs, and occasionally boxed.\n\nIn 1929, Acuff tried out for the Knoxville Smokies, a minor-league baseball team then affiliated with the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants). A series of collapses in spring training following a sunstroke, however, ended his baseball career. The effects left him ill for several years, and he suffered a nervous breakdown in 1930. \"I couldn't stand any sunshine at all,\" he later recalled. While recovering, Acuff began to hone his fiddle skills, often playing on the family's front porch after the sun went down. His father gave him several records of regionally renowned fiddlers, such as Fiddlin' John Carson and Gid Tanner, which were important influences on his early style.\n\nIn 1932, Dr. Hauer's medicine show, which toured the southern Appalachian region, hired Acuff as one of its entertainers. The purpose of the entertainers was to draw a large crowd to whom Hauer could sell medicines (of suspect quality) for various ailments. While on the medicine show circuit, Acuff met the legendary Appalachian banjoist Clarence Ashley, from whom he learned \"The House of the Rising Sun\" and \"Greenback Dollar\", both of which Acuff later recorded. As the medicine show lacked microphones, Acuff learned to sing loud enough to be heard above the din, a skill that would later help him stand out on early radio broadcasts.\n\nIn 1934, Acuff left the medicine show circuit and began playing at local shows with various musicians in the Knoxville area, where he had become a celebrity and fixture in local newspaper columns. That year, the guitarist Jess Easterday and the Hawaiian guitarist Clell Summey joined Acuff to form the Tennessee Crackerjacks, which performed regularly on the Knoxville radio stations WROL and WNOX (the band moved back and forth between stations as Acuff bickered with their managers about compensation). Within a year, the group had added the bassist Red Jones and changed its name to the Crazy Tennesseans after being introduced as such by a WROL announcer named Alan Stout. Fans often remarked to Acuff how \"clear\" his voice was coming through over the radio, important in an era when singers were often drowned out by string band cacophony. The popularity of Acuff's rendering of the song \"The Great Speckled Bird\" helped the group land a contract with ARC, for which they recorded several dozen tracks (including the band's best-known track, \"Wabash Cannonball\") in 1936. Needing to complete a 20-song commitment, the band recorded two ribald tunes—including \"When Lulu's Gone\"—but released them under a pseudonym, the Bang Boys. The group split from ARC in 1937 over a separate contract dispute.\n\nIn 1938, the Crazy Tennesseans moved to Nashville to audition for the Grand Ole Opry. Although their first audition went poorly, the band's second audition impressed Opry founder George D. Hay and producer Harry Stone, and they offered the group a contract later that year. On Hay and Stone's suggestion, Acuff changed the group's name to the Smoky Mountain Boys, referring to the mountains near where he and his bandmates grew up. Shortly after the band joined the Opry, Clell Summey left the group and was replaced by the dobro player Beecher (Pete) Kirby—best known by his stage name Bashful Brother Oswald—whom Acuff had met in a Knoxville bakery earlier that year. Acuff's powerful lead vocals and Kirby's dobro playing and high-pitched backing vocals gave the band its distinctive sound. By 1939, Jess Easterday had switched to bass to replace Red Jones, and Acuff had added the guitarist Lonnie \"Pap\" Wilson and the banjoist Rachel Veach to fill out the band's lineup. Within a year, Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys rivaled the long-time Opry banjoist Uncle Dave Macon as the troupe's most popular act.\nIn the same period, he was initiated to the Masonic Lodge of East Nashville No. 560.\n\nIn spring 1940, Acuff and his band traveled to Hollywood, where they appeared with Hay and Macon in the motion picture \"Grand Ole Opry\". Acuff appeared in several subsequent B-movies, including \"O, My Darling Clementine\" (1943), in which he played a singing sheriff; \"Night Train to Memphis\" (1946), the title of which comes from a song Acuff recorded in 1940; and \"Home in San Antone\" (1949), in which he starred with Lloyd Corrigan and William Frawley.\n\nAcuff and his band also joined Macon and other Opry acts at various tent shows held throughout the Southeast in the early 1940s. The crowds at these shows were so large that roads leading into the venues were jammed with traffic for miles. Starting in 1939, Acuff hosted the Opry's \"Prince Albert\" segment. He left the show in 1946 after a dispute with management.\n\nIn 1942, Acuff and songwriter Fred Rose (1897–1954) formed Acuff-Rose Music. Acuff originally sought the company in order to publish his own music, but soon realized there was a high demand from other country artists, many of whom had been exploited by larger publishing firms. Due in large part to Rose's ASCAP connections and gifted ability as a talent scout, Acuff-Rose quickly became the most important publishing company in country music. In 1946, the company signed Hank Williams, and in 1950 published their first major hit, Patti Page's rendition of \"Tennessee Waltz\".\nIn 1943, Acuff was initiated into the East Nashville Freemasonic Lodge in Tennessee, of which he would remain a lifelong member. Later that same year, Acuff invited Tennessee Governor Prentice Cooper to be the guest of honor at a gala held to mark the nationwide premiere of the Opry's \"Prince Albert\" show. Cooper rejected the offer, however, and lambasted Acuff and his \"disgraceful\" music for making Tennessee the \"hillbilly capital of the United States.\" A Nashville journalist reported the governor's comments to Acuff and suggested Acuff run for governor himself. While Acuff initially did not take the suggestion seriously, he did accept the Republican Party nomination for governor in 1948.\n\nAcuff's nomination caused great concern for E.H. Crump, the head of a Memphis Democratic Party political machine that had dominated Tennessee state politics for nearly a quarter-century. Crump was not worried so much about losing the governor's office—in spite of Acuff's name recognition—but did worry that Acuff would draw large crowds to Republican rallies and bolster other statewide candidates. While Acuff did relatively well and helped reinvigorate Tennessee's Republicans, his opponent, Gordon Browning, still won with 67 percent of the vote.\n\nAfter leaving the Opry, Acuff spent several years touring the Western United States, although demand for his appearances dwindled with the lack of national exposure and the rise of musicians such as Ernest Tubb and Eddy Arnold, who were more popular with younger audiences. He eventually returned to the Opry, although by the 1960s, his record sales had dropped off considerably. After nearly losing his life in an automobile accident outside of Sparta, Tennessee, in 1965, Acuff pondered retiring, making only token appearances on the Opry stage and similar shows, and occasionally performing duos with long-time bandmate Bashful Brother Oswald.\n\nIn 1972, Acuff's career received a brief resurgence in the folk revival movement after he appeared on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album, \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\". The appearance paved the way for one of the defining moments of Acuff's career, which came on the night of March 16, 1974, when the Opry officially moved from the Ryman Auditorium to the Grand Ole Opry House at Opryland. The first show at the new venue opened with a huge projection of a late-1930s image of Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys onto a large screen above the stage. A recording from one of the band's 1939 appearances was played over the sound system, with the iconic voice of George Hay introducing the band, followed by the band's performance of \"Wabash Cannonball\". That same night, Acuff showed President Richard Nixon, an honored guest at the event, how to yo-yo, and convinced the president to play several songs on the piano.\n\nIn the early 1980s, after the death of his wife, Mildred, Acuff, then in his 80s, moved into a small house on the Opryland grounds and continued performing daily on stage. He arrived early most days at the Opry before the shows and performed odd jobs, such as stocking soda in backstage refrigerators. In 1991, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, and given a lifetime achievement award by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the first Country music act to receive the esteemed honor. Roy Acuff died in Nashville on November 23, 1992 of congestive heart failure at the age of 89.\n\nMany of Acuff's songs show a strong religious influence, most notably \"Great Speckled Bird\", \"The Prodigal Son\" and \"Lord, Build Me a Cabin\". Such songs were typically set to a traditional Anglo-Celtic melody, which is most apparent on \"Great Speckled Bird\" and the 1940 recording \"The Precious Jewel\". Acuff performed popular songs of the day, including Pee Wee King's \"Tennessee Waltz\" and Dorsey Dixon's \"I Didn't Hear Nobody Pray\", the latter of which he appropriated and renamed \"Wreck on the Highway\". He also recorded a version of the Cajun fiddler Harry Choates's \"Jole Blon\". Traditional recordings included \"Greenback Dollar\", which he probably learned from Clarence Ashley while on the medicine show circuit, and \"Lonesome Old River Blues\", which he recorded with the Smoky Mountain Boys in the 1940s. Acuff and the Crazy Tennesseans recorded \"Wabash Cannonball\"—another traditional song—in 1936, although Acuff did not provide the vocals on this early recording. The better-known version of the song with Acuff providing the vocals was recorded in 1947.\n\nIn 1979, Opryland opened the Roy Acuff Theatre, which was dedicated in Acuff's honor (it was demolished in 2011 after suffering extensive damage in the 2010 Tennessee floods). Dunbar Cave State Natural Area was established in 1973 from a recreational area the state had purchased from Mrs. McKay King. The cave was owned by Acuff from 1948 to 1963. Two museums have been named in Acuff's honor—the Roy Acuff Museum at Opryland (now closed) and the Roy Acuff Union Museum and Library in his hometown of Maynardville. Acuff has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 1541 Vine Street. He is pictured with other country singers at the new Smoky Mountain Opera in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.\n\n"}

The story and script were both created by Deborah Dean Davis and Hannah Louise Shearer, and the episode was directed by Robert Becker.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\"-D. In this episode, the crew respond to a distress call from Dr. Paul Manheim (Rod Loomis). While the crew must deal with the results of Manheim's haywire experiments with time, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must deal with his former love Jenice (Michelle Phillips), who is also Manheim's wife.\n\nThe story of the episode was influenced by the film \"Casablanca\", and was affected by the timing of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. Because of the strike, the script was written in five days and it was only when it was filmed that it was discovered to be incomplete. Shearer was not happy with the result and felt that the on-screen chemistry of Stewart and Phillips was lacking. Reviews of the episode have been mixed, with one reviewer summing it up by saying \"there’s nothing I can point to at this episode and say is wrong, but it’s one of the more forgettable episodes.\"\n\nThe \"Enterprise\", along with other ships in the sector, experience a localized time-distortion, and soon after receive a distress-call from Dr. Paul Manheim in a nearby system. Captain Picard [Patrick Stewart] recalls that Manheim was ejected from the Federation Science Institute for conducting unauthorized experiments. They find the distress signal coming from a facility on a planetoid surrounded by a force-field. When they make contact with the facility, a woman requests help to save her husband, Dr. Manheim, and lowers the shields.\n\nThe two are brought aboard and while Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) tends to Dr. Manheim, who is having convulsions, Picard discovers his wife is Jenice, Picard's former love. Jenice warns that her husband was working privately in his laboratory, but that she didn't know what he was working on. She also alerts the crew to numerous security protocols that he has installed at the facilities. As the crew prepares to send an away-team to investigate the laboratory, they experience more time distortions, described by Data (Brent Spiner) as \"Manheim effects\". In one instance Picard, Riker and Data enter a turbolift only to see their past selves conversing outside of the lift. The crew find that they cannot complete a transporter beam to the facility due to the security measures in place there.\n\nDr. Manheim recovers long enough to explain that he was doing experiments involving time, gravity, and funnels to other universes, and suspects his last experiment is running out of control. Manheim explains that he is trapped between two dimensions and Data determines that the experiment must be shut down during a time fluctuation or else it will simply grow larger. Manheim provides the crew with the correct coordinates to beam down to avoid the security fields. Picard admits to Jenice that he worried about losing her again after he left her in Paris, and vows to correct Dr. Manheim's experiment.\n\nAs he is affected less by the distortions, Data is sent down alone and disables the remaining security measures before entering Manheim's laboratory. He finds a column of energy emanating from a dimensional matrix, the source of the time distortions. Data, though briefly affected by the time distortions, is able to add anti-matter to the matrix, causing the matrix to stabilize and halt the time distortions. Dr. Manheim fully recovers, and he and Jenice thank Picard and the crew for their help. Picard and Jenice use the holodeck to recreate one more encounter at a Paris café, before she returns with her husband to the planet.\n\n\"We'll Always Have Paris\" is named in reference to the Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman film \"Casablanca\". As well as the title of the episode and the love triangle in the story, the Blue Parrot Café from the film is directly mentioned by Captain Picard. \"Casablanca\" was also the basis for the earlier \"\" novel \"The Entropy Effect\", and would be so again in the \"\" episode \"\".\n\nThe story was originally pitched by Hannah Louise Shearer and Deborah Dean Davis, who were also given the job of developing the script. The writing of the episode suffered from the timing of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, with Shearer and Dean Davis completing the script in five days. The premise of the story was a combination of their idea of a story \"about a professor whose work wasn't appreciated and had to go off on his own\" and that of Maurice Hurley who wanted a story with a time anomaly. The final draft was dated 22 February and featured numerous differences from the filmed version, including Jenice being called Laura, a number of different interactions for the crew, and Riker, Worf and Data all being involved in shutting down Manheim's equipment. The script was finalised a week before the episode was filmed, but the writers strike caused further issues when it was discovered during filming that the scene where Data was to fix the time distortions hadn't been completed.\n\nRobert Legato and Rick Berman spent forty minutes on the telephone with Shearer during the strike. While she refused to write the lines during the strike, Berman suggested dialogue and Shearer would give opinions with Legato taking down handwritten notes. Legato decided on the directing notes himself, and used a whip pan shot instead of an effects shot to film the three Datas as director Robert Becker had never used effects shots previously. Shearer wasn't happy with the final result, saying \"we were writing the most romantic episode in the world\" but that \"it was toned down 75%\".\n\nShearer later complained of a lack of chemistry between Michelle Phillips and Patrick Stewart, which Phillips blamed on the conflicted nature of the character in that she was committed to her husband but also wanted to see Picard once more. Phillips, a \"Star Trek\" fan, is better known for being a member of the 1960s group The Mamas & the Papas. Rod Loomis's previous science fiction outing was in \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" as Sigmund Freud, and Lance Spellerberg would later return in \"The Icarus Factor\" where his transporter chief gained the name Ensign Herbert. The image of 24th century Paris was a matte painting which was re-used in \"\" where it was hung outside the office of the Federation president.\n\n\"We'll Always Have Paris\" aired in broadcast syndication during the week commencing May 5, 1988. It received Nielsen ratings of 9.7, reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot. This was the same ratings received as the previous episode, \"Skin of Evil\".\n\nSeveral reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode on behalf of TrekNation in September 2007, comparing certain elements of the episode to \"Casablanca\" and the series finale \"\". These included the ending where time distortions caused Data to be replicated three times in \"We'll Always Have Paris\" compared to the similar situation with three Picards in \"All Good Things...\". Overall she thought that the episode was better than she recalled previously. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website \"Jammer's Reviews\" described the episode as too simple, especially the ending which he said was \"they give Data a canister, which he sticks into a hall of mirrors; problem solved\".\n\nZack Handlen, reviewing the episode for \"The A.V. Club\" in May 2010, said that he enjoyed the \"time blips\" in the episode, but that he wasn't a fan of the romance between Jenice and Picard. He also felt that there wasn't much follow up on Manheim's experiments and that he seemed to be left to cause a more serious accident in the future. Keith DeCandido watched the episode for Tor.com in July 2011. He thought that Michele Phillips was \"incredibly radiant\", and said, \"there’s nothing I can point to at this episode and say is wrong, but it’s one of the more forgettable episodes\", giving it a score of four out of ten.\n\nThe first home media release of \"We'll Always Have Paris\" was on VHS cassette was on July 1, 1992 in the United States and Canada. The episode was later included on the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" season one DVD box set, released in March 2002, and was released as part of the season one Blu-ray set on July 24, 2012.\n\n\n"}

In 1962 a bowling alley and restaurant was built west of the Empire Pool. The Stadium Bowl boasted 24 bowling lanes.\n\nThe name Starlight for the restaurant was probably inspired by the Starlight Dance held in the neighbouring Empire Pool on 17 October 1959, which was one of the very first popular music events held at Wembley.\n\nTenpin bowling competitions were held at the Stadium Bowl, some reported on Pathé newsreels. One of these was the London International Matchplay tournament, which ran at Wembley from 1962 to 1972, before moving to the Airport Bowl in 1973. In 1966 the cup for the Coca-Cola Bottlers International Masters Championship was presented to winner John Wilcox of the USA by England football captain Bobby Moore, whose team had just won the World Cup. \n\nThe general manager in the early 1970s was called Ralph Miller.\n\nThe tenpin bowling craze declined relatively quickly and had largely died out by 1972. The Stadium Bowl became a 15-court squash centre in November 1974, hosting the British Open Squash Championships from 1975 to 1980. It has since been demolished.\n"}

The WFMT's mission is to promote global awareness of both the scientific and artistic nature of the profession, while also contributing to its development. The Federation advocates for the recognition of music therapy as an evidence-based profession through its support of educational programs, clinical practice, and research. WFMT is divided into eight global regions representing different parts of the world: Africa, Australia/New Zealand, North America, Latin America, Southeast Asia, Europe, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific. Detailed listings of countries within each region can be found in the federation's bylaws, posted on its website.\n\nIn 2010, the WFMT celebrated its 25th anniversary. The seeds for the development of the World Federation of Music Therapy were sown during the second World Congress of Music Therapy in Buenos Aires in 1976. A group of American, European, and South American music therapists met and started to develop a plan for unity and standards in the international arena of music therapy. Among the ten founding members were Rolando Benenzon (Argentina), Giovanna Mutti (Italy), Jacques Jost (France), Barbara Hesser (USA), Amelia Oldfield (UK), Ruth Bright (Australia), Heinrich Otto Moll (Germany), Rafael Colon (Puerto Rico), Clementina Nastari (Brazil), and Tadeusz Natanson (Poland). The Federation was formally established during the 5th World Congress of Music Therapy in Genoa, Italy, in 1985. Anecdotal reports about the beginnings of WFMT as well as the founder’s motivation can be found at the online journal, \"Voices.\"\n\nWFMT leadership consists of 20 individuals serving in a volunteer capacity as officers, commissioners, or regional liaisons. The officers are the President, Past President, Secretary/Treasurer, and the Executive Assistant. The commissioners oversee committees related to one of eight areas: education & training, clinical practice, global crises intervention, publications, research & ethics, accreditation & certification, public relations, and world congress organization. Regional liaisons, a new position as of 2008, reside in the WFMT global regions they represent and collect and disseminate information related to developments in the profession. The Assembly of Student Delegates, started in 2011, consists of student leaders representing each of WFMT's global regions and is facilitated by the Executive Assistant.\n\nThe WFMT Council uses online sources such as the WFMT website, blog, podcasts, videos, social media, emails and an annual report to communicate with its members and others associated with music therapy. The WFMT Council also holds symposia, panels, and roundtables at major international conferences to inform others about global music therapy developments and the most recent projects in WFMT.\n\nThe World Congress of Music Therapy is held every three years in a different country. Music therapy professionals and experts in related fields from around the world gather at the congress to share ideas, experiences, trends, and research outcomes. The World Congress of Music Therapy is hosted by a WFMT organizational member in conjunction with a local host.\n\nPrevious congress locations include:\n\n1. Paris, France (1974)\n\n2. Buenos Aires, Argentina (1976)\n\n3. San Juan, Puerto Rico (1981)\n\n4. Paris, France (1983)\n\n5. Genoa, Italy (1985) - Founding of the World Federation of Music Therapy (WFMT)\n\n6. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (1990)\n\n7. Vitoria, Spain (1993)\n\n8. Hamburg, Germany (1996)\n\n9. Washington, D.C., USA (1999)\n\n10. Oxford, England (2002)\n\n11. Brisbane, Australia (2005)\n\n12. Buenos Aires, Argentina (2008)\n\n13. Seoul, South Korea (2011)\n\n14. Vienna and Krems, Austria (2014)\n\n15. Tsukuba, Japan (2017)\n\n"}
