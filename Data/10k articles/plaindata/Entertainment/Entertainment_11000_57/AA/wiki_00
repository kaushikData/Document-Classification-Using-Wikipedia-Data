{"id": "5247146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5247146", "title": "Adult Film Association of America", "text": "Adult Film Association of America\n\nThe Adult Film Association of America (AFAA) was the first American association of pornographic film producers. It fought against censorship laws, attempted to defend the industry against prosecution for obscenity, and held an annual adult film awards ceremony. Founded in 1969, it continued separate operation until 1992 when it merged with Free Speech Legal Defense Fund. The organization was also host to the Erotic Film Awards which were held from 1977 until 1986.\n\nIt was founded in 1969 in Kansas City, with Sam Chernoff of Astro-Jemco Film Co. as the first president. Other notable presidents included film producer David F. Friedman, elected the third president in 1971, and re-elected four times before becoming Chairman of the Board, and erotic actress and magazine publisher Gloria Leonard, who became president in 1986.\n\nIt held adult film awards ceremonies for 10 years during the Golden Age of Porn. The first awards ceremony was held July 14, 1977, at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles while religious protesters picketed outside, as they would several years thereafter. \"These feverish protesters are such a familiar part of the ritual, they really should be listed in the program,\" sex news magazine \"Cheri\" stated after the 1983 awards.\n\nWith the advent of pornography on video, in early 1986 the AFAA renamed itself Adult Film and Video Association of America (AFVAA) and added a new award category, best adult video. The 10th annual awards, held at the Sheraton Premiere Hotel in Los Angeles on June 29, 1986, were the last.\n\nThe association changed its name again in 1987 to the Adult Video Association (AVA). No awards were given for 1987. Instead, in mid-1988 they were replaced by an annual Night of the Stars dinner-dance and legal fundraiser, the fifth of which it held in June 1992 with more than 500 people in attendance, the association's biggest show ever. Lifetime Achievement Awards were presented at the Night of the Stars, however, film awards were discontinued.\n\nBy February 1992, the tables were turned – association members \"picketed the Public Forum on Pornography sponsored by religious groups who hope to institute morality codes back into all movies made.\"\n\nIn October 1992, Video Vixens Trading Cards for collectors were released with part of the profits going to the AVA. That same month, the AVA and Free Speech Legal Defense Fund, which had been organized in 1991, unified to create a new umbrella organization, the Free Speech Coalition (FSC). Its role as the trade association of the adult entertainment industry was taken over by the FSC, which acknowledges the AFAA as its first ancestor.\n\nPornographic actress Marilyn Chambers presented the very first award for best erotic motion picture to the L. Sultana production of \"The Opening of Misty Beethoven\", while runner-up was \"Count the Ways\", produced by Virginia Ann Perry. Jennifer Welles and Jamie Gillis were the first winners in the best actress and best actor categories. Pornographic actor John Holmes told the crowd at the first year's awards, \"In the not-too-far distant future we will proudly say that we were pioneers.\"\n\nRetroactive awards of merit were also given to five movies considered best from 1955 to 1975: \"Tonight for Sure\", \"Not Tonight, Henry!\" \"Trader Hornee\" and \"Sometime Sweet Susan\". \"Deep Throat\" was also honored as one of the top-grossing of all movies, including mainstream films, of 1972. Board chairman Friedman said the AFAA was \"much too busy fighting legal battles\" in the early days to hold awards ceremonies, so these special awards were intended to make up for not having presented them in the past.\n\nFor a time the most notable erotic film awards were those of the AFAA, considered to be \"the closest thing the porn world's got to filmdom's Oscar derby.\" Many stars would arrive in chauffeur-driven limousines while some would vie for attention by arriving in a four-horse carriage, a Roman chariot, a horse or even an elephant. The third annual awards \"drew a festive crowd of some 600 porn-people plus several hundred hard-core fans to the Hollywood Palladium.\" Subsequent awards shows even attracted celebrities such as \"The Godfather\" director Francis Ford Coppola, singer Stephen Bishop and gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson to be part of the audience and comedian Jackie Gayle and singer Jaye P. Morgan of \"The Gong Show\" to be part of evening's entertainment. The fifth and eighth awards ceremonies were videotaped and offered to cable and subscription television and for sale on VHS cassettes while the seventh was taped for an August 1983 broadcast on Playboy TV. Other awards during the porno chic era included \"Adam Film World's\" X-Caliber awards, first given out in 1975 and based on votes of fans, \"Hustler\" magazine's Erotic Movie Awards, first presented in 1977 and the Critics Adult Film Awards, bestowed by a New York-based group of East Coast adult sex film critics from 1981 to 1987.\n\nBy the third awards ceremony in 1980, although the concept was seen as positive, adult entertainment magazine \"Genesis\" reported they were \"beginning to generate as much controversy as the regular Academy Awards, or more.\" While it seemed \"politicking\" gave the Best Film award to \"Legend of Lady Blue\" over heavy favorites \"Sex World\" and \"Take Off\", the \"most glaring lack of any validity\" was shown by giving the best actor award to Aldo Ray. \"The Erotica Awards are supposed to be presented to sex-film performers who both 'act' well and 'perform' well. In \"Sweet Savage\", not only did Aldo Ray not 'act' particularly well—his part was simply gratuitous...he never even performed at all. The fact is he never even took his clothes off, nor did he show up to receive his award.\" Aside from that, \"Sweet Savage\" was released \"well into 1979\" and the films nominated were supposed to have been released in 1978, leaving the impression the AFAA gave him the award to \"capitalize on his name and to obtain more media coverage.\" \"Adam Film World Guide\", however, reported the following year's awards, which were presented in July 1981, \"covered films released from mid-1980 to the middle of '81\", which could have meant \"Sweet Savage\" was eligible for awards in 1979 if the same time frame was considered. Meanwhile, \"Adam Film World\" noted Ray's award \"was not surprising considering that one of the announced functions of the aFAA and its annual awards is to upgrade the image of the adult film industry in the public eye.\"\n\nOriginally the Erotica Awards were determined by vote of the \"association's membership of more than 700 producers, distributors and theater operators.\" However, in later years the AFAA ceremony was increasingly accused of bias, with a \"belief among some that the West Coast producers were controlling what films received the awards\" after \"Amanda By Night\" was passed over for best film at the 1981 awards. Starting with the awards presented in 1982, the AFAA decided to appoint an independent jury of three persons not associated with the adult film industry to make the final choices from the five finalists in each category. Jurors subsequently included an assortment of men and women such as a sexologist, author Robert Rimmer and journalists such as Brendan Gill of \"The New Yorker\" and other publications including \"Daily Variety\", \"Playboy\", \"USA Today\" and the \"Los Angeles Herald Examiner\".\n\nHowever, criticism continued, especially for the best erotic scene victory of \"Virginia\" in 1984, which led to the founding of the X-Rated Critics Organization and its Heart-On Awards. The role of adult film awards has been mostly supplanted by the AVN Awards, which also launched in 1984.\n\nThe AFAA had a credo that \"recognized the responsibilities of adult filmmakers to the general public\":\n1. That films of adult subject matter will be produced for and exhibited to adult audiences and that persons not of legal age will not be admitted.\n2. That the definition of an \"adult\" is that designation set by the constituted authorities of the community but in no event any persons under the age of 18 years.\n3. That we will produce and exhibit only films that are in conformity with the Free Speech Provisions of the Constitution of the United States of America.\n4. That we will respect the privacy of the general public in our advertising and public displays.\n5. That we in \"no manner\" will condone, produce or exhibit child pornography in any form.\n\nThe AFAA awards were called the Erotic Film Awards and the trophy, known as the Erotica Award, was a golden statuette \"in the form of a shapely nude holding high a rampant spear in an obvious attitude of erotic excitement.\" Winners are shown below in the year the awards were presented:\n\nAfter the Erotic Film Awards were discontinued, the association resumed presenting Lifetime Achievement Awards at its annual \"Night of the Stars\" fundraising event, starting in mid-1988. When the association merged into the Free Speech Coalition in late 1992, the new coalition took over the tradition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"Adam Film World\" recorded the winner of this category in 1979 as having been a tie between Roger Caine and John Seeman. \"Cinema-X\" magazine recorded Roger Caine as the sole winner.\n\n"}

{"id": "35251434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35251434", "title": "Analogue: A Hate Story", "text": "Analogue: A Hate Story\n\nAnalogue: A Hate Story (Korean: ) is a visual novel created by independent designer and visual novelist Christine Love. It was created with the Ren'Py engine, and was first released for download on the author's website in February 2012. A sequel set centuries after Love's earlier work, \"\" (2010), \"Analogue\" revolves around an unnamed investigator, who is tasked with discovering the reason for an interstellar ship's disappearance once it reappears after 600 years. The game's themes focus similarly around human/computer interaction, interpersonal relationships, and LGBT issues; but focus primarily on \"transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness and cosplay.\"\n\n\"Analogue\" has a word count of about 59,000.\n\n\"Analogue: A Hate Story\" is a visual novel featuring semi-static manga-style character images, and focused on reading text logs. Using the mouse and keyboard, the player interacts with the \"Mugunghwa\"s main computer to read log entries, communicate with the AIs, and occasionally enter commands directly into the vessel's computer system. At any time in the game, the player can save their game, adjust options, etc.\n\nThe main user interface allows the player to read through various diaries and letters that reveal the game's backstory and insight into its many (deceased) characters. For the most part, navigating this interface is similar to navigating a basic e-mail system, in that messages are chronologically arranged and searchable. They are grouped in usually numbered \"blocks\", released to the player by *Hyun-ae or *Mute throughout the game. For the most part, the AIs release blocks \"out of order\", or do not release all entries in a block, forcing the player to assemble the timeline of events out of what clues they have, and draw certain conclusions independently until (or if) the AIs can be convinced to be more forthcoming. In most cases, the player can, after reading a log entry, show its content to the currently active AI. This is the primary process by which additional information and message blocks are revealed. Players can also type in an entry's alphanumeric ID in the main log menu to obtain it directly, as long as its corresponding block is decrypted.\n\nCommunication with *Hyun-ae and *Mute is limited to choosing responses to yes-no questions. In the game, *Hyun-ae explains that the ship's disrepair may have led to the language parsing systems to malfunction, forcing her to put the interface together from scratch. Though *Hyun-ae and *Mute almost never communicate directly, the player can act as a go-between, taking a list of direct questions from *Mute to *Hyun-ae. This is a major turning point in the game, as the player not only receives answers to the questions, but has occasional opportunities to voice a third opinion on the events that led to the \"Mugunghwa's\" current state. The player can also access the \"Mugunghwa's\" override terminal, which can be used to decrypt data log blocks, switch between AI, change costumes for *Hyun-ae, adjust the behavior of some ship systems (a key aspect for the meltdown sequence), and more. The override terminal works like a basic text parser system similar to Unix shell commands, accepting only a very limited vocabulary of instructions that must be typed directly and correctly.\n\nDue to the branching nature of the story, the game must be played more than once to unlock all logs to complete the game, as it is impossible to reveal all log entries and information from the AIs in one playthrough. A log system separate from the game's save files displays all discovered logs from all playthroughs, effectively tracking the player's overall completion.\n\nSet several thousand years in the future, \"Analogue\" revolves around the \"Mugunghwa\" (), a generation ship that lost contact with Earth some 600 years prior to the events of the game. For reasons initially unclear, society aboard the ship had degraded from that of modern, 21st Century South Korea, to the intensely patriarchal culture of the medieval Joseon Dynasty. In the process, the ship's clocks were reset to year 1, and the colonists began using Hanja characters to read and write. The reasons for why such a cultural shift has occurred is lost to time, leaving the player to formulate the cause on their own. Over the three centuries after the shift, the ship's birth rates began to gradually decline, to below the \"replacement rate\" of noble families. By year 322, the ship inexplicably went dark, falling into a state of severe disrepair.\n\nIn \"Analogue\"s present, 622 years later, the \"Mugunghwa\" is discovered in orbit above Antares B, a star system \"en route\" to its destination. A friend of the protagonist's, a dispatch officer, is the one who discovers the ship on their radar; this catches the attention of the Saeju Colony Historical Society (which suggests that humans have established planetary colonies beyond Earth), who sponsors the recovery of any remaining text logs that can explain the ship's disappearance. The dispatch officer gives the unnamed silent protagonist, an independent investigator, this \"job\" in the introduction message for its isolation from social situations; this implies that the protagonist is somewhat asocial, but beyond this their personality and background is based almost entirely upon the player's decisions. The protagonist encounters two AI cores within the ship's computer. The first, *Hyun-ae (), is a bright, cheerful girl who loves cosplay, and is highly curious about the player and the future they come from. The other, *Mute, is the ship's security AI and self-proclaimed \"social creature\", who outranked all but Emperor Ryu, her master and Captain of the ship. The AIs dislike one another intensely, apparently due to the event that led to the ship's demise. The logs the player must recover are written by members of the Imperial Ryu family, the noble Kim and Smith families, and those linked to them. The game relies heavily on this unreliable narrator mechanic, where the AI characters and log entries thematically withhold key information from the player in order to add to the importance of certain elements of the plot (e.g. the administrator password to the ship's computer).\n\nIn \"Analogue\"s introductory cutscene, the protagonist receives a message from a colleague, who tasks them with accessing the text logs aboard the \"Mugunghwa\", and download as many as possible, as sponsored by the Saeju Colony Historical Society. After enabling the system AI using a Linux-style terminal, *Hyun-ae greets the player, pleasantly shocked to find an external connection. She expresses her gratitude to the player for contacting the ship \"after so many years\", and promises that she will do her utmost to help access the logs.\n\nAs the player reads the logs, *Hyun-ae provides commentary on the letters and diaries of the late inhabitants of the \"Mugunghwa\". A key series of logs discovered with *Hyun-ae is the diary of the Pale Bride, a sick girl on the ship who was placed in stasis so her compromised immune system could be cured by future medical technology not available during her lifetime. The Pale Bride was brought out of stasis many years later by the descendants of her immediate family, the Kim family, in order to serve as a fertile young bride to Emperor Ryu In-ho, captain of the \"Mugunghwa\". She found herself in a culturally reverted, deeply misogynistic society, writing that \"[e]veryone's so uneducated and stupid\". The Pale Bride, accustomed to the more liberal society of her own time, has difficulty assimilating with this reverted culture, and often describes youthful rebellions in her diary entries.\n\nAfter giving the player a key entry from the Pale Bride's diary, *Hyun-ae reveals that she is the AI form of the Pale Bride, and asks the player to decrypt a block of restricted data by entering the override terminal in super-user mode (accessible only by entering a certain password). While attempting to do so, the player encounters a corrupted AI core and is forced to restore it to proceed. This activates *Mute, who reveals that *Hyun-ae may be linked to the ship's demise by referring to her as \"that murderous bitch\". As only one of the AIs can be active at a time (determined by keying in Linux-like terminal commands), the path through the story and the revelations contained within the many logs and messages branch based on decisions made by the player - most relevantly, which AI receives the most attention.\n\nUpon reaching one of two criteria (obtaining a certain percentage of the games logs, or showing *Hyun-ae any one of *Mute's questions), the game's main climax occurs—the \"Mugunghwa\"s nuclear fission reactor enters meltdown, endangering the AI cores, valuable data, and the protagonist. The player must execute a series of commands to safely shutdown the reactor and vent out residual heat, all within 20 minutes. The player must choose which AIs they will continue the story with prior to meltdown; leaving their separate cores on consumes too much power for the backup power system, and it is not possible to activate the dormant AI from this point onwards. Once the player has safely disabled the reactor, saving the life of the active AI, the game will continue similarly to before, with the player accessing logs and the surviving AI providing commentary. Each AI reveals a different side of the Mugunghwa's story: *Hyun-ae will assist in uncovering the Pale Bride's perspective, while *Mute yields logs from the noble families of the ship. More interaction will take place between the player and the AI, until a pivot is reached with the relationship and one of the five endings will occur.\n\nEventually, it is revealed that the Pale Bride (now *Hyun-ae) was brutally treated by the Kim family after they awoke her from stasis. After many small rebellions and increasingly serious punishments, going so far as to refusing to be wed to Emperor Ryu, to whom she had been promised as a bride and concubine, her adoptive parents cut out her tongue to prevent the young girl from speaking out against men (a trauma *Mute was unaware of to the game's present). After her marriage, Hyun-ae became close friends with the Emperor's first wife, Empress Ryu Jae-hwa. She calls her \"stronger than I ever was\", not letting men order her around \"while still knowing her place\"; as well as the only person to notice Hyun-ae's muteness and failing health. Upon the Empress's sudden death, Hyun-ae's sorrow and rage ultimately drove her to kill everyone she hated aboard the \"Mugunghwa\" by deactivating its life support systems. As the crew suffocated to death, she retreated into the computer system as an AI by using a \"neurosynaptic\" scan of her brain and a copy of *Mute's AI coding, which she used to deactivate the security AI up until \"Analogue\"s present. This explains the *Hyun-ae's hatred of the Kims, *Mute's hatred of *Hyun-ae, and acts as a key factor for the player's decisions.\n\nThe first two endings involve *Hyun-ae leaving the Mugunghwa with the protagonist, either as a companion or lover. In the third ending, the protagonist leaves without taking either AI with them (either by not saving the ship from meltdown in time, or by prematurely downloading the logs before the end of the AI commentary has been reached). This conclusion can also be reached if the player opts not to download the AI data during the final conclusion. The fourth ending involves \"kidnapping\" *Mute, effectively relieving her of her duties on the ship. The fifth ending, which can only be accessed by \"cheating\" (searching manually for a log which would not normally appear on the story branch in question), involves taking \"both\" AIs as a harem. The game can also end by penalty for disagreeing too much with an AI, causing the angered AI to permanently disconnect the protagonist from the ship's computer, or by the \"bad priorities\" ending, which occurs when the player downloads the logs \"during\" the meltdown sequence, which takes too much time, killing them in the explosion.\n\nWhen looking for a setting to place \"Analogue\", Christine Love settled on Korea's Joseon Dynasty, saying that it had \"always fascinated me the most for a number of reasons, not all of them negative.\" Among those reasons was how women were dehumanizingly treated then compared to the Goryeo Dynasty. \"The plot is moved mostly by the Pale Bride, the modern girl who can't understand what's going on…but the crux of it, really, was trying to get into the heads of everyone else[:] the men and women who have internalized all these awful misogynist ideals and take them completely for granted as the way things are. So the story really just formed itself around that question: what would it be like to be a woman in that society? History didn't care about the answer, but I do. The rest—the modern-thinking woman who can't possibly survive [*Hyun-ae], the women who are forced to navigate family politics, the men who are complicit in this whole system but can't just be dismissed as bad people [Smith]—all came naturally in that attempt to answer it.\"\n\nLove had mixed feelings about the AI characters during development. For instance, *Hyun-ae, as the Pale Bride, underwent almost no change from being a girl of modern times who couldn't understand the society she was thrust into. *Mute, apart from her position as the ship's security AI, was an unknown with, as Love stated, \"how she'd end up turning out.\" As *Mute's \"cheerful misogyny\" began to define itself through her dialog, however, Love \"started to hate her, especially with every line I wrote… Then she started to grow on me[. I]t was never really her fault she was like that[;] it was just her way of surviving, I realized.\" Neither character gave her much surprise, but Love \"definitely never anticipated feeling so much sympathy for *Mute.\"\n\nIn an informal Kotaku interview, Love revealed that she considered being drunk while writing a \"necessity\", due to the Joseon dynasty's reprehensible history and the nature of the research of social agendas against women. Despite her disgust at the philosophies behind \"Analogue's\" misogyny, Love expressed her interest in how \"ideas take root...Nobody ever just wakes up one day and says[,] 'yeah, I hate women, I wish we'd stop letting them read.'\"\n\nOn April 13, 2012, Dischan Media announced that it would distribute \"Analogue: A Hate Story\", along with Juniper's Knot, through its online store.\n\nAn update for the game containing a Japanese localization was released on December 4, 2014. The game is also being localized by volunteers into Spanish and German.\n\n\"Analogue\"'s soundtrack was composed by Isaac Schankler. It contains eighteen tracks, with three of them included as bonus tracks.\n\n\"Analogue\" was highly praised on both plot and interface, with the former being more noted than the latter. Eurogamer and JayIsGames praised the dark and emotional themes, pointing to how the mechanics interact with the thematic plot.\n\nSeveral bloggers and gaming media sites noted the mechanics and interface of the game as well as the plot, such as 2chan.us and Killscreen, with 2chan labelling it as a \"literary and intellectual delight.\" Matthew Sakey of Tap-Repeatedly remarked that \"the thing about Christine Love is that she is a really, really good writer, one capable of astonishing deftness in her work.\"\n\n\"PC Gamer UK\" gave \"Analogue\" 76 out of a 100, noting in particular to the skilfulness of the author's structural talent. Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun said the brightness of the art was contradictory to the gloomy themes. As of August 26, 2013, \"Analogue\" holds a Metascore of 62 on Metacritic.\n\nChristine Love announced that a sequel to \"Analogue\" titled \"Hate Plus\". Originally planned to be DLC before becoming full sequel release on 19 August 2013. According to an article by Kotaku's Patricia Hernandez, the sequel takes place after the events aboard the Mugunghwa and will feature the player returning to Earth and discovering how society on board the ship broke down. Those that finished the original game are able to import their save games into the sequel so that any decisions made will be part of the new story. Following Endings 1, 2, 4, and/or 5, \"Hate Plus\" reveals the events that took place aboard the \"Mugunghwa\", prior to the shift into the Joseon-like society depicted in the original \"Analogue\".\n\n"}

It is the third game in the \"Army of Two\" series, following 2008's \"Army of Two\" and 2010's \"\". The game takes place in Mexico and pits T.W.O. against a drug cartel known as La Guadaña (Spanish for \"the Scythe\"). It is the first game in the series to run on the Frostbite 2 game engine, whereas the previous two ran on Unreal Engine 3. The demo for the game was released on March 13, 2013. It was the second to last game developed by Visceral Montreal.\n\nThe game received mediocre reviews; criticism was drawn towards the game's removal of the co-op interactions, being only able to play as Alpha, and the game's story. \"The Devil's Cartel\" was also a commercial failure for Electronic Arts.\n\nWhere as the last two games focused around characters, Salem and Rios, \"Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel\" focuses around two new T.W.O. operatives named Alpha and Bravo. It is speculated that the reasoning behind the unidentified names is to give the player the feeling that it is them fighting through the missions.\n\nReturning from the first game is the Overkill mode, which makes both players invincible for a short period of time. However, features such as back to back, playing rock, paper and scissors with your partner, and other co-op interactions have been removed in favor of a more fast-paced gameplay. Competitive multiplayer from the second game does not return to focus on a richer co-op experience.\n\nIt has been noted that the game features more customization options compared to the previous games in the series. \"The Devil's Cartel\" features a mask creator which allows players to completely customize their masks, thus giving their TWO operative its own persona. Customers can pre-order the \"Overkill Edition\" which comes with bonus weapons, masks, outfits, and missions that are not available with the standard version of the game.\n\nShortly after being recruited into T.W.O. (Tactical Worldwide Operations), Alpha and Bravo join T.W.O. and complete a training session. T.W.O. founders Tyson Rios and Elliot Salem give them their masks and bring the two new recruits on a rescue operation to save multiple hostages in a cartel compound. During the operation, Estaban Bautista and his henchman leave as Rios, Salem, Alpha, and Bravo raid the compound. Only one hostage is found alive, a girl named Fiona. Salem attempts to persuade the group to leave, not wanting to risk their lives to save Fiona who is not part of their misson objective.Rios insist that she's innocent and that he wont leave her behind, Alpha and Bravo agree, Salem then decides to go alone and leave. During Salem's escape, a thug destroys Salem's vehicle, leaving Rios, Alpha, and Bravo attempting to rescue him, but Rios injures his right leg in the process. Alpha and Bravo save the girl from cartel forces and evacuate with Rios, lamenting the loss of Salem.\n\nFive years later, T.W.O. is hired by Mayor Cordova, a Mexican politician seeking to bring down La Guadaña and kill its leader, Bautista. The T.W.O. operatives believe nothing will go wrong until the convoy's movement is interrupted by La Guadaña's forces. Alpha and Bravo survive constant waves as Cordova escapes. Alpha and Bravo push their way to the Cartel's forces to City Hall for extraction. T.W.O. operative Mason drives them out of the city but is killed when the Cartel ambush them on the road at a gas station. Alpha and Bravo meet Mason's contact, Fiona who aids the team in bringing down La Guadaña and killing Bautista. Fiona gives Alpha and Bravo intelligence that Cordova fled to a local church that is serving as a La Guadaña compound.\n\nAlpha and Bravo fight through a hotel resort to encounter El Diablo, La Guadaña's top Lieutenant, learning that El Diablo killed a large number of T.W.O. operatives and captured Cordova. El Diablo sets charges off in the hotel resort, blowing it in half to make his escape leaving Alpha, Bravo & Fiona trapped inside. Alpha, Bravo and Fiona survive El Diablo's counterattack, and the trio go the Church, listening in on Bautista's interrogation with Cordova. El Diablo alerts them as the duo fight their way to Fiona. Surviving a train disaster, Alpha, Bravo and Fiona temporarily rescue Cordova while surviving T.W.O. operatives die protecting the mayor. Alpha, Bravo and Cordova navigate through a mexican ghetto & are captured after trying to rescue T.W.O. operative Bradley, but to no avail.\n\nAlpha, Bravo and Cordova are tortured by the cartel in a room. El Diablo reveals his true identity as Salem, who survived the explosion and was forced to face the Cartel by himself. Surviving, he joined forces with Bautista and feels betrayed by Rios and the duo for not \"checking\" to see if he was alive. Salem kills Cordova for calling him a \"monster\" and leaves. Alpha and Bravo escape and regroup with T.W.O. operatives Anthony \"Baker\" Barnes and Charles \"Chuy\" Rendall, requesting for extraction. Rios is among to hear of Salem's betrayal and orders him to be kept alive and brought to him.\n\nFiona tells the team that Salem and Bautista are hiding at a hacienda. Alpha, Bravo, Baker, and Chuy lead a T.W.O. strike force with assistance from Mexican Special Forces to raid the hacienda. During the raid, Bautista kills Chuy and Baker. Fiona pursues him, but is captured and relocated to a quarry. Alpha and Bravo are extracted by Rios via helicopter to rescue Fiona.\n\nThe trio crash as Alpha and Bravo save Rios, who tells them to get Fiona as he will catch up. Alpha and Bravo successfully regroup with Fiona, who kills Bautista for taking her. However, Salem reveals that killing him was part of his plan and holds Fiona at gunpoint. Salem tells of the times he risked his life for Rios (especially to \"save Hong Kong\" and took a bullet for Rios, implied of ), and kills Fiona. Rios charges at Salem, Salem shoots Rios in the abdomen and flips him off of a two-story balcony before escaping.\n\nAlpha and Bravo regroup with Rios, who orders them to kill Salem, changing his mind on saving him. Alpha and Bravo corner Salem, who attacks them with an armored vehicle. Destroying the vehicle, Bravo is given the command to kill Salem, but instead allow the Mexican Special Forces take him into custody. Rios, Alpha, and Bravo think ahead of what to do next. They promise to oversee Fiona's burial, carry out an extended vacation, and then sign on for the next mission. Meanwhile, Salem etches the name Alice on his prison cell wall. In the post-credits epilogue, Salem is seen smiling when an armored guard and an unidentified visitor approach him.\n\nEA announced that purchasers who pre-order the game could play with characters based upon B.o.B and Big Boi. The hip hop artists have collaborated on the game's theme song \"Double or Nothing\", produced by SoFLY and Nius and Oddfellow, and appear in game as T.W.O. operatives Charles 'Chuy' Rendall (Big Boi) and Anthony 'Baker' Barnes (B.o.B), sent to take down the cartels in Mexico.\n\n\"Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel\" received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 56.25% and 58/100 and the Xbox 360 version 54.24% and 54/100.\n\nThe game was heavily criticized for the removal of the co-op interactions, being only able to play as the Alpha character, and the game's story.\n\nDaniel Krupa of IGN gave the game a 5 out of 10, criticizing the enemy AI as moronic, insipid environments, cover mechanics being frustrating, the gameplay being monotonous, but praised the ally AI for being reliable. In the Verdict, Krupa said: \"Devil's Cartel feels like a hollowed-out version of previous Army of Two games. The distinctive edges have been sanded down, creating something that's not just generic but unrelated to what went before. The humour has been drained and long-time fans might feel aggrieved by the decision to sideline Salem and Rios in favor of these lame characters. If you absolutely must experience the mediocrity first hand, Army of Two: Devil's Cartel is still probably best played with a friend... but friends don't let friends play tedious mediocre games.\"\n\nRichard Grisham of GamesRadar found \"The Devil's Cartel\" to be fun and awarded it four in a half stars. Grisham stated at the end of his review; \"Army of Two: Devil's Cartel seems to accomplish exactly what it set out to do, offering an intense, impressive two-player co-op experience that's heavily customizable and replayable. While it won't likely scratch the itch of those looking for a more traditional shooter game--namely, competitive online multiplayer--it's an original concept set inside familiar trappings.\"\n\nOn more negative side, Kevin VanOrd gave the game 5 out of 10, criticizing all of the series' best aspects being removed or toned down, the gunplay being forgettable, forgettable story and characters, the cooperation between players being very little, and problems with the AI but praised the some fun set pieces, the more open levels give you room to maneuver, and cover system encourages fluid movement. VanOrd said in verdict; \"Previous Army of Two games stood apart in their own ways, not always excelling, but still willing to hew their own paths. Engaging the opposition in a Shanghai zoo, escaping across a collapsed skyscraper, saving civilians from menacing threats--these are small but meaningful moments that might be etched on your psyche from the series' past. There's nothing here to make a mark: no creativity on display, no clever competitive modes, no sense of accomplishment. There's only a seven-hour campaign, optional missions in which you try to keep the overkill meter consistently replenished, and the knowledge that in a month, you won't remember having played Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel\".\n\nDan Whitehead of Eurogamer.net scored the game with a 5 out of 10. Whitehead said at the end of his review of the game; \"\"The Devil's Cartel\" is functional and fuss-free, a game that delivers the expected genre tropes with as little imagination and as much bluster as possible. It's not a bad game, but nor does it have anything beyond basic mechanical competence to mark it out as \"good\" - and even that competence wobbles more than it should. In a few years' time, I'll probably look back over my Xbox Live profile and be surprised to see that not only did they make a third \"Army of Two\" game, but that I apparently played and completed it.\"\n\nResponding to the negative response, Visceral Games executive producer Julian Beak said that \"\"The Devil's Cartel\" suffered \"low morale\"\".\n\n\"Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel\" was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in North America on March 26, 2013. The game later launched in Japan and Europe on March 28, and 29, respectively. \"The Devil's Cartel\" was not successful as EA's previous month releases, due to the game being released the same month as \"Tomb Raider\" and \"BioShock Infinite\". The game sold over 260,000 copies worldwide.\n\n"}

{"id": "34903115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34903115", "title": "Autism spectrum disorders in the media", "text": "Autism spectrum disorders in the media\n\nAutism spectrum disorders (\"ASD\"s) or autism spectrum conditions (\"ASC\"s) describe a range of conditions classified as neurodevelopmental disorders in the DSM-5, used by the American Psychiatric Association. As with many neurodivergent people and conditions, the popular image of autistic people and autism itself is often based on inaccurate media representations.\n\nSince the 1970s, fictional portrayals of people with autism, Asperger syndrome, and other ASCs have become more frequent. Public perception of autism is often based on these fictional portrayals in novels, biographies, movies, and TV series. These depictions of autism in media today are often made in a way that brings pity to the public and their concern of the topic, because their viewpoint is never actually shown, leaving the public without knowledge of autism and its diagnosis. Portrayals in the media of characters with atypical abilities (for example, the ability to multiply large numbers without a calculator) may be misinterpreted by viewers as accurate portrayals of all autistic people and of autism itself.\n\nSince the 1970s, characters have appeared in film, television, and print that could be qualified as \"on the [autism] spectrum.\" Characters have been presented as being described as openly autistic in canon, or have been designed with one of many ASCs in mind.\n\n\n\nThe MMR vaccine was the subject of controversy resulting from publication of a (now retracted) 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield \"et al.\" In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been \"dishonest\"; the research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by the \"BMJ\".\n\nA March 2007 article in \"BMC Public Health\" postulated that media reports on Wakefield's study had \"created the misleading impression that the evidence for the link with autism was as substantial as the evidence against\". Earlier papers in \"Communication in Medicine\" and \"British Medical Journal\" concluded that media reports provided a misleading picture of the level of support for Wakefield's theory.\n\n\"PRWeek\" noted that after Wakefield was removed from the general medical register for misconduct in May 2010, 62% of respondents to a poll regarding the MMR controversy stated they did not feel that the media conducted responsible reporting on health issues.\n\nA \"New England Journal of Medicine\" article examining the history of antivaccinationists said that opposition to vaccines has existed since the 19th century, but \"now the antivaccinationists' media of choice are typically television and the Internet, including its social media outlets, which are used to sway public opinion and distract attention from scientific evidence\".\n\nThe role of the media in the sensationalization of the MMR vaccination issue was discussed by the \"BMJ\":The original paper has received so much media attention, with such potential to damage public health, that it is hard to find a parallel in the history of medical science. Many other medical frauds have been exposed, but usually more quickly after publication and on less important health issues.\n\nConcerns were also raised about the role of journalists reporting on scientific theories that they \"are hardly in a position to question and comprehend. Neil Cameron, a historian who specializes in the history of science, writing for \"The Montreal Gazette\" labeled the controversy a \"failure of journalism\" that resulted in unnecessary deaths, saying that 1) \"The Lancet\" should not have published a study based on \"statistically meaningless results\" from only 12 cases; 2) the anti-vaccination crusade was continued by the satirical \"Private Eye\" magazine; and 3) a grapevine of worried parents and \"nincompoop\" celebrities fueled the widespread fears. The \"Gazette\" also reported thatThere is no guarantee that debunking the original study is going to sway all parents. Medical experts are going to have to work hard to try to undo the damage inflicted by what is apparently a rogue medical researcher whose work was inadequately vetted by a top-ranked international journal.\n\nMedia speculation of historical figures on the autism spectrum is based on reported behavior and anecdotal evidence rather than any clinical observation of the individual. Fred Volkmar of the Yale Child Study Center has remarked that \"there is unfortunately a sort of cottage industry of finding that everyone has Asperger's\". Professor Michael Fitzgerald's research, which portrays many historical figures are autistic, has been heavily criticised, and described by some as \"fudged pseudoscience\" and \"frankly absurd\".\n\nAdditionally, media speculation of contemporary figures as being on the autism spectrum has become popular in recent times. \"New York\" magazine reported some examples, which included that \"Time\" magazine suggested that Bill Gates is autistic, and that a biographer of Warren Buffett wrote that his prodigious memory and \"fascination with numbers\" give him \"a vaguely autistic aura.\" The magazine also reported that on \"Celebrity Rehab\", Dr. Drew Pinsky deemed basketball player Dennis Rodman a candidate for an Asperger's diagnosis, and the UCLA specialist consulted \"seemed to concur\". Nora Ephron criticized these conclusions, writing that popular speculative diagnoses suggest autism is \"an epidemic, or else a wildly over-diagnosed thing that there used to be other words for.\" Thomas Sowell has criticized \"Time\" diagnosis of Bill Gates, saying that the people diagnosing him have not seen him personally. Paul Steinberg has also criticized the literary portrayals of Warren Buffett and Tim Page as autistic, writing these men are able to compensate more completely than a truly autistic child or adult whose language deficiencies and cognitive deficits can often put him at a level of functioning in the mentally retarded range.\n"}

{"id": "24054290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24054290", "title": "Batoo", "text": "Batoo\n\nBatoo is a Korean variant of the board game Go. The name stems from a combination of the Korean words \"baduk\" (“Go”) and \"juntoo\" (“battle”). It is played entirely in cyberspace, and differs from Go in a number of ways, most noticeably in the way in which certain areas of the board are worth different point values. The other principal difference is that both players place three stones before the game begins, and may also place a special “hidden stone”, which affects the board as a regular stone but is invisible to the opponent. It was launched in November 2008.\n\nBatoo is usually played on an 11x11 board, although some games may take place on boards as large as 13x13. Boards in Batoo usually have plus-point and minus-point spots. When a player plays on these spots, they will either gain or lose five points. Different \"maps\" will have different plus-point locations and minus-point locations. Before the game begins, both players place a \"base build\", consisting of three marked stones. When players are making their base-builds, they cannot see their opponent's base build. If there is any overlap, a minus-point will replace the pair of stones. Base stones are worth 5 points each, as opposed to a normal stone which is worth only 1.\n\nThe player who starts is the one who makes the highest bid of points to their opponent for the privilege. This process is also known as \"turn-betting\". Once the base-building and the turn-betting end, both players have 25-second intervals to make each move. For every stone on the board, a player will gain 1 point. If a player takes more than 25 seconds to make their move, they lose 2 points (unless a 'special ability' character is used) and a new 25-second interval begins. If more than 3 25-second intervals are taken by any player during the game, that player loses the game. The territory each player has at the end of the game is then added to the score.\n\nThe most unusual aspect about Batoo is the Hidden Stone. Once per game, every player may play a Hidden Stone instead of a normal stone. The Hidden Stone is not revealed to the opponent until they play a move where the Hidden Stone is located or until they locate it with a scan. A player may play a \"scan\" for 2 points, where they click a spot on the board and discover whether or not the Hidden Stone is on it. The player may make a normal or hidden stone move following the scan.\n\nA player can select one of three characters that grant the player special abilities. A fourth character can be bought using the in-game currency. The players can also buy different color substitutes for black stones [dark red, dark green, dark violet, dark blue] and can also buy different-looking boards with different themes with the in-game currency.\n\nPlayer ability in Batoo is determined by \"levels\". Learners start at level 5, and can progress up to level 35.\n\n"}

It is a fruit of the enlightenment and the emergence of the bourgeois class and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.\n\nThere are a few examples of tragic plays with middle-class protagonists from 17th century England (see domestic tragedy), but only in the 18th century did the general attitude change. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play: George Lillo's \"The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell\", which was first performed in 1731. In France, the first \"tragédie bourgeoise\" was \"Sylvie\" by Paul Landois, which came out in 1741. Years later came two plays by Denis Diderot: \"Le fils naturel\" was first staged in 1757 and \"Le père de famille\" in the following year; while these plays were not strictly tragedies, they treat bourgeois lives in a serious manner atypical of contemporary comedy and provided models for more genuinely tragic works.\n\nWhile ordinary people had always been the subject of comedies, classical and neo-classical theorists asserted that tragic heroes should always be men of noble rank. Aristotle articulates this idea in \"ars poetica\" (\"The Poetics\") and it figures prominently in later ancient writings on drama and poetics. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century critics, including the influential German Martin Opitz, perpetuated the theory that only members of the higher classes were capable of suffering harm serious enough to deserve dramatic reenactment. This rule was followed throughout Europe for centuries: usually, princes and members of the nobility, such as Andreas Gryphius' Carolus Stuardus (i.e. King Charles I of England), Jean Racine's Phèdre (the wife of Theseus, a mythical king of Athens) or William Shakespeare's King Lear, serve as tragic protagonists.\n\nIn Germany, where the new genre was called \"Bürgerliches Trauerspiel\", it was especially successful. Usually, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's play \"Miss Sara Sampson\", which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest \"Bürgerliches Trauerspiel\" in Germany. However, Christian Leberecht Martini's drama \"Rhynsolt und Sapphira\" is slightly older. Lessing's \"Emilia Galotti\" of 1771 is a classic example of the German Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. Lessing also offered a thorough theoretic justification for his disregard of the old rules in his \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie\". Other important examples of German Bürgerliche Trauerspiele are \"Die Soldaten\" by Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (1776) and Friedrich Schiller's \"Kabale und Liebe\" (1784). \n\nBourgeois tragedies tend to propagate the values of the bourgeois class to which their heroes belong. Their ideal is the virtuous citizen, who is excluded from state affairs and whose intentions are focused on his private life and the life of his family. Values like virtue, humanity, individuality and true feelings are cherished in bourgeois tragedies.\n"}

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the regulatory authority; in most of Europe, standards are set by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\n\nBroadcast safe standards for 625 lines of Standard Definition (Inaccurately referred to as PAL, a colour encoding that is usually used with such systems) video are:\n\nBroadcast safe standards for 525 lines of Standard Definition (System M, NTSC) video are:\n\nDigital broadcasting is very different from analog. The NTSC and PAL standards describe both transmission of the signal and how the electrical signal is converted into an image. In digital, there is a separation between the subject of how data is to be transmitted from tower to TV, and the subject of what content that data might contain. While data transmission is likely to be a fixed and consistent affair, the content could vary from High Definition video one hour, to SD multicasting the next, and even to non-video datacasting. In the US, 8VSB transmits the data, while MPEG-2 encodes pictures and sound.\n\nBroadcast engineers in North America usually line up their audio gear to nominal reference level of 0 dB on a VU meter aligned to +4dBu or -20dBFs, in Europe equating to roughly +4 dBm or -18 dBFS. Peak signal levels must not exceed the nominal level by more than +10 dB.\n\nBroadcast audio as a rule must be as free as possible of Gaussian noise, that is to say, it must be as close to the noise floor, as is reasonably possible, considering the storage or transmission medium.\n\nBroadcast audio must have a good signal-to-noise ratio, where speech or music is a bare minimum of 16db above the noise of the recording or transmission system. For audio that has a much poorer signal-to-noise ratio (like cockpit voice recorders), sonic enhancement is recommended.\n\nAlthough almost any video gear can create problems when broadcast, equipment aimed at consumers sometimes produces video signals which are not broadcast safe. Usually this is to reduce the cost of the gear, since a non-standard video signal in the home might not create the problems that one might find in a broadcast facility.\nPotential flaws exist with:\n\n\nIn nations that have fully converted to digital television, broadcast safe analogue television takes on a slightly different meaning. All broadcasting systems will have been mostly converted to digital only outputs, leaving fewer entry points for analogue television signals.\n\nWhat this means is that all devices that feed to the television transmitter must take in and feed standard analogue television signals into the transmission chain. Mostly it is up to the switcher to notify if there is non-broadcast safe video to the programmer. However, due to the limitations of many switchers for DTV and HDTV it ultimately is up to the automation systems to alert the programmer of non-broadcast safe video inputs.\n\nAs a matter of broadcast engineering practice, 4:3 analogue television signals will always pose the most problems with broadcast safe compliance. The use of portable and cheap timebase-genlock systems for analogue television inputs in the digital television studio will be clearly mandatory for the next 50 years.\n\n"}

The Media Research Center, a right-wing media watchdog group led by L. Brent Bozell, has been especially critical about what it has perceived to be unduly favorable coverage of liberal topics by CBS, especially during the tenure of \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Dan Rather.\n\nIn his 2001 book \"\", former CBS correspondent Bernard Goldberg extensively criticized Rather's management of CBS News and what he claimed was Rather's combative efforts to skew the network's coverage.\n\nIn 1964, Rep. Jimmy Utt (R-Cal.) filed a libel suit against CBS regarding a CBS Reports \"Case History of a Rumor\" program. He claimed the defendants had \"'entrapped' him into giving a television interview that turned out to be a 'cross examination' by Roger Mudd, who acted as 'prosecutor, judge, and jury.'\" The case was dismissed. Utt died in office in 1970 and was succeeded by John G. Schmitz.\n\nOn February 15, 1966, CBS News president Fred Friendly resigned in protest after the network declined to show hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the expanding Vietnam War in favor of reruns of I Love Lucy. The decision, made by the network's vice president of broadcasting, John M. Schneider, specifically related to the testimony of George F. Kennan not being shown, in contrast to NBC News, which was showing it live.\n\nIn 1971, the FCC and the House Commerce Committee issued reports claiming that CBS News financially subsidized Project Nassau, a planned 1966 invasion of Haiti intended to overthrow then-dictator François Duvalier; CBS News allegedly became involved in the plot in order to shoot the invasion for a television documentary. However, the participants in the invasion were arrested by the FBI before it could be carried out. In a deposition, \"Atlanta Journal\" reporter Tom Dunkin claimed that Jay McMullen, a CBS producer, told him that he had \"spent a lot of time and money on this project and had nothing to show for it.\" CBS was denounced by Vice President Spiro Agnew, who accused the network of disseminating \"self-serving propaganda.\"\n\nOn September 8, 2004, two months before the 2004 presidential election, \"60 Minutes II\" broadcast a report by Dan Rather claiming that a series of memos had surfaced criticizing President George W. Bush's service record in the Texas Air National Guard, purportedly discovered in the personnel files of Bush's then-commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. However, independent analysis of the documents in question -- particularly analysis of their anachronistic typographic conventions -- strongly suggested that they were actually forgeries.\n\nDespite initially defending the authenticity of the documents, Rather and CBS eventually admitted that they were misled about how they were obtained; Rather, however, has continued to insist that the documents weren't conclusively proved to be forged. After an internal investigation, CBS dismissed four producers and allegedly hastened Rather's retirement as anchor of the \"CBS Evening News\". Rather filed a $70 million lawsuit against CBS in 2007, claiming that the network and its management had made him a \"scapegoat\" in the Killian story. In 2009, Rather's lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nOn the April 4, 2007, broadcast of the \"CBS Evening News\", Katie Couric gave a one-minute commentary about the importance of reading. However, it was later discovered that Couric's commentary was substantially lifted from a column by Jeffrey Zaslow in \"The Wall Street Journal\". Despite the personal flavor of the piece -- with Couric saying how she still remembered receiving her first library card -- it was later determined that a producer had written the commentary instead of Couric, and that she had plagiarized from Zaslow's column. CBS quickly fired the producer and promised changes to its procedures.\n\nSteve Kroft, Co-Editor of \"60 Minutes\", interviewed Barack Obama immediately following the noted Rose Garden press conference held in response to the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi where Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed. CBS withheld significant parts of the interview that confirm the President's refusal to acknowledge the attack as a confirmed act of terror despite the prominence that arose following the second presidential debate. CBS quietly released the footage just two days before the 2012 election.\n\nOn 10 March 2014, reporter Sharyl Attkisson resigned from CBS News, citing what she saw as the network's liberal bias, an outsized influence by the network's corporate partners, and a lack of dedication to investigative reporting. In her upcoming book, Attkisson also reports about how her computer was hacked, deleting stories about the Benghazi attack.\n\nIn January 2017, after the events of the 2017 Chicago torture incident took place, CBS Radio News reported, \"The viral video of a beating and knife attack in Chicago suggests the assault had racial overtones. CBS’s Dean Reynolds tells us the victim is described as a mentally challenged teenager. In the video he is choked and repeatedly called the n-word. His clothes are slashed and he is terrorized with a knife. His alleged captors repeatedly reference Donald Trump.\" This description was criticized by conservatives, including Jack Armstrong and Joe Getty at the San Francisco CBS Radio News affiliate KGO (AM).\n\n"}

The authors use many examples to show the simultaneous interplay between competition and cooperation. Their research added to previous industry analysis such as Michael Porter’s five forces model, which focused almost entirely on competition between businesses.\n\n—Review by Strategy+Business\n\n\n"}

The gag name pokes fun at the perceived propensity of some lawyers and accountants to take advantage of their clients: The name of the firm is a pun on the phrase \"Do we cheat 'em? And how!\" This gag name is also used more broadly as a placeholder for any hypothetical law firm.\n\nThe second name varies somewhat with regards to spelling (Cheetem, Cheater, Cheethem, Cheatham, etc.), but also to the word upon which it is based (Screwum, Burnham, etc.).\n\nTom and Ray Magliozzi, of NPR's \"Car Talk\" radio program, named their business corporation \"Dewey, Cheetham & Howe\". Their corporate offices were located on a third-floor office at the corner of Brattle and JFK Streets in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Magliozzi brothers declared that they established DC&H in 1989.\n\nA popular poster for \"The Three Stooges\" features the Stooges as bumbling members of such a firm, although the actual episodes use the name \"Dewey, Burnham, and Howe\". The 2012 film uses this example, among similar ones such as proctologists \"Proba, Keister, and Wince\" and divorce lawyers \"Ditcher, Quick, and Hyde.\" In the film \"Heavenly Daze\", Moe and Larry deal with a crooked attorney named \"I. Fleecem\" (I fleece 'em).\n\nThe champion Standardbred race horse Deweycheatumnhowe takes his name from this pun. On August 3, 2008, that undefeated horse won harness racing's most prestigious event, the Hambletonian Stakes, run at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nVariants exist on the theme. The British magazine \"Private Eye\" uses \"Sue, Grabbitt, and Runne\" (\"sue, grab it and run\") when satirizing the legal profession, reflecting the magazine's experience defending from defamation lawsuits. In a set of legal forms published for lawyers and other legal professionals, one fictitious law-firm name is \"Skrewer, Widow & Children.\" The narrating presidential aide in Christopher Buckley's novel \"The White House Mess\" came from the law firm of \"Dewey, Scruem, and Howe\".\n\nRobin Williams used a variant of the pun when making a joke about the Bernard Madoff fiasco and the fact that his name is pronounced as \"made off\" by saying \"What's next, a law firm called Dewey, Fuckyou and Howe?\"\n\nThe novel \"Gump and Co.\", Winston Groom's sequel to \"Forrest Gump\", names \"Dewey, Screwum, & Howe\" as legal representation for members, including Forrest Gump, of a New York firm accused of insider trading.\n\nIn an episode of \"Gilmore Girls\", Luke Danes (Scott Patterson), while dealing with his wife's irritating divorce lawyer, jokes that his own lawyer is Don Dewey at \"Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe.\"\n\nIn an episode of \"Prison Break\", Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell states that he won a large sum of money after sustaining an injury on an oil rig, thanks to his lawyers at \"Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe\".\n\nIn an episode of \"Friends\", Chandler Bing's boss states that the company they both work for has signed a contract with a new law firm: \"Dewey, Cheatem and Howe\". It is, of course, in the context of an office party, shortly before the boss is heard giving the punchline \"Twenty dollars Sister, same as in town.\".\n\nThe 1989 video game \"\" features a law firm by this name, though only the second partner, Suzi Cheatem, makes an actual appearance in the game.\n\nThe novel \"The Plague Dogs\" by Richard Adams features a firm of architects by the name of \"Sir Conham Goode, Son, and Howe\".\n\nIn an episode of \"White Collar\" (Season 01 Episode 09, time index 0:05:41) the document that has the Judge's ID stamp lists the Plaintiff as being represented by \"Donald Dewey of the law firm Dewey, Chetham and Howe\".\n\nIn the video game, \"The Sims 4\", Sims in the Business career go to work at the \"Dewey, Cheatem & Howe\" offices.\n\nIn one Stunt Dawgs comic book story, the Stunt Scabs' lawyer introduces himself as Slyme Whiplash and the law firm he works for as \"Dewey, Cheatam and Howe\".\n\n"}

In August 2009 he committed suicide while incarcerated, having been criminally charged with conspiring violence against prominent media figures in Israel.\n\nDavid Goldenberg, later Dudu Topaz, was born in Haifa, in then British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel) to Lilly and Eliyahu Goldenberg. His father was a radio announcer, actor and director. After his army service, Topaz studied acting in London. Upon his return, he performed with the Haifa Theatre and appeared in entertainment shows around the country. Topaz was married three times and had three sons.\n\nIn the 1970s, he took part in an Israeli radio show called \"לצון נופל על לצון\" (loosely:\"A pranker falls for a prank\"). His first job in television was as an English teacher in the Israeli Educational Television. In the early eighties Topaz began to direct television game shows in Channel 1. The most successful of those was the game show \"Play It\" (שחק אותה). Topaz was a television host in the Israeli public TV Channel 1 in the eighties and early nineties, as well as running some successful sketch comedy shows on stage. \n\nIn the nineties he was the host of popular show \"Rashut Habidur\" (The Entertainment Authority), later renamed \"Ha'Rishon Ba'Bidur\" (The First at entertainment), that aired for 11 seasons between 1994-2004 on Channel 2 commercial channel, and is one of the highest rated shows ever aired on commercial TV in Israel. After the show ended, Topaz hosted several other shows on other channels, but in May 2007 he announced that he would no longer host TV shows, but would pursue other careers such as acting and documentary film making.\n\nIn 1981, Topaz gained notoriety from comments he made during an Israeli Labor Party political rally in Tel Aviv's Malchei Yisrael Square (later renamed Rabin Square) when he said: \"It's a pleasure to see the crowd here, and it's a pleasure to see that there are no \"chahchahim\" (derogatory slang word alluding to Israeli Jews of Middle Eastern background) who ruin election gatherings. The Likud's \"chachchahim\" are at \"Metzudat Ze'ev\".\" (Likud party headquarters)\n\nIn May 2009, Topaz was arrested on suspicion of ordering, organizing and paying for a series of attacks on top-level TV executives Avi Nir and Shira Margalit and showbiz agent Boaz Ben-Zion. The three were beaten by assailants and sustained serious injuries. Topaz was also accused of planning attacks against television figures Zvika Hadar, Erez Tal, and Avri Gilad, Israel Hayom editor-in-chief Amos Regev, his ex-wife Roni Chen, and her husband Haim Zenati, as well as a second assault against Ben-Zion after judging that the first had not been severe enough. Topaz allegedly went on this revenge spree because his show was taken off the air, and because he was rejected by rival channels and newspapers for which he offered to write guest columns. On June 2, 2009, it was reported that Topaz had confessed to having ordered the assaults. Topaz was later also indicted for drug possession, due to allegations that for the previous three years, Topaz had purchased cocaine from Ofir Sasportas, one of the other suspects in the case.\n\nHe attempted suicide in his prison cell at the Abu Kabir Detention Center in Tel Aviv on July 3, 2009, after taking an overdose of insulin, used to control his diabetes. He was briefly hospitalized. \n\nA second suicide attempt on August 20, 2009 was successful, and at approximately 7:00 AM Topaz was found by a warden hanging in a shower (the only place without video surveillance) in the Nitzan Detention Center in Ramla. He apparently used the cord of an electric kettle to hang himself. He was buried in the Yarkon Cemetery in a funeral that hundreds of people attended.\n\nIn 2012 several men who Topaz hired to carry out the assaults were convicted or reached plea bargains.\n\n"}

It was formed by a group of White Russian exiles who had been forced to flee following the 1917 Russian Revolution and subsequent Russian Civil War. Initially the firm's personnel consisted mainly of Russian exiles, but over time French actors and directors were employed by the company. Its operations continued until the late 1930s.\n\nFaced with increasingly difficult working conditions in Russia after the revolution of 1917, the film producer Joseph Ermolieff decided to move his operations to Paris where he had connections with the Pathé company. Arriving in 1920 with a group of close associates, Ermolieff took over a studio in Montreuil-sous-Bois in the eastern suburbs of Paris and began making films through his company Ermolieff-Cinéma. His co-founder of the company was Alexandre Kamenka, another Russian exile, and when in 1922 Ermolieff moved to Germany, Kamenka, together with his colleagues Noë Bloch and Maurice Hache, took over the company and re-established it as the Société des Films Albatros. He also set up a distribution company called Les Films Armor in order to control the distribution of his own films. Various explanations have been given for the choice of the name Albatros: the name of a boat which brought some of the émigrés from Russia; a symbol of White Russia; an incident with an albatros on the journey. As well as adopting the image of the albatros as its symbol, the company took the motto \"Debout dans la tempête\" (\"upright in the storm\").\n\nAmong the group of Russian artists who stayed to work with Albatros were the directors Victor Tourjansky and Alexandre Volkoff, the art director Alexandre Lochakoff, the costume designer Boris Bilinsky, and the actors Ivan Mosjoukine, Nathalie Lissenko, Nicolas Koline, and Nicolas Rimsky. Although this Russian company initially favoured Russian themes, Kamenka quickly realised the need for greater integration with French film production, and they turned increasingly to French subjects. In 1924 a number of Kamenka's Russian associates left Albatros, and Kamenka offered opportunities to several innovative French film-makers including Jean Epstein, Jacques Feyder, Marcel L'Herbier and René Clair.\n\nKamenka's production policy combined prestige projects with openly commercial films, and his consistent record made him the most successful French producer during the 1920s, according to Charles Spaak, who came to the company as a script-writer in 1928. Kamenka successfully achieved international distribution for many of his films (even in Soviet Russia with which his company had so little political sympathy) and from 1927 he entered into co-production arrangements with production companies in other European countries, driven by growing financial difficulties in the French film industry. The arrival of sound pictures posed a serious difficulty for Albatros which had hitherto relied considerably upon Russian actors, especially Mosjoukine whose accent precluded a successful transition into the talking era.\n\nThe company's output diminished in the 1930s, but it achieved one further artistic success of note when Jean Renoir joined them for his 1936 adaptation of Gorki's \"Les Bas-fonds\". By this time, Albatros was the longest surviving film company operating in France, but with the outbreak of World War II, Kamenka wound up the company which had remained particularly associated with silent cinema.\n\n\n"}

Veit claims that he wants to travel to San Francisco because of the Golden Gate Bridge which is \"The westernmost point in the world.\" Tom is also fascinated by the idea and goes there with his friend.\n\nBecause the money they have saved is not quite enough they both book a flight to New York. Arriving there with only 55 dollars, a few clothes and some self-made films, Tom learns the real reason for Veit's desire to travel to San Francisco: Veit's goal above all else is to see his father again, who 12 years ago fled from the GDR and whose only sign of life is an annual birthday postcard. Veit wants to wait in front of the post office in San Francisco on his birthday - to meet his father when he sends the annual birthday card to him. They decide to travel further by hitch-hiking, because the remaining money would only buy them a train ticket to New Jersey.\n\nA comic book graphic artist named Daryll takes them both in his AMC Pacer in the direction of San Francisco. Daryll brings them both to a bar where they can show their film in the hopes of earning a little money. They meet two young girls who invite them to their house. Because the parents come back earlier than expected, Tom and Veit have to leave the house in a hurry and spend the night in the wilderness.\n\nThe next morning they get a free breakfast in a diner. Then Veit brings one of the customers - a biker - the wallet which he had forgotten on the table. The gang of bikers takes the two to the West. However, during a rest a fight starts between Veit and a drunk biker. Tom is injured in the teeth as he tries to get between them. Another biker Hope loans Veit and Tom his brother's car, under the condition that they deliver it to Hope's brother near San Francisco. The biker also tells them that he has no key for the trunk. Despite the suspicions of the two that they could be carrying drugs or weapons, they accept the offer. Actually, there are pieces of \"Star Wars\" merchandise in the trunk. The boys only discover this when they were stopped by the police who forcibly open the trunk.\n\nIn Silver City, New Mexico, they got to know Zoey, who speaks German thanks to her German mother and at whose place they spend two nights. In the local cinema, they show a documentary about the DDR and are subsequently invited to meet the Mayor. In the town they sell painted pieces of concrete as supposedly authentic pieces of the Berlin Wall so that they can pay for necessary repairs to the car. At last the trio drives in the direction of San Francisco. At a stopover in Las Vegas, Veit and Tom go to a gay club in Russian army clothes to strip in order to earn money for Tom's necessary dental treatment. While Veit waits in the hotel room for the other two, Tom spends the night with Zoey. This angers Veit, since he is in love with her too, and he drives off alone. Tom has a bad conscience and finally leaves Zoey, and it is unclear if the two will see each other again.\n\nTom and Veit meet again in front of the San Francisco post office and reconcile. While Veit has gone to get them a pizza, Tom believes he recognizes Veit's father, who is walking to the post office with a postcard in his hand. As a result, Tom speaks to him. After an initial hesitation, the stranger explains that he is not Veit's father, who was shot on the wall as he tried to escape. This man had at that time put his own application for a departure, which was granted by the Stasi on the condition that in the place of the dead victim (Veit's father) on the Berlin Wall, he should send letters and cards to the victim's relatives in order to make them believe that the escape attempt did not end in death.\n\nBefore Veit returns with the pizza, the stranger has gone, leaving Tom with the postcard. Tom tells Veit that his father is dead and Veit runs off aimlessly through San Francisco. Tom follows him to the Golden Gate Bridge where they embrace each other. The film ends with them delivering the car to Hope's brother.\n\nThe movie is based on a real-life journey of the producer Tom Zickler, who started out with friends after the fall of the Wall in order to travel to San Francisco. They also could only fly to New York because of money and needed to hitchhike the rest of the way. He hardly spoke any English and needed to work in a strip club to earn money.\n\n\"Friendship!\" was produced by Wiedemann & Berg Film Production in cooperation with Brown Entertainment and SevenPictures. The film was the first movie project distributed by the German Columbia Pictures/German Sony Pictures Film Production.\n\nThe parents of Tom's character are played by the actual parents of Matthias Schweighöfer. The sketches of the graphic artist who brought Tom and Veit in the car are redolent of the cartoon characters \"Ren and Stimpy\". The character is also reminiscent in appearance and manner of the Canadian artist John Kricfalusi.\n\n\"The Encyclopedia of International Films\" describes the comedy as \"good humored, well crafted, carefully designed buddy movie, to which stands the skillful and sophisticated production in blatant disparity to the cliche-ridden and simplicity of the content. Kino.de summarizes, \"it is seldom that someone in the wild west so explosively breaks in as these two easterners have.\" [...] \"Friendship!\" is the first feature film project by Markus Goller. It is beneficial to him that he lives in the U.S. and learned his work as a commercial director. Because rarely before has a German director put so well into picture the endless American hinterland.\"\n\nCritic.de writes; \"From the beginning, the mystery of Veit's past makes a tragic undertone. The real purpose of his journey is his father, who fled from the DDR years ago and now lives in San Francisco. The only sign of life since then was an annual birthday postcard to his son, Veit wants to catch him and so the trip soon becomes a race against time. [...] We finally find out how he actually did it and with this begins \"Friendship!\" Then however timidly on explicit political terrain - how successful this is, is argumentative, but with the opinionated gesture of coming from the same home \"The Lives of Others\" (2006) the film has little in common.\"\n\nJohannes von der Gathen, author of dpa, described the film as \"entertaining, but arg silly comedy that lead straight and without subtleties of socialist rain in the neo-capitalist eaves.\" \"It can be the [...] Director [...] of a cliché about the clash of cultures. If the producers Max Wiedemann and Quirin Berg, a few years ago with the Oscar-winning \"The Lives of Others\" managed a sensation, you could celebrate similar success with this half-hearted humor and casserole might be greatly doubted. But the screenplay by Oliver Ziegenbalg lurches too listless of Gag to Gag, in between there are then some criticism of capitalism before the movie quite openly bathing in nostalgia again \"MovieMaze however, wrote: \"Though the crew shoots in some places significantly over target also, but everything is possible in all an entertaining road movie with a good dose of slapstick.\"\n\nkonfenster.de voted the film to be Film of the Month in January 2010 and recommended it as an educationally valuable film, suited for classroom discussion. The film offers easy entertaining access to the historical and political background of GDR time and reunited Germany. From the contrast between two countries with different systems, director Markus Goller creates all kinds of comical sparks.\" \n\"Friendship!\" premièred on 11 January 2010 in the Cinemaxx on the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. The official German premiere was on 14 January of that year. In Germany, the production was watched by 336,777 viewers by the end of the first weekend it was displayed and with a 908 people average audience in 371 cinemas was placed right after the James Camerons' \"Avatar\" (2009) on the second place of the cinema charts.\n\nIn total the comedy stayed in the top 20 in the charts for seven weeks and recorded about 10.3 million Euro in the box office until May 2013, with 1,597,200 viewers. In the official ranking of the most seen cinema movies of the year 2010, the production took the 14th place.

Broderick Greer, Episcopal Curate specializing in conversations at the intersection of social media, queer theology, black theology, American history, racial justice, and human rights; Justin Lee, the founder and executive director of GCN; and Tracey Lind, recipient of the Human Rights Campaign Equality Award, who has been named Woman of Achievement by the YWCA Greater Cleveland, and has been honored through the National Council of Church's Circle of Names program.\n\nIn the United States, the Gay Christian Network, like most churches, is an Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that provides resources and support to its members. Like church membership, people participate in the Gay Christian Network ministry without financial cost. Members and supporters can choose to offer financial support for administration and programming through one-time and/or recurring free-will donations. Financial support is also provided by planned giving opportunities.\n\nMembers of The Gay Christian Network have a diverse set of theological beliefs from very liberal to very conservative.\n\nThe organization's \"Statement of Faith\" is broadly consistent with orthodox Christian beliefs, asserting the existence of one God, the divinity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, the Bible as the authoritative word of God, and the importance of living holy lives in service to God.\n\nBeyond that, the organization does not take public stands on most theological issues; instead, it offers support to individuals in a wide variety of Christian sects and denominations, including but not restricted to Anglican/Episcopalian, Baptist, Catholic, Disciples of Christ, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, Metropolitan Community Church, Pentecostal and other Charismatic churches, Presbyterian, Quaker, Seventh-day Adventist, United Church of Christ, and unaffiliated/nondenominational Christians.\n\nMembers of the Gay Christian Network have expressed a wide variety of opinions concerning gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender life and how it should be lived from a Christian perspective. For instance, the site is committed to being a safe haven both for members who believe it is okay for gay Christians to enter into healthy, committed relationships (including sex) and for those who believe that the Bible prohibits such behavior and requires chastity. On the site, these two positions have been nicknamed \"Side A\", i.e., those members who believe that homosexual activity is not sinful, and \"Side B\", i.e., those who believe that God does love gay people but does not accept homosexual activity.\n\nIt should be noted that the \"Side A\" members are \"not\" advocating promiscuity or other casual sexual behaviors; many of them are looking for a monogamous, marital relationship (e.g. a civil union). Similarly, the \"Side B\" members are \"not\" advocating an ex-gay position; many of them believe that God is not asking them to change their sexual orientation, but simply that they remain sexually chaste. As the site describes the two sides:\n\nHere at GCN, we have two types of gay Christians. On one side are those who are in gay relationships or hope to be someday. On the other side are those who view their same-sex attractions as a temptation, and strive to live celibate lives. We call these views Side A and Side B, and both are well-represented at GCN.\n\nAlthough both sides have strong contingents on the site, many members have not fully decided which side they belong to. For these members, the site provides a safe place in which to think through these issues and the resources to help people make informed decisions. Another example of the variety of opinions is that many \"Side A\" members on the site choose to remain sexually abstinent until they are in a committed relationship and/or legal marriage. These types of beliefs exemplify the conflicts that some gay Christians have encountered with the mainstream gay community.\n\nThe ministry gained national attention with the founder's appearance on the Dr. Phil television program's \"Gay-to-Straight Debate\" in 2006 where Lee argued against conversion therapy. Lee debated an ordained priest who was a former prostitute who claimed sexual reorientation therapy works. Lee and the organization's website were also featured in the opening paragraphs of the \"New York Times\" front-page article \"Gay and Seeking a Place Among Evangelicals\"\".\n\nThe organization's website has become well-known enough that it was recently mentioned as a resource in the syndicated advice column \"Annie's Mailbox\", written by two former editors for Ann Landers. The column lists GCN alongside such denominational gay Christian groups as IntegrityUSA (Episcopalian), DignityUSA (Catholic), Seventh Day Adventist Kinship International, the GLBT-focused Metropolitan Community Church denomination, and PFLAG, the nation's largest support network for parents, siblings, children and friends of GLBT individuals.\n\nThe ministry has also been mentioned (often alongside or through an interview with Lee) in articles on gay Christians and their fight for inclusion in the church, such as the article \"Progressive Christians see hope for gay marriage\" and the Associated Press article \"Gays, lesbians join the chastity movement,\" which interviews members of the site's \"Waiting for Marriage\" group. The ministry's annual conference was featured as part of an article on the gay Christian rock group Canaan, some of whose members are also regular contributors to the site. GCN members have been featured on the LOGO TV series \"Be Real\" and in OUT Magazine.\n\n"}

S. Forester. It forms part of the Horatio Hornblower series, and as a result of Forester's death in 1966, it was left unfinished. There is a one-page summary of the last several chapters of the book found on the final page, taken from notes left behind from the author. It was the eleventh and last book of the series to be published, but it is fourth in chronological sequence.\n\nSeveral other writers have written conclusions, notable efforts being that of Bob Smith, member of the C S Forester Society, published in 2010 and \"The Jamaican Affair\" by John Mahon, published in 2012 as an ebook by eNetPress.\n\nHornblower has just finished his tour blockading Brest in command of the Royal Navy sloop \"Hotspur\". As he travels back to England for his next assignment, he is asked to participate in the court martial of \"Hotspur's\" new captain and officers. \"Hotspur\" ran aground and was lost the day after Hornblower turned over command.\n\nFollowing the court martial, the officers travel back to England with Hornblower. On their way, they are pursued by a French brig, which they engage and disable. During the battle, Hornblower boards the brig and finds important papers in the French captain's quarters. Back in England, he travels to the Admiralty with the documents. He arrives at the same time as the disappointing news that the French fleet under Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve has escaped into Ferrol, Spain after an indecisive engagement.\n\nHornblower presents a daring plan to the Secretary of the Navy, to send false orders to Villeneuve, made possible because the papers brought by Hornblower include an example of Napoleon Bonaparte's new signature. The orders are to draw Villeneuve out of a safe harbour and into a decisive engagement with Admiral Nelson.\n\nThe unfinished book stops at the point where Hornblower is persuaded to attempt the mission himself. Notes left by Forester indicate that Hornblower would carry out the mission accompanied by South American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda, with Hornblower posing as his servant. They deliver the false orders to Villeneuve without arousing suspicion, prompting him to take his fleet to sea; this ultimately leads the destruction of the Franco–Spanish fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar.\n\nThis book also includes two short-stories, \"Hornblower and the Widow McCool\" (a.k.a. \"Hornblower’s Temptation\"), set early in Hornblower's career, and \"The Last Encounter\", set in 1848 when he is living on his country estate in old age and retirement.\n"}
{"id": "153372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153372", "title": "Iron Eagle", "text": "Iron Eagle\n\nIron Eagle is a 1986 Metrocolor American-Canadian action film directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Jason Gedrick and Louis Gossett Jr. While it received mixed reviews, the film earned US$24,159,872 at the U.S. box office. \"Iron Eagle\" was followed by three sequels: \"Iron Eagle II\", \"\", and \"Iron Eagle on the Attack\", with Gossett being the only actor to have appeared in all four films.\n\nThe basis of the fictional story in the film relates to real life attacks by the United States against Libya over the Gulf of Sidra, in particular the 1981 Gulf of Sidra incident.\n\nDoug Masters, son of veteran U.S. Air Force pilot Col. Ted Masters, is a hotshot civilian pilot, hoping to follow in his father's footsteps. His hopes are dashed when he receives a notice of rejection from the Air Force Academy. Making matters worse is the news that his father has been shot down and captured by the fictional Arab state of Bilya while patrolling over the Mediterranean Sea. Despite the incident occurring over international waters, the Arab state's court finds Col. Masters guilty of trespassing over their territory and sentences him to hang in three days. Seeing that the U.S. government will do nothing to save his father's life, Doug decides to take matters into his own hands and come up with his own rescue mission. He requests the help of Col. Charles \"Chappy\" Sinclair, a Vietnam veteran pilot currently in the Air Force Reserve, who, while not knowing Col. Masters personally, had a favorable run-in with him years prior to meeting Doug and \"knew the type.\" Chappy is skeptical at first; but Doug convinces him that, with his friends, he has full access to the airbase's intelligence and resources and can give him an F-16 fighter for the mission. To Doug's surprise, Chappy had already begun planning a rescue operation himself after he learned the outcome of Col. Masters' trial. The combined efforts of Chappy and Doug's team result in a meticulously planned mission and the procurement of two heavily armed F-16B jets, with Doug flying the second unit.\n\nOn the day of Col. Masters' scheduled execution, Doug and Chappy fly their jets to the Mediterranean Sea and cross into Bilyan airspace. The Bilyan military responds, and in the ensuing battle Doug and Chappy take out three MiG-23 fighters and destroy an airfield, with Chappy's plane being hit by anti-aircraft fire. He tells Doug to climb to a high altitude and play the tape he made him the night before, then his engine fails and Doug listens as Chappy's fighter goes down. Chappy's recorded voice gives Doug encouragement and details that help him to complete the mission and rescue his father. Making the enemy believe he is leading a squadron, Doug threatens the enemy state into releasing his father for pickup. Before Doug lands his plane, Col. Masters is shot by a sniper, causing Doug to destroy the airbase and engulf the runway with napalm to keep the army at bay while he lands and picks up his wounded father. Just as they take off, Doug and his father encounter another group of MiGs led by Col. Akir Nakesh, himself an ace pilot. The lone F-16 and Nakesh's MiG engage in a dogfight until a missile from Doug finishes off Nakesh. Low on fuel and ammunition, the F-16 is pursued by the other enemy MiGs when a squadron of U.S. Air Force F-16s appear, warding off the MiGs before escorting Doug and his father to Ramstein Air Base in West Germany.\n\nWhile Col. Masters is being treated for his wounds, Doug is reunited with Chappy, who had ejected from his plane and was picked up by an Egyptian fishing trawler. The two are summoned by an Air Force judiciary panel for their reckless actions. Seeing that any form of punishment for the duo would expose an embarrassing lapse in Air Force security, the panel forgoes prosecution as long as Doug and Chappy never speak of their operation to anyone. In addition, Chappy convinces the panel to grant Doug admission to the Air Force Academy. Days later, a plane assigned by the President returns to the U.S., reuniting Doug, Chappy, and Col. Masters with family and friends.\n\n\nAccording to writer/director Sidney J. Furie, the film's working title was \"Junior Eagle\". The script was turned down by every studio before it was picked up by Joe Wizan, former head of 20th Century Fox. Wizan then handed the script to producer Ron Samuels, who likened it to the old John Wayne westerns.\nAlthough their F-16s are featured in the movie poster, the United States Air Force has a long-standing policy about not cooperating on any film involving the theft of an aircraft. Consequently, the filmmakers turned to the Israeli Air Force for the necessary aerial sequences. The filming in Israel took six weeks, with the flight sequences choreographed by Jim Gavin, whose earlier works include \"Blue Thunder\".\n\nThe aircraft used for both the American and the \"Bilyan\" air forces were Israeli jets: single-seat F-16As, two-seat F-16Bs, and F-21/C-2 Kfirs simulating MiG-23s (the latter painted with imaginary national markings). The F-16s were given American national roundels and tail codes that only superficially resembled actual USAF markings, but retained their Israeli desert camouflage, a paint scheme that has never been used on USAF F-16s. The cockpit displays depicted in the film were all simulated, and did not bear any resemblance to an early model F-16's actual instrumentation (with the exception of the heads-up display, which was somewhat accurate). Additionally, the \"Hades\" bomb employed by Doug against the Bilyan airfield was a fictional weapon, though its effects were similar to real-life napalm.\n\nThe character of Colonel Charles \"Chappy\" Sinclair was inspired by the real life U.S. Air Force General Daniel \"Chappie\" James, Jr. General James was a member of the famed all-black Tuskegee Airmen, and also flew fighter jets in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He later became the first black four-star General in U.S. history.\n\nThe soundtrack album was issued by Capitol Records on LP and cassette, and later on compact disc. It features songs by Queen, King Kobra, Eric Martin, Dio, Adrenalin, and more.\n\nIn 2008, Varèse Sarabande released the original musical score by Basil Poledouris as part of their CD Club.\n\n\"Iron Eagle\" earned US$24,159,872 at the U.S. box office. Although the movie was not a major success at the cinema, it generated US$11 million in home video sales, enough to justify a sequel.\n\nKevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called the film \"a total waste of time\", saying it \"achieves a kind of perfection of awfulness that only earnest effort can produce.\" \"Variety\" magazine commented that the film has \"breakneck action and some dandy dogfights\", but the dialogue is simply laughable.\n\n\"Iron Eagle\" was released on VHS and Betamax by CBS/FOX Video in 1986. On October 1, 2002, it was released on DVD. On February 3, 2009, it was reissued on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in a double-feature set with the 1993 film \"Last Action Hero\".\n\n"}

In reality the performer is supporting the prop, and countering his or her movement relative to the prop. \n\nMichael Moschen is originally credited for developing several of the techniques for ball isolations (as well as hoops and other props) and since his original performance of 'Light' in the late 1980s, the idea has developed into a wide variety of techniques. One of the most important developments was the combination of crystal ball isolations and body-popping/locking/waving dance styles, as seen in the styles of, amongst others, Nik Robson and Matt Hennem in the '90s.\n"}

She is one of the main characters of the show and is portrayed by Catherine Tate. She has since gone on to be the main character of a number of specials.\n\nJoannie is most often referred to as \"Nan\". She is an obnoxious cockney woman in her seventies who frequently swears at and criticises other people. She is often visited by her well-mannered grandson, Jamie (Mathew Horne) whom she refers to when visitors come \"'e ain't got a job\", even though Jamie is in fact at university. His visits usually start off well enough, with Nan showing how grateful she is that he has come to see her. However, the situation usually takes a turn for the worst after she starts to make unfavourable comments about her neighbours, family, or home help visitors. Nan is mostly very pleasant to visitors, but after they leave, she criticises and rants about them. Sketches in series one show Jamie taking her to a pound shop, which ends with shambolic consequences. Joannie complains to her grandson about her home help visitor, whom she refers to as a \"fucking Māori\". She also calls her new great-grandchild ugly. Her catchphrase, delivered at the crucial point of each sketch, is \"What a fucking liberty!\"\n\nIn series two, Nan spends less time in her flat. She makes a disastrous visit to the doctor and spends two weeks in hospital. True to form, she does not suffer in silence, complaining about her fellow patients, accusing a nurse of stealing from her and caustically surveying the food menu. While in hospital, her grandson brings his first girlfriend to visit her. Unfortunately, his girlfriend has an abnormally large nose, provoking Nan's insulting behaviour as she becomes fixated with it, even offering her some old sheets to use for tissues. Another sketch sees Joannie arrive home from her friend Lena's funeral, where she is very upset, until she realises that the deceased actually owed her £15. She quickly gets over her grief and is overcome with rage, coupled by the fact she had spent another £25 on a wreath. In the last episode of Series 2, Peter Kay guest stars as one of Nan's friends who thinks Jamie is gay and describes it as a disability. In the 2005 Christmas special, a sketch features Nan attending a Christmas party in an old people's care home. Charlotte Church makes a guest appearance as herself, where she starts to sing a Christmas song for the guests, which prompts Nan to exclaim, \"what a load of ole' shit!\"\n\nIn series three, Leslie Phillips plays another of Nan's friends, who is himself very much like her, evident when he says \"What a fucking liberty\" after Nan visits him in hospital and leaves him a present which he did not like, she had also used the phrase after receiving the same gift, which she re-gifted . Sheila Hancock appears as Nan's sister June, who lives in Spain and is equally as foul-mouthed as Nan. They reveal that most of their family were London gangland career criminals and mass murderers, with nicknames such as \"Clownface\", \"Wallopnuts\" and \"Longsocks\". Nan also made a characteristic appearance on \"The Paul O'Grady Show\", in which she was pleased to discover his show had bought her a new armchair, but soon got annoyed when she learned that they had entered her house without her permission to deliver it, upon which she stormed off the set, exclaiming \"Paul O'Grady? What a load of old shit!\" Nan has at least one daughter, Diane, who is the mother of Jamie and a granddaughter, Gail, who bore Nan's \"ugly\" great-grandchild, Francesca. She initially believes the child to have been named Tesco's. The Christmas 2007 special introduced us to Diane herself, played by Kathy Burke, who was exactly like Nan in that she swore at and criticized people behind their backs. The sketch ends with both of them saying \"What a fucking liberty!\" together.\n\nIn a sketch made especially for \"Comic Relief 2007\", Nan appears on the game show, \"Deal or No Deal\", hosted by Noel Edmonds. In the sketch, Nan plays a game of \"Deal or No Deal\", in which she uncovers the five highest amounts of money in the first five boxes. As the boxes are opened, she makes an offensive comment about the player opening it, targeting their weight, earrings, and glasses. Being given an offer of £199 by the Banker, Nan accepts the offer happily, having already cheated and looked in her box and found that it only contained £50. Later in 2007, she did a Sport Relief sketch, about the World Cup. In 2010, she appeared on Comic Relief, receiving a cheque for her local community centre. Nan has also appeared in Holby City's hospital, because of her ingrown toenail, a 2013 Children in Need sketch.\n\n"}

The Autobots and Decepticons arrive here and quickly learn that the planet is under Quintesson control, after one of the planet's artificial rings-used to gather and fire energy-disables both their ships. A massive battle then ensues between the Cybertronians and the Sharkticons, with the Sharkticons later abandoning the Quintessons in temporary favor of Megatron. However, the awakening of a massive Quintesson jellyfish known as the Hydratron-which while dormant had served as a continent/city for the inhabitants of the planet-proved devastating, and the Autobots and the Decepticons eventually left the planet behind. One benefit of their visit was that Aquatron was freed from Quintesson rule and fell to the jurisdiction of a massive race of underwater Transformers, including one known as Leviacon. The planet was also inhabited by the Pirahnacons, a deadly race that fed upon Transformers.\n\nKnown inhabitants of Aquatron include:\n\n\nAthenia is a planet where the first Galactic Olympics take place in 2005.

It is a small, burned-out husk of a planet in distant space, easily mistaken for a smudge on a map. It apparently supported a civilization at one point, as abandoned structures are seen on the surface. The surface is desolate and lacks vegetation, but some native lifeforms still exist, including an enormous spider.\n\nFollowing Unicron’s attack on Cybertron in 2005, the Autobots reclaimed Cybertron, and the surviving Decepticons (who were without their leader Galvatron at the time) were forced to withdraw to Chaar, where they struggled to eke out an existence, relying on the meager amounts of Energon that could be acquired from other worlds. Eventually, Cyclonus set out to find Galvatron but, in his absence, the Quintessons supplied the Decepticons with Energon in return for their assistance in launching an attack against the Autobots. With the return of Galvatron, the alliance was restructured, but the ensuing attack on Cybertron ended in failure, resulting in the Decepticons again returning to Chaar, which served as their base of operations for the remainder of the series.\n\nAfter Earth and Cybertron, Chaar appeared in more episodes of the original television series than any other planet.\n\nChaar was also mentioned in \"\", but as an asteroid belt, not a planet.\n\nIn \"Transformers Animated\", Strika leads \"Team Chaar\" which consists of Spittor, Cyclonus, Oil Slick, and Blackout.\n\nCheyne is an arid desert world whose culture is similar to the Wild West of the late 19th century United States.\n\nIn \"\", Circuit Planet was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun.

It is referred to as Gigalonia in \"Transformers: Galaxy Force\", the Japanese version of the show. Much like how Velocitron is referred to as both \"Velocitron\" and \"Speed Planet\", Gigantion has a similar dual name. Its actual name was revealed in the episode \"Balance\".\n\nGigantion is home to one of the four Cyber Planet Keys and is one of the four ancient Transformer colonies. The titanic Transformers of Gigantion are large and powerful where their size are compared the combined forms of the known Combiners on both the Autobots' side and the Decepticons' side. The Gigantion Transformers are fortunately not much given to violence and warfare. Most are gentle and peaceful, desiring only to hone their skills and build ever grander structures. They work closely with the small Mini-Con Transformers, who can tackle the delicate tasks too refined for the heavy manipulators of their bulk comrades.\n\nOnce part of a star system within the Milky Way galaxy, the planet fell into a spatial rift and was transported to a distant universe. The only Transformers to escape this fate were a quartet of Mini-Cons consisting of Jolt, Six-Speed, Reverb, and Safeguard. Vector Prime eventually discovered and saved them, and they became the Mini-Con Recon Team. Each Transformer on Giant Planet has a Mini-Con partner. The larger Transformers all become construction vehicles with the Mini-Cons integrated into both modes. Gigantion's de facto leader is Metroplex. The Transformers from this world have accents that sound Scottish or Irish.\n\nThe Giant Transformers have a habit of building giant cities and abandoning them, with older cities (the oldest of which are buried deep within the planet's crust) forbidden by planetary law by erasing their data so no one could come back. The planet was once the target of an attack from the mysterious Planet X, its inhabitants having eradicated most every other civilization in their universe and seeking to subjugate Gigantion's populace as their next conquest. Gigantion's people, however, retaliated, with its inhabitants modifying themselves including their planet with help from the Cyber Planet Key into becoming large enough to combat the invasion.\n\nThis eventually led Planet X's inhabitants to use their planet-busting weapon in a last-ditch effort to win the war, but the weapon overloaded and destroyed Planet X. Horrified and saddened by their part in the extinction of an entire race, Gigantion's inhabitants remodeled themselves into construction vehicles and took up their custom of building and then abandoning cities, perhaps as a form of self-punishment, focusing their energies solely on creation, not destruction. The Giant Transformers built cities underground and used holographic images of the sky on the top to make things nice. They started at the very center where they left the greenery. They have many mottoes like \"Safety First\" and \"Always look forward, never back\". Gigantion is mentioned in the first chapter of \"\".\n\nKnown inhabitants of Gigantion include:\n\n\nGoo is the name of many garbage planets in the original Transformers television series, debuting in the season 3 miniseries \"The Five Faces of Darkness\". Goo is filled with garbage and belongs to the Junkions, and takes its name from a powerful adhesive that clings to anything unless disabled. After the Quintessons blew up Quintessa in an attempt to destroy the Autobots, the Autobots were set adrift in space until they landed on Goo. The Autobots were attacked by a giant garbage truck that killed Springer before Rodimus Prime could disable it. Later the Quintessons found out that the Autobots were alive on Goo. They made an alliance with the Decepticons, who were without their leader, Galvatron, and attacked the Autobots on Goo. When Galvatron returned, he was furious that the Decepticons had abandoned him. He attacked the Decepticons and Quintessons with an army of Sweeps, before being placated by Quintesson manipulation. As the Autobots fled, Galvatron destroyed the planet of Goo. Later, the Junkions were able to repair and resuscitate Springer. Another Goo planet was featured in the episode \"Chaos,\" where the Autobots discovered that the Decepticons had come into possession of crystals produced by the monstrous Chaos that could pierce any metal.\n\nGorlam Prime is a planet that is in the same sector of space as the Benzuli Expanse cosmic anomaly. Originally inhabited by organic beings, they progressively undergo mechanization until they achieve full mechanical status.\n\nGreengard is a paradise planet where its plants never turn brown and its flowers never wither.\n\nHive is a planet where its inhabitants are insectoids that live beneath the surface of the planet.\n\nHub is a powerful planet-spanning network of cyberformed structures. It housed the Decepticon progenitor known as the Liege Maximo. Hub was the seat of power for the Cybertronian Empire.\n\nHydrax Plateau is a planet where a younger Ratchet was dispatched to when looking for survivors of a chemical attack caused by Oil Slick. It was featured in the comic tie-ins to \"Transformers Animated\".\n\nThe name has subsequently been assigned to a region of Cybertron in the \"\" continuity.\n\nHydrus Four is the only planet on which the miracle restorative Nucleon can be found. It was mentioned in \"\" episode \"A New Hero,\" in which Blurr instructs E.R.V.I.S. to take the Sigma there.\n\nHyperion is a planet that is home to the mercenary Krakon.\n\nIn \"\", Iron Planet was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is metallic in nature and was filled with a lot of Energon. It was destroyed when the Terrorcons deprived it of its Energon.\n\nJhi is a green planet that is home to an ancient race of people with dog-like faces and elf-like ears. It was featured in Marvel Comics.\n\nThere had been different versions of Jungle Planet in the Transformers franchise:\n\nIn \"\", Jungle Planet was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It was a lush, jungle-like paradise.\n\nJungle Planet (also called the Beast Planet on occasion) is a fictional planet home to Beast Transformers in the animated television program \"\". It is referred to as Animatros in the Japanese version of the series \"\".\n\nThe ship that transported the Cyber Planet Key to this world was called Hyperborea. Home of one of four Cyber Planet Keys (which exists in the form of a statue called the Beast Totem) and ancient Transformer colonies sent to reacquire them. The Beast Totem is in a temple where there are different wall carvings of Earth's animal life. All of Jungle Planet's inhabitants have animal alternate forms. Jungle Planet is a lush, green planet that contains dangerous volcanic activity, dangerous seismic activity, lightning storms, and monstrous sentient plant. The Jungle Planet Transformers took animal alternate modes.\n\nFor a time, the Jungle Planet Transformers were leaderless leaving their world torn by violence and poverty. Many were taken under the tutelage under Zen-master Backstop in the way of non-violence and self-defense. Eventually, Scourge, a student of Backstop, grew impatient with his people's suffering and forced a rebellion against those taking advantage of the chaos, strong-arming his way into leadership position in a series of battles to determine who would be strong enough to become leader. Corrupted by his new-found power and position, Scourge forced a \"peace through tyranny\" campaign, bringing his people the peace and prosperity he promised them, but only through a dictatorship ruled by the credo of \"might makes right.\" However, Scourge couldn't totally rid himself of his old master's teachings and he enforced a strict series of laws regulating disputes being settled only through formal duels of strength with sabotage and especially unjustified death of a defeated foe as the planet's highest offense.\n\nOverhaul was sent to acquire the Cyber Planet Key here while being told not to interact with its inhabitants. This ended up being the opposite when Overhaul was rescued from a seismic activity by Backstop. While protecting Snarl from Scourge and Megatron, Overhaul was transformed into Leobreaker as a result of a combination of tapping into the power of Jungle Planet's Cyber Planet Key and scanning a wall-carving of a lion. Eventually, Leobreaker, Backstop, and Snarl convinced Optimus Prime to rethink his credo of non-interaction with local customs in order to acquire the Key.\n\nThe \"Hyperborea\" ship would later carry the people of Jungle Planet to safety (along with another ship, Ogygia), after the planet was consumed by the Black Hole. However, when the Black Hole was destroyed, the planet was restored. When the Autobots attempted to use a gigantic rocket to move the Jungle Planet back into its orbit, Galvatron attacked and damaged the rocket. The Jungle Planet threatened to crash into Cybertron. The combined strength of Scourge, the Autobots, the former Decepticons (Dark Crumplezone, Ransack, Thunderblast, and Thundercracker), and their allies from the various planets were able to combine their strength and move the rocket back into place.\n\nKnown inhabitants of Jungle Planet include:\n\n\nAlso on Jungle Planet are generic Transformers that each resemble a different animal such as a Brontosaurus, an owl, a lobster, a deer, a giraffe, and a tropical bird.\n\nJunkion, also known as the Planet of Junk is the home planet of the Junkions, a group of Transformers who transform into motorcycles. The planet and the Junkions first appeared in \"\". It is not really a planet in the normal sense of the word, but rather, a landfill in space that has accumulated enough mass to be held together by gravity. Depending on the storyline, it has been depicted as either a traditional spherical planet or as an elongated slab. In the original movie art and storyboards, the Planet of Junk was intended to be a spherical planet, with several rounded slabs seeming to rise off of its surface. In the end, only the \"northernmost\" rounded section of the planetoid was retained on film. In the third volume of the Devil's due comics the android Serpentor downloaded information on the history of Cybertron from Soundwave. Mentioned among that information was the Quintessons, Alpha Trion, Megatron and Soundwave, the planet of Junk, a warrior named Optimus Primal and the Autobot Matrix of Leadership. In \"\", the Autobots aboard the Ark come upon the planet Junkion where they meet Wreck-Gar and the other Junkions. It is later discovered that Junkion is made up of the wreckage of various ships drawn together by the gravity of the Requiem Blaster, and subsequently ripped apart when the blaster is stolen by the Decepticons.\n\nKnown inhabitants of Junkion are:\n\n\nJörmungandr is a serpent-shaped planet. It was featured in the \"Beast Wars Neo\" manga where it was Cohrada's homeworld.\n\nKaiba-5 is a planet that was referenced in \"\".\n\nKlo appeared in the Marvel Comics \"Transformers\" comic book series, and is notable for being the location of the final battle of both the U.S. and UK versions of the series. Klo was introduced in issue #80 in the U.S. version, and #331 in the UK version. Klo is a beautiful, peaceful planet, rich in natural resources and inhabited by benign, harmless creatures called Klozians. The planet was invaded by Decepticons under Bludgeon's leadership, after the Transformers had won the war against Unicron. Following Unicron's death, Cybertron seemed to be in danger of being destroyed, so the Decepticons fled the planet in search of new worlds to conquer. They selected Klo, where they started mercilessly slaughtering the native Klozians. The Autobots tracked the Decepticons to Klo and attempted to rescue the Klozians, but weak leadership from Grimlock led to heavy casualties by the Autobots and their forces were nearly wiped out. Finally, a newly resurrected Optimus Prime and the Last Autobot arrived on Klo, and while Optimus Prime fought against Bludgeon, the Last Autobot resurrected the dead Autobots. Facing invincible opposition, Bludgeon and his Decepticons retreated back into space and Optimus Prime and his Autobots stayed to help the Klozians rebuild their planet.\n\nLanarq is a robotic planet who waged a centuries-long war with Xetaxxis.\n\nLithone was a planet populated by intelligent Transformer-like machine life. It was destroyed by Unicron in the Earth year 2005. The last known survivor of the planet, Kranix, was sentenced to death and executed by the Quintessons after being found \"innocent\" of an unspecified crime (It is rumored that the Quintessons often judge lifeforms with the crime of \"stealing\" Cybertron from them 12 million years prior, as seen in the Five Faces of Darkness miniseries, but Kranix was from Lithone, so the \"jury reach a verdict\" of innocent—yet Kup and Hot Rod, of Cybertron, were found innocent in the film as well).\n\nIn the script and in the Marvel Comics \"\" adaptation, the Lithonians could transform into spaceships. Lithone has also been referenced as \"Glithos\" or \"Glinthos\" due to the unclear articulation of its last surviving native, Kranix, before his execution.\n\nLucifer is a planet that is under the control of the Decepticons.\n\nLV-117 is a planet in an unknown part of space that contains dangerous robot-eating animals.\n\nMaster is a planet that appeared in the Japanese continuity as the home planet of the Headmasters and Targetmasters.\n\nMenonia is a planet that exists in an alternate dimension as seen in \"The Transformers\" episode \"Madman's Paradise.\" Its technology is based on Earth's Middle Ages and magic is prominent here. Known inhabitants of Menonina include Bird People, Dragons, Humans, Reptile-Birds (a Dragon/Pterosaur creature), Tree-Centaurs (a race of centaur/ent creatures), and Wood Men. Menonia is ruled by a wizard known as the Golden One.\n\nMethuselah is an ancient dead planet.\n\nMicro is a planet that is the home of the Micromasters.\n\nMolryus Minor is a planet inhabited by carnivorous isopods that appears in the \"Classified\" novels.\n\nMonacus is a gambling asteroid made famous in \"The Transformers\" episode \"The Gambler.\" It was also known for being visited by bounty hunters like Devcon.\n\nMoriturus is a planet that was consumed by the Unicron Singularity.\n\nMumu-Obscura was a militarily contested and strategically significant world in the Eigerson-48 star system, until a group of warriors called the Reapers exterminated its population and poisoned its resources. It was featured in IDW Comics.\n\nNebulos, sometimes known as Nebulon, is a planet in the fictional Transformers universes.\n\nNebulos is a somewhat Earth-like planet far away from both Earth and Cybertron, and is the home to a humanoid race known as the Nebulans. The planet and its inhabitants were first introduced as the back story for Hasbro's new Headmaster and Targetmaster toys, later expanded by the Powermaster toys. These toys are robots that transform into vehicles or animals, and include Nebulan sidekicks that transform into the robot's head, into a weapon, or into the vehicle's engine. The toys themselves never expanded on Nebulon or its inhabitants, but both the TV series (in its fourth and final season) and the Marvel Comics comic book did, with drastically different, mutually inconsistent versions. In the TV series, the Nebulons were shown to be green-skinned. The planet Nebulos does not exist in the Japanese continuation of the franchise. Thus, with no Nebulos and no Nebulons, a different origin was given for the Headmaster and Targetmaster Transformers.\n\nIn the Marvel comic book, Fortress Maximus had grown weary of the civil war on Cybertron, and led a group of Autobots in search of a new planet where they could live in peace. They settled on Nebulos, but the Decepticons followed them. The comic book version of Nebulos is an idyllic, peaceful world where war has long since been discontinued and all weapons have been locked away. It is governed by a council of peers. The arrival of the Transformers scared the Nebulans, and they were forced to hold an emergency council meeting to deal with these strange new creatures. The Autobots wanted to live in peace with the Nebulans, but the Decepticons wanted to conquer them and kill the Autobots, so the Autobot-Decepticon civil war restarted on Nebulon. Both sides allied themselves with Nebulans, the Autobots generally with common people who had become familiar with them and did not see them as a threat, and the Decepticons generally with criminals or corrupt politicians. The Nebulans, fearing the Transformers' civil war would plunge their own world back into war, finally banished the Transformers and their Nebulan sidekicks back into space, where they finally arrived on Earth.\n\nIn the TV series, the Transformers arrived on Nebulos in the three-part episode \"The Rebirth\", which were the only episodes of the fourth season, and the last episode ever produced in the United States. The Autobots' spaceship was plunged to Nebulos accidentally by a gigantic power surge from the Plasma Energy Chamber, and the Decepticons followed them. The TV show version of Nebulos is a hostile, dying world, where a group of eleven rulers known as \"The Hive\" controls the entire world from an underground city, abusing their power for their personal pleasure and oppressing the workers with various mechanical devices controlled by their minds. Upon seeing the Autobots, the Nebulon workers mistook them for machines controlled by The Hive, and imprisoned them, later to destroy them. However, an attack by the Decepticons convinced the workers that the Autobots were good guys, and so they were released and allied themselves with the workers. The Decepticons did the same with the members of The Hive (after being co-erced).\n\nIn the Ladybird books continuity, the Nebulans were a race of small transforming robots. The Nebulans have appeared once more in IDW Publishing's new continuity, in . Their planet was attacked by Thunderwing as part of an unholy pact to rejuvenate Cybertron. Despite the best efforts of the local Decepticon cell (led by Dreadwind and Darkwing) much of the planet was devastated. It also appeared chronologically earlier in the issue on Ultra Magnus, where Scorponok was already seen to be developing the Headmaster process. Nebulos was also mentioned by Swindle in the \"Transformers Animated\" episode, \"Decepticon Air\".\n\nNebulos is also featured in several stories of the \"Ask Vector Prime\" Facebook feature. Among these were the \"Armada\" storyline, in which the Nebulans Hi-Q and Arcana were responsible for Overload and Rollout being merged into a Headmaster being in order to save them both from debilitating medical conditions, and a split reality in which the monstrous Zarak Maximus was born from the fusion of Mo Zarak with the remains of Fortress Maximus and Scorponok.\n\n\nNew Kaon is a planet where all kinds of Decepticons that are fleeing from the Autobots take refuge. It was featured in the comic book tie-in to \"Transformers Animated\".\n\nIn \"\", Ocean Planet was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is mostly covered in an ocean.\n\nParadise is a planet that is a natural wonderland of vast jungles, roaring rivers and waterfalls, smoking volcanoes, and beasts of all shapes and sizes, all co-existing in harmony with the tribes of human-like beings living there. Although choosing to live a primitive existence dressing in robes made from animal skins and living in yurts, the people of the planet Paradise defy appearances by being intelligent, well-spoken creatures.\n\nIn the \"Transformers: Headmasters\" episode \"Head Formation of Friendship,\" Paradise was targeted by Galvatron and the Decepticons who were on a quest to drain the energy from planets until they are driven away by the Autobots.\n\nParadron is a peaceful, Energon-rich planet, accessible only through a vortex. Several Autobots fled there when the war against the Decepticons began and set up a colony there. The Autobot Sandstorm was one of the inhabitants of this planet. It was featured in \"The Transformers\" episode \"Fight or Flee\" when the Decepticons discovered this planet and enslaved the pacifist Autobots. After the Autobots rescued the pacifist Autobots, Rodimus Prime had Paradron destroyed with most of its inhabitants being transferred to Cybertron.\n\nIn Fun Publications' \"Shattered Glass\" storyline, Paradron was a prison planet where Optimus Prime exiled some of his more dangerous Autobot enemies, including Ultra Magnus and Wreck-Gar.\n\nPequod is an oceanic planet that is home to large whale-like creatures called the Klud. It was featured in Marvel Comics.\n\nPirate Planet is a planet where space pirates of all kinds store their loot.\n\nIn \"\", Plains Planet (also called Grass Planet) was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is mostly filled with grasslands.\n\nPlanet Q is a desert planet that was featured in \"\". It was home to Alpha Q, Scorponok, and the Terrorcons, and was consumed by Unicron prior to the start of the series. Alpha Q's desire to restore his home planet using Unicron's power served as his primary motivation throughout \"Energon\", and was also the reason for Rodimus' willingness to work with him.\n\nPlanet X is the name of two different planets in the \"Transformers Universe, the first of which was seen in \"\".\n\nThe Planet X featured in \"\" was first seen in a recording found by the human Lori and the Velocitronian leader, Override, after the latter's battle with Scourge on Giant Planet. It was shown to be a highly advanced world like Cybertron, purple in color, with two golden rings around it forming an X pattern. Later, it would be revealed that Planet X was the dominant force in the alternate universe that Giant Planet had been drawn into. It was capable of non-orbital space travel and annihilating less advanced civilizations it came across. This, however, caused life in its universe to 'die' and, in an attempt to rectify the problem, its denizens sought out another life-rich planet to subjugate. The planet they found, Giant Planet, did not take kindly to being invaded, and its inhabitants reformatted themselves into larger forms with help of the Cyber Planet Key in order to combat the threat of the off-worlders.\n\nLeft with few options and little hope of victory, the inhabitants of Planet X powered up their ultimate weapon: a Death Star-like planetary cannon, in order to wipe out the transformers on Giant Planet. Unfortunately, the cannon was too powerful for them to control and the result destroyed their world. The survivors, including and , were scattered all across their universe, and were eventually thrown into the Transformers' proper universe. Believing Giant Planet to be at fault for their home planet's destruction, the various Transformers plotted revenge against them. In addition, the Giant Planet Transformers also felt at least partially responsible for Planet X's annihilation. This created their custom of building cities and then abandoning them, which became a perpetual, planet-wide act of penance. Eventually, Sideways and Soundwave managed to return to Giant Planet, and sought the Cyber Planet Keys in order to exact their revenge.\n\n\"Ask Vector Prime\" would later feature Planet X in additional storylines, often involving its origin. In one reality, it was the broken body of Unicron from \"\", shunted into another dimension by the energies of the Matrix of Leadership. Arriving on the edge of the Earth solar system of that reality, Unicron set out to repair himself but was hindered by the actions of Megatron utilizing a Star Harvester. As in the \"Energon\" series, Unicron revived many of the Transformers he had previously consumed in an effort to expedite his recovery, and the new race renamed their home Planet X. They then traveled to the world of the \"Victory\" series and attacked it, but the efforts of the Autobots using Zone energy split the planet into two: the beautiful world seen in \"Victory\" and one virtually identical to the \"Cybertron\" version, which was later destroyed by the inhabitants of an alternate Gigantion known as Gigalonia. Other versions included a \"Cybertron\" Planet X that was once part of the Liege Maximo's Cybertronian Empire, and another in which Planet X was once the home of a smaller scale Unicron who used a cyber key to unite himself with his former homeworld and domain.\n\nPz-zazz is a highly technological planet. Pz-zazz was hopelessly corrupted by crime until an ancient bird icon was returned to its place and purified the planet.\n\nQuintessa is the home planet of the infamous Quintessons as seen in \"\". Unlike most other planets, Quintessa was shown having a more spiral-like shape than a simple sphere. The Quintessons eventually destroyed their own home planet in the Generation 1 continuity. In the \"Prime\" continuity, Quintessa is the capital of the so-called \"Quintesson Co-Prosperity Sphere,\" and its location is a closely guarded secret.\n\nRegalis V is a planet filled with thick jungles and filled with ambulatory plants. It was featured in the \"Beast Machines\" episode \"Home Soil\" as the planet where the Cybertronian crew that Botanica was a part of landed.\n\nRegulon Four is a planet in the Regulon star system. It is home to the Regulon Metalmongers. It was referenced in \"The Transformers\" episode \"The Rebirth\" Pt. 2 where Kup and his platoon were once stranded on this planet and beset by the Regulon Metalmongers.\n\nRigel 6 is a planet that was featured in Marvel Comics. It is known for its grease pits which features Turboworm Wrestling.\n\nRigel III is a planet that is home to Rorza, a rocket-cycle racer. It was featured in Marvel Comics.\n\nIn \"\", Rock Planet was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It has a lot of rocky environments.\n\nScarvix is a planet that was once home to Death's Head. It was featured in the UK Marvel Comics.\n\nTalos Four is a planet that was governed by a single monarchy.\n\nTaros Four is a planet with advanced weaponry that is capable of downing a Transformer. It was featured in \"\"\n\nTasmos is a planet that is featured in \"Beast Wars Neo\".\n\nThrull is the planet that Galavatron ended up on after being thrown out of Unicron as seen in \"The Transformers\" episode \"The Five Faces of Darkness\" Pt. 1. An inhospitable world consisting of plasma lava and rock, its environment led to the degradation of Galvatron's logic circuits, making him even more unstable and dangerous than he had been previously. Upon being revived and escaping the planet, Galvatron fired an energy blast that caused Thrull to explode.\n\nTorkulon is a planet whose main source of commerce is psychotherapy. Galvatron was brought there for treatment in \"The Transformers\" episode \"Webworld\", following his increasingly erratic behavior following the event of \"\". The entire planet was a living computer whose circuitry was woven by arachnid-like beings known as the Alya, and manipulated by a furry humanoid race of size comparable to the Transformers themselves. Despite multiple methods used, the Torkulon were unable to cure Galvatron, who madness infected the planet and caused it to go out of control. Galvatron himself then destroyed the Torkulon computer core, leaving the planet devastated, though with the possibility of rebuilding.\n\nTwin Star is a group of two diametrically opposed planets Sperity and Tourin. It was featured in \"\".\n\n\nUnicron is a fictional character from the \"Transformers\" universe and toyline. Created by Floro Dery, he was introduced in the 1986 animated film \"\". and reprised that role in Atari's 2003 Transformers video game. Unicron is a prodigiously large robot whose scale reaches planetary proportions, and he is also able to transform into a mechanical planet. Unicron's origin has expanded over the years from simply being a large robot to being a God of chaos who devours realities. He often employs the help of Decepticons in his work. In some stories, he is considered part of the origin of the Decepticon forces.\n\nVaras Centralus is a planet situated in the Kol star system. It is featured in IDW Comics.\n\nVehicon is a planet where Reverse Convoy is the leader of the Autobots.\n\nVelocitron (known as Speedia in \"Galaxy Force\" and Speed Planet in promotional materials) is a fictional planet featured in \"\" and is the location of one of four ancient Transformer colonies that lost contact with the home world of Cybertron long ago, along with Earth, Jungle Planet, and Gigantion. Each of these colonies possess a Cyber Planet Key, containing a fragment of the power of Primus. The name Velocitron is used infrequently. The planet is more commonly referred to as \"the Speed Planet\" or simply \"Speed Planet.\" The planet's full, formal name appears to be \"Velocitron, the Speed Planet.\"\n\nA variable desert planet, it was terraformed into a global race track with the pursuit of perfect speed and performance the primary motivating force in its society and culture. Disputes are settled in formal races with the winner claiming victory over the dispute as well. Automated repair machines maintain the race courses, which include tracks featuring various environments and obstacles as well as simpler straightforward courses. Characteristics of Velocitron's inhabitants include translucent wheels of unknown material, and double-barrelled long-range weaponry.\n\nThe planet's leader is Override as she is the fastest of all Velocitronian Transformers with no equal planetside. She holds semi-annual planetwide races to determine the next leader with the planet's Cyber Planet Key (which exists in the form of a trophy called the Planet Cup) awarded to the winner. The location of Velocitron was first re-discovered by Megatron using the map he had stolen from Vector Prime. Vector Prime himself later located the planet as well, by studying a copy of the Atlantis Pattern found at a museum in Mexico.\n\nHot Shot felt right at home on the planet and participated in the planet-wide race alongside a few of his Autobot comrades, despite reservations by Optimus Prime who advised them not to interact with any of the inhabitants. Despite quarreling with his companion Red Alert, Hot Shot managed to overcome the challenges of Speed Planet and won the great race. In addition to gaining Override's friendship, the Autobots also learned a valuable lesson about interacting with the inhabitants of the different planets. The starship that carried the Cyber Planet Key to this world was named \"Ogygia\".\n\nIn the final episode of \"Transformers: Cybertron\" the \"Speedia 500\" race is held to determine the leader of Velocitron, which Hot Shot wins. Dirt Boss comes in second, Ransack in third, Dark Crumplezone in fourth, Brakedown in fifth, and Clocker in sixth. Override didn't even compete, as she joins the new Space Bridge project led by Optimus Prime. The name of the race is a reference to the Japanese name of the planet, which is Speedia.\n\nVelocitron is one of the planets mentioned in the first chapter of \"\" in which many Cybertronians are populated. The sequel novel \"\" features Optimus Prime and the other Autobots aboard the \"Ark\" coming to Velocitron where they meet Blurr and Override. Velocitronians are obsessed with speed, so that their lives are centered around going faster or helping others race. The Autobots soon discover a war brewing on Velocitron between Override and Ransack, the former sympathizing with the Autobots while the latter finds Decepticon philosophies more appealing. The two sides soon see conflict, and after the Ark's departure are visited not only by Megatron and the Decepticons but also by a group of pirates known as the Star Seekers under Thundertron. Velocitron in this continuity is also threatened by the instability of its sun, which is threatening to go supernova.\n\n\"\" included a mention of Velocitron by that series' version of Blurr, who notes that it consists of \"all roads, no speed limits.\"\n\nKnown inhabitants of Velocitron are:\n\n\nVs'Qs is actually a moon, not a planet. Vs'Qs is a barren, desolate place, devoid of any natural life. Vs'Qs was the place where the body of Optimus Prime happened to land on, having been blasted off into space randomly after his death. The Matrix of Leadership contained within the body was found during the Matrix Quest.\n\nWednesday is an ocean planet that is the home of Princess Rage, a Transformer who can turn into a jellyfish.

It included a recording company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), book publishing, music publishing, a Latin record division (Maverick Musica), and a television production company. The first releases for the company were Madonna's 1992 coffee table publication \"Sex\" and her studio album \"Erotica\", which were released simultaneously to great controversy.\n\nDeMann was bought out of the company for a reported $20 million in 1998. Guy Oseary increased his stake in the company and took control as Chairman and CEO. Madonna and Dashev left in 2004 after a lawsuit between Maverick and Warner Music Group.\n\nMaverick Records was launched in April 1992 as a unit of the Maverick entertainment company. It was a joint venture between Madonna, Frederick DeMann, Veronica \"Ronnie\" Dashev and Time Warner, and its name was combined from the names of three of the founders; Madonna, Veronica and Frederick. The company had divisions for recording, music publishing, television, film, merchandising and book publishing. The venture was part of a $60 million recording and business deal between Madonna and Time Warner . It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equalled at that time only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony.\n\nAt the time of its launch. the company was bi-coastal; having offices in both New York City and Los Angeles.

The first releases for the company were Madonna's 1992 coffee table publication, \"Sex\" and her studio album \"Erotica\" which were released simultaneously to great controversy.\n\nMaverick's first commercial success was with the self-titled debut album by Seattle-based grunge band Candlebox. Released in 1993, the album would be RIAA-certified quadruple platinum in the United States. The following year, the label signed Canadian musician Alanis Morissette, whose third album (and Maverick debut) \"Jagged Little Pill\" was released in 1995, and would be eventually certified 16x platinum in the U.S. (with international sales of $33 million)–making it the best selling album in the label's history, and of the 1990s.\n\nDeMann was bought out of the company for a reported $20 million in 1998, after which Guy Oseary increased his stake in the company and took control as chairman and CEO.\n\nThroughout the 1990s to the middle 2000s, Maverick would also release albums by Erasure, Michelle Branch, Meshell Ndegeocello, U.N.V., Dana Dane, N-Phase, Dalvin DeGrate, The Prodigy, Cleopatra, Tyler Hilton, Muse, Deftones, Summercamp, No Authority and William Orbit. \"I'm happy with Maverick as a label,\" observed The Prodigy's Liam Howlett. \"They respect their bands; even the ones who aren't selling.\"\n\nBy the early 2000s, Maverick saw its commercial fortunes decline and business operations financially unravel. In March 2004, the label and Madonna filed suit against Warner Music Group (and its former parent company, Time Warner), claiming that mismanagement of resources and poor bookkeeping had cost the company millions of dollars. Warner filed a countersuit, alleging that Maverick had lost tens of millions of dollars on its own.\n\nOn June 14, 2004, the dispute was resolved when Maverick shares owned by Madonna and Dashev were purchased — which effectively exiled the two of them from the company, as it then became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Music Group. Then Maverick CEO Guy Oseary, meanwhile, retained his position until WMG purchased his label shares in 2006. The same year, the band Lillix, which at the time was signed to the label, claimed that the Maverick label no longer existed and that all the artists were now handled by Warner Bros. directly. In 2007 the record company folded.\n\nTwo of the label's most successful artists, Alanis Morissette and Michelle Branch, left in the late 2000s. Branch left in 2007 after disbanding The Wreckers, while Morissette left in 2009 after the release of \"Flavors of Entanglement\". Madonna's recording contract remained with Warner Bros. Records under a separate agreement until 2009.\n\nIn 2001, Maverick Picture Company was rebranded as simply Maverick Films and was solely managed by Madonna and Guy Oseary, CEO of another Maverick division, Maverick Records. In 2004, Madonna and Dashev were bought out of Maverick after a lawsuit with Warner Music Group and they no longer have an interest in the company. In August 2008, company head Mark Morgan and Oseary split with Oseary retaining the rights to the Maverick name while Morgan retain ownership of the company's projects and changing the name to Imprint Entertainment.<ref</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Maverick Records brought teenage file-sharer, Whitney Harper, to court and won the case. Harper was ordered to pay $750 per song for the three dozen uploaded on the Internet. The case is known as \"Harper v. Maverick Recording Co.\".\n\nIn 2011, Maverick Records co-released Greyson Chance's debut album \"Hold On 'til the Night\", but other than that the label has remained in dormancy.\n\n\n\n"}

The first edition was held in 2004 and usually takes place in November at le Palais des Congrès de Montréal. The summit was founded in order to meet the needs of the rough 9000 video game workers in Quebec. The mission of the summit is to expand the exposure of the video game community and industry in Quebec as well as develop the expertise of the Quebec video game industry. MIGS is currently the leading professional gaming summit of the East Coast, and is arguably the largest game development event in Canada. The overall aims of MIGS are to promote, train, network, and hire potential players in the gaming industry. Professionals attending the summit partake in lectures and presentations largely oriented around how to better specific aspects of the industry, such as art and VFX, business, and design. Currently, MIGS has partnered with many of the leading electronic and game development companies in Canada, including Ubisoft and Warner Bros. Games. The Montreal International Gaming Summit is networked similarly to the Electronic Entertainment Expo, using the same application in order to facilitate interaction between industry players and their associates. It was only in 2008, during the fifth summit, did MIGS become an event that was open to the public. 2013 marked the tenth annual Montreal International Gaming Summit. \n\nThe Business Lounge is designed in order to establish collaboration and finalize ideas by key decision makers in the industry. It is located away from the summit itself as only professional members of the industry may attend. Most corporate figures that attend the summit also make appearances at the business lounge, as it is a hub for most corporate decisions at the summit. Attendees at the lounge may also attend exclusive cocktail events, where they may interact with other corporate figures and keynotes speakers at the summit.\n\nThe Online Meeting Application is an application that is utilized at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). This application is used to book meetings with summit attendees. The application was developed by Game Connection, and allows attendees to contact industry figures directly, manage scheduling, and promote themselves as players in the industry.\n\nThe Expo Zone is the central attraction at MIGS. It is where all presentations and showcases for new products are displayed. Video game artists also feature their work in the Expo Zone. Most readily available attractions at MIGS are available in the Expo Zone. It is also possible for attendees to book places in order to promote themselves and their products. The Expo Zone is the most readily available attraction for general interest attendees who are not part of the professional industry. Since MIGS opened to the public in 2008, the Expo Zone has become the primary attraction for the general public.\n\nMIGS 2012 was held on November 13 and November 14 at the Hilton Montreal Bonaventure. The theme for the year's event was \"The Future. Unknown\", and was focused on the upcoming trends in the video game industry as well as new technologies and breakthroughs that could impact the future of video game development. The opening keynote was presented by Tim Sweeney, founder of Epic Games, on some of the current technologies used in games. The second day's opening keynote was presented by Peter Molyneux, currently the CEO and founder of 22Cans with a talk about game design. Finally the event was closed out by a \"Brain Dump\" session with various industry professionals.\n\nThe following is a list of the current partners and sponsors of the MIGS \n\n"}

It is one of the earliest extant Chinese films, but a portion is still missing. Like most Chinese films from this period, it is a black-and-white silent film with both Chinese and English intertitles.\n\nThe English title is ironic, because the mother in the story hardly enjoyed any happiness in her life.\n\nAfter the birth of her children, a rural mother becomes so devoted to them that she completely neglects her ill-tempered husband. When her baby becomes ill, she even tries to commit suicide, fortunately the baby recovers. Her husband, who works for a wealthy man, is blamed and fired after the man's son squanders twenty thousand dollars. He sulkily returns home, beats up his naughty son, and accidentally drinks himself to death with the wrong type of alcohol. After his death, the mother works as a seamstress and manages to send all her children to a private school. At school, the children are bullied by a kid from a wealthy family, but the teacher never punishes him.\n\nDecades later, the children are all married. The eldest son has a crude wife who disrespects the mother. The second daughter-in-law is respectful but unhealthy. The eldest daughter lives in a wealthy household with servants, but she is completely unfilial. Even when she returns home for brief visits (just to impress the neighbors, as she says), she treats the entire family with contempt. Another daughter, who is widowed, also lives away from home.\n\nBoth sons set off for jobs in the city, and the mother is left behind with the second daughter-in-law. The eldest son wants to send money home but is stopped by his stern wife. He gives the money to his brother to send home, but the second son squanders all the money on a lascivious woman. With no income to pay the rent, the mother and the second daughter-in-law have to seek shelter with her eldest daughter. The daughter accepts them, but calls them servants in front of her friends. Her ill-tempered husband is disgusted by the mother's impoverished appearance and lashes out at her.\n\nThe second son loses his job as a result of persistent tardiness and poor performance. He tries to borrow money from his mistress but discovers that she has a new lover who happens to be his best friend. Meanwhile, the mother is driven away from her daughter's house and comes to the city to visit the brothers. Eventually she falls terminally ill, and all her children reunite before her deathbed. The mother tells the second son to kneel in front of his wife, and is pleased that he finally repents.\n\nThere have been two remakes, the 1937 film \"Song for a Mother\" (慈母曲) by Zhu Shilin, and the 1953 Hong Kong film \"A Mother Remembers\" (慈母淚) by Chun Kim.\n"}
{"id": "43043497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43043497", "title": "Mountain (video game)", "text": "Mountain (video game)\n\nMountain is a simulation video game developed by David OReilly and published by Double Fine Productions. It was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS and Android in July 2014. The game is an idle game in which the only influence the player can have on the game is at the start of the game where the player is tasked to draw objects. The game is designed to be played in the background while the player uses other applications.\n\n\"Mountain\" is described by its creator David OReilly as a \"Mountain Simulator, Relax em’ up, Art Horror etc.\" game, featuring little interactivity from the player. Upon starting the game, the player is asked to draw responses to a series of questions, described by OReilly as \"more psychologically invasive than anything Facebook wants to know about you\". The game uses that input to generate a model of a mountain, floating in space, surrounded by a small sphere of atmosphere. At this point, the game lacks significant interactivity; while the player can rotate the view around the mountain and zoom in and out, they cannot affect the mountain in any way. The game is set to be run in the background as the player does other activities on their computer.\n\nOver the course of the game, the mountain slowly rotates as accelerated time progresses through day and night cycles and through seasonal changes: the player will see snow form and melt on the mountain, and plants trees grow and wither out. Randomly, the mountain may be hit by everyday objects which then become embedded in the mountain indefinitely. The mountain periodically offers its thoughts to the player as the game progresses. After around fifty hours while the game has been running, the mountain meets its fate when it crashes into a passing giant star, ending the game, at which point the player can start the game over with a new mountain.\n\nDavid OReilly had developed a number of fictional video game sequences for the movie \"Her\" (2013). Following his involvement, OReilly had interest in creating a real video game, wanting \"to explore in patterns and iterations of patterns\". He considered the idea of simulating a mountain as \"an iconic zen thing\", and that the size of mountains dwarf that of the human experience; mountains further \"defy objectification because they can't be owned or put in a museum\". OReilly described \"Mountain\" as \"visual silence\", and that it is \"about letting go of control\" while one watches the simulation.\n\nTo develop the game, OReilly started learning the Unity engine himself. To complete \"Mountain\", gained assistance from Damien Di Fede who did most of the game's coding.\n\nOReilly had revealed the game during the Horizon video game showcase held at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles during the same week in June as the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The game was published by Double Fine Productions under their \"Double Fine Presents\" label aimed for small indie games.\n\nThe title was initially released on July 1, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and iOS platforms; the Android version was delayed until August 19, 2014 due to the cost of getting the Unity plugin for Android. OReilly had initially visioned the game to run as a background application for personal computers, and thus had not spent a great deal of time optimizing the iOS version through the Unity engine. However, within a week of its release, \"Mountain\" was one of the top-selling titles on various app store charts, prompting OReilly to develop more optimization for the iOS and pending Android versions.\n\nThe game was generally praised by reviewers as a novel concept for a game, though because of its limited interactivity, many players were discontent with the title, comparing it to a screensaver rather than a game. Zack Kotzer of \"Vice\" compared the game to the Tamagotchi toys, though lacking the need to constantly attend to the toys' demands and instead letting the player decide when to see how the mountain is progressing. Others described the title as a passive \"Katamari\" game, watching how the mountain accumulates stuff over the course of the game. Some reviewers found the title pretentious; Ben Kuchera of \"Polygon\" felt the game may have been a joke by OReilly, and expressed he lacked the same type of wonder that other journalist had found for the game.\n"}

UNAIDS estimate there to be 67,000 prostitutes in the country.\n\nProstitution between adults is legal for women and men over 18 years of age if they register with municipal authorities and carry a health certificate. Brothels must be licensed. The vast majority of prostitutes work in the informal sector, where they lack health protection. Individual police officers tolerate the operation of unlicensed brothels. \n\nChild prostitution is illegal. Penalties for pimps and clients of underage prostitutes range from four to eight years in prison. Child prostitution is common in the country, and especially in Peru’s isolated Amazonian mining communities. In the Amazonian department of Madre de Dios the illegal exploitation of gold has dramatically increased the recruitment and coercion of adolescents into prostitution through false employment offers. \n\nWhile poverty and inequality are important causes of child prostitution, part of the problem is also a social attitude that views sex--including paid sex--between adult men and adolescent girls as normal.\nLuis Gonzalez-Polar Zuzunada, president of La Restinga (an Iquitos-based nonprofit organization that works with at-risk children) said about teenage prostitution:\"It's not seen as a crime. People think that's the way it is. Here, anyone is a potential client.\" \n\nThe Peruvian government recognizes child sex tourism to be a problem, particularly in Iquitos, Madre de Dios, and Cuzco. \n\nPeru is a source, transit point, and destination for trafficked persons. The majority of human trafficking occurs within the country.\n\nMany trafficking victims are women and girls from impoverished rural regions of the Amazon, recruited and coerced into prostitution in urban nightclubs, bars, and brothels, often through false employment offers or promises of education.\n\nDomestic trafficking occurs particularly in districts located in the Andes or the Amazon jungle, to bring underage girls into cities or mining areas to work as prostitutes. Victims are recruited by friends or acquaintances and through newspaper and Internet advertisements or street posters offering employment; some victims are recruited by local employment agencies that offer poor young women from rural areas relatively well-paid \"restaurant work\" in Lima, Cusco, major coastal cities, and abroad. \nThe principal victims and groups at high risk for trafficking are children and young women from rural or poor urban areas, persons living in poverty, persons with disabilities, victims of domestic abuse, illiterate persons, and persons lacking birth certificates or other identification documents.\n\nPeru also is a destination country for some Ecuadorian and Bolivian women trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Peru as a 'Tier 2' country.\n\n"}

The term was popularised by the popular Australian ABC TV television series \"SeaChange\", which triggered the phenomenon of many city-dwellers mimicking the drama's protagonist's escape from urban life. It ultimately comes from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\". The result of this phenomenon (known as the 'sea change effect') is a rapid boom in tourism and real estate development in coastal Australia, particularly in New South Wales.\n\nA similar term, treechange, describes the movement of urbanites to the countryside.\n\nIn the television series \"SeaChange\", the main character Laura Gibson fulfils her escapist desire by leaving the city for a small seaside town after her career and family life in Melbourne falls apart. The series, which ran from 1998 to 2000, became one of the most popular programmes in Australia and focused on life outside the big city. The primary filming location for the series at Barwon Heads on the Bellarine Peninsula was the first to experience the seachange effect, with fans of the series both visiting and moving to the community. This experience was replicated in coastal towns across Australia. \n\nPeople shifting to the coast have been characterised as:\n\nThe rate of growth in rural coastal areas is 60% higher than the national average. Almost six million people already reside in coastal areas outside the mainland capitals, and a further one million are expected by 2020. In addition to people seeking a better lifestyle, the seachange phenomenon is driven by retiring baby boomers and people forced out of capital cities by high house prices. It typically involves either the purchase of a secondary (or holiday) home in, or a complete shift to, coastal areas. \n\nThe seachange effect is having both positive and adverse effects on local communities. While it has led to increased prosperity in regional areas, the phenomenon has also caused an increased burden on local governments. \n\nIn response to the influx of tourists and new residents to their jurisdictions, coastal councils from around Australia formed the National Sea Change Taskforce in 2004 to seek ways to ensure sustainable development in their communities. As at 2008 there are 68 member councils from around Australia collectively representing more than four million residents.\n\n\n\n"}

Bhadrakali Theeyattu is performed by Theeyaattunnis (\"a Brahmin community in Kerala\") whereas Ayyappan Theeyaattu is performed by Tīyyādi Nambiars (\"Ambalavasi\").\n\nBhadrakali Tiyyattu is a ritualistic dance usually performed in Bhadrakali temples, mostly in the Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam and Ernakulam districts of south-central Kerala. Pallippurathu Kavu at Kottayam (family temple of Kottarathil Sankunni) Thrikkariyoor Mahadeva Temple,Panachimangalath Bhadrakali temple(family temple of Panachimangalath Illam) near Kothamangalam,Vanarkavu at Madakkathanam, near Thodupuzha,Puthukulangara Devi Kshetram near Thiruvalla are some of the places where tiyyattu is performed during annual festivals. It is also performed as an offering at temples and houses.\n\nThe performance has many parts of which - preparation of the ritual art known as kalam (Kalamezhuthu), singing songs in praise of Bhadrakali and the performance of the dance are a few. Kalamezhuthu is done during the day using natural coloured powders on the floor. An elaborate picture of Bhadrakali is normally made. The singing of the songs take place after the Kalamezhuthu is finished in front of it and may last up to three hours. For the dance a male member dresses up as Bhadrakali, a creation of Shiva. In the performance she is just back from killing Darika and is telling the events to Shiva who is symbolised by the lighted lamp. As she was affected by small pox and has pockmarks on her face she has her back to the lamp almost throughout the performance.\n\nShree Bhadra Kalasamajam, Kottayam made some efforts to revive and reform the art.As it is being as a ritualistic art form and has strict traditional rituals which are strictly followed even now,Theeyattu cannot be modified at one's will.\n\nAyyappan Thiyyattu is a temple art performed by the Thiyyadi Nambiar community, a minuscule ambalavasi community living (basically) in three central Kerala districts of Thrissur, Palakkad and Malappuram. The all-male art centres around the mythological story of the birth of Lord Ayyappa from the relationship of Lord Vishnu in his ephemeral impersonation as Mohini and Lord Shiva.\n\nThe most common version of Thiyyattu involves four phases of presentation: a) Kalamezhuthu (sketching the kalam—picture—of Ayyappa using natural pigments), b) Kottum Pattum (rendition of invocatory songs of Ayyappa and a stylised narration of the story of his birth), c) Koothu gesture-laden dance enacting the build-up story to the delivery of the lord) and d) Velichchappaadu (the slow-paced to frenzied dance of the oracle who eventually erases the kalam—the image of the lord sketched on the sanctified floor). It takes roughly a couple of hours for the kalam (image) of the lord to be completed, after which the rest of the three rituals would consume nearly three hours altogether.\n\nThe picture of Ayyappa is sketched and embellished in five natural colours—white (rice powder), yellow (turmeric powder), green (ground semi-dry leaves of the 'vaaka' or manchadi' tree, red (a mix of turmeric powder and slaked lime) and black (powdered charred rice husk). The lord invariably holds his weapons like the sword and the bow-and-arrow, and, in more elaborate versions is sketched mounted on the tiger or the horse.\n\nThe songs—accompanied by the beats of 'para', a smaller version of the chenda, and the cymbals called ilathalam—praising the lord bear a mix of quaint old Malayalam and Tamil with a streak of endemic tunes, some of which can be traced to classical ragas of the Sopanam style of Kerala music besides that belonging to the Carnatic idiom. The stylised rendition of the birth of Ayyappa, called Thottam, also sticks to the same mix of languages, but is devoid of music.\n\nThe Koothu is enacted with no make-up but a defined set of costumes. Facial emotions are nil, dance movements are minimal and hand gestures would look the less refined versions of Koodiyattam and Kathakali. The Koothu is usually performed to the accompaniment of chenda, ilathalam and 'para'.\n\nThe Velichchappadu (oracle), wielding a small sword, is bare-chested but for the garland and, canonically, with a flowy hair; the face either bearded or clean-shaven. Around the waist, he is draped in cloth pieces of white and red colours. The oracle begins with slow steps while circumambulating around the 'kalam', but the tempo gains with the circles he make—around 9 or 11 of them, overall. Then he leaps onto the image in a frenzy, but is calm when he later erases the image with both legs. The face of the lord alone is erased with the (right) hand. Out from the 'kalam', the oracle utters 'revelatory' sentences in (presumed) trance -- 'kalpana' as they are called. The devotees are distributed with the prasadam which is the mixed powder used in the 'kalam'.\n\nThe art is sometimes staged in bigger forms that last from dawn to late night when it is called Udayasthamaya Thiyyattu. In such cases, the Koothu would deal with twelve stories ahead of the birth of Ayyappa. Such performances usually feature the challenging 'Pantheeraayiram', which is when the oracle would take a (three- to four-hour-long) break from the circumambulations to break (dehusked and sufficiently polished) coconuts totalling 12,000 to the rhythmic beats of chenda-and-ilathalam concert that would gain speed towards the climax.\n\nThe Thiyyadi Nambiar families, despite their existence in central Kerala, enjoy the popularity of their art more in the upstate Malabar belt. Some experts/historians trace this pattern to the community's possible southward flee from their original north Malabar homes during the controversial temple destruction spree of the 18th-century Mysore king Tippu Sultan.Mulankunnathukavu Thiyyaadi Raman Nambiar, in his book \"Ayyappan Theeyattu\" gives a lively narration of the traditional art and acknowledges the support from V. R.

The game was intended to be a competitor to \"Counter-Strike\", which served as the main inspiration for the game. Unlike \"Counter Strike\", \"Team Factor\" features a single-player and a third side.\n\nThe game had been in development since 2000. The team consisted of 9 to 14 developers. The development was financed by software company I.C.C.C. to which 7FX belonged. 7FX used its own engine LightForce. The original release date was mid-2001 but in the end it was released in May 2002. The game was published by Xicat Interactive as \"U.S. Special Forces: Team Factor\", instead of the original name, \"Team Factor\".\n\nThe game has similar gameplay to \"Counter-Strike\". It features 22 maps with different tasks for each side. There are three sides to play - US Special Forces, Russian Spetznaz and Terrorists. The single-player mode is the same but units are controlled by Bots.\n\nThe game has received generally unfavorable reviews. It currently holds a 44% on Metacritic and 46.5% on GameRankings. It was criticised for its gameplay, graphics and AI behavior.\n"}

The hall of fame started in 2004 with the induction of five founder members and five more members selected by a public televote, two from each of the last five decades. In subsequent years, a panel of more than 60 journalists and music industry executives decided the people and groups to be inducted. The ceremony was last held in 2006, and has since been cancelled.\n\nThere were five founding members, one from each decade from the 1950s to 1990s:\n\nIn addition, the public were asked to select one further act from each decade, from five lists of ten nominees. The five members chosen by the public in October 2004 were:\n\nThe full list of nominees were:\n\n\nChris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records, was awarded honorary membership.\n\nThe 2005 inductees were selected by a panel of 60 people from the music industry:\n\nThe late DJ John Peel was also made an honorary member (inducted by Damon Albarn of Blur).\n\nThe programme was televised in the UK. It was later shown on VH1 in the United States, without the Joy Division/New Order segments. The full version was subsequently shown on VH1 Classic.\n\nThe 2006 inductees were:\n\nGeorge Martin received an honorary membership (inducted by the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer and future Prime Minister Gordon Brown). He then went on to conduct a special arrangement of The Beatles songs \"Golden Slumbers\" / \"Carry That Weight\" / \"The End\"; with the help of Johnny Borrell, Corinne Bailey Rae, José González, Roger Taylor and the London Community Gospel Choir. The band were also joined by Dean Tidey.\n\nAlso present at the ceremony were Patti LaBelle (performed \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\"), Nona Hendryx, Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath), Wolfmother, Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), Mark Hudson, Lemar, Trevor Nelson, Trevor Francis, Giles Martin, Dermot O'Leary (host), and Paul Gambaccini.\n\nPrince, during his induction, invited everyone over to see him live in Las Vegas but gave an apology that he could not perform live at the venue. Rod Stewart appeared live by satellite from Los Angeles in a Celtic shirt and accidentally dropped his award, before advising James Morrison to 'give up the fags'.\n\nThe event has particular significance as it turned out to be James Brown's final televised recording, as he died on 25 December 2006.\n\nThe 2006 Induction Ceremony took place on 14 November 2006 at Alexandra Palace, and it was broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on 16 November, repeated on 18 November. It was shown on VH1 in the USA on 25 November.\n\nThere were no inductees in 2007. It was announced in September 2008 that Channel 4 had axed the ceremony, partly due to lack of funding, and also because a two-year gap since the last show was \"too long\".\n"}
{"id": "1684701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1684701", "title": "University Interscholastic League", "text": "University Interscholastic League\n\nThe University Interscholastic League (UIL) is an organization that creates rules for and administers almost all athletic, musical, and academic contests for public primary and secondary schools in the American state of Texas. It is the largest organization of its type in the world.\n\nActivities range from American football and cross-examination debate to mathematics and marching band competitions; however, the UIL does not administer Academic Decathlon competitions.\n\nThe UIL is under the governance of the Vice President for Diversity and Community Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin in Austin, Texas. Although the Texas Education Agency governs the activities of schools and school districts in Texas, the UIL does not report to TEA, but is instead a separate entity.\n\nThe UIL was originally created by the University of Texas at Austin in 1910 as two different entities, the Debating League of Texas High Schools (to govern debating contests) and the Interscholastic Athletic Association (to govern athletic contests). The two entities merged in 1913 and adopted the UIL name.\n\nAt the time, UIL only governed white schools in Texas. From 1940 to 1970, an era of racial segregation in Texas, the Prairie View Interscholastic League (PVIL), headquartered at Prairie View A&M University, served as a separate parallel organization for African-American public high schools in Texas.\n\nIn 1965, the UIL agreed to admit PVIL member schools for competition. Black schools began UIL competitions beginning in the 1967-68 school year. After the 1969–70 school year, the UIL fully absorbed all PVIL member schools, the majority of which would later be merged with their white counterparts.\n\nBeginning with the 2003–2004 academic year, two large all-male private schools, Dallas Jesuit and Houston Strake Jesuit, were granted UIL membership. This came after extensive court battles and negotiations from both the UIL's lawyers and the schools' joint lawyers. Previously, both schools were members of the now-defunct Texas Christian Interscholastic League (TCIL); after that league's demise and their inability to gain admittance into the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools (TAPPS) or Southwest Preparatory Conference (SPC), they decided to further pursue their decade-long battle of gaining membership into the UIL. They are so far the only private schools to be granted UIL membership, as the new UIL rules established after the Jesuit schools' entry prohibited those schools who were eligible for memberships in other similar associations (such as TAPPS or the SPC) to apply. \n\nThe Texas Legislature rewrote titles 1 and 2 of the Texas Education Code and greatly restricted the functions to be performed by the Texas Education Agency and the UIL. The changes made Texas an equal access state. The law now requires the public schools to allow all students that reside within the school's boundary equal access to all activities. The Senate also made amendments that expressly regulate the UIL and invalidated certain UIL rules limiting student eligibility for competitions by providing that UIL rules would only apply to a student enrolled in the public school. The UIL no longer has the authority to determine the eligibility of Charter/Home/Private school students. \n\nAll students must abide by the state No-Pass No-Play law. Only students that are enrolled in a public school must abide by UIL eligibility rules, even if the activity is not a UIL event.\n\nIn 1918, UIL excluded Private schools from membership after participation decreased significantly. Up to this time, private schools had competed in a separate Academy division from public schools. In 2003, rules were changed to allow some private or parochial schools to participate under certain circumstances when no other league is available to them. Other than this, membership in UIL is currently restricted to public schools and open-enrollment charter schools.\n\nOn October 10, 2010, the Third District Court of Appeals in Austin ruled that the UIL operates as a public organization and not a private organization. The ruling clarified that the UIL is legally considered a state agency and must comply with the prerequisites and duties that all other state agencies have. As a state agent the UIL must treat individuals equally and show the purpose/need as well as a rational basis for eligibility restrictions.\n\nThe UIL governs only public schools and 2 private high schools. Activities for most Texas private schools are governed by separate bodies, the largest of which is TAPPS. However, private schools are allowed to join the UIL only if 1) they meet UIL's definition of a high school, 2) they are accredited by the Texas Private School Accreditation Commission, and 3) they are ineligible for membership in any league similar to UIL (such as TAPPS or the Southwest Preparatory Conference). Furthermore, private schools must compete at one classification higher than their enrollment would otherwise dictate.\n\nCharter schools must participate at no lower than the classification of the smallest high school in the district where the charter school resides; for example, a charter school within the Dallas ISD must participate in at least Class AAAA, as DISD has high schools which participate at this level.\n\nUIL schools are permitted to schedule contests with private schools and/or home school groups.\n\nSchools are arranged by conference to ensure that schools compete on a regular basis with other schools in the geographic area of a similar size. The conferences are A (the smallest), AA, AAA, AAAA, AAAAA and AAAAAA (the largest). The corresponding alphanumeric designations (1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A) are used in everyday conversation (as well as in this article), but officially UIL only uses the alphabetic designations. The general guideline is that the UIL desires between 220 and 245 schools in Conference AAAAAA, at least 200 schools in Conferences AA, AAA, AAAA, and AAAAA with the grades 9–12 enrollment ratio for those classes no greater than 2.0 between the largest and smallest school in each class.\n\nIn addition, for football participation, a school whose enrollment is at or below 104.5 students may choose to play either six-man football (which, as of the 2014 alignment, is Conference 1A) or 11-man football (at Conference 2A). Schools with enrollments over 104.5 are only eligible for 11-man football; however, some schools organize a six-man team and play an \"outlaw\" schedule (i.e., the school is not eligible for the postseason). Moreover, for some events (such as team tennis or swimming and diving), the UIL organizes all participating schools into Conference 6A and Conference 5A, with the latter encompassing all schools not meeting the Conference 6A enrollment requirements.\n\nWithin each conference, the UIL separates the schools in regions, and then further separates the regions into districts for various contests. The districts are numbered from 1 (in far west Texas) to 32 (in south Texas). There are always 32 districts in Conference 6A and Conference 5A, but the smaller conferences may have numbers skipped based on the number of schools in the conference. No more than 10 schools are permitted in a single district unless all schools and the UIL consent otherwise; the preference is for an even number of schools in each district (6, 8, 10) though in some cases travel issues may prevent such.\n\nPreviously, schools were permitted to request to be placed in a higher conference than their enrollment would otherwise dictate, usually to play at a higher level of competition. The \"play up\" rule was later eliminated for competition reasons, but has been retained for geographic reasons (where playing at the current level would create a travel hardship for the school), and where school districts with eight or more high schools could keep all or most of them in the same conference. However, the school must then participate at the higher conference in \"all\" UIL events in which it does participate.\n\nEach type of contest has different regions and competitors, as there is no requirement that a school participate in all UIL events – some small rural schools do not participate in football or choose six-man over 11-man, while some magnet schools do not field athletic teams but participate in academic events only.\n\nUnlike the college ranks or other states, the regions and districts are not permanently set, but are redrawn biennially by the UIL behind closed doors in an attempt to keep schools of similar sizes within a certain distance of their geographic area when attending competitions, and to adjust for the changing enrollments of schools (moving schools with increased attendance up in conference and those with decreased attendance down) and new schools opening. The main redrawing of regions and districts takes place on February 1 of even-numbered years (and the final allocation, especially relating to high school football, is the subject of much pre-announcement anticipation and speculation as to which schools move up or down and the final composition of the districts), but as new schools open or smaller schools close or disband programs, interim adjustments can be made.\n\nThe changing districts and regions have produced unusual results – for example, the 2008-09 Conference 5A boys' basketball championship featured champion DeSoto from Region II defeating Cedar Hill from Region I, notwithstanding that the schools are in neighboring districts.\n\nIn Conference 6A, the top four teams from each district are eligible for the playoffs. The two eligible teams with the highest student enrollment for its district are seeded in the Division I playoff bracket, and the remaining two teams (with the lower enrollment) are seeded in the Division II playoff bracket. This method is supposed to prevent matchups between large and small schools within a classification, although in practice this is not always the case – for example, in the 2006 playoffs, Southlake Carroll (the Conference 5A Division I champion) had a lower student enrollment than Cedar Hill (the Conference 5A Division II champion).\n\nFor all other 11-man conferences and for six-man football, the UIL divides schools into separate Division I (large) and Division II (small) districts at its bi-annual redistricting session (in these cases, there are a maximum of 16 districts statewide, as opposed to the 32 in the larger conferences); separate playoffs are held for each division with the top four teams (top two in six-man) from each district eligible.\n\nIn Conferences 6A and 5A, the top four teams from each district are eligible. However, the UIL does not use a Division I/Division II alignment as in football; only one champion is crowned in each conference. A similar arrangement exists in Conferences 2A-4A, and for Conference 1A in all other team sports except basketball, only the top three teams are eligible.\n\nFor Conference 1A basketball, similar to the six-man football setup the UIL divides schools into separate Division I (large) and Division II (small) districts prior to the beginning of the season, and separate playoffs are held for each division with the top two teams from each district eligible. This arrangement exists because, in some small schools, basketball is the only team sport in which the school participates.\n\nFor baseball and softball, at all levels except the state tournament, playoff rounds are best 2-of-3 only if both coaches agree; if they do not then the coaches flip a coin to decide the format of the playoff (single game or two out of three series). At the state tournament both the semifinals and finals are single-game format.\n\nAdvancement in these activities is dependent on the individual event involved.\n\nIn musical competitions, schools are aligned into 33 regions (the regions themselves are set not by the UIL, but by the Texas Music Educators Association). Schools of all sizes are grouped into a region.\n\nAdvancement within musical competition is not based on direct competition against other schools. Instead, musicians are compared against an established rubric (this is comparable to conformation dog shows where dogs compete against the written standard for their breed, not against other dogs of differing breeds), and all schools or individuals who are judged \"Division 1\" (the highest level) advance to the next level, except for state competition.\n\nFor marching band, schools compete against other schools in the same UIL conference. The 33 regions are grouped into nine areas (named A-I) for Conferences 5A and 6A, and five areas (A-E) for Conference 4A and down. All schools of all conferences compete in region competition annually, as a fall semester activity. However, in even-numbered years schools in Conferences 2A, 4A, and 6A can advance from region to area and state, and in odd-numbered years schools from Conferences 3A and 5A can advance from region to area and state, in addition to schools in Conference 1A may advance from region to state (There are no Area contests for Conference 1A, only for 2A and up). In order for bands to advance from Region to Area, they need to get an overall Division 1 from at least two Region judges, whether it be a 1-2-1, 2-1-1, 1-1-2, etc... the bands then will advance to the Area Competition. In order to make State, the band needs to make it to the Area Final competition AND make it to the top 3-5 bands to get to State. The Area and State winner is the school with the lowest ordinal score when the rankings from each judge are tabulated. For example, School 1 receives a first place score from three judges, a second place score from the fourth judge, and a fourth place score from the fifth judge. The ordinal score for School 1 is 9 (1+1+1+2+4). School 2 receives two first place scores and three second place scores. The ordinal score for School 2 is 8 (2+2+2+1+1). School 2 would be the champion despite receiving fewer first place scores because School 2's ordinal score is lower than School 1's. Thus, overall placement in the caption area for each judge is more important than the raw score awarded by the judge.\n\nIn all other musical competitions (held in the spring semester), conference alignments are disregarded except for the rules regarding sight reading. Advancement in solo and small ensemble competition is from region to state, and at state the top two soloists and top ensemble are awarded medals. Individual performers may be given Outstanding Performer awards. However, advancement is limited not only to Division 1 winners, but the winners must have performed \"Class 1\" (difficult level) performances at region, and the performance must have been from a selection on the UIL's \"Prescribed Music List\" and also performed from memory (except for certain instrumental pieces which are designated as exempt from such on the List). In sight reading, schools in different conferences read different pieces, and second groups (officially called \"non-varsity\" groups) read different pieces from other conferences than the varsity group.\n\nSight Reading and medium ensembles compete at region level only. Music theory is held at state only and is open to any and all students in grades 9–12 having the permission of the school principal and school music director; the student is not required to have advanced from region in another musical contest (or even participated for that matter). Wind ensembles can advance from region to state; however, the state event is not a competition but an educational event.\n\nHistorically, football championship games have been held at neutral sites mutually agreed upon by both teams, but in 2006, 2007 and 2009, both CConference 5A championship games were played at the Alamodome in San Antonio. Frequent sites for those games included the Astrodome in Houston, Texas Stadium in Irving, Alamo Stadium in San Antonio and Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin.\n\nIn 2010, the UIL designated sites for all championship games: the 5A, 4A, and 3A championships were held at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, while the 2A and 1A championships were held at Newsom Stadium in Mansfield and the six-man championships at Shotwell Stadium in Abilene. In 2011, Conferences 1A-5A played their state championships at AT&T Stadium, while the six-man games were played at Abilene. In 2013, the six-man games moved to AT&T Stadium as well. In 2015 the 11-man championships were played at NRG Stadium in Houston due to a conflict with a Dallas Cowboys-New York Jets game, while the six-man title games returned to Shotwell. All championship games are scheduled to return to AT&T Stadium in 2016.\n\nThe state semifinal and championship games for all five classes in boys and girls basketball are held at the Frank Erwin Center on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin. In 2015 it was decided to move the Boys & Girls state tournaments to the Alamodome in San Antonio,TX, due to ongoing price and venue disputes in Austin. The state track and field meet and swimming championships are also held on the UT Austin campus, the former at Mike A. Myers Stadium and the latter at the Lee and Joe Jamail Texas Swimming Center.\n\nThe soccer semifinals and finals for 4A and 5A are held at Birkelbach Field in the Austin suburb of Georgetown, and the state baseball tournament is held at Dell Diamond in another Austin suburb, Round Rock. The state softball tournament is held at Red and Charline McCombs Field on the UT Austin campus. The state cross country meet is held at Old Settlers Park in Round Rock. The state wrestling tournament is held at the DELCO Center in Austin. The Conference 5A state golf tournament is held at Jimmy Clay Golf Course, a municipal course in Austin.\n\nFrom 2000–2011 the girls' volleyball tournament was held in Strahan Coliseum on the campus of Texas State University in San Marcos. Since 2012, the tournament has been held at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland.\n\nThough UIL is best known as the governing body for public school athletic competition, it also hosts numerous academic competitions as well. Between athletics, music, and academics, UIL estimates that half of all public high school graduates have competed in at least one UIL-sanctioned event during their high school tenure.\n\nThe state level academic competitions are held on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin. The speech and debate finals are often held in the State Capitol Building.\n\nFor fine arts and journalism contests, the UIL has not adopted an \"amateur rule.” Thus, students who have acted or performed professionally or who have written for a local newspaper may still compete in UIL-sanctioned contests provided they are otherwise eligible.\n\nIn the 2016-17 season, the University Interscholastic League featured 834,558 participants, with 59% boys and 41% girls.\n\nThe sports with most boys are:\n\nThe sports with most girls are:\n\nAny student who competes at a state academic meet (at any high school grade) is also eligible to apply for a scholarship from the Texas Interscholastic League Foundation, an affiliate of UIL. The student must attend college in Texas full-time and meet certain grade requirements.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34321513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34321513", "title": "Wilfredo (character)", "text": "Wilfredo (character)\n\nWilfredo is a fictional comedy character portrayed by the British comedian Matt Roper.\n\nThe character is an obnoxious, deluded and uncouth satire of a romantic singer characterized in a commedia dell'arte style. Wilfredo has acquired a cult status, particularly among music festival audiences and on the alternative cabaret and comedy circuit in London. Roper has toured the character internationally, performing in Spain, Italy, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, South Africa, Australia and Argentina.\n\nPhysically, the character of Wilfredo is a grotesque caricature of Falstaffian appearance: trousers pulled up to the top of a corpulent stomach, a tight flamenco shirt, a wild black mop wig and a set of prominent prosthetic teeth. Typically, the character will always hold a pint of beer on stage, even whilst dancing and singing. He smokes his way throughout songs, salivating over the audience and musicians while berating them with rich expletives. Critics have described the character as \"a wonderful and vile creation\", \"strangely endearing\", \"joyful and grin-inducing\", and \"utterly charming and uplifting\".\n\nThe character began his life onstage performing cover versions of songs by Leonard Cohen, Phil Spector, Amy Winehouse and the Rolling Stones. In an interview with the student media, Roper stated: \"My father was a trad comic so I grew up around a lot of the old school; people like Frankie Howerd and lots of music hall acts. I’d be taken to theatres and all these smoky clubs where there was always a mad speciality artist or a singer in a spangly outfit or a dinner suit onstage, crooning covers. Wilfredo comes from that world for sure.\" Elsewhere in the same interview, Roper said he hoped Wilfredo \"offers escape\".\n\nRoper has constructed an entire life history and family background to Wilfredo and updates audiences through his performance. The character hails from Granada in Spain, the fourth son of a fourth son, a gifted child prodigy who evolved into a national singing star. The character is always accompanied by a guitarist onstage, often by Katie Pollak in the role of Mana Maria, the younger sister of Wilfredo. The character of Maria wears identical teeth and hair, although and bespectacled. She is the polar opposite of Wilfredo: where Wilfredo is brash and loud, Maria in contrast is totally mute and performed in a subtle style. On occasion (as at the 2011 Edinburgh Festival) Kris Howe may accompany – also in character – as Wilfredo's 'Uncle' Ignacio.\nWilfredo's life story is juxtaposed with real life historical events into which Wilfredo is fictionally placed: an appearance at the Benidorm International Song Contest Festival for example is claimed, as is a friendship and a near collaboration with Serge Gainsbourg. Throughout his performances Wilfredo introduces songs from a fictional back catalogue of bestselling albums, with titles ranging from El Chico En El Toro (the Boy on the Bull) to Solo Para Las Damas (Only For The Ladies).\n\nThe boorish and outlandish Wilfredo is delusional, believing himself to be the apotheosis of masculinity and all that is attractive to women. This arrogance is counterbalanced by a charm which in turn endears him to audiences. The origin of the name lies in Latin America, meaning 'to desire peace'.\n\nRoper first performed the character in 2008 at a benefit in Totnes, Devon before performing at the Glastonbury Festival weeks later. In August he performed at the Maker Sunshine Festival in Cornwall with a full band, before guesting with Barcelona-based gypsy jazz combo Gadjo. The character made his London debut at Camden Town's Lockstock Festival in November 2008, performing a cover of the Amy Winehouse song Rehab. Encouraged by the positive reception of these appearances, Roper began to perform Wilfredo sporadically until the summer of 2009 while writing and exploring the concept of the character more fully. Another Glastonbury Festival appearance followed, as did performances at the Winchester Hat Fair. In September 2009 Wilfredo began to establish himself by way of guest performances on the London comedy circuit. In March 2010 Wilfredo was placed alongside the Penny Dreadfuls and Angelos Epithemiou in Pippa Evans \"Old Time New Time Music Hall\" at the Canal Café Theatre, performing parodies and original song.\n\nRoper presented a sixty-minute show \"Wilfredo: A Man and His Music\" at the Etcetera Theatre in April 2010. Featuring the character Mana Maria on guitar, Wilfredo performed covers (Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah), parody (Those Were The Days) and original songs from a fictionalized back catalogue of albums. Various affairs with prominent women including Victoria Beckham, American First Lady Michelle Obama and the Princess of Wales are claimed for the first time in The Child Is Not Mine, which becomes a flagship signature song. A journalist on the Camden New Journal described \"initial terror\" at the character, later adding \"I left unscathed, having spent the evening roaring with laughter.\" Roper then presented the show for the Brighton Festival Fringe at the Komedia, before performing the character in Lecce, Italy for the Factory K-NOS artist collective.\n\nIn July 2010 Wilfredo became the surprise breakthrough act at the Port Eliot Festival in Cornwall, performing two outdoor sets with Mana Maria before hosting the main stage, where he introduced Jarvis Cocker and Talvin Singh to the festival audience. Increasingly satirizing the cult of celebrity, Wilfredo was also filmed chatting to Biba founder, the fashion designer Barbara Hulanicki, giving the impression to onlookers that she was his own personal designer. The following year Wilfredo once again hosted, appearing onstage with John Cooper Clarke, Louis Eliot and Bellowhead.\n\nIn August 2010 the character returned to Italy for an appearance at the Salento Summer Festival.\n\nFrom 10 June – 7 July 2013 Wilfredo appeared at the Cape Town Comedy Festival at the Baxter Theatre. On 12 July the character performed at the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation comedy gala in the presence of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. On 25 June Wilfredo appeared on the \"Expresso\" show, aired nationally on the South African SABC network.\n\nIn March 2011 Wilfredo enjoyed a limited season at the Leicester Square Theatre where he began to preview new material for the forthcoming Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The writer Joanna Lloyd described him as \"the bastard love child of Les Patterson and Julio Iglesias.\" The show – a retrospective journey of his life and times told for the first time entirely in original song – eventually became \"Wilfredo: Erecto!\". Further previews were later staged to small audiences at the Canal Cafe Theatre. In addition, on 16 June Roper presented the character to an audience at the Poetry Society in Covent Garden, reciting a spoken-word version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye'.\n\nAn appearance in the first series of Rufus Hound's \"What's So Funny?\" for BBC Radio 7 (now BBC Radio 4 Extra) was enough to initiate further interest in the character from radio audiences, while an appearance at the E4 Udderbelly for Arthur Smith's \"Pissed Up Chat Show\" (sold to audiences as the only show where the host is sober but all his guests are drunk) followed successfully in July 2011.\n\n\"Wilfredo: Erecto!\" was performed nightly at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 4–28 August 2011 at the Underbelly, drawing good houses and a positive commentary in the British press. Isy Suttie, writing in \"The Guardian\" newspaper, described the show as \"weird, intimate and wonderful\" while What's On Stage observed \"Wilfredo sees himself as a kind of Messiah figure, born to sing, write poetry, and seduce an endless succession of women.\" The British comedy industry website Chortle noted the character as \"sometimes cantankerous, often lecherous and almost certainly consumptive... coughing and burping his way through the set, at one point hacking up phlegm like a horse chewing a toffee\" while the critic at \"ThreeWeeks\" lauded Wilfredo as both \"disgusting and arousing\". The \"Erotic Review\" found the character \"a lewd yet loveable Latino\" and \"Time Out\" \"an extraordinary creation\". From others, Roper found himself tipped as a Steve Coogan for the next generation, while \"The List\" found Wilfredo simply \"unlikeable\".\n\nIn June 2011 the first of five editions of \"Wilfredo... and Other Beautiful Creatures\" was staged at the Phoenix Artist Club in Soho. Headed by Wilfredo and featuring a variety of musical and comic guests, the show took place each month in the basement club. Guests included the Pajama Men, Isy Suttie, Barry from Watford, Loretta Maine, Lewis Schaffer and Lenny Beige.\n\nOn 25 December 2011, Wilfredo recorded the Christmas Day edition of \"The Comedy Club\" for BBC Radio 4 Extra.\n\nIn February 2012 the first performance of \"The Wonderful World of Wilfredo\" was presented at London's BAC, programmed for the N20 Comedy Festival. In April Wilfredo guested at the Camden Roundhouse for a short season in performances curated by Scottee for CircusFest 2012. On 6 July Wilfredo performed in \"Arthur Smith's Benefit For The Royal Yacht\" at the E4 Udderbelly at the Southbank Centre, an alternative Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert.\n\n\"The Wonderful World of Wilfredo\" was a sixty-minute performance during which Wilfredo elaborated on his friendship with Serge Gainsbourg and boasted of affairs with both the actress Angelina Jolie and the British politician Harriet Harman. Reviewed by the festival press as \"seductive\", \"physically repellent but charming\" and \"quite inappropriate\", it was performed nightly at the 2012 Edinburgh Festival Fringe at Just the Tonic from 2 to 26 August after previewing in Manchester. In Manchester he guested on Beatwolf Radio, interviewed by Vic McGlynn and performing a live performance of 'Lady Holiday', during which Mike Joyce, former drummer of iconic Manchester band the Smiths, played percussion. In Edinburgh the show gained positive press reviews. \"The Skinny\" hailed the show as \"a strange blend of obnoxious, almost Sadowitzian humour and exquisitely beautiful music.\" Time Out magazine noted \"Roper inhabits his creation deeply, undercutting his hauteur and self-delusion with beams of charm and dollops of soul\". A studio soundtrack of the show has since been recorded and released for download.\n\nJuly 12, 2013 saw the first screening of the documentary short \"Wilfredo Comes To Town\" at London's Leicester Square Theatre in an evening billed as \"Wilfredo on Stage/Wilfredo on Screen: A Celebration\". Shooting over the winter of 2011/2 on the streets of London and at Abbey Road Studios, it was an attempt to move the character from the stage to the screen. The film-maker Mat Snead has said of the film: \"I think what I wanted to do was to try and take Wilfredo off stage and almost push the absurdity of it by showing him in a real world environment. Wilfredo really does exist on stage, so what I was trying to do was get him off stage and get him into some different environments and do some things that you can’t do on stage. I’ve seen a lot of those kinds of acts, but there are very few that can actually pull it off.\"\n\nFollowing a short Central European tour of Budapest, Brno, Bratislava and Hradec Králové, \"Wilfredo: Deconstructed\" opened at the Edinburgh Festival 31 July to August 24, 2014, drawing good reviews in the festival press. The Scottish magazine The Skinny noted the performance as \"a cabaret performance much closer to the real thing than you might have believed possible on arrival. For all the Spanish crooner parody (which could so easily descend into dated, 2D 'funny foreigner' stuff) the joke is perhaps on us\" while Kate Copstick of the Scotsman newspaper hailed the character as \"a master of seduction\" and the music \"timeless\". Such criticism was later lost on BBC Radio 2, who banned Peace All Over The World (At Christmas Time) – a festive single release by the character in a duet with the comedian Pippa Evans under the guise of Latino star Carmella – on the basis of \"daytime listeners being offended\".\n\nWilfredo embarked on a Spring tour of the Asia-Pacific region in 2015, having opened at the Adelaide Fringe on March 1 and giving performances in Manila, the Philippines, Singapore and at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.\n\nOn July 6, Wilfredo Unchained: Live in California was released worldwide as a download-only concert album, originally recorded in Petaluma, California in April 2014.\n\nPresently Wilfredo makes regular weekend appearances at the Slipper Room, a vaudeville and variety theatre in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City. According to a piece by the British comedy blogger John Fleming published in December 2015, Wilfredo will appear in a feature film entitled \"The Mel and Fanny Movie\", directed by James Habacker. Shooting is to begin in New York City early 2016.\n\n"}
