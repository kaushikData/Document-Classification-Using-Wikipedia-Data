{"id": "5890552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5890552", "title": "Barre (ballet)", "text": "Barre (ballet)\n\nA barre () is a stationary handrail that provides support for people during various types of exercise. Barres are used extensively in ballet training and warm up exercises, where such exercises are commonly referred to as \"barre work\". In a ballet class, barre may also refer to the part of the class that involves barre work. Barres are also used for warm up exercises in other types of dance, as well as in general fitness programs.\n\nThe design of a barre—which includes both the handrail and its support mechanism—depends on whether the barre is to be portable or permanently located. A permanent barre typically consists of a handrail that is mounted to and supported by a wall, whereas a portable barre consists of a handrail mounted onto a rigid or adjustable, free-standing supporting structure. Some barres have two parallel handrails at different heights to accommodate people of differing heights. Barre handrails and supports are typically made of metal, wood, plastic, or a combination of these materials.\n\nIn ballet, barre work includes both slow and fast exercises, which both serve to strengthen muscles. Slow exercises are typically performed first, to stretch and warm up muscles, and to focus on proper body form, whereas fast exercises condition dancers to maintain precise ballet technique while moving. Each exercise has a specific purpose, such as to strengthen feet and legs, increase extension, improve flexibility, and develop ballon. Proper form (posture, positions of feet and arms) is strived for in all exercises.\n\nA barre helps dancers by providing a means of stability and balance and, consequently, barre work often comprises a significant portion of the beginning dancer's class. It is an essential tool when first learning foot placement technique, and also for beginning pointe dancers, who have not yet developed the strength and technique needed for pointe work. The barre continues to be an important tool in all levels of ballet. Barre work helps dancers prepare for partnering, with the barre simulating the support of a real partner.\n\nWhen used for promoting general fitness, barre exercises may incorporate a wide variety of activities to increase stamina, flexibility and strength, including ballet movements that require balance and stimulate the core such as pliés and pirouettes.\n\nBarre classes have become a popularized form of exercise. A barre class includes the use of the barre as a tool for repetitions of small, pulsing movements with emphasis on form, alignment and core engagement. Devices such as yoga straps, exercise balls and hand weights are sometimes used during barre classes. Barre classes draw from yoga as well as dance and pilates and focus on breath and the mind-body connection.\n"}
{"id": "383364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=383364", "title": "Bassline", "text": "Bassline\n\nA bassline (also known as a bass line or bass part) is the term used in many styles of music, such as jazz, blues, funk, dub and electronic, traditional music, or classical music for the low-pitched instrumental part or line played (in jazz and some forms of popular music) by a rhythm section instrument such as the electric bass, double bass, cello, tuba or keyboard (piano, Hammond organ, electric organ, or synthesizer). In unaccompanied solo performance, basslines may simply be played in the lower register of any instrument such as guitar or piano while melody and/or further accompaniment is provided in the middle or upper register. In solo music for piano and pipe organ, these instruments have an excellent lower register that can be used to play a deep bassline. On organs, the bass line is typically played using the pedal keyboard and massive 16' and 32' bass pipes.\n\nBasslines in popular music often use \"riffs\" or \"grooves\", which are usually simple, appealing musical motifs or phrases that are repeated, with variation, throughout the song. \"The bass differs from other voices because of the particular role it plays in supporting and defining harmonic motion. It does so at levels ranging from immediate, chord-by-chord events to the larger harmonic organization of entire work.\" Bassline riffs usually emphasize the chord tones of each chord (usually the root note, the third note, or the fifth note), which helps to define a song's key. At the same time, basslines work along with the drum part and the other rhythm instruments to create a clear rhythmic pulse.\n\nThe type of rhythmic pulse used in basslines varies widely in different types of music. In swing jazz and jump blues, basslines are often created from a continuous sequence of quarter notes in a mostly scalar, stepwise or arpeggio-based part called a \"walking bass line\". In Latin, salsa music, jazz fusion, reggae, electronica, and some types of rock and metal, basslines may be very rhythmically complex and syncopated. In bluegrass and traditional country music, basslines often emphasize the root and fifth of each chord. \n\nThough basslines may be played by many different types of instruments and in a broad musical range, they are generally played on bass instruments and in the range roughly at least an octave and a half below middle C (roughly the range of the bass clef). In classical music such as string quartets and symphonies, basslines play the same harmonic and rhythmic role; however, they are usually referred to as the \"bass voice\" or the \"bass part\".\n\nMost popular musical ensembles include an instrument capable of playing bass notes. In the 1890s, a tuba was often used. From the 1920s to the 1940s, most popular music groups used the double bass as the bass instrument. Starting in the 1950s, the bass guitar began to replace the double bass in most types of popular music, such as rock and roll, blues, and folk. The bass guitar was easier to transport and, given that it uses magnetic pickups, easier to amplify to loud stage volumes without the risk of audio feedback, a common problem with the amplified double bass. By the 1970s and 1980s, the electric bass was used in most rock bands and jazz fusion groups. The double bass was still used in some types of popular music that recreated styles from the 1940s and 1950s such as jazz (especially swing and bebop), traditional 1950s blues, jump blues, country, and rockabilly.\n\nIn some popular music bands, keyboard instruments are used to play the bass line. In organ trios, for example, a Hammond organ player performs the basslines using the organ's pedal keyboard. In some types of popular music, such as hip-hop or house music, the bass lines are played using bass synthesizers, sequencers, or electro-acoustically modeled samples of basslines.\nBasslines are important in many forms of dance and electronic music, such as electro, drum and bass, dubstep, and most forms of house and trance. In these genres, basslines are almost always performed on synthesizers, either physical, such as the Minimoog and the Roland TB-303, or virtual, such as Sytrus and ZynAddSubFX. In hip hop, producer Rick Rubin popularized the technique of creating basslines by lengthening the bass drum decay of the TR-808 drum machine and tuning it to different pitches.\n\nChinese orchestras use the zhōng ruǎn (中阮) and dà ruǎn (大阮) for creating basslines. Other, less common bass instruments are the lā ruǎn (拉阮), dī yīn gé hú (低音革胡), and da dī hú (大低胡) developed during the 1930s. Russian balalaika orchestra use bass balalaika and contrabass balalaika.\n\nAustralia's indigenous music and some World music that is influenced by Australian music uses didjeridus for basslines.\n\nIn classical music, the bassline is always written out for the performers in musical notation. In orchestral repertoire, the basslines are played by the double basses and cellos in the string section, by bassoons, contrabassoons, and bass clarinets in the woodwinds and by bass trombones, tubas and a variety of other low brass instruments. In symphonies from the Classical period, a single bassline was often written for the cellos and basses; however, since the bass is a transposing instrument, and it is notated an octave higher than it sounds, when cellos and basses play the same bassline, the line is performed in octaves, with the basses an octave below the cellos. By the end of the Classical period, with Beethoven's symphonies, cellos and double basses were often given separate parts. In general, the more complex passages and rapid note sequences are given to the cellos, while the basses play a simpler bassline. The timpani (or kettledrums) also play a role in orchestral basslines, albeit confined in 17th and early 18th century works to a few notes, often the tonic and the dominant below it. In a small number of symphonies, the pipe organ is used to play basslines.\n\nIn chamber music, the bassline is played by the cello in string quartets and the bassoon in wind chamber music. In some larger chamber music works, both a cello and a double bass are used to play the bassline. In a Baroque era (ca. 1600-1750) piece accompanied by basso continuo, the accompanying musicians would include a chordal instrument (e.g., harpsichord, pipe organ or lute) and a number of bass instruments might perform the same bassline, such as the cello, viol, double bass, theorbo, serpent (an early wind instrument), and, if an organist was present, the lower manual of the organ and the low-pitched pedal keyboard. In 2000s-era performances of Baroque music, the basso continuo is typically performed by just two instruments: a chordal instrument and one bass instrument (often harpsichord and cello).\n\nIn many genres of modern traditional music (ranging from folk rock to blues) and popular music (ranging from rock and pop to reggae to funk), the bassline is generally played by an electric bass player. In rockabilly, psychobilly, traditional blues and bluegrass music, the bassline is played by a double bass player. The bassline uses low notes that provide a rhythm while simultaneously setting out the foundation of the chord progression. The bassline bridges the gap between the rhythmic part played by the drummer and the melodic lines played by the lead guitarist and the chordal parts played by the rhythm guitarist and/or keyboard player. In most traditional and popular music styles, the bass player is expected to be able to improvise a bassline which they base in the chord progression of a song. When a bassist is playing a cover song, they may play the bassline that was originally used on the recording. A session bassist playing in a music studio is expected to be able to read a bassline written in musical notation. Bass players also perform fills in between the phrases of the vocal melody, and they may also perform bass runs or bass breaks, which are short solo sections. Rhythmic variations by the bass, such as the introduction of a syncopated figure can dramatically change the feel of a song, even for a simple groove.\n\n\"In any style, the bass's role in the groove is the same: to keep time and to outline the tonality. When developing bass lines, these two things should always be your goal\"\n\nA walking bass is a style of bass accompaniment or line, common in Baroque music (1600-1750) and 20th century jazz, blues and rockabilly, which creates a feeling of regular quarter note movement, akin to the regular alternation of feet while walking. Thus walking basslines generally consist of unsyncopated notes of equal value, usually quarter notes (known in jazz as a \"four feel\"). Walking basslines use a mixture of scale tones, arpeggios, chromatic runs, and passing tones to outline the chord progression of a song or tune, often with a melodic shape that alternately rises and falls in pitch over several bars. To add variety to a walking bassline, bassists periodically interpolate various fills, such as playing scale or arpeggio fragments in swung eighth notes, plucking muted percussive grace notes (either one grace note or a \"raked\" sequence of two or three grace notes), or holding notes for two, three, or four beats. Some songs lend themselves to another type of variation: the pedal point, in which the bassist holds or repeats a single note (often the tonic or the dominant) under the chord changes.\n\nWalking basslines are usually performed on the double bass or the electric bass, but they can also be performed using the low register of a piano, Hammond organ, tuba or other instruments. They can also be sung, as is done by some a capella vocal groups. While walking bass lines are most commonly associated with jazz and blues, they are also used in rock, rockabilly, ska, R&B, gospel, Latin, country, and many other genres.\n\nWalking bass in the pedal keyboard part of Baroque organ music (J.S. Bach's \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\", BWV 659, from the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes):\n\nOther walking bass lines can be heard in the opening movements of Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 22 (nicknamed \"The Philosopher\"), Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 5 and Edward Elgar's Symphony No. 1.\n\nWalking bass often alternates quarter notes:\n\n<score>\\relative c' \\repeat volta 2{ c g c g c g b a g d' g, d' g, d' e d}</score>\n\ngiving rise to the term.\n\nMany boogie-woogie basslines are walking bass lines:\n\nWalking bass often moves in stepwise (scalar) motion to successive chord roots, such as often in country music:\n\nIn this example, the last two quarter notes of the second measure, D and E, \"walk\" up from the first quarter note in that measure, C, to the first note of the third measure, F (C and F are the roots of the chords in the first through second and third through fourth measures, respectively).\n\nIn both cases, \"walking\" refers both to the steady duple rhythm (one step after the other) and to the strong directional motion created; in the examples above, from C to F and back in the second, and from root to seventh and back in the first.\n\nIn bebop jazz, the walking bass has a stabilising effect, offsetting and providing a foil to the complexity of the improvised melodic lines, for example in Sonny Rollins’ “Blue Seven”.\n\nA bass run (or \"bass break\") is a short instrumental break or fill in which the bass instrument (such as an electric bass or a double bass) or instruments (in the case of a marching band) and the bassline are given the forefront. The bass part for a bass run often differs from the usual bass accompaniment style, in terms of the register, timbre, or melodic style that is used, or the number of notes per beat which are played.\n\nA bass run may be composed by the performer or by an arranger prior to a performance, or it may be improvised onstage by the performer using scales, arpeggios, and standard licks and riffs. In some cases, a bass run may incorporate a display of virtuoso techniques such as rapid passages or high notes. During a bass run, the main vocal or melody line usually stops, and in some cases, the percussion or drums may also stop. The technique originated in the marches of the \"Sousa school\", though its resemblance to call and response techniques familiar to African American musicians indicates an earlier origin.\n\nIn a rock song in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the electric bass, a bass run may consist of a rapid sequence of sixteenth notes in a higher register, or of a melodic riff played in a higher register. In some cases, the bassist will select a \"brighter\"-sounding pickup or increase the treble response of the instrument for a bass run, so that it will be easier to hear.\n\nIn a heavy metal song where the bassist was ordinarily playing low notes without overdrive to accompany, for a solo, he or she may turn on a fuzz bass pedal and use a wah pedal to create a more pronounced tone (an approach used by Cliff Burton), and then play an upper register riff or scale run. Some shred guitar-style bassists may do two-handed tapping during a bass solo (e.g., Billy Sheehan).\n\nIn a pop song in which the bassline consists of notes plucked on the electric bass, a bass run may consist of several bars of percussive slapping and popping. Bass solos and guitar solos are rare in pop. In the rare cases that instrumental solos occur in pop, they are often played by synthesizer or, in some bands, by saxophone.\n\nIn a funk song in which the bassline already consists of percussive slapping and popping, a bass run may consist of a virtuostic display of rapid slapping and popping techniques combined with techniques such as glissando, note-bending, and harmonics.\n\nIn a jump blues tune in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the double bass in a scalar walking bass style, a bass run may consist of a bar of swung eighth notes played using a percussive slap bass style, in which the right hand strikes the strings against the fingerboard.\n\nIn a swing tune in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the double bass in a scalar walking bass style, a bass run may consist of a descending chromatic scale played in a higher register.\n\nIn a bluegrass tune in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the double bass on the root and fifth of each chord on beats one and three (of a 4/4 tune), a bass run may consist of a walking bass line played for several bars.\n\nIn a psychobilly band, a bass solo will often consist of a virtuostic display of triple and quadruple slaps, creating a percussive, drum solo-like sound.\n\nIn a marching band context, a bass run may consist of a several bar unaccompanied passage composed for the tubas and sousaphones which displays either rapid passages of notes or higher-register techniques. In New Orleans jazz, the tuba may provide a walking bass line similar to that of the double bass.\n\n\n\n"}

The series featured the Maximals and Predacons, descendants of the Autobots and Decepticons respectively, and was set in the future of the continuity; however, it was eventually revealed that they had traveled back in time before the series began and were actually on a prehistoric Earth some time in between when Optimus Prime and Megatron first crash-landed on Earth and the time when they awoke (as depicted in the first episode of ). Beast Wars was set up as a sequel to the first \"Transformers\" series (which has since been rebooted in limited comic book stories by Dreamwave and IDW among others).\n\nThe \"Beast Wars\" TV series was the first Transformers series to feature computer-animated characters, and was produced by Mainframe Entertainment (now known as Rainmaker Studios) of Canada, specifically Vancouver; its story editors were Bob Forward and Larry DiTillio. All three seasons are currently available on DVD in the USA and other Region 1 territories. In Australia, to coincide with the show's tenth anniversary in 2006, Madman Entertainment released all three seasons in Region 4 format. These boxsets include \"world exclusive\" special features, such as commentaries and interviews with the voice actors.\n\nThe production designer for the show, Clyde Klotz, won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation in 1997 for his work on \"Beast Wars.\"\n\nThe two main factions of \"Transformers\" in Beast Wars are descendants of the two main factions in the original cartoon: the Maximals are the descendants of the Autobots and the Predacons are the descendants of the Decepticons. (In the sequel series \"\", the process during which Autobots and Decepticons became Maximals and Predacons is referred to as \"The Great Upgrade.\")\n\nThe leader of the Predacon team is Megatron, a namesake of the original Decepticon commander. He and his forces are a splinter group on the hunt for powerful crystals known as Energon, though in \"The Agenda Part 1\" it's revealed Megatron got the location of energon as a bonus to be used in a ploy for power and dominance. They do this with the aid of an artifact known as the Golden Disk and Megatron's stolen ship, the \"Darksyde\", which is equipped with a transwarp drive. A Maximal exploration ship, the \"Axalon\", led by Optimus Primal, is sent to stop them. Together the ships plunge through a time/space phenomenon created by the transwarp device during their battle in space, and crash-land on a mysterious planet.\n\nThe planet is found to be rich in deposits of raw Energon, in such extreme amounts that it proves to be poisonous to both factions' robot forms, forcing them to take on alternate organic forms for protection until their robot forms are needed. Thus the robots take on the beast forms of recognizable animals including mammals, birds, dinosaurs, arachnids, and insects.\n\nBefore crashing, the \"Axalon\" deploys its cargo of \"stasis pods\" containing Maximal protoforms — Transformer robots with vulnerable and undeveloped physical forms, which are left to orbit the planet as an alternative to possible destruction in the initial crash landing. This plays a larger part in the IDW series, \"The Gathering\". Throughout the series, stasis pods lose altitude and crash-land on the planet, and the Maximals and Predacons race and fight to acquire them, as protoforms acquired by Megatron's forces can be reprogrammed to become Predacons. The stasis pods are used as a plot device to introduce new characters.\n\nThe teams are divided between the \"good\" Maximals and the \"evil\" Predacons, equivalent to the traditional Autobots and Decepticons. Most of the Maximals are based on mammals, while the Predacons are based on reptiles or insects. Dinobot changes sides, starting as a Predacon and becoming a Maximal, and was later created as an artificial Predacon clone by Megatron in season 3. This made Dinobot the only reptile-based Maximal, as he is based on a Utahraptor. Additionally certain \"Predacons\" like Inferno and Blackarachnia were created from Maximal protoforms, but were fitted with Predacon shell programs, fighting instead for the Predacons. For the Maximals, the emphasis is on team spirit and good-natured arguing, especially from Rattrap, but the Predacons argue and battle for leadership, which impairs their effectiveness against the Maximals.\n\n\nThere have been two \"Beast Wars\" video games. The first game, simply called \"\", was released for the PlayStation and PC. It was a third person shooter, based on the first season of the show, in which you can control either the Maximals or the Predacons in a series of missions to undermine the other faction's attempts at gaining enough resources to win the war between them and escape the planet. It was given a multiplayer feature (removed from the console releases) that allowed up to 8 players to play over LAN, with its own play rooms in the MS Gaming Zone (they have subsequently been removed).\n\nThe second game, \"\", is a Fighting Vipers-style fighting game based on the second season released by Bay Area Multimedia. This game was memorable for having most of the cast members from the show reprise their voice roles.\n\nA third game was in the works for the PlayStation 2, but was scrapped in pre-production, without any official word as to why, or how far the project was before the plug was pulled.\n\nThe series was originally released on DVD in Region 1 by Rhino Entertainment in 2003/2004. These releases have been discontinued and are now out of print.\n\nOn February 8, 2011, Shout! Factory announced that they had acquired the rights to the series and planned to re-release it. They subsequently re-released season 1 on DVD on June 7, 2011 as well as a complete series set on the same day. Both releases contain extensive bonus features including interviews, featurettes and special 24 page comic book- Transformers Timelines \"Dawn of Future's Past.\" Season 2 & 3 was re-released on October 4, 2011.\n\nIn Region 4, Madman Entertainment released all three seasons on DVD in Australia in 2006. On June 24, 2009, they released \"Transformers: Beast Wars - Complete Collection\". The 10-disc box set features all 52 episodes of the series as well as many bonus features.\n\nWhile the toyline was lauded for its innovative joint construction and the show is overall liked by fans, the show was initially derided by a large portion of loyal Generation 1 fans for using animals, dinosaurs and insects instead of vehicles for the line's alternate forms. For the majority of season 1 developers were confronted with hate mail from disgruntled fans. An internet social battle emerged between old school original die hard fans and the new age fans. \"Trukk not Munky\" became the banner and popular argument material for unhappy watchers.\n\nIronically \"Beast Wars\" turned out to be mutually adored by both old and new fans alike. Mainframe integrated enough G1 cameos and easter eggs to win over any watcher old or new. Beast Wars is still known as one of the greatest Transformer story incarnations and has stood the test of time—so much that a 10th anniversary toy line was released by Hasbro in honor of the show's success over the years. Even now Hasbro is still producing new toy molds of fan favorite characters of the show. Overall, \"Beast Wars\" was well received and is often praised for its mature tone and character development, in addition to its blend of comic relief and darker storylines.\n\nThe season two episode \"Code of Hero\" became regarded as one of the best episodes in Transformers history. Dinobot became the first \"Beast Wars\" character to be inducted into the Transformers Hall of Fame in 2010. Waspinator, Beast Wars Megatron, and Optimus Primal later followed.\n\nThe Beast Wars franchise would go on for years worldwide. In animation, the show was succeeded by \"\", with a new creative team in charge of production. The traditionally-animated Japanese series \"Beast Wars II\" and \"Beast Wars Neo\" were created to fill the gap while the second and third seasons of \"Beast Wars\" were being translated into Japanese (called \"Beast Wars: Metals\"). Several and were also produced. Beast Wars was also the second television series created by Mainframe Entertainment and Alliance Atlantis Communications, two now-defunct companies who are the same creators of the world's first ever entirely-CGI television series \"ReBoot\", which aired two years prior to Beast Wars.\n\nOn June 21, 2017, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura announced that a film adaptation of \"Beast Wars\" was not in plans, as he explained: \"I'm probably not the one to be asking that question to because I don't get \"Beast Wars\", but you know, thankfully I'm not the only vote on it. I've never quite understood, they kind of feel like incompatible to me, you have animals, robots, we're used to cars.\"\n\n"}

In media such as television and film, the device is an opportunity for two actors to temporarily play each other's characters, although in some cases, dialogue is dubbed by the original actors.\n\nThere are different types of body swapping. For non-technology swapping, switches can be caused by magic items such as amulets, heartfelt wishes, or just strange quirks of the universe. The switches typically reverse after the subjects have expanded their world views, gained a new appreciation for each other's troubles by literally \"walking in another's shoes\" and/or caused sufficient amounts of farce. Notable examples include the books \"Vice Versa\" (1882) and \"Freaky Friday\" (1972), as well as the film versions of both.\n\nSwitches accomplished by technology, exempting gadgets advanced sufficiently to appear as magic, are the fare of mad scientists. Body-swapping devices are usually characterized by a highly experimental status, straps, helmets with many complicated cables that run to a central system and a tendency to direly malfunction before their effects can be reversed. Those without such means may resort to brain transplants. Such experiments can have overtones of horror.\n\nSince the \"Vice Versa\" novel was published in 1882, body swaps have been a popular theme in various media:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15982563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15982563", "title": "Bug Too!", "text": "Bug Too!\n\nBug Too! is a platforming video game, the sequel to \"Bug!\". \"Bug Too!\" was originally released for the Sega Saturn on November 30, 1996 in North America. It was then ported to Windows on December 10, 1996.\n\nThe background plot involves popular action film stars Bug, Maggot Dog, and Super Fly being signed for a six picture deal, with all six movies being filmed in a single day.\n\nThe players can play as Bug, Maggot Dog, or Super Fly. \"Bug Too!\" is played like a traditional side-scrolling platform game. The player character must make his way through all the levels in each zone, with a boss level at the end of each zone. \"Bug Too!\" has 3D levels, which take the side-view and tweak it. Bug can walk sideways up vertical surfaces and even upside down.\n\nUnlike the original \"Bug!\", \"Bug Too\" has a run button. The two-player mode allows players to alternate playing the game and compete for high scores.\n\nWhen the player finishes a stage with at least 100 crystals collected, they are sent to one of several bonus stages. If the player collects a bonus stage's requisite number of Oscars, they earn an extra life.\n\n\"Bug Too!\" was met with mixed reviews. Critics were generally pleased with the series additions of the run ability and new characters, though some noted that there is little gameplay difference between them and Bug. However, while the graphics in general were praised, critics found the fixed side-view camera created frustrating problems with the gameplay, such as walls obstructing the player's view of Bug and difficulty judging distances when moving between the foreground and background. The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" deemed it an overall fun title, though not a must-have. \"GamePro\"s Major Mike concluded, \"\"Bug Too!\" meets the expectations of its predecessor and at times exceeds them. Fans of the first game will definitely want to check it out, and for all you newcomers, it's a great time to get bugged.\" Lee Nutter of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" similarly stated, \"In all, \"Bug Too!\" is a top quality platform game surpassing its predecessors in all areas. But to be honest it really is just more of the same which is great if you liked the original. However, those who didn't won't find anything new to tempt them into purchasing it.\" A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" regarded this lack of genuine innovation over the first game to be a particularly strong strike against it, and compared the game unfavorably to contemporary Saturn platformers \"Nights into Dreams\" and \"Sonic 3D Blast\". Jeff Gerstmann of \"GameSpot\" also compared it unfavorably to \"Sonic 3D Blast\", and remarked, \"The choice of films is far hipper than \"Spot Goes To Hollywood\", but the game doesn't play much better.\"\n\n"}

The game was first released in 1984 by RSC Soft.\n\nThe player assumes the role of Simon the Hero, who must navigate through ten mazes in search of the diamond. Simon must gather certain items—a key and a lock—in order to reveal the doorway to the next maze. Each maze is completed when Simon escapes through the exit.\n\nDuring his journey, Simon must avoid the various enemies in order to stay alive. The enemies along travel in a constant path at different speeds. This makes them somewhat predictable, and they can be avoided with good timing and a proper strategy. Simon has the ability to run, which can be used to help avoid the enemies. Simon is also vulnerable to other static dangers; he will die if he comes in contact with the electric walls throughout the castle or if too much time is taken to complete a maze.\n\nIn addition to the key and the lock, there are other objects that can aid Simon on his quest. The potion of life is introduced in the eponymous \"Potion of Life\" level and reappears in the levels \"Dark Walls\" and \"Black Room\". Collecting the potion gives the player an extra life. The lantern appears only in Level 8 (Black Room) and allows the player to see the illuminated layout of the maze. The potion and lantern are very helpful, but they are not required in order to complete the game.\n\n"}

{"id": "41866974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41866974", "title": "Chordioid", "text": "Chordioid\n\nA chordioid, also called \"chord fragment\" or \"fragmentary voicing\" or \"partial voicing\", is a group of musical notes which does not qualify as a chord under some preferred chord theory or other, but still useful to name and reify for other reasons.\n\nThe main use of chordioids is to form \"legitimate\" chords enharmonically in 12TET by adding one or more notes to this base. It is typical of chordioids that many different resultant chords can be created from the same base depending on the note or combination of notes added. The resultant chords on a single chordioid are somewhat related, because they can be progressed between using motion of just one voice. Theorists – or practical music teachers – writing of chordioids usually go so far as to advise that students learn them in the practical manner of chords generally: in all transpositions, ranges, permutations, and voicings, for reading, writing, and playing.\nIt is the case, also, that \"legitimate chords\" can be used as chordioids to create resultant chords by the same process. Perhaps this is whence the non-chord chordioids come. The Italian augmented 6th chord (It+6) is one example, from which proceed the French augmented 6th chord (Fr+6) and German augmented 6th chord (Gr+6) by addition of one note. Rawlins(2005) asserts that the notion derives from practice of such composers as Eric Satie, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Gabriel Faure, and was first used in jazz by Bill Evans.\n\nTwo chordioids may potentially be combined, as well. Typically, duplication of notes will result in a reduced number of unique notes in the resultant.\n\nChordioids as a technique is related to polychords insofar as polychords are the result of an additive process, but differs in that the basis of polychords is the addition of two known chords. Chordioids is related also to upper structures as a technique insofar as upper structures represent groups of notes not commonly taken to be \"legitimate\" chords, but differs in that chordioids as a technique uses \"a priori\" structures held in common rather than a free selection of color tones appropriate for a lower integral chord. Chordioids is related to slash chords as a technique insofar as known chords may be used as chordioids to create resultant scales, but differs in that chordioids used are not exclusively known chords.\n\nNicolas Slonimsky named \"master chord\" that chordioid described in jazz chord theory as 7no5, e.g.: The sonority of the chordioid itself is identical to that of the It+6, a subset of the Wholetone scale and so subject to some of the symmetries and homogeneity for which that scale is known, and anhemitonic allowing the possibility that the resultant scale be anhemitonic or at least ancohemitonic itself.\n\nThe chord buttons of the Accordion usually play master chords, allowing the bass buttons (or a second chord button) to supply the variable note (or notes) to complete the sonority.\n\nThe new name and concept, \"master chord\", thus does not imply either jazz derivation, completeness of the sonority as an independent chord, nor connection to other use as a chord of dominant function. It does not speciously denote anything to be \"missing\", or posit that the listener should ever hear a note not actually present. It rejects the tertian chordal basis as pertaining at all. These, the practicality of application, and the variety of use, are the logical basis of chordioids.\n\nThe following table shows the resultant chord for some of the possible added notes:\n\nRobert Rawlins based his theory of chordioids off the above as well as permutations of other major and minor 7th chords. He described his chordiods as the interval of a 2nd below the interval of a 3rd.\n\nBased upon M7no5, e.g.: { C D F }:\n\nBased upon mM7no5, e.g.: { C D F }:\n\n, the sonority of the chordioid itself is anhemitonic allowing the possibility that the resultant scale be anhemitonic or at least ancohemitonic itself.\n\nJoseph Schillinger based his theory of chordioids off the above as well as those irregular voicings of 7th chords in which the 5th is present but the 3rd absent, and of 9th chords in which the 5th and 3rd are both absent.\n\n, the sonority of the chordioid itself is anhemitonic allowing the possibility that the resultant scale be anhemitonic or at least ancohemitonic itself.\n\nBased upon M7no3, e.g.: { C G B }:\n\n, the sonority of the chordioid itself is identical to that of the base triad of the Fr+6, a subset of the Wholetone scale and so subject to some of the symmetries and homogeneity for which that scale is known, and anhemitonic allowing the possibility that the resultant scale be anhemitonic or at least ancohemitonic itself.\n\nBased upon M75no3, e.g.: { C G B }:\n\n, the sonority of the chordioid itself is a subset of the Wholetone scale and so subject to some of the symmetries and homogeneity for which that scale is known, and anhemitonic allowing the possibility that the resultant scale be anhemitonic or at least ancohemitonic itself.\n\nBased upon M75no3, e.g.: { C G B }:\n\n, the sonority of the chordioid itself is a subset of the Wholetone scale and so subject to some of the symmetries and homogeneity for which that scale is known, and anhemitonic allowing the possibility that the resultant scale be anhemitonic or at least ancohemitonic itself.\n\nBased upon M9no5no3, e.g.: { C D B }:\n\n, the sonority of the chordioid itself is anhemitonic allowing the possibility that the resultant scale be anhemitonic or at least ancohemitonic itself.\n\nBased upon M9no5no3, e.g.: { C D B }, the sonority of the chordioid itself is cohemitonic assuring that the resultant scale be cohemitonic itself.\n\n, the sonority of the chordioid itself is anhemitonic allowing the possibility that the resultant scale be anhemitonic or at least ancohemitonic itself.\n\nBased upon M9no5no3, e.g.: { C D B }:\n\nBased upon 11no5no9 (or 7sus4), e.g.: { C F B }, the sonority of the chordioid itself is anhemitonic allowing the possibility that the resultant scale be anhemitonic or at least ancohemitonic itself.\n\nBased upon M11no5no9 (or M7sus4), e.g.: { C F B }:\n\nHarmonically, augmented sixth chords (+6ths) in prime position require three things:\n\nGiven these requirements, which are minimally fulfilled by the Italian sixth (It+6), e.g.: { A C F }, it is possible to derive all potential +6 chords from the It+6. The following table illustrates:\n\nJoseph Schillinger also used basic triads and the master chord as chordioids in building bigger structures, textures, and strata. His 7th chords were based upon single notes added below major, minor, diminished, or augmented triads; some of his hybrid 4-part harmony (including 11th and 13th chords) likewise.\n\n"}

These directors were said to favor style over substance, spectacle over narrative. It referred to films that had a slick, gorgeous visual style and a focus on young, alienated characters who were said to represent the marginalized youth of François Mitterrand's France. Themes that run through many of their films include doomed love affairs, young people more affiliated to peer groups than families, a cynical view of the police, and the use of scenes in the Paris Métro to symbolise an alternative, underground society. The mixture of 'high' culture, such as the opera music of \"Diva\" and \"Les Amants du Pont-Neuf,\" and pop culture, for example the references to Batman in \"Subway\", was another key feature.\n\nFrench filmmakers were inspired by New Hollywood films (most notably Francis Ford Coppola's \"One from the Heart\" and \"Rumble Fish\"), late Fassbinder films (\"Lola\"), as well as television commercials, music videos, and fashion photography.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3817946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3817946", "title": "Dotch Cooking Show", "text": "Dotch Cooking Show\n\nThe (April 17, 1997 – March 17, 2005) was a Japanese cooking show produced by the Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation and known for its use of the highest quality and most expensive food ingredients available from both domestic and international sources. In the show two chefs prepare two competing dishes, each using a special premium ingredient, but the dish that is ultimately served at the end of the show is determined by majority vote of the panelists, and then served only to those who voted for that dish. The show is continued by the from April 14, 2005.\n\nEach of the two hosts, Hiroshi Sekiguchi (関口宏) and Yuji Miyake (三宅裕司), chooses a particular dish for the contest, and oversees the dish's creation by his chef. For most of the show's run, Sekiguchi was in charge of the Red kitchen, and Miyake took the Yellow kitchen. In later episodes, the two dishes were pre-selected, and whichever meal Sekiguchi and Miyake prepared for his side was determined by a special dice throw. The competing dishes were typically from the same category; an example of a typical \"battle\" would be miso ramen versus salt-and-butter ramen. Other battles have included miso-based dishes versus mayonnaise-based dishes, chocolate fondant cake versus fruit tart, and even tacos versus spring rolls.\n\nThe seven guests would be asked to choose which meal they would most like to eat. Unlike Iron Chef, where the judges would get to eat the food prepared by both chefs, only the guests who chose the winning dish were allowed to eat. There were three periods when the guests would vote; the first was when the dishes were announced, the second was after the \"tasting time,\" and the third was after both dishes had been completed. Though Sekiguchi and Miyake would be allowed to taste the dishes in progress and describe what they had eaten (often in dramatic fashion), the guests were allowed only one \"tasting time,\" where they got a sample of each kitchen's special ingredient, usually prepared in a manner similar to how it would be for the finished product. In the later episodes of the show, the tasting time was eliminated for all but one of the guests. The lucky guest, who was randomly chosen, would be allowed the samples as previously described, and would then have to describe what they tasted to the other guests. As a result, they would be the only one asked to choose the dish they wanted during the second voting. This was done to increase the suspense for the TV audience and put the guests on the same level as the audience.\n\nWhile the chefs were preparing their dishes, each side would reveal a special ingredient that they hoped would sway the guests to vote for their respective dishes. The special ingredients could be anything from the focus of the recipe, such as a meat or vegetable, to a sauce or flavoring component. Though most of the special ingredients were found in often remote areas of Japan, some came from outside Japan, such as Mongolia, Korea, and even Scotland. In very rare and unusual instances, the special ingredients were not food items, but rather tools for preparing or serving the dish, such as a granite bowl from Korea, used in the preparation of stone-cooked bibimbap, or a special cast iron press used to make taiyaki. Each kitchen's special assistant would go to where the special ingredient was grown/raised/manufactured/harvested, to both procure the special ingredient and observe how it was produced.\n\nAt the end of the show, the two hosts would declare in unison: \" The word \", which appears in the show's graphics, is a transliteration of the Japanese word meaning \"which one\". The guests would press a button (corresponding to which dish they chose) and the side with the most votes was declared the winner. The winning host would then ask the loser to withdraw (\"tesshū\", 撤收). The losing host and his chef would then take away their losing dish, and the winning guests and host would then dine on their selection. The hungry losers would watch the winners eat. This would often be followed by a scene of the winning host and guests leaving the show set satisfied after their meal, a scene of the losing host and guests griping about not getting to eat as they left the studio, or sometimes both. At the very end of the show, the losing chef would typically be shown eating his dish alone, wondering why he did not win.\n\nSince each side had to prepare food for eight people (seven guests and the winning host, in the event of a complete 7-0 victory (later 9 portions for seven guests, the winning host, and the assistant for the winning kitchen) and typically fewer than that number would actually get to eat, any food left over after the winners had eaten was usually consumed by the show's crew. Since each show usually took hours to film, the hunger expressed by the losing guests at the end was genuine.\n\n[Later episodes of The New Dotch Cooking Show: Keisuke Mori (森圭介, an announcer at Nippon TV) becomes the new assistant]\n\n\nThe assistants reported, newscaster-style, on the obtaining of special ingredients. The chefs were hired from a pool of highly skilled cooks.\n\nThe format of the show is basically the same, except that tasting time has been completely eliminated for the contestants (Sekiguchi and Miyake still get to taste the works in progress). The contestant roster was expanded from 7 to 11 (occasionally 9), with 4 celebrity contestants (Tsuyoshi Kusanagi still appeared as a regular) and 7 (occasionally 5) additional contestants, called \"Hara-Helicopters,\" drawn from a pool. Typically, the Hara-Helicopters are everyday people, though some groups are distinctly categorized, e.g. schoolchildren, \"idols,\" \"young men who have not eaten for 48 hours,\" or restaurateurs. During the preparation of the meals, the celebrity contestants would be allowed to observe each chef's methods up close, and smell/feel (not taste) the various ingredients used, while the Hara-Helicopters would watch the action from their seats overlooking the stage. In some episodes, Kusanagi would bring a plate of one of the special ingredients up to the Hara-Helicopters so they could smell it. The series went on hiatus on September 14, 2006\nand returned on January 4, 2007 for a one-time only TV special.\n\n\n\n"}

Two months after the release of \"King Daddy\", Daddy Yankee announced that there was going to be a physical version of the album, with exclusive bonus tracks, planned to be released during 2014, but it was not published after all.\n\nThe Puerto Rican production duo Los de la Nazza, which had been working with Daddy Yankee since 2007, left El Cartel Records and stopped being his main producers in order to focus on their careers.

A day later, he received a Puerto Rican Walk of Fame Star in San Juan, becoming the first urban act to do so.\n\n\"Sígueme y Te Sigo\" is a dance love song written by Daddy Yankee, Chris Jeday and Luis \"Wichi\" Ortíz Rivera, inspired by social networks but not centred on them, and mixes reggaeton with Latin pop, including an electric guitar riff.\n\n\"Vaivén\" is a moombahton song written by Daddy Yankee, Luis \"Wichi\" Ortíz Rivera and the producer Chris Jeday.\n\n\"Shaky Shaky\" is a reggaeton song born as a freestyle during early December 2015, and was later recorded by the production duo Los Evo Jedis. According to Daddy Yankee, the main vocals were recorded in one take and the song musically mixes sounds from old and new school reggaeton. The keyboard bass line was based on the one from the single \"Murder She Wrote\" by Chaka Demus & Pliers, released in 1992. It also includes a repeating sample of a horse's neigh from Mel and Tim's \"Good Guys Only Win in the Movies\" (1970), which became popular after Cypress Hill's \"Insane in the Brain\" (1993).\n\n\"Otra Cosa\" features Dominican singer Natti Natasha and is a fusion between reggaeton, dancehall and moombahton music written by Daddy Yankee, Natti Natasha and Puerto Rican producer Haze. The lyrics are about lovesickness. The concept of the song was brought to Daddy Yankee by Haze and Natti Natasha in order to be included on the track listing of \"La Super Fórmula\", a Pina Records studio album by various artists.\n\n\"La Rompe Corazones\" features Puerto Rican singer Ozuna and was written by Daddy Yankee, Ozuna, Chris Jeday and Puerto Rican songwriter Jesús \"Benny Benni\" Benitez Hiraldo. The song tells the story of a lovesick woman who no longer trusts her relationships, taking revenge on other men through her frustration.\n\nThe first known recording session for \"El Disco Duro\" with producers Chris Jeday and Gaby Music was held in December 2014. The last known session was carried out in May 2017 with the recording of the track \"Percocet\". The recording was resumed during mid-October 2016 with Daddy Yankee and Dominican singer Natti Natasha recording the single \"Otra Cosa\" for Pina Records' upcoming studio album \"La Super Fórmula\". However, Daddy Yankee managed to include the track on \"El Disco Duro\" during December 2016. On February 21, 2017, Daddy Yankee uploaded an image on his official Instagram account listening to the album.\n\nStudios where the album was recorded includes Daddy Yankee's El Cartel Studios in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Chris Jeday's Music Capos Studios in Puerto Rico, Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, USA, and Master House Studios in Doral, Florida, USA.\n\n\"Sígueme y Te Sigo\" was mixed at El Cartel Studios in February 2015. Sound test for \"Vaivén\" was held by Chris Jeday at Music Capos Studios during early August 2015. The song was later mixed at Criteria Studios and at El Cartel Studios the same month.\n\nDaddy Yankee confirmed on October 26, 2016 during a meeting with Zumba fitness creator Beto Perez at Pina Records that \"El Disco Duro\" will be released during early 2017, most likely during January or February. On June 21, 2017, Daddy Yankee stated that he postponed the album's release due to finding more successful the release of singles instead of an entire record. In December 2014, \"Billboard\" magazine added digital and streaming information to count sales: 1,000 digital songs sales and 1,500 song streams separately equal one album sale, which may affect the chart placement of the album. Considered on-demand audio services includes Spotify, Google Play, Beats Music and Xbox Music.\n\n\"Sígueme y Te Sigo\" was released as the first single on March 12, 2015. It peaked at number 6 on the US Hot Latin Songs chart on June 13, 2015 and at number 5 on Tropical Songs on April 18, 2015. Internationally, the song peaked at number 12 in Spain, at number 32 in Venezuela, and at number 198 in France. It was certified 2× platinum by the PROMUSICAE, platinum by the IFPI Chile, and gold by the FIMI.\n\n\"Vaivén\" was released as the second single on September 17, 2016. Although the song does not have an official music video, it managed to peak at number 7 on the US Hot Latin Songs chart and at number 3 on Tropical Songs, both on January 23, 2016. Internationally, the single reached number 19 in Spain and number 34 in Venezuela. It received a platinum certification by the PROMUSICAE and the IFPI Chile.\n\n\"Shaky Shaky\" was released as the third single on April 8, 2016, although it was originally planned as a gift from Yankee to his fans for 2015 Christmas.

It features reggaeton duo Plan B and was written by Daddy Yankee, Plan B, and the producer Haze. It peaked at number 49 on the US Hot Latin Songs chart on February 28, 2015.\n\n\"Alerta Roja\" was released as a promotional song on Daddy Yankee's birthday on February 3, 2016 as a gift to his fans. The song's concept was to include some of the most popular Latin urban artists. Singers Osmani García and J Álvarez (Cuban and Puerto Rican, respectively) were originally guest artists but their verses were not included in the song. J Álvarez stated not knowing about being out of it and manifestated his anger with Daddy Yankee through his social networks. Two weeks later, Álvarez said that he was not aware of the song's concept and also that his anger was caused by a misunderstanding.\n\n\"Otra Cosa\" was released as a promotional single on December 9, 2016 and features Natti Natasha. The song was released as the first single of Pina Records' upcoming studio album, \"La Súper Fórmula\", but Daddy Yankee managed to also include it on \"El Disco Duro\".

He was a Boy Scout in his youth. After serving in the Second World War, he was imprisoned by the Nazis in 1942 and spent seven months in solitary confinement for \"Betätigung zur Wiederherstellung eines freien Österreich\" (activities to restore Austrian independence—see Anschluss).\n\nAfter the war, Muliar started his career as a stage actor. Of small build, he once said that his ambitions had never included playing parts such as that of Othello. Rather, he had always preferred comic roles and traditional Austrian fare (Johann Nestroy, Ferdinand Raimund). Muliar also excelled in imitating various accents, in particular those used by Czech and Yiddish speakers of German. In 1990, he had enormous success in Felix Mitterer's play for one person, \"Siberia\" (televised in 1991), a study in ageism about an old man who has been abandoned by his family in a retirement home and his struggle for dignity.\n\nWhile he also performed regularly at the Salzburg Festival in the play \"Jedermann\" (a version of \"Everyman\"), Muliar was associated with two Viennese theatres in particular: the Burgtheater (whose tenured member he was until his retirement), and the Theater in der Josefstadt, where he worked until his death in 2009. He was one of the severest critics of Claus Peymann (born 1937), director of the Burgtheater between 1986 and 1999 whose leadership polarized Austrian theatregoers by its focus on controversial playwrights such as Thomas Bernhard and Elfriede Jelinek. Musical theatre saw Muliar in the non-singing role of Frosch in \"Die Fledermaus\". At Theater in der Josefstadt, Muliar was perhaps best known for the role of Mr. Green in Jeff Baron's Visiting Mr. Green (Besuch bei Mr Green). Muliar, Michael Dangl the theater and Jeff Baron were awarded the 2001 Kulturpreis Europa for this production, which ran for several seasons and was nationally telecast.\n\nMuliar appeared in numerous films and in some television series such as \"Kir Royal\" (alongside Franz Xaver Kroetz) and \"Kommissar Rex\". He is best remembered beyond the boundaries of his native Vienna for playing the title role in the 13-part TV series, \"Die Abenteuer des braven Soldaten Schwejk\", which was filmed in German and broadcast by the Austrian state TV (ORF) in 1972.\n\nMuliar was a committed Social Democrat who publicly supported various Austrian Social Democratic politicians during their election campaigns. He was married from 1955 to Franziska Kalmar, Austria's first television presenter. In January 2006 he was elected to the position of a public advisor in the Austrian state TV (ORF). He died in Vienna, aged 89.\n\n\n"}

The game was published by Gamecock Media Group on October 16, 2007, and was the first game they published. Less than two months later, the developer announced it had laid off all employees. The game switched to a free-to-play model, but in October 2008 Auran shutdown the game servers meaning the game would no longer be playable.\n\n\"Fury\" focus on PvP combat differentiated it from traditional RPGs that center around player versus environment (PvE) content against non-player characters. However, like most RPGs, \"Fury\" used collectible equipment, skills, and a ranking mechanism for players. \"Fury\" used a method of matching equally ranked players from across the world in PvP matches.\n\n\"Fury\" further differentiated itself from traditional RPGs by making many of its spells and abilities activate instantly and lacking a cooldown period. The pace of gameplay thus tended to be faster than PvP combat in traditional RPGs. For example, spell-casters in \"Fury\" were sometimes not frozen in place when casting a spell, which allowed them to retreat and avoid obstacles that might otherwise have locked them in.\n\nThe game was initially well received in beta testing and during a pre-release event known as the \"Fury Challenge\"; however, many aspects of the game were changed before the public release.\n\nAt the beginning of 2008, a large change was made to the game mechanics and the business plan of \"Fury\". This made the game completely free to play, with the option of upgrading to the two previous payment options: retail price (a one-time fee), and Immortal (monthly payments). Additionally, all players prior to this large patch were given Immortal status free for life.\n\nA new business plan was drafted late in the game's life which attempted to save the game. This plan included a match limit for free players and the possibility for skilled players to turn their skill into cash; however, the servers shut down before this plan was ever implemented.\n\n\"Fury\" received below average reviews from major gaming websites, having a score of 53.65% on GameRankings and a score of 55/100 on Metacritic.\n\nGameSpot gave the game 4.5 out of 10, highlighting its poorly optimized engine, and its clumsy and chaotic gameplay. IGN gave a 6.5 out of 10, however ultimately criticized similar concepts, such as excessive numbers of useless skills, too many NPCs and minimal longevity.\n"}

The service was accessible via a toll-free telephone number. It was an alternative to 4-1-1, an often-expensive service provided by local and long-distance phone companies, and was therefore commonly known as Google 411. This service was discontinued on November 12, 2010.\n\nGOOG 411 had been assisting people with obtaining phone numbers since 2007. On November 12, 2010, GOOG-411 shut down its service. While Google did not provide an official reason for the shut down, many believe that Google had simply gathered enough voice samples for its research purposes. Google also operated a similar service from SMS number 466453 which has also been discontinued.\n\nUsers who called the toll-free telephone numbers 800-466-4411 or 877-466-4411 (800-GOOG-411 and 877-GOOG-411) or the local number 425-296-4774 were asked for the city and state of the sought business. Users were also able to search for by business name or category, which generated a list of up to eight search results. Search was also invoked by using the keypad if the user preferred. This worked in a similar manner to predictive text input on a cellular phone. Users were able to select the destination by speaking or pressing the number that corresponded to the desired result. Once the destination was selected, the service placed a call to the business or returned a text message with the phone number. Alternatively, users were able to listen to the street address and phone number by saying \"details\". U.S. users could narrow search results by ZIP code or street intersection.\n\nAlthough Google's FAQ stated that users were able to prevent their phone number from being saved by blocking their caller ID, this is ineffective when calling the 800 number (due to ANI) and only works when calling the other two.\nThe service announced that the call may be recorded for the purpose of service improvements.\n\nGoogle advised users not to use the service for emergency calls, recommending that they call 9-1-1.\n\nGoogle had stated that the company originally implemented GOOG-411 to build a large phoneme database from users' voice queries. This phoneme database, in turn, allowed Google engineers to refine and improve the speech recognition engine that Google uses to index audio content for searching.\n\n"}

Although their homophobia was minuscule compared to other rappers in hip hop, “Rapper’s Delight” did exhibit slights to fictional character Superman, who was referred to as a “fairy” for wearing a tight suit. \n\nIn 1986, the hip hop trio Beastie Boys originally wanted to name their debut album \"Don’t Be A Faggot\", but their record label Columbia Records refused to release it under that title, so it changed to \"Licensed To Ill\". Years later, the Beastie Boys formally apologized to the LGBT community for the “shitty and ignorant” things they said on their first record.\n\nIce-T stated on his autobiography that record-label executive Seymour Stein took the exception to a homophobic line in his song \"409\": \"Guys grab a girl, girls grab a guy/If a guy wants a guy, please take it outside\". Ice-T later became one of the first rappers to condemn homophobia on raps such as \"Straight Up Nigga\" and \"The Tower\" in his album \"OG Original Gangster\".\n\nMany songs by rapper Eminem have been considered homophobic for his frequent use of anti-gay slurs, especially the song \"Criminal\" from his third album \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" (2000), which containing lines like: \"My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge, That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez. pants or dress? Hate fags? The answer's 'yes'\". In an interview with Anderson Cooper on \"60 Minutes\", Eminem denies being homophobic and explained the frequent use of the slur \"faggot\" in his lyrics, that this word was \"thrown around constantly\" in battle rapping and he does not refer it to gay people. The album \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" was nominated for Album of the Year by the Grammy Awards 2001, which leads to protests due to the album's controversial content. At the show, Eminem performed \"Stan\" with openly gay musician Elton John as response.\n\nIn the lyrics of one song on rapper Trick-Trick's 2008 album \"The Villain\", he refers to Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O'Donnell as \"dyke bitches\" and says he will send a \"scud missile right through their fucking cruise ship\".

The modern name was invented by Howard Carter, who found one complete gaming set in a Theban tomb that dates to the 13th Dynasty. The latter game set is one of the best preserved examples and is today in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He called it \"Hounds contra Jackals\". Another modern name for this game, but not so often used is fifty-eight holes.\n\nThe gaming board has two sets of 29 holes. Gaming pieces are ten small sticks with either jackal or dog heads. The aim of the game was perhaps to start at one point on the board and to reach with all figures another point on the board. The game appeared in Egypt, around 2000 BC and was mainly popular in the Middle Kingdom. However, it is also known from Mesopotamia and the Caucasus. In the 1956 movie \"The 10 Commandments\", Pharaoh Seti and Nefretiri are depicted playing the game.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "711881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=711881", "title": "Independent Local Radio", "text": "Independent Local Radio\n\nIndependent Local Radio is the collective name given to commercial radio stations in the United Kingdom. As a result of the buyouts and mergers permitted by the Broadcasting Act of 1990, and deregulation resulting from the Communications Act 2003, most commercial stations are now neither independent nor local. The same name is used for Independent Local Radio in Ireland.\n\nUntil the early 1970s, the BBC had a legal monopoly on radio broadcasting in the UK. Despite competition from the commercial Radio Luxembourg and, for a period in the mid-1960s, the off-shore \"pirate\" broadcasters, it had remained the policy of both major political parties that radio was to remain under the BBC.\n\nUpon the election of Edward Heath's government in 1970, this policy changed. It is possible that Heath's victory was partly due to younger voters upset by the UK government closing down the popular pirate radio stations.\n\nThe new Minister of Post and Telecommunications, Christopher Chataway, announced a Bill to allow for the introduction of commercial radio in the United Kingdom. This service would be planned and regulated in a similar manner to the existing ITV service and would compete with the recently developed BBC Local Radio services (rather than the four national BBC services).\n\nThe Sound Broadcasting Act received Royal Assent on 12 July 1972 and the Independent Television Authority (ITA) accordingly changed its name to the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) that same day.\n\nThe IBA immediately began to plan the new service, placing advertisements encouraging interested groups to apply for medium-term contracts to provide programmes in given areas. The first major areas to be advertised were London and Glasgow, with two contracts available in London, one for \"news and information\", one for \"general and entertainment\".\n\nThe London news contract was awarded to London Broadcasting Company (LBC) and they began broadcasting on 8 October 1973. The London general contract went to Capital Radio, who began broadcasting on 16 October 1973. In total, 19 contracts were awarded between 1973 and 1976. Due to government limits on capital expenditure and turbulence in the broadcasting field (mainly due to the Annan Report), no further contracts were awarded until 1980, when a second tranche of contracts were awarded. All stations were awarded an AM and an FM frequency, on which they broadcast the same service.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the expansion of ILR continued at a similar rate. Under the Broadcasting Acts, the IBA had a duty to ensure that any area it licensed for radio could support a station with the available advertising revenue. Therefore, many areas were not included in the IBA's ILR plans as it was felt that they were not viable. This did not prevent Radio West in Bristol getting into financial trouble and having to merge with Wiltshire Radio on 1 October 1985; nor did it prevent Centre Radio going into receivership on 6 October 1983.\n\nNevertheless, the areas served by ILR continued to increase and 1986 the IBA sanctioned in principle the idea that different services could be broadcast on each station's FM and AM frequency. The first experimental part-time split service was provided by Radio Forth, who created Festival City Radio for the duration of the Edinburgh Festival in 1984. The first station to permanently split their frequencies was Guildford's County Sound who rebranded the FM output as Premier Radio and turned the AM output into a new golden oldies station, County Sound Gold in 1988. Other stations then followed suit.\n\nBy 1988, the government had decided that the practice of splitting was beneficial and a quick way to increase choice for listeners. The IBA then began a programme of encouraging ILR stations to split their services and most stations had soon complied. The usual format was to have a \"gold\" (oldies) service on AM and pop music on FM, although Radio City tried \"City Talk\" on AM before abandoning the format.\n\nThe 1990 Broadcasting Act provided for the abolition of the IBA and its replacement by the Independent Television Commission. The IBA continued to regulate radio under the new name of the Radio Authority, but with a different remit.\n\nAs a \"light-touch\" regulator (although heavier than the ITC), the Radio Authority was to issue licences to the highest bidder and promote the development of commercial radio choice.\n\nThis led to the awarding of three national contracts (known as Independent National Radio, but still usually referred to under the banner of \"ILR\" by most commentators) to Classic FM, Virgin 1215 (later Virgin Radio and then rebranded Absolute Radio) and Talk Radio (later talkSPORT).\n\nThe Radio Authority also began to license Restricted Service Licence (RSL) stations – low-power temporary radio stations for special events, operating for up to 28 days a year – and to reduce the criteria for a \"viable service area\" with the introduction of Small Scale Local Licences (SALLIES) for villages, special interest groups and small communities.\n\nBy this time the medium wave band had become unpopular with radio groups and the majority of new stations were awarded an FM licence only, even when an AM licence was jointly available.\n\nThe Radio Authority also introduced regional stations (Independent Regional Radio, again usually grouped under the banner \"ILR\" by most commentators) and began to license the commercial Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) multiplexes in October 1998.\n\nThe Radio Authority was replaced by the Office of Communications (Ofcom) in 2004, which also replaced the ITC, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the Radio Communications Agency and the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel). Ofcom has stated that they plan to continue the development of Independent Local Radio, with an emphasis on digital broadcasting, and to \"ensure the character\" of local stations, following the mergers and loss of local identities that followed the 1990 Act.\n\nAs of 2005, there are 217 licensed analogue ILR and IRR services in England; 16 in Wales; 34 in Scotland; eight in Northern Ireland; and two in the Channel Islands. These are \"licences\" rather than \"franchises\". Some licences are grouped nationally, regionally or by format to provide one service; other licences cover two or more services.\n\nThere are three national analogue services. There is one national DAB service (Digital One) and 47 regional DAB services, owned by 10 and operated by nine companies.\n\nThe first licensed commercial radio station in the United Kingdom is often stated to be Manx Radio, which launched in June 1964. However, since the Isle of Man is not part of the United Kingdom, Manx Radio is not considered to be an ILR station and launched with a Post Office licence. Manx Radio is funded by a mixture of commercial advertising and a yearly £860,000 Manx Government subvention.\n\n\n\n"}

It has a strategic partnership with fellow Japanese MMA promotion Jewels.\n\nWhen Zuffa, parent company of the UFC, purchased rival promotion Strikeforce in , Shannon Knapp received several calls from female fighters who were afraid of what the future might hold for them in Strikeforce since the UFC had never promoted a women's fight. As the women were calling Knapp for representation, she started looking at the issue and met Janet Martin, and between the two acquired the financial resources needed.\n\nThe term \"Invicta\", a Latin word for \"invincible and incomparable\", was chosen by founders Knapp and Martin since the terms invincible and incomparable are very masculine, but the term appears in the feminine form in Latin, and they thought it was a good description for women's MMA.\n\nAfter more than a year in the making, the promotion held its first event, on . It was headlined by a rematch between former Strikeforce women's bantamweight champion Marloes Coenen and French fighter Romy Ruyssen.

Liz Carmouche and Jessica Penne both received social media bonuses.\n\nOn June 9, it was announced that Invicta has formed a strategic partnership with Japanese promotion JEWELS to cross-promote the world's top female fighters on their respective fight cards in the United States and Japan.\n\nInvicta then held its second event () on July 28, 2012. Like the first event, it was made available as a free stream on the promotion's official website. The event was headlined by \n2004 Summer Olympics women's freestyle wrestling silver medalist Sara McMann and Shayna Baszler.\nCarla Esparza and Barb Honchak made their promotional debuts on this card. As part of the alliance with Japanese promotion Jewels, Jewels lightweight champion Ayaka Hamasaki was set to face undefeated Austrian fighter Jasminka Cive as part of the main event but Cive was unable to secure her visa in time and was replaced by Lacey Shuckman.\n\nOn September 24, 2012, Invicta announced a strategic alliance with the Super Fight League, which aims to bring the best Indian female fighters to Invicta, whilst Invicta will aim to send world class female mixed martial artists to the Super Fight League.\n\nSara McMann was originally scheduled to fight for the Invicta FC Bantamweight Championship at Invicta FC 3 but this did not occur due to an injury to McMann.\n\nAlso at Invicta FC 3, Leslie Smith fought Kaitlin Young in a rematch from their exciting \"fight of the night\" Invicta FC 1 bout where they fought to a draw. This time, Smith was able to get the better of Young and defeated her by TKO in the second round. Invicta FC3 also saw the promotional debut of long time Women's Bantamweight and Flyweight standout Tara LaRosa, as well as the debuts of Michelle Waterson and Cat Zingano. Fight of the night bonuses went to Michelle Waterson and Lacey Schuckman. The submission of the night bonus was split between Jessamyn Duke and Stephanie Frausto while knockout of the night went to promotional newcomer Joanne Calderwood.\n\nOn December 19, 2012, Shannon Knapp announced Invicta FC 4 would air as an online pay-per-view.\n\nInvicta Fighting Championships held their fourth event () on January 5, 2013. The event was headlined by the inaugural Invicta FC Strawweight Championship bout between Carla Esparza and Bec Hyatt (in Hyatt's promotional debut). Esparza was originally scheduled to fight Ayaka Hamasaki for the title but Hamasaki pulled out of the fight due to commitments to defending her JEWELS lightweight title. Hamasaki was originally replaced by undefeated Brazilian fighter Claudia Gadelha but on December 28, Gadelha was also forced to withdraw after suffering a broken nose in training. Esparza defeated Hyatt to become the first Invicta FC Strawweight Champion. Also Alexis Davis defeated Shayna Baszler in the card's fight of the night and Rose Namajunas won knock-out of the night in her professional MMA debut.\n\nDue to purchasing issues on the night of the event, the event was streamed for free rather than pay per view and it was announced that all buyers would be refunded.\n\nDuring Invicta FC 5, there were no issues with the Ustream pay-per-view system as there had been in January.\n\n took place on 13 July 2013, featuring the crowning of Cristiane \"Cyborg\" Justino as the inaugural Featherweight champion and a Strawweight title eliminator match won by Claudia Gadelha over Ayaka Hamasaki (previously unbeaten JEWELS lightweight champion). The winner will face champion Carla Esparza. The card also featured wins by Jessica Penne, Lauren Taylor, Tecia Torres, Leslie Smith and Joanne Calderwood.\n\nThis event was aired on cable and satellite pay-per-view in the United States and Canada in addition to their online PPV stream, as the promotion had come to a deal with Integrated Sports Media for live viewing.\n\nIn early 2014 an agreement with the UFC was announced to air all future Invicta FC events exclusively on the UFC's subscription-based digital streaming service, UFC Fight Pass, and that the entire Invicta FC fight library would be added to the \"On Demand\" part of UFC Fight Pass. On July 10, Invicta and the UFC held a joint conference call to announce that Invicta FC 8 would be the first event to stream live on Fight Pass. The September 6th event was to be headlined by Michelle Waterson's first title defense of her atomweight belt vs. Yasuko Tamada.\n\nOn February 24, it was announced the partnership between Invicta and Combate. The deal allows the Brazilian channel the broadcast of Invicta live events as well the event library of Invicta in the South American country. The first Invicta event broadcast on Combate was showing the Brazilian Invicta's featherweight champion Cris Cyborg versus the Canadian challenger Charmaine Tweet.\n\nInvicta's current rules follows the \"Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts\" that were originally established by the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board and modified by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.\n\nIn January 2015, it was announced that the promotion had beaten the UFC by 4% of the community vote to win the \"2014 Best Promotion Award\" in the Awakening Fighters WMMA Awards.\n\n\n"}

One of Alchemy II's first projects was building the animatronic characters used on the television show \"Welcome to Pooh Corner\". Forsse and his team then brought Teddy Ruxpin to the marketplace. Teddy Ruxpin became the top selling toy of 1985 and 1986 and was made by Worlds of Wonder.\n\nIn 2005, Alchemy II made an agreement with toy manufacturer BackPack Toys to have Teddy Ruxpin back on the shelves yet again and the toy made a return in 2006 before being discontinued again in 2010.

{"id": "25805409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25805409", "title": "List of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien sketches", "text": "List of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien sketches\n\nThe following is a list of sketches which debuted on \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" on NBC.\n\nMany sketches originated on O'Brien's original show, \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and were carried over to, and continued on \"The Tonight Show\" during O'Brien's short reign.\nThe sketches include:\n\nIn this sketch, Conan is interrupted by an overzealous announcer (voiced by show writer Brian McCann) while lamenting the increasing number of celebrities who are using Twitter. The announcer attempts to prove to Conan that celebrity tweets are exciting by reading some of his favorites, which all describe mundane activities or are bland statements. Some examples include Ashton Kutcher reporting that he is going to the grocery store, and Jennifer Love Hewitt saying that the weather is beautiful.\n\nThe sketch is always accompanied by increasingly elaborate animations in which the bird from the Twitter logo is repeatedly killed. It also includes the announcer trying to persuade Conan to play a game by using a rhyming sentence in which he refers to him as CoCo. Past games have included Complete the Tweet, Trick or Tweet, and Beat the Tweet.\n\nOn Thanksgiving, \"The Tonight Show\" celebrated Tweetsgiving, during which the announcer read celebrity twanks (tweets that give thanks). Christmas and Chanukah-themed tweets were read during the holiday season. The Tweetsgiving game was \"Pilgrim or Pornstar?\", where Conan had to guess if the following tweet was by a pilgrim or a porn star.\n\nHaving acknowledged the higher profile that comes with being host of \"The Tonight Show\", Conan schemes to beat the paparazzi at their own game by photographing himself in embarrassing situations and selling the pictures directly to the tabloids. To manufacture these moments, Conan makes use of a green screen and some inexpensive props. Past moments have included Conan running over a bible salesman, stealing underwear from Barbara Walters, loading a corpse into the trunk of a car, and kicking babies at a playground (all while drunk).\n\nAs Conan discusses L.A.'s chronic traffic problems, he calls for a view from \"The Tonight Show\"'s traffic copter. The scene then shifts to a fake road filled with gridlocked toy cars. The cause of the traffic jam would always be something absurd, such as a dog celebrating its bar mitzvah, a marauding robot, or a giant Amy Winehouse passed out on the road. Based on a former sketch used on his previous show in similar fashion.\n\nAfter discussing something topical, Conan will present a video from Donald Trump. In the video, Trump divulges his plans as they relate to the topic. These plans always include constructing something ridiculously expensive, such as a parking space paved with imported marble or a resort on the moon.\n\nIn this sketch, Andy is given a product to test and review. Past products have included Bacon vodka, a flaming bra worn by Lady Gaga, and a skydiving simulator.\n\nOn one occasion, Andy was presented with a Tofurky and Gravy flavored Jones Soda. After refusing to try it, the sketch was renamed \"Just Shut Up and Drink It\" and the unpleasant task was passed along to LaBamba, who instantly gagged and regurgitated the beverage.\n\nAfter discussing an interesting news story, Conan would sometimes introduce a tangentially related guest who he would claim was appearing live via satellite. At the beginning of the interview Conan would often note the surprisingly good quality of the satellite feed or simply call the technology very expensive. In reality, the guest would actually be in front of a false wall or green screen just a few feet away from Conan and in full view of the studio audience. At the end of the interview, the guest would sometimes walk off camera while still in split-screen format and cross in front of Conan's camera, clearly demonstrating that he was there the whole time.\n\nWhile visiting a warehouse full of poor quality celebrity wax figures, Conan identified two as his favorite and purchased them. One was of Henry Winkler as his Happy Days character Arthur Fonzarelli (whose hand positioning caused Conan to comment that he had just finished up at the urinal), and the other was a creepy-looking figure of Tom Cruise. Both wax figures made several appearances on the show.\n\nIn addition to appearing in various places around the studio (such as at the urinal in the men's washroom), Wax Fonzie and Wax Tom Cruise were also spotted at the Los Angeles Lakers' 2009 NBA championship celebration and were incorporated into many recurring sketches on the show (such as an installment of \"Conan's Tabloid Moment\" where Wax Fonzie played a corpse and Wax Tom Cruise played a murderous accomplice).\n\nBoth figures were routinely placed in dangerous situations and sustained damage. Wax Tom Cruise was decapitated and dismembered while testing out Universal's skydiving simulator during an installment of \"Andy'll Try It\". Meanwhile, Wax Fonzie was stabbed while acting as Conan's assistant during a knife-throwing segment. Both figures later were shot out of circus cannons. Wax Tom Cruise emerged unscathed, but Wax Fonzie landed on his face and was horribly mangled. When he was brought out at a later date as part of a \"Prop Auction\" sketch, the audience audibly gasped in amusement at his appearance.\n\nWax Fonzie was last seen sitting in the car that was blown up at the conclusion of the \"Conan, Please Blow Up My Car\" contest, and was presumably destroyed after the explosion. Wax Tom Cruise was stationed nearby to say farewell.\n\nWax Tom Cruise eventually returned during an installment of \"America's New Oprah\" and was made to re-enact the real Tom Cruise's infamous couch-jumping incident. Toward the end of the Tonight Show controversy in January, Wax Tom Cruise was featured on Twitter in a picture, wearing a \"Team Conan\" shirt.\n\nAfter reaching significant milestones in his career, Conan would present a message he claimed was sent to him from his peers in the television industry. The message would consist of a series of clips from various news and talk shows that had been spliced together to create the message to Conan. The message would usually close by insulting either Andy or Max.\n\nAfter Conan says something respectful and thoughtful about senior citizens, he will receive a video rebuttal message from his dad. In the message, Conan's dad belittles Conan's achievements and describes him as insincere and uncaring. He also notes how Conan pales in comparison to his older brother. It is sometimes even suggested that Conan's brother has died as a result of Conan's stupidity.\n\nConan visits various businesses near the Universal Studios lot, poking fun at the bizarre establishments he finds. Past businesses have included a pornography studio, a tattoo parlor operated by a man named Freak Show, and a store that exclusively sells items decorated like the American flag.\n\nOn August 7, 2009, a remote piece aired featuring Conan's visit to a NBC/Universal Studios Gift Shop. During the filming of the remote, Conan interviewed a NBC employee by the name of Wing Pang. Conan was visibly impressed by the man's natural comedic timing and sincere personality and the focus of the remote shifted from the NBC store to Wing Pang, himself. Directly after the airing of the segment, Conan brought Wing Pang on stage and thanked him for his participation in the remote. Wing Pang went on to make two more appearances, the first of which aired on Nov. 5 which was another remote piece featuring an interview between Conan and Wing followed by a fencing match between the two. Wing's third and final appearance was on Nov. 26, which was another remote, this time featuring Conan's Thanksgiving dinner with Wing as well as Jordan Schlansky and Pierre Bernard.\n\nWhenever Max Weinberg goes on tour with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Conan will imply that Max must leave the show immediately in order to make his flight. The entire platform on which Max sits will then start moving as Max continues to drum. The motorized platform goes out into the street, presumably on its way to the airport. Various things might occur along the way, such as Max stopping at a drive-thru or Max being hit by a large truck.\n\nIn this sketch, Conan reveals that Max Weinberg has allowed a camera crew to follow him while touring in Europe with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Conan then decides to check and see what Max is doing at that particular moment. A stock footage clip of a person involved in an altercation with police is then shown. The intent is for the audience to believe this person is Max.\n\nWhen their studio was added to the Universal Studios Tour, Conan acknowledged that it could not compete with the other stops on the tour. In order to compensate for this, Conan and Andy would act out exciting scenarios as the tour passed the studio. Past scenarios have included Conan delivering Andy's baby and Conan curing Andy's paralysis.\n\nFeeling that those audience members seated at the back of the studio did not get as good an experience as those seated near the front in \"the Cone Zone\", Conan would arrange for some special entertainment in the back row. This entertainment was usually something underwhelming, such as a hamster race or a bodybuilder posing.\n\nInspired by a recent trip to Dodger Stadium, Conan introduces the concept of couples sharing a kiss when the camera settles on them. These sketches typically deviate from this standard formula by including several odd pairings, such as a hunter making out with a bear or a nerdy Harry Potter fan groping an imaginary woman.\n\nIn response to the immense popularity of Japanese anime, Conan and Andy went to the studios of Bang Zoom! Entertainment to record voiceovers for some of their films. These voiceovers consisted primarily of improvising comical dialogue based on literal interpretations of the scenes.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", Conan reports that one the film's main actors has let success go to his head. Footage of Albus Dumbledore (played by Brian Stack) harassing partygoers in Hollywood is then played.\n\nThroughout the video, Dumbledore uses many Harry Potter-themed innuendoes, such as asking women if he can Slytherin to their Gryffindor. At the end of each sketch, Dumbledore is either beaten or pursued by the police and his mug shot is displayed.\n\nAfter former Alaska governor Sarah Palin used flowery language during her resignation speech (and later on her Twitter account), Conan called on William Shatner to recite some of her most poetic statements in a dramatic, exaggerated fashion reminiscent of his musical career. During these sketches, Shatner would be accompanied by Mike Merritt on bass and Ronnie Gutierrez or James Wormsworth on bongos.\n\nDuring one installment, after Shatner had read from Palin's , Palin appeared and read from Shatner's autobiography (which includes a description of riding an elephant in his underwear).\n\nIn later occurrences, Shatner instead recited statements from Levi Johnston's Twitter account, which were crude and pointless rather than poetic.\n\nAfter mentioning that Oprah Winfrey is suing companies for using her name and image without permission, Conan claims to be a victim of similar unauthorized endorsements. He then shows a commercial made up of clips that were spliced together to give the impression he was endorsing a certain product (while making other inappropriate remarks). Conan would later admit that he would be okay with the endorsement if he was being paid for it.\n\nIn one installment, Max claimed to be a victim of unauthorized endorsements as well, only to later admit that his endorsement of a male enhancement cream was legitimate.\n\nConan gives his audience a Mini Dose of Joy by bringing out puppies that are wearing cat costumes. The sketch is accompanied by an annoyingly repetitive song. For Halloween, the sketch was changed to \"Puppies Dressed as Frankensteins\". For Thanksgiving, the sketch was changed to \"Puppies Dressed as Thanksgiving Dinner\".\n\n2009 proved to be a successful year for former President Bill Clinton and occasionally Conan would use a chart to illustrate fluctuations in his popularity. The chart consisted of a picture of Clinton and an arrow that was attached at his crotch. As positive statistics were presented, the arrow would thicken and elongate, simulating an erection. When negative statistics were presented, the arrow would shrink and shrivel up.\n\nIn this sketch, a PSA featuring Elmo would be shown, in which his voice had been dubbed over. While his human counterparts offered sincere advice to children regarding ways to prevent the spread of illnesses (such as Swine Flu), Elmo would announce that death was inevitable and instead urge children to make peace with their God or to stay home and smoke cigarettes.\n\nIn response to current events, the staff of the Tonight Show present a series of PSAs they have recorded. Following a pair of humorous messages from Conan and Andy, a third message is shown, which usually stars either Max or LaBamba. This final message features information that is just barely related to the subject matter being discussed. For example, Max recorded a Swine Flu PSA in which he suggested that everyone wear surgical masks, but only so women would have a harder time identifying him after he exposes himself to them on the subway. Similarly, LaBamba recorded an Environmentalism PSA in which he eats spaghetti from a dumpster and then simply shouts \"Environment!\" \n\nDue to the popularity of vampire-themed films and shows such as \"Twilight\", \"True Blood\", and \"The Vampire Diaries\", Conan hired a vampire assistant named Cody Deveraux. Stereotypically brooding and overly dramatic, Cody's appearance is always accompanied by melancholy emo music. The sketches always end with Cody fleeing the studio in despair after receiving some mildly upsetting information. Once outside, sunlight causes Cody to ignite, leaving only a pile of charred clothes on the sidewalk. After one such appearance (and subsequent death), Tonight Show announcer Andy Richter questioned Cody's ability to repeatedly die, only to later reappear unharmed. Cody's true fate was then revealed, as he was shown backstage drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette.\n\nIn later occurrences of the sketch, Cody becomes distraught upon learning that Conan has hired additional assistants based on popular films. This included hiring a zombie due to the popularity of \"Zombieland\", hiring an invisible presence due to the popularity of \"Paranormal Activity\", hiring a wolf boy due to the popularity of \"\", hiring a football player due to the popularity of \"The Blind Side\", and hiring a [Pandoran_biosphere#Naʼvi|[Na'vi]] after the success of \"Avatar\". Another assistant to appear alongside Cody was Frankenstein's monster (played by Brian Stack) from \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\".\n\nIn one skit, Jerry Springer was called in to break up a fight between Cody and Wolf Boy. When Cody inevitably committed suicide, Jerry followed suit, revealing that he, too, had been a vampire all along.\n\nConan takes the time to let his viewers know what is in and what is out for the coming season. The items that are out are usually a bizarre variation of a current trend, such as being touched by an iPod salesman rather than buying an iPod Touch.\n\nFollowing the release of \"The Wizard of Oz\" in High Definition, Conan complained that the film had been ruined. He then presented examples of scenes that had been worsened by the incredible level of detail. These scenes included things that had supposedly gone unnoticed in previous versions of the film, such as the Cowardly Lion's penis or a smoking munchkin.\n\nDuring a time when Los Angeles was experiencing light rain, Conan's commentary about the weather would be interrupted by updates from a weather reporter (played by Brian McCann). The weather reporter was often surrounded by individuals who reacted to the rain in extreme fashion, such as emergency crews, a robotic mop, and roving bands of warriors. The sketches were meant to exaggerate Los Angeles residents' fear of the rain.\n\nWhen the United States Forest Service released new ads featuring Smoky the Bear, Conan noted their aggressive tone and disturbing content. He then presented the ads, in which Smoky's voice had been dubbed over. In each installment, Smoky would confront someone who was being careless with fire and threaten to do terrible things to them, like bury them alive or bite off their genitals.\n\nInspired by a man who garned media attention for motorizing his recliner, Andy revealed that he'd motorized the podium from which he watches each episode. For the next few moments Andy would pilot his podium around the stage, often cutting in front of the camera and distracting Conan as he attempts to continue with the show.\n\nFollowing the announcement that Oprah Winfrey's talk show would be concluding in 2011, Conan dubbed himself the new Oprah and commanded his audience to buy obscure products. His recommendations included the 1974 made-for-TV movie \"Killdozer\", a calendar of extraordinary chickens, and an album of music from action film star Steven Seagal. Conan would later refer to the Amazon.com pages for these items to prove that customers had indeed been purchasing them together.\n\nOn one occasion, Max was called upon to provide relationship advice in the style of Dr. Phil. Max happily reminded viewers to ask prostitutes if they are actually cops before requesting services.\n\nOther past recommendations have included \"Cool as Ice\", several films from the \"Leprechaun\" franchise, \"Troll 2\", and a Christmas-themed VHS starring Kathie Lee Gifford (which was so terrible that Conan revoked his recommendation).\n\nAfter NBC had been purchased by Comcast, Conan would announce that no jokes would be made at his new employers' expense, opting instead to list the various accomplishments that made them worthy of respect. Andy, sometimes wearing Comcast merchandise, would offer similar sentiments. At the end of the sketch, LaBamba would usually be called upon to provide his opinion of Comcast, but would instead announce something childish and unrelated, such as \"I like pancakes!\" \n\nFollowing the revelation that Tiger Woods had been cheating on his wife with several different women, Conan insisted that he needed professional help to determine which of the numerous possible jokes he should tell with regards to Woods' infidelities. A caddy would then enter, carrying with him a golf bag full of cue cards. After evaluating the audience for things such as temperature and wind speed, the caddy would select a joke for Conan to read. Prior to the reading of the joke, Andy would comment on the situation in the hushed voice of a golf announcer.\n\nDuring one installment, Conan and his caddy were interrupted by Bob Saget, who appeared with his own joke caddy and asked to play through.\n\nIn the weeks leading to O'Brien's departure following a seven-month tenure, Conan began showing \"classic\" moments from their seven months at \"The Tonight Show\". The sketch was a joke, as a show usually runs for a number of years before it starts showing classic clips, rather than a few months, as was Conan's tenure as host. Such sketches included: when the wax figures of Tom Cruise and Fonzie were shot from a cannon, or Tom Hanks was hit with a meteorite. Conan asks why one of the vignettes in the opening shows him suffering a concussion.\n\nSaying that one of the staff members wants to share his thoughts about what is happening, Conan introduces writer Deon Cole, who described, in successive episodes, how Conan is a ho, a pimp, or black, asking Conan such questions as \"Has Charlie Sheen/Paris Hilton ever been on your couch?\" The routine ends with the word of the day (such as \"BLACK MAN\" or \"PIMP\") being stamped over Conan's face, similar to the \"Ass\" stamp.\n\nSaying, \"I do not know if I'm even legally allowed to do this, but screw it,\" Conan says he put \"The Tonight Show\" up for sale on Craigslist, and shows the \"real\" responses he received, and that these are real photos of what was offered, such as a 1970 AMC Gremlin, or someone's brother. No element of \"The Tonight Show\" was actually sold.\n\nDuring the final week of his Tonight Show tenure, Conan decided to unveil new characters that were designed to be more expensive than funny since NBC is required to pay for everything used in the show's segments. The first night, Conan introduced the 'Bugatti Veyron Mouse', an actual model of the car dressed in mouse whiskers and ears accompanied by the master recording of The Rolling Stones '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' at a purported cost of $1.5 million. In reality, the car was donated for use by the Petersen Automotive Museum, however NBC was forced to remove all web clips of the sketch from its website and Hulu in order to avoid paying the royalty fees for 'Satisfaction'.\n\nThe following night, Conan acquired 2009 Kentucky Derby winner Mine That Bird, dressed the horse in a mink Snuggie and\nhad it watch restricted NFL Super Bowl coverage at a purported cost of $4.8 million. Repeated viewings by internet viewers revealed though that the horse was similar looking stand-in and that the football footage shown was actually from the USFL.\n\nThe final show featured a purchased fossil of a ground sloth from the Smithsonian spraying an original Picasso with beluga caviar at a cost of $65 million. After this, Conan addressed the fact that internet users believed the purchases to be real, stating that they were all supposed to be obvious fakes.\n"}

In September 2010, it was announced that she competed on \"The Amazing Race 17\" with her father Gary Ervin. \"The Amazing Race\" was filmed in May and June 2010 and premiered on September 26, 2010. Gary and Mallory were also one of the teams to return for \"The Amazing Race 18\", which premiered on February 20, 2011. Ervin returned to the race to join Mark Jackson in \"The Amazing Race 24: All Stars\", after Jackson's teammate William \"Bopper\" Minton was deemed unfit to race.\n\nErvin won the title of Miss Kentucky on July 18, 2009, when she received her crown from outgoing titleholder Emily Cox.

{"id": "2733451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2733451", "title": "Observational comedy", "text": "Observational comedy\n\nObservational comedy is a form of humor based on the commonplace aspects of everyday life. It is one of the main types of humor in stand-up comedy. In an observational comedy act the comedian \"makes an observation about something from the backwaters of life, an everyday phenomenon that is rarely noticed or discussed.\" The humor is based on the premise of \"Have you ever noticed?\" (or \"Did you ever notice?\"), which has become a comedy cliché. \"Observational humour usually took the form of long monologues of personal narrative, and the punch-line was either hard to predict or never came.\"\n\nBritish comedians Richard Herring and Jo Caulfield wrote in an article that observational comedy \"essentially involves saying 'Did you ever notice?' and then recounting something that will hopefully be universally familiar, but that won't necessarily have been consciously noted by your audience. If it's too obvious an observation it won't be funny (Have you ever noticed how buses always come in threes? Yes.) and if it's too oblique then it won't hit home.\" Eddie Izzard noted that a comedian's observations \"need to be something that people can relate to, for the audience to pick up on it\" in order to be considered a successful observational comedy act. Douglas Coupland writes, \"Anybody can describe a pre-moistened towelette to you, but it takes a good observational comedian to tell you what, exactly is the 'deal' with them.\" He adds that observational comedy first of all depends on a \"lone noble comedian adrift in the modern world, observing the unobservable-those banalities and fragments of minutiae lurking just below the threshold of perception: Cineplex candy; remote control units.\"\n\nObservational comedy has been compared to sociology.\n\nObservational comedy became popular in the United States in the 1950s. Although one author suggests that it \"has never been particularly new. Even the more 'old-fashioned' jokes it supposedly replaced were often themselves disguised commentaries based on observing human nature.\" \nBesides, older writers and live readers and speakers as Mark Twain himself, making jabs at everyday common place matters appealing to their Public's common sense about little noticed characters and their actions, early but very few entertainers followed in pokes at individuals and situation comedy instead of creating them and mimicking sketches. One of them, who became outstandingly successful in America and mixed it like Twain's personal gab of common man's as perspective, with his own personal trademark as embodyment of America's quintessential folky hero as a plainsman, by noticing and pointing to Public as his accomplice in the observations, using their old country folk common sense as deadpan or jolly neutral denominator for the comic revelation punch unfolding which departed from the hitherto satirical, was Will Rogers. He used to make the witty disclaimer, \"I don't make jokes. I just watch the government, and report their activities.\" Shelley Berman was one of the pioneers in the field. David Brenner's \"brand of observational comedy became a staple for other standups\", like Jerry Seinfeld, who has been called \"the master of observational comedy\". Seinfeld's \"brand of accessible, refined observational humor largely defined 1980s comedy.\" A 1989 \"Los Angeles Times\" article wrote that Seinfeld is \"clearly the standard of excellence in observational comedy\", while Judd Apatow called Seinfeld \"the greatest observational comedian who ever lived\". George Carlin was a significant figure in observational comedy since the 1960s and influenced Seinfeld.\n\nThe British observational comedy tradition began with the Irish comedian Dave Allen's performances in the early 1970s.\n\nRichard Zoglin considers the term \"observational comedy\" misleading because it is not \"about politics or social issues or the comedian's own autobiography, but simply about everyday life.\"\n"}
{"id": "616984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=616984", "title": "Orquesta típica", "text": "Orquesta típica\n\nOrquesta típica, or simply a típica, is a Latin-American term for a band which plays popular music. The details vary from country to country. The term tends to be used for groups of medium size (about 8 to 12 musicians) in some well-defined instrumental set-up.\n\nIn Argentina, the term orquesta típica is associated with tango music. The orquesta típica usually comprises a string section (of violins, viola, and cello), a bandoneón section (of 3 or more bandoneons), and a rhythm section (of piano and double bass). An orquesta típica is an expanded version of a sexteto tipico, which includes 2 bandoneons, 2 violins, double bass and piano.\n\nIn Cuba a típica is an ensemble mainly composed of wind instruments. They have existed at least from the middle of the 19th century to the present day. One of the earliest, Orquesta Flor de Cuba, had the following make-up: cornet, trombone, figle (ophicleide), two clarinets, two violins, double bass, kettle drum, and güiro. The ophicleide was a sort of bass bugle with keys, invented in 1817, now superseded by the tuba and/or baritone horn, the name surviving for a pipe organ stop; the trombone would be more typically a valved rather than a slide instrument. See \"Early Cuban bands\" for more examples.\n\nTípicas were later superseded by charangas, which along with son conjuntos, were one of the main precursors of the salsa ensemble. A typical salsa conjunto might include two trumpets, trombone, double bass, piano, conga, bongó or timbales (and/or timbalitos) and a güiro (scraper).\n\n"}
{"id": "6543626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6543626", "title": "Palladium Ballroom", "text": "Palladium Ballroom\n\nThe Palladium Ballroom was a second-floor dance hall above a drug store at the corner of 53rd Street and Broadway in New York City. It became famous for its Latin music from 1948 until its closing on May 1, 1966.\n\nWhen the Palladium opened as a dance studio and dance hall, it had a racially restrictive policy and did not maintain the level of funding needed to operate. It had a dance floor that could hold a thousand couples but had fallen into decline by 1947. Most of the Latin bands were scheduled for the matinee session. Many were used as relief bands for the big society bands. Latin bands played at nightclubs such as The Conga, The China Doll, The Park Palace, and The Park Plaza in Spanish Harlem. \n\nThe Palladium needed capital to survive, so it opened its doors to whites, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans, and people of different races and origin; everyone was accepted. Private investors joined and attorneys from big law firms participated in this joint venture for their friends, including Lou Walters and Federico Pagani.\n\nIn 1948, dance promoter Federico Pagani approached his longtime friend Lou Walters, owner of the Latin Quarter, and stated that he wanted to open a nightclub across the street from the Latin Quarter and bring Latin music from Havana. They asked Max Hyman and his wife Ann, an heiress to the Otis Elevator Company fortune, about booking Latin music and representing Federico Pagani to manage the Palladium. Pagani was the first to start the Latin matinee in a downtown dance hall on a Sunday and Wednesday. The first booking, on that Sunday afternoon, was a huge success, quickly prompting the club to fill its schedule with Latin music. Among the top acts to appear at the ballroom were the band of Arsenio Rodríguez, whose band members included Arsenio's bassist Alfonso \"El Panameño\" Joseph, one of the most popular bands to perform at the Palladium; Machito (born Frank Grillo) and His Afro-Cubans, an established New York act, with music arranger and sax player Mario Bauzá, Machito's brother-in-law, and Graciela, Machito's sister, on vocals; and Tito Puente. He was responsible for bringing many stars from Havana, such as Orquesta Aragón, Desi Arnaz, César Concepción, Celia Cruz, Xavier Cugat, José Curbelo, José Fajardo, Marcelino Guerra, La Lupe, Sonora Matancera, Joseíto Mateo, Noro Morales, Benny Moré, Tommy Olivencia, Pérez Prado, Ismael Rivera, Daniel Santos, Miguelito Valdés, and Vicentico Valdés.\n\n\n\nIn 1948, the Palladium Ballroom gained in stature because of the Big Three acts: Tito Puente, Tito Rodríguez, and Machito. The Big Three grew in popularity on the strength of their bookings at the Palladium. These bands were turning out mambo hit after mambo hit such as \"Asia Minor\" and \"Babarabatiri\", \"Picadillo\" and \"Ran Kan Kan\", nad \"Mambo Mona\". The popularity of Dámaso Pérez Prado's \"Mambo No. 5\" (1952) was taking everyone by storm.\n\nThe Palladium was known not only for its music but for the its dancers, fueled by weekly dance competitions and pie contests along with a Female Best Leg Contest. Ability to dance, not class or color, was the social currency inside the club. The Palladium's top star-performers, Augie and Margo Rodríguez, took the mambo to unimaginable heights. Another popular act featured was the group The Mambo and Cha-Cha-Aces with Andy, Mike and Tina. Mike Ramos and Freddie Rios did their side by side act. Marilyn Winters danced the entire floor in her one-woman show, as did Carmen Cruz. The Palladium became a showcase for the chachachá, merengue, and the pachanga. These became as popular with the masses as the Mambo. \n\nThe year 1948 started the mambo craze that spread across the United States. It began at the Palladium Ballroom. At the height of its popularity, the Palladium attracted Hollywood and Broadway stars, especially on Wednesday nights, which included a free dance lesson. Dance instructors such as \"Killer Joe\" Piro — who briefly served as master of ceremonies at the Palladium when Federico Pagani was not available — Augie and Margo were featured dancers there. Cuban Pete and Millie Donay appeared all over the world. Tito Puente wrote a song for Cuban Pete. Carmen Marie Padilla would offer mass dance lessons for the huge crowds.\n\nThe Palladium was next jazz clubs on West 52nd Street such as Birdland, CuBop City, and the Onyx Club. Jazz musicians and some celebrities would sit in and play with the Latin bands. Others watched and enjoyed the show. Examples of notables who went to the ballroom include Count Basie, Marlon Brando, Dave Brubeck, Paul Desmond, Joe Morello, Sammy Davis Jr., Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, Gene Krupa, Jerry Lewis, Peter Lawford, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Buddy Rich, George Shearing, Cal Tjader, and Pedro Vargas. Saxophonist Wayne Shorter, who lived in the New York City area during the heyday of the Palladium Ballroom, composed a piece during the 1970s called \"Palladium\" while a member of the seminal jazz-fusion group Weather Report. The song appears on their \"Heavy Weather\" album and features a driving Latin rhythm.\n\nBy the early 1960s, tastes had shifted and it was clear a new sound was on the horizon. The Palladium closed its doors in the spring of 1966. Dancers' and music fans' enthusiasm for the music was not diminished. The Village Gate in Greenwich Village opened its doors to Latin Night on Mondays and Wednesdays. Federico Pagani started Latin Nights with radio host Symphony Sid Torin and Joe Gaines. Pagani started doing the same at Tony Roma's El Corso on 86th Street and Third Avenue, Barney Googles, and the Cheetah nightclub. These venues became the places \"the scene\" went to next. Pagani also was responsible for his input on the movie filming \"Nuestra Cosa\" (\"Our Latin Thing\" ) at the Cheetah and The Red Garder with Symphony Sid.\n\nThe dance floor and bandstand of the club were recreated in \"The Mambo Kings\" (1992), a film starring Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas about the era of the mambo at the Palladium Ballroom and about Federico Pagani. Roscoe Lee Brown played the part of promoter Fernando Pérez, who would listen to what one had to offer in music, could make or break candidates, and was very serious and honest in telling them whether or not they had a chance to make it. Tito Puente played himself, and Desi Arnaz Jr. played Desi Arnaz Sr. The Mambo Kings Band featured Ralph Irizarry, Machito's son Mario Grillo, and others. \n\n"}

It is a continuation of Zen Studios' pinball series, which includes \"Pinball FX 2\" and \"Zen Pinball 2\".\n\n\"Pinball FX 3\" allows players to play one of several simulated pinball tables, and includes online scoreboard support for informal competition with other players.. The game is aimed to provide a more engaging multiplayer experience than previous titles; the game will provide support for asynchronous competitive multiplayer options, and tournament-style play. There will be shared leaderboards and multiplayer options between PlayStation 4 and users playing through Steam on Windows, and similarly shared options for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch players with both Steam and Windows 10 users.\n\nZen's prior games have been split across consoles. The \"Pinball FX\" games typically have been for the Xbox 360 and Windows platform, while the \"Zen Pinball\" was for the PlayStation 3. \"Pinball FX 3\" will be a single title for all three platforms and for future games in the series. Zen has stated that a \"majority\" of the previous downloadable content pinball tables that a player has purchased for either \"Pinball FX 2\" or \"Zen Pinball 2\" will be available in \"Pinball FX 3\" at no cost; Zen cited issues with licensing that prevents some tables from being brought to the new version. Zen Studios has affirmed that more than fifty tables will carry over, with only about half a dozen that will not.\n\n\"Pinball FX 3\" launched with three new tables based on movie properties from Universal Pictures that includes \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", \"Back to the Future\", and \"Jaws\". Additional tables are in development with new intellectual property holders.\n\nA version for the Nintendo Switch was released in December 2017, with one free table and 29 additional tables that can be purchased as DLC. The Switch version takes advantage of the unit's portability; the game can be played in portrait mode and the player can tilt the device to simulate tilting of the pinball table. However, following release, players reported issues with low frame rates and poor graphics on some of the tables; while Zen Studios has said they were working on a patch to fix these as well as make other display improvements, the studio later announced in March 2018 that they had to forgo the patch citing that there was no universal fix as the issue was one done table-by-table; they can optimize tables going forward but could not justify the time and cost to fix the existing ones. Reacting on the negative backlash of this announcement, the studio later reverted on this stance and is now committed to releasing a performance update during summer 2018 that will increase handheld performance to 60fps and will raise docked resolution to 1080p Full HD for all existing tables.\n\nIn September 2018, Zen Studios announced that it has received the license to recreate several real Bally and Williams tables for the game.<ref name=\"Polygon Bally/Williams\"></ref> This marks the first time in the \"Pinball FX\" series that real world tables are recreated in the game. This announcement came a few months after FarSight Studios, the developers of \"The Pinball Arcade\", lost the same license. These tables can be played in two visual modes that otherwise do not impact the game: one based on the more realistic appearance of the actual pinball games, and another that added \"Pinbal FX 3\"s simulated elements like animated characters, and unique ball trail colors. However, as to retain the game's overall ESRB \"E10+\" rating and to avoid the cost and difficulties of re-rating the game, original graphical elements of the pinball tables had to be censored or altered, such as altering innuendo that was present on the \"Fish Tales\" backboards. Zen Studios' Mel Kirk said that while these tables had been released in \"The Pinball Arcade\" under its E10+ ESRB rating, Zen Studios' internal review believed that there was no way that the tables could have fallen within E10+. Kirk stated that he believed that with \"The Pinball Arcade\", \"somehow they flew under the radar and it was not caught\". Further, Zen Studios had had past issues with ESRB content ratings with games such as \"Infinite Minigolf\" and wanted to exercise caution. The first of these tables were released on October 9, 2018.\n\n\nThe game was nominated for the Central Park Children's Zoo Award for Best Kids Game at the New York Game Awards 2018, and won the award for \"Game, Special Class\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards.\n"}

Two common examples are \"PIN or VIN number\" (the \"N\" in PIN and VIN stands for \"number\") and \"ATM machine\" (the \"M\" in ATM stands for \"machine\"). The term \"RAS syndrome\" was coined in 2001 by \"New Scientist\". \n\nUsage of these redundant acronyms are advised against by many style guides, but they continue to have widespread usage in colloquial speech.\n\nOther nonce coinages continue to arise. Select examples of RAS phrases include:\n\nAlthough there are many instances in editing where removal of redundancy improves clarity, the pure-logic ideal of \"zero\" redundancy is seldom maintained in human languages. Bill Bryson says, \"Not all repetition is bad. It can be used for effect ..., or for clarity, or in deference to idiom. 'OPEC countries', 'SALT talks' and 'HIV virus' are all technically redundant because the second word is already contained in the preceding abbreviation, but only the ultra-finicky would deplore them. Similarly, in 'Wipe that smile off your face' the last two words are tautological—there is no other place a smile could be—but the sentence would not stand without them.\"\n\nA limited amount of redundancy can improve the effectiveness of communication, either for the whole readership or at least to offer help to those readers who need it. A phonetic example of that principle is the need for spelling alphabets in radiotelephony. Some instances of RAS syndrome can be viewed as syntactic examples of the principle. The redundancy may help the listener by providing context and decreasing the \"alphabet soup quotient\" (the cryptic overabundance of abbreviations and acronyms) of the communication.\n\nAcronyms and initialisms from foreign languages are often treated as unanalyzed morphemes when they are not translated. For example, in French, \"le protocole IP\" (the Internet protocol protocol) is often used, and in English \"please RSVP\" (roughly \"please respond please\") is very common. This occurs for the same linguistic reasons that cause many toponyms to be tautological. The tautology is not parsed by the mind in most instances of real-world use (in many cases because the foreign word's meaning is not known anyway; in others simply because the usage is idiomatic).\n\n"}

{"id": "41966639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41966639", "title": "The Last of Us: Left Behind", "text": "The Last of Us: Left Behind\n\nThe Last of Us: Left Behind is an action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released worldwide for the PlayStation 3 on February 14, 2014, as a downloadable expansion pack to \"The Last of Us\"; it was later bundled with \"The Last of Us Remastered\", an updated version of the game released for the PlayStation 4 on July 29, 2014, and was released as a standalone expansion pack for both consoles on May 12, 2015. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, players control Ellie, a teenage girl who spends time with her best friend Riley after her unexpected return.\n\n\"The Last of Us: Left Behind\" is played from a third-person perspective; players use firearms, improvised weapons and stealth to defend against hostile humans and zombie-like creatures infected by a mutated strain of the \"Cordyceps\" fungus. Players can use \"Listen Mode\" to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness. The game also features a crafting system, allowing players to customize weapons through the upgrades.\n\n\"The Last of Us: Left Behind\" was highly anticipated due to the critical success of \"The Last of Us\". It was acclaimed by many reviewers, with particular praise for its story, characterization, and depiction of female and LGBT characters. It won several year-end accolades from multiple gaming publications.\n\n\"The Last of Us: Left Behind\" is similar to the basic gameplay of \"The Last of Us\". It is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a cover system. Players control Ellie. An added feature in combat is the ability to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, by throwing objects to distract them. This results in a lower number of enemies to encounter, giving players a tactical advantage. Throughout the game, players encounter locations and activities around the mall, such as a carousel, photo booth, video arcade, mask store and water guns. All of these locations and activities have some level of interactivity, allowing players to use them in different ways; for example, the photo booth allows players to select different mannerisms in which to pose for a picture, while using the water guns prompts players to soak Riley.\n\nIn the aftermath of a fight that leaves Joel (Troy Baker) severely injured, Ellie (Ashley Johnson) searches an abandoned mall for supplies to heal him. She discovers a medical kit in a derelict military helicopter. Making her way back to Joel, Ellie is impeded by the Infected and members of a hostile human group. She fights her way back to the unconscious Joel, treats his open wound, and takes him to find a hideout for the coming winter.\n\nMonths earlier, before Ellie meets Joel, Ellie's friend Riley (Yaani King) surprises Ellie at their boarding school after weeks away. She reveals that she has joined the Fireflies, a revolutionary militia group, and takes Ellie to explore an abandoned shopping mall. Riley reveals that she has been assigned to a group of Fireflies in a different city, and broke the rules to see Ellie again. The girls argue, but Ellie eventually tells her that she supports her decision as it is something that Riley has wanted for a long time. Before parting, Riley plugs Ellie's walkman into the sound system and dances with her. Ellie tearfully begs Riley not to leave. Riley rips her dog tags off and Ellie kisses her. Drawn by the noise, the Infected pursue Ellie and Riley; they run, but are bitten. They consider suicide, but choose to spend their final hours together.\n\nNaughty Dog began developing \"The Last of Us: Left Behind\" following the release of \"The Last of Us\" in June 2013, with a team about half the size. Following the decision to create single-player downloadable content for the game, the development team immediately decided that the story would focus on the character of Ellie; they found that players of \"The Last of Us\" were interested to learn about events in Ellie's life prior to the events of the main game, particularly the events involving Riley Abel, whom Ellie mentioned in \"The Last of Us\". In addition, they found that some players were interested in the events that occurred between the Fall and Winter segments of the main game, in which Ellie cares for an injured Joel. This led to the team deciding to contrast these two events against each other, feeling it would help the story's pacing. Game director Bruce Straley said that the team felt the story justified the development of \"Left Behind\".\n\"Left Behind\" was written to focus on the relationship between Ellie and Riley, and to recount the events that defined their later personalities. Riley was chronologically introduced to Ellie in \"\", a comic book written by creative director Neil Druckmann and artist Faith Erin Hicks. The team used the comic as a reference point when developing the relationship between Ellie and Riley, becoming particularly interested in having the chance to see more of their relationship; Druckmann felt that they would not have developed \"Left Behind\" if \"American Dreams\" hadn't been written. Druckmann felt that the story of Joel and Ellie's relationship in \"The Last of Us\" dealt with survival, loyalty and love, and that Ellie and Riley's relationship in \"Left Behind\" deals with similar themes. Straley felt that the themes involve love, loss and devotion, pondering the extent that one goes to protect those one cares about. Ashley Johnson portrayed Ellie in \"Left Behind\", reprising her role from \"The Last of Us\". To portray Riley, the team cast Yaani King; Johnson has noted that it was interesting to act against someone different, and that King fit the role immediately. King felt intimidated to become part of a large project, and was worried about \"fit[ting] in\". The team found it interesting to tell the story of Riley, as players of \"The Last of Us\" were already aware of the effect that she had on Ellie; \"Left Behind\" sees Riley's behavior change Ellie, resulting in the latter's focus to fight in order to save those close to her. The team were also interested in Ellie's behavior around Riley; she is perceived as being more playful. In \"Left Behind\", Ellie and Riley share a kiss; the team explored omitting the kiss from the game, but felt that it was imperative to the story, and that it strengthened the relationship. Though initially he only felt that Ellie viewed Riley as an influence, Druckmann later considered her romantic appeal, and decided to explore the concept.\n\nWhile writing \"The Last of Us\", Druckmann had a general idea of the events that would shape Ellie's identity; when conceiving the story direction for \"Left Behind\", he found that these events were suitable. Druckmann felt that omitting the nature of the argument between Ellie and Riley, which took place prior to the events of the game, allowed players to draw their own conclusions. The team found various sections of the game interesting, such as the references to Facebook and Halloween, as the characters are unaware of their meaning.\n\nThe smaller time frame of development for \"Left Behind\" gave the team an opportunity to trial mechanics and ideas that they were unable to test on the main game. With the game's combat, an added feature was to allow players to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, allowing an easier escape. The gameplay was also more focused on the characters, as opposed to the combat, to allow players to relate to them more. The gameplay sequences were designed to contrast with other moments of Ellie's life; for example, the water gun fight with Riley is contrasted to the gunfights with enemies. The team found that creating some gameplay mechanics was a challenge, with even fewer combat scenarios in \"Left Behind\" than in \"The Last of Us\". The animation of the masks also presented a challenge, due to the number of joints; it took various iterations before the final design was implemented.\n\n\"The Last of Us: Left Behind\" was released worldwide for the PlayStation 3 on February 14, 2014 as a downloadable expansion pack to \"The Last of Us\". It was later bundled with \"The Last of Us Remastered\", an updated version of the game released for the PlayStation 4 on July 29, 2014. It was released as a standalone expansion pack for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 on May 12, 2015.\n\n\"The Last of Us: Left Behind\" was released to critical acclaim. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating in the 0–100 range, calculated an average score of 88 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 69 reviews. Reviewers praised the character development, story and subtext, gameplay and combat, and depiction of female and LGBT characters.\n\nTom Mc Shea of GameSpot found the story insightful, and IGN's Colin Moriarty named it one of the game's standout features. Matt Helgeson of \"Game Informer\" wrote that the writing \"shines\", and that it significantly assisted with the development of the characters. Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar felt that the story was \"intermittently intense, tragic, humorous, and even poignant\". \"Polygon\"s Samit Sarkar wrote that \"Left Behind\" \"serves as a terrific side story\" to the main game, but is \"even more impressive\" when taken on its own merits. Nick Cowen of \"Computer and Video Games\" found the story \"less satisfying\" than \"The Last of Us\" due to its lack of new details about Ellie, but declared it \"action-packed and enjoyable\" nonetheless.\n\nThe characters—particularly the relationship between Ellie and Riley—received acclaim. \"Polygon\"s Philip Kollar appreciated the game's ability to portray realistic female characters, noting that they \"aren't easy stereotypes\", while GameSpot's Mc Shea felt new appreciation for Ellie by seeing her actions around Riley. Helgeson of \"Game Informer\" welcomed the addition of Riley, noting that she is \"played with the same level of emotional depth and subtlety\" as other characters. \"The Daily Telegraph\"s Tim Martin praised the \"interplay\" between the Ellie and Riley, and Eurogamer's Stace Harman felt that the game improves the understanding of Joel and Ellie's relationship. The character performances also received praise, with IGN's Moriarty and Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton noting that the game improved as a result.\n\nThe game received some positive reactions in relation to its depiction of LGBT characters. The kiss shared by Ellie and Riley was described by Kotaku's Hamilton as \"video gaming's latest breakthrough moment\", declaring it \"a big deal\". Keza MacDonald of IGN wrote that the kiss was \"so beautiful and natural and funny that [she] was left dumbstruck\". Edward Smith of \"International Business Times\" felt that the kiss was \"the first example of intimacy in a videogame that's meant anything\", recognizing it as \"an expression of both burgeoning teen sexuality and of ... friendship\". Amplify, a project of the non-profit advocacy group Advocates for Youth, reported that the kiss had attracted criticism from some players.\n\nMany reviewers found the gameplay and combat a refreshing difference from other games. Eurogamer's Harman commended the game's ability to link the gameplay to the story, noting that it adds \"diversity and dynamism\". Helgeson of \"Game Informer\" praised the additional gameplay feature allowing players to force fights among the Infected and human enemies, naming such sequences \"engaging\", while Martin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" appreciated the game's ability to contextualize the combat sequences. However, some critics felt negatively about a gameplay sequence occurring late in the game, which requires players to kill a large number of enemies; GameSpot's Mc Shea noted that it felt \"unnatural\", and IGN's Moriarty called it \"forced\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s Eric L. Patterson wrote that players will feel \"disappointed\" if they play the game \"more for the gameplay than the story\".\n\nThe world and environments of the game drew acclaim from many reviewers. \"Polygon\"s Kollar called the game's locations \"beautiful\", while Eurogamer's Harman wrote that the level design significantly improved the environments. Moriarty of IGN praised the setting within the mall, due to its regularity in \"the real, pre-apocalyptic world\". Mc Shea of GameSpot also felt that the game's focus on exploration allowed the \"well-realized environments [to] breathe\", and Martin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" noted that Ellie's body size allowed for \"quieter and faster\" movement throughout the environments.\n\n\"The Last of Us: Left Behind\" received multiple nominations and awards from gaming publications. Following its release, GameSpot awarded \"Left Behind\" Game of the Month for February 2014.

He was sometimes referred to as the \"Father of Vaudeville\". The strongest elements of his entertainments were an almost jingoistic brand of United States patriotism and a strong commitment to attracting a mixed-gender audience, the latter being something revolutionary in the male-oriented variety halls of the mid-century.\n\nA collection of his papers is maintained at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas in Austin, and in the archives of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.\n\nAfter his Spanish father (Antonio Pastor) came to New York and met his future wife Cornelia Buckley, from New Haven, Connecticut, they lived in Manhattan. Their third child, and first son, Antonio Pastor, was born in Manhattan on May 28, 1837, at his parents' residence at 400 Greenwich Street, in what is now the financial district of lower Manhattan. His father was a Spanish immigrant who supported his family as a barber and part-time musician.\n\nPastor embarked on a show business career at a very young age, obtaining a job singing at P.T. Barnum's Scudder's American Museum. During the next few years he worked in minstrel shows, the circus business, and as a comic singer in variety revues. He established himself as a popular songwriter during a four-year run at Robert Butler's American Music Hall, a variety theater located at 444 Broadway in what is now called Soho but was then the heart of the lower Manhattan theater district. Pastor published \"songsters\", books of his lyrics which were sung to popular tunes. The music had no notation, as it was assumed that the audience had a collective knowledge of popular song. The subject matter of his music was intended to be bawdy and humorous.\n\nThough Pastor was popular with the nearly all-male variety theater audiences, he knew that his ticket sales would double if he attracted a female audience. Soon he began to produce variety shows, presenting an evening of clean fun that was a distinct alternative to the bawdy shows of the time and more appropriate for middle-class families. In 1865 Pastor opened Tony Pastor's Opera House on the Bowery in partnership with minstrel show performer, Sam Sharpley, whom he later bought out. The same year he organized traveling minstrel troupes who toured the country annually between April and October. With shows that appealed to women and children as well as the traditional male audience, his theater and touring companies quickly became popular with the middle classes and were soon being imitated.\n\nIn 1874, Pastor moved his company a few blocks to take over Michael Bennett Leavitt's former theater at 585 Broadway. The theater district was moving uptown to Union Square, however, and in 1881 Pastor took a lease on the former Germania Theatre on 14th Street in the same building that housed Tammany Hall. He alternated his theater's presentations between operettas and family-oriented variety shows, creating what became known as vaudeville. His theater featured performers such as Ben Harney presenting a new style called \"ragtime\" as well as other up-and-coming talents such as Weber and Fields, George M. Cohan, Sophie Tucker, Lillian Russell, Buster Keaton, Gus Edwards, Eva Tanguay, Blossom Seeley, Benny Fields, May Irwin and Eddie Leonard. Harry S. Sanderson was his business manager from 1878 until 1908. The business records from this period are available to researchers.\n\nIn the musical Hello, Dolly!, the song \"Put On Your Sunday Clothes\" includes the line, \"We'll join the Astors at Tony Pastor's\". It also references seeing \"the shows at Delmonico's\", which suggests that the character does not really know about upper class social life in New York.\n\nTony Pastor died in Elmhurst, New York on August 26, 1908 and was interred in the Cemetery of the Evergreens, in Brooklyn. He was 71, and though greatly mourned at his death as one of the last gentlemen of the early vaudeville halls, the medium had passed him by with the advent of the vaudeville circuit in the 1880s. Pastor had remained a local showman in an epoch that increasingly came to be dominated by regional and national chains. Fighting against the monopolies for the rights of individual local showmen was an undertaking that marked the last years of his life, earning him the nickname of \"Little Man Tony\".\n\nAccording to the humor of the time, Pastor wrote several songs that negatively portrayed ethnic stereotypes, such as \"The Contraband's Adventures\", the story of a freed slave. After the slave is set free by Union soldiers, he attends an anti-slavery meeting where the abolitionists try to scrub off his dark pigment. The slave concludes by singing...\n\nFor he never was intended for a white man.<br>\nDen just skedaddle home-leave de colored man alone;<BR>\nFor you're only making trouble for de nation;<BR>\nYou may fight and you may fuss<BR>\nBut you never will make tings right<BR>\nUntil you all agree for to let de nigger be<BR>\nFor you'll neber, neber, neber wash him white! \n\nThough he separated some ethnic groups in his music, he also intended to unite the lower and middle classes. In songs like \"The Upper and Lower Ten Thousand\", he defended the common man of the Bowery:\n\nAnd with thousands of dollars of others make free<BR>\nShould he get into court, why, without any doubt,<BR>\nThe matter's hushed up and they'll let him step out.<BR>\nIf a Lower-Ten Thousand chap happens to steal,<BR>\nFor to keep him from starving, the price of a meal,<BR>\nWhy the law will declare it's a different thing-<BR>\nFor they call him a thief, and he's sent to Sing-Sing! \n\n"}
{"id": "14099209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14099209", "title": "Unseen character", "text": "Unseen character\n\nAn unseen character in theatre, comics, film, or television, or silent character in radio, is a character referred to but not directly known to the audience, but who advances the action of the plot in a significant way, and whose absence enhances their effect on the plot. The concept does not apply to the non-visual medium of literature, where all characters are unseen by the reader.\n\nThe portrayal of an unseen character may vary depending on the form of media. In visual media such as film, stage or television, an unseen character may sometimes be partially depicted as body parts or an offscreen voice, but is still considered unseen as long as their face is never revealed.\n\nUnseen characters have been used since the beginning of theatre with the ancient Greek tragedians, such as Laius in Sophocles' \"Oedipus Rex\" and Jason's bride in Euripides' \"Medea\", and continued into Elizabethan theatre with examples such as Rosaline in Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\". However, it was the early twentieth-century European playwrights Strindberg, Ibsen, and Chekhov who fully developed the dramatic potential of the unseen character. Eugene O'Neill was influenced by his European contemporaries and established the absent character as an aspect of character, narrative, and stagecraft in American theatre.\n\nUnseen characters are causal figures included in dramatic works to motivate the onstage characters to a certain course of action and advance the plot, but their presence is unnecessary. Indeed, their absence makes them appear more powerful because they are only known by inference. The use of an unseen character \"take[s] advantage of one of the simplest but most powerful theatrical devices: the manner in which verbal references can make an offstage character extraordinarily real [...] to an audience,\" exploiting the audience's tendency to create visual images of imaginary characters in their mind.\n\nIn a study of 18th-century French comedy, F. C. Green suggests that an \"invisible character\" can be defined as one who, though not seen, \"influences the action of the play\". This definition, according to Green, would rule out a character like Laurent (Lawrence), \"Tartuffe's\" unseen valet, whose sole function is merely to give the playwright an opportunity to introduce Tartuffe.\n\nUnseen characters can develop organically even when their creators initially did not expect to keep them as unseen, especially in episodic works like television series. For instance, the producers of \"Cheers\" and \"Frasier\" initially did not want to make the character Niles Crane's wife Maris an unseen character because they did not want to draw parallels to Vera, Norm Peterson's wife on \"Cheers\". They originally intended that Maris would appear after several episodes, but were enjoying writing excuses for her absence so eventually it was decided she would remain unseen, and after the increasingly eccentric characteristics ascribed to her, no real actress could portray her.\n\n\nUnseen characters occur elsewhere in drama, including the plays of Eugene O'Neill, Tennessee Williams, and Edward Albee. Author Marie A. Wellington notes that in the 18th-century, Voltaire included unseen characters in a few of his plays, including \"Le Duc d’Alençon\" and \"L’Orphelin de la Chine\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26463618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26463618", "title": "Émilie (opera)", "text": "Émilie (opera)\n\nÉmilie is an opera – specifically a 9-scene, 75-minute monodrama for soprano – by Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho (b. 1952) to a libretto by Amin Maalouf. It was written in 2008. Based on the life and writings of Marquise Émilie du Châtelet (1706-1749), the work premiered at the Opéra de Lyon, France, on 1 March 2010, with Finnish soprano Karita Mattila, its dedicatee. It recounts the achievements of the mathematician, physicist, and mistress of Voltaire: the first woman to establish an international scientific reputation, with pioneering work in the study of fire.\n\nThe opera \"Émilíe\" is based on the actual biography of Émilie du Châtelet, who was a contemporary intellectual to, as well as the mistress of, Voltaire. She also took another lover later who fathered her child. The childbirth led to her death. In the plot of the opera, her character's arias are linked to the birth of the child and of her significant scholarship. The soprano soloist is seen in character pregnant and penning new ideas as the opera begins. The subject of the work depicted in the opera was an actual French translation of technical writing in \"Eléments de la philosophie de Newton\" (1738). Though her French translation of what is also known simply as \"Principia by\" Isaac Newton was published posthumously in 1759, it remains a definitive text. Châtelet died 10 years prior to its publication. Composer Saariaho uses creative license to dramatically and sonically set the two births for solo soprano in a historical monodrama.\n\nThe context of women characters and roles in operas from the 17th century to the present rarely address their role as scientists or scholars, not to mention childbirth, making this composition and performance an intervention that expands the genre as studied in new or feminist musicology. Émilie is one of three \"female-centered operas\" by Saariaho exhibiting a sonic world that feminist musicologist Susan McClary opines as \"a 'sensual version of modernism,' one in which 'smoldering intensities' of desire find voice.\"\n\nSince Châtelet was actually tutored in mathematics by leading European scholars and her exceptional skills were thought to influence Voltaire's work, the scenery in the 2008 Opera de Lyon production of the opera featured images of mathematical equations as significant aspects of the set and scenery for the monodrama.\n\nReviews dubbed it a \"blue-stocking monodrama about the tension between intellect and nature.\" Billed as the third opera by Saariaho, Emilie is more accurately a sister-piece to the oratorio La Passion de Simone (2006). The actual score is accessible online.\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}
