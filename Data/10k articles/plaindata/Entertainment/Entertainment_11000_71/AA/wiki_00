Starring Jennifer Garner, the film was produced by Revolution Studios for Columbia Pictures, and was released on April 23, 2004. It follows a 13-year-old girl who dreams of being popular. During her birthday party, she is humiliated by classmates and wishes that she was 30 years old. When she eventually does emerge, she finds herself five days shy of her 30th birthday, uncertain how she got there.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising Garner's performance and its nostalgic environment. It was also praised for its humorous plot and self-empowering message. The film was also a commercial success, earning $22 million in its first week and grossing over $96 million, becoming one of the year's biggest-selling DVD rental titles. Its soundtrack features songs spanning from the 1980s to the 2000s, with a range of hits from famous recording artists such as Talking Heads, Billy Joel, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Pat Benatar and Whitney Houston. Additionally, the soundtrack charted inside the top 50 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. Garner's acting earned her nominations from both the MTV Movie Awards and the Teen Choice Awards, and the film was also re-released in DVD in 2006 as \"Fun and Flirty Edition\", and on Blu-Ray in 2009.\n\nOn May 26, 1987, Jenna Rink, a gawky girl, yearns to be popular, but the only way she can get the ruling clique—the \"Six Chicks\", led by mean girl Lucy \"Tom-Tom\" Wyman—to attend her upcoming 13th-birthday party is by doing their homework. Jenna's best friend, the geeky boy Matty Flamhaff (with the nickname of Beaver because he looks like the star of \"Leave It to Beaver\"), arrives early to the party to give her a bright pink, dream dollhouse that he built for her. He sprinkles his second gift, a packet of glittery \"magic wishing dust\", on its roof.\n\nThe Six Chicks soon show up with the cutest boys in class and make Jenna play \"seven minutes in heaven\". While Jenna waits, blindfolded, in a dark closet, thinking a popular boy she has a crush on is about to enter, the Six Chicks vanish with all the boys, half the food and Jenna's completed homework. It is Matt who walks into the closet, to Jenna's horror. She locks herself in the closet and cries, wishing to be 30; above her, the glittering wishing dust from the dollhouse gently rains down.\n\nThe next morning, Jenna awakens in a gleaming Fifth Avenue apartment. Jenna's dream has come true: It is now 2004, and Jenna, at first utterly baffled, particularly by the handsome hunk in her shower, realizes she has magically turned 30 overnight, with no idea of what happened in the intervening 17 years.\n\nJenna discovers that she works for \"Poise\", her favorite fashion magazine. Tough-as-nails Lucy is her co-editor and best friend, but the magazine itself is in serious trouble, having been scooped by a rival magazine named \"Sparkle\" so often that the editor-in-chief believes someone inside \"Poise\" is tipping them off. Jenna, freaking out like the frightened teen she still is, wants only to find Matty. She gets his address and races down to Greenwich Village where the now-grown Matt (Mark Ruffalo) is a struggling photographer. To her confusion, he is distant and cold, and cannot even fill Jenna in on much of her missing past, because she became head of the \"Six now seven Chicks\", and never spoke to Matt again. She even became Prom Queen—and Lucy, her only friend, is actually the original \"Tom-Tom\" after plastic surgery.\n\nWhile delighting in her freedom and great clothes, Jenna stumbles through a grown-up world, learning enough of life to advise other 13-year-olds whom she actually prefers to hang with. But her slowly emerging past reveals she was nothing like the sweet, shy girl she had been the day before: this grown-up Jenna stole ideas, refuses to speak to her parents, and has office sex with the husband of a co-worker. After Jenna overhears her supposed best friend Lucy badmouthing her, in a plan to save the magazine behind her back, she decides to fix the sins of the past she cannot remember.\n\nShe returns to her hometown in New Jersey and weeps in the same basement closet. Her parents find her there, and they hug. She gets back in touch with Matt, gingerly apologizes and hires him to do the photography on her own new plans for \"Poise\", which is a huge break for him. Even though Matt has a fiancée in Chicago who is eager for him to move there, Jenna and Matt begin to fall for each other.\n\nEveryone loves Matt's photos and Jenna's new plans to save the magazine, but when \"Sparkle\" shows up yet again with this exact material, including Matt's own photographs, and with Lucy as their new head, \"Poise\" folds. Outraged, Jenna confronts Lucy for stealing, but Lucy scornfully tells her that Jenna was the one sabotaging her own magazine all along; Lucy merely found out about it and did the same thing.\n\nMatt, wounded by what he thought was Jenna's betrayal of him, is getting married the next day. Jenna rushes out to the leafy suburb on his wedding day, hoping to convince Matt that she was not the person she had seemed to be, that he would marry her if he could see who she really was, but Matt, already in his tuxedo, says the past cannot come back and hands Jenna her pink homemade dollhouse, which he had kept all these years. While the wedding begins in the background, Jenna leaves in tears, closing her eyes and clinging to the dollhouse—on which a few bits of wishing dust still remain.\n\nWhen Jenna opens her eyes, she is back in 1987, on that same 13th-birthday night with a second chance. This time, when Matt finds her huddled alone in the closet, she kisses him. They run upstairs together, bumping into Tom-Tom on the way; Jenna rips up the homework in Tom-Tom's hands and Jenna and Matt run out of the house, emerging—presumably in around 2004 again only with Jenna having this time travelled the intervening 17 years normally—as a wedding couple on the other side of the door, and, as credits roll, they are moving into a bright pink house just like the dollhouse that started it all.\n\nIn October 2002, American director Gary Winick was in negotiations to direct \"13 Going on 30\". It was also announced that Susan Arnold and Donna Arkoff Roth were producing the project with the writers' manager, Gina Matthews. On May 13, 2003, it was reported that filming for the movie was underway in Los Angeles on Revolution Studios. It was filmed in Los Angeles, California, New York City, and South Pasadena, California. Interiors shots were filmed in Los Angeles. The crew moved to New York City, where they shot exteriors for 17 days. Principal photography took place from May to November 2003. Written by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, the script was \"polished\" by Niels Mueller (who lost an initial writing credit in a subsequent dispute arbitrated by the Writers Guild of America).\n\nAmerican actress Jennifer Garner was cast for the movie's lead role. In order to film the picture, Garner shot it while on break from filming her TV series \"Alias\". Gwyneth Paltrow, Hilary Swank, and Renée Zellweger were all considered for the lead role. Judy Greer was cast to play Lucy, Garner's best friend; Kathy Baker and Phil Reeves were invited to be Garner's mother and father, respectively. Later, Andy Serkis was selected to play Garner's boss; while Samuel Ball was announced as Garner's boyfriend. Christa B. Allen, who portrayed 13-year-old Jenna, later \"reprised\" her role as a younger version of Jennifer Garner by portraying the teenaged version of Jenny Perotti in \"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\". In October 2016, it was announced \"13 Going on 30\" is going to Broadway in late 2017.\n\nThe \"13 Going on 30\" soundtrack was released on April 20, 2004 from Hollywood Records. The album mostly contains music from the 1980s, but there is a handful of songs performed by contemporary artists, such as Lillix and Liz Phair. It was released on April 20, 2004 by Hollywood Records.\n\n\n\nThe songs \"Breathe\" by Michelle Branch and \"Iris\" by the Goo Goo Dolls were featured in promotional trailers, but were not featured in the movie or on the soundtrack.\n\n\nThe film opened on April 23, 2004, with an initial box office take of US$22 million in its first weekend, debuting at number 2, almost tied with Denzel Washington's thriller \"Man on Fire\". In its second week, it dropped to number 3, earning US$10 million. In its third week, it fell to number 5, earning US$5.5 million. In its fourth week, it took sixth place with an estimated $4.2 million. In its fifth week, it only fell to number 7, with an estimated $2.5 million. In its sixth week, the film fell to number 9, earning $1 million. It ended with nearly $60 million at the domestic box office. The same picture became one of the five biggest DVD rentals of the year, with over $57 million in rentals alone according to the Internet Movie Database. The film's success on DVD granted it a re-release (The Fun and Flirty Edition) in 2006 with special packaging. The picture grossed $96,455,697, going on to become one of the year's biggest DVD rentals and sellers. The Blu-ray version of \"13 Going on 30\" was released on January 20, 2009.\n\nThe film received an approval rating of 65% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 158 reviews. Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a very positive review with a grade of \"A-\", writing \"13 Going on 30 is the rare commercial comedy that leaves you entranced by what can happen only in the movies.\" Gleiberman also praised Jennifer Garner's performance, writing: \"She cuts out all traces of adult consciousness, of irony and flirtation and manipulation, reducing herself to a keen, goggle-eyed earnestness that's utterly beguiling.\" Joe Leydon of \"Variety\" also praised her performance, writing \"Garner throws herself so fully and effectively into the role that in a few key scenes, she vividly conveys Jenna's high spirits and giddy pleasure through the graceful curling of her toes.\" Leydon praised the director Gary Winick for \" bringing a fresh spin to most of the script's cliches and emphasizing nuggets of emotional truth provided by Goldsmith and Yuspa.\" Wesley Morris of \"The Boston Globe\" wrote that \"The movie is tailor-made for women who openly lust for dream houses, dream jobs, and dream hubbies.\" He also wrote that \"the best stuff involves the childhood preamble. (The young actors playing Jenna, Matt, and Lucy are terrific.) Those moments feel painfully, comically true.\"\n\nClaudia Puig of \"USA Today\" gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, commenting, \"This romantic comedy is intended as a cautionary fairy tale. The silly humor works with the movie's gentle message of self-empowerment and avoids sappiness in a tender interlude where the adult Jenna returns to her childhood home. Amusing, charming and pleasantly nostalgic, 13 Going on 30 should fall easily onto moviegoers' wish lists.\" It is written: \"This shameless rip-off of the Tom Hanks Classic \"Big\" is weak, but predictable and is sparked by the excellent performance of Jennifer Garner\".\n\nElvis Mitchell of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"The performances give the movie more flavor and life than the situation does; it often feels like prechewed Bubble Yum. The message of the plot is that a lack of sophistication is the key to success, even at a fashion magazine that attracts readers through sexy exhibitionism. The movie would have shown some daring savvy if it had played more with the role-playing aspect of fashion spreads. Instead it is content to eat its retro snack cake and have it, too.\" Andrea Gronvall of the \"Chicago Reader\" wrote that \"The formula works, thanks in large part to star Jennifer Garner, who's so radiant theaters should be stocking sunblock. Underlying the shenanigans and the pop-psychology moral—self-love is a prerequisite for true love—there's a touching wistfulness about roads not taken.\" Jorge Morales of \"The Village Voice\" commented: \"The thirtysomething in me was all, gag me with a spoon, but the kid in me was like, this movie's rad to the max.\"\n\nGarner was nominated for MTV movie and Teen Choice awards for her role as Jenna Rink.\n\n\n \n"}

Since, they have left the classroom and released a second game, \"\".\n\nSteffen Kabbelgaard (actual CEO) started to look at talented people to create a company and start making games. He found Kenneth Harder (actual CTO) with whom he gathered a team of 4 people to start the company. The team quickly grew up to 8 members within a few months.\n\nThrough a lack of money to have an office, the newly founded Betadwarf team moved illegally into an unused classroom in Aalborg University in Copenhagen, Denmark. All members of the team left their apartments to live in this classroom that they accommodated with fridges, beds and microwave ovens. There, they worked on their first game, which would become \"Forced\".\nFor 7 months they lived in this classroom until a lecturer of the University accidentally walked in on them. They were forced to move out and found a house in Karlslunde that they transformed into their new company office and in which they lived in.\n\nWith no more funds, they decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign for \"Forced\". The campaign didn’t originally start successfully. But, an image posted on Imgur, which described their history and progress as a team, was seen more than a million times and drew many people to the campaign which was successfully funded up to $65,413.\n\nThe BetaDwarf team then moved into an office in Copenhagen in which they continued to live in.

{"id": "4298473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4298473", "title": "Big Mutha Truckers", "text": "Big Mutha Truckers\n\nBig Mutha Truckers is a racing video game developed by British studio Eutechnyx. Set in fictional Hick County, the game revolves around completing trips between cities, delivering goods, and competing in races while at the helm of an eighteen wheeler. The game is available on GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PC, but enjoyed only mediocre critical and commercial success due to repetitive gameplay, dated graphics, and lackluster sound. The game uses Steppenwolf's \"Born to Be Wild\" as its theme song. The sequel is \"Big Mutha Truckers 2\". A different game of the same name was developed by Italian company Raylight Studios and released for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS.\n\nThe game's plot revolves around one of four available characters and their quest to inherit the family business. With plans to retire from the family business, Ma' Jackson challenges her four children, Cletus, Earl, Rawkus, and Bobbie-Sue, to a \"Trial by Truckin\". She gives each sibling 60 days in which to make deliveries to various cities in Hick State County, with the company going to the sibling with the most money in the end.\n\nBig Mutha Truckers is primarily a racing game, in the same vein as . Players spend the majority of their time on the road, navigating the highways between the game's six cities: Salt Sea City, Capital City, Greenback, Skeeter's Creek, Smokestack Heights, and Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated. The player will earn most of his or her money through trade, shipping goods from cell phones to beer, with additional opportunities from mini-games and challenge races.\n\nEvery city features three locations: a garage, a bar, and a store. The garage allowed players to repair damage, refuel, switch trailers to carry different kinds of cargo, buy upgrades to improve their rig, or design custom logos for their truck. In the bar the player can find tips on where to buy and sell certain cargo, and a loan shark. The store allows the player to buy and sell goods, with prices varying by town. When visiting Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated, the bar and store are replaced by visits to Ma Jackson.\n\nOn the road, the player can earn extra money by smashing other vehicles. This money can be multiplied through combos, or by hitting a vehicle with the trailer. If the player earns a high enough combo, he can make reward icons appear on the road. When collected, these icons can refuel the truck, repair damage, or offer a cash bonus. Law enforcement and biker gangs are both present in the game, and cause trouble for the player if he or she attacks them by mistake. Any cop will pursue and capture a player, while bikers will attempt to shoot up the trailer, or even detach it from the truck. In either case, it is a significant blow to the player's cash. Every cop in this game can be avoided with skillful driving, and bikers can be shaken away from your truck.\n\nOccasionally, the player will be asked to accomplish a side-mission when he or she visits a bar. These simple point-to-point races are good for cash if the player can complete them.\n\nBig Mutha Truckers has a mixed reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 66.41% and 62 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 65.36% and 63 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 65.35% and 59 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 56% and 48 out of 100 for the DS version; 55.80% and 61 out of 100 for the PC version; and 50% for the Game Boy Advance version.\n\nGameSpot critic Alex Navarro gave the game a 6.2 out of 10 rating, noting that while it \"earnestly tries to be a fun game,\" flaws in the presentation and a lack of varied gameplay lead to a game that \"as a full-on purchase . . . just doesn't measure up.\" Similar complaints about the game's commerce model came from Andy Mahood of GameSpy, who wrote that \"no matter how much you dress it up . . . this lather-rinse-repeat cycle can turn stale after only a few hours of play.\" Despite negative commentary, though, many reviewers admitted that the game was enjoyable, if only for the first eight to ten minutes.\n\n"}

The expansion included ponds, slides and a pony ride track. In 1987 additions were made including bouncy castle, trampolines, bumper boats and quad bikes. The park became known as Pixieland Fun Park. In 1997 a steam train replaced the diesel train and in 2000 the name of the park was changed to Brocklands Adventure Park.\n\nThe park itself was split into two parts with the main road dividing the rides to the south and the indoor activities, kids outdoor activities and cafe to the north of the road.

VII c. 30). It was the first primary legislation in the UK which specifically regulated the film industry. It is notable for having unintentionally provided the legal basis for film censorship, leading to the establishment of the British Board of Film Censors in 1912. \n\nDuring the 1890s and 1900s, most film exhibition took place in temporary venues such as fairgrounds, music halls and hastily converted shops (so-called 'penny gaffs'). The film then in use was made from the highly flammable cellulose nitrate base. Combined with limelight illumination, this created a significant safety hazard, resulting in a number of fatal fires.\n\nThe 1909 Act specified a strict building code which required, amongst other things, that the projector be enclosed within a fire resisting enclosure. All commercial cinemas (defined as any business which admitted members of the public to see films in exchange for payment) had to comply with these regulations. In order to enforce this each cinema had to be inspected and licensed by the local authority. The Act was amended in the wake of the 1929 Glen Cinema Disaster in order to give local authorities more powers to regulate the number of emergency exits and insist on other safety measures.\n\nIn the following year, the owner of the London Bridge Picture Palace and Cinematograph Theatre, in South London, was prosecuted under Section 2 of the Act after he defied a condition of the licence issued by the local authority, the London County Council, by opening on a Sunday (27 February 1910). In the appeal hearing which resulted, the cinema owner argued that the intention of the 1909 Act was simply to ensure health and safety, and that authorities had no legal power to attach unrelated conditions to cinemas' licences. The LCC won the appeal, which established the precedent that the purpose of restrictions on a cinema licence did not have to be restricted to fire prevention.\n\nIn the aftermath of this case, local authorities across the country began to censor the content of films, using their licensing powers under the 1909 Act. This concerned the film industry, which was worried that inconsistent censorship policies would undermine it: under this ad hoc system, a film-maker had no way of knowing the size of his potential market (i.e. how many authorities would allow or ban his film), and cinema owners in areas with strict censorship policies would suffer financially compared to those in more liberal towns.\n\nThe result was the creation of the British Board of Film Censors in 1912, a private company which examined and certified films according to nationally agreed criteria. It was financed by the fees paid by film-makers to the BBFC to have their films examined. Councils began to issue cinema licences with a provision stating that they may show only films which had been passed by the BBFC, rather than censoring films themselves.\n\nAlthough the Act itself was later superseded, its provisions remain the legal basis on which the content of films for cinema exhibition is regulated in the UK. There are occasionally high-profile cases in which a local authority overrules a BBFC decision within its given jurisdiction, either to raise the certificate or ban outright films the Board has passed, or to allow screening of films it has not. The BBFC was given statutory powers for the first time in 1985, when it was designated as the classifying authority under the Video Recordings Act 1984, in respect of most commercial video recordings sold or hired in the UK. But these powers do not affect theatrical exhibition, the legal regulation of which remains with local authorities.\n\n"}
{"id": "437990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=437990", "title": "Conkers", "text": "Conkers\n\nConkers is a traditional children's game in Britain and Ireland played using the seeds of horse chestnut trees—the name 'conker' is also applied to the seed and to the tree itself. The game is played by two players, each with a conker threaded onto a piece of string: they take turns striking each other's conker until one breaks.\n\nThe first mention of the game is in Robert Southey's memoirs published in 1821. He describes a similar game, but played with snail shells or hazelnuts. It was only from the 1850s that using horse chestnuts was regularly referred to in certain regions. The game grew in popularity in the 19th century, and spread beyond England.\n\nThe first recorded game of Conkers using horse chestnuts was on the Isle of Wight in 1848.\n\nThere is uncertainty of the origins of the name. The name may come from the dialect word \"conker\", meaning \"knock out\" (perhaps related to French \"conque\" meaning a conch, as the game was originally played using snail shells and small bits of string.) The name may also be influenced by the verb \"conquer\", as earlier games involving shells and hazelnuts has also been called \"conquerors\". Another possibility is that it is onomatopoeia, representing the sound made by a horse chestnut as it hits another hard object, such as a skull (another children's \"game\", also called conkers, consists of simply throwing the seeds at one another over a fence or wall). Conkers are also known regionally as \"cheesers\". Although a \"cheeser\" is a conker with one or more flat sides, this comes about due to it sharing its pod with other conkers (twins or triplets). Also \"Cheggers\" was used in Lancaster, England in the 1920s. In D. H. Lawrence's book \"Sons and Lovers\", the game is referred to as \"cobblers\" by William Morel.\n\n\n\n\nThe hardest conkers usually win. Hardening conkers is often done by keeping them for a year (aged conkers are called \"laggies\" in many areas or \"seasoners\" in Ireland and Liverpool), baking them briefly, soaking or boiling in vinegar, or painting with clear nail varnish. Such hardening is, however, usually regarded as cheating. At the British Junior Conkers Championships on the Isle of Wight in October 2005, contestants were banned from bringing their own conkers due to fears that they might harden them. The Campaign for Real Conkers claimed this was an example of over-regulation which was causing a drop in interest in the game. In both the World Conker Championship and the North American Championship, contestants are also restricted to using the conkers provided by the Organisers.\n\nOne factor affecting the strength of a conker is the shape of the hole. A clean cylindrical hole is stronger, as it has no notches or chips that can begin a crack or split.\n\nA similar Puerto Rican game (played with the smaller seed of the jatobá, \"Hymenaea courbaril\") is called \"gallitos\" (meaning small roosters or cocks, as in cockfighting). The opponents face each other and the defending gallito is laid in the center of a circle drawn in the dirt. Not until the attacking player misses will the defending player take a turn. Upon missing, if the attacking player is quick enough, they will try to swing at the defending gallito before the defendant removes it from within the circle. If the defending gallito is struck it must remain in the circle until the attacker misses again. This move is called a \"paso de paloma\".\n\nIn 1965 the World Conker Championships were set up in Ashton (near Oundle) Northamptonshire, England, and still take place on the second Sunday of October every year. In 2004, an audience of 5,000 turned up to watch more than 500 competitors from all over the world. The 2016 Championship was featured on the BBC programme \"Countryfile\".\n\n1976 was the first time that a non-British contestant won the Men's World Conker Championship. The Mexican Jorge Ramirez Carrillo took the place of a contestant who was unable to arrive on time at Ashton, and defeated the 1975 champion at the finals. The Men's champion has been British in every other year except 1998, when Helmut Kern from Nauort, Germany, won.\n\nIn 1999 the Irish Conker Championships began in Freshford, County Kilkenny in Ireland.\n\n2000 saw the first Ladies' champion from outside the UK. Selma Becker, originally from Austria, took the title. The title of Queen of Conkers has remained in the UK, except in 2001 when Frenchwoman Celine Parachou won.\n\n2001 Eamonn Dooley from Freshford in Co. Kilkenny, Ireland broke the world record by smashing 306 conkers in one hour.\n\nIn 2004 an alternative World Conker Championships was first hosted at Pill Harriers Rugby Club, Newport, Wales. This championship, known as the World Annual National Conker Championships, has been held every year since and is sanctioned by Dogfish Promotions. Contestants from America, Italy, England and Wales have taken part. \n\nThe North American Conker Championship was inaugurated on 20 October 2012 at the Historic Gardens in the town of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, Canada, hosted by the Annapolis Royal Conker Club.\n\nThe first North American Conker Champion was Jeff Hafting, of Annapolis Royal, NS.\n\nThe 2013 North American Championship was similarly held on the third Saturday, 19 October, and the eventual winner of an all-female Final was Krystyna Schulz of Halifax, NS.\n\nVictor of the 2014 North American Championship was Julian Smith of Yarmouth, NS.\n\nIn 2015 the Championship took place on 17 October, once more hosted at the Historic Gardens in Annapolis Royal. The coveted Crofton Chalice was almost regained by Jeff Hafting, the Inaugural 2012 Champion, but he lost in the Final to Simon Bonnington of Granville Ferry, NS. This saw the return of the trophy to its home in Annapolis Royal.\n\n2016 saw the Championship won by Elizabeth Mount of Bear River, NS. In the final bout she beat Oliver Bonnington, son of the 2015 Champion.\n\nRemarkably the 2017 final was a re-match of the previous year as Oliver Bonnington once again tried to beat Elizabeth Mount. It was not to be, and Elizabeth became the first North American Champion to retain the Title. \n\nIn the 2018 Championship on 13th October, Mount was eliminated in the first round; the eventual Champion that year was Amanda Carson of Kingston, NS, who defeated Rikarda Albright.\n\nPrior to this recent re-emergence, it had been played during the late 1940s and early 1950s in New York in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, and in the 1950s and early 1960s in the Amalgamated section of the Bronx and nearby Mt.Vernon. A winning chestnut was referred to as a \"killer\" and the value of a chestnut was defined by its number of \"kills.\" It was also played in Queens, the upper West Side of Manhattan, in the Mohawk Valley area of upstate New York and in Westmount, Quebec and other English-speaking parts of Montreal into the 1970s. It was played in the Catholic areas of North Cambridge, MA in the late 1950s, and a winning chestnut was also labeled a \"killer\". It was being played in the 1960s in Rhode Island. and into the early 1980s in Smithfield, RI.\nThe game was also played in Leicester, Massachusetts in the late 1970s and into the 1980s (and presumably much earlier, given the town's age and predominantly English/Irish settlers) by the children of the Primary School of the town (typically 4th and 5th graders). Leicester's seat of government (\"town hall\") was a dual use building, serving as both town hall and school. There is a large horse chestnut tree located on the town's common (and adjacent to town hall) that was used as a source for the chestnuts. The Leiecester variant on the name for the game was \"Horse Cobblers\"(presumably a variant of \"Horse Conkers\").\n\nIn 2000 a survey of British schools by Keele University showed that many were not allowing children to play conkers, as head teachers were afraid of the legal consequences if children were injured while playing the game, or because they thought that the conkers might be used as weapons. The TV programme \"Top Gear\" later staged a game of conkers using caravans (travel trailers) suspended from cranes. After putting on safety goggles, presenter James May commented \"I now feel perfectly happy about being hit in the face by a caravan.\" \"Top Gear\", along with other media commentators, wrongly stated that the wearing of goggles during the game was due to an official Health and Safety Executive (HSE) edict when it was in fact due to a myth which started when a headmaster bought goggles for children to use as a parody of health and safety regulation and sponsored a Conkers tournament.\n\nIn 2004, several schools banned conkers due to fear of causing anaphylactic shock in pupils with nut allergies. Health advisers said that there were no known dangers from conkers for nut-allergy sufferers, although some may experience a mild rash through handling them.\n\n\n\n"}

Many restaurants are open late and most of the bars stay open until dawn. It contains offices, accommodation, tourist shopping, entertainment, food, art and buskers offering many genres of free performance. Pedestrian traffic is substantial around the clock.\n\nThe first building of any importance in Courtenay Place was built shortly after 1900 by local butcher and businessman, John Rod JP. It is now a heritage listed building, originally designed by T S Lambert, situated on the eastern corner of Allen Street and Courtenay Place. Of brick construction, it originally had three stories and a large cellar, with stables at the rear (now 23 Allen street). It has since been reduced to two stories, probably due to earthquake damage. In 2015, the ground floor and cellars accommodate a bar and restaurant.\n\nEvery two years Courtenay Place is home to many of the New Zealand International Arts Festival events.\n\nBats Theatre is a venue for the development of new theatre practitioners and plays.\n\nDownstage Theatre, founded in 1964, is New Zealand's first professional theatre.\n\nEmbassy Theatre \"The Lord of the Rings\" movie \"\" had its world premiere at the Embassy Theatre at the head of Courtenay Place. The movies \"\" and \"\" both had their Australasian premiere at the Embassy (Event Slide Shows). Both events were broadcast live to the world for many hours, involving the movement of record amounts of data by CityLink. The theatre is on the Wellington City Council's heritage list in the District Plan. Heritage New Zealand has recognised its heritage values with Category One registration, indicating a place of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'. It was originally known as the 'De Luxe' and was built in 1924. Designed by Llewellyn Williams and constructed of reinforced concrete, it included classical external and internal architectural details. The name changed to the Embassy in 1945. A long list of theatre identities has been associated with the theatre, including William Kemball, who formed the De Luxe Theatre Company in 1923, and Sir Robert Kerridge. Kerry Robins, leaseholder of the Paramount Theatre in Wellington, took over the lease of the Embassy in 1996. It was purchased by the Embassy Theatre Trust in 1997 with financial underwriting of the refurbishment programme by Wellington City Council. Ownership was transferred to the WCC under the terms of the agreement. Embassy Theatre Trust subsidiary Company Financial report: Audit report In October 2005 Wellington film exhibitor Kerry Robins sold the operational management of the Embassy to Village SkyCity Cinemas.\n\nParamount Theatre (no longer operational) is the oldest surviving cinema in Wellington, still with its original name. Originally a part of Te Aro beach, in August 1916 the location of the Paramount was purchased by John James Williamson. He arranged for architect James Bennie to design a picture house.\n\nReading Courtenay Central Complex contains shops, restaurants and a ten-screen multiplex cinema. The 8,000 m² development links Courtenay Place with the waterfront and was designed to complement the existing character of the strip. This project won the 2003 Property Council NZ Entertainment Excellence Award. The site was originally bulldozed in the mid-1980s by Chase Corporation for the proposed Wakefield Centre, but after the company fell victim to the 1987 sharemarket crash, the site remained derelict for years until it was purchased by Reading Cinemas. The complex was temporarily shut down for safety reasons, after a large earthquake in late 2016 damaged an adjacent parking building beyond repair.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision (aka NZ Film Archive) is on the corner of Ghuznee St and Taranaki St, a block from Courtenay Place.\n\nThe Opera House\n\nSt James Theatre. Formerly His Majesty's (and more recently the Westpac St James Theatre), the St. James was designed for John Fuller and Sons Ltd by Mr Henry Eli White Architect, structural engineer and contractor. It was the first steel-framed concrete-coated proscenium-arched theatre in the Southern Hemisphere. The steel frame allowed for an unsupported 80 ft (25 m) span roof structure and also provided good resistance to earthquake damage.\n\nIn July 2011, Positively Wellington Venues, an integration between the Wellington Convention Centre and the St James Theatre Trust, began managing this theatre as well as The Opera House, Wellington.\n\nThere are two other theatres that sit just outside the Courtenay Place district, Circa Theatre which sits on the waterfront near Te Papa; and Capital E, home of the National Theatre for Children, which is in Civic Square.\n\nIn 2017, TEDxWellington hosted 13 speakers and 1,000 delegates at the St. James Theatre on Courtenay Place.\n\n"}

The organization's services are available 24 hours a day every day, throughout the US by texting 741741 or Canada by texting 686868.\n\nAs of October 26, 2018, Crisis Text Line has processed 86 million text messages.\n\nThe text line is notable among hotlines for its triage system, in which conversations are assessed by an algorithm for severity and queued accordingly.\n\nCrisis Text Line was conceptualized as a result of Do Something's mobile interactions with its members. Do Something CEO Nancy Lublin states that as members increasingly sent deeply personal text messages, she saw a need for a separate channel for these messages in order to better assist the young people sending them. In public appearances, Lublin specifically cites a series of texts reading \"He won't stop raping me... It's my dad.\" as an impetus for creating Crisis Text Line.\n\nThe service was given a quiet launch in August 2013 through a text message to Do Something members in Chicago and El Paso, and was soon being used by texters in every United States area code. Today, 350 people text the service daily, most of whom discovered the service through word-of-mouth.\n\nIn July 2015, it was announced that Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile would be waiving fees for use of the service, and that texts to Crisis Text Line would not appear on billing records.<ref name=\"re/code\" group=></ref> Publicity for the move, including a high-profile blog post by Richard Branson, prompted AT&T to follow suit. Each mobile carrier omits the texts to the hotline from billing records to avoid alerting abusive family members.\n\nIn September 2015, Crisis Text Line announced via the Do Something blog that it would be taking steps to become a resource for people who are Deaf or hard of hearing. A text message to the service reading, \"I can't call suicide hotlines because I can't hear, so I was hoping I could use this service\" was mentioned as an inspiration for this announcement. Specifically, the blog post mentioned accessible training for Crisis Counselors, and creating education around working with Deaf texters.\n\nChief Data Scientist Bob Filbin was highlighted in The Chronicle of Philanthropy as one of their 40 Under 40 for his work using data to inform Crisis Text Line's efforts. Speaking about the difference between Crisis Text Line's corpus and other mental health data, he said, \"This is people in their greatest moment of crisis. Most of the other data on mental health and crisis is survey data, which is collected after the fact. It’s people remembering.\" \n\nIn March 2017, Crisis Text Line announced that it was now offering its service via Facebook Messenger. Messenger would be the third channel of communication between texters and crisis counselors, after SMS and Kik. .\n\nCrisis Text Line exchanged its 50 millionth message with a person in crisis in October 2017, four years after its launch.\n\nCrisis counselors are all at least eighteen years old, and are selected through an application process. Once selected, they are required to submit a background check, complete thirty hours of training, and pass a final evaluation. Graduated crisis counselors commit to 200 total volunteer hours.\n\nIn order to ensure best practices and effectiveness in training, counseling, technological development, and organizational structure, Crisis Text Line consults with both a board of directors and an expert National Advisory Board.\n\nThe board of directors includes founder/CEO Nancy Lublin; danah boyd, Ph.D., the principal researcher at Microsoft research; and David Drummond of Google.\n\nDr. Shairi Turner was hired as the organization's first Chief Medical Officer in September 2017. According to a blog post from Crisis Text Line, \"Dr. Turner’s role will focus on ensuring continued delivery of high quality crisis support to texters and being a leading voice for the org’s primary goals: innovation and empathy.\" \n\nCrisistrends.org is a product of Crisis Text Line that, using data derived from the text messages received, compiles and provides information about crises in the United States. Describing potential uses of this data, Lublin told \"Glamour\", \"If you know anxiety peaks from 7:00 to 9:00 pm, schools could schedule their guidance counselors to be available then\".\n\nCrisistrends.org was launched in August 2014. Data on CrisisTrends.org are anonymized.\n\nIn late 2014, Chief Data Scientist Bob Filbin discovered that 3 percent of texters were using 34 percent of organization resources. \"Over the next six months, he helped find ways to identify them and move them on to services that could more effectively help them,\" reports \"Colgate Scene\". It was estimated that the change led to 24,000 additional texters helped in 2015.\n\nIn December 2015, Crisis Text Line made headlines by releasing data that implied that bullying and harassment against Muslims was on the rise. Lublin was quoted as saying, \"These political scare tactics have real implications on everyday Americans.\"\n\nCrisis Text Line experienced a noteworthy increase in volume immediately after Donald Trump's election as President of the United States. Specifically, the data revealed that \"election\" and \"scared\" were the words that overindexed most in the days after the election, and that the word \"scared\" was most frequently associated with LGBTQ texters.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Crisis Text Line's data about prom-related crises, noting that financial concerns were the most prevalent cause of prom-related conversations with the service.\n\nAnalysis of the service's data around military texters revealed that active duty service members and veterans make up 2.4% of texters, and that these texters are more likely to be struggling with suicidal ideation or substance abuse.\n\nLublin told Wired that the data are helping counselors by using keywords to predict the subject matter of a conversation. A profile reads: \"As the software analyzes incoming texts, it can send counselors targeted messages like, 'There’s a 99 percent chance this texter has a substance abuse issue. Here are three rehab programs within the texter’s area code.'\" \n\nIn 2016, Crisis Text Line launched enclave data, available to university researchers and research institutions. Interested researchers were able to apply for selective pulls of conversation data. Texters have the option to opt out completely of being included in this data. The program was discontinued in 2017 and relaunched in 2018 as Open Data Collaborations. \n\nCrisis Text Line has launched its service in Canada with affiliate Kids Help Phone, and the United Kingdom with Mental Health Innovations.\n"}

Sutherland III (April 4, 1949 – June 6, 2005) was an early \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (\"D&D\") artist. Sutherland was a prolific artist and his work heavily influenced the early development of \"D&D\".\n\nSutherland was born April 4, 1949 in Minneapolis, Minnesota and was a graduate of Minneapolis' Roosevelt High School. He trained as a commercial artist for two years at the Minneapolis Area Vocational Technical Institute before serving in the United States Army as a military police officer in the Vietnam War, serving in 1969–1970. After his return from the war, he began his career as a fantasy artist, while working odd jobs. His artistic talents were nurtured and developed by his father, a fellow artist. David C. Sutherland II worked in the paper industry and encouraged his son by bringing home creative materials and supplies.\n\nHe became involved with the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) in the early 1970s. He spent his free time drawing sketches and cartoons related to these pastimes.\n\nSutherland's involvement in game art began in 1974. After meeting Michael Mornard, a player in Gary Gygax' \"Greyhawk\" and then Dave Arneson's \"Blackmoor\" in the SCA, he was introduced to Professor M.A.R. Barker at the University of Minnesota in 1975. Barker was designing \"Tékumel\", an imaginary world for use with \"D&D\", published by TSR, Inc., the Wisconsin-based company that became the dominant publisher of role-playing games.\n\nThe professor put him in touch with TSR, and soon after, Sutherland was working for TSR. Sutherland worked with the \"D&D\" game's co-inventor, Gary Gygax, as part of a team of illustrators, including Erol Otus, Darlene Pekul, David Trampier, and others. Sutherland also worked as TSR's artistic director, but preferred working on his own illustrations. He worked at TSR until 1997 when the company was in the process of being purchased by Wizards of the Coast and he was not offered further employment.\n\nAfter his relationship with TSR ended, Sutherland found it difficult to find work and, according to friends, felt abandoned by the gaming industry. Recently divorced, Sutherland remained upset about the dissolution of his marriage, became despondent and his health began to fail. An auction of Sutherland memorabilia—including artwork, miniature sculptures, games, and game memorabilia—was held in 2004, raising USD$22,000, used to set up a trust fund for his two daughters.\n\nHe died of chronic liver failure on June 6, 2005 in his home in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. He was buried on June 22, 2005 with full military honors at Fort Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He is survived by his two daughters, Susan and Heather, and his mother, sister, and brother.\n\n\n"}

Starring Basuki Djaelani, Ratna Ruthinah, Ali Joego, and Djauhari Effendi, it follows the romantic hijinks of a village girl who is taken to be a rich man's second wife. The film, produced by a Dutch-run company, is recognised as the first in which future \"father of Indonesian film\" Usmar Ismail was involved.\n\nAbu Bakar (Ali Joego) attempts to evict Amat after the latter falls behind on his rent, only to fall in love with Amat's beautiful daughter Aisah (Ratna Ruthinah). He says that she shall work as his maid, although he intends to make her his second wife. Rusli (Basuki Zaelani), Aisah's cousin and a manservant at Abu Bakar's home, discovers this plan and tells Abu Bakar's wife. Aisah is sent back to her village and Rusli, who has fallen in love with her, proposes.\n\n\"Gadis Desa\" was produced by the South Pacific Film Corp (SFPC), a film production house owned and run by the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, a continuation of the former colonial government of the Dutch East Indies. The film was directed by the former journalist Andjar Asmara, who had worked for SPFC since 1948. The film was adapted from a stage play he had written for the travelling troupe Dardanella in the early 1930s. He brought Usmar Ismail, a young journalist with whom he had previously discussed filmmaking, to the production as an assistant director. The two native men had limited creative input, serving more as acting and dialogue coaches. The Dutch cameraman, AA Denninghoff-Stelling, held more power over the final product.\n\n\"Gadis Desa\" starred Ali Joego, Ratna Ruthinah, Basuki Zaelani, and Djauhari Effendi. All had had theatrical experience: Joego had been a member of Dardanella with Andjar, Ruthinah and her husband Zaelani –making their feature film debut – had been members of the Matahari touring troupe, while Djauhari had been active in the theatre during the Japanese occupation beginning seven years earlier.\n\n\"Gadis Desa\" was released in 1949, followed by a novelisation in 1950. Although he does not record its box-office performance, the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that the film's dated plot was reflective of a Dutch belief that native audiences would prefer unsophisticated comedy. A 35 mm copy is kept at Sinematek Indonesia.\n\nThe film proved Andjar's last as a director; he resigned from SPFC before its next production, \"Tjitra\" (1949), and spent the rest of his film career as a screenwriter. Ismail would go on to become two films for SFPC, \"Tjitra\" and \"Harta Karun\" (1949), and, after the Netherlands recognised Indonesia's independence, he established himself as the \"father of Indonesian film\" with \"Darah dan Doa\" (1950). SPFC would produce four further films before being dissolved in 1949.\n\n"}

To walk, the machine lifts 3 of its legs forward while pushing the remaining 3 legs backward against the ground in an alternating cycle. The system is designed in such a way that it can seamlessly adjust its direction of movement based on the rotation of the drive section located at the center of the machine. As of 2010, the robot had no onboard power system in place yet and during initial testing had to be tethered to external power sources.\n\nFabrication of the full-scale robot began in 2007 and intermittently continued until December 2010 when an initial and short \"Test Drive\" was taken.

In the 20th and 21st century traditional music and popular music such as blues, swing, jazz, jazz fusion, rock and metal guitar solos often contain virtuoso techniques and varying degrees of improvisation. Guitar solos on classical guitar, which are typically written in musical notation, are also used in classical music forms such as chamber music and concertos.\n\nGuitar solos range from unaccompanied works for a single guitar to compositions with accompaniment from a few other instruments or a large ensemble. The accompaniment musicians for a guitar solo can range from a small ensemble such as a jazz quartet or a rock band, to a large ensemble such as an orchestra or big band. Unaccompanied acoustic guitar music is found in folk and classical music dating as far back as the instrument has existed, and the use of an acoustic guitar as a solo voice within an ensemble dates back at least to the Baroque concerto.\n\nThe classical guitar (also called the Spanish guitar) is an acoustical wooden guitar with six strings, usually nylon, as opposed to the metal strings used in acoustic and electric guitars. Classical guitar is typically played by plucking individual strings with the fingernails or, rarely, the fingertips. A classical guitar solo concert is typically called a recital; it may include a variety of works, e.g. works written originally for the lute or vihuela by composers such as John Dowland (b. Ireland 1563) and Luis de Narváez (b. Spain c. 1500), and also music written for the harpsichord by Domenico Scarlatti (b. Italy 1685), for the baroque lute by Sylvius Leopold Weiss (b. Germany 1687), for the baroque guitar by Robert de Visée (b. France c. 1650) or even Spanish-flavored music written for the piano by Isaac Albéniz (b. Spain 1860) and Enrique Granados (b. Spain 1867). The most important composer who did not write for the guitar but whose music is often played on it is Johann Sebastian Bach (b. Germany 1685), whose baroque lute works have proved highly adaptable to the instrument.\n\nOf music written originally for guitar, the earliest important composers are from the classical period and include Fernando Sor (b. Spain 1778) and Mauro Giuliani (b. Italy 1781), both of whom wrote in a style strongly influenced by Viennese classicism. In the 19th century guitar composers such as Johann Kaspar Mertz (b. Slovakia, Austria 1806) were strongly influenced by the dominance of the piano. Not until the end of the nineteenth century did the guitar begin to establish its own unique identity. Francisco Tárrega (b. Spain 1852) was central to this, sometimes incorporating stylized aspects of flamenco's Moorish influences into his romantic miniatures. This was part of late 19th century mainstream European musical nationalism. Albéniz and Granados were central to this movement; their evocation of the guitar was so successful that their compositions have been absorbed into standard guitar repertoire.\n\nSome classical guitarists play concertos, which are solos written for performance with the accompaniment of an orchestra. Not many classical guitar concertos have been written, however, which may perhaps be laid to the imbalance between the volume of multi-instrumental orchestra as compared to a single guitar. Nevertheless, some guitar concertos are nowadays wide known and popular, especially Joaquín Rodrigo's \"Concierto de Aranjuez\" (with the famous theme from 2nd movement) and \"Fantasía para un gentilhombre\". Composers who also wrote well known guitar concertos are: Antonio Vivaldi (originally for mandolin or lute), Mauro Giuliani, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Manuel Ponce, Leo Brouwer and Lennox Berkeley. In the 2000s, contemporary composers are increasingly writing guitar concertos.\n\nComposers of the Renaissance period who wrote for four course guitar include Alonso Mudarra, Miguel de Fuenllana, Adrian Le Roy and Guillaume de Morlaye. Some well known composers of the baroque guitar were Gaspar Sanz, Robert de Visée and Francesco Corbetta. From approximately 1780 to 1850, the guitar had numerous composers and performers including: Filippo Gragnani (1767–1820), Antoine de Lhoyer (1768–1852), Ferdinando Carulli (1770–1841), Francesco Molino (1774–1847), Fernando Sor (1778–1839), Mauro Giuliani (1781–1829), Niccolò Paganini (1782–1840), Dionisio Aguado (1784 – 1849), Luigi Legnani (1790–1877), Matteo Carcassi (1792–1853), Napoléon Coste (1805–1883) and Johann Kaspar Mertz (1806–1856). Beginning in the 1920s, guitar soloist Andrés Segovia popularized the guitar with tours and early phonograph recordings. Modern classical guitar solo performers who are known for playing modern repertoire include Leo Brouwer, John Schneider, Reinbert Evers, Maria Kämmerling, Siegfried Behrend, David Starobin, Mats Scheidegger, John Williams, and Magnus Andersson.\n\nEven though guitar solos are used in a wide range of genres, the term \"guitar solo\" often refers to electric guitar solos played in blues and in rock. Unlike acoustic guitars like the classical guitar or steel-string guitar, the electric guitar is played through a guitar amplifier to make the instrument loud enough. Guitar amplifiers also have preamplifier and tone controls, and in some cases, overdrive controls that modify the tone. The use of a guitar solo as an instrumental interlude was developed by blues musicians such as John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, and T-Bone Walker, and jazz like Charlie Christian. Ernest Tubb's 1940 honky tonk classic, \"Walking the Floor over You\" was the first \"hit\" recording to feature and highlight a solo by a standard electric guitar–though earlier hits featured electric lap steel guitars. Blues master Lonnie Johnson had also recorded at least one electric guitar solo, but his innovation was neither much noted nor influential.\n\nHowlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, and Jimmy Reed played in Chicago in a style characterized by the use of electric guitar, sometimes slide guitar, harmonica, and a rhythm section of bass and drums. In the late 1950s, a new blues style emerged on Chicago's West Side pioneered by Magic Sam, Buddy Guy and Otis Rush on Cobra Records. The 'West Side Sound' had strong rhythmic support from a rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums and as pefected by Guy, Freddie King, Magic Slim and Luther Allison was dominated by amplified electric lead guitar. Other blues artists, such as John Lee Hooker had influences not directly related to the Chicago style. John Lee Hooker's blues is more \"personal,\" based on Hooker's deep rough voice accompanied by a single electric guitar.\n\nThese and other blues guitarists inspired the appearance of many virtuoso blues rock fusion soloists, beginning in 1963 with Lonnie Mack's first major recordings. One such soloist, Jimi Hendrix, was a rarity in his field at the time: a black man who played psychedelic rock. Hendrix was a skilled guitarist, and a pioneer in the innovative use of distortion and audio feedback in his music. Through these artists and others, blues music influenced the development of rock music. Another important blues rock guitar soloist in the 1960s and 1970s was Eric Clapton, a white performer. In the early 1970s, the Texas rock-blues style emerged, which used guitars in both solo and rhythm roles (e.g., Stevie Ray Vaughan, a white performer).\n\nThe earliest rock guitar solos, as exemplified by popular recordings of Duane Eddy and Link Wray in the late 1950s, were relatively simple instrumental melodies. In the early 1960s, instrumental surf music represented a step forward in the sonic complexity of rock guitar melodies. In 1963, the dramatic, technically advanced electric guitar solo rose to the fore with Lonnie Mack's hit records, \"Memphis\" and \"Wham!\" (later covered by The Ventures, Stevie Ray Vaughan and others), and soon, with the advent of blues rock and psychedelic rock in the mid-late 1960s, became a characteristic part of rock music. Later still, guitar solos became a defining feature of the rock genre of heavy metal, in which most songs feature a solo. Metal solos often showcase the virtuosity of the guitarists, especially in metal styles that use shred guitar techniques for rapid playing of scales and arpeggios. Since the 1960s, electric guitarists have often altered the timbre of their guitar adding electronic guitar effects such as reverb, distortion, delay, and chorus to make the sound fuller and add harmonic overtones. Other effects used in solos include the wah pedal and the talk box.\n\nRock bands often have two guitarists, designated \"lead\" and \"rhythm\", with the lead player performing the solos and instrumental melody lines while the rhythm player accompanies with chords or riffs. In some cases, two guitarists share the lead role. Most rock music is based around songs in traditional forms. The main formal features are verses, choruses, and bridges. The guitar solo is usually the most significant instrumental section of a mainstream rock song. In other rock-related genres, such as pop and dance music, the synthesizer usually plays this role.\n\nIn classic verse–chorus form, it often falls between the second chorus and third verse. Extended guitar solos are sometimes used as a song’s outro, such as Christopher Cross' \"Ride Like the Wind\", Radiohead’s \"Paranoid Android\", Lynyrd Skynyrd’s \"Free Bird\", The Stooges' \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\", Pink Floyd’s \"Comfortably Numb\", Guns N' Roses’ \"November Rain\", Metallica’s \"Fade to Black\", Led Zeppelin’s \"Black Dog\", Journey's \"Who's Crying Now\", The Cult's \"Love Removal Machine\", The Beatles’ \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", .38 Special's \"Hold On Loosely\", The Rolling Stones’ \"Sway\", Pearl Jam’s \"Alive\", Red Hot Chili Peppers’ \"Dani California\", Cream’s \"White Room\", AC/DC’s \"Let There Be Rock\", Outlaws’ \"Green Grass and High Tides\", The Alan Parsons Project’s \"Eye in the Sky\" and Eagles’ \"Hotel California\".\n\nSolos can take place in the intro, such as \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" by Jimi Hendrix, \"Since I've Been Loving You\" by Led Zeppelin, \"One\" by Metallica, \"Lazy\" by Deep Purple, \"I Want It All\" by Queen, \"Johnny B. Goode\" by Chuck Berry, \"Don't Take Me Alive\" by Steely Dan, \"Raised on Rock\" by Scorpions and \"Wish You Were Here\" by Pink Floyd.\nThe use of guitar solos in hard rock and heavy metal was notable during the 1980s, when rapid-fire \"shredding\" solos were common; a virtuostic lead guitarist of a band might be more well-known than the singer. During this time, players began to use advanced harmonics techniques more widely. Later, guitarists who had developed considerable technical facility began to release albums with instrumental-only guitar compositions. Guitar solos in popular music waned in fashion in the middle 1990s, coinciding with the rise in popularity of nu metal and grunge. Nu metal differed significantly from previous sub-genres of metal and abandoned guitar solos altogether, except for a few rare lead fills here and there, whilst grunge did not wholly abandon solos and included them from time to time. Guitar solos likewise became less prominent in many pop and popular rock music styles; either being trimmed down to a short four-bar transition or omitted entirely, in a vast departure from the heavy usage of solos in classic rock music from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. Classic rock revival music heavily features soloing, along with classic rock bands that are still active as of 2018.\n\nOccasionally, a song contains a two-part guitar solo with both rhythm and lead guitar taking solos (e.g., \"Master of Puppets\" by Metallica), or dual solos with both lead and rhythm playing complementary solos—such as with Twisted Sister’s \"30\", Iron Maiden's \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", \"The Trooper\" or Megadeth's \"Mechanix\". Some rock bands use harmonized dual lead guitar solos as part of their signature sound, such as Wishbone Ash. This was first popularized by the Allman Brothers Band in their album \"At Fillmore East\".\n\nLike the electric guitar, the bass guitar is played through a specialized amplifier to make the instrument louder and provided control over tone. The bass guitar came into use in popular music in the 1950s. While bass guitar solos are not common in popular music, some bands include bass solos in some songs, particularly heavy metal, funk, and progressive rock bands. Some genres use bass guitar solos in most songs, such as jazz bands or jazz fusion groups. Bass solos are also common in certain styles of punk music. In a rock context, bass guitar solos are structured and performed in a similar fashion as rock guitar solos, often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections. While bass guitar solos appear on few studio albums from rock or pop bands, genres such as progressive rock, fusion-influenced rock, and some types of heavy metal are more likely to include bass solos, both in studio albums and in live performances.\n\nPlayer perform bass solos with a range of techniques, such as plucking or finger picking. In the 1960s, The Who's bassist, John Entwistle, performed a bass break on the song \"My Generation\" using a plectrum, though he intended to use his fingers—he simply couldn't drop the plectrum quickly enough. Many consider this one of the first bass solos in rock music, and one of the most recognizable. John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, on \"Good Times Bad Times\", the first song on their first album, uses two bass solos in an influentially dynamic way, as a bridge (when the band drops out after the choruses) to the next verse (after the first chorus) and the guitar solo-driven coda (after the third chorus). Queen's bassist, John Deacon, occasionally played bass solos, notably in \"Under Pressure\" and \"Liar\". In the 1970s, Aerosmith's bassist, Tom Hamilton, played a bass intro on the song \"Sweet Emotion\" from their album \"Toys in the Attic\". Thrash metal group Metallica's 1983 debut album \"Kill 'Em All\" features a solo by bassist Cliff Burton on \"(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth\", which some consider his greatest work. John McVie of Fleetwood Mac performed a notable bass solo on \"The Chain\" from the record-setting 1977 album \"Rumours\".\n\nManowar's bassist Joey DeMaio uses special piccolo bass for his extremely fast bass solos like \"Sting of the Bumblebee\" and \"William's Tale\". Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt played a bass solo on the song \"No One Knows\" from the 1992 album \"Kerplunk!\" and on the song \"Makeout Party\" from the 2012 album \"¡Dos!\". U2 includes a bass solo most notably on \"Gloria\", in which Adam Clayton utilizes several techniques. Bassist Matt Freeman of Rancid has a very speedy, guitar-like bass solo in the song '\"Maxwell Murder\". Blink-182's \"Voyeur\" has a bass solo on both their studio album \"Dude Ranch\" and their live album \"The Mark, Tom and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!)\", in which they must \"prepare for the bass solo.\"\n\nHeavy metal bass players such as Geezer Butler (Black Sabbath), Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse), Cliff Burton (Metallica), jazz fusion bassist Jaco Pastorius (Weather Report), and Les Claypool (Primus, Blind Illusion) used chime-like harmonics and rapid plucking techniques in their bass solos. Geddy Lee of Rush performed a number of solos, most notably in \"YYZ\". Also, in both published Van Halen concert videos, Michael Anthony performs unique maneuvers and actions during his solos. Funk bassists, such as Larry Graham, began using slapping and popping techniques for their bass solos, which coupled a percussive thumb-slapping technique of the lower strings with an aggressive finger-snap of the higher strings, often in rhythmic alternation. The slapping and popping technique incorporates a large number of muted (or 'ghost' tones) to normal notes to add to the rhythmic effect. Slapping and popping solos were prominent in 1980s pop and R&B, and they are still used by some 2000s-era funk and Latin bands.\n\nWhen playing bass solos, hard rock and heavy metal bassists sometimes use bass effects such as fuzz bass or wah-wah pedals to produce a more pronounced sound. Notably, Cliff Burton of Metallica used both distortion and wah-wah. Due to the lower range of the bass, bass guitar solos usually have a much lighter accompaniment than solos for other instruments. In some cases, the bass guitar solo is unaccompanied, or accompanied only by the drums.\n\n\n"}

The film also stars Paula Garcés, Neil Patrick Harris, Jon Reep, Rob Corddry, Ed Helms, David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Jack Conley, Roger Bart, Danneel Harris, Eric Winter, Adam Herschman, and Richard Christy.\n\nThe film was released on April 25, 2008 by Warner Bros.; this film was the first New Line Cinema title to be distributed by Warner Bros. since New Line Cinema became a division of Warner Bros. It is also the first \"Harold & Kumar\" film made in association with Mandate Pictures. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on July 29, 2008.\n\nAfter returning home from White Castle, Harold Lee and Kumar Patel decide to travel to Amsterdam, Netherlands so Harold can surprise his neighbor and newfound girlfriend Maria. At the airport, Kumar argues with a TSA agent for searching him “because of the color of his skin” despite the agent being black. The duo encounter Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa Fanning, who is engaged to Colton Graham, a college friend of Harold's whose family has political connections. The plane passengers mistake Kumar's bong for a bomb and the duo are apprehended by sky marshals. Ron Fox, a neurotic and extremely racist Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, believes the duo are agents of a joint Al-Qaeda and North Korean conspiracy and send them to Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. The duo escape and board a Cuban refugee boat to Miami, Florida where they begin their trek to Texas, hoping Colton can clear their names. \n\nThe duo endure several misadventures on their way to Texas, such as staying at the home of an incestuous sibling couple and their inbred son, escaping a Ku Klux Klan rally, and visiting a brothel with Neil Patrick Harris, who helps them evade capture from Fox. When they reach Texas, Colton agrees to exonerate the duo, but upon seeing Kumar reconnect with Vanessa, Colton instead delivers them to Fox. On the flight back to Cuba, Harold and Kumar subdue Fox’s men. When Fox tries confronting them he is knocked out by Dr. John Beecher the Vice Chairman of the NSA after Fox repeatedly treated him poorly. But he accidentally loses his footing, opens a door and falls to his death. Harold and Kumar escape via parachute, and Fox falls to his death while pursuing them. The two land in President George W. Bush's estate, and after smoking cannabis with the duo, Bush pardons them. The duo are escorted to Vanessa and Colton's wedding by the Secret Service and expose Colton's betrayal to Vanessa and the guests. Colton attempts to attack them, but Harold punches him out.

Composed using the twelve-tone technique, the piece has been considered less accessible than much of Copland's earlier music. It is named for Gerard Manley Hopkins's term \"inscape\", invented:\nHopkins's opposite of \"inscape\" was \"instress\" (\"perception as opposed to intrinsic, essential quality\"), and a commentator writes that Copland, \"uses sounds as an 'instress' that communicates a deeper inner essence, an 'inscape.'\" \"The outward appearance is the boundary chords that frame the composition. The inner reality is the first complete statement of Copland's original melodic idea at P-0, which occurs very close to the middle of \"Inscape\".\"\n\nThe composition begins and ends with eleven-note chords (it may end on a ten note chord), \"perhaps a double tease\", and, \"if there is one over-arching feature to Inscape, it is the alternation of massive blocks of sound, sometimes quite harsh in their harmony, with quieter sonorities and more peaceable gestures.\"\n\nCopland said that the twelve-tone technique, \"freshened his harmonic palette,\" and that the composition uses two different tone rows. Discussing \"Connotations\" (1962), he said, \"As a result [of using the twelve-tone technique] I began to hear chords I wouldn't have heard otherwise; here was a new way of moving tones about that had a freshening effect on one's technique and approach.\" However, he stated that \"Inscape\", \"used it [the technique] in a rather more tonal way than...\"Connotations\".\" \"Through the single, closely-knit movement of \"Inscape\" there is no perceptible contradiction between the serial and diatonic elements, rather they dissolve freely into each other to produce music of a stimulating independence of spirit.\"\n\nLeonard Bernstein remarked after the premiere: \"Aaron, it's amazing how, even when you compose in a completely 'foreign' idiom the music still comes out sounding like you.\" \"The writing,\" also, \"bears the unmistakable imprint of Copland's mature personality, in its wide spacing, its spare, lucid textures, often in just two or three parts, and lithe, cumulative rhythms.\"\n"}

In 2012 \"K2\" became the first Polish game to be nominated for a Spiel des Jahres award. It was also nominated for an International Gamers Award.\n\nThe game features a double-sided board with one side representing an easy ascent and the other a more difficult climbing route. There are also two types of weather conditions that you can use for the climb. This means that there are four combinations of weather and board to set the game's difficulty level.\n\nEach player has two climbers and gains points for the highest position that each one reaches as long as they survive. Players must maintain a minimum level of acclimatisation for each climber to ensure that they do not die on the mountain. This, along with movement up or down the mountain, is controlled by the playing of cards from each player's personal deck.\n\n\"K2\" can be played solo or with up to five players. When there are a number of climbers there is some level of interaction between players due to the limited space on the board. Each position has a stated number of climbers that can stop there meaning that it is possible to block the path upwards or downwards of opposing players.\n\nThe game has been praised for the emotional response it gains from players, including \"moments of extreme tension\". Reviews note that the theme of mountaineering is unique and interesting, while the game mechanics simulate climbing, with realistic scenarios. The variable difficulty level has received positive comments but the replayability of the game has been questioned.\n\nRebel.pl have released \"K2: Broad Peak\" as an expansion for \"K2\". This gives players two challenges based on historical climbs of Broad Peak (formerly known as K3) by Polish mountaineers. They also produced a small expansion called \"The Avalanche\". Kałuża's follow-up game, \"The Cave\", debuted in 2013.\n"}

Zwi Werblowsky and published in 1952. In it, Werblowsky argues that the Satan of John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" became a disproportionately appealing character because of attributes he shares with the Greek Titan Prometheus. It has been called \"most illuminating\" for its historical and typological perspective on Milton's Satan as embodying both positive and negative values. The book has also been significant in pointing out the essential ambiguity of Prometheus and his dual Christ-like/Satanic nature as developed in the Christian tradition.\n\nWerblowsky uses the terminology of Carl Jung and his school in examining \"mythological projections of the human \"psyche\"\", though he emphasizes that he is not interested in the concept of the archetype in the strict Jungian sense. Rather, he sees the myth of figures such as Satan and Prometheus as expressing \"the shortcomings … of the world as conceived by the human soul.\" The relation of power and civilization is explored through the interaction of the concepts of Old Testament sin and Greek \"hubris\". In this analysis, Satan \"becomes the sole power-exponent in this sublunar, post-lapsarian but pre-eschatological universe, and thus stands as the prototype of human civilizing effort.\"\n\nWerblowsky sets out to explore \"the heroic at its limits\", and makes explicit the motivating factor of World War II and its horrors in undertaking this study:\n\n\"Lucifer and Prometheus\" was one of 204 volumes in The International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method series published 1910–1965 and including titles from Jung, Sigmund Freud, Jean Piaget, Erich Fromm and others. It was Werblowsky's first published book. This volume was reissued in 1999 by Routledge. It includes an introduction written by Jung.\n\n"}
{"id": "645001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=645001", "title": "Magyar Televízió", "text": "Magyar Televízió\n\nMagyar Televízió (Hungarian Television) or MTV is a nationwide public television broadcasting organization in Hungary. Headquartered in Budapest, it is the oldest television broadcaster in Hungary and today airs five channels: M1 HD, M2 HD, M3, M4 Sport and M5.\n\nMTV is managed and primarily funded by the Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (, abbreviated MTVA). This government organization, formed in 2011, also manages the public service broadcasters Magyar Rádió and Duna Televízió as well as the Hungarian news agency Magyar Távirati Iroda.\n\nOn 1 July 2015, Magyar Televízió as well as the three other public media organizations managed by the MTVA were merged into a single organization called ().<ref name=\"MTVA/Duna Media Service Announcement\"></ref> This organization is the legal successor to Magyar Televízió and is an active member of the European Broadcasting Union.\n\nFirst pioneer transmissions were in Hotel Gellért in 1936.\nTest transmissions commenced in 1954, however these were generally with stills or short clips of motion pictures, merely for experimental purposes. Regular test transmissions could be received from February 23, 1957. Transmissions began officially on 1 May 1957, when the May Day ceremonies were brought to the viewers for the first time. Daily news programmes began on July 2, 1957. The television service began its career as part of Hungarian Radio, which was renamed \"Hungarian Radio and Television\" on August 18, 1957. MTV suggested the establishment of an international organisation for exchanging television material, which was to be named Intervision. The first four members of the organisation were Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary and Poland.\n\nBy 1959, Hungarian Television had over 50,000 subscribers. In 1960, the Corporation decided to establish an archive, where its programmes are stored even today. In less than ten years of operation, MTV had some 2.7 million viewers by 1964. Studies showed that there were about 3-5 viewers per television set. Another study revealed that by 1965, 46% of the inhabitants of rural areas named television as their choice of entertainment, instead of reading (25%) or radio (10%).\n\nTheatrical transmissions were popular at this time: in 1966 23 plays were broadcast from Budapest, 20 from other cities. Also, 25 television movies and five musicals were transmitted this year.\n\n1969 brought the one millionth subscriber, which meant about 4 million viewers. The first colour recording was made this year: it was Béla Bartók's \"The Miraculous Mandarin\". Although the Orion company presented its first colour television set, transmissions continued to be in black-and-white until 1971.\n\n1971 brought the first regular transmission in colour, and the test transmissions of a second channel were begun as well. This decade was probably the most proliferous in the history of the whole company, with thousands of hours of programming made.\n\nAnnual programming time reached 4.300 hours, equalling to 83 hours a week. Teletext services commenced in 1981, called \"Képújság\" (Picture Newspaper), and television manufacturers started including teletext decoders in their sets. Long-running programmes were started in this decade, including \"Ablak\" (Window) and \"Panoráma\" (a foreign affairs programme). Regional programming began in 1984 in Pécs, and cable television began in Székesfehérvár the same year. \"RTV\", a programme guide similar to BBC's \"Radio Times\" was bought by 1.4 million viewers weekly. MTV's gradual decline began in 1985, this was the final year when MTV was self-sufficient.\n\nThe first broadcast of a telenovela on Hungarian television happened in the mid-1980s with the premier of the Brazilian \"Escrava Isaura\" (Hungarian title: \"Rabszolgasors\" - \"Slave Destiny\" in English). The first Hungarian soap opera \"Szomszédok\" (Hungarian for \"Neighbors\") also started its 12-year-run on 7 May 1987 and was broadcast every second Thursday.\n\nBy the late 1980s, experimental digital television recordings were made, but at the time only in studios. From 1988 seniors of 70 years were exempted from payment of the licence fee. Minority programmes in other languages began too: these programmes were recorded generally in regional studios, primarily in Pécs and Szeged. MTV2 was given some independence from its sister channel MTV1, and just like at the BBC, they were given separate controllers.\n\nBy 1989 the service began broadcasting five days per week to prepare the seven days, as previously Monday only. Some exceptions were made from this practice, for example when the first Hungarian cosmonaut, Bertalan Farkas entered space. \"Nap-kelte\" (Daybreak), a daily television magazine programme began in 1989, the first programme to be made by an independent Hungarian television company, namely Nap-TV.\n\nWith the changeover from socialism, MTV was completely re-structured, some posts were abolished while others were created. Some programmes were axed from both channels, and new ones were started. This decade was a very hectic time in the life of the Company, as TV-presidents seemed to come and go, and so did the programmes.\n\nMTV was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union on January 1, 1993. In 1992, a new public service television station was started, and was named Duna TV. This was completely independent from MTV, although some collaboration exists between the two. Commercial channels became available to cable viewers in Budapest the same year.\n\nIn 1997, TV2, a commercial channel was to be launched on the frequency where m2 used to be. However, MTV argued that by doing this, its audience would be given to the new channel as a present, which would mean severe disadvantage to both MTV and RTL Klub, the other debutee commercial channel. The authorities decided to leave the frequency empty, and allocate a new frequency to TV2. m2, however, was still moved to satellite and cable reception only, which, at the time was quite rare. The programming available on MTV-2 was aimed at audiences which were most unlikely to receive the channel, so this meant a severe handicap for the company. Currently the company is recuperating from the decline earlier.\n\nDuring the 1990s the MTV gradually lost its independence and became the voice of the all-time government, often accused of biased on commenting news . It is one of the most popular sources of news, and its background news programmes such as \"Az Este\" (The Evening) are both liked and internationally recognised. Its line-up of programmes feature long-running shows, such as the science news programme \"Delta\", whilst other programmes like \"A Hét\" (The Week), a weekly review programme and \"Ablak\" (Window), an afternoon-long umbrella programme featuring general interest programmes, were both axed in recent years.\n\nMTV is continuously underfinanced, just like many other public service channels around the globe, and is therefore struggling to produce programmes.\n\nWhilst remaining entirely state-owned, the company was re-organised as a Closely Held Corporation. Funding changed significantly in 2002 with the end of the mandatory television license fee levied on all household with a television set. Following this change, funding for MTV instead began to come from government grants and advertising.\n\nThe 2006 protests didn't leave the headquarters unscathed; in fact, it was occupied by the rioters for a short time.\n\nIn 2000, m2 began broadcasting 24 hours a day, with repeats from its sister channel, m1 and from its archive library and from the Hungarian National Digital Archive and Film Institute (Magyar Nemzeti Digitális Archívum és Filmintézet).\n\nIn 2011, most of the assets and employees of MTV were transferred to the newly created Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (, abbreviated MTVA), a government organization controlled by the Media Council of Hungary. Magyar Rádió and Duna Televízió were also made a part of the MTVA, which, together with MTV, unified all three public service broadcasters in Hungary for the first time. Additionally, the Hungarian news agency Magyar Távirati Iroda was merged into the MTVA and has since been responsible for the production of all news content aired on the three broadcasting organizations.\n\nIn 2015, the unification of all the public media organizations managed by the MTVA was strengthened when all four were merged into a single organization called Duna Media Service (). This nonprofit organization is the legal successor to the four formerly separate entities managed by the MTVA.\n\nThe creation of the MTVA and transfer of the public media organizations into it has been frequently criticised by non-governmental organizations as being politically motivated and intended to the lessen the independence of the public service media in Hungary. The government has stated that restructuring was necessary to improve the finances of the public media system and that all of the organizations within the MTVA retain editorial independence.\n\nIn 2012, MTV launched M3D, first 3D television in Hungary.\n\nMagyar Televízió, who has a trademark on the initials MTV registered with the Hungarian copyright office, sued the American MTV Music Television network for trademark infringement when MTV Music Television launched a Hungarian-language channel in 2007. The suit is still ongoing.\n\n\nThe Hungarian Television's central building was located in the heart of Budapest on Szabadság tér (Freedom Square), across the Hungarian National Bank (Magyar Nemzeti Bank), the U.S. Embassy, and near to the Parliament. The building gave room to the Stock Exchange before the war. It is sold now and MTV has moved to the outskirts of Budapest to a purpose-built modern building. The old headquarters can be reached by a five minutes walk from Kossuth tér where Metro line 2 stops.\n\n\n\n"}

When the game starts, the players powerfully shove backwards, pressing their backs towards other players' backs as they chant \"Oshikura Manju osarete nakuna\", meaning \"Oshikura Manju don't cry when shoved\". The chant is the most famous part of the song, and many people are familiar with only this part. However, the proper song continues; \"Nakuko wa dare yowamushi kemushi hasannde sutero\" (Who is crying? Pinch the coward and caterpillar, and throw them away). The players continue shoving each other, repeating this song over and over. There is no accurate end to this game.\n\nOne variation to the game is to play in a circle drawn on the ground.

{"id": "2326994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326994", "title": "Philco", "text": "Philco\n\nPhilco (founded as Helios Electric Company, renamed Philadelphia Storage Battery Company) was a pioneer in battery, radio, and television production. In North America, it is the Philco brand owned by Philips. In other markets, it is the Philco International brand owned by Electrolux. \n\nIn the early 1920s, Philco made storage batteries, \"socket power\" battery eliminator units, and battery chargers. With the invention of the rectifier tube, which made it practical to power radios by electrical outlets, in 1928, Philco decided to get into the booming radio business. They followed other radio makers such as RCA, Atwater-Kent, Zenith Electronics, Freshman Masterpiece, FADA Radio, and AH Grebe into the battery-powered radio business. By 1930, they were selling more radios than any other maker, a position they held for more than 20 years.\n\nPhilco built many iconic radios and television sets, including the classic cathedral-shaped wooden radio of the 1930s (aka the \"Baby Grand\"), and the Predicta series of television receiver sets of the 1950s.\n\nPhilo Farnsworth, credited for inventing the first fully functional all electronic vacuum tube television system (patent # US1773980- filed Jan 7, 1927), worked at Philco from 1931 to 1933.\n\nPhilco was founded in 1892 as Helios Electric Company. From its inception until 1904, the company manufactured carbon-arc lamps. As this line of business slowly foundered over the last decade of the 19th century, the firm experienced increasingly difficult times. As the Philadelphia Storage Battery Company, in 1906 it began making batteries for electric vehicles. They later supplied home charging batteries to the infant radio industry. The Philco brand name appeared in 1919. From 1920 to 1927, all radios were powered by storage batteries which were fairly expensive and often messy in the home.\n\nA very successful August 1925 product, called the \"Socket Power Battery Eliminator\", was a rectifier unit which enabled users to operate their battery-powered radios from standard light or wall sockets. By 1927 over a million of these units had been sold, but the invention of the vacuum tube rectifier (incorporated into the coming 1928 line of radio sets) made this technology obsolete.\n\nIn 1926, Philco decided to begin making radios. The first Philco radios were introduced in mid-1928, and 96,000 were produced that year, making Philco radios 26th in the nation in production volume. Up to that time most radios were handmade and priced for relatively wealthy consumers. Atwater-Kent, the leading radio seller, coincidentally was also located in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia Storage Battery Company decided that prices of radios could be scaled for a mass market by incorporating assembly line techniques then only used by the automobile industry. By the 1929 model year, Philco was in third place behind Atwater-Kent and Majestic (Grigsby-Grunow Corp) in radio sales. In 1930 the company sold 600,000 radios, grossed $34 million, and was the leading radio maker in the country. By 1934 they had captured 30% of the domestic radio market.\nPhilco radios were notable for their economy of design without sacrificing quality or durability. Like other makers of the era, they offered a wide line of radios beginning with five-tube sets all the way up to high-fidelity consoles with 20 tubes in 1937-38. Philco also made battery-powered radios which were by then called \"farm radios\", most of which had cabinets identical to their AC powered versions. The Philco \"Baby Grand\" (today called \"cathedral\" radios by collectors) was a shape that featured an arched top that wrapped from the sides over the top. This was for economic reason partly, as one piece of wood formed both the top and sides. Philco sold far more of this style than any other maker, a total of over two million (in over twenty models, with from four to eleven tubes) from 1930 to 1938; many of them exist today in collections. By today's standards, most are still excellent performing AM band radios when restored.\n\nA few of their innovations were very futuristic. From 1939 to 1941, they sold radios that were remotely operated by wireless controls, the one-tube \"Mystery Control\", used on their 13-tube model 116RX-SU (or 39-116). This feature was not offered by any other maker until the 1970s stereo receivers. Philco ranked 57th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.\n\nAnother interesting product was the Philco \"Beam of Light\" 78 RPM record players offered in 1941 and 1942. These units had a tiny mirror attached to the player's needle. A beam of light was focused on the mirror which caused a vibrating light to hit a solar cell and produce the audio signal. While this system had some advantages over the standard crystal phono cartridge of the time, it was unreliable and is today a very difficult unit to restore.\n\nPhilco began marketing car radios in 1930 and later expanded into other areas including air conditioners (1938), refrigerators (1939), home freezers (1946), consumer televisions (1947), electric ranges (1949), home laundry washers and dryers (1954), and home entertainment products. Their first consumer television set, the 1948 table Model 48-1000, had a screen and sold for US$395.\n\nBy 1954, Philco had led the radio industry in volume sales for 24 straight years, selling over 30 million radios.\n\nPhilco was also a pioneer in television broadcasting, launching experimental station W3XE in 1932. In 1941 the station became the third commercially licensed TV operation in the United States as WPTZ. It was sold to Westinghouse Broadcasting in 1953 and operates today as KYW-TV.\n\nThe Philco Predicta TV set was introduced in 1957 for the 1958 model year. It was a black and white television with the picture tube mounted in a unique steerable pod on a pedestal. There were many versions: 17\" or 21\" picture tubes, wood or metal cabinets and table or floor standing versions, some with rare UHF tuners. Its specially designed, high-deflection-angle (to achieve a shallow front-to-back depth) picture tube turned out to be a very unreliable design, and cost the company dearly in repairs and reputation. Many of them were sold to motels and bars due to the convenience of the swivel tube arrangement. It was discontinued in 1960; a great failure for Philco. Today, due to the unique design, the Predicta is a collector's favorite and restored examples can easily be found.\n\nIn late 1953, engineers at Philco Corporation invented the surface barrier transistor, the first high frequency transistor suitable for use in high speed computers.\n\nIn June 1955, the National Security Agency and the United States Navy entered into a contract with Philco to build a specialized scientific transistorized computer based on Philco's surface barrier transistor technology. The project was called SOLO, since the idea was to have powerful personal workstations, and the computer was later commercially named the Philco Transac S-1000 . The SOLO transistorized large scale scientific computer was finally built and delivered to the National Security Agency in November 1957. Philco also entered into a contract with the U.S. Navy's David Taylor Basin Research Division in 1955, to build a larger scale fully transistorized computer using its surface-barrier transistor technology, which was named the CPXQ model and later became the Philco Transac S-2000.\n\nPhilco had developed and produced a miniature transistorized computer brain for the Navy's jet fighter planes in 1955, which was called the \"Transac\" (C-1000, C-1100) and which stood for \"Transistor Automatic Computer\". It used Philco's high-frequency surface-barriers transistors in its circuitry design.\nChrysler and Philco announced that they had developed and produced the world's first all-transistor car radio and it was announced in the April 28, 1955, edition of the \"Wall Street Journal\". Chrysler made the all-transistor car radio, Mopar model 914HR, available in Fall 1955 for its new line of 1956 Chrysler and Imperial cars, as a $150 option. Philco's radio manufacturing plant in Sandusky, Ohio, had produced the all-transistor car radio unit for the Chrysler Corporation, which also used Philco's surface-barrier transistors in its circuitry design.\nIn 1955, Philco developed and produced the world's first all-transistor phonograph models TPA-1 and TPA-2. This was originally announced in the June 28, 1955, edition of the \"Wall Street Journal\". Philco had begun selling these all-transistor phonographs in the fall of 1955 for $59.95. The October 1955 issue of \"Radio & Television News\" magazine (page 41) printed a full-page, detailed article, on Philco's new consumer product all-transistor phonograph. The Philco all-transistor portable phonograph TPA-1 and TPA-2 models played only 45rpm records and used four 1.5v \"D\" batteries for its power supply. \"TPA\" stands for \"Transistor Phonograph Amplifier\". Its circuitry used three Philco germanium PNP alloy-fused junction audio frequency transistors. After the 1956 season ended, Philco decided to discontinue the all-transistor portable 45rpm phonograph models, for transistors were too expensive compared to vacuum tubes.\n\nThe Philco Transac models S-1000 scientific computer and S-2000 electronic data processing computer, were the first commercially produced large-scale all transistor computers, which were introduced in 1957. It used discrete surface barrier transistors instead of vacuum tubes (as the integrated circuit had not yet been invented). It also used a fast adder, originally invented by Bruce Gilchrist, James H. Pomerene and Y.K. Wong of the Institute for Advanced Study. It incorporated a speed up technique for asynchronous adders reducing the time for additive carry-overs to propagate.\n\nIn 1959, Philco developed and produced the world's first battery-powered portable transistorized TV. This TV model was called the \"Safari\" and it contained 21 transistors inside. Philco had developed the VHF micro-alloy diffused-base (MADT) transistors and used them in the Safari portable TV. The retail selling price was $250.00 plus the cost of the rechargeable battery, which was $5.25 extra.\nIn 1962, the Philco 2000 Model 212 computer was chosen for use in the North American Aerospace Defense Command's famous Cheyenne Mountain Complex. Three of the machines were installed that year and ran until 1980. The machines were also used by research labs at Westinghouse Electric and General Electric.\n\nIn 1960, NASA contracted with Philco to build the worldwide tracking station network for Project Mercury, and all subsequent man-in-space projects until the ground station network was replaced by the TDRS communication satellites in the 1990s. Philco's Western Development Labs ultimately became Space Systems/Loral, which continues to manufacture spacecraft. In later years, the company produced automotive electronic controls, aerospace tracking systems, and artificial satellites.\n\nIn 1963, Philco was also responsible for the design, manufacturing, installation, and service of all the consoles used in both MOCRs (Mission Operations Control Rooms, a.k.a. \"Mission Control\") at Building 30 of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. Philco technical representatives worked with NASA staff to design and integrate the consoles with NASA hardware and systems. The consoles were used for the Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and Space Shuttle missions until 1998. The Philco-designed and installed consoles in MOCR 2 at JSC have been preserved and will be restored to their Apollo-era configuration for historical purposes. The control room is now listed in the National Register of Historic Places as the \"Apollo Mission Control Center\".\n\nIn 1971, Philco-Ford began to sell reverse osmosis-based water purification systems that used tube-shaped membranes developed by the company to filter and desalinate raw polluted water for municipal utilities and manufacturing.\n\nPhilco Corporation by 1960 had applied for bankruptcy protection. On December 11, 1961, Ford Motor Company purchased Philco and continued to offer consumer products, computer systems and defense related projects. The company continued to provide Ford with car and truck radio receivers and consumer product investments were made to color television production. Along with color and black and white television Philco continued to produce refrigerators, washers, dryers, air conditioners, stoves, radios, portable transistor radios, portable phonographs, audio console systems with high quality \"Mastercraft\" furniture cabinets, and component stereo systems. The company branded Philco products as \"Philco-Ford\" in 1966, and console stereo systems reached their zenith during 1966 and 1967, with high quality cabinet construction and powerful stereo chassis systems of 100- and 300-watt consoles. Philco at one time was one of the largest furniture producers in the world and the end was near for building \"high quality\" furniture cabinets along with stereo equipment. High quality cabinets were replaced with cheaper wood composites covered in vinyl paper with plastic wood pieces, and the quality electronic systems were replaced with cheaper versions imported from Philco in Taiwan. Eventually, all consumer electronic goods would be made by Philco-Taiwan, to lower costs of production and be more competitive in the market. This trend was prevailing in the American electronics industry but Philco-Ford was one of the first to implement. In 1973, a complete line of refrigerators was introduced, consisting of eight side-by-side \"Cold Guard\" models, which used about one-third less electricity than comparable competitive makes. Ford sold Philco to GTE, which also owned Sylvania Electric Products/Sylvania, in 1974. In 1977, Philco International was sold to White Consolidated Industries (WCI). (In 1986, WCI was bought by AB Electrolux.)\n\nThe company (as well as the Sylvania brand name) was acquired from GTE by Philips in 1981 in order to gain the rights to use the Philips trademark in the United States (Philco had been able to keep Philips from using its trademark legally because of the similar-sounding names); as a consequence, Philips sold its products under the name \"Norelco\" in the United States. Philips continues to use the Philco name for promotional consumer electronics and has licensed the name for private brands and retro style consumer electronics. Philips also licensed the Philco brand name to Funai for digital converter boxes for analog TVs in the USA.\n\nIn Brazil, Philco (then Philco-Hitachi) was acquired in 1989 by Itautec, becoming Itautec-Philco and in August 2005 Itautec sold Philco to Gradiente. In August 2007, Gradiente sold the brand to a group of investors, who intended to license the brand to Brazilian appliance maker Britânia.\n\nIn 2003, the Merloni Group acquired rights to the Philco brand (from Philco International) for use in Italy. The Italian Philco produces household appliances in affiliation with ex-Bendix Corporation and Thorn EMI Moyor Electronics (e.g. Bendix 71258 1000 automatic washing machine 1986). As of 2006, the company is mainly recognised in Australia.\n\nIn Argentina, in March 2004, Philco was acquired by a group of Argentine investors. The presence of Philco in Argentina dates since 1930 and remains a traditional mark of appliances in this country. It currently manufactures refrigerators by Helametal Catamarca S.A. (Philco Argentina). All the line electronics, LCD TV, Car Stereos, Air Conditioning, MWO, Audio & DVD, is represented by Newsan SA SANYO and DatandHome SA, with the line of washing machines, dishwashers, air conditioning, water heaters, also the same group.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8680220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8680220", "title": "Rain: A Tribute to the Beatles", "text": "Rain: A Tribute to the Beatles\n\nRain: A Tribute to the Beatles, styled RAIN, is a Beatles tribute and later a theatrical production. \"Rain\" gives audiences the experience of seeing Beatles' songs performed live that were never done so by the band itself. The longest-running Beatles tribute act, it predates the popular Broadway show \"Beatlemania\" by several years. \"Rain\" has played Broadway, and toured for years.\n\nThe show takes the form of a roughly chronological history of The Beatles via their music. About 30 songs are performed during the show. Other than some onstage banter, there is very little dialogue during the production, which consists mostly of exact re-enactments of the Beatles' music. The multimedia production uses high-definition backdrops that feature psychedelic effects, vintage television commercials, and video footage of \"Rain\" cast members recreating iconic Beatle moments. For legal reasons, \"Rain\" never calls its performers the names of the actual members of The Beatles.\n\nEach production of \"Rain\" features two performers for each member of the Beatles, who alternate shows; plus an off-stage keyboardist to replicate the studio sounds familiar from later Beatles records.\n\nRain began in 1975 as Reign, a Laguna Beach, California, band that played both original music and Beatles covers. Founding members were Mark Lewis, Eddie Lineberry, Bill Connearney, Grant Belotti, Chuck Coffey, and Steve Wight. (Connearney, Belotti, Lineberry, and Alan Hawley had been members of a prior band known as Lucky Dogs.) The name of the band, \"Reign/Rain,\" is a reference to the 1966 Beatles single \"Rain,\" the B-side of \"Paperback Writer.\"\n\nCo-founder and keyboardist Mark Lewis managed the band, became its lead arranger, and found Rain a regular weekly gig doing Beatles covers at the Mine Shaft in Calabasas, California, Before long Rain had a following of Beatles fans around the Los Angeles/Orange County area, and soon extended up the West Coast as far as Seattle.\n\nAs the band developed a reputation, they performed at the 1978 The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon. In 1979, producer Dick Clark hired Rain members to record exact Beatles covers for the Richard Marquand film \"Birth of the Beatles\".\n\nBy 1980, Lewis had built the band into a long-standing touring tradition. The lineup of Rain remained constant until 1980, with Lineberry playing John Lennon, Coffey playing Paul McCartney, Connearney playing George Harrison, and Belotti playing Ringo Starr (with Lewis playing keyboards behind the scenes). Joey Curatolo joined Rain in 1978, sharing the role of Paul with Coffey; Curatolo is still a current member of Rain.\n\nLineberry left Rain in 1980, and Coffey, Connearney, and Belotti all left in 1982. Joe Bithorn joined the group as \"George\" in 1983, and is still with Rain. Ralph Castell joined Rain in 1986 as Ringo, and is still with the show.\n\nIn 2001 the Rain Corporation took over management of the band. In 2005, management met with producer Jeff Parry to expand the tribute band's scope — which at that point was mostly doing concerts at casinos — and develop a Broadway-style production in the manner of 1977's \"Beatlemania\". The result of this planning eventually became the 2010 Broadway run.\n\nIn 2008, Pollstar listed \"Rain\" at number 17 in its yearly \"Pollstar's Hot Top 20\" for overall tickets sales of a touring show, band, or production.\n\n\"Rain\" played Hollywood's Pantages Theatre in 2009. In 2010 the production performed at Kansas City's Starlight Theatre and New Orleans' Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts.\n\nIn 2009, on the eve of Rain moving to Broadway, the Rain Corporation and Parry's Annerin Productions agreed to produce a West End theatre version of the show, with both sides splitting the profits 50-50.\n\n\"Rain\" ran on Broadway for 300 shows (and 8 preview performances), first at the Neil Simon Theatre on October 26, 2010 – January 15, 2011, then at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on February 8, 2011 – July 31, 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Parry/Annerin Productions put on \"Let It Be\", a Beatles \"concert experience\" that played in London's West End. In 2013, on the eve of \"Let It Be\" coming to Broadway, the Rain Corporation filed a copyright suit against Parry and his fellow \"Let It Be\" producers. \"Rain\" claimed that \"Let It Be\" was essentially the same concept as \"Rain\", with similar artwork, costumes, and virtually the same song repertoire, and that \"Rain\" was entitled to 50% of \"Let It Be\"'s profits.\" Parry and Annerin instead proposed giving Rain Corporation 7.5% of their profits. The case was settled out of court.\n\nThe show begins with the four actors portraying an early version of The Beatles' appearance at the Cavern Club in 1962. When this scene closes, The Beatles journey to America, beginning their tour at \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". Moving forward, The Beatles' directions are changing musically while their band grows in popularity performing their largest concert at New York City's Shea Stadium. Subsequent scenes use hallucinogenic and psychedelic designs to represent The Beatles' ever increasing experimentation with substances and Eastern philosophies. The show culminates with the breakup of the group and the end of the 1960s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Usually they have to beat other robots in order to become the best one. Many competitions are for schools but several professional competitions are arising.\n\nRobotic competitions have been organized since the 1970s and 1980s. In 1979 a Micromouse competition was organized by the IEEE as shown in the \"Spectrum\" magazine.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to pinpoint the first robotic competition in history two events are well known nowadays for their longevity: the All Japan Sumo from Japan, and the Trinity College International Fire fighting Robot Contest.\n\nOther competitions have grown in popularity with the pass of time, being the Robocup and the Robo One two of the main singular events in current times. In parallel companies like Lego and VEX have developed their own branded events and called them leagues, although they function more like individual cups in regional qualifiers with finals.\n\nThere is some controversy whether university specific challenges should be considered competitions or more workshops, in general the trend is to open competitions to the public in order to prevent nepotism and improve the quality of the robots competing at the event.\n\nSome organizations have been trying to standardize robotics competition through the introduction of full-fledged leagues with a standard calendar, but the model as been only working in specific countries like Spain where the National League was founded in 2008 and is still functioning.\n\nThere are many criteria that can be used to classify robot competitions which makes it hard to establish a standard way of referring to them:\n\n\nAll these competitions are indoors, itinerant in their location and showcase different categories. The competitions in this listing have a yearly recurrent major impact in their locations with a huge national impact or an international significant reach. Map in reference \n\nThese competitions had an important impact on the evolution of technology, public awareness or other robotic competitions in the world.\n\nLocation for these competitions is fixed, usually linked to a venue or institution.\n\nThis events do not have a Wikipedia page but are sourced on the Internet and seem to be ongoing as of today.\n\nIstanbul Technical University Robot Olympics (abbreviated as ITURO) is a robotics competition that has been hosted by Istanbul Technical University since 2007. The organization is open to undergraduates, graduates and high school students. ITURO is a 3-day organization arranged every spring. Almost 1000 competitors and more than 10000 visitors are hosted every year.\n\nThe Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center sponsors an annual international remotely operated vehicle (ROV) competition in partnership with the Marine Technology Society's ROV Committee. First held in 2002, the competition is open to middle school (grades 5-8), high school (grades 9-12), community and technical college, and four-year university students as well as home-schooled students of comparable grade levels. The competition’s class structure of beginner, beginner/intermediate, intermediate, and advanced provides students with the opportunity to build upon their skills, and the application of those skills, as they engineer increasingly more complex ROVs for increasingly more complex mission tasks.\n\nThe International METU Robotics Days event is hosted annually by the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey. The Robotics Days include eight categories of competition as well as lectures, seminars and workshops.\n\nCompetition oriented to challenge teams to produce something visually beautiful with robotics – that is, to have a robot use physical brushes and paint to create an artwork. The competition is open to anyone regardless of age or affiliation and any type of robot can be used. Teams can enter up to 6 paintings in each of the competition categories of “original artwork” and “reinterpreted artwork” where a reference image or existing artwork is used as a reference.\n\nThis events do not seem to be continued anymore or have no reference that we can use to consider them active.\n\nThe competition is organized by the Robot Association of Finland.\n\nThe goal is to build a robot which is able to move without human help off-road. The competition is held annually at the mid-summer Jämi Fly In air show in Finland. \nThe competition track is randomly selected 10 minutes before competition by the judge, marked with four wooden sticks to make a 200-meter track. The track consists of sand roads and fields containing bushes and rocks. The robots must run outside the sticks from start to finish without human assistance as fast as possible. YouTube movies and pictures from the 2007 and 2008 competitions are available.\n\nStudent teams from around the world compete in an outdoor racing competition, where small-scale robots race against other robots to the finish line, without any human guidance or control. Their skills are put to test in a static judging event, a drag race and a circuit race event, where the vehicles navigate around obstacles and obey the traffic rules. These robots are finding their way in applications such as space exploration, mining, search and rescue, remote sensing and automotive inspection.\n\nRobot Racing is an effort to promote research in autonomous mobile robotics technology. The competition provides students with engineering design challenges, including components of mechanical, computer, control software, and system integration. Students work together to design and build robotic vehicles that can navigate twisting, obstacle-filled courses without any human guidance or control.\n\nThe Mobile Autonomous Systems Laboratory, or Maslab, is a university-level vision-based autonomous robotics competition. The competition is open to students of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and requires multithreaded applications of image processing, robotic movements, and target ball deposition. The robots are run with Ubuntu Linux and run on an independent OrcBoard platform that facilitates sensor-hardware additions and recognition.\n\nThe Flying Donkey Challenge is an escalating series of sub-challenges held annually in Africa with a focus on lifting cargo. The initial challenge is scheduled to take place in Kenya in November 2014 with four enabling technology and design sub-challenges and three non-technical challenges.\n\nA series of micro air vehicle (MAV) events have been sponsored by organizations including the University of Florida, the U.S. Army, French DGA, Indian Ministry of Defense, and others. For example, the International Micro Air Vehicle conferences (IMAVs) always includes competitions in which capabilities are demonstrated and missions are performed. The goal of most competitions is to stimulate research on full autonomy of the micro air vehicles. Prizes range up to an aggregate value of $600,000 in 2008.\n\nUBBOTS is an annual robot exhibition taking place at Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The teams have to create a robot that helps humans and simplify their life.\n\nHosted by Duke University, the Duke Annual Robo-Climb Competition (DARC) challenges students to create wall-climbing robots. The competition is discontinued.\n\nSakarya University Robotics Competition (SAURO) is a robotics competition hosted by Sakarya University since 2009. The organization is open to undergraduates, graduates and high school students. The competition is discontinued.\n\nThe first Robot Olympics took place in Glasgow Scotland on September 27–28, 1990. The event was run by The Turing Institute at the Sports Centre at the University of Strathclyde. It featured 68 robots competing in a range of sporting events from. The robots were from 12 different countries and involved over 2,500 visitors over the two-day period. The competition is discontinued.\n\n"}
{"id": "31239724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31239724", "title": "Shadow Hunters", "text": "Shadow Hunters\n\nPlayers are secretly assigned the role of a character belonging to one of three factions: Shadows, which are supernatural creatures of the night, Hunters, which are humans attempting to exterminate the Shadows, and Neutrals, which are unaffiliated characters who are caught in the crossfire with individual victory conditions.\n\nEach player does not know the identity or allegiance of any other player, and must use cards, negotiation, and guesswork to figure out who everyone else is. The game ends when one or more players have fulfilled their victory conditions. At this point all players who have fulfilled their objectives are declared winners, whether they are part of the same faction or even alive.\n\nFirst, shuffle the six area cards and place them randomly on the designated spots on the game board. Next, shuffle the White, Black, and Hermit decks separately and place them face down on the marked area on the side of the board. Now each player must choose a color and place one piece in the \"No Damage\" circle on the board (the HP piece) and one piece in front of them for now (the Player piece). Shuffle the Shadow, Hunter, and Neutral character decks face down separately, and looking at the table below, pick out the appropriate number of cards from each deck, shuffle all of the selected character cards together, then hand out one card to each player, face down. Make sure that other players cannot see your character card when you receive it. Once you have your character card, read over it to see your affiliation, your special ability, and your victory condition. Finally, randomly determine the starting player and begin the game.\n\nTurn order proceeds in a clockwise fashion. On a player's turn, he or she must move their character by rolling the dice and moving their player piece to the area card corresponding to the number they rolled. If a seven is rolled, the player may choose where they want to move, given that it is not the same area that they are currently on. Next, the player may choose whether or not to use the ability stated on the area card. Finally, a player may decide if they want to attack another player within range.\n\nAreas are the locations where player characters will land on and interact with. Listed below are the six area cards and what action players may choose to perform when they land on them.\n\nSingle-Use Cards: Cards that are placed in their deck's discard pile immediately after play. When a deck runs out of cards, its respective discard pile is shuffled and made into the new deck.\n\nEquipment Cards: Cards that the player keeps in front of them when played. They are always in effect when in front of a player. There is no limit to how many equipment cards a player may have.\n\nThe Hermit deck contains only Single-Use cards. Hermit Cards are used to help determine what character and allegiance another player is. When a player draws a Hermit card, they should read what is printed on the card carefully, then hand it face down to the player that they would like to learn more about. The other player will then silently read the card, and if their character matches what is stated on the card, they must suffer the card's effects. If not, the other player must simply say \"nothing happens.\" The player receiving the card may not lie about their character unless they are the \"Unknown\" character.\n\nBoth the White and Black decks contain Single-Use cards and Equipment cards. White Cards are usually beneficial for either the player drawing them or for others. The White deck contain equipment cards that benefit the user through defensive and supportive means. Black Cards are usually used to inflict damage on other players, but will sometimes inflict damage randomly or even harm the user. The Black deck contains equipment cards that benefit the user through offensive means.\n\nAt the end of a player's turn, they have the option of attacking another player within range. The default range is the area card that the player is currently on and the adjacent area card that is paired with it. Some Black equipment cards have the ability to modify a player's attack range. When a player makes an attack, they roll both dice and inflict the amount of damage equal to the difference between the numbers (higher number - lower number) rolled to the enemy player. Attacks made against multiple opponents, which is permitted by a specific Black card, are made by rolling the dice and inflicting that amount of damage to all targets.\n\nAs a player takes damage during the game, they move the HP piece onto the number on the board corresponding to how much damage they currently have. HP pieces are used to show the damage levels of all players. A player's character dies when they have accumulated damage equal or more to the HP listed on their character card. When a character dies, the player must flip their character card face up if they have not already and remove their HP piece and Player piece from the board. If a player has killed another player, they are allowed to take one Equipment card from the dead player and discard the rest.\n\nEach character possess a special ability that they may use when they reveal their character by flipping their character card face up. The exceptions to this rule are \"Daniel\" and \"Unknown\", whose powers are always active. Listed below are all the characters, their affiliations, and their special abilities.\n\nA player wins if they fulfill the victory condition stated on their character card at any time during the game. Once a player's victory condition is reached, they may immediately flip their character card face up if they have not already and declare victory, ending the game. All players who have fulfilled their characters' victory conditions by the end of the game are considered to be winners, making it possible for multiple players, even if they are on opposing teams, to win. If a player's character is dead but their victory condition is fulfilled by the end of the game, they are still considered to be a winner.\n\n"}

{"id": "45137566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45137566", "title": "Vogel's Tonnetz", "text": "Vogel's Tonnetz\n\nVogel's Tonnetz is a graphical and mathematical representation of the scale range of just intonation, introduced by German music theorist Martin Vogel 1976 in his book \"Die Lehre von den Tonbeziehungen\" (english: On the Relations of Tone, 1993). \nThe graphical representation is based on Euler's Tonnetz, adding a third dimension for just sevenths to the two dimensions for just fifths and just thirds. \nIt serves to illustrate and analyze chords and their relations.\nThe four-dimensional mathematical representation including octaves allows the Evaluation of the congruency of harmonics of chords depending on the tonal material. \nIt can thus also serve to determine the optimal tonal material for a certain chord.\n\nThe graphical representation of Vogel's Tonnetz is limited to the three dimensions for fifths, thirds, and seventh. In this representation tones separated by one or several octaves are depicted on the same nodes. The illustration shows the chord which is the most frequent 4-note chord in western music: the major seventh. In Euler's Tonnetz the B-flat is constructed from fifths and thirds. In Vogel's Tonnetz it is given as a just harmonic seventh.\nThe representation of this chord in Vogel's three-dimensional Tonnetz makes its statistical dominance much more plausible than its representation in Euler's two-dimensional Tonnetz: There is a distinct reference note (C), and all other notes are linked to this reference note via simple one-step intervals in this Tonnetz.\n\nThe mathematical representation of Vogel's Tonnetz is four-dimensional, considering also octaves.\nEach tone is represented by a quadruple of numbers specifying how many octaves, \"fifths\", \"thirds\", and \"seventh\" are needed to reach that tone in the Tonnetz (where the terms \"fifths\", \"thirds\", and \"seventh\" denote the prime numbers 3, 5, and 7, instead of the intervals 3/2, 5/4 und 7/4).\nThe C-major seventh chord with the notes c', e', g', and b-flat' could (with reference to C)be represented by the numbers 4, 5, 6, and 7.\nThis corresponds to the quadruple (2,0,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (1,1,0,0), and (0,0,0,1).\nThe quadruple notations represents the prime decomposition of the numbers that are needed to describe the chord, limited to the first four prime numbers.\n\nVogel adopts the harmonic dualism of Arthur von Oettingen, with major and minor chords being mirror images of each other. This view is complemented by a quantitative computation of consonance (or rather dissonance) values.\n\nFor this purpose Vogel introduces virtual reference tones that are not necessarily part of the chord. These reference tones are chosen such that all chord tones have integer relations to these reference tones. For each chord there exists a lower and an upper reference tone, with all chord tones being integer multiples of the frequency of the lower reference tone and integer fractions of the frequency of the upper reference tone. In quadruple notation there are only positive (or zero) values if the chord is related to the lower reference tone, and only negative (or zero) values if the chord is related to the higher reference tone.\n\nTo get a single numerical value describing the complexity of a chord, Vogel builds a weighted sum of the quadruples describing the notes of the chord. He suggests the weights 1, 3, 5, and 7 for the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7. Vogel rejects the more obvious variant where prime number 2 is weighted with 2 because it leads to results that in his opinion do not comply with the perception of musically skilled listeners. Finally, the weighted sum is divided by the number of tones of the chord. This computation is done for both the higher and the lower reference tone. Depending on which of those two values is smaller, the chord is then labeled as \"Oberklang\" or \"Unterklang\" (\"upper chord\", if reference to the lower reference note, or \"lower chord\", if referenced to the upper reference note).\n\nThe C major chord c’-e’-g’ could, for instance, be referenced to C.\nAll three notes of the triad can be represented as integer multiples of the frequency of this reference tone (4, 5, and 6). \nThe prime decomposition yields 2·2,5,2·3. \nApplying the weights suggested by Vogel one obtains a so-called consonance value of (1+1+5+1+3)/3 = 11/3 = 3.67. \nThe same chord may also be referenced to b’’’’: this upper reference tone has 15 times the frequency of c’, 12 times the frequency of e’ and ten times the frequency of g’. \nThe prime decomposition yields3·5,2·2·3,2·5.\nThe consonance value computes to (3+5+1+1+3+1+5)/3 = 19/3 = 6,33. \nAs the consonance value for the lower reference tone is better (smaller), the c major chord c’-e’-g’ is defined to be an upper chord referenced to C.\nThe consonance value of the c minor chord c’-es’-g’ is identical.\nIt is, however, reference to the upper reference tone of this chord, g’’’.\nIn consequence, Vogel rejects the naming of this chord as C minor as its reference note is not C but G. He calls it \"G lower chord\".\n\nVogel suggests a specific notation for upper and lower chords.\nThe notation starts by denoting the reference tone in lower case.\nUpper chords are marked by an \"O\" (Oberklang) and are denoted from left to right, lower chords are marked by a \"U\" (Unterklang) and are denoted from right to left.\nThe C major chord is denoted as cO, the C minor chord is denoted as Ug.\nAdditional symbols for additional notes (7 for adding an upper or lower seventh) are added to the left or to the right, depending on whether it is an upper or a lower chord. \nThe C chord depicted above would be denoted as cO7.\n\nIn addition to the calculation of consonance values for single chords, \nVogel suggests a computation of the consonance of chord transitions.\nWhen transiting from an n-note chord to an m-note chord all N·M note-to-note transitions are evaluated via prime decomposition and weighted sum, and a mean value for all these transitions is computed.\nVogel also suggest to compute a consonance value for an entire piece of music, taking into account a central reference point similar to a final.\n\nThe consonance value calculated with Vogel's formula should rather be termed dissonance value, because with increasing dissonance of a chord or interval its value increases.\nVogel did not claim to predict consonance judgments of today's listeners.\nA close relation of Vogel's consonance values with consonance judgments is in deed not to be expected.\nFirstly, consonance judgments correlate strongly with familiarity judgments.\nSecondly, major and minor are attributed emotional values by today's Western listeners (minor being perceived as expressing sadness).\nThirdly, his formula considers only the congruency of harmonics, but not the congruency of combination tones.\nIt would be more cautious to say that Vogel's formula correlates with the congruency of harmonics, expressing in how far the harmonics of a chord fit together or not.\n\nThe range of the validity of the formula is in addition limited by the limits of hearing.\nA just octave cannot be discriminated from an octave that is mistuned by a schisma (a mistuning of about 2 cent). The perceptual limit for the frequency difference of complex tones is about 0.25 % (4 cent).\nVogel's consonance formula yields a consonance value of (1·1+0·3+0·5+0·7)/2 = 0.5 for the just octave (1,0,0,0), and a values of (14·1+8·3+1·5+0·7)/2 = 43/2 = 21.5 for the octave mistuned by a schisma (-14,8,1,0).\n\nVogel's consonance formula can help to decide, which tones of the Tonnetz should be taken for a certain chord. The consonance value of the seventh chord in Euler's Tonnetz (see figure above) is 8.5. In Vogel's Tonnetz one could select the same tones, resulting in the same consonance value. If one, however, decides to select the just seventh, the consonance value improves to 4.5. Hence, according to Vogel, the seventh chord using a just seventh is to be preferred over a seventh chord where the seventh is built from fifth and thirds.\n\nVogel claims that his formula entails also compositional consequences.\nIf one wants a chord to be consonant, major chords should be composed such that thirds and sevenths are set in a high register.\nMinor chords, however, would have to be set the other way round, with thirds and sevenths being set in a low register.\nThis is by no means compatible with the compositional practice of the last centuries (with perhaps the exception of the Tristan chord, see below).\nIn consequence, minor chords set along Vogel's composition rules sound unfamiliar.\nThey exhibit, however, a better congruency of harmonics than their classical variants.\nThe left-hand of the two C minor chords in the adjoining figure is composed in the classical way, with the third being set in a high register. The consonance value for this chord is 4.33.\nThe right-hand minor chord features a low third. It sounds unfamiliar. Its consonance value is, however, much lower (3.0), and the congruency of its harmonics is much better.\n\nVogel considers the theoretically infinite four-dimensional space of tones of his Tonnetz as complete; no further dimensions are needed for higher prime numbers.\nAccording to his theory, consonance results from the congruency of harmonics. The prime number 11 and any other higher prime number can not lead to any perception of congruency, as the inner ear separates only the first eight to ten partials. The eleventh partial may be audible and discriminable from the tenth or twelfth partial if isolated via techniques such as flageolet. If presented as part of a complex tone comprising also the adjoining partials these partials would fuse together, and a congruency with the partial of another note could no longer be detected. It might be interesting to test whether it is possible to detect harmonic congruency for higher prime numbers for instruments with odd partials, as the distances between partials are higher in these instruments. With training it might be possible to detect consonance up to prime number 17 or even 19.\n\nThe Tristan chord is a historically important chord in Richard Wagner's opera \"Tristan and Isolde\". Its role in functional harmony cannot clearly be determined. It is considered to be tonally unsettled and extremely chromatic.\n\nIn Vogel's Tonnetz this chord appears to be the dual counterpiece of a major seventh chord. This interpretation is strengthened by the observation that this G-sharp minor chord with an added lower seventh (E-sharp or F is a seventh below the reference of this G-sharp minor chord, the D-sharp) resolves in a E major chord with an added upper seventh (see also the adjoining animated figure). In addition, Wagner's way to set this chord is compatible with this view, with the third (B) and the seventh (F or E-sharp) set in a low register. In Vogel's notation one would note this chord as 7Ud, as the reference note of the G-sharp minor chord is the D-sharp.\n\nIt is not very likely that Vogel's notation for minor chords will win recognition. It would require that a C minor chord is denoted as Ug, as lower chord under g. A compromise notation could be to denote the Tristan chord as Gm/F, i.e., as a G-sharp minor chord with an F in the bass.\n\nThe \"explanation\" of the Tristan chord in Vogel's Tonnetz as a well-composed counter-piece of a major seventh chord cannot be compared to an \"explanation\" in the scope of functional harmony. Both types of explanations cannot really explain why certain chords and chord sequences have established themselves in musical history. Functional harmony focuses on the relation of a chord to the prevailing tonality. In consequence, it cannot explain chord progressions found in late-romantic music where there is no longer a continuous tonality present. In contrast, Vogel's theory focuses more on the congruency of the notes of a single chord, or with the notes of the preceding or subsequent chord than on the role of this chord in the context of a prevailing tonality. Vogel's analysis reveals that the Tristan chord is by no means an attack on the tonal system as such but that it is part of it exactly as its counterpart, the major seventh chord.\n\nA similar chord is also often used by jazz musicians.\nThere it is commonly notated as a half-diminished seventh chord.\nThe Tristan chord could hence be noted as Fm).\nThis way to describe this chord misses its relation to a G-sharp minor chord.\nIt results from the practice to describe chords starting from their lowest note.\nAccording to Vogel this is appropriate for upper chords, but not for lower chords.\nLower chords should be described top-down instead of bottom-up.\nThe principle of starting with the lowest note is not consequently observed in other situations, such as with inverted chords.\nA C major chord in its first inversion is not typically described as an E minor chord with altered fifth (Em).\n\nVogel's Tonnetz resorts on a theory (Euler's Tonnetz) that is more than 100 years older than the presently dominating functional harmony.\nVogel's Tonnetz and functional harmony are not in conflict with each other.\nOn the contrary, they can be seen as complementing each other:\nWhile Vogel's theory focuses on local relations of tones and chords, \nfunctional harmony considers the global role of a chord in the context of the entire piece of music.\nHowever, the prevalence of functional harmony and the peculiarities of Vogel's notation hamper the general reception.\nVogel's consonance formula has only recently been tested empirically. \nKaernbach suggests a simplified notation:\nwriting always from left to right, using capital letters for the reference tones (avoiding confusions with the convention to use lowercase letters for minor chords), and using a triangular symbol (▲ und ▼) to denote upper and lower chords. \nThe beginning of the prelude of Tristan and Isolde could then be denoted as \nD▼7 → E▲7.\n\n"}

{"id": "36613262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36613262", "title": "X-Men: Days of Future Past", "text": "X-Men: Days of Future Past\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past is a 2014 superhero film based on the fictional X-Men characters that appear in Marvel Comics. A British-American venture, \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" was directed by Bryan Singer; it is also the seventh installment of the \"X-Men\" film series, the sequel to both \"\" (2006) and \"\" (2011) and is the fourth and, currently, final film of the original X-Men series and the second film in the X-Men prequel quadrilogy. The story, inspired by the 1981 \"Uncanny X-Men\" storyline \"Days of Future Past\" by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, focuses on two time periods, with Wolverine traveling back in time to 1973 to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants. The film features an ensemble cast, including Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart. Simon Kinberg wrote the screenplay from a story he conceived with Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn.\n\nVaughn had directed \"\" and was set to return in \"Days of Future Past\" before leaving for \"\". Thus Singer, who had directed the first two \"X-Men\" films, made his return as a director, and brought along most of the crew from those productions. With a budget of $205 million, principal photography began in Montreal, Quebec in April 2013 and concluded in August the same year, with additional filming and pick-ups taking place in November 2013 and February 2014. Twelve companies handled the visual effects.\n\n\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" premiered in New York City on May 10, 2014, and was theatrically released on May 23. It is the second-best reviewed film in the \"X-Men\" film series following \"Logan\", drawing favorable notices for its story, visual effects, action scenes, acting, thematic elements and Singer's direction. During its theatrical run, the film earned over $747 million worldwide, making it the sixth highest-grossing film of 2014, as well as the second highest-grossing film in the series behind \"Deadpool\". The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects, making it the first \"X-Men\" film to be nominated for an Oscar.\n\nIn a year 2023 at a dystopian future, Sentinels have been programmed to identify and hunt down mutants and any humans who dared to help them. A small band of mutants were attacked and Kitty Pryde sends Bishop's consciousness back in time a few days before the attack, in an effort to warn the other mutants so as to ensure their survival.\n\nProfessor Charles Xavier and other mutant survivors later meet Kitty Pryde at a remote Chinese temple, and explains the history of the Sentinels, which were designed by Bolivar Trask, whom Mystique assassinated in 1973. Feared by Trask's death, the government forces immediately captured Mystique and experimented on by scientists who used her DNA to advance their Sentinel program explaining how they are able to adapt to nearly every mutant power. Because of Kitty's time traveling ability, Xavier and Magneto plans to prevent Trask's assassination but since Xavier cannot survive going back decades, Wolverine volunteers instead since his regenerative powers would allow him to survive the process.\n\nAfter awakening in his younger body in 1973, Wolverine arrives at the X-Mansion, discovering the school has been shut down for years due to many of the students and staffs being drafted to the Vietnam War. A young, broken Xavier turned into alcoholism and has shunned his mutant powers by using a specialized serum that suppresses his telepathic abilities in order to walk. Hoping to reunite with Mystique, Xavier agrees to help Wolverine and busts Erik Lensherr , who got incarcerated in 1963 after John F. Kennedy got assassinated due to him, (he maintains his innocence later on) out of his prison cell under the Pentagon, aided by Hank McCoy and Peter Maximoff.\n\nMystique discovers Trask has been experimenting on mutants and in revenge plots to assassinate him at the Paris Peace Accords. Her vengeance results in failure after Xavier, Hank, and Wolverine intervene, and Erik attempts to kill her to prevent the Sentinel takeover from happening. A fight ensures between Hank and Erik which allows Mystique to escape but the three expose themselves as mutants to the world. Trask takes advantage of this event and successfully convinces President Richard Nixon to initialize the Sentinel program.\n\nErik obtains his signature helmet back from the Pentagon to block out Xavier's psychic powers and secretly takes control of Trask's Sentinel prototypes. Returning to the X-Mansion, Xavier ultimately abandons the serum, regaining his mutant power, and communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the relationship between mutants and mankind. After using Cerebro to track Mystique, he, Hank and Wolverine take flight to Washington, D.C. to put an end to her assassination plot on Trask.\n\nAt a ceremony where Nixon unveils the Sentinels, Xavier, Hank, and Wolverine search for the disguised Mystique. Erik appears, controlling the Sentinels, and uses the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium to surround the White House. Hank transforms into Beast and fights a Sentinel. Wolverine confronts Erik, but is thrown into the Potomac River. Nixon, Trask, and Mystique hide in a safe room beneath the White House, but Erik rips it out of the building with the intention of killing the U.S. President.\n\nIn the future, the Sentinels managed to find the X-Men and launch an attack on them; one by one perished while attempting to buy more time. Meanwhile back in 1973, Xavier persuades Mystique to spare Trask after she saves President Nixon from Erik, altering history and erasing the Sentinels from existence. Erik and Mystique both leave, one a criminal, the other a hero; and Trask is jailed for attempting to sell U.S. military secrets to Vietnamese officials.\n\nWolverine wakes up at the mansion in 2023 to find Iceman, Rogue, Colossus, Kitty, Beast, Storm, Jean Grey, Scott Summers and Xavier all alive. Wolverine speaks to Xavier, who is also aware of the changes in history. Back in 1973, the younger Wolverine is rescued by Mystique, who is disguised as William Stryker.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, set in Ancient Egypt, an Egyptian crowd is seen chanting to En Sabah Nur, who telekinetically elevates building blocks to forge pyramids as four horsemen observe him from afar.\n\n\nAdditionally, Famke Janssen and James Marsden reprise their roles as Jean Grey and Scott Summers / Cyclops respectively in cameo appearances. Lucas Till reprises his role as Alex Summers / Havok. Evan Jonigkeit portrays Mortimer Toynbee / Toad. Gregg Lowe portrays Eric Gitter / Ink. X-Men comic-book writers Len Wein and Chris Claremont appear as United States congressmen. Michael Lerner plays Senator Brickman. Mark Camacho portrays U.S. President Richard Nixon. Singer cameos as a man with a small film camera as Magneto walks away after Mystique's escape in Paris. In a post-credits scene, Brendan Pedder portrays the ancient mutant, En Sabah Nur.\n\nProducer Lauren Shuler Donner stated in August 2006 that a continuation of the \"X-Men\" main film series would require a renegotiation. New cast members of \"\" were signed, while the older cast members were not. Donner said, \"There is forty years worth of stories. I've always wanted to do 'Days of Future Past' and there are just really a lot of stories yet to be told\". She later pitched the idea of a fourth installment of the \"X-Men\" franchise to director Bryan Singer, following the completion of the 2011 prequel \"\". In March 2011, Donner said the film was in \"active development at Fox\"; she said, \"We took the treatment to Fox and they love it ... And \"X4\" leads into \"X5\"\".\n\n20th Century Fox saw \"X-Men: First Class\" as the first film of a new \"X-Men\" trilogy. Donner compared the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the \"Harry Potter\" film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, \"\"First Class\" is similar to \"Batman Begins\", where you have the fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just get on with it and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight\"\". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, \"I thought it would be fun to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto\". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about \"changing history\" in an interview with \"Empire\" magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past \"erasing\" the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.\n\nKinberg said the main focus of this film was the future of the \"X-Men\" film series. With the use of cast members from the original trilogy and from \"First Class\", they needed to decide the sequels' destination. In preparation for the film, Kinberg studied films about time travel, including \"Back to the Future\", \"The Terminator\", and \"\". Singer originated a philosophy and a set of rules for the time travel in the film so the story would be as plausible as possible.\n\nAccording to Kinberg, as they were writing the script, they thought it is sensible that Wolverine was traveling between time periods, because of his ageless look and ability to heal rapidly. He further stated of making Wolverine the time traveler, \"We made the decision for a lot of reasons  ...  he's the protagonist of the franchise, and probably the most beloved character to a mass audience\". Kinberg and Vaughn considered Bishop and Cable candidates for the role of time traveler. Kinberg said Rachel Summers was in the first draft of the script; she sent Wolverine back to 1973. The character was later replaced with Kitty Pryde, to whom Kinberg gave a secondary power of sending people's consciousnesses into the past. Juggernaut, Jubilee, Nightcrawler and Psylocke were also considered for the film.\n\nSinger was asked how the film integrates the themes of the earlier \"X-Men\" films; he said, \"It establishes that some villain characters may have been right with their fears. It confronts the notions of hope and second chances. Its characters that are lost trying to find themselves. In \"X-Men 1\" and \"2\", the characters had come into their own and knew who they were. In this one, they're all lost and they're trying to keep it together\".\n\nIn November 2011, Simon Kinbergco-writer of \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" and co-producer of \"X-Men: First Class\"was hired to write the film's screenplay. In May 2012, 20th Century Fox announced the film would be released on July 18, 2014. The release was later moved forward to May 23, 2014. In August 2012, the title for the film was confirmed to be \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\". The film is inspired by Chris Claremont and John Byrne's X-Men comic book storyline, \"Days of Future Past\", which introduced the idea of an alternate future for mutants that grew from the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants' killing of a senator, leading to a future in which mutants are hunted by Sentinels.\n\nIn October 2012, Vaughn left the role of director to focus on Mark Millar's \"\" (2014). Singer was later announced as the film's director; it was his third directorial role in the \"X-Men\" film series. In preparation for the film, Singer approached James Cameron to discuss time travel, string theory and multiverses. In the same month, Richard Stammers was approached to be the visual effects supervisor, as Singer liked his work in the 2012 film \"Prometheus\".\n\nSinger brought back most of the crew he had in \"X-Men\" and \"X2\". In December 2012, two long-absent designers were hired: production designer John Myhre, who had only done \"X-Men\", and costume designer Louise Mingenbach who also did \"X2\" and \"\". In February 2013, John Ottmanwho aside from \"X-Men\", collaborated on all of Singer's works since the 1995 film \"The Usual Suspects\"was confirmed to work on the music and the editing of the film.\n\nSinger used the online social networking service Twitter to announce casting of the film. In November 2012, he announced that James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult would reprise their roles from \"X-Men: First Class\". Later the same month, he announced that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen would reprise their respective roles as the older versions of the characters played by McAvoy and Fassbender. In December, Singer announced that Hugh Jackman would reprise his role as Wolverine.\n\nIn January 2013, Singer announced that Anna Paquin, Shawn Ashmore, and Ellen Page would reprise their roles of Rogue, Iceman, and Kitty Pryde. In February, Singer announced that Peter Dinklage would star in the film as the main antagonist. In March, Singer announced that French actor Omar Sy had joined the cast. Halle Berry said in an interview that she would reprise her role as Storm, which was followed by an announcement from Singer that Berry would be in the film. Singer tweeted a picture of the cast, which confirmed that Daniel Cudmore would return as Colossus and that Fan Bingbing and Booboo Stewart had joined the cast.\n\nIn April, Singer announced that American singer and songwriter Lady Gaga had joined the cast as Dazzler, but it was later revealed as an April Fools' Day prank. Singer retweeted a photograph of himself, Adan Canto, and confirmed cast members Patrick Stewart, McKellen, and Ashmore, which was followed by a confirmation from Canto that he had joined the cast. In May, Singer announced that Evan Peters had been cast as Quicksilver. In June, Australian actor Josh Helman was cast in a role. In July, Singer tweeted a picture of actor Lucas Till on the set of the film, which confirmed that he was returning as Havok. In January 2014, Evan Jonigkeit had been cast as the younger version of Toad.\n\n\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" had a production budget of $205 million. Principal photography began on April 15, 2013, at Mel's Cité du Cinema in Montreal, Canada, and ended on August 17, 2013. Filming had to begin in April 2013 to accommodate the cast's individual schedules. Olympic Stadium, Montreal City Hall, and McGill University were also used as filming locations. An aerial plate unit was sent to film in Washington, D.C. Additional filming took place in Montreal in November 2013 and February 2014. According to the \"Calgary Herald\", the film is the second most expensive produced by 20th Century Fox after \"Avatar\" (2009). Comic book writer Chris Claremont said in an interview that he was consulted for the film.\n\n\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" is the first \"X-Men\" film to be filmed in native 3D; it was shot using Arri Alexa-M cameras with Leica Prime lenses and Fujinon Zoom lenses, along with 3ality Technica TS-35 camera rigs and Stereo Image Processor (SIP) technology systems. Director of photography Newton Thomas Sigel was asked about using Arri Alexa-M cameras; he said, \"For Bryan and myself, the Alexa has been almost the gateway to getting the look we like in film\". Sigel added that the Arri Alexa-M camera's small size was a big advantage to the film's main unit, which carried three 3D rigs. The film also used the Alexa XTs for the production's 2D work.\n\nProduction designer John Myhre said his work load was \"six months squeeze[d] down in to 3-4 months\", given the sets were massive but he did not have the usual time to design and build before principal photography began. The lue underground hallways and Cerebro sets were faithful recreations of the sets seen in the first \"X-Men\", albeit ransacked and damaged to imply the government had raided the mansion. The sets had many hidden \"Xs\", including the staircase of the X-Mansion. Myrhe said he wanted to embrace the 1970s setting in the same way \"First Class\" embraced its 1960s setting, and costume designer Louise Mingenbach also drew heavily from 1970s styles for the clothing seen in the 1973 scenes. Hoult wore corduroys, Jackman a wooden-paneled buckle and a peacock-print shirt, and McAvoy wore a brown leather jacket. Peters wore 1981-inspired clothing; this was Mingenbach's way of showing Quicksilver's irreverence for the exact time and place. In one scene, Mingenbach gave Fassbender as the younger Erik Lehnsherr a fedora as a nod to the one the character wore in the first X-Men film. For the future period of the film, Mingenbach wanted a darker, slightly futuristic and tactical look for the characters. This included changing the suit Patrick Stewart had previously worn as Xavier to battle fatigues.\n\nThe Sentinels had two separate versions, to depict how the earlier prototypes built by Trask in the 1970s evolved into the adaptable killing machines of the dystopian future. Singer described the 1973 version as \"a little fun and stylish but also a little retro\", with a key element being that they are made of plastic to be unaffected by Magneto's powers. Myhre used styles from molded plastics from the 1970s to design Sentinels from that period, and cited inspiration from both the cars of the decade and \"those wonderful TV sets that were round with smoked glass panels\". The overall style was bulky to fit \"the traditional idea of a robot looks like\", and drew the most from the comics version, such as the purple color and a humanoid shape, while trying to stand out on its own with its retro design. The robots' ability to fly was compared to a Harrier Jump Jet, as the Sentinels had vertical takeoff and could glide. Life-sized Sentinels were built by Legacy Effects to be featured on the set, and had articulated joints to be fully poseable. The sound effects averted metallic noises, while adding woof effects on the Sentinels' footsteps to display its weight on the ground.\n\nOn the other hand, the future Sentinels would resemble \"giant versions of Mystique\" to show how their technological development was based on studying the shapeshifting mutant's DNA. Thus their design is sleek and feminine, with a body covered in mechanical scales that move during the process of adapting to a mutant's attack, while also featuring angular and dark faces to enhance the intimidation. The future robots would feature what Singer described as \"biomechanical technology to transform to adapt to other mutants, to take on their physicality and some of their powers to use against mutantkind\", which the director imagined to be fueled by nanotechnology and \"the ability to really change things almost at a molecular level\". The Sentinels' heads would also open up as an extra weapon, and for straighter combat the robots could create blades and spikes out of their limbs. The crackling sound of the robots' scales was made by rubbing riveted belts on shale rocks.\n\nFor the future setting of the film, a set featuring a hillside monastery was built. Myhre was inspired by Chinese temples built on the sides of cliffs. The future set also featured a mixture of architectural styles from China, India, and Indonesia. Part of the set was a big wall, which was inspired by the Great Wall of China.\n\n\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" had 1,311 visual effects shots produced by twelve studios. Richard Stammer served as the overall effects supervisor based on his work for \"Prometheus\". The leading company was Moving Picture Company, who created the future Sentinels and worked on the sequences involving the X-Jet and Cerebro's red virtual world. The Sentinels' scaled bodies were created by adapting a tool originally developed to create hair and fur, which would later evolve into creating a proxy representation of each individual scale as a \"follicle\". Another major contributor was Digital Domain, with effects from the 1973 portion that encompassed nearly a third of the work. These included the Sentinels, Mystique's transformations and eyes, and various digital environments. Digital augmentation turned a remote airstrip into a Vietnam prisoner camp and added Paris' famed mansard rooftops to the Montreal locations. The environment work based on Washington, D.C. required the team to study period references of the National Mall and White House, and photograph almost all of RFK Stadium to create a detailed digital replica.\nRising Sun Pictures created a sequence considered by many reviewers the centerpiece of the film's effects, where Quicksilver uses his super speed in the Pentagon kitchen. Depicting how, to a speedster, actions in real time come down to a virtual standstill, objects float around in slow motion. After doing LIDAR scan of the kitchen set, the digital recreation added many computer generated props - cooking gear, cutlery, vegetables and water released by a fire sprinkler system - rendered in near microscopic detail regarding placement and lighting, particularly because the footage had to work in 3D. To simulate Quicksilver running on the walls, Evan Peters and a stunt double were filmed in both the set being suspended by a harness and on a treadmill that stood in front of a chroma key green screen. Only Peters' legs were digitally replaced. Despite the sequence only having 29 effects shots, it required nearly seven months of work from RSP's team of 70 artists.\n\nRhythm and Hues Studios worked on Beast's transformations, the creation of Xavier's plane, and speed effects for Quicksilver. They also worked with Digital Domain on the sequence featuring the inside of the 1973 Sentinel. Mokko Studio worked on Mystique's eyes and costume fixes. Cinesite worked on the future New York City in the opening prologue along with clean-ups, wire removals, and production fixes. Fuel VFX worked on holographic effects and Havok's mutant powers. Vision Globale worked on visual effects relating to a dream and flashback sequence. Hydraulx, Lola and Method Studios handled a number of compositions and production fixes. The Third Floor worked on extensive story-boarding and visualisation.\n\nDirector Bryan Singer's regular collaborator John Ottman worked on the score of the film, in addition to being its editor. Ottman is the first composer to score more than one film in the \"X-Men\" film series, having previously scored \"X2\" (2003). This also marked the first time a theme from a previous X-Men film has been retained; Ottman re-used some of his themes from \"X2\", most notably the main title theme. While Ottman retained the same style of \"lyrical and build upon character themes that would weave in and out of the film and done in a straight orchestral sense\" that he had used in \"X2\", following Singer's request he tried to compose \"something more 'modern'\" that could be compared to other contemporary superhero scores, and not follow Henry Jackman' score for \"First Class\". The 1970s setting inspired the inclusion of \"synthesized elements with some analog synths and electric piano and bass and some guitar\". The film score was released on digital download on May 16, 2014, on CD on May 26, 2014, and on vinyl on August 4, 2014. An expanded version of the soundtrack, including music exclusive to \"The Rouge Cut\", was released on June 24, 2015 by Sony Classical Records.\n\nThe world premiere of \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" occurred at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City on May 10, 2014. It was released in international markets in 2D and 3D theaters on May 21, 2014, and in the United States on May 23, 2014.

The set tour video was included with the home video release of the 2013 film \"The Wolverine\".

Kinberg and Dinklage attended WonderCon to discuss the film. Singer withdrew from the publicity rounds for the film because of a lawsuit alleging sexual abuse filed against him. In July 2014, 20th Century Fox and Oculus Rift presented a \"virtual reality experience\" in 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International. Attendees were given a chance to sit in a replica of Professor X's wheelchair and virtually hunt Mystique in the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nIn July 2013, a mid-credits scene teasing \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" was attached to the theatrical release of \"The Wolverine\". The scene, set two years after the events of \"The Wolverine\", depicts Wolverine going through an airport security checkpoint while a commercial for Trask Industries plays in the background. Suddenly, Wolverine notices that all the metal objects around him start to shake and levitate. He turns around to see Magneto, who says he needs Wolverine's help to combat a threat to all mutants. When Wolverine asks Magneto why he should trust him, the people around them freeze as Xavier approaches Wolverine and assures him that Magneto is telling the truth. Adam Pockross of Yahoo! Movies described the mid-credits scene as the coolest part of \"The Wolverine\" and wrote, \"Boom! And that's how you tease the next film: by giving us so much to chew on, yet so few answers\".\n\nThe first official trailer for \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" was released in October 2013. Jason Callina of \"Herald News\" gave the trailer a positive response, saying, \"it is fantastic to see characters that I grew up with in the flesh  ...  we still have to wait till the end of May to see if Fox succeeded, but for now they have my interest\". Ben Child of \"The Guardian\" criticized the trailer for the number of characters that will appear in the film. Child wrote, \"overloading the movie with superheroes might please fans of the comic books, but the rest of us will be chewing on our own spleens when the umpteenth brightly coloured dude turns up to spout one line of dialogue, then drop off the map\".\n\nA mid-credits scene teasing \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" was attached to the theatrical release of \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" in April 2014. In the scene, which is set during the Vietnam War, Mystique tries to infiltrate a military camp led by William Stryker to recruit fellow mutants Havok, Ink, and Toad. \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" director Marc Webb had an existing contract with Fox Searchlight Pictures to direct another film following \"500 Days of Summer\" (2009). After \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", Webb's negotiations with Sony Pictures Entertainment stalled because of his commitment to Fox. Fox eventually agreed to allow Webb to direct the sequel of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", and in exchange, Sony promoted the X-Men film without charge. In addition, three viral websites were launched before the release of the filmTrask-Industries.com in July 2013, TheBentBullet.com in November 2013 and 25Moments.com in April 2014. To further promote the film, Jackman made a guest appearance on the April 28, 2014, episode of \"WWE Raw\". The segment received mixed reactions.\n\nIn July 2013, CKE Restaurant Holdings, Inc. and 20th Century Fox announced a promotional partnership for the theatrical release of \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\". The promotion included advertising, in-restaurant merchandising, collectors' cups, and a film-themed burgerThe Western \"X-Tra\" Bacon Thickburger sold it CKE Restaurants outlets Hardee's and Carl's Jr.. Zachary Eller, senior vice president of marketing partnerships & promotions at 20th Century Fox, said, \"their fun and irreverent advertising campaigns are a great fit with our film and we couldn't be more thrilled to join together to feed mutants everywhere!\".\n\nMountain Dew partnered with the film to promote it globally; the promotion included prizes, a television commercial, online exclusives, in-store and in-theater advertisements, and commemorative packaging featuring X-Men characters from future and past. Anna Roca, senior vice president of international promotions at 20th Century Fox, stated, \"The adventurous, energetic attitude of [Mountain Dew's] fan base mirrors the franchise's ownand their international reach helps bring our beloved mutants to more corners of the world than ever before\".\n\nIn March 2014, Virgin Trains launched an 11-car Pendolino train, which featured the film characters on the carriages, at London's station to promote the film. Hugh Jackman and James McAvoy attended the launch.\n\nKia Motors collaborated with 20th Century Fox to promote the home media release of the film with a Wolverine-themed Sorento. The SUV made its debut at the 2015 Australian Open, with a series of videos featuring Rafael Nadal teaming up with the X-Men to save the tennis event from the Sentinels.\n\nIn June 2014, cable network FX acquired the television rights to \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\". The film was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on digital download on September 23, 2014, and on DVD, Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on October 14, 2014. In the United Kingdom, it was released on November 10, 2014. Three versions were released; a Deluxe Edition containing the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and digital download; a Blu-ray and digital download combo pack; and a single-disc DVD.\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released an alternate version of the film, titled \"The Rogue Cut\", on July 14, 2015. It added 17 minutes of previously unused footage, including a subplot involving Anna Paquin's character Rogue, whose role was reduced to a brief cameo in the theatrical release. \"The Rogue Cut\" was also screened at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International.\n\nIn the \"Rogue Cut\", Rogue's role is more consequential, and the narrative is more complex: When Kitty Pryde is accidentally wounded after Wolverine's consciousness experiences a phase between past and future from seeing Stryker in 1973, Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the former X-Mansion, the one place where Xavier's mind cannot reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. Xavier, Magneto, and Iceman succeed in rescuing Rogue, but at the cost of Iceman's life. Rogue uses her power to take over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels are able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand that was severed from the X-Jet during their escape. In another scene, Mystique spends the night at the X-Mansion, revisits her previous romance with Beast, and destroys Cerebro the next morning in order to prevent Xavier from finding her. A new mid-credits scene shows Bolivar Trask imprisoned at the Pentagon cell for selling military secrets to foreign countries.\n\nWorldwide, \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" earned $262.8 million during its opening weekend, the highest worldwide opening weekend for an \"X-Men\" film.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" combines the best elements of the series to produce a satisfyingly fast-paced outing that ranks among the franchise's finest installments\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nSean O'Connell of Cinema Blend gave the film four and a half stars out of five, and said it was \"the greatest, most complete and staggeringly entertaining [\"X-Men\" film] to date\". \"Empire\" gave it four out of five stars and called it, \"The best X-Men film since the second one\". Steve Rose of \"The Guardian\" rated the film three stars out of five; he said, \"Non-devotees might struggle, but director Bryan Singer whips up the action towards a symphonic climax\". David Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said, \"While it's more dramatically diffuse than the reboot and lacks a definitive villain, the new film is shot through with a stirring reverence for the Marvel Comics characters and their universe\". Justin Chang of \"Variety\" said, \"If the characters' quandaries at times feel overly circumscribed, they're also advanced with a bracing emotional directness, devoid of either cynicism or sentimentalism, that touches genuine chords of feeling over the course of the film's fleet 130-minute [sic] running time\". In 2016, James Charisma of \"Playboy\" ranked the film #8 on a list of \"15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals\".\n\nIn contrast, Robbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" rated the film two stars out of five and called the plot \"a curate's egg, thoroughly scrambled\". He concluded, \"The film squanders both of its casts, reeling from one fumbled set-piece to the next. It seems to have been constructed in a stupor, and you watch in a daze of future past\". Simon Abrams, writing for RogerEbert.com, gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it a \"visually driven and paint-by-numbers-plot\". Abrams was critical of the undeveloped subplots that built up because the film's pacing left little time to develop each element of the story set in the 1970s.\n\nFollowing criticism of \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" for killing off major characters such as Professor Charles Xavier, Cyclops, and Jean Grey, \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" has subsequently been viewed by some critics as a revision of those controversial plot elements in \"X-Men: The Last Stand\".\n\n\n"}

The third season of the series is currently in production. \n\nIt tells the story of Yu Zui, a police cadet who enters the society; and the challenges and dangers he face as an undercover cop. \n\nA group of young students at the Police Academy gets into a fight at a local restaurant and are at risk to be expelled from the profession. Xu Pingqiu, a highly respected figure in the industry, offers them a second chance. If they are able to succeed with his training, they are able to become certified police officers and their past crimes will be erased. However, the training is very atypical. The students a dropped in the middle of an unfamiliar city with nothing other than a cellphone and bracelet, and they have to survive forty days. Through various methods, Yu Zui finds and gathers his team mates. In the midst of chaos, one of the students, Shu Biao disappears. Yu Zui finds and mistakenly kills the person who kidnapped Shu Biao. After he was imprisoned, Yu Zui discovers that he was being deceived. There, he becomes good friends with his fellow inmate, Fu Guosheng, whose actual identity is the leader of a Drug Trafficking ringleader. He becomes an undercover cop to get closer to Fu Guosheng, who later sent him to spy on Zheng Chao. Yu Zui wants to make use of the distrust between Fu Guosheng and Zheng Chao to eliminate the latter, while Zheng Chao wants to get rid of Yu Zui.\n\nUnder Yu Zui's instigation, Zheng Chao betrays Fu Guosheng and established his own drug ring; causing him to be estranged from his former boss. Zheng Chao was later caught, and Yu Zui replaces Zheng Chao as the leader of the criminal organization. His rise to position raises Fu Guosheng's suspicion, who sends Si Hai to test him. Yu Zui discovers Fu Guosheng's plan in time, and gradually gains the latter's trust. Lin Jingyu also joins Yu Zui in his undercover mission and together the two of them tries to crack down on Fu Guosheng's crimes. At the end of the season, Fu Guosheng was arrested with the help of an unexpected person and Yu Zui rejoins his team mates at the Police Academy.

It attracted more than 100 million views on iQiyi within days of its premiere, making it one of the most popular TV series tailored for the online platform. It also has a score of 8.9/10 on Douban, becoming one of the highest rated dramas. Television producer and critic Xie Xiaohu credits the success of “Yu Zui” to the unique character of its protagonist, who differs from the usual straight-laced, incorruptible police officers; and the show's attention-grabbing and lewd content. The background of the original writer Chang Shuxin, who was jailed decades ago and thus has a good understanding of police officers, also contributed to the success of the show.\n\nDespite the show's success, the series was later taken off the internet. Numerous sources have pointed to China’s media regulation body, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television (SAPPRFT), who banned the show for its explicit content.\n"}
