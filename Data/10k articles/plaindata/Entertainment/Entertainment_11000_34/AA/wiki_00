{"id": "3875634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3875634", "title": "3D&amp;T", "text": "3D&amp;T\n\n3D&T, formerly known as \"Defensores de Tóquio\", is a Brazilian tabletop role-playing game, created by Marcelo Cassaro. It is designed to be a very simple, beginner-friendly game system.\n\nThe name of the game is a pun on the famous \"Dungeons & Dragons\" or \"D&D\"; the original version of the game – \"Defensores de Tóquio\" (\"Defenders of Tokyo\") – was a satire of tokusatsu, fighting games, and anime series. It was created by Marcelo Cassaro and published by Trama Editorial, later known as Editora Talismã. It spawned \"AD&T\" - as implied by the name, an \"advanced\" edition (and a pun on AD&D). Finally, \"3D&T\" means \"Defenders of Tokyo 3rd edition\". The major change on the 3rd edition was that it was turned into a generic game, dropping its satire roots. It was a huge success, becoming as popular as \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"\" among Brazilian roleplayers.\n\nAn even simpler version, like GURPS Lite called \"3D&T Fastplay\", was made freely available online.\n\nA revision, \"3D&T Manual Revisado, Ampliado e Turbinado\", was released in 2003.\n\nDissatisfied with the poor management at Talismã – also publishers of RPG magazine \"Dragão Brasil\", of which he was editor-in-chief – Marcelo Cassaro left to start a new RPG magazine, \"RPG Master\" for Mythos Editora, a magazine entirely dedicated to 3D&T (although the news releases for other systems) and soon after, \"Dragon Slayer\", fully devoted to the d20 System; meanwhile, Talismã kept publishing 3D&T, despite \"not\" having the rights to do so. Ultimately, \"Dragon Slayer\" was very successful and remains in print, while Talismã closed their doors.\n\nAs a successor to 3D&T, a new system named 4D&T was published in 2006 by Editora JBC (Brazilian publisher of manga). It completely dropped 3D&T's own fast, in this the player uses 4 six-sided dice. The book was published under the Open Game License. This edition is itself a change of the d20 System, but with six-sided dice.\n\nAlthough it has succeeded on its own, it has been poorly received by 3D&T players, given the original purpose of the system was to be as simple as possible.\n\nIn May 2008, Cassaro was told by Guilherme Dei Svaldi, editor-in-chief at Jambô Editora, that he found 3D&T to remain very popular, despite being out of print for years. This surprised Cassaro, and gave him the idea of bringing 3D&T back; it was released again in September 2008, under the name \"3D&T Alpha\" (the new name inspired by \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\", which Cassaro and Erica Awano had adapted into a 4-issue comic book series published by Trama in 1998/99). It is also available as a free e-book from Jambô's website. In this new version, the combat rules remain basically the same; the advantage/disadvantage system was fine-tuned; and, most importantly, the magic system was completely revamped. Also, now the book is printed in landscape format.\n\nIn 2010 the first major setting for 3D&T Alpha was announced: Mega City, by Gustavo Brauner. It was finally published in mid-2012, bringing as setting a megalopolis in which five different smaller settings coexist: \nMega City allows to either choose one of the smaller settings to play, or to combine some of them (or even all of them), teaching how to balance the different kinds of characters.\n\nA second major setting was released in the same year: Brigada Ligeira Estelar \"(Star Light Brigade),\" by Alexandre Lancaster. It's a mecha/space opera/swashbuckling setting, bringing an empire spread in seventeen solar systems that together form the Constellation of Sabre – main target of invaders from outer space called \"The Forsaken,\" while the empire itself is divided by political intrigue. \"Brigada\" brings a heavy influence of classic sci-fi anime like Mobile Suit Gundam, Captain Harlock, Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Star Blazers, having as player characters mecha ace pilots, space pirates, space condottieri, swashbuckling noblemen and others.\n\nA game aimed at beginners, 3D&T focus on simplicity and ease of play.\n\nAs in GURPS, each character is built with a pre-determined number of \"points\" (typically 5) to distribute between the main stats, magic power and advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThere are 5 stats:\n\nThe magical powers of characters are defined by \"Elemental Paths\" (\"Caminhos Elementais\", in the original), which measure how well the mage can control the elements - there are 6 \"Elemental Paths\": Fire (\"Fogo\"), Water (\"Água\"), Earth (\"Terra\"), Air (\"Ar\"), Light (\"Luz\") and Darkness (\"Trevas\").\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages are special powers which characters can possess; advantages cost points, and disadvantages \"give\" more points to spend. Finally, there is also a special kind of advantages, called \"skills\" (\"Perícias\"), which are things that your character can do, but with no relation to combat: \"Animals\",\"Arts\", \"Crime\", \"Investigation\",\"Languages\", \"Machines\",\"Manipulation\", \"Medicine\", \"Science\",\"Sports\" and \"Survival.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "45275996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45275996", "title": "American Sharia", "text": "American Sharia\n\nAmerican Sharia is a 2015 American buddy cop comedy-drama action film directed by Omar Regan, written by Omar Regan, and stars Omar Regan, Baba Ali and Eric Roberts. The film is about rogue government officials using Islamophobia to maintain power while two Muslim police officers attempting to solve a case involving the disappearance of several Muslims.\n\nOfficer Richardson (Eric Roberts) profiles every Muslim he sees as a terrorist. He goes on an arrest frenzy, which makes the community activists, Jihad (Adam Saleh) and Osama (Sheikh Akbar) take to the streets and rally the people to stand up for their rights.\n\nThe Chief of Police (Joshua Salaam) wants to gain the trust of the Muslim community in order to get re-elected, but Attorney Leila Rodriguez (Yasemin Kanar) is standing in the way with a discrimination lawsuit against Officer Richardson and the Motor City Police Department. The Chief calls, Mohammed (Omar Regan) who keeps his faith to himself and his own prejudices against Islam, following constant exposure to Islamophobia, and partners him with a Middle Eastern, Detective Abdul (Baba Ali), who proudly shows his religious values. Together, they have to solve a case involving the disappearance of several Muslims as well as a respectable Muslim leader who is charged with an assault arrest. The Chief wants them to \"Speak Muslim To The Muslims\" which he thinks will guarantee his re-election and results in ending rising Islamophobic tensions between the police and the community.\n\n\nOmar Regan is the director, producer and writer of \"American Sharia\", and it is the first production under his company Halalywood Entertainment. In 2012, Regan wrote the story and it then took about two years to get the film project started. Before production for the film even began, Regan created a two-minute trailer in hope of selling the project to investors. In December 2013, the campaign for the film was launched, Regan used Kickstarter to generate funds for the film and the film earned $122,000 in donations in less than 40 days. The film cost £124,000 to make.\n\nIn February 2015, Regan told \"Asian World News\" \"I had some life experience which really affected me. In 2009, the government killed my father. He was Muslim and they said he wanted to establish Sharia in America. They shot him 20 times! He was the victim of Islamaphobia. He’s gone and there was no way to defend himself. Later, they put a small clip on the news confirming he really wasn’t a terrorist. I didn't want to make a hate film in response to that, but instead to re-educate the public. I want to focus on changing the mindset of people- so they don't automatically look and judge. There are over 1 billion Muslims worldwide, so why is it that everyone is painted with the same brush?\"\n\nBilled as \"the first ever Halal Comedy/Action feature film of its kind,\" \"American Sharia\" is a buddy-cop comedy-drama film starring Detroit-born comedian Omar Regan and Iranian American comedian Baba Ali. The two actors play Muslim cops from completely opposite backgrounds, who band together to fight crime in Detroit and learn a few things about religion, culture and stereotypes along the way. The film aims to be humorous and respect the boundaries of Islam.\n\nIn February 2015, Regan told Asian Image, \"\"American Sharia\" is a Hollywood motion picture that sets out to use comedy to reverse the prejudices held against Islam and help promote the religion in a more positive way. It's an alternative form of entertainment, during a time where we are surrounded and exposited to increasing negativity and profanity.\"\n\nWhen the project became financially secure, Regan decided to bring the production to the diverse communities of Metro Detroit. The film crew is composed of people from diverse backgrounds, religions and ethnicities.\n\nCity officials in Dearborn Heights were lenient regarding the production of the film, allowing the cast and crew to shoot at several prime locations, including at the Berwyn Senior Citizen Center. Scenes were also shot at the Alsadek Market on Warren Aveue in Dearborn and in and around Downtown Detroit. At the end of June 2014, the production of the film completed in Dearborn Heights after a month-long shoot around Metro Detroit that employed dozens of Muslims and Arab Americans from California, New York and Michigan. On the last day of production at the Berwyn Senior Citizen Center, more than 100 extras turned out, many dressed in Islamic attire, to shoot a scene depicting a homeless shelter being raided by the police.\n\nIn February 2015, Regan told \"Asian Image\", \"\"American Sharia\" is a Hollywood motion picture that sets out to use comedy to reverse the prejudices held against Islam and help promote the religion in a more positive way. It's an alternative form of entertainment, during a time where we are surrounded and exposited to increasing negativity and profanity.\" Whilst speaking with \"Asian Sunday Newspaper\" he added, \"...The message of the film is that we all need love and unity because we all are the creation of Allah.\"\n\nBetween February and March 2015, British charity Penny Appeal are due to exclusively host the UK screenings of \"American Sharia\" at specially selected venues in 22 cities. The film is due to be released in Malaysia, Qatar, Dubai, Canada and the United States.\n\nThe exclusive film tour helped the British Muslim community raise £1 million to help vulnerable orphans in Bangladesh, The Gambia, India, Pakistan, Palestine and Sudan.\n\nAneesa Malik of \"Asian World News\" said of the film \"action packed comedy that’s a sure fire way to tickle your funny bone... It explores real-life situations where Muslims are mistakenly seen to be 'radicalised' and uses comedy to defy such assumptions.\" \"The Asian Today\" called the film \"an action comedy that lifts the curtain on real Muslim lives.\" \"Urban Asian\" called it a \"hilarious new film\". \"Desi News\" called it a \"family-friendly film\".\n\nAalia Khan the \"Asian Sunday Newspaper\" rated the film 1/5 and said, \"...the cheesy comedy and stiff acting paved the way for this movie to be a much hyped let down... On the other hand it was a good effort in trying to shed light on some of the misunderstandings surrounding Islam.\" Steve Bennett of \"Chortle\" said, \"This limited circuit is probably where \"American Sharia\" will stay, as it's hard to see the movie to making a mainstream crossover.\"\n\n\n"}

It was released on February 18, 2016, in Japan. On April 7, Koei Tecmo announced a Western release in North America and Europe for August 2016. Microsoft Windows and Xbox One versions were also revealed. On August 21, 2017, Koei Tecmo America confirmed that \"Attack on Titan 2\" has been set for a 2018 release. \n\nThe game retells key moments from the \"Attack on Titan\" manga (1 through 19-), in addition to new scenarios involving the key characters.\n\nIn 845, when Eren was just 10 years old, the \"Colossal Titan\" suddenly appeared. Large enough to breach the Wall, it allowed other Titans to rampage through the city. One of them ate Carla, Eren's mother. With the so-called \"Armored Titan\" now preventing access, Wall Maria was abandoned and humanity were forced to fall back to Wall Rose. Having lost his family, his home and his dreams, Eren swore revenge on the Titans. Aiming to become a member of the Scout Regiment, he joined the \"104th Cadet Corps.\"\n\nFive years after Eren enlisted, the \"Colossal Titan\" suddenly appeared again. Eren tried to fight it alone but failed to defeat it. He returned to headquarters and then takes a squad out himself, but the mission was a failure with Eren suffering a terrible injury to his leg and many soldiers being killed. When Armin was about to be eaten by a Titan, Eren sacrifices his life to save him. Immediately before the Trost District Wall was destroyed by the Colossal Titan, elite members of the Scout Regiment were on a mission outside the Wall. The principle role of the Scout Regiment was to scout beyond the Wall, seeking a way to take back Wall Maria which was lost 5 years previously. Setting up supply bases in destroyed towns and villages, they sought to secure a route for a large force to make their way to the Shiganshina District, where the Wall was destroyed. Fighting with the Titans outside the wall as they go, they sought to secure the route while making new discoveries along the way.\n\nThe brave resistance offered by the Garrison Regiment, combined with the return of the Scout Regiment, was enough to keep Wall Rose safe from the Titans. Within the Walls, however, the same chaos descended as was experienced when Wall Maria was lost 5 years previously. Not only has the Colossal Titan attacked humanity again, but the damaged Wall has been repaired - unbelievably - by the \"power of the Titans.\" Is Eren an ally for humanity or just another enemy? As the debate continues within the Walls, the Scout Regiment - newly joined by Eren - begin their 57th mission to the outside world.\n\nThe game's visuals matches that of the anime series and it features one player fighting multiple enemies. The 3D Maneuvering Gear can be used to ascend to high areas.\n\nThe game features ten playable characters. Initially, only three can be selected. But as players progress through Attack (story) mode, more characters are unlocked.\n\n\nThe game was published by Koei Tecmo and developed by Omega Force, and was first announced at Gamescom. A new trailer was unveiled on November 6, 2015, in addition to details about the Collector's Edition. It was released for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita in Japan. Subsequent versions for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows were announced following its Western announcement by Koei Tecmo. Initially the English voice cast were going to recorded dialogue, however the budget would not allow for this.\n\n\"Attack on Titan\" sold approximately 150,682 copies in its first week in Japan, outselling \"Street Fighter V\" during that week. As of April 28, Koei Tecmo announced it had sold 280,000 copies in total in Japan. As of Koei Tecmo's 2016/17 FY report, the game has sold in 350,000 copies in the West and a cumulative 700,000 copies worldwide. \n\nAttack on Titan received polarizing positive reviews. \"Famitsu\" four reviewers awarded it consecutive scores of 8/9/9/8, which added up to an overall score of 34/40. PlayStation LifeStyle awarded it a score of 8.0 out of 10, saying \"Attack on Titan is an excellent example of a passion project made right.\" However, in other places, it got mixed to negative reviews.\n\nA sequel game to Koei Tecmo's \"Attack on Titan\" (titled \"Attack on Titan 2\") was announced in August 2017 and was released in March 2018.\n"}
{"id": "18400732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18400732", "title": "Authoritarian literature", "text": "Authoritarian literature\n\nAuthoritarian literature is a term used by John Gardner to designate the body of literature written by persons living under an authoritarian governmental regime. Literary works produced in these regimes share common characteristics that make the designation useful. Authoritarian regimes revere their leaders, who historically were typically referred to as kings, along with advisors to the king. These leaders were considered innately better than ordinary people. The authoritarian leader, and his approved circle, if not directly writing about a subject themselves, were the only ones who could designate, approve, and sanction writers as acceptable authorities. Government authorities also financially supported writers under a patronage system. The writers in such a system therefore must necessarily be careful to ensure the composition of their work met (or would meet) the approval of authorities. Failure to comply risked official warnings, loss of governmental sanction, and sometimes even imprisonment or loss of life.\n\nFiction produced under authoritarian regimes tends to be didactic. Subject matter can vary in terms of plot, but the didactic point of the work is almost always to illustrate what authorities would consider the proper comportment of individuals within the authoritarian society. This didactic point is conveyed to readers in order to idealize the existing social structure and thus, hopefully, perpetuate it. Authoritarian fiction is considered to be demonstrative in purpose rather than explorative. The author's narrative voice is also usually authoritarian in order to impart something known by the author that is presumably not known by the reader. Since most people don't enjoy and resist being spoken to as an inferior, the more successful (or popular) authors of such literature are the ones who best disguise, or sugarcoat, their didactic purpose. One common way to achieve such indirectness is through the use of the form allegory.\n\nGood examples of authoritarian literature include \"Beowulf\", \"Pilgrim's Progress\", and in English literature we see vestiges as late as Charles Dickens. While didacticism forms a significant component of Shaw's, Orwell's and C. S. Lewis' fiction as well, their works can not strictly be considered as authoritarian literature because they were not writing at the whim of political leaders. Dickens was not writing for the British government either, but he used the same forms of his predecessors, who did write for the court, particularly in his earlier novels, such as \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"David Copperfield\", where we most easily observe a certain preachiness. Dickens constructed his plots for the sake of demonstration rather than the purpose of exploration. However, Charles Dickens is a transitional figure, and in his later novels, such as \"Great Expectations\", we can \"feel the two impulses warring in the writer's mind\".\n\nAuthoritarian literature is, of course, not a purely historical phenomenon. It persists as the dominant form of everyday literature of Middle Eastern countries (Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, and arguably Palestine and Iran's literature excepted), and, until recently, Chinese literature. To understand the nature of authoritarian literature's purpose is to better understand the reason for the forms in which we see literature currently being produced in these countries.\n\nThe antithesis to Authoritarian literature is Anti-Authoritarian literature. Practitioners of this genre in the aforementioned countries are routinely subjected to harsh sanctions, and many choose to go into exile in order to write freely. Still other writers suffer censorship and imprisonment at their government's hands (e.g. Sunallah Ibrahim and Abdul Rahman Munif). Authoritarian literature authors, however, who write works of fiction that support or praise governments, as expected, often see promotion to positions of authority within their respective country's governing cultural body\n"}
{"id": "25474650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25474650", "title": "Blade II (video game)", "text": "Blade II (video game)\n\nBlade II is a 2002 action/beat 'em up video game developed by Mucky Foot Productions and published by Activision for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Originally scheduled for North American release on the same day as the theatrical release of the \"Blade II\" film (March 22), it was ultimately released on September 3, the same day the film was released on DVD.\n\nThe game is not a direct adaptation of the film, but is actually a sequel, taking place between the events of \"Blade II\" and \"\". Set six months after the events of the film, it follows Blade and Whistler as they attempt to prevent the vampires from creating a race of super-vampires even more powerful than the Reapers. \n\nThe developers championed the game as introducing a new type of never-before-seen melee combat into video gaming. However, most reviewers disliked the system, and the game as a whole was met with mainly negative reviews on both the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox. The game was also a commercial failure, selling less than half a million units across both platforms.\n\n\"Blade II\" is an action/beat 'em up game played from a third-person perspective, with the player controlling Blade's movement via the left analog stick. The game primarily focuses on melee combat, although it does allow the use of firearms. \n\nCombat is controlled via the right analog stick, allowing for what the developers call a \"360° combat system\" – the player moves the stick in the direction in which they want to attack and Blade punches or kicks in that direction. The player has no control over what kind of attack Blade executes, only the direction in which he attacks. Blade can also block, chain attacks together into combos and perform \"finishing moves,\" such as grabbing an enemy in a headlock and driving a stake into their head.\n\nA major feature of the game is Rage mode. Fighting slowly and methodically charges up Blade's Rage meter through three levels: \"Sword\", \"Shield\" and \"Strength\". If the player activates Rage mode on the first level, Blade will take out his sword and use it for a limited amount of time. If activated on the second level, Blade uses his sword and becomes invincible. If activated on the third level, Blade uses his sword, becomes invincible and increases in strength.\n\nAt the start of the game Blade is equipped with only a \"mach pistol,\" but as the player advances they can unlock other weapons and accessories; a shotgun, a glaive, stronger body armor, silver knuckles, UV grenades, and serum to increase Blade's health regeneration.\n\n\"Blade II\" takes place six months after the events of the film, with Blade having vanquished Nomak and the Reapers.\n\nThe game opens with Blade (voiced by Tom Clark) and Whistler (Don Delciappo) receiving information that a blood exchange is taking place between a mafia outfit and a vampire clan in the parking lot of Karkov Towers, a multi-company tower block and possible vampire safe house. Blade arrives just in time to see the exchange, with a suited vampire disappearing into the tower carrying a briefcase. According to Whistler, the briefcase contains a vial of DNA and must be recovered. Blade fights his way into the tower through the underground car park, and then passes through the \"Exploitika\" nightclub before destroying the computer mainframe of a vampire-run company called Nth Phase. Eventually, he finds the vampire with the briefcase, who reveals that the DNA is actually that of Damaskinos, former overlord of the Vampire Nation, and a DNA sequencer is currently unraveling the DNA. Blade is able to destroy the machine and then meets Whistler on the roof. Whistler gives him a canister of poison, which Blade puts into the ventilation system, killing every vampire in the building.\n\nUpon returning to their base, however, Blade and Whistler discover that their ally, Dr. Grant (Kate Magowan) has been kidnapped by the Byron vampire clan. Following her GPS signal leads to a subway station where Blade fights his way through the vampires into the sewers, where he is joined by Whistler, who plants a series of bombs. Blade detonates the explosives, and follows the sewers to Gaunt Moor Asylum, where the Byrons have taken Grant. Blade rescues her and she explains the vampires are torturing humans so as to capture \"dark energy\", an experiment they have called \"Project: Vorpal\". Blade escorts her out of the building and returns to investigate Vorpal. He discovers the vampires are using the dark energy to attempt to create a super vampire warrior much stronger than even a reaper. However, Blade is able to destroy the incubation chamber and Grant then reveals the Arcan clan is really behind the project, not the Byrons.\n\nBlade heads to the Arcan's mountain base. He infiltrates the facility and destroys the dark energy storage chambers. He then meets up with Grant, who he escorts to the dark energy receiver. However, before she is able to take it offline she is caught in an explosion. As she dies, she tells Blade he must destroy the core. He heads there, meeting Whistler, who plants a series of bombs. The duo flee the base and set off the explosions, destroying the core and putting an end to Project: Vorpal.\n\n\"Blade II\" was first announced on January 22, 2001 when Activision revealed they had partnered with UK based developers Mucky Foot Productions to produce the game for several as-yet unnamed next generation consoles. On February 2, in an interview with IGN, the game's director, Mike Diskett, revealed the gameplay would be melee-based, but players would also have access to Blade's sword and firearms. Diskett explained that Mucky Foot had pitched a game to Activision called \"Sky Ships\". Activision passed on publishing the game but were impressed with Mucky Foot's work and offered them the \"Blade\" franchise. Diskett also explained the combat system in \"Blade II\" had originally been created for \"Sky Ships\", and revealed the game would be released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.\n\nThe game was officially unveiled on November 20, when Activision announced it was not going to be a direct adaptation of the film, but a stand-alone story which takes place after the events of the film. The 360° combat system was also demonstrated for the first time. The game was next shown at E3 in May 2002, where the Rage system was revealed. On May 23, IGN published a full preview. Writer Jeremy Dunham liked the idea of the 360° combat system but found it difficult to get used to, and especially difficult to switch from one target to another. He also found the camera system to have faults, often getting caught behind walls and doors. However, he praised the game for capturing the spirit of the film well (something which he felt the first game had failed to do) and admitted he was looking forward to the final build.\n\nOn June 20, IGN published an interview with lead artist Fin McGechie. He went into detail about the origins of the 360° combat system, which was born from the developers' frustrations with games that allow players to lock onto only one target at a time and force them to manually switch when they want to attack something else.\n\nIGN published another preview on July 26. By this stage, the combat system had been finalized, but writer Hilary Goldstein was unconvinced by it. He criticized the fact that the player couldn't control what type of attack Blade did at any given time (punch, kick, elbow etc.). Instead all that the player could do was control the direction in which he attacked. He also criticized the lack of a lock-on during melee combat, and felt the system in general seemed unfinished; \"it sounds simple, but somehow it doesn't translate properly to gameplay as most combat looks more chaotic than it needs to be. With no way to lock onto specific targets in hand-to-hand combat, it can get confusing whom you're attacking. The combat-style, while different, is counter-intuitive to the way gamers are used to enjoying action games. That could mean a whole new style of gameplay for one person, but may be incredibly frustrating for a stubborn old-school gamer like myself.\"\n\nThe game was released in North America on September 3, the same day the film was released on DVD.\n\nThe Xbox version of \"Blade II\" received \"mixed\" reviews, while the PlayStation 2 version received \"generally unfavorable reviews\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n\"Eurogamer\"s Martin Taylor was critical of the combat system, arguing that to achieve combos, the player had to play too slowly: \"The way the system is implemented has turned Blade's martial arts abilities from a brutal dance of death to more of an awkward waltz of confusion.\" He was also highly critical of the fact that the sword is only accessible in Rage mode, he found the graphics average and the voice acting \"worryingly bad.\" He concluded, \"\"Blade II\" is a missed opportunity. What should have been a good chance for some \"Devil May Cry\"-style combat with fantastic characters and recognizable environments has instead turned out to be an extremely dull and awkward jaunt through some dull levels.\"\n\nGameSpy's Kevin Murphy, too, criticized the PS2 version's limited use of the sword: \"This ultimately hurts the game, as it's really fun hacking with the sword.\" He also disliked the combat system; \"Players are just pushing the right analog stick around and don't have any control over the actual moves Blade uses, just the direction of his attack. While this is a wonderful control scheme when enemies surround you, it's just not as good as letting the player decide to punch, kick, or throw.\" He concluded \"\"Blade II\" isn't all bad. It has its moments and fans of the character will be content, but not overjoyed with the title. Hardcore and casual gamers alike, however, will tire of it very quickly.\" Steve Steinberg wrote of the Xbox version's combat system, \"it probably made more sense in theory than it does in actual application,\" calling it \"the stick version of button-mashing.\" He also criticized the AI, saying: \"The game would have been far better with fewer, but more intelligent, enemies. As it is, it's just you against wave after wave of poorly developed enemies.\" He concluded, \"Ultimately, \"Blade II\" plays more like a platformer for adults than like an action title [...] Clean up some of the rough language, give Blade a big, bulbous, cutesy head, and replace the millions of vampires per level with an equal number of collectible trinkets and you'll have something the Nintendo crowd can tackle when they're done with the latest \"Mario\" romp.\"\n\nGameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann said, \"\"Blade II\" has some of the worst enemy AI so far this year.\" He was critical of the graphics, the sound and the controls, concluding, \"If you find yourself out shopping for some \"Blade II\"-related items, take a pass on the game and stick to the movie. Poor AI, dull design, and lackluster presentation all add up to make \"Blade II\" a game that you should definitely skip.\"\n\nIGN's Jeremy Dunham said of the PS2 version, \"there isn't much to find beyond the horrendous controls and suspiciously bad gameplay.\" He was critical of the control system, saying \"Admirable as the attempt at a new attack system may be, we think that a more traditional method of attack would have been a better way to go.\" He was also critical of the graphics, and concluded, \"\"Blade II\" has turned into our most recent poster child for how NOT to make a movie-licensed videogame.\" Hilary Goldstein was equally unimpressed with the Xbox version. He too was critical of the combat system, finding it too limiting: \"The combat system seems to be begging for more. Chains, grabs, fluidity. But those things are absent. Because you have to use the thumbstick, and because the thumbstick represents the direction of an attack and the attack itself, combat seems very stilted.\" He was also critical of the story, missions and AI, referring to the game as \"a momentary distraction in video game life.\"\n\n\"Blade II\" was a commercial failure, selling less than half a million units across both platforms. Its failure was indirectly responsible for the closure of Mucky Foot Productions. When Mucky Foot acquired the \"Blade\" franchise, they had already developed two commercial failures; \"Urban Chaos\" and \"Startopia\", both of which had been published by Eidos. Mucky Foot wanted to make \"Urban Chaos 2\", but Eidos were not especially interested. According to company director Gary Carr, \n\nHowever, because the game had to be ready to ship to coincide with the DVD release of the film in North America, development was rushed, and the game was released before the developers were fully happy with it. After finishing with \"Blade II\", Mucky Foot began work on two more film adaptations; \"Bulletproof Monk\" for Empire Interactive and \"The Punisher\" for THQ. However, THQ were unimpressed with \"Blade II\", and cancelled \"The Punisher\", which left Mucky Foot in the position of being unable to complete \"Bulletproof Monk\" without letting staff go, which they were unwilling to do. They spent several months re-pitching \"Sky Ships\", the game which had developed into \"Blade II\", to various publishers, but were unable to generate any interest, and the company closed in October 2003.\n"}
{"id": "5215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5215", "title": "Casino", "text": "Casino\n\nA casino is a facility which houses and accommodates certain types of gambling activities. The industry that deals in casinos is called the gaming industry. Casinos are most commonly built near or combined with hotels, restaurants, retail shopping, cruise ships or other tourist attractions. There is much debate over whether the social and economic consequences of casino gambling outweigh the initial revenue that may be generated. Some casinos are also known for hosting live entertainment events, such as stand-up comedy, concerts, and sporting events.\n\nThe term \"casino\" is a confusing linguistic false friend for translators.\n\n\"Casino\" is of Italian origin; the root \"casa\" means a house. The term casino may mean a small country villa, summerhouse, or social club. During the 19th century, the term \"casino\" came to include other public buildings where pleasurable activities took place; such edifices were usually built on the grounds of a larger Italian villa or palazzo, and were used to host civic town functions, including dancing, gambling, music listening, and sports; examples in Italy include Villa Farnese and Villa Giulia, and in the US the Newport Casino in Newport, Rhode Island. In modern-day Italian a \"casino\" is either a brothel (also called \"casa chiusa\", literally \"closed house\"), a mess, or a noisy environment, while a gaming house is spelt \"casinò\", with an accent.\n\nNot all casinos were used for gaming. The Catalina Casino, a famous landmark overlooking Avalon Harbor on Santa Catalina Island, California, has never been used for traditional games of chance, which were already outlawed in California by the time it was built. The Copenhagen Casino was a theatre, known for the mass public meetings often held in its hall during the 1848 Revolution, which made Denmark a constitutional monarchy. Until 1937, it was a well-known Danish theatre. The Hanko Casino in Hanko, Finland—one of that town's most conspicuous landmarks—was never used for gambling. Rather, it was a banquet hall for the Russian nobility which frequented this spa resort in the late 19th century and is now used as a restaurant.\n\nIn military and non-military usage in German and Spanish, a \"casino\" or \"kasino\" is an officers' mess.\n\nThe precise origin of gambling is unknown. It is generally believed that gambling in some form or another has been seen in almost every society in history. From the Ancient Greeks and Romans to Napoleon's France and Elizabethan England, much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.\n\nThe first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the Ridotto, established in Venice, Italy in 1638 by the Great Council of Venice to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry.\n\nIn American history, early gambling establishments were known as saloons. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: New Orleans, St. Louis, Chicago and San Francisco. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling became outlawed and banned by state legislation and social reformers of the time. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of Nevada. America's first legalized casinos were set up in those places. In 1976 New Jersey allowed gambling in Atlantic City, now America's second largest gambling city.\n\nMost jurisdictions worldwide have a minimum gambling age (16 to 21 years of age in most countries which permit the operation of casinos).\n\nCustomers gamble by playing games of chance, in some cases with an element of skill, such as craps, roulette, baccarat, blackjack, and video poker. Most games played have mathematically determined odds that ensure the house has at all times an overall advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of expected value, which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the \"house edge\". In games such as poker where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the rake. Casinos sometimes give out complimentary items or comps to gamblers.\n\n\"Payout\" is the percentage of funds (\"winnings\") returned to players.\n\nCasinos in the United States say that a player staking money won from the casino is \"playing with the house's money\".\n\nVideo Lottery Machines (slot machines) have become one of the most popular forms of gambling in casinos. investigative reports have started calling into question whether the modern-day slot-machine is addictive.\nCasino design—regarded as a psychological exercise—is an intricate process that involves optimising floor plan, décor and atmospherics to encourage gambling.\n\nFactors influencing gambling tendencies include sound, odour and lighting. Natasha Dow Schüll, an anthropologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, highlights the decision of the audio directors at Silicon Gaming to make its slot machines resonate in \"the universally pleasant tone of C, sampling existing casino soundscapes to create a sound that would please but not clash\".\n\nDr Alan Hirsch, founder of the Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago, studied the impact of certain scents on gamblers, discerning that a pleasant albeit unidentifiable odour released by Las Vegas slot machines generated about 50% more in daily revenue. He suggested that the scent acted as an aphrodisiac, causing a more aggressive form of gambling.\n\nCasino designer Roger Thomas is credited with implementing a successful, disruptive design for the Las Vegas Wynn Resorts casinos in 2008. He broke casino design convention by introducing natural sunlight and flora to appeal to women. Thomas put in skylights and antique clocks, defying the commonplace notion that a casino should be a timeless space.\n\nThe following lists major casino markets in the world with casino revenue of over US$1 billion as published in PricewaterhouseCoopers's report on \nthe outlook for the global casino market:\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, accumulated revenue of the biggest casino operator companies worldwide amounted almost US$55 billion in 2011. SJM Holdings Ltd. was the leading company in this field, and earned $9.7 billion in 2011, followed by Las Vegas Sands Corp. ($7.4 bn). The third-biggest casino operator company (based on revenue) was Caesars Entertainment, with revenue of US$6.2 bn.\n\nWhile there are casinos in many places, a few places have become well known specifically for gambling. Perhaps the place almost defined by its casino is Monte Carlo, but other places are known as gambling centers.\n\nMonte Carlo Casino, located in Monte Carlo city, in Monaco, is a famous casino and a tourist attraction popular with well-off visitors. The casino is mentioned in the song The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo as well as the film of the same name.\n\nMonte Carlo Casino has been depicted in many books, including Ben Mezrich's \"Busting Vegas\", where a group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology students beat the casino out of nearly $1 million. This book is based on real people and events; however, many of those events are contested by main character Semyon Dukach. Monte Carlo Casino has also been featured in multiple James Bond novels and films.\n\nCasinò di Campione is located in the tiny Italian enclave of Campione d'Italia, within Ticino, Switzerland. The casino was founded in 1917 as a site to gather information from foreign diplomats during the First World War. Today it is owned by the Italian government, and operated by the municipality. With gambling laws being less strict than in Italy and Switzerland, it is among most popular gambling destination besides Monte Carlo. The income from the casino is sufficient for the operation of Campione without the imposition of taxes, or obtaining of other revenue. In 2007, the casino moved into new premises of more than , making it the largest casino in Europe. The new casino was built alongside the old one, which dated from 1933 and has since been demolished.\n\nThe former Portuguese colony of Macau, a special administrative region of China since 1999, is a popular destination for visitors who wish to gamble. This started in Portuguese times, when Macau was popular with visitors from nearby British Hong Kong, where gambling was more closely regulated. The Venetian Macao is currently the largest casino in the world. Macau also surpassed Las Vegas as the largest gambling market in the world.\n\nThe Casino Estoril, located in the municipality of Cascais, on the Portuguese Riviera, near Lisbon, is the largest casino in Europe by capacity.\n\nDuring the Second World War, it was reputed to be a gathering point for spies, dispossessed royals, and wartime adventurers; it became an inspiration for Ian Fleming's James Bond 007 novel \"Casino Royale\".\n\nSingapore is an up-and-coming destination for visitors wanting to gamble, although there are currently only two casinos (both foreign owned), in Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands is the most expensive standalone casino in the world, at a price of US$8 billion, and is among the world's ten most expensive buildings. The Resorts World Sentosa has the world's largest oceanarium.\n\nWith currently over 1,000 casinos, the United States has the largest number of casinos in the world. The number continues to grow steadily as more states seek to legalize casinos. 40 states now have some form of casino gambling. Relatively small places such as Las Vegas are best known for gambling; larger cities such as Chicago are not defined by their casinos in spite of the large turnover.\n\nThe Las Vegas Valley has the largest concentration of casinos in the United States. Based on revenue, Atlantic City, New Jersey ranks second, and the Chicago region third.\n\nTop American casino markets by revenue (2015 annual revenues):\n\n\nThe Nevada Gaming Control Board divides Clark County, which is coextensive with the Las Vegas metropolitan area, into seven market regions for reporting purposes.\n\nNative American gaming has been responsible for a rise in the number of casinos outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City.\n\nGiven the large amounts of currency handled within a casino, both patrons and staff may be tempted to cheat and steal, in collusion or independently; most casinos have security measures to prevent this. Security cameras located throughout the casino are the most basic measure.\n\nModern casino security is usually divided between a physical security force and a specialized surveillance department. The physical security force usually patrols the casino and responds to calls for assistance and reports of suspicious or definite criminal activity. A specialized surveillance department operates the casino's closed circuit television system, known in the industry as the eye in the sky. Both of these specialized casino security departments work very closely with each other to ensure the safety of both guests and the casino's assets, and have been quite successful in preventing crime. Some casinos also have catwalks in the ceiling above the casino floor, which allow surveillance personnel to look directly down, through one way glass, on the activities at the tables and slot machines.\n\nWhen it opened in 1989, The Mirage was the first casino to use cameras full-time on all table games.\n\nIn addition to cameras and other technological measures, casinos also enforce security through rules of conduct and behavior; for example, players at card games are required to keep the cards they are holding in their hands visible at all times.\n\nOver the past few decades, casinos have developed many different marketing techniques for attracting and maintaining loyal patrons. Many casinos use a loyalty rewards program used to track players' spending habits and target their patrons more effectively, by sending mailings with free slot play and other promotions.\n\nCasinos have been linked to organised crime, with early casinos in Las Vegas originally dominated by the American Mafia and in Macau by Triad syndicates.\n\nAccording to some police reports, incidences of reported crime often double and triple in communities within three years of a casino opening. In a 2004 report by the US Department of Justice, researchers interviewed people who had been arrested in Las Vegas and Des Moines and found that the percentage of problem or pathological gamblers among the arrestees was three to five times higher than in the general population.\n\nIt has been said that economic studies that show a positive relationship between casinos and crime usually fail to consider the visiting population at risk when they calculate the crime rate in casino areas. Such studies thus count the crimes committed by visitors, but do not count visitors in the population measure, and this overstates the crime rates in casino areas. Part of the reason this methodology is used, despite it leading to an overstatement of crime rates is that reliable data on tourist count are often not available.\n\nThere has been some research into occupational health issues in the casino industry. Particular issues that have been reported on include alcohol abuse, second-hand tobacco smoke, and some musculo-skeletal problems associated with card-dealing.\n\n"}

Below are just several of the most popular examples.\n\nIn poker, for instance, a cheat may \"crimp\" one of the cards to mark off the exact location where he wishes his secret conspirator to cut the deck. Similarly, if the card cheat is not working with a confederate, he may bend one or more cards to force a cut upon an unsuspecting victim. In either case the deck will most likely be cut at the exact predetermined spot in the same way an old book always tends to open at the same page. \n\nAnother poker scenario (also popular in numerous other games) is to \"crimp\" some of the high-value cards during the early rounds. On subsequent rounds the cheat will be able to identify some of those cards during the deal. This enables the cheat to employ a second deal and deal some of those cards to the desired hand, or simply to identify some of the cards held by other players. In any event, the cheat has a mathematical edge over the other players.\n\nIn casino blackjack a crossroader may \"crimp\" all the 10-value cards. this will enable the cheat to sometimes identify the dealer's hole card (the dealer has one card face up, called the up card, and one card face down, called the hole card). In those instances the cheat(s) will know the dealer's total and play their hand(s) accordingly.\n"}

{"id": "1485648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1485648", "title": "Dubbing (music)", "text": "Dubbing (music)\n\nIn sound recording, dubbing is the transfer or copying of previously recorded audio material from one medium to another of the same or a different type. It may be done with a machine designed for this purpose, or by connecting two different machines: one to play back and one to record the signal. The purpose of dubbing may be simply to make multiple copies of audio programs, or it may be done to preserve programs on old media which are deteriorating and may otherwise be lost. \n\nOne type of dubbing device combines two different storage media, such as an audio cassette deck that incorporates a Compact Disc recorder. Such a device enables the transfer of audio programs from an obsolete medium to a widely used medium. It may also simply be used to transfer material between two types media which are popular in different settings, so that material originating in one type of environment can be used in another. An example of the latter would be the dubbing of a Digital BetaCam videocassette to DVD.\n\nAnother type of dubbing device is designed to rapidly produce many copies of a program. It may combine a single playback unit with multiple recording units to simultaneously create two, four, eight, sixteen, or more copies during the playback of a single original program. This type of device can often perform the copying process at many times the standard playback speed. Typical multiplexed dubbing decks of either analog (cassette) or digital (CD) programs can operate at 48 times the standard playback speed, thus producing complete copies of a program in sixty or ninety seconds. Sometimes this high-speed dubbing incurs some loss of quality compared to the best normal (1×) speed dub.\n\nThe verb \"dub\" as used here long predates and is unrelated to the Jamaican musical style dub music; the origin of both words stems from the dubplate. It is also different with the term dubbing, which is mostly a type of frottage dance usually found in the Caribbean clubs.\n\nSome of the earliest dubbings were made by the Victor Talking Machine Co. In 1916, Victor developed an acoustical dubbing process to create new masters from pressings where damage had occurred to the originals. Such dubbings are marked with the symbol “s/8” stamped in the inner rim. These are occasionally (but not always) noted in the New York files. Pressings made from these dubbed masters are sonically inferior to the originals.\n\n"}
{"id": "2179922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179922", "title": "Epic of Sundiata", "text": "Epic of Sundiata\n\nThe Sundiata Keita or Epic of Sundiata (also referred to as the Sundiata Epic or Sunjata Epic) is an epic poem of the Malinke people and tells the story of the hero Sundiata Keita (died 1255), the founder of the Mali Empire. The epic is an instance of oral tradition, going back to the 13th century and narrated by generations of griot poets or \"jeliw\" (\"djeli\"). There is no single or authoritative version. Material pertaining to the epic first began to be collected during the early 20th century in French Sudan, notably by the French elite school École William Ponty, resulting in the \"modern\" version of the tale as considered standard today, as published in \"novelistic\" form in French translation by Djibril Tamsir Niane in 1960 (English translation 1965).\n\nThe amount of historicity of the events portrayed in the epic is open to debate. There are some limited 14th-century Arabic historiographic sources available on the early history and of the Mali Empire, notably the records of Ibn Khaldun. Therefore, the evidence of oral tradition may be critical in reconstructing the historical events of the period. Oral tradition necessarily undergoes significant changes over the course of several centuries, but scholars have nevertheless attempted to pinpoint elements in the epic that might reflect historical events.\n\nWritten summaries of the epic existed in Arabic before 1890. During the 1890s, versions of the epic were collected by French officials and published in French and German translation beginning in 1898. Western-educated West Africans began to produce literary versions of the tale beginning in the 1930s. This was notably the case at the French elite school, École William Ponty, which staged a drama based on the story in 1937. This period represents the first interaction of the oral tradition with literacy and modernity, and the transformations undergone by the narrative in the context of the 1937 presentation ... eventually resulted in the form of the epic which became most influential in the 1940s and 1950s, before the first \"novelistic\" treatment by Niane (1960). The first line-by-line transcription of the epic as told by a griot was made in 1967.\n\nAs an oral historical epic, Sundiata conveys information not only about the history of the Mali Empire, but also about the culture of the Mande ethnic group. Mande family structures had two elements—constructive (\"badenya\") or destructive (\"fadenya\"). \"Fadenya\", or \"father-child-ness,\" is the rivalry between half-siblings, and is represented in the epic of Sundiata by the animosity between Sundiata, son of Sogolon, and Dankaran Touman, son of Sassouma (king Nare Marghan's first wife). The destructive forces of fadenya eventually cause Sundiata and his mother to be exiled from Mali, in the fear that Sassouma would hurt Sogolon's family. \"Badenya\", or \"mother-child-ness,\" is the affection between children of the same mother. This is represented in the epic by the support of Sundiata's sister, Kolonkan, in watching over him against Sassouma's attempts at witchcraft, and by his siblings' later support of him in his battle to reclaim Mali. Maternal support is also important for Sundiata to overcome his physical impairment and begin to walk in response to his mother's pleading. The importance of the mother is underscored by the narrator, who says \"the child is worth no more than the mother is worth.\" Significantly, Sundiata needed both the opposing forces of \"fadenya\" and \"badenya\" to fulfill his destiny, indicating that both elements are necessary to Mande culture .\n\nThe epic of Sundiata is still an integral part of Mande traditional culture and the story continues to be retold by griots and through masked ritual performances. Today the epic of Sundiata has also become part of the official national mythology of the republics of Mali, Gambia, Senegal and Guinea and is studied in history lessons in primary school curricula.\n\nIn the \"Epic of Sundiata\" (also spelled Son-Jara or Sundjata) Naré Maghann Konaté (also called Maghan Kon Fatta or Maghan the Handsome) was a Mandinka king who one day received a soothsaying hunter at his court. The hunter predicted that if Konaté married an ugly woman, she would give him a son who would one day be a mighty king. Naré Maghann Konaté was already married to Sassouma Bereté and had a son by her, Dankaran Toumani Keïta. However, when two Traoré hunters from the Do kingdom presented him an ugly, hunchbacked woman named Sogolon, he remembered the prophecy and married her. She soon gave birth to a son, Sundiata Keita, who was unable to walk throughout his childhood. Sassouma was jealous of the child and mother and would make fun of Sundiata for his inability to walk and the ugliness he inherited from his mother. Despite his physical weakness, the king still granted Sundiata his own griot at young age; this was in order to have them grow together and provide constant consultation as was custom.\n\nWith the death of Naré Maghann Konaté (c. 1224), his first son, Dankaran Tuman, assumed the throne despite Konaté's wishes that the prophecy be respected. Sundiata and his mother, who now had given birth to two daughters and adopted a second son from Konaté's third wife Namandjé, suffered the scorn of the new king and his mother. After an insult against Sogolon, Sundiata requested an iron rod from the blacksmith Nounfari, which broke when he tried to use it in order to pull himself upright and walk. Only when he used a branch of S'ra (African baobab or Adansonian tree) was he able to walk. In one version of the epic, Sundiata is able to walk after his father dies and his mother orders him to do so. He then becomes a great hunter. Nonetheless, the hatred of Sassouma Bereté and Dankaran Toumani Keita soon drove Sundiata, his mother, and his two sisters into exile in the Mema kingdom. In one version of the epic, Sundiata and his mother are not exiled. Sogolon feels that she and her son are in danger because of Sassouma's jealousy and left to keep them safe. Neighboring kingdoms are unwilling to harbor Sundiata and Sogolon in fear of what Sassouma and her son would do, but the Mema people take them in.\n\nWhile living in the Mema kingdom, Sundiata began to grow \"as strong as a lion\", and he fought with the greatest general of the Mema people, Moussa Tounkara. Sundiata became such a great warrior to the degree that he was made heir to the Mema throne. However, Sogolon encouraged him to \"fulfill his destiny\" and return to Mali to become king.\n\nMeanwhile, Soumaoro Kanté, cruel sorcerer king of Sosso, attacked the Mandinka kingdom, causing Dankaran Toumani to take flight in fear. Before reaching Mali, Soumaoro had conquered nine kingdoms in the Ghana Empire. He was a notoriously cruel leader. The oppressed Mandinka people then sent for the exiled Sundiata. Forging a coalition of neighboring small kingdoms, Sundiata waged a war against the Sosso, finally Sundiata was later crowned with the title \"Mansa,\" or \"king of kings\", as the first ruler of the Mali Empire. He soon set about organizing the nucleus of the empire, presenting the Gbara of nobles and notables at his coronation with an oral constitution known as the Kouroukan Fouga. His model for government would guide the empire into greatness. His exploits have even been compared to those of Alexander the Great by some griots.\n\n\n\n"}

He was being interviewed by Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy at the British Soap Awards 2016. He said that the episode would only feature the characters of Ste, Harry and Tony; a special constructed episode dubbed a \"three hander\". This was the show's second \"three hander\" stylised episode, the first airing in 2011, which focused on the characters of Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper), Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) and Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan).\n\nRichardson had revealed that the three-hander would feature his character, going cold turkey. Richardson had stated, \"We were filming for four days, mainly in Tony's flat, and I had to show Ste in a frantic comedown state, so it was pretty exhausting.\"\n\nRichardson said in an interview with \"What's on TV\", \"It’s very exciting and intense. We filmed a special episode with just Ste, his boyfriend, Harry [Parry Glasspool] and friend Tony [Nick Pickard] and it was so powerful. I made myself feel poorly for real. It’s unlike any episode of Hollyoaks you’ve ever seen. It’s a bit of a nod to the film Trainspotting. Harry and Tony are trying to fight for Ste’s life. They lock him in the flat to try and stop him getting more drugs and the comedown is horrific. The audience goes through it all with Ste.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"Radio Times\", Richardson was worried about the topic being controversial for the show's timeslot, he said \"I am scared. I'm thinking that there might be reshoots because it's too extreme. I've literally gone for it\".\n\n\"Episode 4429\" appeared in an article published via Digital Spy. It compiled ten unmissable soap storylines airing the week the episode was broadcast. Their reporter, Kilkelly, warned that viewers could expect harrowing scenes in the episode. Richardson received a considerable amount of praise via the social networking website Twitter. His performance mostly drew an emotional reaction from viewers conversing on the platform.\n\nDuncan Lindsay of \"Metro\" said \"Hollyoaks is often regarded as the underdog of the soap world – without much justification – but continually proves that it can deliver high octane and powerful drama as well as its rivals. The three hander on E4, led by emotive performances from Kieron Richardson, has shown, once more, that it deserves far more credit.\" Lindsay went on to say \"the episode flew by and left us gripped from start to finish.\" While he added \"The effective episode has revealed that Hollyoaks deserves the credit it gets but also highlights that living in the shadows of its equally strong counterparts remains the biggest injustice in the soap world.\" Lindsay had earlier stated \"With secrets from the past coming out, big decisions made and Ste at an all time low, it’s an unmissable visit to Hollyoaks that will answer the following questions. Will Ste come out the other side? Will Harry stand by him? Will the truth about Cameron’s involvement come out?\"\n\nDaniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy stated \"Bravo to Hollyoaks trio Kieron Richardson, Nick Pickard and Parry Glasspool, who pulled some of their most powerful performances out of the bag in their special episode tonight (July 13).\"\n\nCarl Greenwood of \"Daily Mirror\" stated \"Hollyoaks has made history with its first three-hander episode.\" Greenwood also reported that \"fans praise 'incredible' Kieron Richardson after emotionally powerful performance moves them to tears.\" He also stated, \"Actor Kieron Richardson knocked his performance out of the park as Ste as he veered from begging for help and viciously attacking his loved ones for trying to keep him from getting his next fix.\"\n\nThe episode has been described as \"a very emotional and hardhitting episode [sic].\" A reporter for \"Attitude\" said that \"Things get even darker for 'Starry' in tonight's special episode of the Channel 4 soap.\" \"Inside Soap\" included the episode in their \"pick of the day\" feature, with their writer describing \"very disturbing scenes\" and branding it an unmissable episode. They wrote about the episode \"It’s a very special episode of Hollyoaks tonight, with only three actors involved. Tony and Harry spend a night trying to help Ste through his drug withdrawal – so prepare yourselves for some very disturbing scenes as Ste lashes out at the people who love him. You really mustn’t miss this!\"\n\nRachel McGrath of \"Huffington Post\" wrote \"In one of the most emotionally-charged scenes, Ste - spurred on by desperation to feed his habit - attacked Harry, which brought back memories of the violence he put his ex Amy Barnes through.\"\n"}

{"id": "8611599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8611599", "title": "False ending", "text": "False ending\n\nA false ending has two contexts: in literature, film and video games it is a narrative device where the plot seems to be heading to its conclusion, but in reality, there's still more to the story; in a musical composition, however, it is a complete stop of the work or song for one or more seconds before continuing.\n\nThe presence of a false ending can be anticipated through a number of ways: the medium itself might betray that it isn't the true ending (i.e. it's only halfway into a book or a song, a film's listed running time hasn't fully elapsed, only half the world has been explored in a video game, etc.), making only stories with indeterminate running length or a multi-story structure able to pull this off effectively; another indicator is the feeling that too much of the story is incomplete when the false ending comes, making it feel like there has to be more.\n\nIn \"L.A. Confidential\" , it seems like the criminal case that the movie revolves around is completely closed with no loose ends until one of the witnesses admits that she lied about important details to give more importance towards the trial of the people who raped her, exposing a cover-up conspiracy. In \"\", the director keeps using editing techniques that are indicative of endings in scenes that could be used as such, but continues until the movie finally ends. \"Spider-Man 3\" has two false endings. Another example is in \"The Simpsons Movie\", where, at a very climatic stage in the film, the screen fades away and says \"To be continued\", which is then followed by the word \"Immediately.\"\n\nSome movies come to a formal ending, followed by the rolling of the credits, which is almost universally used to indicate that the film has ended, only to have the actors reappear in one or more mid-credits scenes. In comedy films, these sequences may be bloopers or outtakes. In other types of films, the mid-credit scenes may continue the narrative set out in the movie. The Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have become notorious for this, in some cases featuring a mid-credits scene and an end-credits scene in the same movie.\n\nIn the police comedy \"Hot Fuzz\" (2007), two police officers realize that a cult is controlling their town. After the two officers defeat the head of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance and his members, who have been causing problems in the town, the pair are celebrating their success at the police station, and the movie appears to be wrapping up. Then a surviving member of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance enters the station and shoots an old musket, which triggers an old-fashioned mine.\n\nSome examples in video games include \"Final Fantasy VI\" and \"Wild ARMs\". Both involve confrontations with the major antagonists at what seems like their final lairs, but instead a crisis occurs and the story continues. A third is in \"\", upon sinking the \"Druna Skass\" a second time (Which can only happen if the player plays though the game again, as the game resets itself to the beginning if you sink it once), the player is greeted by another supership, that looks just like the \"Druna Skass\". Yet another example is the survival horror game \"Obscure II\", in which the player must wait until the credits roll to their conclusion before gameplay resumes.\n\nRole-playing video games are notorious for having such plot devices. It usually involves the game's main antagonist being defeated, only for a previously mentioned character to be revealed as the \"real\" villain. One example is \"\", in which the main character is apparently about to have a boss fight with the former villain Zant, but Zant reveals he has been working for another Villain.\nAnother example is \"\" where after you defeat Medusa, credits roll but are quickly interrupted by Hades, the villain for the rest of the game.\n\nIn video games, it is difficult to use the false ending device effectively. Nevertheless, in the hands of a skilled designer, there are several methods that allow it to be done. In several video games, such as those with multiple playable characters and story lines, the game may appear to end after defeating a difficult boss, or clearing what appears to be the \"Final\" level, complete with credits, an outro, and a return to the start screen. These endings are different from bad endings, as everything may appear to be resolved. However, fulfilling conditions such as clearing all the storylines, reloading the save file, or reaching the \"ending\" in a New Game+ mode may give the player the option to continue on to the real ending.\n\nAn example of this is \"Sonic Adventure\", and its sequel \"Sonic Adventure 2\". In the former, while there are six stories to play, only the main character's, Sonic's is the most complete. The other characters' stories are simply side-stories. However, if \"all\" of the stories are completed, a final story appears that wraps up the game and acts as the \"true\" ending. In the latter, there are two stories to play, one for the heroes, and one for the villains. Of note is the plot device is hidden in a false Chaos Emerald being used that would destroy the space colony in which the villain Doctor Eggman is using as a base. It is at first implied that Eggman took the false Emerald, but in reality, when the last story is played, again, after the two normal stories are completed, a true conclusion is offered.\n\nAnother example could be the survival horror game \"Resident Evil 2\", where, depending on your choice, you get to play with one of the two characters and get a certain ending for one of them to later discover, when you finish playing the second path with the second character, you fight the real final boss and the \"true\" ending (That may vary depending of which character you have chosen first) is shown. The main difference between both of the \"true\" endings are that places and times are exchanged, as well as the final dialogue from the game.\n\n\"The Consequence\", the second Kidman DLC for 2014's \"The Evil Within\", features a secret false ending in a similar manner to those shown in the \"Resident Evil\" franchise. At one point, Juli Kidman encounters the brain of the game's main antagonist, Ruben Victoriano, sealed inside a glass container hooked up to the STEM system in Beacon Hospital. Should the player choose to shoot the container and break it, the game cuts to black, then begins the credits sequence, cutting short on a postcard depicting Juli, Joseph and Sebastian on a postcard, before promptly returning to the game as Kidman exclaims \"What the fuck?!\", indicating the whole sequence was a hallucination.\n\nFalse endings are a known device in classical music. Josef Haydn was fond of them, for example inducing applause at the wrong place in the finales of his String Quartet, Op. 33 No. 2 (nicknamed \"The Joke\") and Symphony No. 90. The first movement of Prokoviev's Classical Symphony contains false endings.\nIn music, a number of rock and pop songs use false endings in which the music is arranged so that the song appears to be coming to its ending (e.g., reaching a final cadence on the chord of the home key and then stopping), but then the music recommences. Examples include The Rascals' \"Good Lovin'\"; The Four Tops' \"Bernadette\", \"White Room\" by Cream; \"The Peace!\" by Morning Musume; \"Thank You\" by Led Zeppelin; \"Rain\" by The Beatles; \"Monday, Monday\" by The Mamas & the Papas; and \"But You Know I Love You\" by The First Edition. Another notable example of a musical false ending is \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\" by Bryan Adams - because the original song was six and a half minutes long, the false ending became the end of the single/video edit of the song (the album version had a fadeout ending).\n\nIn addition, several other songs have also had false endings, such as \"Angels\" by Amy Grant, a #1 Christian hit in 1984. Another example is \"Keep On Dancing\", a 1965 Top 10 hit for the group The Gentrys from Memphis, Tennessee. In both songs, there is a pause of two seconds before the music starts all over again. Also, \"When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)\" by The Beach Boys, has a sudden stop and resumes 1 second later as the band counts numbers of years of age until the song fades, counting from 19 to 30. The Alice in Chains track \"Rain When I Die\" has a fade-out false ending lasting about 20 seconds, then the music comes back, and then it fades once more, thus providing the real ending. \"Weather with You\" by Crowded House appears to be ending and then another small instrumental is followed by a final chorus.\n\n"}

{"id": "34428407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34428407", "title": "History of Hungarian animation", "text": "History of Hungarian animation\n\nThe history of Hungarian animation begins in 1914 and carries through to the modern day. Starting with short promotional cartoons prior to the two World Wars, Hungarian animation underwent a sporadic and halting development during the turbulent war years which were characterized in large part by the emigration of much of the field's top talent. This exodus slowed dramatically during the 1950s when the Hungarian Communist Party took power and the Iron Curtain took shape.\n\nWith Communism came nationalization of the Hungarian animation studio—a fact that was to prove a mixed blessing for the nascent industry. While political pressures would strongly dictate the kinds of topics that animation could cover in the early years, state funding meant that even the relatively small postwar nation would be able to prove itself on the international stage. Indeed, subsequent to the 1956 revolution, the softening effects of Goulash Communism helped enable artists to begin to express themselves such that by the late 1970s, Pannónia Film Stúdió would rank among the top 5 major cartoon studios alongside Walt Disney, Hanna-Barbera, Soyuzmultfilm, and Toei.\n\nWith the end of Communism in 1989, state control of the animation industry dropped away and market forces prompted the rise of numerous independent animation studios. Lacking state funding and receiving mixed international response, Hungarian animation studios today have had to develop financing strategies consisting largely of working as production and development companies performing labor-intensive animation activities such as compositioning and inking for foreign studios. Despite this, Hungarian films continue to be produced every few years.\n\nThe history of Hungarian animation extends from its origin in István Kató Kiszly's 1914 cut-out caricatures to the modern time. Although a few boldly experimental films were made in the early years, it would not be until the 1930s that actual animation studios would be formed (under figures like Gyula Macskássy and János Halász) to produce promotional material in the form of newsreels and advertisements. International conflicts during both world wars as well as turbulent political climates in the pre-Iron Curtain period led to the emigration of many of Hungary's animation artists who famously established themselves in places like France, the U.K., and America. During the Communist era, all animation efforts are nationalized first as Magyar Szinkronfilmgyártó Vállalat in 1948 and later as Pannónia Film Stúdió in 1959. State control of animation on the one hand constrained artistic freedom of expression while simultaneously ensuring the survival of the medium.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the first modern generation of Hungarian animators came to prominence, creating primarily short animations depicting the Hungarian folk tales and legends that would be a politically safe mainstay of Hungarian animation output throughout the Communist era. This generation would be responsible for creating the first colored animation. A second generation of animators would emerge in the 1960s under the less repressive system of Goulash Communism, and sociopolitical sentiment was for the first time gently hinted at as cartoons developed philosophical themes characterized by morbidity and black humor. Foreign animation studios began to reach out to Pannónia Film Stúdió during this period to subcontract some of the more laborious elements of cartoon production such as compositioning and inking. This introduced the concept of cartoon series/serials, and soon a number of Hungarian serials were created introducing the country's first recognizable cartoon character stars. This period also saw the production of the first adult animation. The 1970s saw the rise of a third generation of animators even more intent on commentary on the social conditions in the country. Animations during this period were often marked by a muted subsurface emphasis on anxiety and a claustrophobic fear of persecution while the animation works of older (first and second generation) animators tended to emphasize morality and a development of the grotesque. This third generation would see the emergence of the country's first feature-length films as Pannónia Film Stúdió rose to international renown as one of the top 5 major cartoon studios alongside Walt Disney, Hanna-Barbera, Soyuzmultfilm, and Toei.\n\nThe 1980s would prove to be a peak of Hungarian animation efforts. Increasingly bold use of irony and allegory portrayed the Hungarian condition under Communist rule and during this period a number of Hungarian films received high accolades and prestigious awards including Ferenc Rofusz' 1981 Oscar for \"A Légy\" (\"The Fly\"). The decade would also mark a renaissance in technical experimentation with the exploration of many non-traditional graphic media such as plasticine, sand, coal, textiles, and computer animation. During this period the first feature-length films based on serials were created and proved to be quite popular. In 1989, Communist rule was cast off and with it State control of the animation arts in 1990. Due to free market pressures, a number of independent animation studios sprang up in the wake. The novel issue of commercial financing proved to be a complex one as new studios struggled to make ends meet. A variety of solutions were adopted ranging from the active courting of foreign contract work, to specialization in the labor-intensive traditional hand-animation forms, to employee ownership. In 2002, the new Hungarian government began to take a role in the medium as well with funding from the Ministry of National Cultural Heritage going toward the development of further animations of Hungarian folk tales and legends which since the Communist era have become a source of national pride.\n\n\nThe earliest period of Hungarian animation was marked by experimentation and the development of the first animation studio headed by pioneers, Gyula Macskássy and János Halász. Animations were primarily promotional in nature although throughout the 1930s more and more complex narrative structures were developed. Between 1932 and 1945, 150 promotional cartoons are produced including \"Családi kávépótló\" (\"Family Coffee Substitute\"), \"Estétől reggelig\" (\"Evening to Morning\"), \"A láthatatlan vendég\" (\"Invisible Visitor\"), \"Zeusz inkognitóban\" (\"Zeus in Cognito\"), \"Vidám suszterinas\" (\"The hilarious shoemaker's boy\"), \"Szerencsés flottás\" (\"Lucky Jim\"), and \"Izzó szerelem\" (\"Glowing Love\") During the lead-up to World War II and the turbulent war years, Hungary saw an exodus of artists and filmmakers, particularly among the Hungarian Jewish population. Seeking to continue their art in less politically fraught climates, several Hungarian cartoonists began to establish studios abroad.\n\n\nFolktale animation is common and this period sees a rise in Hungarian animation establishing such animators as József Nepp, Attila Dargay, Tibor Csermák, Gábor Kovásznai, József Gémes, Szabolcs Szabó, György Várnai, Marcell Jankovics, Péter Szoboszlay, Zsolt Richly, Sándor Reisenbüchler, Béla Vajda, Tamás Szabó Sipos, János Mata, and also puppet animators like Ottó Foky and István Imre.\n\n\nForeign animation teams begin to reach out to Pannónia Film Studio as a way to cut costs on some of the more labor-intensive aspects of cartoon production. In domestic productions, however, with the artistic community under strain from an authoritarian Communist government, morbidity and black humor become more common as cartoons were used to hint at and reflect the philosophy and conditions of the day. Due to Western influence, such cartoon serials emerged as Gyula Macskássy and György Várnai's \"Peti és a gépember\" (\"Peti and the Robot\"), \"Marci és a Cső\" (\"Marci in the Jungle\"), \"Vili és Bütyök\" (\"Vili and Bütyök\"), \"Üzenet a jövőből\" (\"Messages from the Future\"), \"Kérem a következőt!\" (\"Next, Please!\"), \"Varjúdombi mesék\" (\"Tales from Crow Hill\"), Tamás Szabó Sipos's \"Magyarázom...\" (\"Let Me Explain...\"), and Ottó Foky's \"Egy világhírű vadász emlékiratai\" (\"The Magic Snake\"). With the emergence of cartoon serials came the country's first recognizable cartoon character stars such as Gergő, Peti, Gustav, Frakk, Kukori and Kotkoda, Mirr-Murr, Elek Mekk, Dr. Bubó, Mikrobi, Kockásfülű nyúl, TV Maci, and Mézga család, each of whom featured in several cartoons. Animation for adult entertainment also emerged during this period with such series as Gyula Macskássy and György Várnai's \"Ember és ember\" (\"Man and Human\").\n\nWith the artistic community still under government pressure, a third generation of films is marked by a muted subsurface emphasis on anxiety and a claustrophobic fear of persecution. Older (first and second generation) animators tended to emphasize morality and a development of the grotesque.\n\n\nA decade considered to have been responsible for the peak of Hungarian animation, the 1980s would see increasingly bold use of irony and allegory in portraying the Hungarian condition under Communist rule and would mark a renaissance in technical experimentation with the exploration of many non-traditional graphic media. Of particular note, several new experimental serials emerged during this period including Sándor Békési's \"Vázák meséi\" (\"Tales of Vases\"), Csaba Varga's \"Szekrénymesék\" (\"The Wardrobe's Tales\"), and plasticine animations including Csaba Varga's \"Auguszta\" (\"Augusta\") and Ferenc Cakó's \"Zénó\". Feature-length films were made of a number of serials from the 1960s and 1970s, including Szabolcs Szabó and József Haui's \"Vízipók-csodapók\" (\"Water-Spider, Wonder-Spider\"), Ottó Foky's \"Misi Mókus kalandjai\" (\"The Adventures of Sam the Squirrel\"), Attila Dargay's \"Vuk\", and Pál Tóth's \"Leo és Fred\" (\"Leo and Fred\"). New series were also launched including Attila Dargay's \"Pom-pom meséi\" (\"Tales of Pom Pom\") and \"A nagy hó-hó-horgász\" (\"The Grrreat Angler\"), Ferenc Cakó's \"Sebaj Tóbiás\" (\"Never Mind Toby\"), László Ujváry Jr.'s \"Mesék Mátyás királyról\" (\"Tales about King Matthias\"), Marcell Jankovics' \"Mondák a magyar történelemből\" (\"Hungarian Historical Legends\"), Zsolt Richly's \"Fabulák\" (\"Fables\") and \"Kíváncsi Fáncsi\" (\"Curious Fáncsi\"), Tibor Hernádi's \"Animália\" (\"Animalia\"), Líviusz Gyulai's \"Tinti kalandjai\" (\"Tinti's Adventures\") and \"Kentaurfi kalandjai\" (\"Adventures of Fanny the Elephant\"), Tamás Baksa's \"Trombi és a tűzmanó\" (\"Trombi and the Fiery Imp\"), and Ferenc Varsányi's \"Csepke\" (\"Droplet\"). Animators making a name for themselves in this period included Ferenc Varsányi, Miklós Kaim, István Kovács, Elek Lisziák, Zsolt Richly, Kati Macskássy, Béla Ternovszky, Tibor Hernádi, László Ujváry, Ferenc Cakó, László Hegyi Füstös, Csaba Varga, Ágnes Pásztor, Mária Horváth, István Orosz, and Ferenc Rofusz.\n\n\nThe end of the century saw the end of Communism in Hungary. Although state support for Hungary's one animation studio (Pannónia Film Stúdió) came to an end, the free market quickly prompted the development of a number of independent animation studios. In order to gain funding in the absence of the state, studios such as Kecskemétfilm Kft turn to employee ownership strategies while other studios work primarily as contractors for foreign markets doing work such as compositioning and inking. Yet other studios such as the American-Hungarian joint venture Studio 2 have focused instead on traditional hand-drawn cell animation techniques to preserve this now niche animation style. Among other animation studios that were founded since the withdrawal of state control are included Pannónia rajzfilmgyártók, Videovox, Funny Film, Animex, Dana Film, Reflex, Puppet Film, Aladin stúdió, Firka, and the German-Hungarian joint venture Loonland. Several feature-length films have been released since the late 1980s including \"Albert mondja...\" (\"Albert Says...\") and \"Majmok kastélya\" (\"Monkey Castle\") among others. Animators who have risen to prominence since the end of the Communist era include Péter Szoboszlay, László Hegyi Füstös, Mária Horváth, Líviusz Gyulai, István Orosz, Dóra Keresztes, László Haris, Péter Molnár, Zoltán Szilágyi Varga, Árpád Miklós, Gizella Neuberger, Béla Weisz, and László Ujváry.\n\n"}

Generals and other distinguished Poles graced its stage including, in 1976, the future Pope John Paul II.\n\nIn 1978, the hall was converted to a rock music venue by future Peppermint Lounge promoters Tom Goodkind and Frank Roccio, who after a year began to share promotional efforts with a \"Club 57\" crew headed by Jane Friedman and Louis Tropia. Goodkind and Roccio brought in acts such as the B-52s, Talking Heads, the Ramones and, with Friedman and Tropia, a wealth of British bands, establishing the venue as a premier American location for punk and new wave.\n\nThe venue was reopened by Chuck Terzella in October 1983, with management by Frank Gallagher and the English DJ Andy Dunkley, presenting reggae and other ethnic music, plus college rock, proclaiming in their ads \"We don't have video\". Terzella's club filed for bankruptcy in December 1985, and closed in June 1986.\n\nChris Williamson, who already promoted the punk and hard rock oriented \"Rock Hotel\" nights at the Ritz, then took over in November 1986. He began programming alternative rock occasionally using the designation \"Rock Motel\". A New Year's Eve Rock Hotel show with The Dictators turned nasty after the band initiated a food fight and a bouncer lost his cool and beat some patrons. Plans by the Polish Veterans to convert the building to condos fell through. They had to spend $25,000 on bringing the venue up to firecode before, in April 1987, Chris Williamson re-opened the club, featuring improved sound and lights, with an inaugural multi-night stand of Big Audio Dynamite. Williamson continued putting on shows into 1988—including hosting the popular \"Milky Way\" hip hop nights—but, as Irving Place gentrified, there was increasing local opposition to the hall. A plan by Williamson to present a play in the winter of 1988 fell through and, in December 1988, it was announced that the club would close and be demolished and turned into condos. The last show was The Ramones on December 31, 1988. Dee Dee Ramone praised the venue: \"It was funky without being a dump.\"\n\nRon Delsener took on management in the early 1990s. Live Nation, a spinoff of Clear Channel Communications, renovated and reopened Irving Plaza under the name \"Fillmore New York At Irving Plaza\" on April 11, 2007, reviving the name of the former Fillmore East in Manhattan's East Village, which had been open from 1968 to 1971. However, in May 2010 Live Nation conceded that the new name had not caught on and due to \"unrelenting demand\" the name \"Irving Plaza\" would be restored as from June 23, 2010. A replica of the original marquee has been commissioned.\n\nIn September 2010, Irving Plaza became the venue for the services of Hillsong Church New York.\n\nOn February 14, 2015, Paul McCartney played a surprise show announced only that morning on Twitter.\n\nOn May 25, 2016, 4 people were shot at a T.I. concert before T.I. took the stage.

He was the co-founder and CEO of Capital City Distribution, a distributor of comic books and related material, from 1980 to 1996. In 2001, he founded the online trade magazine \"ICv2\" and acts as its CEO.\n\nWhile attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison for a masters degree in sociology, Griepp worked in the comics division of Wisconsin Independent News Distributors, located in Madison, Wisconsin. When the company was purchased by Big Rapids Distribution in 1978, Griepp and his coworker John Davis were absorbed as well. They both lost their jobs when Big Rapids went bankrupt in 1980, and Griepp drew unemployment benefits for two months.\n\nAt that time, Davis approached him to propose a partnership as comic book distributors. They founded Capital City Distribution in April 1980 when Griepp was 26 years old. With Griepp as CEO, the new business absorbed some of Big Rapids' assets and grew to be the largest comic book distributor in the United States. Griepp crafted a monthly newsletter, \"Internal Correspondence\", which was sent to all of their retail customers. Their main rival, Diamond Comics Distributors, overtook it in size through acquisitions in 1988. That year, Capital City and Diamond represented at least 70% of the comic book distribution market. \n\nWhen trade magazine \"Hero Illustrated\" published a list of the 100 most important people in the comic industry in mid-1993, Griepp was ranked tenth because of his push for innovation in distribution technology. Griepp encouraged retailers to enter the computer age and was the first to offer online reordering options. His position fell to number 19 the following year because of turmoil caused by a bursting bubble in the industry. Diamond acquired Capital City in 1996 during a period of industry consolidation.\n\nAfter next working as a publishing and retailing consultant, in 1999–2000 Griepp ran Next Planet Over, a San Francisco-based e-commerce company.\n\nIn 2001, he founded \"ICv2\" (\"Internal Correspondence version 2\"), an online trade magazine which also conducts annual industry conferences. Comic professionals consider his annual white paper on comic sales the industry standard. Since then, Griepp has served as a board member for organizations such as the parent company of the digital comics distribution platform comiXology, the non-profit Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, and Free Comic Book Day. These roles led to him being ranked number 92 on \"Bleeding Cool Magazine\" 2012 \"Top 100 Power List\" for the comic industry.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "232692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232692", "title": "Music hall", "text": "Music hall\n\nMusic hall is a type of British theatrical entertainment that was popular from the early Victorian era, beginning around 1850. It ended, arguably, after the First World War, when the halls rebranded their entertainment as Variety. Perceptions of a distinction in Britain between bold and scandalous Victorian \"Music Hall\" and subsequent, more respectable \"Variety\" differ. Music hall involved a mixture of popular songs, comedy, speciality acts, and variety entertainment. The term is derived from a type of theatre or venue in which such entertainment took place. American vaudeville was in some ways analogous to British music hall, featuring rousing songs and comic acts.\n\nOriginating in saloon bars within public houses during the 1830s, music hall entertainment became increasingly popular with audiences. So much so, that during the 1850s some public houses were demolished, and specialised music hall theatres developed in their place. These theatres were designed chiefly so that people could consume food and alcohol and smoke tobacco in the auditorium while the entertainment took place. This differed somewhat from the conventional type of theatre, which until then seated the audience in stalls with a separate bar-room. Major music halls were based around London. Early examples included: the Canterbury Music Hall in Lambeth, Wilton's Music Hall in Tower Hamlets, and The Middlesex in Drury Lane, otherwise known as the Old Mo.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the halls cried out for many new and catchy songs. As a result, professional songwriters were enlisted to provide the music for a plethora of star performers, such as Marie Lloyd, Dan Leno, Little Tich, and George Leybourne. All manner of other entertainment was performed: male and female impersonators, lions comiques, mime artists and impressionists, trampoline acts, and comic pianists (such as John Orlando Parry and George Grossmith) were just a few of the many types of entertainments the audiences could expect to find over the next forty years.\n\nThe Music Hall Strike of 1907 was an important industrial conflict. It was a dispute between artists and stage hands on one hand, and theatre managers on the other, culminating in a strike. The halls had recovered by the start of the First World War and were used to stage charity events in aid of the war effort. Music hall entertainment continued after the war, but became less popular due to upcoming jazz, swing, and big-band dance music acts. Licensing restrictions had also changed, and drinking was banned from the auditorium. A new type of music hall entertainment had arrived, in the form of variety, and many music hall performers failed to make the transition. They were deemed old-fashioned, and with the closure of many halls, music hall entertainment ceased and modern-day variety began.\n\nMusic hall in London had its origins in the 18th century. It grew with the entertainment provided in the new style saloon bars of public houses during the 1830s. These venues replaced earlier semi-rural amusements provided by fairs and suburban pleasure gardens such as Vauxhall Gardens and the Cremorne Gardens. These latter became subject to urban development and became fewer and less popular.\n\nThe saloon was a room where for an admission fee or a greater price at the bar, singing, dancing, drama or comedy was performed. The most famous London saloon of the early days was the Grecian Saloon, established in 1825, at The Eagle (a former tea-garden), 2 Shepherdess Walk, off the City Road in east London. According to John Hollingshead, proprietor of the Gaiety Theatre, London (originally the Strand Music Hall), this establishment was \"the father and mother, the dry and wet nurse of the Music Hall\". Later known as the Grecian Theatre, it was here that Marie Lloyd made her début at the age of 14 in 1884. It is still famous because of an English nursery rhyme, with the somewhat mysterious lyrics:\nUp and down the City RoadIn and out The EagleThat's the way the money goesPop goes the weasel.\n\nAnother famous \"song and supper\" room of this period was Evans Music-and-Supper Rooms, 43 King Street, Covent Garden, established in the 1840s by W.H. Evans. This venue was also known as 'Evans Late Joys' – Joy being the name of the previous owner. Other song and supper rooms included the Coal Hole in The Strand, the Cyder Cellars in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden and the Mogul Saloon in Drury Lane.\n\nThe music hall as we know it developed from such establishments during the 1850s and were built in and on the grounds of public houses. Such establishments were distinguished from theatres by the fact that in a music hall you would be seated at a table in the auditorium and could drink alcohol and smoke tobacco whilst watching the show. In a theatre, by contrast, the audience was seated in stalls and there was a separate bar-room. An exception to this rule was the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton (1841) which somehow managed to evade this regulation and served drinks to its customers. Though a theatre rather than a music hall, this establishment later hosted music hall variety acts.\n\nThe establishment often regarded as the first true music hall was the Canterbury, 143 Westminster Bridge Road, Lambeth built by Charles Morton, afterwards dubbed \"the Father of the Halls\", on the site of a skittle alley next to his pub, the Canterbury Tavern. It opened on 17 May 1852 and was described by the musician and author Benny Green as being \"the most significant date in all the history of music hall\". The hall looked like most contemporary pub concert rooms, but its replacement in 1854 was of then unprecedented size. It was further extended in 1859, later rebuilt as a variety theatre and finally destroyed by German bombing in 1942.\n\nAnother early music hall was The Middlesex, Drury Lane (1851). Popularly known as the 'Old Mo', it was built on the site of the Mogul Saloon. Later converted into a theatre it was demolished in 1965. The New London Theatre stands on its site.\n\nSeveral large music halls were built in the East End. These included the London Music Hall, otherwise known as The Shoreditch Empire, 95–99 Shoreditch High Street, (1856–1935). This theatre was rebuilt during 1894 by Frank Matcham, the architect of the Hackney Empire. Another in this area was the Royal Cambridge Music Hall, 136 Commercial Street (1864–1936). Designed by William Finch Hill (the designer of the Britannia theatre in nearby Hoxton), it was rebuilt after a fire in 1898.\n\nThe construction of Weston's Music Hall, High Holborn (1857), built up on the site of the Six Cans and Punch Bowl Tavern by the licensed victualler of the premises, Henry Weston, signalled that the West End was fruitful territory for the music hall. During 1906 it was rebuilt as a variety theatre and renamed as the Holborn Empire. It was closed as a result of German action in the Blitz on the night of 11–12 May 1941 and the building was pulled down in 1960. Significant West End music halls include:\n\nOther large suburban music halls included:\n\nA noted music hall entrepreneur of this time was Carlo Gatti who built a music hall, known as Gatti's, at Hungerford Market in 1857. He sold the music hall to South Eastern Railway in 1862, and the site became Charing Cross railway station. With the proceeds from selling his first music hall, Gatti acquired a restaurant in Westminster Bridge Road, opposite The Canterbury music hall. He converted the restaurant into a second Gatti's music hall, known as \"Gatti's-in-the-Road\", in 1865. It later became a cinema. The building was badly damaged in the Second World War, and was demolished in 1950. In 1867, he acquired a public house in Villiers Street named \"The Arches\", under the arches of the elevated railway line leading to Charing Cross station. He opened it as another music hall, known as \"Gatti's-in-The-Arches\". After his death his family continued to operate the music hall, known for a period as the Hungerford or Gatti's Hungerford Palace of Varieties.\n\nIt became a cinema in 1910, and the Players' Theatre in 1946.\n\nBy 1865, there were 32 music halls in London seating between 500 and 5,000 people plus an unknown, but large, number of smaller venues.\n\nIn 1878, numbers peaked, with 78 large music halls in the metropolis and 300 smaller venues. Thereafter numbers declined due to stricter licensing restrictions imposed by the Metropolitan Board of Works and LCC, and because of commercial competition between popular large suburban halls and the smaller venues, which put the latter out of business.\n\nA new era of variety theatre was developed by the rebuilding of the London Pavilion in 1885. Contemporary accounts noted:\nOne of the most famous of these new palaces of pleasure in the West End was the Empire, Leicester Square, built as a theatre in 1884 but acquiring a music hall licence in 1887. Like the nearby Alhambra this theatre appealed to the men of leisure by featuring alluring ballet dancers and had a notorious promenade which was the resort of courtesans. Another spectacular example of the new variety theatre was the Tivoli in the Strand built 1888–90 in an eclectic neo-Romanesque style with Baroque and Moorish-Indian embellishments. \"The Tivoli\" became a brand name for music-halls all over the British Empire. During 1892, the Royal English Opera House, which had been a financial failure in Shaftesbury Avenue, applied for a music hall licence and was converted by Walter Emden into a grand music hall and renamed the Palace Theatre of Varieties, managed by Charles Morton. Denied by the newly created LCC permission to construct the promenade, which was such a popular feature of the Empire and Alhambra, the Palace compensated in the way of adult entertainment by featuring apparently nude women in tableaux vivants, though the concerned LCC hastened to reassure patrons that the girls who featured in these displays were actually wearing flesh-toned body stockings and were not naked at all.\n\nOne of the grandest of these new halls was the Coliseum Theatre built by Oswald Stoll in 1904 at the bottom of St Martin's Lane. This was followed by the London Palladium (1910) in Little Argyll Street.\n\nBoth were designed by the prolific Frank Matcham. As music hall grew in popularity and respectability, and as the licensing authorities exercised ever firmer regulation, the original arrangement of a large hall with tables at which drink was served, changed to that of a drink-free auditorium. The acceptance of music hall as a legitimate cultural form was established by the first Royal Variety Performance before King George V during 1912 at the Palace Theatre. However, consistent with this new respectability the best-known music hall entertainer of the time, Marie Lloyd, was not invited, being deemed too \"saucy\" for presentation to the monarchy.\n\nThe development of syndicates controlling a number of theatres, such as the Stoll circuit, increased tensions between employees and employers. On 22 January 1907, a dispute between artists, stage hands and managers of the Holborn Empire worsened. Strikes in other London and suburban halls followed, organised by the Variety Artistes' Federation. The strike lasted for almost two weeks and was known as the \"Music Hall War\". It became extremely well known, and was advocated enthusiastically by the main spokesmen of the trade union and Labour movement – Ben Tillett and Keir Hardie for example. Picket lines were organized outside the theatres by the artistes, while in the provinces theatre management attempted to oblige artistes to sign a document promising never to join a trade union.\n\nThe strike ended in arbitration, which satisfied most of the main demands, including a minimum wage and maximum working week for musicians.\n\nSeveral music hall entertainers such as Marie Dainton, Marie Lloyd, Arthur Roberts, Joe Elvin and Gus Elen were strong advocates of the strike, though they themselves earned enough not to be concerned personally in a material sense. Lloyd explained her advocacy:\n\nWorld War I may have been the high-water mark of music hall popularity. The artists and composers threw themselves into rallying public support and enthusiasm for the war effort. Patriotic music hall compositions such as \"Keep the Home Fires Burning\" (1914), \"Pack up Your Troubles\" (1915), \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\" (1914) and \"We Don't Want to Lose You (but we think you ought to Go)\", were sung by music hall audiences, and sometimes by soldiers in the trenches.\n\nMany songs promoted recruitment (\"All the boys in khaki get the nice girls\", 1915); others satirised particular elements of the war experience. \"What did you do in the Great war, Daddy\" (1919) criticised profiteers and slackers; Vesta Tilley's \"I've got a bit of a blighty one\" (1916) showed a soldier delighted to have a wound just serious enough to be sent home. The rhymes give a sense of grim humour (\"When they wipe my face with sponges / and they feed me on blancmanges / I'm glad I've got a bit of a blighty one\").\n\nTilley became more popular than ever during this time, when she and her husband, Walter de Frece, managed a military recruitment drive. In the guise of characters like 'Tommy in the Trench' and 'Jack Tar Home from Sea', Tilley performed songs such as \"The army of today's all right\" and \"Jolly Good Luck to the Girl who Loves a Soldier\". This is how she got the nickname \"Britain's best recruiting sergeant\" – young men were sometimes asked to join the army on stage during her show. She also performed in hospitals and sold war bonds. Her husband was knighted in 1919 for his own services to the war effort, and Tilley became Lady de Frece.\n\nOnce the reality of war began to sink home, the recruiting songs all but disappeared – the Greatest Hits collection for 1915 published by top music publisher Francis and Day contains no recruitment songs. After conscription was brought in 1916, songs dealing with the war spoke mostly of the desire to return home. Many also expressed anxiety about the new roles women were taking in society.\n\nPossibly the most notorious of music hall songs from the First World War was \"Oh! It's a lovely war\" (1917), popularised by male impersonator Ella Shields.\n\nMusic hall continued during the interwar period, but no longer as the single dominant form of popular entertainment in Britain. The improvement of cinema, the development of radio, and the cheapening of the gramophone damaged its popularity greatly. It now had to compete with jazz, swing and big band dance music. Licensing restrictions also changed its character.\n\nIn 1914, the London County Council (LCC) enacted that drinking be banished from the auditorium into a separate bar and during 1923 even the separate bar was abolished by parliamentary decree. The exemption of the theatres from this latter act prompted some critics to denounce this legislation as an attempt to deprive the working classes of their pleasures, as a form of social control, whilst sparing the supposedly more responsible upper classes who patronised the theatres (though this could be due to the licensing restrictions brought about due to the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, which also applied to public houses as well). Even so, the music hall gave rise to such major stars as George Formby, Gracie Fields, Max Miller, Will Hay, and Flanagan and Allen during this period.\n\nIn the early 1950s, rock and roll, whose performers initially topped music hall bills, attracted a young audience who had little interest in the music hall acts while driving the older audience away. The final demise was competition from television, which grew very popular after the Queen's coronation was televised. Some music halls tried to retain an audience by putting on striptease acts. In 1957, the playwright John Osborne delivered this elegy:\nMoss Empires, the largest British music hall chain, closed the majority of its theatres in 1960, closely followed by the death of music hall stalwart Max Miller in 1963, prompting one contemporary to write that: \"Music-halls ... died this afternoon when they buried Max Miller\". Miller himself had sometimes said that the genre would die with him. Many music hall performers, unable to find work, fell into poverty; some did not even have a home, having spent their working lives living in digs between performances.\n\nStage and film musicals, however, continued to be influenced by the music hall idiom, including \"Oliver!\", \"Dr Dolittle\" and \"My Fair Lady\". The BBC series \"The Good Old Days\", which ran for thirty years, recreated the music hall for the modern audience, and the \"Paul Daniels Magic Show\" allowed several speciality acts a television presence from 1979 to 1994. Aimed at a younger audience, but still owing a lot to the music hall heritage, was the late '70s series \"The Muppet Show\".\n\nThe music hall was first imported into France in its British form in 1862, but under the French law protecting the state theatres, performers could not wear costumes or recite dialogue, something only allowed in theaters. When the law changed in 1867, the Paris music hall flourished, and a half-dozen new halls opened, offering acrobats, singers, dancers, magicians, and trained animals. The first Paris music call built specially for that purpose was the Folies-Bergere (1869); it was followed by the Moulin Rouge (1889), the Alhambra (1866), the first to be called a music hall, and the Olympia (1893). The \"Printania\" (1903) was a music-garden, open only in summer, with a theater, restaurant, circus, and horse-racing. Older theaters also transformed themselves into music halls, including the Bobino (1873), the Bataclan (1864), and the Alcazar (1858). At the beginning, music halls offered dance reviews, theater and songs, but gradually songs and singers became the main attraction. \nParis music halls all faced stiff competition in the interwar period from the most popular new form of entertainment, the cinema. They responded by offering more complex and lavish shows. In 1911, the Olympia had introduced the giant stairway as a set for its productions, an idea copied by other music halls. The singer Mistinguett made her debut the Casino de Paris in 1895 and continued to appear regularly in the 1920s and 1930s at the Folies Bergère, Moulin Rouge and Eldorado. Her risqué routines captivated Paris, and she became one of the most highly-paid and popular French entertainers of her time.\n\nOne of the most popular entertainers in Paris during the period was the American singer Josephine Baker. Baker sailed to Paris, France. She first arrived in Paris in 1925 to perform in a show called \"\"La Revue Nègre\" at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. She became an immediate success for her erotic dancing, and for appearing practically nude on stage. After a successful tour of Europe, she returned to France to star at the Folies Bergère. Baker performed the 'Danse sauvage,' wearing a costume consisting of a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas.\n\nThe music-halls suffered growing hardships in the 1930s. The Olympia was converted into a movie theater, and others closed. Others continued to thrive. In 1937 and 1930, the Casino de Paris presented shows with Maurice Chevalier, who had already achieved success as an actor and singer in Hollywood.\n\nIn 1935, a twenty-year old singer named Édith Piaf was discovered in the Pigalle by nightclub owner Louis Leplée, whose club, Le Gerny, off the Champs-Élysées, was frequented by the upper and lower classes alike. He persuaded her to sing despite her extreme nervousness. Leplée taught her the basics of stage presence and told her to wear a black dress, which became her trademark apparel. Leplée ran an intense publicity campaign leading up to her opening night, attracting the presence of many celebrities, including Maurice Chevalier. Her nightclub appearance led to her first two records produced that same year, and the beginning of a legendary career.\n\nCompetition from movies and television largely brought an end to the Paris music hall. However, a few still flourish, with tourists as their primary audience. Major music halls include the Folies-Bergere, Crazy Horse Saloon, Casino de Paris, Olympia, and Moulin Rouge. \n\nThe musical forms most associated with music hall evolved in part from traditional folk song and songs written for popular drama, becoming by the 1850s a distinct musical style. Subject matter became more contemporary and humorous, and accompaniment was provided by larger house-orchestras as increasing affluence gave the lower classes more access to commercial entertainment and to a wider range of musical instruments, including the piano. The consequent change in musical taste from traditional to more professional forms of entertainment arose in response to the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation of previously rural populations during the Industrial Revolution. The newly created urban communities, cut off from their cultural roots, required new and readily accessible forms of entertainment.\n\nMusic halls were originally tavern rooms which provided entertainment, in the form of music and speciality acts, for their patrons. By the middle years of the nineteenth century, the first purpose-built music halls were being built in London. The halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs that could no longer be met from the traditional folk song repertoire. Professional songwriters were enlisted to fill the gap.\n\nThe emergence of a distinct music hall style can be credited to a fusion of musical influences. Music hall songs needed to gain and hold the attention of an often jaded and unruly urban audience. In America, from the 1840s, Stephen Foster had reinvigorated folk song with the admixture of Negro spiritual to produce a new type of popular song. Songs like \"Old Folks at Home\" (1851) and \"Oh, Dem Golden Slippers\" (James Bland, 1879) spread round the globe, taking with them the idiom and appurtenances of the minstrel song. Other influences on the rapidly developing music hall idiom were Irish and European music, particularly the jig, polka, and waltz.\n\nTypically, a music hall song consists of a series of verses sung by the performer alone, and a repeated chorus which carries the principal melody, and in which the audience is encouraged to join.\n\nIn Britain, the first music hall songs often promoted the alcoholic wares of the owners of the halls in which they were performed. Songs like \"Glorious Beer\", and the first major music hall success, \"Champagne Charlie\" (1867) had a major influence in establishing the new art form. The tune of \"Champagne Charlie\" became used for the Salvation Army hymn \"Bless His Name, He Sets Me Free\" (1881). When asked why the tune should be used like this, William Booth is said to have replied \"Why should the devil have all the good tunes?\" \"The people the Army sought to save, knew nothing of the hymn tunes or gospel melodies used in the churches, but 'the music hall had been their melody school.\n\nBy the 1870s, the songs were free of their folk music origins, and particular songs also started to become associated with particular singers, often with exclusive contracts with the songwriter, just as many pop songs are today. Towards the end of the style the music became influenced by ragtime and jazz, before being overtaken by them.\n\nMusic hall songs were often composed with their working class audiences in mind. Songs like \"My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)'\", \"Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road\", and \"Waiting at the Church\" expressed in melodic form situations with which the urban poor were very familiar. Music hall songs could be romantic, patriotic, humorous or sentimental, as the need arose. The most popular music hall songs became the basis for the pub songs of the typical Cockney \"knees up\".\n\nAlthough a number of songs show a sharply ironic and knowing view of working class life, there were, too, those which were repetitive, derivative, written quickly and sung to make a living rather than a work of art.\n\n\n\nThe typical music hall comedian was a man or woman, usually dressed in character to suit the subject of the song, or sometimes attired in absurd and eccentric style. Until well into the twentieth century, the acts were essentially vocal, with songs telling a story, accompanied by a minimum of patter. They included a variety of genres, including:\n\n[[File:King, Hetty - 1910 (male impersonator).jpg|thumb|200px|Male impersonator [[Hetty King]]]]\n[[File:Falk, Benjamin J. (1853-1925) - Eugen Sandow (1867-1925).jpg|thumb|200px|Strongman [[Eugen Sandow]]]]\nThe vocal content of the music hall bills, was, from the beginning, accompanied by many other kinds of act, some of them quite weird and wonderful. These were known collectively as \"speciality acts\" (abbreviated to \"spesh\"), which, over time, have included:\n\n\n[[File:1867 NationalStandardTheatre.jpg|thumb|1867 Poster from the National Standard Theatre, [[Shoreditch]] (1837-1940). Not \"strictly\" a Music Hall, but a theatre where many of these artists performed their Music Hall acts.]]\nThe music hall has been evoked in many films, plays, TV series, and books.\n\n[[File:Hackney_Empire%2C_Hackney%2C_E8_%283749526243%29.jpg|thumb|The Hackney Empire, 2009]]\nLondon was the centre of music hall with hundreds of venues, often in the entertainment rooms of public houses. With the decline in popularity of music hall, many were abandoned, or converted to other uses such as cinemas, and their interiors lost. There are a number of purpose-built survivors, including the [[Hackney Empire]], an outstanding example of the late music hall period ([[Frank Matcham]] 1901). This has been restored to its Moorish splendour and now provides an eclectic programme of events from opera to \"Black Variety Nights\". A mile to the south is [[Hoxton Hall]], an 1863 example of the saloon style. It is unrestored but maintained in its original layout, and currently used as a community centre and theatre. In the neighbouring borough, Collins Music Hall (built about 1860) still stands on the north side of [[Islington Green]]. The hall closed in the 1960s and currently forms part of a bookshop.\n\nIn [[Clapham]], [[Grand Theatre, Clapham|The Grand]], originally the Grand Palace of Varieties (1900), has been restored, but its interior reflects its modern use as a music venue and nightclub. The [[Greenwich Theatre]] was originally the Rose and Crown Music Hall (1855), and later became Crowder's Music Hall and Temple of Varieties. The building has been extensively modernised and little of the original layout remains.\n[[File:London-coliseum.jpg|thumb|left|1904 London Coliseum, Matcham theatre with London's widest proscenium arch]]\nIn the nondescript Grace's Alley, off Cable Street, [[Stepney]], stands [[Wilton's Music Hall]]. This 1858 example of the \"giant pub hall\" survived use as a church, fire, flood and war intact, but was virtually derelict, after its use as a rag warehouse, in the 1960s. The Wilton's Music Hall Trust has embarked on a fund-raising campaign to restore the building. In June 2007, the [[World Monuments Fund]] added the building to its list of the world's \"100 most endangered sites\". The music video of the [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] single \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\" was shot here. Many of these buildings can be seen as part of the annual [[London Open House]] event.\n\nThere are also surviving music halls outside London, a notable example being the [[Leeds City Varieties]] (1865) with a preserved interior. This was used for many years as the setting for the BBC television variety show \"[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]\", based on the music-hall genre. The [[Bradford Alhambra|Alhambra Theatre, Bradford]] was built in 1914 for theatre impresario Francis Laidler, and later owned by the [[Oswald Stoll|Stoll]]-[[Edward Moss|Moss]] Empire. It was restored in 1986, and is a fine example of the late [[Edwardian era|Edwardian style]]. It is now a \"receiving theatre\" for touring productions and opera.\n\nIn [[Nottingham]], the [[Malt Cross]] music hall retains its restored cast-iron interior. It is run as a cafe bar by a Christian charitable trust promoting responsible drinking, also as the location of a safe space late at night and for operating a street pastor service. It is an award-winning and popular venue true to its original purpose of providing a venue for up-and-coming musical acts.\n\nIn [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Grand Opera House, Belfast]], Frank Matcham 1895, was preserved and restored in the 1980s. The [[Gaiety Theatre, Isle of Man|Gaiety Theatre]], [[Isle of Man]] is another Matcham design from 1900 that remains in use after an extensive restoration programme in the 1970s. In [[Glasgow]], the [[Britannia Music Hall]] (1857), by architects Thomas Gildard and H.M. McFarlane, remains standing, with much of the theatre intact but in a poor state, having closed in 1938. There is a preservation trust attempting to rescue the theatre.\n\nOne of the few fully functional music hall entertainments is at the Brick Lane Music Hall in a former church in [[North Woolwich]]. The Players' Theatre Club is another group performing a Victorian-style music hall show at a variety of venues, and [[The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America]] stage music hall-style entertainments.\n\nThe term \"music hall\" is used to describe some large musical venues, such as: the [[Paris Olympia]], [[Radio City Music Hall]], [[Friedrichstadt-Palast]] in Berlin and Music Hall in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] (see [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]]).\n\n\n[[Category:Music hall| ]]\n[[Category:British popular music]]\n[[Category:British styles of music]]\n[[Category:Theatre in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Theatrical genres]]"}

The game focuses on tactics and ship management instead of resource collection and base construction.\n\nIn each of the game's missions, the player is given a small number of large space ships (always less than ten, and sometimes just one or two), along with accompanying fighters and bombers. The ships are large and cumbersome, and the battles between fleets protracted, giving the game a noted cinematic feel. Nexus uses the Blacksun Engine, made specifically for the game. Based on DirectX 9, it makes extensive use of vertex and pixel shaders, a parametric particle system, and other visual effects.\n\nThe game is set in the 22nd Century. The player is Marcus Cromwell, a famed spacecraft captain whose father, Richard Cromwell, the first spaceborn human, captained the colony ship \"Noah's Ark\" through a wormhole near Mars that was presumed destroyed when the wormhole collapsed. Cromwell sets out on the SpaceTech heavy corvette, the \"Stiletto\", for Jupiter.\n\nThe events that unfold are \"The Jupiter Incident\", which escalates into an interstellar war. Cromwell engages in battle with several ships and responds to a Kissaki Syndicate (a rival corporation) research base's SOS call. Inside, he finds a cruiser-sized ship of alien origin, named the \"Angelwing\" by the Kissaki. The ship's logs show the corporation has another hidden base close to Pluto, with the base that sent out the SOS call being a distraction for the top-secret research being carried out at the Pluto base.\n\nA normal ship would require almost 4 years to make the trip; however, the \"Angelwing\" can make the trip in several weeks using its special IP Drive. After a battle with the Syndicate fleet for the control of the \"Angelwing\", Cromwell is given command of the cruiser and ordered to investigate the secret base. At Pluto, an artificial intelligence, named Angel, uploads herself into the \"Angelwing\" and commands Cromwell to escape from a strange entity - later known as a Mechanoid - through a nearby wormhole, the same wormhole that collapsed near Mars.\n\nCromwell finds himself in the Noah system populated by the colonists from \"Noah's Ark\", who survived the wormhole collapse and started a colony. The Noah Colony fights as a mercenary race for an advanced but peaceful alien race, called the Vardrags, against another powerful race, the bloodthirsty, reptilian Gorgs, and a local group of renegade Vardrag elites, known as the Raptors.\n\nAfter a successful raid at the Raptor's base, they are then enlisted again to fight against the Gorg Empire. In fights against the Gorg, the Ghosts occasionally seem to help the \"Angelwing\". However, all the races would soon find themselves facing their greatest threat: a virulent race of nanomachines called the Mechanoids. Nothing seems capable of stopping the Mechanoid invasion, and the Vardrag homeworld and Earth are overrun. Only an organic, insectile race, known as the energy-consuming Locusts, are immune to the Mechanoids. With technology adapted from the Locusts, Cromwell is able to rescue Earth and all the other solar systems and shut down the main control system of the Mechanoids, the Entity.\n\nThe fate of Angel, who fought the Mechanoids, is left ambiguous, as she was not shown leaving the Entity and returning to the Angelwing.\n\nVardrags One of the most advanced races in the game. Their main home system is Chakaris (which was eventually evacuated after the attack of the mechanoids on Chakaris III). They are very peaceful and have many strong allies, like the Noah colonists and the Ghosts. Their squadrons are led by the fearful Raptors. Though they do not know much of war tactics, they could gather very useful information on the enemy and could subsequently defeat them. Catacalysm missile is one of the deadliest creations of this alien group.\n\nGorgs Terrific and bloodthirsty and enemies of Vardrags and their allies. Though most of the clans of the Gorgs are brave, some, like the Raghara clan, execute many cowardly attacks. They do not even fear the Black Moon. The siege laser is one of the deadliest weapons of this alien group. Notable ships are \"Titan\" base and \"Warcry\" (Gorg Emperor's ship).\n\nGhosts Terribly intelligent creatures. Their home system is Mist and generally perform stealth missions for the Vardrags. Their ships have a special ability of camouflage.\n\nLocust Insect like creatures. Like ants or honey bees, their community is divided into warriors, workers and queen. The Energy Skeeter is their most powerful weapon.\n\nRaptors They are actually the fearsome allies of Vardrags, but some turn rogue against their masters and revolt against them. They are subsequently massacred by the Noah colonists.\n\n\"Nexus: The Jupiter Incident\" was developed by the Hungarian-based Mithis Entertainment, intended by the publisher CDV originally as \"Imperium Galactica 3\". After the business relationship between Mithis and CDV broke apart and also the Imperium Galactica license got lost, the game was revised together with Most Wanted Entertainment as tactical strategy game.\n\nThe game was finally released in Europe in 2004 and in North America in 2005 for Windows.\n\nA technical demonstration video for the sequel, \"Nexus: The Jupiter Incident 2\", was \"leaked\" to the Internet in 2006.\n\nOn August 16, 2011 Most Wanted Entertainment announced a sequel, named \"Nexus 2\", on the crowdfunding website \"GamesPlant\" with a funding goal of €400,000. The €104,867 pledged fell short of the €400,000 goal.\n\nIn 2012 the original Nexus was digitally re-released on GOG.com.\n\nOn September 28, 2012 a second campaign on Kickstarter was launched to fund the development of a sequel named \"Nexus 2: The Gods Awaken\", but ultimately failed to raise the required amount, with only $161,731 of the $650,000 goal.\n\nNordic Games announced that they acquired the intellectual property on September 16, 2015.\n\nIn March 2016 a patch was released for the game fixing long standing issues, like widescreen support.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was praised particularly for its visual effects, but criticized for its steep learning curve, trial and error gameplay, and poorly designed stealth missions.\n\nAccording to NPD Group, \"Nexus\" sold 11,500 copies by June 2005.\n\n"}

The film is a prequel to the 1992 film, \"With or Without You\", and was produced in response to the popularity of Cheung's character, \"Prince\".\n\nTriad leaders White Tiger (Chan Yuen) and Green Dragon (Michael Chan) become enemies while fighting for the objection of Yuk-fung (Yip San). Tiger abducts the child Prince and fabricates a story of how his mother was abducted by Dragon. Since then, prince was determined to study martial arts in order to kill Dragon and rescue his mother. Prince was trained by Tiger to be a killer, and killing Dragon have become Prince's goal. One day, when Prince (Jacky Cheung) had the chance to kill Dragon, he sees his dream lover, Tweedy (Rosamund Kwan), and as a result, fails to kill Dragon, breaking his reputation of never making mistakes on missions. Prince's assistant, Ching-ching (Carina Lau), whom is deeply in love with him, arranges Tweedy to seemingly disappear for a while for the sake of him. However, Prince mistakenly believes that Ching-ching betrayed him and killed Tweedy and begins to drink heavily. Because he thinks Tweedy is dead, Prince feels hopeless. Later, Tiger calls Dragon out to meet with him, telling him that Prince is actually Dragon's son, a fact that Prince did not expect. When Tiger and Dragon were arguing who is truly Prince's father, Tiger points his gun at Prince and blames Prince for his resentments. During a battle, Ching-ching gets shot and killed by Tiger in order to protect Prince. Afterwards, Prince sadly carries Ching-ching away, reminiscing a time when Ching-ching asked him whether he will cry when she dies. Later, Tweedy also tells Prince that Ching-ching entrusted her to not meet with him until he kills Dragon. Prince did not say a word, and silently watches the distant sunset with Tweedy.\n\n\n\"LoveHKFilm\" gave the film a mixed review citing cheesy production values and \"nothing really makes sense\", but also noting how \"the production design and cinematography are overblown to entertaining distraction, and the stars are welcome ones nowadays.\"\n\nThe film grossed HK$6,917,896 at the Hong Kong box office during its theatrical run from 16 to 29 April 1993.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "336025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336025", "title": "P. D. Q. Bach", "text": "P. D. Q. Bach\n\nP.D.Q.Bach is a fictitious composer invented by musical satirist \"Professor\" Peter Schickele. Schickele developed a five-decade-long career, performing the \"discovered\" works of the \"only forgotten son\" of the Bach family. Schickele's music combines parodies of musicological scholarship, the conventions of Baroque and classical music, and slapstick. The name \"P.D.Q.\" is a parody of the three-part names given to some members of the Bach family that are commonly reduced to initials, such as C.P.E., for Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. \"PDQ\" is an initialism for \"pretty damned quick\".\n\nSchickele began working on the character while studying at the Aspen Music Festival and School and at Juilliard, and has performed a variety of P. D. Q. Bach shows over the years. \"The Village Voice\" mentions the juxtaposition of collage, bitonality, musical satire, and orchestral surrealism in a \"bizarre melodic stream of consciousness\". \"In P.D.Q. Bach he has single-handedly mapped a musical universe that everyone knew was there and no one else had the guts (not simply the bad taste) to explore.\" As of 2012 he has decreased touring due to age. He performed two concerts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his first concert at The Town Hall in New York on December 28 and 29, 2015, and continues to give live concert performances.\n\nSchickele gives a humorous fictional biography of the composer according to which P. D. Q. Bach was born in Leipzig on April 1, 1742, the son of Johann Sebastian Bach and Anna Magdalena Bach; the twenty-first of Johann's twenty children. He is also referred to as \"the youngest and oddest of Johann Sebastian’s 20-odd children.\" He died May 5, 1807, though his birth and death years are often listed on album literature in reverse, as \"(1807–1742)?\". According to Schickele, P. D. Q. \"possessed the originality of Johann Christian, the arrogance of Carl Philipp Emanuel, and the obscurity of Johann Christoph Friedrich.\"\n\nSchickele's works attributed to P. D. Q. Bach often incorporate comical rearrangements of well-known works of other composers. The works use instruments not normally used in orchestras, such as the bagpipes, slide whistle, kazoo, and fictional or experimental instruments such as the pastaphone (made of uncooked manicotti), tromboon, hardart, lasso d'amore, and left-handed sewer flute.\nThere is often a startling juxtaposition of styles within a single P. D. Q. Bach piece. The \"Prelude to Einstein on the Fritz\", which alludes to Philip Glass' opera \"Einstein on the Beach\", provides an example. The underlying music is J.S. Bach's first prelude from \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\", but at double the normal speed, with each phrase repeated interminably in a minimalist manner that parodies Glass's. On top of this mind-numbing structure is added everything from jazz phrases to snoring to heavily harmonized versions of \"Three Blind Mice\" to the chanting of a meaningless phrase (\"Koy Hotsy-Totsy,\" alluding to the art film \"Koyaanisqatsi\" for which Glass wrote the score). Through all these mutilations, the piece never deviates from Bach's original harmonic structure.\n\nThe humor in P. D. Q. Bach music often derives from violation of audience expectations, such as repeating a tune more than the usual number of times, resolving a musical chord later than usual or not at all, unusual key changes, excessive dissonance, or sudden switches from high art to low art. Further humor is obtained by replacing parts of certain classical pieces with similar common songs, such as the opening of Brahms' Symphony No. 2 with \"Beautiful Dreamer\", or rewriting Tchaikovsky's \"1812 Overture\" as the \"1712 Overture\", with \"Yankee Doodle\" replacing Tchaikovsky's melody, and \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" replacing \"La Marseillaise\".\n\nSchickele divides P. D. Q. Bach's fictional musical output into three periods: the Initial Plunge, the Soused Period, and Contrition. During the Initial Plunge, P. D. Q. Bach wrote the \"Traumerei\" for solo piano, an \"Echo Sonata\" for \"two unfriendly groups of instruments\", and a \"Gross Concerto for Divers Flutes, two Trumpets, and Strings\". During the Soused (or Brown-Bag) Period, P. D. Q. Bach wrote a \"Concerto for Horn & Hardart\", a \"Sinfonia Concertante\", a \"Pervertimento for Bicycle, Bagpipes, and Balloons\", a \"Serenude\", a \"Perückenstück\" (literally German for \"Hairpiece\"), a Suite from \"The Civilian Barber\" (spoofing Rossini's \"The Barber of Seville\"), a \"Schleptet\" in E-flat major, the half-act opera \"The Stoned Guest\" (the character of \"The Stone Guest\" from Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\"), a \"Concerto for Piano vs. Orchestra\", \"Erotica Variations\" (Beethoven's \"Eroica Variations\"), \"Hansel and Gretel and Ted and Alice\", an opera in one unnatural act (Humperdinck's \"Hansel and Gretel\" and the 1969 film \"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice\"), \"The Art of the Ground Round\" (Bach's \"The Art of Fugue\"), a \"Concerto for Bassoon vs. Orchestra\", and a \"Grand Serenade for an Awful Lot of Winds and Percussion\".\n\nDuring the Contrition Period, P. D. Q. Bach wrote the cantata \"Iphigenia in Brooklyn\" (Gluck's \"Iphigenia in Aulis\", etc.), the oratorio \"The Seasonings\" (Haydn's \"The Seasons\"), \"Diverse Ayres on Sundrie Notions\", a \"Sonata for Viola Four Hands\", the chorale prelude \"Should\", a \"Notebook for Betty Sue Bach\" (Bach's \"Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach\" and Buddy Holly's \"Peggy Sue\"), the \"Toot Suite\", the \"Grossest Fugue\" (Beethoven's \"Grosse Fuge\"), a \"Fanfare for the Common Cold\" (Copland's \"Fanfare for the Common Man\") and the canine cantata \"Wachet Arf!\" (Bach's \"Wachet auf\").\n\nA final work is the mock religious work \"Missa Hilarious\" (Beethoven's \"Missa Solemnis\") (Schickele no. NO – the chemical formula of nitrous oxide or \"laughing gas\").\n\nThe tromboon is a musical instrument made up of the reed and bocal of a bassoon, attached to the body of a trombone in place of the trombone's mouthpiece. It combines the sound of double reeds and the slide for a distinctive and unusual instrument. The name of the instrument is a portmanteau of \"trombone\" and \"bassoon\". The sound quality of the instrument is best described as comical and loud.\n\nThe tromboon was developed by Peter Schickele, a skilled bassoonist himself, and featured in some of his live concert and recorded performances. Schickele called it \"a hybrid – that's the nicer word – constructed from the parts of a bassoon and a trombone; it has all the disadvantages of both\". This instrument is called for in the scores of P. D. Q. Bach's oratorio \"The Seasonings\", as well as the \"Serenude (for devious instruments)\" and \"Shepherd on the Rocks, With a Twist\".\n\nFour of the Telarc P. D. Q. Bach recordings received Grammy awards in the Best Comedy Recording category. These were the four albums released from 1989 until 1992. Schickele also received a Grammy nomination in the Best Comedy Album category in 1996 for his abridged audiobook edition of \"The Definitive Biography of P. D. Q. Bach\".\n\n\n\n"}

After music studies at Oxford, he was a post-graduate student at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, where he studied piano with Ryszard Bakst.\n\nAlthough he has released several recordings, including discs of Carl Nielsen, Victor Bendix, and Louis Glass, he is perhaps most known for his current endeavour to record all 90 of the keyboard sonatas of Baldassare Galuppi for The Divine Art record company. This has involved him in personally researching manuscripts of Galuppi's sonatas in Venice, and reportedly in editing and publishing them in due course as well.\n\nReviews of Seivewright's Galuppi have been varied. Some have been impressed by Galuppi's sonatas themselves, using Domenico Scarlatti as a benchmark with one reviewer calling them \"far more appealing than Scarlatti sonatas,\"; others have made the same comparison to Galuppi's detriment (\"the individual pieces lack the character and sparkling invention so typical of Scarlatti\"). \n\nSeivewright's playing has also been evaluated variously, with many reviewers applauding it. Reviewer Gerald Fenech terms him \"an enthusiastic and technically accomplished pianist\" who \"plays with great conviction and flair in all the sonatas presented here.\" Kevin Sutton, however, complains that \"The halting playing, lack of line tension and the image that I was listening to a pianist playing over, rather than through a composer continually disturbed me. (Glenn Gould would have been proud.)\"\n\nSeivewright has also been a champion of music by living composers, having performed Rory Boyle's piano concerto and \"Moduli\" (a series of piano pieces), and commissioning \"A Saltire Sonata\" from Robert Crawford. He also performed Martin Dalby's score for the ten-minute film for schoolchildren \"Let's See: Winter.\"\n\nAccording to Britain's \"The Daily Telegraph,\" Seivewright underwent a quadruple-bypass operation in 2000, and used a work by Johann Sebastian Bach for purposes of music therapy.

The minimum age for prostitutes is 14 years old. It was estimated in 2015 that were around 15,000 prostitutes in the country.\n\nProstitution is common in Managua. Prostitutes work on the streets, in nightclubs and bars, or in massage parlors.\n\nProstitutes are known locally as \"zorras\".\n\nFrom 1880 to 1927 there were no prostitution laws. Prostitutes, pimps and madams were charged with vagrancy. Prostitution was legalised and regulated from April 1927. Prostitutes has to register and have a weekly health check. Those who did not comply were fined by the police, or after 1933 the National Guard.\n\nIn August 1955 a law was passed prohibiting the promotion of prostitution. By then the national Guard had taken control of prostitution in the country. The only people jailed for controlling prostitution were those who wouldn't pay the required bribes.\n\nStarting in the 1960s President Somoza's business empire moved into prostitution and gambling houses. The National Guard (who Somoza was the head of), through being bribed, ensured these establishments flourished. After Somoza was deposed in 1979 by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN)), one of their first actions was the destruction and burning of \"a great number of brothels, bars and gambling houses\". The FSLN had previously advocated the elimination of prostitution in its 1969 manifesto, but this was never enacted.\n\nNicaragua became the first country to train sex workers to be official representatives of the government and the judicial system. In a pilot scheme, 16 sex workers were trained as \"Facilitadoras judiciales\" (judicial facilitators). This led to a further 60 sex workers being trained. The eventual aim is to have at least six sex workers trained in every municipality (153).\n\nThe scheme was organised by the Sunflowers \"Sex Workers’ Association\" and is part of a larger initiative that has trained 4,300 facilitators in the country. The scheme is endorsed by the Nicaraguan Judicial System. Vice-president Marvin Aguilar said \"We are the only country in the world that treats sex workers as ‘judicial facilitators’. The only country in the world that does not try and arrest them, where the activity is not criminalized.”\n\nThe judicial facilitators have the following tasks:\n\nWith only 0.2 percent of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive, Nicaragua has one of the lowest HIV prevalence rates in Central America. HIV was first detected in Nicaragua in 1987, after concentrated epidemics had been reported in other Central American nations. The onset of the epidemic was likely delayed by Nicaragua’s 10-year civil war and the U.S.-led economic blockade, both of which left the country isolated for several years. Relative control over commercial sex work, low infection rates among injecting drug users, and a ban on the commercial sale of blood also slowed HIV transmission.\n\nA September 2005 study on HIV among commercial sex workers reported by UNAIDS demonstrated a prevalence of only 0.2 percent in that group. This had increased to 2.6% in 2016.\n\nChild prostitution is widespread, particularly in Managua, port cities, along the Honduran and Costa Rican borders, and near highways. \n\nThe law permits juveniles 14 years of age or older to engage in prostitution. According to Casa Alianza, between 1,200 and 1,500 girls and young women work in the brothels of Managua, and almost half are under the age of 18. Every night, hundreds of teenage girls line the Masaya Highway commercial corridor on the capital's south side. Street children engage in prostitution, often to support a drug habit.\n\nNicaragua is a destination for child sex tourists from the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. The law imposes a penalty of five to seven years' imprisonment for convicted sex tourism offenders.\n\nNicaragua is principally a source and transit country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Nicaraguan women and children are subjected to sex trafficking within the country and in other Central American countries, Mexico, and the United States. Many trafficking victims are recruited in rural areas or border regions with false promises of high-paying jobs in urban centres and tourist locales, where they are subjected to sex trafficking. Victims’ family members are often complicit in their exploitation, and traffickers have reportedly increased recruitment activity on social media sites. Nicaraguan women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in the RAAN and RAAS, where the lack of strong law enforcement institutions and a higher crime rate increase the vulnerability of the local population. \n\nNicaraguans from Northern-Central departments who migrate to other Central American countries and Europe are reportedly vulnerable to sextrafficking. During the reporting period, Nicaraguans were reported as among the primary nationalities of victims identified in Guatemala. In addition, children left by these migrants in Nicaragua reportedly become vulnerable to sex trafficking. \n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Nicaragua as a Tier 2 Watch List country.\n\n"}

It was popularized by the magician Si Stebbins, and can be constructed from a standard 52-card deck. Frequently used in card magic, its properties allow the position and value of each card in a deck to be determined.\n\nEach card in a Si Stebbins stack alternates suit in the CHaSeD order (Clubs Hearts Spades Diamonds), and has a numerical value three greater than the preceding card. The Aces are given the numerical value of 1 and the Jack, Queen, and King of each suit are given the values 11, 12, and 13 respectively.\n\nFor instance, in a deck in Si Stebbins order, is followed by the , , , and .\n\nThe deck stack is considered cyclic as any card in the deck can be used to determine the value and position of any other card in the deck. The bottom card of the deck is in order with the top card of the deck making the order of cards an endlessly repeating cycle.

Then, by looking at the bottom card, the spectators selection can be revealed.\n\nFor instance, if the card on the bottom is the , the performer will add three to the numeric value making 12 (or Queen) and move to the next suit in the order (Clubs). The selected card is the .\n\nMathematical card stacks in which each card's value progresses by 3, 4, or 5 are detailed in magic literature as early as the 16th Century.\n\nThe system was originally published in the United States in Boston or New York City around 1898 by Si Stebbins (real name William Coffrin), in a pamphlet titled \"Si Stebbins' Card Tricks And The Way He Performs Them\" and a later edition \"Card Tricks And The Way They Are Performed\".\n\nDespite contrary claims, Stebbins maintained that the stack was his invention:\nHoward Thurston claimed to have invented the system in his 1903 book \"Howard Thurstons Card Tricks\" referring to it as \"The 'Thurston' System of Expert Card Manipulation.\" and thanking Stebbins \"...for many valuable \nsuggestions and ideas with regard to its conception.\" \n\nThe card stack is generally known as Si Stebbins today, and is referred to as such in many card magic books including \"The Encyclopedia of Card Tricks\" and \"Expert Card Technique\".\n\n"}

Some reaserchers claim that the style was originally used to recite hymns by members of the Zoroastrian faith, and later, members of Islamic Sufi faiths. Originally, Siyaw Chemane is performed without the use of any instruments, with the exception of the occasional use of a Kurdish hand-drum. Today, the Siyaw Chemane style is used mostly for storytelling and entertainment. Some modern Kurdish artists have adopted the style and added instruments to record songs that blend Siyaw Chemane with other Kurdish music.\n\nSiyaw Chemane is performed in the Hawrami dialect of Gorani. However, some modern artists have adopted the style for use with Sorani, which is more commonly spoken by ethnic Kurds.\n\n\"Siyaw Chemane\" literally means dark eyes in Hawrami. In the Kurdish culture, big dark and black-colored eyes are regarded as a trait of beauty particularly for women. Kurdish love songs often talk about dark eyes. The \"Siyaw Chemane\" style of singing is often an expression of love - whether love for God or love for another person - and may be the reason for its association with dark eyes.\n\nThere are some similar methods of singing in Kurdish music, specially in Music of south of Kurdistan, Kermanshah (Kermashan) Province, Ilam Province and Lak inhabitant regions of Luristan Province in Iranian Kurdistan and Diyala Province in Iraqi Kurdistan. Siyaw Chamane is so close and similar to Houreh singing, and also Mour singing, and Benmelli singing which are belong to those regions of south of Kurdistan.\n"}

{"id": "21075791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21075791", "title": "The Call of the Wild (2007 film)", "text": "The Call of the Wild (2007 film)\n\nThe Call of the Wild is a 2007 documentary film by the independent filmmaker Ron Lamothe. The premise details the odyssey of Christopher McCandless as Lamothe takes a road trip across North America to the places McCandless visited. Within the film, Lamothe reaches conclusions about McCandless' death which contradict both Sean Penn's film \"Into the Wild\" (2007) and Jon Krakauer's book \"Into the Wild\" (1997), on which Penn's film was based.\n\nIn 2006, Ron Lamothe, decided to make a road trip documentary on Christopher McCandless. Lamothe was inspired by McCandless' story even before the book \"Into the Wild\" (1997) was published, as both he and McCandless were born in 1968 and graduated from college in 1990. They also shared the same roommate at one time in their lives, and Lamothe took a life-changing trip to Africa during the same time as McCandless' travels. \n\nAfter a brief swim in Walden Pond, Lamothe begins his journey to Annandale, Virginia, where McCandless grew up and went to high school. Lamothe then journeys to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where McCandless graduated in May 1990, and attends the 2006 graduation ceremony. Also attending the ceremony is filmmaker Sean Penn, who coincidentally was then filming a major motion picture about McCandless. Lamothe interviews a few graduates on their plans after college in hopes of finding a \"McCandless\" in the crowd while comparing the graduates to the free-spirited Generation X.\n\nLamothe then ventures to California and visits Slab City, where McCandless had stayed during the Christmas holidays in 1991. Lamothe tours Salvation Mountain and interviews Leonard Knight, who built the site and claims to have met McCandless during McCandless' stay. \n\nOn June 3, Lamothe and a friend travel to Lake Mead and discuss the casting choice of Emile Hirsch as McCandless in the upcoming film. They incidentally pass through Penn's production as he sees two yellow Datsun B-210 props, the same car McCandless drove and later lost during a flash flood. Lamothe has the entire Lake Mead to himself without being bothered by Penn's crew, who chose to film in a different location.\n\nLamothe then decides to visit Carthage, South Dakota, where McCandless took on a job working at a grain elevator in September 1990 and in April 1992. Like McCandless, Lamothe travels to Carthage solely by hitchhiking. Lamothe travels through Colorado with an ex-drug dealer—who used to live in Alaska-and along I-80 through Nebraska to Council Bluffs, Iowa with a group of young adults who enjoy collecting mushrooms alongside the road. After days of hitchhiking, Lamothe finally makes it to Carthage but learns that no one in the town will take interviews for his documentary, since they are under contract by Paramount Vantage for Penn's film. However, Lamothe does get to interview the truck driver who gave McCandless a ride from Carthage to Enderlin, North Dakota, as his life story was not owned by Paramount.\n\nAfter departing Carthage, Lamothe travels through Canada but this time as the driver. He agrees to pick up any hitchhiker he sees but unfortunately doesn't find any along the way. \n\nFinally, Lamothe arrives in Fairbanks, Alaska, where he interviews a few locals at a bar who only have criticisms about McCandless. Lamothe sets out on the Stampede Trail on foot, but when he tries to cross the Teklanika River, his camera becomes damaged, leading him to think his film is ruined. However, unknown to Lamothe, his camera is fine as he attempts to film as much of Bus 142 (where McCandless died in August 1992) as possible. After a few nights at the bus, Lamothe travels back home to Massachusetts and returns to his normal life.\n\nLamothe documents several later findings that contradict Krakauer's book and Penn's film. He reports that McCandless was not poisoned by wild potato seeds as Krakauer had suspected, and that such poisoning had been disproved by toxicology reports. However, later findings reported by Krakauer and Anchorage reporter Craig Medred may supersede those earlier reports. Penn's film depicted McCandless being poisoned by wild foods he mistakenly had eaten.\n\nLamothe also reveals that McCandless did not destroy his driver's license nor social security card, nor did he burn all his cash as depicted in the book and film. In a hidden pocket on McCandless' backpack was found his wallet with all forms of ID and US$300 in cash.\n\nLamothe further suspects that McCandless had an arm or shoulder injury not shown in the famous self-portrait photo by the bus, in which McCandless' shirt sleeve has the appearance of being empty. Lamothe believes, based on McCandless' S.O.S. note, that McCandless had injured his arm or dislocated his shoulder, and thus could not have swum across the Teklanika River to escape.\n\nThe film screened October 8 and 9, 2007 as part of the San Francisco Documentary Film Festival, and the University of Alaska hosted the Fairbanks premiere of the film December 10, 2007.\n\nThe Denver Film Society offered that the film mounted \"a thoughtful challenge to Jon Krakauer's \"Into the Wild\" (and actor-director Sean Penn's screen adaptation thereof), \"The Call of the Wild\" presents an alternative to the popular account of Chris McCandless, the self-styled 'aesthetic voyager' who died alone in the Alaskan wilderness in 1992 at age 24.\" They further noted Lamothe's, while filming, having several \"run-ins\" with Penn who was, in the same time-frame and locations, himself involved in the making of a production about McCandless, and made note of how Penn's production had \"the clout to thwart Lamothe at many a turn.\" They concluded: \"ultimately, however, what lies at the film's core is Lamothe's own journey of discovery. The conceit allows him to explore the concept of wilderness and its influence on the American psyche, as well as its reflection on our cultural landscape; the generation gap as measured by changing rites of passage; and the disparity between independent and Hollywood filmmaking.\"\n\nBritish film critic Neil Young wrote that the film was a \"disarmingly fresh, utterly engrossing documentary\" in how it addressed \"specific details of McCandless's controversial life (and even more controversial demise)\" by director Ron Lamothe covering \"a surprisingly expansive amount of geographic and thematic terrain as he journeys cross-county – driving, then hitchhiking – in McCandless's footsteps.\" In watching the production, Young offered \"the film becomes not so much about McCandless or Lamothe (though it's certainly to some degree a portrait of both) but a more general rumination on the ambitions and limitations of the generation to which both belonged (the picture is part-dedicated to 'Generation X') and also a celebration of rural America's more eccentric backwaters.\"\n\n\"Suite101\" compares the different media depicting McCandless' journey and death. They note Sean Penn's version makes McCandless into a societal hero who burns his identity and money in a personal quest to exile himself from the material demands and obligations of modern society. The feel that although slightly different, the depictions by Krakauer and Lamothe were more down-to-Earth, and note that while Krakauer's version has McCandless divest himself of all identification, Lamothe's version attempted to be more accurate in its revealing that McCandless' wallet was discovered inside the wreckage of the bus, and that it contained his social security card, birth certificate, driver's licence, health card, map, and even library card, as well as $300 cash.\n\n\"Juneau Empire\" wrote that release of the Krakauer book and the Penn and Lamothe films \"cemented the mystique of Christopher McCandless\" and there has been an increase of visitors coming to Alaska to retrace his steps. They also reported that 25 miles east of the site of the wrecked bus, residents of the Healy, Alaska, feared the influx of unprepared visitors \"making dangerous pilgrimages for a character portrayed as a spiritual visionary rather than an ill-prepared misfit, as many Alaskans view McCandless.\" While the wrecked 1940s-era International Harvester bus had been used for decades as a shelter by hunters, hikers, and other backwoods travelers, there is an area-wide worry about the safety of unprepared visitors \"who are determined to make it to the bus no matter what.\" \n\n\"SFist\" wrote that while the film's first half appears to be more about Ron Lamothe and less about Christopher McCandless, the \"documentary gets good at the end and there are some interesting theories and revelations (the popular theory that McCandless died from poison seeds/berries is refuted)\", and the film could have used better editing. They also felt that the amount of time Lamothe spent documenting the people who picked him up while he hitchhiked in a manner emulating McCandless', was \"a use of screen time that seems beyond self-indulgent.\"\n\n\"Kentucky Educational Television\" made note that, through the following of Christopher McCandless' footsteps, Ron Lamothe's film \"uncovers never-before-seen evidence that sheds new light on the case, and the mystery surrounding his death\", directly contradicting Jon Krakauer's interpretations in the book \"Into the Wild\" and those made in Sean Penn's film adaption of Krakauer's book.\n\n"}

The World of Pet Supplies takes place with the Hong Kong Houseware Fair at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC). The number of exhibitors in the 2010 event increased to 106.\n\nThe World of Pet Supplies fair is held every year between the 20 and 23 April. The event in 2011 was the 26th fair, with more visitors and exhibitors expected than in the previous year, given the popularity that this event has gained. The largest fair of this type is held in Hong Kong, in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Here, pet owners can get anything for their pets from dog wheels to accessories, grooming supplies, cages, aquarium supplies and everything is needed in a house which accommodates pets.\n\nAlthough the fair officially starts on the 20th of April, the afternoon of the day prior to the opening is reserved for the registration of the buyers. Everyone who wants to attend this fair must be registered and in most cases a pre-registration is required. The latter can be done via the official website of the fair. The three main days of the fair are the 20th, 21st and 22nd. The fair is then open from 9am to 6:30pm, and the buyers may register in the same days with 30 minutes before the fair starts or ends. The last day of the World of Pet Supplies fair is shorter and the event takes place only from 9am to 5pm.\n\nThe World of Pet Supplies is sponsored by different political bodies such as the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, The Hong Kong Exporters' Association, The Indian Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong and the Trade and Industry Department along with the HKSAR Government. The organizers of this event, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council is a statutory body that has been functioning since 1966. The HKTDC has the mission to promote trade within Hong Kong by encouraging the financial activity of the small and medium-sized enterprises. The aim of the corporation is to support the manufacturers, traders and service providers whose businesses are based in Hong Kong. Of its 40 international offices, 11 are situated on Chinese mainland. By organizing this type of trade event, the HKTDC is aiming to promote Hong Kong as a platform for doing business with China and throughout Asia.\n\nAccording to the Society for the Voluntary Control of Fair and Exhibition Statistics (FKM) more than 2,000 exhibitors have been present at this fair and the event managed to attract over 25,000 visitors and potential buyers. According to FKM, the majority of visitors came from Asia (approximately 52%) and Europe (18%) followed by America (13%). As expected, most of the exhibitors present at the fair up until now have been from Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland (1,356 out of a total of 2,149).\n\nIn order to be eligible for admission, visitors must be older than 18. Exhibitors on the other hand must comply with more complex criteria. Firstly, exhibitors that wish to participate at this fair must be legally registered companies/businesses carrying on business either in Hong Kong or in their country of origin in accordance with applicable laws. In order to prove so, exhibitors are likely to be asked for their latest registration certificate or other documents that can provide proof of a bona fide business. There is also a fee that must be paid by every exhibitor and which depends on the type of booth the exhibitor wants to use. The smallest fee is of $4,680 for a standard booth of 9 m2. Exhibitors who need wide spaces to display their products may get a raw space of at least 27 m2, for $455/m2.\n\nWorld of Pet Supplies is the special highlight of the HKTDC Hong Kong Houseware Fair and is held at the same time as the HKTDC Hong Kong International Home Textiles Fair. The zones of the fair are themed and there is a Hall of Elegance with products intended for designer collections and brand names, ASEAN which is a group of pavilions from countries belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and World of Fine Dining which includes bar accessories, kitchenware and tableware of high quality. The World of Pet Supplies is the fair designed for selling and buying products that are pet related.\n\nThe World of Pet Supplies fair was created in response to strong market demand, and features items from basic to luxurious in the categories of pet-related products and services, aquatic products and veterinary products.

It is described as a combination of traditional African music with psychedelic rock and funk. \n\nIt has been described as the combined sound of Jimi Hendrix and James Brown. Many Zamrock bands were also influenced by the heavy repetitive riffs of bands like Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, the Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, and Cream. \n\nRikki Ililonga and his band Musi-O-Tunya are generally credited as the creators of this genre. Other notable artists include WITCH, The Peace, Amanaz, Chrissy \"Zebby\" Tembo, and Paul Ngozi and his Ngozi Family.\n\nZamrock's roots can be traced back to the 1950s, with northern singers from the Copperbelt Province such as Stephen Tsotsi Kasumali, William Mapulanga, and John Lushi.\n\nZamrock as a musical movement came of age in the turbulent first decade after Zambia's independence from British colonialism, rising and falling in tandem with the country's economic success. Zambia's boom from its copper mines led to a bust when copper prices fell and the country was devastated by the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s.\n\nAfter the country announced its independence in 1964, then-president Kenneth Kaunda decreed that 95% of music played on radio stations had to be Zambian in origin. The rush to urbanization in mine-adjacent regions meant a variety of new artistic styles. The country's newfound wealth brought with it urban sensibilities and a surge in interest in electric guitar use. Zamrock player Paul Ngozi of the Ngozi Family is credited with creating the kalindula sound, a rhythmic pop music sound with fuzzy electric guitar leads centred around the bass guitar of the same name.\n\nWhile the price of copper fell and Zambia's economy crashed, Zambia found itself surrounded by political turmoil in neighbouring states. When the country offered to shelter refugees, Zambia's power stations were bombed. Once-prosperous cities were at the mercy of blackouts and curfews. Musicians were reduced to playing unstable sets during daylight hours while their ticket prices became unaffordable for most. Every member of WITCH except Emanuel “Jagari” Chanda died of AIDS by 2001.\n\nA resurgence of interest across the globe in recent years, including reissues in North America and the production of a documentary, has allowed some Zamrock performers, including Jagari, to tour, perform, and record new material.\n"}
