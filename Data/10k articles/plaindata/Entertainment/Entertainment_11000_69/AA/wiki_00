{"id": "142421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142421", "title": "Babe (film)", "text": "Babe (film)\n\nBabe is a 1995 Australian-American comedy-drama film directed by Chris Noonan, produced by George Miller, and written by both. It is an adaptation of Dick King-Smith's 1983 novel \"The Sheep-Pig\", also known as \"Babe: The Gallant Pig\" in the US, which tells the story of a pig raised as livestock who wants to do the work of a sheepdog. The main animal characters are played by a combination of real and animatronic pigs and Border Collies.\n\nAfter seven years of development, \"Babe\" was filmed in Robertson, New South Wales, Australia. The talking-animal visual effects were done by Rhythm & Hues Studios and Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The film was both a box office and critical success, and in 1998 Miller went on to direct a sequel, \"\".\n\nBabe, an orphaned piglet, is chosen for a \"guess the weight\" contest at a county fair. The winning farmer, Arthur Hoggett, brings him home and allows him to stay with a Border Collie named Fly, her mate Rex and their puppies, in the barn.\n\nA duck named Ferdinand, who crows as roosters are said to every morning to wake people so he will be considered useful and be spared from being eaten, persuades Babe to help him destroy the alarm clock that threatens his mission. Despite succeeding in this, they wake Duchess, the Hoggetts' cat, and in the confusion accidentally destroy the living room. Rex sternly instructs Babe to stay away from Ferdinand (now a fugitive) and the house. Sometime later, when Fly's puppies are put up for sale, Babe asks if he can call her \"Mom\".\n\nChristmas brings a visit from the Hoggetts' relatives. Babe is almost chosen for Christmas dinner but a duck is picked instead after Hoggett remarks to his wife Esme that Babe may bring a prize for ham at the next county fair. On Christmas Day, Babe justifies his existence by alerting Hoggett to sheep rustlers stealing sheep from one of the fields. The next day, Hoggett sees Babe sort the hens, separating the brown from the white ones. Impressed, he takes him to the fields and allows him to try and herd the sheep. Encouraged by an elder ewe named Maa, the sheep cooperate, but Rex sees Babe's actions as an insult to sheepdogs and confronts Fly in a vicious fight for encouraging Babe. He injures her leg and accidentally bites Hoggett's hand when he tries to intervene. Rex is then chained to the dog house, muzzled and sedated, leaving the sheep herding job to Babe.\n\nOne morning, Babe is awakened by the sheep's cries and finds three dogs attacking them. Although he manages to scare them off, Maa is mortally injured and dies as a result. Hoggett arrives and, thinking that Babe killed her, prepares to shoot him. Fly is so anxious to find out whether he is guilty or innocent that, instead of barking orders at the sheep, she talks to them to find out what happened. Learning the truth, she barks to distract Hoggett, delaying him until Esme mentions that the police say feral dogs have been killing sheep on neighboring farms and asks him why he has taken his shotgun out.\n\nWhen Esme leaves on a trip, Hoggett signs Babe up for a local sheepherding competition. As it is raining the night before, Hoggett lets him and Fly into the house. However, Duchess scratches him when he tries to speak to her, so Hoggett immediately confines her outside. When she is let back in later, she gets revenge on Babe by revealing that humans eat pigs. Horrified, he runs out to the barn and learns from Fly that this is true. The next morning, Fly discovers that Babe has run away. She and Rex alert Hoggett and they all search for him. Rex finds him in a cemetery and Hoggett brings him home. However, he is still demoralized and refuses to eat. Hoggett gives him a drink from a baby bottle, sings to him \"If I Had Words\" and dances a jig for him. This restores Babe's faith in Hoggett's affection and he begins eating again.\n\nAt the competition, Babe meets the sheep that he will be herding, but they ignore his attempts to speak to them. As Hoggett is criticized by the bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a dog, Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do. They give him a secret password, first extracting a promise that he will treat them better from now on. He returns in time to convey the password to Babe, and the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly. Amid the crowd's acclamation, he is unanimously given the highest score. While he sits down next to the farmer, Hoggett praises him by saying, \"That'll do, Pig. That'll do.\"\n\n\n\n48 different pigs were used for the part of Babe.\n\nAccording to actor James Cromwell, there was tension on the set between producer George Miller and director Chris Noonan. Noonan later complained, \"I don't want to make a lifelong enemy of George Miller but I thought that he tried to take credit for \"Babe\", tried to exclude me from any credit, and it made me very insecure... It was like your guru has told you that you are no good and that is really disconcerting.\"\n\nMiller shot back, “Chris said something that is defamatory: that I took his name off the credits on internet sites, which is just absolutely untrue. You know, I’m sorry but I really have a lot more to do with my life than worry about that... when it comes to \"Babe\", the vision was handed to Chris on a plate.”\n\nThe musical score for \"Babe\" was composed by Nigel Westlake and performed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Classical orchestral music by 19th-century French composers is used throughout the film, but is disguised in a variety of ways and often integrated by Westlake into his score. The theme song \"If I Had Words\" (lyrics by Jonathan Hodge), sung by Hoggett near the film's conclusion, is an adaptation of the \"Maestoso\" final movement of the \"Organ Symphony\" by Camille Saint-Saëns, and was originally performed in 1977 by Scott Fitzgerald and Yvonne Keeley. This tune also recurs throughout the film's score.\n\nThere are also brief quotations within the score from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite. Other music featured is by Leo Delibes, Richard Rodgers, Gabriel Fauré, and Georges Bizet.\n\nThe film was a box office success, grossing $36.7 million at the box office in Australia and over $254 million worldwide. It also received critical acclaim and was ultimately nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, winning Best Visual Effects. It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film. At the APRA Music Awards of 1996 it won Best Film Score for Westlake's work. In 2006, the American Film Institute named \"Babe\" #80 on its list of America's Most Inspiring Movies.\n\nBecause of its subject being a piglet, \"Babe\" was initially banned from Malaysia in order to avoid upsetting or annoying Muslims (who view pigs as haram), although the ruling was overturned almost a year later and the film was released direct-to-video.\n\nWhen \"Babe\" was released in the US, it is reported that \"activists around the country staked out movie theatres with flyers documenting the real life abuses of pigs\". The film had a marked effect on the growth of vegetarianism, particularly among the young. It also promoted a more sympathetic view of the intellectual, emotional and social capacities of animals. James Cromwell became an as a result of starring as Farmer Hoggett, saying, \"I decided that to be able to talk about this [movie] with conviction, I needed to become a vegetarian.\" In 1996 he went on to organize a vegetarian dinner for the Los Angeles homeless at a “Compassionate Christmas” event in order to reverse the barnyard view that \"Christmas is carnage\".\n\n\n"}

He is recognized as being a progenitor of both music and dance genres, and is often referred to as the \"Father of Tap Dance.\" \n\nBarney Fagan was born as Bernard J. Fagan in Boston, son of Douglass and Ellen Fagan. His father was the deputy wharfinger (old term that today is called a harbormaster) at Battery Wharf. He made his first professional appearance in Boston at the Howard Athenaeum in 1860, as the Cabin Boy in \"The Pilot of Brest\". He remained at this theatre several seasons until 1865 when he played his first minstrel engagement with the Morris Brothers in Boston.\n\nIn 1870, Fagan went to Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and appeared with Pete Lee's Minstrels. In 1873 he joined Buckley's Serenaders in Boston, and took a fellow dancer, Joe Parks, as a partner. During the period 1873-1876, Fagan and Parks, known as the American Lads, played variety engagements. In 1876 he did the famous Heifer dance with Richard Golden in \"Evangeline\". Mr. Fagan next joined John Fenton in a dancing duet, and continued with him until 1878, when he formed a partnership with Lizzie Mulvey, which lasted one season. Fagan's specialty at that time was \"clog dancing\"—which was a dance performed while wearing wooden-soled shoes, a very popular form of stage entertainment in the late 19th century.\n\nBeginning in 1879, Mr. Fagan allied himself with Barlow, Wilson, Primrose and West's Minstrels, and continued with them until the company's dissolution in June, 1882. During the three years with Barlow and Wilson, he was general producer and performed as a soloist. Possibly Mr. Fagan's greatest achievement was in organizing and producing Willis Sweatnam, Billy Rice and Fagan's Minstrels, which gave their first performance at Albany, New York, July 25, 1887. This troupe was allegedly the largest minstrel company to travel America's entertainment circuit in the 19th century, featuring 105 performers on parade with 88 in the regular company.\n\nIn the following years, Fagan performed with various companies, including Thatcher, Primrose and West; Barlow, Wilson and Rankin's; and Cleveland's Minstrels, where Fagan performed opposite to Luke Schoolcraft.\n\nOutside of minstrelsy, Fagan appeared in whiteface in such plays as \"Paradise Alley\", and, in 1890, appeared in \"High Roller\", a production of his own company. At this time, Fagan's work drew praise for notable marches, including \"West Point Cadets\", the \"Phantom Guards\" and \"The Dance of the Popinjays\". During this same period, he was general producer for Corinne for several seasons.\n\nAs a songwriter he was no less prominent, penning: \"Everybody Takes Their Hat Off to Me\" and \"My Gal is A High Born Lady\". His plays were popular, too: \"The Land of Fancy\" and \"The Game of Love\". Starting in 1895, Fagan performed regularly with Herietta Byron, of the Byron Sisters.\n\nIn the opinion of Sigmund Spaeth, Fagan's compositions were important in the development of ragtime. In his book \"A History of Popular Music in America\" (1948), Spaeth said:\n\nHe was highly revered by the end of his career. On August 31, 1919, a testimonial dinner was given in his honor in Manhattan, attracting the theatrical luminaries of that era, including Irving Berlin.\nBarney Fagan died on his 87th birthday, January 12, 1937, in Bay Shore, Long Island, New York.\n\n"}

Popular throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Baker introduced a number of ragtime and torch songs including Irving Berlin's \"Blue Skies\" and \"My Yiddishe Mama\". She performed in the Ziegfeld Follies and introduced a number of Irving Berlin's songs. An early adapter to radio, Baker hosted her own radio show during the 1930s. Eddie Cantor called her “Dinah Shore, Patti Page, Peggy Lee, Judy Garland all rolled into one.”\n\nBaker was born Bella Becker in 1893 to a Russian Jewish family. Baker started performing at the Lower East Side's Cannon Street Music Hall at age 11, where she was discovered by the Yiddish Theatre manager Jacob Adler. She was managed in vaudeville by Lew Leslie, who would become Baker's first husband. She made her vaudeville debut in Scranton, Pennsylvania at the age of 15. She performed in Oscar Hammerstein I's Victoria Theatre in 1911, although her performance was panned, mainly for her song choices. By age 17, she was a headliner. One of her earliest hits was, \"Cohen Owes Me $97\".\n\nAs Baker's fame rose as a vocalist, she became known for her Yiddish themed torch songs. In 1925, fellow vaudevillian Sophie Tucker gave Baker a song that had been sent to her for consideration. \"My Yiddishe Mama\" was a blatant tearjerker, but it was immensely popular and became Baker’s signature song. Similar songs Baker recorded included, \"My Man\", \"My Kid\", \"Baby Your Mother\" and \"My Sin\".\n\nIn 1926, Baker had the title role in Broadway's \"Betsy\". She introduced Irving Berlin's \"Blue Skies\" in the Florenz Ziegfeld production, which ran for 39 performances from December 28, 1926 to January 29, 1927. With music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart, the musical comedy had a book by Irving Caesar and David Freedman. Victor Baravelle was the musical director. Irving Berlin's \"Blue Skies\" was a last-minute addition to the show; Baker's performance of it went over so well that the audience demanded more than twenty encores of the tune.\n\nBaker had a brief film career as silent film gave way to lavish technicolor musical talkies. She made her film debut starring in the 1929 talkie \"Song of Love\". The film survives and has been screened at film festivals but not released on DVD. \"Song of Love\" features two songs performed by Baker written by her husband, \"I'm Walking with the Moonbeams (Talking to the Stars)\" and \"Take Everything But You\". She made two more film appearances, in \"Charing Cross Road\" (1935) and \"Atlantic City\" (1944; in which she performed \"Nobody's Sweetheart\").\n\nOn radio, she was a guest performer on \"The Eveready Hour\", broadcasting's first major variety show, which featured Broadway's top headliners. Baker continued performing through the 1930s, but limited her performances to radio shows.\n\nBaker's first marriage was to producer and promoter Lew Leslie. The couple divorced in 1918. In 1919, she married Maurice Abrahams, a successful Russian-American songwriter/composer, who wrote such songs as \"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\", \"He'd Have to Get Under — Get Out and Get Under (to Fix Up His Automobile)\", \"I'm Walking with the Moonbeams (Talking to the Stars)\", and \"Take Everything But You\". The couple had one child, Herbert Joseph Abrahams, later known as Herbert Baker, who became a screenwriter. After Abrahams' death in 1931, Baker restricted her performing to radio. On September 21, 1937, she remarried, to Elias Sugarman, editor of the theatrical trade magazine, \"Billboard\". The couple divorced in 1941. She made one final television appearance in \"This Is Your Life\" in 1955, just two years before her death.\n\nBaker died on April 25, 1957 at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, California. She is buried in the Abrahams family mausoleum in Mount Judah Cemetery, Ridgewood, New York.\n\n\n\n"}

Her father, Ben Brown (1848–1926), was part of the successful variety group, Brown, Newland & Le Clerc. Her mother, Marie Loftus (1857–1940), an actress, pantomimic, and music hall performer, who was only 18 years old when Cecilia was born, later became a star of burlesque, billed as \"The Sarah Bernhardt of the Halls\".\n\nShe was given an education at the Convent of the Holy Child, Raikes Parade, Blackpool, England which moved in 1890 to the premises at Layton Hill Convent, Blackpool which it still occupies although now, after various name changes, splits and mergers, it is known as St. Mary's Catholic College. In July 1893, 17-year-old Cissy Loftus made her début at the Oxford Music Hall in London, followed by an appearance at the Palace Theatre of Varieties. After an early career in music hall and variety performing impersonations of well-known actresses of the day, such as Yvette Guilbert, she appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in musical comedy for one season.\n\nIn 1894, she appeared in vaudeville at the Lyceum Theatre in New York City. Loftus toured with the Ada Rehan Company and the Augustin Daly Company before she first appeared at Koster & Bial's on 21 January 1895. With the Rehan troupe she played Washington, DC, St. Louis, Missouri, and Chicago, Illinois as \"Miss Cecile\" in a playbill. Her exit from Daly's organisation occurred after Loftus was offered larger salaries in New York City. Other roles she played prior to 1895 were \"Winnie\" in \"The Last Word\" and \"Audrey\" in \"Love's Labour's Lost\". Critics did not speak kindly of her work in these parts, to her dismay. Loftus became an international favourite in vaudeville along with Vesta Tilley and Harry Lauder.\n\nShe then began to appear in the legitimate theatre, appearing in \"The Children of the King\" at the Royal Court Theatre, in 1898. The following year she returned to the United States to tour in vaudeville and was seen by Sir Henry Irving in 1901 at the Knickerbocker Theatre. He was so impressed that he engaged her to appear with him in the roles that Dame Ellen Terry could no longer play. She later toured with Irving, although the earnings were not as great as those on the music hall circuit. In 1905, she successfully essayed the very serious role of Nora in Henrik Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\". Later that year she played Peter Pan to considerable acclaim in the second British production of Barrie's play. The next year she toured with \"The Diamond Express\" and appeared at the Royal Variety Performance at the Palace Theatre in 1912. In 1914, Loftus played the part of Desdemona in \"Othello\" at the Lyric Theatre (New York).\n\nShe had a successful career both in burlesque, as an accomplished mimic, and on Broadway. Some of the productions she appeared in are \"The Man of Forty\" (1900), \"If I Were King\" (1901) by her husband Justin Huntly McCarthy, \"Hamlet\" (1903) with E.H. Sothern, the Victor Herbert operetta \"Dream City\" (1906), \"Venus\" (1927) with Tyrone Power, Sr., \"Three-Cornered Moon\" (1933) with Ruth Gordon, Clare Boothe Luce's \"Abide With Me\" (1935), and \"Little Dark Horse\" (1941). As Cissie Loftus, she wrote lyrics and music for songs in a number of productions, including \"The Belle of Bridgeport\" (1900) and \"The Lancers\" (1907).\n\nWhen she was seventeen, she eloped with Justin Huntly McCarthy (1859–1936), an Irish writer, and associate of her friend and admirer Max Beerbohm. They married in Blackburn, Lancashire in 1893. The groom was twice as old as the bride. The marriage failed, and the couple divorced.\n\nIn 1908, she married Alonzo Higbee Waterman, an American doctor. By 1914, both her marriage and health were in a perilous state, and an acrimonious divorce ensued in 1920. Her health and the premature birth of their son, Peter, had made her increasingly dependent on alcohol and painkillers. In November 1922, she was arrested for possession of morphine and atropine.\n\nHer fellow actress, Eva Moore bailed her for a surety of £100, and she was put on probation for twelve months at the Great Marlborough Street Magistrates Court. In 1923, she left Great Britain for good, and sailed to New York City to return to Broadway and pursue a career in Hollywood.\n\nLoftus also appeared in cinema from the 1910s to the 1940s, with roles that included \"Clorinda Widairs\" in \"A Lady of Quality\" (1913), \"Mrs. Sinclair\" in \"Young Sinners\" (1931) and “Grandmother Lovell” in The Old Maid (1939) \"Granny Tyl\" in \"The Blue Bird\" (1940).\n\nCecilia Loftus died from a heart attack and the effects of alcoholism at the Lincoln Hotel in New York City, on 12 July 1943, aged 66. Her mother had predeceased her by only three years. She is buried in Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, Westchester County, New York, in a plot provided by the Actors' Fund.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3996534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3996534", "title": "Comus (Milton)", "text": "Comus (Milton)\n\nComus (A Masque Presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634) is a masque in honour of chastity, written by John Milton. It was first presented on Michaelmas, 1634, before John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater, at Ludlow Castle in celebration of the Earl's new post as Lord President of Wales.\n\nKnown colloquially as \"Comus\", the masque's actual full title is \"A Mask presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634: on Michelmas night, before the Rt Hon. Iohn Earl of Bridgewater, Viscount Brackly, Lord President of Wales, and one of His Maiesties most honorable privie councill\". \"Comus\" was printed anonymously in 1637, in a quarto issued by bookseller Humphrey Robinson; Milton included the work in his \"Poems\" of 1645 and 1673. Milton's text was later used for a highly successful masque by the musician Thomas Arne in 1738, which then ran for more than seventy years in London.\n\nThe plot concerns two brothers and their sister, simply called \"the Lady\", lost in a journey through the woods. The Lady becomes fatigued, and the brothers wander off in search of sustenance.\n\nWhile alone, she encounters the debauched \"Comus\", a character inspired by the god of revelry (Ancient Greek: Κῶμος), who is disguised as a villager and claims he will lead her to her brothers. Deceived by his amiable countenance, the Lady follows him, only to be captured, brought to his pleasure palace and victimised by his necromancy. Seated on an enchanted chair, with \"gums of glutinous heat\", she is immobilised, and Comus accosts her while with one hand he holds a necromancer's wand and with the other he offers a vessel with a drink that would overpower her. Comus urges the Lady to \"be not coy\" and drink from his magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), but she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity. Within view at his palace is an array of cuisine intended to arouse the Lady's appetites and desires. Despite being restrained against her will, she continues to exercise right reason (recta ratio) in her disputation with Comus, thereby manifesting her freedom of mind. Whereas the would-be seducer argues appetites and desires issuing from one's nature are \"natural\" and therefore licit, the Lady contends that only rational self-control is enlightened and virtuous. To be self-indulgent and intemperate, she adds, is to forfeit one's higher nature and to yield to baser impulses. In this debate the Lady and Comus signify, respectively, soul and body, ratio and libido, sublimation and sensuality, virtue and vice, moral rectitude and immoral depravity. In line with the theme of the journey that distinguishes Comus, the Lady has been deceived by the guile of a treacherous character, temporarily waylaid, and besieged by sophistry that is disguised as wisdom.\n\nMeanwhile, her brothers, searching for her, come across the \"Attendant Spirit\", an angelic figure sent to aid them, who takes the form of a shepherd and tells them how to defeat Comus. As the Lady continues to assert her freedom of mind and to exercise her free will by resistance and even defiance, she is rescued by the \"Attendant Spirit\" along with her brothers, who chase off Comus. The Lady remains magically bound to her chair. With a song, the Spirit conjures the water nymph \"Sabrina\" who frees the Lady on account of her steadfast virtue. She and her brothers are reunited with their parents in a triumphal celebration, which signifies the heavenly bliss awaiting the wayfaring soul that prevails over trials and travails, whether these are the threats posed by overt evil or the blandishments of temptation.\n\nThe original music, in a baroque style, was composed by Henry Lawes, who also played the part of The Attendant Spirit. Generally, masques were not dramas; they could be viewed as pre-figuring the recitative of opera.\n\nIn 1745 George Frideric Handel composed three songs and a trio as part of a private arrangement of the masque which was first performed, in June 1745, also at Ludlow Castle.\n\nMasques were a favourite court celebration dating from at least the reign of Elizabeth I, but became very popular under the Stuarts. The main parts were often played by courtiers, nobles and sometimes even the royals. In fact, Caroline masques (of which \"Comus\" is an example) frequently featured the King and Queen (Henrietta Maria), as they were far more interested in becoming involved than King James and his queen Anne had been.\n\nThis masque was not performed at the court, however, but at the home of Lord Bridgewater, Ludlow Castle. It was commissioned to celebrate the appointment of Lord Bridgewater to the post of Lord President of Wales. References to this are clearly evident in the text, such as the Attendant Spirit's reference to the children's father's \"new-entrusted sceptre\" in his opening speech.\n\nBridgewater's own children were the principal actors in this masque. The Puritan Milton's use of the genre, however, may be seen as an attempt for him to \"reclaim\" masque, which was associated with the perceived debauchery of the royal court, for godly or virtuous purposes. Rather than praising an aristocrat, the famous concluding lines of the masque, recited by the Attendant Spirit, urge\n\n\"Comus\" was influenced by a prior masque, Aurelian Townshend's \"Tempe Restored\", which had been staged at Whitehall Palace in London in February 1632. Both Henry Lawes and Alice Egerton, the Earl's daughter who played the Lady, had performed in Townshend's masque.\n\nMilton's title for the masque was not \"Comus\" (this was imposed later by scholars), but \"A Mask, Presented at Ludlow Castle\". Creaser notes that it had become old-fashioned by the 1630s to use an occasional title such as this (consider other masque titles of the time such as Carew's \"Coelum Britanicum\" and \"Tempe Restored\", etc.) This shows that Milton wanted to specifically draw attention to his work as a masque, asking the reader to hold in their minds all that this signified, as he consciously used and twisted the conventions of the genre to put across his particular message. For example, his audience would have been expecting, based on other masques of this time, that the antimasque would be dispelled by virtue (usually embodied by the King and Queen). Yet in Comus the Lady's virtue is not enough to save her: she is unable to dismiss Comus on her own. Even the heroic virtue of her brothers is not enough. Comus escapes rather than actually being defeated.\n\nMany have read the intervention of Sabrina as divine assistance being sent, showing that earthly virtue is relatively weak, and certainly not worthy of the exaltation given it in contemporary masques. Barbara Lewalski comments that the character of Sabrina was apparently not played by a noble, but by one of the actors (we can assume this because no-one is listed as playing this character in the dramatis personae), so it is actually a commoner who holds the position of most power.\n\nAn air of controversy surrounds this masque, as the Earl of Castlehaven, Bridgewater's brother-in-law, was the subject of a sordid sodomy and rape scandal for which he was executed. Some critics have conjectured that the masque, with its focus on chastity, was designed to \"cleanse\" the Egerton family.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47676981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47676981", "title": "Concussions in Australian sport", "text": "Concussions in Australian sport\n\nHead injuries in sports of any level (junior, amateur, professional) are the most dangerous and sickening kind of injuries that can occur in sport, and are becoming more common in Australian sport. Concussions are the most common side effect of a head injury and are defined as \"temporary unconsciousness or confusion and other symptoms caused by a blow to the head.\" A concussion also falls under the category of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Especially in contact sports like Australian rules football and Rugby issues with concussions are prevalent, and methods to deal with, prevent and treat concussions are continuously being updated and researched to deal with the issue. Concussions pose a serious threat to the patients’ mental and physical health, as well as their playing career, and can result in lasting brain damage especially if left untreated. The signs that a player may have a concussion are: loss of consciousness or non-responsiveness, balance problems (unsteadiness on feet, poor co-ordination), a dazed, blank or vacant look and/or confusion and unawareness of their surroundings. Of course the signs are relevant only after the player experiences a blow to the head.\n\nIn the short term, concussions do not pose a serious problem and a player suffering may experience: headache, dizziness, loss of memory, blurred vision, confusion, disorientation and /or sensitiveness to bright light and loud noises. However, the real danger occurs after repeated concussions suffered by the same player, if the player returns to play immediately after contracting a concussion or too soon after suffering one. If the player returns to play immediately or too soon after, there is an increased risk of another concussion (which is much more serious) as well as to the rest of the body due to a slower reaction time. The player can also suffer from a number of psychological issues like depression, as well as permanent brain damage and severe brain swelling. A player, regardless of age or level of competition, should not return to play or training following a concussion, without a medical clearance from a registered medical doctor.\n\nIn a high-impact game like Australian Rules Football, head injuries and concussions have always been common, but public awareness has risen over the last decade towards the dangers of continuing to play while suffering from a concussion. It is estimated that there are 5–6 players who suffer a concussion for every 1000 hours spent on the field, meaning there are 6–7 concussions per team during one season. Previously, players at the elite level, either realised they would be pulled out of the game if they were identified as concussed hid the fact from coaches and continued to play, but recently the AFL released new concussion management guidelines to combat the issue. Now, only a medical officer with previous experience in the subject may declare the player fit to play, also the coaches are warned against rushing their players back into the team after suffering a concussion. The guidelines also dictate that immediately, or as soon as possible, after a player suffers a concussion, or is suspected of suffering from one, they must be subjected to a medical assessment after which they may or may not be allowed to return to the field depending on the results. Introduced in 2013 in the AFL, the 'concussion sub' can be used when a player suffers a concussion or is suspected of having one, the player in question is substituted out of the game for at least 20 minutes, during which a test takes place to evaluate the players psychological well-being.\n\nThe occurrence of concussions in amateur leagues are less common because of the lower impact intensity. However, concussions suffered at amateur levels can at times be more dangerous then those suffered in the AFL because of the inferior resources possessed and in some cases the coaches are not willing to pull a player out of the game, or rest them if they are suffering from a concussion. A study conducted by the Australian Football Injury Prevention Project (AFIPP) in 2002 showed that out of 301 players (who play for amateur clubs in the Melbourne metropolitan area), 14 suffered from a form of head knock, 7 of which resulted in concussion. 18.9% of players participating in the test suffered from concussion, bearing in mind that the sample size is also small.\n\nA separate study showed that out of 1015 Australian Rules Football players tested, 78 of them were concussed, 9 of which were concussed multiple times. The players mental functions were tested at controlled intervals with 38.6% of players still displaying symptoms at 48 hours after being concussed but after 96 hours, only 1.1% displayed any symptoms.\n\nCricket is classified differently to high intensity sports like Australian rules football and rugby, due to the stop-start nature of the game rather than continuous flowing play. However, due to the speed of fast bowlers and the hardness of cricket balls, cricket is still very much a high impact sport. Out of all Australian sporting codes, cricket requires the most protective gear to properly guard batsmen from a variety of injuries that can be afflicted all over the body. The most important piece of protective gear is the helmet, which includes a grill covering the face, to protect batsmen from head injuries. In the most recent Australian tour of the West Indies, now former Australian batsmen Chris Rogers suffered a concussion during training and was ruled out of the test series without playing a match. This has led Cricket Australia to plan out an updated concussion policy and guidelines The principles are based on the International Consensus Conferences on Concussion in Sport (the Zurich Guidelines) and involve the player suspected of being concussed answering a set of questions to determine whether he has to leave the field. While concussion in cricket is considered quite rare due to increasingly safer helmets, the effects can be quite severe. NSW batsmen Ben Rohrer was struck in the head by a cricket ball during a Sheffield Shield match against Victoria in November last year, he recalls his legs feeling like jelly and falling over on the pitch. The most widely known case is the death of NSW batsmen Phillip Hughes who died after being receiving a cricket ball to the head in 2014.\n\nA study conducted with 542 junior cricket players revealed only 13% of injuries were limited to the facial region, and none of them suffered a concussion.\n\nMost popular in New South Wales and Queensland, rugby can be classified into two different codes, rugby union and rugby league. Both are played at a very high level of intensity with full contact allowed, and as such has one of the highest concussion rates in the world, let alone Australia. Studies conducted into the incidence of concussion in professional and amateur levels of rugby have revealed that approximately 3.9 concussions per 1000 hours of play occur in professional rugby (1 concussion in every 6 games). Playing at the amateur level, concussion rates are much lower measured at 1 in every 21 matches (1.2 per 1000 hours). This amounts to roughly 5–7 concussions per team per season.\n\nThe National Rugby League released a 4 step set of guidelines, in 2012, for all coaches to follow in the case one of their players suffering a concussion during a game. The guidelines detail that the player be given basic first aid before being assessed by a medical officer, they also stress heavily that if the player is determined to be concussed there is no way the player should return to the field. if the concussion is serious, the player should be sent as soon as possible to hospital for medical treatment.\n\nWearing protective gear, such as a helmet and mouthguard, can reduce the chances of sustaining a concussion.\n\nThe occurrence of concussion in children during sport is significantly more likely compared to other levels of athletes. Roughly 20% of children playing sport are diagnosed with concussion. Despite the lower level of impact compared to the professional or amateur levels, children's neck muscles are quite weak and most lack the awareness and skill level to cushion or prepare themselves for a blow leading to a high concussion rate. The guidelines and protocols for a child suffering a concussion are basically the same as if an adult received one.\n\nFor a child diagnosed with a concussion, the real issue is returning to school rather than the sporting field, as a concussion can affect a child's learning ability. A medical clearance is required before a return to school is possible and parents are recommended to properly manage their child through the first 72 hours after experiencing a concussion.\n\nConcussions in sport\n"}
{"id": "39248671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39248671", "title": "Constitutive rhetoric", "text": "Constitutive rhetoric\n\nConstitutive rhetoric is a theory of discourse devised by James Boyd White about the capacity of language or symbols to create a collective identity for an audience, especially by means of condensation symbols, literature, and narratives. Such discourse often demands that action be taken to reinforce the identity and the beliefs of that identity. White explains that it denotes “the art of constituting character, community and culture in language.”\n\nThe constitutive model of rhetoric dates back to the ancient Greek Sophists, with theories that speech moved audiences to action based on a contingent, shared knowledge. Kenneth Burke contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric by highlighting identification, rather than persuasion, as the major means by which language functioned. Burke contended that social identity is founded “spontaneously, intuitively, even unconsciously.” Edwin Black's theory of the second persona also aided scholars in rhetoric to analyze the imagined shared values and beliefs between speaker and audience through textual analysis. Audience must adopt a particular ethos prior to being persuaded by constitutive rhetoric, thus the ethos of the subject of discourse can be critically studied and interpreted through a text.\n\nWhile these theorists all contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric, James Boyd White was the first to coin the term. In 1985, he explained that the term “constitutive rhetoric” described rhetoric that called a common, collective identity into existence. White wrote that persuasion and identification occur only when audiences already understand and relate to method and content. Thus, speech happens within culture, and speakers adapt messages to reflect the ideas and views of a community. When speeches address a diverse crowd as though they are of one community, White describes this as “calling [identity] into being” through material identification.\n\nAccording to White, there are two methods of convincing an audience that they belong to an identity. The first is \"peithõ\", persuasion, and the second is deceitful manipulation, or \"dolos\". Using \"peithõ\", speakers convince audiences of shared identity openly and honestly. \"Dolos\" creates belonging through deceit.\n\nIn 1987, Maurice Charland further emphasized the importance of the narrative and Marxist theory He observed, “While classical narratives have an ending, constitutive rhetorics leave the task of narrative closure to their constituted subjects”. Charland’s theory draws from Burke and the philosopher Louis Althusser. Althusser explained interpellation, or \"hailing,\" as the social phenomenon of a mass audience having already been “recruited” by an ideology. Ideologies create subjects of discourse for persuasion by further discourse.\nIn other words, “the very existence of social subjects (who would become audience members) is already a rhetorical effect.” \n\nPolitical speeches, manifestos, and resistance movements participate in this type of discourse, to establish an identity and a call to action within that identity. A leader’s speech calling a “nation” to war establishes a national identity within the discourse or text. A feminist speaking on women’s right establishes the identity of the “woman”. An African-American protesting during the Civil Rights Movement established an “African-American” identity. Every audience member may take part in shared identity because of common symbolic resources, even as the text may especially interpellate a smaller sub-group of the audience. An identity must be established in contrast to another identity. This creates divisions between “us” and “them,” sometimes creating extreme divisions between different identifications.\n\nIn 2015, Halstrøm and Galle picked up on constitutive rhetoric within the field of design studies. They explained how it may provide useful concepts for analysing designed artefacts. Design may be said to aim at providing an audience with a subject position, which it is to confirm. Thus, it aims at persuading by seeking to constitute its audience.\n\nConstitutive rhetoric and theories of logical persuasion (such as New Criticism or Neo-Aristotelianism) can be used together, but constitutive rhetoric presumes that belief and identity always precedes logical persuasion. Thus, constitutive rhetoric must address the previous identity and must either coincide with it, or change it.\n\nJacques Derrida criticized the paradox of constitutive rhetoric when he analyzed the United States Declaration of Independence. He explained that the men signing the Declaration claimed to be representatives of “the people,” but the people were not yet defined as a nation until that Declaration was signed. His criticism explains that an identity must be established before that identity exists in order for the speaker to represent the ideals of that identity, thus creating a paradoxical relationship in which only a third perspective can truly analyze the identity of the audience.\n\n"}

{"id": "378672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378672", "title": "Dangdut", "text": "Dangdut\n\nDangdut () is a genre of Indonesian folk and traditional popular music that is partly derived from Hindustani, Malay, and Arabic music. Dangdut is a very popular genre in Indonesia because of its melodious instrumentation and vocals. Indonesians dance in somewhat similar to the ghoomar while listening to dangdut music, but in a much slower version. Dangdut features a tabla and gendang beat.\n\nOne of the most popular Dangdut musicians and singers such as Rhoma Irama, known as the \"King of Dangdut\"; Mansyur S.; Meggy Z; and Ellya Khadam include strong Indian-music influence in the basis of harmony, theme, and beat to their songs and also by other popular dangdut singers also.\n\nDangdut is very popular throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and other Malay-speaking lands.\n\nA dangdut band typically consists of a lead singer, male or female, backed by four to eight musicians. Instruments usually include a tabla, gendang, flute, mandolin, guitars, sitar, drum machines, and synthesizers. The term has been expanded from the desert-style music to embrace other musical styles. Modern dangdut incorporates influences from Middle Eastern pop music, Western rock, house music, hip hop music, contemporary R&B, and reggae.\n\nThe popularity of Dangdut peaked in the 1990s. By 2012, it was mostly popular in the western parts of Indonesia and not in the eastern parts, apart from Maluku.\n\nThe term \"dangdut\" is a Javanese language onomatopoeia for the sound of the \"tabla\" (also known as \"gendang\") drum, which is written \"dang\" and \"ndut\". It was reportedly coined by music magazine \"Aktuil\", although Rhoma Irama stated that it was coined as a term of derision by the rich to the music of the poor. Despite its derogatory intent, it was seized upon by those playing it, and the term appears in Rhoma's 1973 dangdut classic \"Terajana\":\n\nDangdut as a term distinguished the music of Javanese from the Orkes Melayu of North Sumatran Malays.\n\nBesides orkes Melayu, the primary musical influence on dangdut was Indian Bollywood music. The song \"Terajana\" pays homage to the 1959 Bollywood hit \"Tera Jana Ke,\" and though dangdut is primarily written in the Indonesian language, respect was paid to the Indian influence. The next verse of \"Terajana\" is as follows:\n\nOrkes Melayu singer Ellya Khadam switched to dangdut in the 1970s, and, by 1972, she was the number-one artist in Indonesia. Her success, with that of Rhoma Irama, meant that by 1975, 75 percent of all recorded music in Indonesia was of the dangdut genre, with pop bands such as Koes Plus adopting the style.\n\nMost major cities, especially on Java, have one or more venues that have a dangdut show several times a week. The concerts of major dangdut stars are also broadcast on television.\n\nBeginning in 2003, certain dangdut musicians became the focus of a national controversy in Indonesia regarding performances by singer Inul Daratista, which religious conservatives described as pornography. Protests led by dangdut megastar and devout Muslim Rhoma Irama called for Daratista to be banned from television, and legislation was passed in 2008 by the People's Consultative Assembly that introduced a broad range of activities described as pornography.\n\nThe flamboyant performances at some dangdut shows also attracted collateral attention in May 2012 when a row broke out in Indonesia over a planned performance by international star Lady Gaga in Jakarta due to be held in early June 2012. In the face of opposition from conservative Muslim groups in Indonesia, the planned show was canceled. This cancelation led numerous commentators to note that opposition to Lady Gaga's performances was surprising given the nature of some dangdut shows.\n\nDangdut remains an integral part of Indonesian life and pop culture despite conservative Muslim concerns over the supposed vulgarity of some performances (such as by Julia Perez).\n\nBecause the popularity of the genre, some movies and TV show have dangdut-centered themes, such as Rhoma Irama's movies and Rudy Soedjarwo's \"Mendadak Dangdut\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The conspiracy theory that Presley did not die and instead went into hiding was popularized by Gail Brewer-Giorgio and other authors.\n\nThe earliest known alleged sighting was at the Memphis International Airport where a man resembling Presley gave the name \"Jon Burrows\", which was the same name Presley used when booking hotels. A series of alleged sightings took place in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the late 1980s. Such reports encountered much public ridicule and became fodder for humorous publications like the \"Weekly World News\".\n\nPresley was rumored to have appeared in the background of an airport scene in the 1990 film \"Home Alone\". It was alleged that a bearded man wearing a turtleneck and a sports jacket could be seen over the left shoulder of Catherine O'Hara's character while she is arguing with an airline employee. Paranormal researcher Ben Radford responded to Elvis sighting believers with \"Why fake your death and then turn up as an extra in a popular movie? How could the cast and crew have failed to notice the presence of one of the most famous figures in the world? Even if he looked very different could he have disguised his voice and mannerisms?\". Radford was challenged to find the actor who played that part to prove it was not Presley. He explained that the burden of proof was on the person making the claim. In an interview with \"USA Today\", director Chris Columbus responded \"If Elvis was on the set, I would have known\".\n\nAfter being challenged by Radford to locate the true identity of this extra, Kenny Biddle investigated and found the man to be Gary Richard Grott, who passed away of a heart attack in February 2016. Biddle located Grott's son, Roman, who explained that his father was indeed the extra in the airport scene of \"Home Alone\", and that he had known director Chris Columbus personally. Because of this he appeared in a number of his movies as an extra, including \"Home Alone\".\n\nBill Bixby, who co-starred with Presley in \"Clambake\" and \"Speedway\", hosted two television specials investigating the conspiracy: \"The Elvis Files\" (1991) and \"The Elvis Conspiracy\" (1992).

From then on, the event maintained the biennial periodicity. By 2011, in addition to the guest of honor, there was also a country honored. As of the 2013 edition, the event didn't have honored countries, having instead exhibitions and guests from many different countries. In every edition, a Brazilian artist is chosen as a guest of honor, with exhibitions about his work. This guest, generally, is also responsible for the illustration of the event's poster. In 2017, the event was not held due to lack of money from the city of Belo Horizonte. The edition of that year was transferred to the first semester of 2018, happening to be realized biennial in the even years from then on.\n\nThe Festival Internacional de Quadrinhos won Troféu HQ Mix, the main Brazilian comic award, in the \"Best Event\" category in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014. Some of the exhibitions held at FIQ were also awarded in the \"Best Exhibition\" category: \"Angeli, o matador\" (2000), \"Mozart Couto\" (2004), \"Batman 70 Anos\" (2010), \"Criando Quadrinhos - da ideia à página impressa\" (2012) e \"Ícones dos Quadrinhos\" (2014).\n\nThe festival also received, in 2012, the Jayme Cortez Trophy, destined to reward great contributions to Brazilian comics.\n"}

The MBO saw the company de-listing from the stock exchange (whilst retaining its plc status) and moving its operations to Leicester.\n\nAt that time, the Health and Fitness chain was spun off as Esporta.\n\nBy 2004, the company had shrunk its operations from 50 to 25 nightclubs; in so doing, it had sold its premises leases to rival operators. A clause of such sales mandated that should those new operators be unable to meet their obligations under the leases that they would be automatically reassigned to First Leisure with little warning or ceremony.\n\nAt the end of 2004, such an automatic reassignment took place following competitors' defaults on a number of previously sold leases. Unable to meet the dramatically increased month-to-month obligations brought about by this mandatory re-acquisition, the company was subject to a Winding Up Order by a trade creditor and hence placed into Compulsory Liquidation by the Official Receiver.\n\nA 'Phoenix' company, named The Nightclub Company, was formed virtually immediately by the incumbent management team. Such an operation was short-lived, however, and it too was placed into administration in 2005. The precise circumstances regarding the collapse of TNC are unclear.\n\nThe remaining leases were sold, mostly to long-time rival Luminar Leisure.\n\nAll that remains of the corporation as of 2007 is the Esporta health and fitness chain.\n\n\n"}

It has the premise of mixing real-time strategy, role-playing video game and simulation game.\n\nThe player takes the role of Mario Mangano, whose four brothers, Romano, Angelo, Sonny, and the eldest Chico, are caporegime of the Mangano crime family based in Palermo. When their father, the Don of the Borgata, dies, a power struggle hits the family and ends with Chico being nominated as the new boss. Romano, Angelo, and Sonny murder Chico after his promotion and flip away from Italy to the new world, escaping the police manhunt meant to capture them. Two years later, Mario's uncle Vincenzo Mangano calls Mario's grandfather and says that the three brothers are in his city, Paradise City. The single-player campaign begins when Mario is sent to Paradise City by his grandfather to work under Vincenzo until he is powerful enough to hunt down and kill the three murderous brothers.\n\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nA common criticism of \"Gangland\" was its repetitive gameplay. The game also suffered from a poorly implemented checkpoint saving system, as well as game mechanics that would discourage the use of certain units because of future penalties. Some of the actions a player could perform could be considered game breaking actions (such as the permanent destruction of vital resources) that could ruin multiplayer games.\n\n\"Maxim\" gave it a score of eight out of ten, saying, \"It ain't pretty, but it's business.\" \"Playboy\" gave it 75%, saying, \"Think of this strategy game as \"The Sims\" meets \"The Sopranos\".\" However, \"The Times\" gave it three stars out of five, saying, \"Releasing a game without a save mode is a brave move; releasing a game without a save mode because you forgot is just worrying. For those of you hoping to play \"Gangland\" and complete it, my advice is to wait until a save patch becomes available, supposedly in the next month or so.\"\n\nOn October 1, 2007, publisher CDV announced that \"Escape From Paradise City\" had gone gold and would be available later that month. \"Escape from Paradise City\" was developed by Sirius Games.\n"}

Located in Scarborough, Maine, the program is an extracurricular activity for any children in grades three through twelve who wish to participate.\n\nThis is the Gym Dandies' mission statement, according to their website:\n\"'The Gym Dandies' is not about winning or [losing]. The primary goal of this program is to help children develop motor skills, confidence, and self-esteem in a noncompetitive atmosphere. Ultimately, participants will apply their skills cooperatively in performances for the purpose of entertainment.\n\nThe group generally only does performances around New England, especially in the states of Maine and New Hampshire, however they have also been to the National Independence Day Parade three times (2000 2004,2006 and 2011), the Montreal Bicycle Festival (2002), the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (2005), the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade (2008 and 2012). Most recently the group was invited to participate in the 2013 Presidential Inaugural Day Parade in Washington D.C. (2013). The Gym Dandies were also an annual participant in the Maine State Parade until it was cancelled. The children's circus has also been featured twice on the PBS show, \"Zoom\".\n\nMany times, the Gym Dandies will visit other schools around New England to give lessons and community performances. They often leave a lasting impression, and many schools are motivated to start their own circus arts program. In addition to this, there is an annual performance for the town of Scarborough.\n\nA list of the circus arts equipment that the group uses in its performances:\n\nThe Gym Dandies\" Children’s Circus of Scarborough, Maine came into existence when Jon Cahill, the director of this group, began incorporating circus skills into the physical education program. Mr. Cahill soon realized that circus arts had the potential to be much more than just an alternate activity in the physical education curriculum. There were numerous potential benefits that could be realized by children as a result of participating in this unusual, challenging, and exciting endeavor. But, something was missing. The children loved to demonstrate their skills. They wanted to perform, and this was the birth of \"The Gym Dandies\".\n\nIn 1981, \"The Gym Dandies\", the little \"Big Top\" of Scarborough, consisted of ten enthusiastic fifth and sixth grade boys and girls and a box full of tennis balls. Circus arts are naturally motivating for children at this age and soon it became obvious that juggling, although challenging, was not enough. \"The Gym Dandies\" held what might have been the \"World’s First Juggle -A-Thon\" in the spring of 1981. Funds raised from the Juggle-A-Thon went toward the purchase of unicycles. By the spring of 1982, after a great deal of hard work, “The Gym Dandies\" had evolved into a stylized unicycling and juggling group normally found only in professional circuses.\n\nApproximately 230 children now participate each school year. There are beginner and advanced groups and each member meets once a week to practice. The age range of participants is 8 to 18 hears years old. Well over 4,000\nScarborough, Maine school children have participated in the Gym Dandies circus arts program since 1981.\n"}

Crews of five athletes alternately push their canoe across the ice on the frozen parts of the river, and paddle in a river with currents of four knots, tides of over 15 feet, and ice blocks weighing a few tonnes blown by the wind. Shoes with bolts screwed to the bottom are worn to keep their traction on the ice.\n\nIce canoeing has been practised since the beginnings of New France in the 1600s, as the only way to cross the Saint Lawrence River when there is too much ice for ferries, but not enough to form an ice bridge. In the 1860s more than 200 canoers, mostly at Lévis provided transportation for passengers and goods. Ice canoeing was practised in Montreal from the early 1800s. The advent of steamboats capable of breaking through the ice put an end to icecanoeing as a means of transportation in the late 1800s. \n\nIn 1894, the first race was organised between Lévis and the Port of Quebec at the first Quebec Winter Carnival. In Montreal races were held during the Fête des Neiges de Montréal from 1988 to 1992. In 2013, Héritage Maritime Canada relaunched the race as the Défi canot à glace Bota Bota. Since the 1990s races have also been held at Toronto, Windsor, Gatineau, Trois-Rivières, Chicoutimi and the Isle-aux-Coudres.\n\nWomen have competed since 1987.\n\nThe Association des Coureurs en Canot à Glace du Québec (ACCGQ) was formed in 1984 to organise and standardise races. Six races are accredited by the ACCGQ: La Grande Traversée Casino de Charlevoix, La Course en canot du Carnaval, La course de la banquise de Portneuf, Trois-Rivières Extrême, le Défi Canot à Glace Montréal, and le Grand Défi des Glaces. The latter is the biggest event. It is run during the Quebec Winter Carnival, at Quebec City every February. More than 40 teams compete, struggling with the powerful current, large chunks of ice and cold water. The Quebec City area is the centre of ice canoeing activity, but there are teams elsewhere in the province of Quebec. A crew from Calgary has competed in the race for at least 41 years. The race has also seen teams from Chicago and France.\n\nAthletes compete in three classes: elite men, elite women, and sport, the latter comprising crews of men, and crews of mixed men and women.\n\nOriginally wooden, canoes are now made with epoxy and fibreglass with an internal metal frame. The minimum weight of a canoe is for the sport and elite men classes, and for elite women. The length of the boat must be between and . Boats must contain 100 litres of flotation material, and it must be possible to float the boat with 700 litres of water on board. Canoes must be brightly-coloured and not painted white. \n\n"}

She received an Oscar nomination and won a Cannes Film Festival Award for her performance in the 1960 film \"Never on Sunday\". Mercouri was also nominated for three Golden Globes and two BAFTA Awards in her acting career.\n\nAs a politician, she was a member of the PASOK and the Hellenic Parliament. In October 1981, Mercouri became the first female Minister of Culture and Sports.\n\nMercouri was born in 1920 to a former cavalry officer and member of the Greek parliament, Stamatis Mercouris, and his wife, Eirini Lappa. When she completed her secondary education, she attended the National Theatre's Drama School, graduating in 1944. Mercouri's first husband was a wealthy landowner, Panos Harokopos; the couple divorced in 1962. \n\nAs an actress, Mercouri made her film debut in \"Stella\" (1955) and met international success with her performances in \"Never on Sunday\" (1960, with future husband Jules Dassin), \"Phaedra\", \"Topkapi\", and \"Promise at Dawn\". She won the award for Best Actress at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. She was nominated for an Academy Award, a Tony Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and two BAFTA Awards.\n\nA political activist during the Greek military junta of 1967–1974, Mercouri became a member of the Hellenic Parliament in 1977 and became the first female Minister for Culture of Greece in 1981. In 1983, Mercouri proposed the programme of the European Capital of Culture, which was established by the European Union in 1985.\n\nMercouri was a strong advocate for the return to Athens of the Parthenon Marbles, which were removed from the Parthenon, and are now displayed in the British Museum in London.\n\nAfter her graduation, Mercouri joined the National Theatre of Greece and played the role of Electra in Eugene O'Neill's play \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" in 1945. In 1949, she had her first major success in the theatre playing Blanche DuBois in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", written by Tennessee Williams and staged by Karolos Koun's Art Theatre. Until 1950, she also worked in the same theatre in other plays by Aldous Huxley, Arthur Miller and André Roussin.\n\nMercouri then moved to Paris, where she appeared in boulevard plays by Jacques Deval and Marcel Achard, and met famous French playwrights and novelists such as Jean Cocteau, Jean-Paul Sartre, Colette and Françoise Sagan. In 1953, Mercouri received the Marika Kotopouli Prize.\n\nMercouri returned to Greece in 1955. At the Kotopouli-Rex Theatre, Mercouri starred in \"Macbeth\" by William Shakespeare and \"L'Alouette\" by Jean Anouilh. \n\nMercouri's first movie was the Greek language film \"Stella\" (1955), directed by \"Zorba the Greek\" director Michael Cacoyannis. The film received special praise at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, where she met American film director Jules Dassin, with whom she would share not only her career but also her life. Their first professional pairing was 1957's \"He Who Must Die\". Other films by Dassin and featuring Mercouri followed, such as \"The Law\" (1959).\n\nMercouri became well-known to international audiences when she starred in \"Never on Sunday\" (1960), in which Dassin was the director and co-star. For this film, she earned the Best Actress Award at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.\n\nAfter her first major international success, Mercouri went on to star in \"Phaedra\" (1962), for which she was nominated again for the BAFTA Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Drama. The recognition of her acting talent did not stop though, as her role in \"Topkapi\" (1964) granted her one more nomination, this time for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Mercouri worked with such directors as Joseph Losey, Vittorio De Sica, Ronald Neame, Carl Foreman, Norman Jewison, and starred in films like Spanish language \"The Uninhibited\" by Juan Antonio Bardem.\n\nMercouri continued her stage career in the Greek production of Tennessee Williams's \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" (1960), under the direction of Karolos Koun. In 1967, she played the leading role in \"Illya Darling\" (from 11 April 1967 to 13 January 1968) on Broadway, for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical. Mercouri's performance in \"Promise at Dawn\" (1970) earned her another Golden Globe Award nomination.\n\nOn 8 October 1962, Mercouri appeared on the American TV show \"What's My Line\". After the panel were blindfolded, a strange man appeared on-stage and proclaimed himself \"the second mystery guest\". Host John Charles Daly quickly called for \"the relieving unit\" and said \"schedule two\" (a coded phrase used on live broadcasts in case of an emergency: the cameras are turned to a neutral position and the sound is cut off). The man talked a bit about a dating service he apparently owned before being hustled off the stage by announcer Johnny Olson and executive producer Gil Fates. Daly apologized to the panel and the program continued.\n\nMercouri concentrated on her stage career for the following years, playing in the Greek productions of \"The Threepenny Opera\" and, for a second time, \"Sweet Bird of Youth\", in addition to the ancient Greek tragedies \"Medea\" and \"Oresteia\". She retired from film acting in 1978, when she played in her last film, \"A Dream of Passion\", directed by her husband, Jules Dassin. Mercouri's last performance on stage was in the opera \"Pylades\" at the Athens Concert Hall in 1992, portraying Clytemnestra.\n\nOne of her first songs was by Manos Hadjidakis and Nikos Gatsos. It was titled \"Hartino to Fengaraki\" (\"Papermoon\") and was a part of the Greek production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in 1949, in which she starred as Blanche DuBois. The first official recording of this, now-legendary song was made by Nana Mouskouri in 1960, although the company Sirius, created by Manos Hadjidakis, issued, in 2004, a recording Melina had made for French television during the 1960s. Her recordings of \"Athenes, ma Ville\", a collaboration with Vangelis, and \"Melinaki\", were popular in France. Her recording of \"Feggari mou, Agapi mou\" (Phaedra) was quite popular and was later covered by Marinella in 1965.\n\nAt the time of the coup d'état in Greece by a group of colonels of the Greek military on 21 April 1967, she was in the United States, playing in \"Illya Darling\". She immediately joined the struggle against the Greek Military Junta and started an international campaign, travelling all over the world to inform the public and contribute to the isolation and fall of the colonels. As a result, the dictatorial regime revoked her Greek citizenship and confiscated her property.\n\nWhen her citizenship was taken away, she said: \"I was born a Greek and I will die a Greek. Mr. Pattakos (the then Minister of the Interior of the junta who made these decisions against her) was born a fascist and he will die a fascist\".\n\nWhile in London she worked with Amalia Fleming and Helen Vlachos of Kathimerini against the junta of the colonels.\n\nAfter the fall of the Junta and during the \"metapolitefsi\" in 1974, Mercouri settled in Greece and was one of the founding members of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), a centre-left political party. She was a member of the party's Central Committee and a rapporteur for the Culture Section, while being involved in the women's movement as well.\n\nIn the Greek legislative elections of 1974, she was a PASOK candidate in the Piraeus B constituency, but the 7,500 votes were not enough to secure a seat for her in the Hellenic Parliament (she needed 33 more votes), something that came true in the elections of 1977, in which she obtained the highest number of votes in the whole of Greece. \n\nWhen PASOK won the elections of 1981, Mercouri was appointed Minister for Culture of Greece, being the first female in that post. She would serve in that position for two terms until 1989, when PASOK lost the elections and New Democracy formed a cabinet. As Minister for Culture, Mercouri took advantage of her fame abroad and got in contact with great European leaders in order to promote Greece. She strongly advocated the return to Athens of the Parthenon Marbles, that were removed from Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis of Athens by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, and are now part of the British Museum collection in London. In anticipation of the return of the marbles, she held an international competition for the construction of the New Acropolis Museum, designated to display them and finally established in 2008.\n\nOne of her greatest achievements was the establishment of the institution of the European Capital of Culture within the framework of cultural policy of the European Union, that she had conceived and proposed in 1983, with Athens inaugurating this institution being the first title-holder in 1985, while she was a devoted supporter of the Athens bid to host the Centennial Olympic Games. In 1983, during the first Greek presidency of the Council of the European Union, Mercouri invited the Ministers for Culture of the other nine member states of the European Union at Zappeion, in order to increase the people's cultural awareness, since there was not any reference to cultural questions in the Treaty of Rome, which led to the establishment of formal sessions between the Ministers of Culture of the European Union. During the second presidency of Greece in 1988, she supported the cooperation between Eastern Europe and the European Union, which was finally implemented one year later with the celebration of the Month of Culture in Eastern countries. \n\nMercouri commissioned a study for the integration of all the archaeological sites of Athens to create a traffic-free archaeological park to promote the Greek culture. She introduced free access to museums and archaeological sites for Greek citizens, organized a series of exhibitions of Greek cultural heritage and modern Greek art worldwide, supported the restoration of buildings of special architectural interest and the completion of the Athens Concert Hall, backed the project of the Museum of Byzantine culture in Thessaloniki and established annual literary pizes. \n\nIn June 1986 Melina Mercouri spoke at the Oxford Union, a world-famous debating society, on the matter of the Parthenon Marbles and whether they should remain in London or be returned to Greece. She argued passionately for the Marble's reunification. As she explains, the Marbles are more to Greece than just works of art: they are an essential element of Greek heritage, which ties directly into cultural identity. She said: \"You must understand what the Parthenon Marbles mean to us. They are our pride. They are our sacrifices. They are our noblest symbol of excellence. They are a tribute to the democratic philosophy. They are our aspirations and our name. They are the essence of Greekness.\" Her stance on the matter has inspired a new wave of activism on the issue, and inspired pride in Greek culture and history.\n\nIn the legislative elections of November 1989, PASOK lost and Mercouri was elected a member of the Hellenic Parliament and remained a member of the party's Executive Bureau. In 1990, she was a candidate for Mayor of Athens but she was defeated by Antonis Tritsis.\n\nAfter PASOK's win in the election of 1993, she was back at the Ministry for Culture. Her major goals in this second term in office were: to create a cultural park in the Aegean Sea in order to protect and enhance the environment and civilization of the Aegean Islands, and to link culture with education at all education levels, introducing a system of post-training of teachers.\n\nMercouri died on 6 March 1994 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, from lung cancer. She was survived by her husband, Jules Dassin. She had no children. She received a state funeral with Prime Minister's honors at the First Cemetery of Athens four days later. The Melina Mercouri Foundation was founded by her widower.

The game released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and PlayStation 4 on February 21, 2017. A Version for Xbox One was released on December 13, 2017, while a version for the Nintendo Switch was released on February 1, 2018. Versions for iOS and Android will arrive in 2018. \"Night in the Woods\" is developed by Infinite Fall, a studio founded by game designer Alec Holowka, and animator/illustrator Scott Benson. Secret Lab, an Australian studio, built the game's narrative engine, and are creating the mobile version of the game using their sprite compression systems. \n\nIt is a story-focused exploration game in which players control a young woman named Mae, who recently dropped out of college and has returned to her hometown to find unexpected changes. The game was funded via the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, where it eventually earned over 400% of its funding goal.\n\nA companion game titled \"Longest Night\" was released in December 2013 by Holowka and Benson, along with co-writer Bethany Hockenberry. In December 2014, a second supplemental game was released, titled \"Lost Constellation\".\n\nAn extended version of the game, titled the \"Weird Autumn\" edition, was released for PC, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on December 13, 2017 and for Nintendo Switch on February 1, 2018. It features new content not seen in the original game, as well as the supplemental games. \"Night in the Woods\" received notable critical praise, mostly for its story, dialogue and characters.\n\nMae, an only child, has returned home to Possum Springs—a town populated by zoomorphic humans. Now living in her parents' attic, she discovers how much times have changed since the closing of the town's coal mines, uncovering a dark mystery that leads her into the nearby woods. She is forced to confront a horrible secret the town has hidden for decades involving not only the town's mine, but also the recent disappearance of her longtime friend Casey. Mae's friends also include Bea, a cigarette-smoking alligator and Mae's childhood friend; Gregg, a hyperactive fox; and his boyfriend, a bear named Angus. \"Paste\" describes the themes covered as \"mental illness, depression, the stagnancy of the middle and lower classes, and the slow death of small town America.\"\n\nAs Mae, players run, jump, and learn other mechanics that allow them to explore Possum Springs. Benson describes the key actions for the player as \"explore, converse, see and touch\", while Holowka describes their approach as \"narrative-focused\" rather than \"gameplay-first\". Players make decisions that affect the course of the story, though Benson has said, \"it's more like 'do you hang out with this person?' Okay, cool. That person might not know you as well by the end of the game, but this person you hung out with, you're going to get to see their storyline.\"\n\nMargaret \"Mae\" Borowski is a 20-year-old college dropout, who relocates back to her hometown of Possum Springs, which has been struck by the closure of the coal mines and the stagnating economy. She meets up with her old friends, including gloomy but intelligent Beatrice \"Bea\" Santello, hyperactive anarchist troublemaker Greggory \"Gregg\" Lee, and Gregg's quiet, modest boyfriend Angus Delaney. Mae also learns that another one of her old friends, Casey Hartley, has mysteriously disappeared.\n\nMae spends several days exploring Possum Springs and spending time with her friends, but she also begins to have strange and vivid dreams. At the town's Halloween festival, Mae witnesses a teenager being kidnapped by a mysterious figure. The four friends begin working together to figure out what is going on, with Mae's mental health slowly deteriorating with every one of her dreams. After intensive searching, the four stumble across a strange group of cloaked figures in the woods, who chase after them; Mae ends up falling and lapses into a coma.\n\nMae eventually wakes up and returns to her friends, and she reveals that the reason she dropped out was due to her increasing dissociation from people and the world (it is implied that Mae suffers from some sort of dissociative disorder), seeing everything as merely shapes. Mae's journal, in which she draws pictures for each major event in the game, was given to her by a doctor to write down her emotions after she bludgeoned a student with a softball bat six years ago as a result of a dissociative episode. Due to this incident, the townsfolk became wary of Mae and caused a financial and emotional strain in her family. As her dissociation worsened at college, Mae mustered up the strength to leave and return home, hoping that being back in Possum Springs would help her return to normal.\n\nStill wounded, Mae decides to venture out into the woods alone to find the group who chased her and the others, only for Gregg, Bea, and Angus to refuse to let her go by herself. The group enter the old mines and meet the mysterious group, who are revealed to be a cult. The cult turns out to be behind the kidnappings of several residents, including Casey, taking those whom they deem useless to society and whom they say will \"not be missed\" into the mines to sacrifice them to a god-like chthonic entity called the Black Goat in exchange for keeping the economy of Possum Springs afloat. The cult's leader allows the group to leave, threatening them never to tell anyone about the cult - however while riding up the mine's elevator, a member of the group attempts to kill Mae. The others manage to save her and the elevator falls, collapsing the mine and presumably trapping the cult underground.\n\nDepending on who the player interacted with the most throughout the course of the game, Mae will sit down with either Bea or Gregg and talk about the events of the previous night, and all the things that have happened in Possum Springs. The others join them shortly after, and Mae tells them that although they will all be forced to grow and adapt to life as it goes on for better and for worse, they can still enjoy their time together now. The game ends as the four decide to forget about their problems for the time being and have band practice.\n\n\"Night in the Woods\" was announced on October 22, 2013, on Kickstarter. Holowka and Benson set a funding goal, which was reached in only 26 hours. The project eventually earned over in crowdfunding. The additional funding allowed Infinite Fall to hire animator Charles Huettner to create additional animations, and for Infinite Ammo and game developer Adam Saltsman to create a roguelike that is playable within \"Night in the Woods\". While Benson believed adding further stretch goals would result in additional backers, Infinite Fall limited the amount of stretch goals to avoid scope creep. Benson names Chris Ware, Mike Mignola, Mary Blair, Flannery O’Connor, and Richard Scarry as influences on his work on \"Night in the Woods\".\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that the game would be ported to mobile devices by Secret Lab, with a tentative release set for 2018. In January 2018, the game was officially announced for the Nintendo Switch, and was released for the console the following month, including all content from the \"Weird Autumn\" edition.\n\nDeveloper Alec Holowka created the soundtrack for \"Night in the Woods\". Three albums of the game's music were released via Bandcamp on March 9, 2017. Holowka names DIIV as a large influence on the game's score.\n\n\"Night in the Woods\" received very favourable reviews. On Metacritic, the PS4 version has an average score of 87 from 15 critics and the PC version has an average score of 88 from 30 critics. Praise is mainly given to the writing and characters. In his review of both \"Night in the Woods\" and \"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands\", Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw of \"Zero Punctuation\" said that \"Night in the Woods\" somewhat reminded him of \"Gone Home\", \"'cos it eschews core gameplay in favor of storytelling; it takes a while to figure out what it's going for, and the supernatural horror stuff feels a bit at odds with the rest of the overall tone, but I respect the game for drawing a line under itself design-wise and not getting bogged down shoving in standard gameplay bullshit until it ultimately forgets to add anything new and the bullshit is all there is.\"\n\n\"Eurogamer\" ranked the game 13th on their list of the \"Top 50 Games of 2017\", and \"GamesRadar+\" ranked it 17th on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017, while \"Polygon\" ranked it 23rd on their list of the 50 best games of 2017. The game was nominated for \"Best Comedy Game\" in \"PC Gamer\"s 2017 Game of the Year Awards. It won the award for \"Best Adventure Game\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards, whereas its other nominations were for \"Best Art Direction\", \"Best Story\", and \"Best Original Music\". In Giant Bomb's 2017 Game of the Year Awards, the game won the award for \"Best Cast of Characters\", and was a runner-up each for \"Best Debut\", \"Best Story\", and \"Game of the Year\". It also won the award for \"Best Character\" (Mae) and \"Best Dialogue\" in \"Game Informer\"s 2017 Adventure Game of the Year Awards. Before that, the game won the award \"Best 2D Visuals\" and the overall award \"Golden Cube\" in the Unity Awards 2017, whereas it was nominated for \"Best Desktop/Console Game\".\n"}
{"id": "8539661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8539661", "title": "Ping pong show", "text": "Ping pong show\n\nA ping pong show is a form of stage entertainment that takes place in strip clubs. It is a type of sex show in which women use their pelvic muscles to either hold, eject, or blow objects from their vaginal cavity. Ping pong balls are the most iconic objects used. The show has been popular in Southeast Asia (particularly Bangkok, Thailand) for several decades, and is primarily performed for foreign tourists. The show is in many cases associated with sex tourism and human rights concerns have been raised regarding the performers.\n\nThe show typically takes place on a stage or dance platform and often involves a single performer. Usually she performs while lying on her back, although some variations involve a standing performer. The performer is commonly dressed in only a bikini top or bra and has her pubic hair shaved. Items can be inserted into the vagina either on stage as part of the performance or beforehand in preparation. As an alternative to ejecting the items using the pelvic muscles, objects are sometimes pulled out by hand. The earliest versions of the show involved ping pong balls, but other diverse objects have since been used in the performance. They include eggs, bananas, long strings or ribbons, whistles, horns, pens, cigarettes, candles, darts, spinning tops, bottles, firecrackers, razor blades, and chopsticks. Another activity is the shooting of goldfish into a bowl, or stuffing a large frog inside to see how long she can keep it in. A male member of the audience may be brought onto the dance platform to hold a balloon while a dart is shot at it, or the performer may do a shoot around the table at balloons tied to each customer's chair. Another example of audience participation involves the performer filling her vagina with beer, expelling it into a glass and inviting an audience member to drink it.\n\nThe popularity of ping pong shows in Thailand dates back to the early 1980s and a show is featured in the 1976 sexploitation film \"Emanuelle in Bangkok\". The shows are officially prohibited under the obscenity legislation of Thai law, and in 2004 the government further limited what is permitted. Nevertheless, demand from foreign tourists and local police corruption usually results in the practice being implicitly condoned by Thai officials. There are instances of women performing at ping pong shows also working as prostitutes, but in many ping pong show bars performers do not sell sex to customers. Although prostitution in Thailand is not strictly illegal, publicly soliciting and creating a nuisance is.\n\nLocations like Patpong in Bangkok, Walking Street, Pattaya, Bangla Road in Phuket and Ta Pae Gate in Chiang Mai have numerous venues hosting ping-pong shows. Customers are brought in by employees working for the ping-pong shows. They approach tourists and passers-by in streets such as Bangkok's Khaosan Road during the late evening and ask them if they want to see a show. They are frequently shown pictures of the show in a booklet. The shows take place on the upper floors of bars and strip clubs in locations such as Bangkok's entertainment district Patpong, while bikini-clad women dance in the ground floor bars. An entry fee is usually charged, often equivalent to around , though typically nearer in Bangkok. In some cases, instead of a cover charge, the drinks are priced 3–4 times higher than usual and a purchase is required. Other possible charges can include show fees and exit charges. In addition, performers often go around asking for tips after they have finished their acts.\n\nThe Laotian capital Vientiane was once famous for its brothels and \"ping-pong-show\" bars during the 1960s and 1970s as a result of the country's involvement in the Vietnam War. Travel writer Paul Theroux described a bar in 1973 Vientiane thus: “Your eyes get accustomed to the dark and you see the waitress is naked. Without warning she jumps on the chair, pokes a cigarette into her vagina and lights it, puffing it by contracting her uterine lungs.\" British journalist Christopher Robbins wrote that \"The White Rose\", a famous Vientiane bar during the war, featured floor shows in which women used their vaginas to smoke cigarettes and fling ping pong balls. Such shows have since disappeared and brothels are now prohibited by Laotian law.\n\nIn the red light district of De Wallen in Amsterdam the \"Moulin Rouge\" and \"Casa Rosso\" theatres feature on-stage sex shows including variations on the ping pong show.\n\nThe ping pong show is designed to get people talking about it so that people will come to the bar to see it. Often customers come only to see the show and leave when it is over. This is good business for the bar, which makes much of its profits from drinks. However, the majority of the bar workers do not participate in the show. Research published in 2002 indicated that most bar workers regard the show as bad for business and do not like it. Many bar workers consider the show to be low-class and in bad taste, boring as it is the same every night, and liable to take attention away from the bar workers by focussing on the acts. \n\nAn article in 2009 described an example of the working conditions of women at ping pong shows. The employees arrived at 18:00 and left at daybreak. They stamped a time card and were penalized 5 baht (US$0.14) for every minute they were late. Each month, they received two nights of leave and, if they did not miss any additional nights, they earned a salary of 6,000 baht (US$181), supplemented by tips. In 2015 the average monthly income in Thailand was $489, according to the International Labour Organization.\n\nSome human rights organizations (such as Not For Sale) have denounced ping pong shows as inherently misogynistic. Taina Bien-Aimé of Equality Now commented that: \"The attitude that [sex work in places like ping pong shows] is empowering gives a green light to traffickers. We're trying to fight the commercial sex trade, not empower the sex trade.\" Some of the performers in ping pong shows in Thailand come from poorer neighbouring countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia, or Laos. The closure of factories in Thailand during the Great Recession in the late 2000s led to an increase in unemployment in the country. Some women formerly engaged in factory work moved to Thailand's red-light districts and ended up working in ping pong shows. Bien-Aime commented: \"Working 14 hours [a day] in a factory or blowing ping pong balls out of your vagina should not be a person's only choices in life.\" Although no pain or suffering is generally experienced by female performers during the show, there have been rare accidents in which performers have been seriously and irreparably injured. The inclusion of a ping pong show scene in the film \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" led to the film being criticised on the grounds of sexism and racism.\n\n\n"}

The Egyptian National Police officially combats prostitution but, like almost all other countries, prostitution exists in Egypt. UNAIDS estimate there to be 23,000 prostitutes in the country, including Egyptians, Eastern Europeans, and of many other nationalities.\n\nProstitutes in Ancient Egypt were respected and even considered sacred as the first institutions where prostitution flourished were the temples of the Gods. The god Amun indulged in sexual activity with many women under a religious guise. Families often gave their most beautiful daughters to the priests of his temple. As soon as they grew too old for the tastes of the priests they were allowed to leave. Many practised prostitution until they were married.\n\nSome of the prostitutes wore blue faïence-beaded fishnet dresses, had red-painted lips and tattoos on their breasts or thighs.\n\nAs in the rest of the Roman Empire, prostitution was regulated. Prostitutes had to be registered and taxes were collected from them.\n\nProstitution was generally tolerated and taxed during this period, the rulers taking the view that prohibition would not stop prostitution and that tax revenue would be lost.\n\nThere were periods when prostitution was prohibited following pressure on the rulers from Muslim clerics.\n\nUnder Ottoman rule, the regulation and taxation of prostitutes continued. During the 17th century two guilds for prostitutes were set up.\n\nProstitution flourished following the French invasion of Egypt in 1798. The French organised additional prostitutes brought over from Europe. STIs spread rapidly through the brothels and this prompted the French authorities to introduce a law forbidding French troops from entering a brothel or having prostitutes in their rooms. Offenders received a death penalty.\n\nIn 1834 Muhammad Ali Pasha outlawed prostitution and female public dancing in Cairo. The prostitutes and dancers were sent to Upper Egypt, especially Kena, Esna and Aswan. In 1837 he extended this to all of Egypt.\n\nArticle 240 of the Mixed Penal Code of 1867 states: \"A pimp who incites young men or women below the age of 21 to evil practices leading to rape is to be punished by a period of imprisonment not less than one month and not more than one year\". Article 241 increases the penalty if the offence is committed by the father, mother or guardian of a minor.\n\nFollowing the abolition of slavery in 1877, many recently freed female slaves turned to prostitution to survive.\n\nAfter the British occupation of 1882, the authorities were concerned about disease spreading amongst the troops. They made legal provisions to control prostitution and introduced a system of healthcare. In July 1885 Egypt's Ministry of the Interior introduced regulations for the health inspection of prostitutes. Further regulations were introduced in 1896 to control brothels.\n\nAustralian soldiers stationed in Egypt in World War I including the famous half Chinese Australian sniper Billy Sing were major customers of Egyptian prostitutes in the local red light districts and brothels. High prices by the prostitutes led to the Wasser red light area becoming the scene of a major riot by New Zealand and Australian soldiers on Good Friday in 1915. The Australian military arranged for medical treament for venereal diseaes among its soldiers in Port Said and Cairo.\n\nIn 1932 a Cabinet decree abolished licences for prostitution and established the 'Public Morals Police'.\n\nA new penal code was introduced in 1937 and included a section to punish men who lived off the earnings of prostitutes.\n\nIn 1949 Military Order no. 76 was issued abolishing brothels.\n\nLaw No. 68, introduced in 1951, penalizing:\n\nThe prostitution system in Egypt often depends on pimping, although women also work alone. Pimps in Egypt organize the work of a group of prostitutes and receive a percentage of their profits. This is called the network in Egypt. This system is mainly used in Cairo and Alexandria and other big cities.\n\nNikah mut‘ah is a temporary marriage allowed under Shia Islam Law. The 'marriage' may last for a term of one hour to one year. It is sometimes used to circumvent the prostitution laws.\n\nWealthy men from the Gulf states often holiday in Egypt in the summer months. Whilst there they may take a young, temporary bride (often under-age) in a so-called \"summer marriage\". The marriages are arranged through a marriage broker and the girl's parents receive gifts and money as a 'dowry'. The marriage ends when the men return to their own country.\n\nAs prostitution is illegal in Egypt, no taxes are paid. The law exposes people who practice adultery to a jail sentence up to six months. For prostitution, the sentence is up to 3 years.\n\nEgypt is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Egyptian children are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Individuals from the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait purchase Egyptian women and girls for \"temporary\" or \"summer\" marriages for the purpose of commercial sex, including cases of sex trafficking; these arrangements are often facilitated by the victims' parents and marriage brokers, who profit from the transaction. Child sex tourism occurs primarily in Cairo, Alexandria, and Luxor.\n\nWomen and girls, including refugees and migrants, from Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East endure sex trafficking in Egypt. Syrian refugees who have settled in Egypt remain increasingly vulnerable to exploitation, including sex trafficking, and transactional marriages of girls—which can lead to sexual exploitation, including sex trafficking,\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Egypt as a 'Tier 2' country.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "324888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324888", "title": "Rational ignorance", "text": "Rational ignorance\n\nRational ignorance is refraining from acquiring knowledge when the cost of educating oneself on an issue exceeds the potential benefit that the knowledge would provide.\n\nIgnorance about an issue is said to be \"rational\" when the cost of educating oneself about the issue sufficiently to make an informed decision can outweigh any potential benefit one could reasonably expect to gain from that decision, and so it would be irrational to waste time doing so. This has consequences for the quality of decisions made by large numbers of people, such as in general elections, where the probability of any one vote changing the outcome is very small.\n\nThe term is most often found in economics, particularly public choice theory, but also used in other disciplines which study rationality and choice, including philosophy (epistemology) and game theory.\n\nThe term was coined by Anthony Downs in \"An Economic Theory of Democracy\".\n\nConsider an employer attempting to choose between two candidates offering to complete a task at the cost of $10/hour. The length of time needed to complete the task may be longer or shorter depending on the skill of the person performing the task, so it is in the employer's best interests to find the fastest worker possible. Assume that the cost of another day of interviewing the candidates is $100. If the employer had deduced from the interviews so far that both candidates would complete the task in somewhere between 195 and 205 hours, it would be in the employer's best interests to choose one or the other by some easily applied metric (for example, flipping a coin) rather than spend the $100 on determining the better candidate, saving at most $100 in labor.\n\nIn many cases, the decision may be made on the basis of heuristics; a simple decision model which may not be completely accurate. For example, in deciding which brand of prepared food is most nutritious, a shopper might simply choose the one with (for example) the lowest amount of sugar, rather than conducting a research study of all the positive and negative factors in nutrition.\n\nMarketers can take advantage of rational ignorance by increasing the complexity of a decision. If the difference in value between a quality product and a poor product is less than the cost to perform the research necessary to differentiate between them, then it is more rational for a consumer to just take his chances on whichever of the two is more convenient and available. Thus, it is in the interest of the producer of a lower value product to proliferate features, options, and package combinations which will tend to increase the number of shoppers who decide it's too much trouble to make an informed decision.\n\nPolitics and elections especially display the same dynamic. By increasing the number of issues that a person needs to consider to make a rational decision about candidates or policies, politicians and pundits encourage single-issue voting, party-line voting, jingoism, selling votes, or dart-throwing all of which may tip the playing field in favor of politicians who do not actually represent the electorate.\n\nThis does not mean that voters make poor and biased decisions: rather that in carrying out their everyday responsibilities (like working and taking care of a family), many people do not have the time to devote to researching every aspect of a candidate's policies. So many people find themselves making rational decisions meaning they let others who are more versed in the subject do the research and they form their opinion based on the evidence provided. They are being rationally ignorant not because they don't care but because they simply do not have the time.\n\nBecause the cost/benefit ratio increases with increasing costs or decreasing the benefit, the same effect can occur when politicians protect their policy decisions from the preferences of the public. To the degree that the electorate perceives their individual votes to count for less, they will have less incentive to spend any time actually learning any details about the candidate(s).\n\nA more nuanced example occurs when a voter identifies with a particular political party, akin to the adoption of a favorite movie critic. Based on prior experience a responsible voter will seek politicians or a political party that draws conclusions about social policy that are similar to what their own conclusions would have been had they done a complete analysis. But when voters find themselves agreeing with the same party or politician across a number of election cycles, many voters simply trust that the same will continue to be true and \"vote the ticket,\" also referred to as straight-ticket voting, instead of wasting time on a complete investigation.\n\nMuch of the empirical support for the idea of rational ignorance was drawn from studies of voter apathy, which reached particularly strong conclusions in the 1950s. However, apathy appeared to decline sharply in the 1960s as concern about issues such as the Vietnam War mounted, and political polarization increased. This is consistent with expectations from Public Choice Theory; as voters' interest in the results of policy decisions increase, the perceived benefit of the analysis (or the trip to the ballot box) increases, so more people will consider it rational to repair their ignorance.\n\nAdditionally, rational ignorance is scrutinized for its broadening effect on the decisions that individuals make in different matters. The investment of time and energy on learning about the specified subject has ramifications on other decision areas. Individuals sometimes ignore this when unconsciously assessing the investment cost versus payout. The external benefits of acquiring knowledge in one area—those benefits occurring in other decision areas—are therefore subject to being overlooked.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44237479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44237479", "title": "Robert Shallow", "text": "Robert Shallow\n\nRobert Shallow is a fictional character who appears in Shakespeare's plays \"Henry IV, Part 2\" and \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\". He is a wealthy landowner and Justice of the Peace in Gloucestershire, who at the time of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" is said to be over 80 (\"four score years and upward\").\n\nA thin, vain and often self-deluding individual, used to life in the provinces, Shallow functions as a dramatic foil to the rotund and worldly Sir John Falstaff, who visits Shallow's lands on royal business, but later returns intending to fleece Shallow of his money. In the \"Merry Wives\" he visits Windsor with his relative Slender, encountering Falstaff once more.\n\nIt has long been speculated that Shallow is a satire of Sir Thomas Lucy, a local landowner near Stratford-upon-Avon, with whom Shakespeare is said to have got into trouble as a young man. Other real-life models have also been proposed.\n\nIn \"Henry IV, Part 2\" Falstaff is commissioned to raise troops for the royal army to deal with a rebellion in the north. Shallow has been tasked to find suitable recruits in his locality. He tells his colleague Justice Silence that he looks forward to meeting Falstaff, who he hasn't seen for many years. He then reminisces about his youthful wild antics as a law student at Clement's Inn when Falstaff was a boy. When Falstaff arrives, Shallow is delighted by his witticisms, and invites him to stay longer.\n\nIn a soliloque after Shallow leaves, Falstaff tells the audience that Shallow's recollections of his supposedly wild student days are full of lies; that Shallow in those days was a skinny, feeble \"cheese paring\" of a man, noted only for his lechery. The local prostitutes called him \"mandrake\" because he looked like a \"forked radish\" when naked. But now he's wealthy, he's ripe for exploitation.\n\nAfter the defeat of the rebels, Falstaff visits Shallow, claiming that when the Prince becomes king, Falstaff will be in a position to give Shallow an important and remunerative post. He borrows £1000 from Shallow on this basis. The two get drunk and reminisce again. News arrives that the old king is dead, so they rush to London. When the new king rejects Falstaff, Shallow demands his money back. When it becomes obvious Falstaff can't pay him back, he says he'll settle for half, but Falstaff says that's not possible. Shallow is forced out of the king's presence along with the lowlife characters.\n\nShallow appears at the beginning of the play to complain that Falstaff has been poaching deer from his land, has broken into a lodge and has assaulted his servants. After Falstaff brazenly admits his actions, Shallow threatens to prosecute him, but Falstaff just dares him to try. Shallow's young cousin Abraham Slender adds that he was robbed by Falstaff's cronies Bardolph, Nym and Pistol: \"They carried me to the tavern and made me drunk, and afterward picked my pocket\". They all deny it in extravagant terms.\n\nShallow is advised to take his mind off the matter by promoting the marriage of Slender to Anne Page, daughter of the well-off Thomas Page, who approves the match. For most of the rest of the play, Shallow simply encourages the oafish Slender's clumsy attempts to woo Anne.\n\nG. Beiner argues Shallow's self-deceiving vanity provides a kind of \"comic justification\" for Falstaff's exploitation of him, since we feel more sympathy for \"clever knave than a foolish citizen\". In the \"Merry Wives\" Shallow is set up at the beginning as an impotent foil to the brazen and confident Falstaff, only to prepare the way for a reversal in which Falstaff himself is utterly outwitted and humiliated. Daniel Kornstein says that in \"Henry IV, Part 2\" Shallow is set up as the antithesis of the firm and incorruptible Lord Chief Justice, who is never deceived by Falstaff: the \"contrast between the Lord Chief Justice and Shallow could not be greater\". Shallow lives up to his name and is a \"stupid gullible liar\".\n\nCritics have noted that Shakespeare gives Shallow a distinct style of speech, characterised by constant repetition with slight variation. A.R. Humphries described it as \"babbling incoherence\". Thus in \"Henry IV, Part 2\" he says to Falstaff, \"I will not excuse you. You shall not be excused. Excuses shall not be admitted. There is no excuse shall serve. You shall not be excused.—\". Both the pathos and the comedy of the character derive from the contrast between the aged Shallow and the lusty, riotous figure he imagines himself to have been in his youth. Anthony Nuttall connects this to a much wider sense of the loss of a perhaps mythical ideal past that runs through the Henriad plays.\n\nIt has been speculated that Shallow, at least as portrayed in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", is a parody of Sir Thomas Lucy, a local landowner in Charlecote, near Stratford upon Avon, with whom Shakespeare is supposed to have had conflicts when he was young. Nicholas Rowe records a story that the young Shakespeare was prosecuted for poaching deer from Lucy's land. This corresponds to the accusation Shallow makes against Falstaff, but finds himself unable to follow up. The play also appears to contain a pun on the name \"Lucy\", similar to a ballad that circulated in Stratford, in which Lucy's name was altered to \"lousy\". When Shallow and his dim-witted relative Slender discuss their family coat of arms, they mention that it depicted \"luces\" (pike). Their family symbols unintentionally become literally lice-ridden when this is misinterpreted as a \"dozen white louses\". Thomas Lucy's coat of arms contained \"luces\".\n\nThe theory that Shallow was a joke at Lucy's expense dates back to c.1688, when Archdeacon Richard Davies wrote that Shakespeare was \"much given to all unluckiness in stealing venison and Rabbits particularly from Sr. Lucy. . . his revenge is so great that he [Lucy] is his Justice Clodpate, and calls him a great man and that in allusion to his name bore three louses rampant for his Arms\".\n\nLeslie Hotson in his 1931 book \"Shakespeare versus Shallow\" argues that Shallow is a parody of William Gardiner (1531–97), a corrupt Justice of the Peace who had a long-running feud with the owner of the Swan theatre, Francis Langley. Shakespeare had been drawn into this feud and had even had a writ of attachment, a form of restraining order, taken out against him by Gardiner's stepson. Hotson argues that the joke about the \"luces\" in Shallow's coat of arms refers to Gardiner's wife, Frances Luce, whose family coat of arms bearing luces was incorporated into Gardiner's. Hotson says, \"Could this be the true significance of the coat of arms passage in the Merry Wives? Was the Justice Shallow of the play a caricature of Justice Gardiner?\" Hotson proceeds to argue that most of Shallow's actions in the plays satirise corrupt deals in which Gardiner was involved, and that the dim-witted Slender is a parody of Gardiner's stepson, William Wayte, who was mercilessly exploited by Gardiner.\n\nOther critics have argued that Shallow comes from a long theatrical tradition of depicting bumbling old men, derived ultimately from the Roman stock character of the senex amans. Samuel Schoenbaum says that a direct parody of Lucy is unlikely. Why should Shakespeare risk offending \"well placed friends of a man who had done the state some service\"? The fact that the evidence for the alleged parody of Lucy is confined to the \"Merry Wives\" suggests that the character was not invented as parody of Lucy, though Shakespeare may have remembered the luces/louses joke from his Stratford days. Certainly \"Lucy was, in physical form, social condition and personality, nothing like Shallow\". Nevertheless, even if the character of Shallow in \"Henry IV, Part 2\" was not invented as a parody of either Lucy or Gardiner, it may have been adapted in the \"Merry Wives\" to become one. Peter Quennell argues that the portrayal of Shallow probably drew on both Lucy and Gardiner.\n\nShallow appears along with Falstaff's other cronies in the play \"Falstaff's Wedding\" (1766), a comedy by William Kenrick, which is set in the period between the end of \"Henry IV, Part 2\" and the beginning of \"Henry V\". A subplot involves Mistress Quickly and Doll Tearsheet disguising themselves as gentlewomen to find rich husbands, targeting Shallow and Slender. Quickly intends to marry Shallow, and Doll to marry Slender. The plan appears to succeed, but Shallow and Slender find out their true identities and switch places at the weddings with Ancient Pistol and Corporal Nym, so Quickly ends up married to Pistol and Doll is married to Nym.\n\nJames White's book \"Falstaff's Letters\" purports to be letters written by Falstaff and his friends. It includes an affidavit deposited before Shallow about Falstaff's misdeeds, and letters between him and his servant Davy.\n"}
{"id": "25462060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25462060", "title": "Royal Hanneford Circus", "text": "Royal Hanneford Circus\n\nThe Royal Hanneford Circus is an American-based touring family circus. With origins dating back to 1690, it has been called the oldest circus in the world. The family first performed as a traveling troupe in 1807. In 1903, the family began its own circus as the \"Hanneford Royal Canadian Circus\" and in their early seasons toured the British Isles and Continental Europe. The family performed separately throughout much of the early 20th century in the United States. The modern Royal Hanneford Circus was formed in 1965, when Tommy Hanneford began producing shows featuring the family.\n\nAccounts of the early origins of the Hanneford family performances conflict. Some accounts claim that the Hanneford family began performing as early as 1690, when the Irish-born Michael Hanneford entertained royalty with bareback riding, acrobatics, and juggling. The family themselves claim their oldest involvement with the circus involved Edwin Hanneford, a juggler from London. In 1778, Edwin was summoned by King George III to compete against Walter Scott to determine the best juggler in England. However, during the competition, King George became too preoccupied with other issues and did not declare a winner.\n\nThe Hanneford family first traveled as a troupe in 1807. Successive generations of the family were involved in performances as well. By 1903, the family had their own circus production, the Hanneford Royal Canadian Circus. They performed under a canvas tent and traveled to cities and villages in the British Isles via horse-drawn wagons. During the winter months they performed with other acts indoors throughout Europe. In 1915 the family was performing in Spain while John Ringling of the Ringling Brothers Circus was in attendance. After seeing the production, Ringling wanted to bring the family to perform in the United States. In order to do so, Ringling purchased the entire circus. At that time, the family consisted of George Hanneford Sr. and his wife Catherine, Edwin \"Poodles\", George, Grace, and Elizabeth.\n\nEdwin \"Poodles\" Hanneford is considered amongst the greatest trick riders in history. He was the first to perform a somersault from one running horse to another. Additionally, Poodles held a Guinness Book of World Records record for performing a running jump onto a horse and stepping off 26 times in a row. Poodles appeared in over 40 films. He retired in 1954, died in 1967, and was enshrined in the International Circus Hall of Fame in 1968.\nUpon coming to the United States, the Hannefords performed with various acts. The family's first credited appearance in American film is \"When I Grow Up\", released in 1951.\n\nThe next patriarch after Poodles was Tommy Hanneford, son of George Sr. and nephew of Poodles, who began performing as a clown in 1933 when he was five years old. He was called \"The Funniest Man on Horseback\" for his comic equestrian performances. He performed from the 1930s through the 1960s, except for a period beginning in 1946 when he served in the United States Army. Besides his circus performances he appeared on television, in films, and at most major Shrine circuses throughout the United States. The family was considered reunited in 1965 at Pleasure Island Park in Wakefield, Massachusetts. Tommy organized the performance that featured his sister Kay with a dog act, his wife Struppi on a high wire, and was called the Hanneford Family Circus. Tommy later incorporated the act in Macon, Georgia and it became the first time the family had owned their own circus since his father George Sr.\n\nThe family's first major production was in September 1966 in Saginaw, Michigan. Tommy's brother George Jr. was featured in a bareback riding act. The performance is considered the first of the \"Royal Hanneford Circus\". In 1968, Tommy joined producer Bill English, and in 1969 the two men were joined by Art Concello, formerly general manager of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. The three men operated Circus Classics, Inc. until they separated in 1974. In 1975, Tommy reorganized the Royal Hanneford Circus.\n\nGeorge Sr. Hanneford was inducted into the Circus Hall of Fame in 1977, his wife Catherine in 1990, and Tommy posthumously in 2008, following his death in 2005. Tommy's wife Struppi was inducted into the Circus Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nIn 1989, the Royal Hanneford Circus began performing at the Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop, performing every day of the week save for Tuesdays. Following the death of Tommy, his brother George Jr. and sister Catherine assumed control of the circus. In 1993, the Swap Shop owner Preston Henn had been sued over injury to a circus performer, leading him to require the circus to provide worker's compensation insurance to its employees. In July 2006, the circus was evicted from the Swap Shop for violating that agreement.\n\nPrior to the eviction, the circus employed about a dozen performers and owned nine animals. The use of animals in the Hannefords' circus acts at the Swap Shop attracted the attention of animal rights activists, including the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida (ARFF), which had long accused the circus of animal cruelty. However, George Jr.'s son, George Hanneford III, denied these claims, as well as rebuffed an offer from ARFF to adopt and relocate the animals.\n\n"}
{"id": "23740059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23740059", "title": "Sarrasani", "text": "Sarrasani\n\nSarrasani is a German circus that reached world fame before World War II and was resident in Dresden, but also became known as the national circus of Argentina during the years of German separation.\n\nSarrasani was founded by \"Hans Stosch\", a clown with the stage name \"Giovanni Sarrasani\", who was born 1873 in Poznań. Stosch came 1901 to Radebeul near Dresden and the circus had its official premiere 1902 in Meißen. In the year 1912 a stationary circus building opened, which was designed by Max Littmann for Sarrasani. The circus often performed abroad and reached world fame. Its well-known labels were the elephants, but the circus was also known for the Sioux, who were employed from the early years.\n\nFrom 1923 to 1925 Sarrasani went on its first tour through South America. In these years, Stosch-Sarrasani also introduced innovative marketing concepts and wrote fictive adventure stories \"Fahrten und Abenteuer\", \"Mit Sarrasani in Südamerika\". Totally, about 10 million copies of these booklets were distributed. \n\nAfter the death of Hans Stosch-Sarrasani Sr., his son Hans Stosch-Sarrasani Jr. took directorship. He was followed by his widow, Trude Stosch-Sarrasani, in 1941. The Sarrasani theater was destroyed on 13 February 1945 during the Bombing of Dresden in World War II. Trude Stosch-Sarrasani emigrated to Argentina, where she reestablished the circus in Buenos Aires as the \"Circo Nacional Argentino.\"\n\nThe story has two basic topics. On one side, a tale about a family of circus directors struggling to remain at the top of show business in the social context of Europe and South-America during the last century. On the other side, the epical facts of a colossal enterprise that survived the most transcendental political crisis, dealing – voluntarily or by force – with political leaders, dictators, bankers or businessmen from both continents.\n\nThe Sarrasani Circus was founded in 1901, reaching a patrimony of 400 animals (not pets, precisely) and hiring a similar number of artists and technicians, hosting troupes from the most distant and exotic places: Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Moroccan, Hindus, Sioux, Ethiopians, Gauchos, Europeans, etc. Within this complex megalopolis, the Circus managed to sail through turbulent periods of this century emerging unharmed. Among them: World War I, the 1930s crisis, the Nazism, World War II, Joseph Stalin's troops arriving to Eastern Germany, the zenith of Peronism in Argentina and several coups d'état in different countries. During the second Peronist period in Argentina the circus even changed its name to \"National Circus of Argentina\". Only since Germany’s re-unification, Sarrasani's name was exalted again after almost a 50 year of proscription. The story is conceived as a road movie where the odyssey of an immense circus, a sort of Noah's Arc of people and animals, is an excuse to travel across two continents in different periods of the last century. A journey in space and time, this chronicle carries its own background of tango, epochal songs and circus orchestras.\n\nBesides the profuse network of historic characters, the tale focuses on three main personalities that were in charge of the circus at different times: Hans Stosch-Sarrasani, alias Senior, Hans Stosch-Sarrasani (son), alias Junior, and Trude, Junior's young wife.\n\nSenior, the founder, was a dreamer, a visionary in show-biz obsessed with the idea of greatness, a megalomaniac who only conceived pharaonic projects that, incredibly, worked. His circus turned out to be a crossroad of cultures from all around the five continents and also the state-of-the-art in technology.\n\nSarranni based his circus in Dresden and it reached a height of popularity there in the late 1920's. At around the same time, the Karl May Museum opened nearby.\n\nHe toured not only around Europe, but also around South America, where he also moved the zoo and all that megalopolis on three enormous ships. Due to his stubborn and independent character, he had several problems with bureaucrats in power and especially with the ascendant Nazi regime that pushed him to emigrate. He established the circus in 1901 and ran it until his death in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1934.\n\nJunior, his son, inherited the great name but also a chaotic financial situation and, even worse, an awful relation with the political authorities of his country. He didn’t make big aesthetic changes on the scene but his pragmatic administration and a great sense of reality allowed the circus to cope with the worse crisis since its foundation. He had a special talent for diplomatic treatment with leaders in every country he arrived; he arranged with Joseph Goebbels the return of the circus to Germany for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Junior would run the circus during seven years from 1934 to 1941.\n\nTrude, Junior's wife, a lovely and angelic young woman, found herself in charge of the circus aged only 28 years, during the Nazi regime. Her approach to running it was notoriously different from her male predecessors: she never commanded or ordered; on the contrary, she always delicately suggested. Minister Goebbels recommended the use of her young and beautiful figure in the circus posters as an icon of the Arian era. In 1944, however, she was sent to prison accused of anti-Germanic behavior. Two weeks later, Trude was released to continue performing, while Germany was immersed in the open war. Her partner, the Hungarian acrobat Gabor Némedy, was kept prisoner as a way of persuasion. In 1945, during the show, she was caught in the bombing of Dresden, from which she fortunately emerged alive. \n\nAfter the war, she started over as an equestrian artist working for other circus. In 1948, an Argentine producer invited her to reestablish Sarrasani in Buenos Aires with the presence of President Juan Perón and his wife, Evita, and began a very close relationship with them. Trude ran the circus until the mid seventies, albeit as a smaller enterprise. The popularity of cinema and TV, together with new cultural codes for animal care and use, led the circus to adapt to modern times.\n\nTrude Stosch-Sarrasani spent her last days in San Clemente del Tuyú (a seaside resort town south of Buenos Aires) with Kiki, a little dog picked up from the street. Ms. Stosch-Sarrasani died there on June 6, 2009, at the age of 96.\n\n\n"}

The album features guest appearances from Droop-E, Work Dirty, Young Dro, Chris Brown, Spodee, NHT Boyz, T.I., King Harris, Cousin Fik, Choose Up Cheese, J. Stalin, Bosko, Webbie, Ty Dolla Sign, and Mike Marshall.\n\nOn October 1, 2012, E-40 announced the release of \"The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil\" 4, 5 and 6 for March 26, 2013. On June 12, 2013, the album covers were revealed for \"The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil\" 4, 5 and 6. In June 2013, E-40 explained why he was releasing three album's in one day, saying: \"I’m a score and a nickel deep in the game! That’s 25 years with real studio albums on the shelf. If an artist can release two and three mixtapes a year for free, I can release two or three official studio albums a year for money. As an independent artist I do what I want, not what I can. I’m putting out three albums because I’ve got 3 decades of fans that I gotta satisfy. I’ve been through hella different eras of music and I survived successfully! It took William Shakespeare 20 years of experience to write Hamlet! I make Slaps and paint pictures with my raps and I’m in my prime with 25 years of experience. You ain’t gotta like me but you gotta respect me!\" In a December 2013, interview with HipHopDX, E-40 spoke about the direction he went on the album, saying: \"I just wanna keep it right in the pocket of what they been listening to with a new school twist, but keep the old school twist too. You feel me? So I want to make sure it's the right recipe. The right... When you dip your finger in that sauce, the seasoning is perfect.\" In the same interview he spoke about how he decided who he would collaborate with on the album, saying: \"You know, a lot of times, we get the beats early. The beat is always first. Us as artists, we like, \"This the perfect beat. Do you know who would sound good on here? Big K.R.I.T. and Z-Ro.\" And I rock with 'em. I got love for 'em, so let's see if they can get on this with me, and that's how it all unfolds.\"\n\nIn a December 2013, interview with \"XXL\", E-40 spoke about the process of recording three albums, saying: \"I’m not going to lie, this one was tough to do. To come back with 4, 5 and 6, three albums, it comes to a point where I can do one album standing on my head, easy. I’d probably have it done within three weeks or a month the way I work. \"The Block Brochure\" 4, 5 and 6, it was a trip because I did over a hundred songs and I shaved it all the way down to 42 songs. But I shaved it down because I wanted every song to poke out like nipples. And that’s what it’s doing. Just throw it in and just ride, just have a good time.\"\n\nHe went on to discuss how long it took to record, saying: \"You know, guest appearances help a lot. When you do a song with other artists—’cause everybody wants to hear another artist with their favorite artist—one thing you got make sure is when you take that first verse and that second verse, you got to be a part of the whole song. Whether you on the hook on there talking or repeating the ad-libs, that’s one thing I learned to do over the years. Now just imagine, from March 2010 I dropped \"Revenue Retrievin’: Day Shift\" and \"Night Shift\". Here it is, December 2013. Within that amount of time—just to show you my work progress—within that amount of time I dropped 10 solos and two duos, with me and Too $hort. So that’s 12 albums [from] March 2010 to now when \"The Block Brochure\" 4, 5, and 6 comes out. That’s three and a half years.\"\n\nHe also spoke about the deadline for the release date, saying: \"You know what’s the trip about it? At the end, I was trying to reach deadline, [and] then I said fuck that, we coming out December 10. Then I finally got stressed out after things was done. Ain’t that a trip? Neck got tight and shit. I’m like, it’s done, it’s turned in, I got my release date. I got my album done and all the covers. Everything is in promotions. But I guess it just caught up with me. But I’m back.\"\n\nHe also spoke about some of the features on the album, saying: \"I try to do collaborations that a lot of people don’t do. When it’s already predictable it’s not so much of a special song. I got a song with me, Big K.R.I.T. and Z-Ro [\"In Dat Cup\"]; me, T.I., and Chris Brown [\"Episode\"]. I never did a song with T.I., I always had love for him. We both had mutual respect for each other but never did one. Never did a song with Chris Brown singing. We did a rap song remix with him with “Function” [and] he killed it, that’s a great song too. My son Droop-E and Work Dirty, first of all they [on] Sick Wid’ It Records—my label—and they also family and always in the studio with me. Decades produced the beat, he family too. That was just one of those moments where it’s, “Lets come with it.” My boy Stressmatic came with the hook, “Yellow Gold.” Soon as he did the hook we was on the case. But that’s what it’s about, doing songs with people like me, Danny Brown and ScHoolboy Q [\"All My Niggas\"]. Three unique different styles, unorthodox, different voices, doing what everybody else don’t.\"\n\nOn October 22, 2013, the album's first single \"Episode\" featuring T.I. and Chris Brown was released. On December 17, 2013, the music video was released for \"Thirsty\" featuring King Harris. On January 24, 2014, the music video was released for \"Episode\" featuring T.I. and Chris Brown. On February 3, 2014, the music video was released for \"Chitty Bang\" featuring Juicy J and Ty Dolla Sign. On June 23, 2014, the music video was released for \"Bamboo\".\n\n\"The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 4\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Ronald Grant of HipHopDX gave the album three out of five stars, saying \"All in all, E-40 has built an entire career out of Hip Hop that’s relatable, yet adventurous, playful and entertainingly repetitious. \"The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil\" Parts 4, 5, & 6 continues in that tradition. While it’s a lot to ask of today’s stunted attention spans and isn’t without lapses, \"The Block Brochure\" proves that E-40 is still more ahead of the curve at crafting imaginative Hip Hop music than many new artists can ever hope to be.\" David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying \"What makes Pt. 4 unique is that it is low on star power, and yet it features a fine selection of solo E-40 tracks along with some lesser-known features that surprise. Biggest surprise has to be Cousin Fik and Choose Up Cheese on \"Tree in the Load,\" with the NhT Boyz and the infectious \"Thirsty\" running a close second. The rest of the highlights come from radio-friendly folks like Juicy J (\"Chitty Bang\"), T.I. (\"Episode\"), and Webbie (\"By Any Means\"), all in charge of hooky club cuts.\"\n"}
{"id": "1138011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1138011", "title": "The Society of the Spectacle", "text": "The Society of the Spectacle\n\nThe Society of the Spectacle () is a 1967 work of philosophy and Marxist critical theory by Guy Debord, in which the author develops and presents the concept of the Spectacle. The book is considered a seminal text for the Situationist movement. Debord published a follow-up book \"Comments on the Society of the Spectacle\" in 1988.\n\nThe work is a series of 221 short theses in the form of aphorisms. Each thesis contains one paragraph.\n\nDebord traces the development of a modern society in which authentic social life has been replaced with its representation: \"All that once was directly lived has become mere representation.\" Debord argues that the history of social life can be understood as \"the decline of \"being\" into \"having\", and \"having\" into merely \"appearing\".\" This condition, according to Debord, is the \"historical moment at which the commodity completes its colonization of social life.\"\n\nThe spectacle is the inverted image of society in which relations between commodities have supplanted relations between people, in which \"passive identification with the spectacle supplants genuine activity\". \"The spectacle is not a collection of images,\" Debord writes, \"rather, it is a social relation among people, mediated by images.\"\n\nIn his analysis of the spectacular society, Debord notes that the quality of life is impoverished, with such a lack of authenticity that human perceptions are affected, and an attendant degradation of knowledge, which in turn hinders critical thought. Debord analyzes the use of knowledge to assuage reality: the spectacle obfuscates the past, imploding it with the future into an undifferentiated mass, a type of never-ending present; in this way the spectacle prevents individuals from realizing that the society of spectacle is only a moment in history, one that can be overturned through revolution.\n\nDebord's aim and proposal is \"to wake up the spectator who has been drugged by spectacular images...through radical action in the form of the construction of situations...situations that bring a revolutionary reordering of life, politics, and art\". In the Situationist view, situations are actively created moments characterized by \"a sense of self-consciousness of existence within a particular environment or ambience\".\n\nDebord encouraged the use of détournement, \"which involves using spectacular images and language to disrupt the flow of the spectacle.\"\n\n\"The Society of the Spectacle\" is a critique of contemporary consumer culture and commodity fetishism, dealing with issues such as class alienation, cultural homogenization, and mass media.\n\nWhen Debord says that \"All that was once directly lived has become mere representation,\" he is referring to the central importance of the image in contemporary society. Images, Debord says, have supplanted genuine human interaction.\n\nThus, Debord's fourth thesis is: \"The spectacle is not a collection of images; rather, it is a social relationship between people that is mediated by images.\"\n\nIn a consumer society, social life is not about living, but about having; the spectacle uses the image to convey what people need and must have. Consequently, social life moves further, leaving a state of \"having\" and proceeding into a state of \"appearing\"; namely the appearance of the image.\n\n\"In a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a moment of the false.\"\n\nDebord also draws an equivalence between the role of mass media marketing in the present and the role of religions in the past. The spread of commodity-images by the mass media, produces \"waves of enthusiasm for a given product\" resulting in \"moments of fervent exaltation similar to the ecstasies of the convulsions and miracles of the old religious fetishism\".\n\nDebord contends further that \"the remains of religion and of the family (the principal relic of the heritage of class power) and the moral repression they assure, merge whenever the enjoyment of this world is affirmed–this world being nothing other than repressive pseudo-enjoyment.\" \"The monotheistic religions were a compromise between myth and history, ... These religions arose on the soil of history, and established themselves there. But there they still preserve themselves in radical opposition to history.\" Debord defines them as \"Semi-historical religion\". \"The growth of knowledge about society, which includes the understanding of history as the heart of culture, derives from itself an irreversible knowledge, which is expressed by the destruction of God.\"\n\nIn Chapter 8, \"Negation and Consumption Within Culture\", Debord includes a critical analysis of the works of three American sociologists. Debord discusses at length Daniel J. Boorstin's \"The Image\" (1961), arguing that Boorstin missed the concept of Spectacle. In thesis 192, Debord mentions some American sociologists who have described the general project of developed capitalism which \"aims to recapture the fragmented worker as a personality well integrated in the group;\" the examples mentioned by Debord are David Riesman, author of \"The Lonely Crowd\" (1950), and William H. Whyte, author of the 1956 bestseller \"The Organization Man\". Among the 1950s sociologists who are usually compared to Riesman and Whyte, is C. Wright Mills, author of \"\". Riesman's \"Lonely Crowd\" term is also used in thesis 28.\n\nBecause the notion of the spectacle involves real life being replaced by representations of real life, \"Society of the Spectacle\" is also concerned with the notion of authenticity versus inauthenticity, a theme which is revisited in Chapter 8, \"Negation and Consumption within Culture\". In Debord's treatment, modern society forces culture to constantly re-appropriate or re-invent itself, copying and re-packaging old ideas. Thesis 207 makes this point, rhetorically:\n\n\"Ideas improve. The meaning of words participates in the improvement. Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it. It embraces an author's phrase, makes use of his expressions, erases a false idea, and replaces it with the right idea.\"\n\nThis passage concerning plagiarism is itself directly lifted from \"Poésies\", a minor work of literary criticism by French-Uruguayan author Isidore Lucien Ducasse, better known as the Comte de Lautréamont. In particular, the original French text for both Debord and Lautréamont's versions of the passage are identical: \"Les idées s'améliorent. Le sens des mots y participe. Le plagiat est nécessaire. Le progrès l'implique. Il serre de près la phrase d'un auteur, se sert de ses expressions, efface une idée fausse, la remplace par l'idée juste.\"\n\n\nThe book cover of the 1983 edition is derived from a photograph by the \"Life\" magazine photographer, J. R. Eyerman. On November 26, 1952, at the Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California), the premiere screening of the film \"Bwana Devil\" by Arch Oboler took place as the first full-length, color 3-D (aka 'Natural Vision') motion picture. Eyerman took a series of photographs of the audience wearing 3-D glasses.\n\n\"Life\" magazine used one of the photographs as the cover of a brochure about the 1946-1955 decade. The photograph employed in the Black and Red edition shows the audience in \"a virtually trance-like state of absorption, their faces grim, their lips pursed;\" however, in the one chosen by \"Life\", \"the spectators are laughing, their expressions of hilarity conveying the pleasure of an uproarious, active spectatorship.\" The Black and Red version also is flipped left to right, and cropped. Despite widespread association among English-speaking readers, Debord had nothing to do with this cover illustration, which was chosen by Black and Red.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a strategy game for two players. One player, who plays the tiger, has only one piece. The other player has 18 men. The tiger must eat the men, who must block the tiger so that he cannot move. The game can be played with any kind of pieces that can be distinguished from one another. The board is 8×8 squares, with the addition of a square of 2×2 squares, which is called the tiger’s lair.\nThe men cannot take the tiger, but can only block him. The Tiger, by jumping over a man, can take it, in which case the man is removed from play. The men must stay together 2 by 2 to block the tiger. In general, if a tiger eats more than three pieces, it is unlikely that men will have enough pieces to win the game. If the men do not make mistakes, but move cautiously, victory is likely.\n\n"}

He made his comic debut in New York City that year. After this debut—held at the Theatre Comique, on 6 April 1868—Lingard became known as one of the funniest men of the time. He continued his career in New York, and later became manager of Wood's Theatre there.\n\nLingard often appeared on stage in drag, in the high fashion style of the era. Additionally, he mastered the art of quick change, eventually becoming able to act the part of six characters, with only a few seconds for each costume change.\n\nLingard is chiefly remembered for the well-known vaudeville song, \"Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines\", sometimes shortened to simply \"Captain Jinks.\" Lingard wrote the lyrics, and the music is attributed to T. Maclagan. It was a popular song of the 19th century, and is still sung to this day, having entered the country-western and bluegrass repertory. The song later became the basis of a stage comedy of the same title, written by Clyde Fitch, and a 1975 opera by Jack Beeson. The song has various rendetions.\n\n"}

It was announced on September 5, 2008 via the company's discussion board, and officially released via the App Store on February 24, 2009, and via Ovi Store on June 16, 2010. A port to Android was announced as part of the Humble Bundle for Android 2 on March 19, 2012. The game has received press attention for its unique gameplay. A lite version of the game was also released for free which featured 2 levels of the game.\n\nThe goal of the game is to paint various objects. In each level the player is given an object with an attached rope which varies in length depending on the level. Using a mouse or touch screen and tilt controls, the player attempts to wrap the object with the rope. Each time the rope is laid down on the object, the area near the rope gets covered by paint. The challenge is getting the required percentage of an object painted with only a finite length of rope. There are three targets in each level - minimum, medium and maximum coverage.\n\nSome levels require nails protruding from the objects to be entwined in rope rather than having to cover the object's surface.\n\n5th IMGAwards (International Mobile Gaming Awards) (2008): Excellence in 3D\n\nThe game was extremely well received in the reviews upon its release. Following are the review scores by some of the websites:\nPocketGamer: 10/10 (Platinum Award)\nIGN: 9.5/10\nSlideToPlay: 4/4\n\nFor a time the game was the highest rated on Gamerankings.com (with a score of 97.86%), before being overtaken by \"Grand Theft Auto V\" in 2014.\n\n"}
