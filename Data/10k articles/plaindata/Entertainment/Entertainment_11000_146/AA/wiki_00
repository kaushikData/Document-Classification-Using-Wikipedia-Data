Arabsat was created to deliver satellite-based, public and private telecommunications services to the Arab States, in accordance with International Standards. With 21 member countries, the organization plays a vital role of enhancing communications in the Arab World.\n\nThe Arabsat satellites are a series of geostationary communications satellites launched from 1985 through 2011. Some of the later satellites in the series remain operational in orbit, while others have been retired and are .\n\nThe foundation of Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Arabsat) dates from the late 1960s. In 1967, information ministers of Arab states developed a series of principles in relation to a satellite network, to create an integration of social and cultural activities among the Arab League countries. On the other hand, the Arab States Broadcasting Union (ASBU) was established in 1969. Saudi Arabia did not join this Egypt-led and Cairo-based union until 1974, most probably due to the tense relationship between Saudi Arabia and Egypt at the time.\n\nOn 14 April 1976, Arabsat was formed under Arab League jurisdiction with the goal of serving the information, cultural and educational needs of its member states. Saudi Arabia was the main financier of the new organization due to its expanded financial resources as a result of its flourishing oil-exporting industry. Riyadh housed Arabsat's headquarters.\n\nThe first launch Arabsat-1A was performed by a French Ariane rocket. The American Space Shuttle \"Discovery\" launched Arabsat's second satellite, Arabsat-1B, in 1985. Arabsat-1A and -1B were switched off in 1992 and 1993, respectively.\n\nAll Arab League states except for Comoros are shareholders of Arabsat:\n\nArabsat-1 was the model designator for a series of first-generation satellites built by an international team led by Aérospatiale of France. It is a satellite with three-axis stabilized Spacebus 100 spacecraft with two deployable solar array wings, making it almost 68 ft (20.7 m) long and over 18 ft (5.5 m) wide when deployed in orbit. It weighs about 2,800 lb (1,270 kg) in its initial orbit, but some 1,490 lb (675 kg) of this is propellant. It has an onboard low-thrust motor that utilizes hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, and transfers from an initial elliptical to geosynchronous orbit by firing this motor. The remaining propellant is then used for station-keeping or moving over the life of the satellite.\n\nArabsat-1A, the first Arabsat satellite, was launched by Ariane on 8 February 1985. Shortly after launch it suffered a solar panel extension malfunction. Coupled with other failures, the satellite was soon relegated to backup status until it was abandoned completely in late 1991.\n\nArabsat-1B, the second flight model, was deployed in June 1985, from the Space Shuttle \"Discovery\" on mission STS-51-G, and placed into service near 26° East, and remained in operation until mid-1992.\n\nArabsat-1C the third satellite of the series, was launched by Ariane on 26 February 1992, as a stop-gap measure to maintain network services until the Arabsat second generation spacecraft became available.\n\nArabsat-1D was renamed from the Anik-D2 (a Hughes HS-376 bus originally carrying 24 active C-band transponders).\n\nBy the end of 1994, the Arabsat system had been reduced to only one operational satellite. A contract for two Arabsat second-generation satellites was signed with Aérospatiale in April 1993, to build several additional comsats based on the Spacebus 3000A platform.\n\nArabsat-2A, was launched on 9 July 1996.\n\nArabsat-2B, was launched on 13 November 1996.\n\nArabsat-2C was leased from PAS-5 in May 2002 and moved from the Western Hemisphere during November 2002 to a position at 26° E.\n\nArabsat-2D was leased from Hotbird 5 and moved from the position 13° E during November 2002 to a position at 26° E.\n\nOn 7 November 1996, a contract was signed with Aérospatiale to provide the first of the third-generation satellites, to be based on a Spacebus 3000B2 platform.\n\nBADR-3 (technically: Arabsat-3A) was launched as the first satellite of the third generation, on 26 February 1999. Half of its transponders were switched off on 7 December 2001 after a solar-panel malfunction.\n\nArabsat let a contract on 22 October 2003 for the manufacture and launch of the fourth generation of Arabsat satellites, based on the Astrium's Eurostar E2000+ platform and Alcatel Space payload. The first of these, Arabsat-4A, was lost in space due to a launcher failure. This led to the ordering of BADR-6 (technically: Arabsat-4AR) on 31 May 2006. The second fourth generation satellite, named BADR-4 (technically: Arabsat-4B), was launched on 8 November 2006. BADR-6 was launched on 7 July 2008 on an Ariane 5, to replace the lost Arabsat-4A.\n\nArabsat let a contract on 16 June 2007 for the manufacture and launch of the fifth generation of Arabsat satellites, based on the Astrium's Eurostar E3000 platform and Thales Alenia Space payloads:\n\n\n\nAs of August 2016, Arabsat owns six operational satellites, at three orbital positions: 20° East, 26° East and 30.5° East.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Additionally, each number denotes the sum of all cells visible in any orthogonal direction before line of the loop is reached.

{"id": "89708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89708", "title": "Blackface", "text": "Blackface\n\nBlackface is a form of theatrical make-up used predominantly by non-black performers to represent a caricature of a black person. It is and has been a racially insensitive representation of blackness by the African American community. The practice gained popularity during the 19th century and contributed to the spread of racial stereotypes such as the \"happy-go-lucky darky on the plantation\" or the \"dandified coon\". In 1848, blackface minstrel shows were an American national art of the time, translating formal art such as opera into popular terms for a general audience. Early in the 20th century, blackface branched off from the minstrel show and became a form in its own right.\n\nBlackface was an important performance tradition in the American theater for roughly 100 years beginning around 1830. It quickly became popular elsewhere, particularly so in Britain, where the tradition lasted longer than in the U.S., occurring on primetime TV, most famously in \"The Black and White Minstrel Show\", which ended in 1978, and in \"Are You Being Served?\"s Christmas specials in 1976 and finally in 1981. In both the United States and Britain, blackface was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition, which it both predated and outlasted. Early white performers in blackface used burnt cork and later greasepaint or shoe polish to blacken their skin and exaggerate their lips, often wearing woolly wigs, gloves, tailcoats, or ragged clothes to complete the transformation. Later, black artists also performed in blackface.\n\nStereotypes embodied in the stock characters of blackface minstrels not only played a significant role in cementing and proliferating racist images, attitudes, and perceptions worldwide, but also in popularizing black culture. In some quarters, the caricatures that were the legacy of blackface persist to the present day and are a cause of ongoing controversy. Another view is that \"blackface is a form of cross-dressing in which one puts on the insignias of a sex, class, or race that stands in opposition to one's own.\"\n\nBy the mid-20th century, changing attitudes about race and racism effectively ended the prominence of blackface makeup used in performance in the U.S. and elsewhere. Blackface in contemporary art remains in relatively limited use as a theatrical device and is more commonly used today as social commentary or satire. Perhaps the most enduring effect of blackface is the precedent it established in the introduction of African-American culture to an international audience, albeit through a distorted lens. Blackface's appropriation, exploitation, and assimilation of African-American culture – as well as the inter-ethnic artistic collaborations that stemmed from it – were but a prologue to the lucrative packaging, marketing, and dissemination of African-American cultural expression and its myriad derivative forms in today's world popular culture.\n\nThere is no consensus about a single moment that constitutes the origin of blackface. John Strausbaugh places it as part of a tradition of \"displaying Blackness for the enjoyment and edification of white viewers\" that dates back at least to 1441, when captive West Africans were displayed in Portugal. Whites routinely portrayed the black characters in the Elizabethan and Jacobean theater (see English Renaissance theatre), most famously in \"Othello\" (1604). However, \"Othello\" and other plays of this era did not involve the emulation and caricature of \"such supposed innate qualities of Blackness as inherent musicality, natural athleticism\", etc. that Strausbaugh sees as crucial to blackface. Lewis Hallam, Jr., a white blackface actor of American Company fame, brought blackface in this more specific sense to prominence as a theatrical device in the United States when playing the role of \"Mungo\", an inebriated black man in \"The Padlock\", a British play that premiered in New York City at the John Street Theatre on May 29, 1769. The play attracted notice, and other performers adopted the style. From at least the 1810s, blackface clowns were popular in the United States. British actor Charles Mathews toured the U.S. in 1822–23, and as a result added a \"black\" characterization to his repertoire of British regional types for his next show, \"A Trip to America\", which included Mathews singing \"Possum up a Gum Tree\", a popular slave freedom song. Edwin Forrest played a plantation black in 1823, and George Washington Dixon was already building his stage career around blackface in 1828, but it was another white comic actor, Thomas D. Rice, who truly popularized blackface. Rice introduced the song \"Jump Jim Crow\" accompanied by a dance in his stage act in 1828 and scored stardom with it by 1832.\n\nRice traveled the U.S., performing under the stage name \"Daddy Jim Crow\". The name \"Jim Crow\" later became attached to statutes that codified the reinstitution of segregation and discrimination after Reconstruction.\n\nIn the 1830s and early 1840s, blackface performances mixed skits with comic songs and vigorous dances. Initially, Rice and his peers performed only in relatively disreputable venues, but as blackface gained popularity they gained opportunities to perform as \"entr'actes\" in theatrical venues of a higher class. Stereotyped blackface characters developed: buffoonish, lazy, superstitious, cowardly, and lascivious characters, who stole, lied pathologically, and mangled the English language. Early blackface minstrels were all male, so cross-dressing white men also played black women who were often portrayed as unappealingly and grotesquely mannish, in the matronly mammy mold, or as highly sexually provocative. The 1830s American stage, where blackface first rose to prominence, featured similarly comic stereotypes of the clever Yankee and the larger-than-life Frontiersman; the late 19th- and early 20th-century American and British stage where it last prospered featured many other, mostly ethnically-based, comic stereotypes: conniving, venal Jews; drunken brawling Irishmen with blarney at the ready; oily Italians; stodgy Germans; and gullible rural rubes.\n\n1830s and early 1840s blackface performers performed solo or as duos, with the occasional trio; the traveling troupes that would later characterize blackface minstrelsy arose only with the minstrel show. In New York City in 1843, Dan Emmett and his Virginia Minstrels broke blackface minstrelsy loose from its novelty act and \"entr'acte\" status and performed the first full-blown minstrel show: an evening's entertainment composed entirely of blackface performance. (E. P. Christy did more or less the same, apparently independently, earlier the same year in Buffalo, New York.) Their loosely structured show with the musicians sitting in a semicircle, a tambourine player on one end and a bones player on the other, set the precedent for what would soon become the first act of a standard three-act minstrel show. By 1852, the skits that had been part of blackface performance for decades expanded to one-act farces, often used as the show's third act.\n\nThe songs of northern composer Stephen Foster figured prominently in blackface minstrel shows of the period. Though written in dialect and certainly politically incorrect by today's standards, his later songs were free of the ridicule and blatantly racist caricatures that typified other songs of the genre. Foster's works treated slaves and the South in general with an often cloying sentimentality that appealed to audiences of the day.\n\nWhite minstrel shows featured white performers pretending to be blacks, playing their versions of black music and speaking ersatz black dialects. Minstrel shows dominated popular show business in the U.S. from that time through into the 1890s, also enjoying massive popularity in the UK and in other parts of Europe. As the minstrel show went into decline, blackface returned to its novelty act roots and became part of vaudeville. Blackface featured prominently in film at least into the 1930s, and the \"aural blackface\" of the \"Amos 'n' Andy\" radio show lasted into the 1950s. Meanwhile, amateur blackface minstrel shows continued to be common at least into the 1950s. In the UK, one such blackface popular in the 1950s was Ricardo Warley from Alston, Cumbria who toured around the North of England with a monkey called Bilbo.\n\nAs a result, the genre played an important role in shaping perceptions of and prejudices about blacks generally and African Americans in particular. Some social commentators have stated that blackface provided an outlet for whites' fear of the unknown and the unfamiliar, and a socially acceptable way of expressing their feelings and fears about race and control. Writes Eric Lott in \"Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class\", \"The black mask offered a way to play with the collective fears of a degraded and threatening – and male – Other while at the same time maintaining some symbolic control over them.\"\n\nHowever, at least initially, blackface could also give voice to an oppositional dynamic that was prohibited by society. As early as 1832, a blacked-up Thomas D. Rice was singing, \"An' I caution all white dandies not to come in my way, / For if dey insult me, dey'll in de gutter lay.\" It also on occasion equated lower-class white and lower-class black audiences; while parodying Shakespeare, Rice sang, \"Aldough I'm a black man, de white is call'd my broder.\"\n\n Through the 1930s, many well-known entertainers of stage and screen also performed in blackface. Whites who performed in blackface in film included Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, Buster Keaton, Joan Crawford, Irene Dunne, Doris Day, Milton Berle, William Holden, Marion Davies, Myrna Loy, Betty Grable, Dennis Morgan, Laurel and Hardy, Betty Hutton, The Three Stooges, Mickey Rooney, Shirley Temple, Judy Garland, Donald O'Connor and Chester Morris and George E. Stone in \"Boston Blackie's Rendezvous\". As late as the 1940s, Warner Bros. used blackface in a minstrel show sketch in \"This Is the Army\" (1943) and by casting Flora Robson as a Haitian maid in \"Saratoga Trunk\" (1945).\n\nIn the early years of film, black characters were routinely played by whites in blackface. In the first known film of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (1903) all of the major black roles were whites in blackface. Even the 1914 \"Uncle Tom\" starring African-American actor Sam Lucas in the title role had a white male in blackface as Topsy. D. W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915) used whites in blackface to represent all of its major black characters, but reaction against the film's racism largely put an end to this practice in dramatic film roles. Thereafter, whites in blackface would appear almost exclusively in broad comedies or \"ventriloquizing\" blackness in the context of a vaudeville or minstrel performance within a film. This stands in contrast to made-up whites routinely playing Native Americans, Asians, Arabs, and so forth, for several more decades.\n\nBlackface makeup was largely eliminated even from live film comedy in the U.S. after the end of the 1930s, when public sensibilities regarding race began to change and blackface became increasingly associated with racism and bigotry. Still, the tradition did not end all at once. The radio program \"Amos 'n' Andy\" (1928–60) constituted a type of \"aural blackface\", in that the black characters were portrayed by whites and conformed to stage blackface stereotypes. The conventions of blackface also lived on unmodified at least into the 1950s in animated theatrical cartoons. Strausbaugh estimates that roughly one-third of late 1940s MGM cartoons \"included a blackface, coon, or mammy figure.\" Bugs Bunny appeared in blackface at least as late as \"Southern Fried Rabbit\" in 1953.\n\nIn 1910, the ballet \"Sheherazade\", choreographed by Michael Fokine, premiered in Russia. The story behind the ballet was inspired by a tone poem written by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov. In the ballet the leading female character, Zobeide, is seduced by a Golden Slave. The dancer who portrayed the Golden Slave, the first being Vaslav Nijinsky, would have his face and body painted brown for the performance. This was done to show the audience the slave was of a darker complexion. Later in 1912, Fokine choreographed the ballet \"Petrushka\", which centers around three puppets that come to life, Petrushka, the Ballerina, and the Moor. When the ballet premiered, the part of the Moor, first danced by Alexander Orlov, was performed in full blackface. The Moor puppet is first seen onstage playing with a coconut, which he attempts to open with his scimitar. His movements are apelike. The Moor seduces the Ballerina and later savagely cuts off the head of the puppet Petrushka. When \"Petrushka\" is performed today, the part of the Moor is still done in full blackface, or occasionally blueface. The blackface has not been publicly criticized in the ballet community. Black and brownface appear in other ballets today, such as \"La Bayadère\" and \"Othello\", in the United States and Europe.\n\nBy 1840, black performers also were performing in blackface makeup. Frederick Douglass generally abhorred blackface and was one of the first people to write against the institution of blackface minstrelsy, condemning it as racist in nature, with inauthentic, northern, white origins. Douglass did, however, maintain: \"It is something to be gained when the colored man in any form can appear before a white audience.\"\n\nWhen all-black minstrel shows began to proliferate in the 1860s, they often were billed as \"authentic\" and \"the real thing\". These \"colored minstrels\" always claimed to be recently freed slaves (doubtlessly many were, but most were not) and were widely seen as authentic. This presumption of authenticity could be a bit of a trap, with white audiences seeing them more like \"animals in a zoo\" than skilled performers. Despite often smaller budgets and smaller venues, their public appeal sometimes rivalled that of white minstrel troupes. In March 1866, Booker and Clayton's Georgia Minstrels may have been the country's most popular troupe, and were certainly among the most critically acclaimed.\n\nThese \"colored\" troupes – many using the name \"Georgia Minstrels\" – focused on \"plantation\" material, rather than the more explicit social commentary (and more nastily racist stereotyping) found in portrayals of northern blacks. In the execution of authentic black music and the percussive, polyrhythmic tradition of \"pattin' Juba\", when the only instruments performers used were their hands and feet, clapping and slapping their bodies and shuffling and stomping their feet, black troupes particularly excelled. One of the most successful black minstrel companies was Sam Hague's Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels, managed by Charles Hicks. This company eventually was taken over by Charles Callendar. The Georgia Minstrels toured the United States and abroad and later became Haverly's Colored Minstrels.\n\nFrom the mid-1870s, as white blackface minstrelsy became increasingly lavish and moved away from \"Negro subjects\", black troupes took the opposite tack. The popularity of the Fisk Jubilee Singers and other \"jubilee singers\" had demonstrated northern white interest in white religious music as sung by blacks, especially spirituals. Some jubilee troupes pitched themselves as quasi-minstrels and even incorporated minstrel songs; meanwhile, blackface troupes began to adopt first jubilee material and then a broader range of southern black religious material. Within a few years, the word \"jubilee\", originally used by the Fisk Jubilee Singers to set themselves apart from blackface minstrels and to emphasize the religious character of their music, became little more than a synonym for \"plantation\" material. Where the jubilee singers tried to \"clean up\" Southern black religion for white consumption, blackface performers exaggerated its more exotic aspects.\n\nAfrican-American blackface productions also contained buffoonery and comedy, by way of self-parody. In the early days of African-American involvement in theatrical performance, blacks could not perform without blackface makeup, regardless of how dark-skinned they were. The 1860s \"colored\" troupes violated this convention for a time: the comedy-oriented endmen \"corked up\", but the other performers \"astonished\" commentators by the diversity of their hues. Still, their performances were largely in accord with established blackface stereotypes.\n\nThese black performers became stars within the broad African-American community, but were largely ignored or condemned by the black bourgeoisie. James Monroe Trotter  – a middle-class African American who had contempt for their \"disgusting caricaturing\" but admired their \"highly musical culture\" – wrote in 1882 that \"few ... who condemned black minstrels for giving 'aid and comfort to the enemy'\" had ever seen them perform. Unlike white audiences, black audiences presumably always recognized blackface performance as caricature, and took pleasure in seeing their own culture observed and reflected, much as they would half a century later in the performances of Moms Mabley.\n\nDespite reinforcing racist stereotypes, blackface minstrelsy was a practical and often relatively lucrative livelihood when compared to the menial labor to which most blacks were relegated. Owing to the discrimination of the day, \"corking (or blacking) up\" provided an often singular opportunity for African-American musicians, actors, and dancers to practice their crafts. Some minstrel shows, particularly when performing outside the South, also managed subtly to poke fun at the racist attitudes and double standards of white society or champion the abolitionist cause. It was through blackface performers, white and black, that the richness and exuberance of African-American music, humor, and dance first reached mainstream, white audiences in the U.S. and abroad. It was through blackface minstrelsy that African American performers first entered the mainstream of American show business. Black performers used blackface performance to satirize white behavior. It was also a forum for the sexual double entendre gags that were frowned upon by white moralists. There was often a subtle message behind the outrageous vaudeville routines:\n\nWith the rise of vaudeville, Bahamian-born actor and comedian Bert Williams became Florenz Ziegfeld's highest-paid star and only African-American star.\n\nIn the Theater Owners Booking Association (TOBA), an all-black vaudeville circuit organized in 1909, blackface acts were a popular staple. Called \"Toby\" for short, performers also nicknamed it \"Tough on Black Actors\" (or, variously, \"Artists\" or \"Asses\"), because earnings were so meager. Still, TOBA headliners like Tim Moore and Johnny Hudgins could make a very good living, and even for lesser players, TOBA provided fairly steady, more desirable work than generally was available elsewhere. Blackface served as a springboard for hundreds of artists and entertainers – black and white – many of whom later would go on to find work in other performance traditions. For example, one of the most famous stars of Haverly's European Minstrels was Sam Lucas, who became known as the \"Grand Old Man of the Negro Stage\". Lucas later played the title role in the 1914 cinematic production of Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". From the early 1930s to the late 1940s, New York City's famous Apollo Theater in Harlem featured skits in which almost all black male performers wore the blackface makeup and huge white painted lips, despite protests that it was degrading from the NAACP. The comics said they felt \"naked\" without it.\n\nThe minstrel show was appropriated by the black performer from the original white shows, but only in its general form. Blacks took over the form and made it their own. The professionalism of performance came from black theater. Some argue that the black minstrels gave the shows vitality and humor that the white shows never had. As the black social critic LeRoi Jones has written:\n\nThe black minstrel performer was not only poking fun at himself but in a more profound way, he was poking fun at the white man. The cakewalk is caricaturing white customs, while white theater companies attempted to satirize the cakewalk as a black dance. Again, as LeRoi Jones notes:\n\nThe degree to which blackface performance drew on authentic African-American culture and traditions is controversial. Blacks, including slaves, were influenced by white culture, including white musical culture. Certainly this was the case with church music from very early times. Complicating matters further, once the blackface era began, some blackface minstrel songs unquestionably written by New York-based professionals (Stephen Foster, for example) made their way to the plantations in the South and merged into the body of African-American folk music.\n\nIt seems clear, however, that American music by the early 19th century was an interwoven mixture of many influences, and that blacks were quite aware of white musical traditions and incorporated these into their music.\n\nEarly blackface minstrels often said that their material was largely or entirely authentic to African-American culture; John Strausbaugh, author of \"Black Like You\", said that such claims were likely to be untrue. Well into the 20th century, scholars took the stories at face value. Constance Rourke, one of the founders of what is now known as cultural studies, largely assumed this as late as 1931. In the Civil Rights era there was a strong reaction against this view, to the point of denying that blackface was anything other than a white racist counterfeit. Starting no later than Robert Toll's \"Blacking Up\" (1974), a \"third wave\" has systematically studied the origins of blackface, and has put forward a nuanced picture: that blackface did, indeed, draw on African-American culture, but that it transformed, stereotyped, and caricatured that culture, resulting in often racist representations of black characters.\n\nAs discussed above, this picture becomes even more complicated after the Civil War, when many African Americans became blackface performers. They drew on much material of undoubted slave origins, but they also drew on a professional performer's instincts, while working within an established genre, and with the same motivation as white performers to make exaggerated claims of the authenticity of their own material.\n\nAuthor Strausbaugh summed up as follows: \"Some minstrel songs started as Negro folk songs, were adapted by White minstrels, became widely popular, and were readopted by Blacks,\" writes Strausbaugh. \"The question of whether minstrelsy was white or black music was moot. It was a mix, a mutt – that is, it was American music.\"\n\nThe darky icon itself – googly-eyed, with inky skin, exaggerated white, pink or red lips, and bright, white teeth – became a common motif in entertainment, children's literature, mechanical banks, and other toys and games of all sorts, cartoons and comic strips, advertisements, jewelry, textiles, postcards, sheet music, food branding and packaging, and other consumer goods.\n\nIn 1895, the Golliwog surfaced in Great Britain, the product of children's book illustrator Florence Kate Upton, who modeled her rag doll character after a minstrel doll from her American childhood. \"Golly\", as he later affectionately came to be called, had a jet-black face, wild, woolly hair, bright, red lips, and sported formal minstrel attire. The generic British golliwog later made its way back across the Atlantic as dolls, toy tea sets, ladies' perfume, and in myriad of other forms. The word \"golliwog\" may have given rise to the ethnic slur \"wog\".\n\nU.S. cartoons from the 1930s and 1940s often featured characters in blackface gags as well as other racial and ethnic caricatures. Blackface was one of the influences in the development of characters such as Mickey Mouse. The United Artists 1933 release \"Mickey's Mellerdrammer\" – the name a corruption of \"melodrama\" thought to harken back to the earliest minstrel shows – was a film short based on a production of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" by the Disney characters. Mickey, of course, was already black, but the advertising poster for the film shows Mickey with exaggerated, orange lips; bushy, white sidewhiskers; and his now trademark white gloves.\n\nIn the U.S., by the 1950s, the NAACP had begun calling attention to such portrayals of African Americans and mounted a campaign to put an end to blackface performances and depictions. For decades, darky images had been seen in the branding of everyday products and commodities such as \"Picaninny Freeze\", the Coon Chicken Inn restaurant chain, and Nigger Hair Tobacco. With the eventual successes of the modern day Civil Rights Movement, such blatantly racist branding practices ended in the U.S., and blackface became an American taboo.\n\nHowever, blackface-inspired iconography continue in popular media in Asia. In Japan, in the early 1960s, a toy called Dakkochan became hugely popular. \"Dakkochan\" was a black child with large red lips and a grass skirt. There were boy and girl dolls, with the girls being distinguished by a bow. The black skin of the dolls was said to have been significant and in-line with the rising popularity of jazz. Novelist Tensei Kawano went as far as to state, \"We of the younger generation are outcasts from politics and society. In a way we are like Negroes, who have a long record of oppression and misunderstanding, and we feel akin to them.\" Japanese cartoons continue to prominently feature characters inspired by \"darky\" iconography, including well-known Mr. Popo in popular series Dragonball Z.\n\nTo this present day, prominent brands continue to use the iconography, including Chinese toothpaste brand Darlie, which was re-named from \"Darkie\", and 'Black Man' in Thailand. Vaudeville-inspired blackface remains frequently utilized in commercials.\nOver time, blackface and \"darky\" iconography became artistic and stylistic devices associated with art deco and the Jazz Age. By the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in Europe, where it was more widely tolerated, blackface became a kind of \"outré\", camp convention in some artistic circles. \"The Black and White Minstrel Show\" was a popular British musical variety show that featured blackface performers, and remained on British television until 1978 and in stage shows until 1989. Many of the songs were from the music hall, country and western and folk traditions. Actors and dancers in blackface appeared in music videos such as Grace Jones's \"Slave to the Rhythm\" (1980, also part of her touring piece \"A One Man Show\"), Culture Club's \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\" (1982) and Taco's \"Puttin' On the Ritz\" (1983).\n\nWhen trade and tourism produce a confluence of cultures, bringing differing sensibilities regarding blackface into contact with one another, the results can be jarring. When Japanese toymaker Sanrio Corporation exported a darky-icon character doll (the doll, Bibinba, had fat, pink lips and rings in its ears) in the 1990s, the ensuing controversy prompted Sanrio to halt production.\n\nTrademark for Conguitos, a confection manufactured by the LACASA Group features a tubby, little brown character with full, red lips. In Britain, \"Golly\", a golliwog character, fell out of favor in 2001 after almost a century as the trademark of jam producer James Robertson & Sons, but the debate still continues whether the golliwog should be banished in all forms from further commercial production and display, or preserved as a treasured childhood icon. In France, the chocolate powder Banania still uses a little black boy with large red lips as its emblem. The licorice brand Tabu, owned by Perfetti Van Melle and distributed in Europe, introduced a cartoon minstrel mascot in the 1980s inspired by Al Jolson's blackface performance in \"The Jazz Singer\", which is still in use today.\n\nThe influence of blackface on branding and advertising, as well as on perceptions and portrayals of blacks, generally, can be found worldwide.\n\nDigital media provide opportunities to inhabit and perform black identity without actually painting one's face. In 1999, Adam Clayton Powell III coined the term \"high-tech blackface\" to refer to stereotypical portrayals of black characters in video games. David Leonard writes that \"The desire to 'be black' because of the stereotypical visions of strength, athleticism, power and sexual potency all play out within the virtual reality of sports games.\" Leonard's argument suggests that players perform a type of identity tourism by controlling black avatars in sports games. Phillips and Reed argue that this type of blackface \"is not only about whites assuming black roles, nor about exaggerated performances of blackness for the benefit of a racist audience. Rather, it is about performing a version of blackness that constrains it within the boundaries legible to white supremacy.\"\n\nSocial media has also facilitated the spread of blackface in culture. In 2016, a controversy emerged over Snapchat's Bob Marley filter, which allowed users to superimpose dark skin, dreadlocks, and a knitted cap over their own faces. A number of controversies have also emerged about students at American universities sharing images of themselves appearing to wear blackface makeup. Additionally, writers such as Lauren Michele Jackson and Victoria Princewill have criticized non-black people sharing animated images of black people or black-skinned emojis, calling the practice \"digital blackface\".\n\nIn 1980 the white members of UB40 appeared in blackface in their \"Dream a Lie\" video. The black members of the group wore white makeup on their faces to give the opposite appearance.\n\nPapa Lazarou was a character in the comedy-horror TV show \"The League of Gentlemen\" in the 1990s, and a subsequent movie. His exaggerated form of gypsy-styled blackface embodied the 'local' characters' fear of outsiders. It was revealed at the end of the series that this was his actual skin colour.\n\nA sketch in a 2003 episode of \"Little Britain\" features two characters who appear in blackface as minstrels, as regularly seen on British television until the 1980s. The same characters return for one 2005 sketch. In the sketches, the racist overtones are subverted with the characters presented as belonging to a race genuinely possessing the appearance of white men in blackface (referred to as \"Minstrels\") who are persecuted by the public and local government.\n\nComedians in many Asian countries continue to occasionally use minstrel-inspired blackface, with considerable frequency in South Korea.\n\nIn October 2009, a talent-search skit on Australian TV's \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\" reunion show featured a tribute group for Michael Jackson, the \"Jackson Jive\" in blackface, with the Michael Jackson character in whiteface. American performer Harry Connick, Jr. was one of the guest judges and objected to the act, stating that he believed it was offensive to black people, and gave the troupe a score of zero. The show and the group later apologised to Connick, with the troupe leader of Indian descent stating that the skit was not intended to be offensive or racist.\n\nThe \"Mohrenbrauerei\" in Dornbirn, Austria, uses a blackface type drawing in its logo.\n\nIn \"Tintin in the Congo\", cartoonist Hergé uses a blackface type drawing style to depict the native Congolese. And in the Dutch comic \"Sjors & Sjimmie\", started in 1902, Sjimmy was initially depicted in the same way, but was gradually turned into a normal, but black, Dutch boy and in 1969, when Jan Kruis took over the comic, his transformation to a normal black boy was complete.\n\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium, people annually celebrate St. Nicolas Eve with Sinterklaas accompanied by multiple Zwarte Pieten in the form of adolescent boys and girls, and men and women, with their face painted black, or different colors or styles in some large city parades nowadays, wearing Moorish page boy costumes. The Moorish Zwarte Piet character has been traced back to the middle of the 19th century when Jan Schenkman, a popular children's book author, added a black servant to the Sinterklaas story. However, the original and archetypal Zwarte Piet is believed to be a continuation of a much older custom in which people with black faces appeared in Winter Solstice rituals. In other parts of Western Europe and in Central Europe, black-faced and masked people also perform the role of companions of Saint Nicholas, who is known as Nikolo in Austria, Niklaus in Germany and Samichlaus in Switzerland. Also on Saint Martin's Eve, black-faced men go around in processions through Wörgl and the Lower Inn Valley, in Tyrol.\n\nUp until the early 2000s, white comedians sometimes used makeup to represent a black person, most often as a parody of an actual person. Many of these segments have been aired during the annual New Year's Eve TV special \"Bye Bye.\" For instance, the 1986 edition features three such skits:\n\n\nThe Montreal-based satiric group Rock et Belles Oreilles did its own blackface sketches, for instance when comedian Yves Pelletier disguised himself as comedian and show host Gregory Charles, making fun of his energetic personality (not of his racial background) on his television game show \"Que le meilleur gagne\". RBO also did a parody of a talk show where a strongly stereotypical fictitious Haitian man (Pelletier again) was easily offended, as well as a group parody of the Caribbean band La Compagnie Créole and a sketch about the lines of African-American actors that were mangled in movie translations. Pelletier did another parody of Gregory Charles for the New Year's Eve TV special \"Le Bye Bye de RBO\" in 2006 (as an homage to Charles who had had a particularly successful year), along with a parody of Governor General Michaëlle Jean. And in RBO's 2007 \"Bye Bye\", Guy A. Lepage impersonated a black Quebecer testifying during the Bouchard-Taylor hearings on cultural differences, while in another sketch, Lepage, Pelletier and Bruno Landry impersonated injured Darfur residents.\n\nIn September 2011, HEC Montréal students caused a stir when using blackface to \"pay tribute\" to Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt during Frosh Week. The story went national, and was even covered on CNN. The university students were filmed in Jamaican flag colours, chanting \"smoke weed\" in a chorus. The University later apologized for the lack of consciousness of its student body.\n\nIn May 2013, comedian Mario Jean took part in an award show to imitated several fellow comics, donning blackface when he came to Boucar Diouf (), an African-born story-teller. Many Quebec pundits defended the practice and Diouf himself praised Jean for his open-mindedness.\n\nIn December 2013, white actor Joel Legendre () performed in blackface in \"Bye Bye 2013\", in yet another parody of Gregory Charles, this time as host of the variety show \"Le choc des générations\".\n\nIn December 2014, the satirical end-of-year production by Théâtre du Rideau Vert, a mainstream theatre company, included a blackface representation of hockey player P.K. Subban by actor Marc Saint-Martin. Despite some criticism the sketch was not withdrawn.\n\nIn June 2018, theatre director Robert Lepage was accused of staging scenes that were reminiscent of blackface when he put together the show \"SLĀV\" at the Montreal Jazz Festival, notably because white performers were dressed as slaves as they picked cotton. After two initial performances, lead singer Betty Bonifassi broke an ankle and the rest of the summer run was canceled, but later performances were nevertheless scheduled in other venues. The controversy prompted further protests about the play \"Kanata\" that Lepage was to stage in Paris about the Canadian Indian residential school system – without resorting to any indigenous actors. The project was briefly put on hold when investors pulled out, but the production eventually resumed as planned.\n\nThere are some occurrences of blacking up (completely covering the entire exposed body) with afro wigs and stereotypical grass skirts and costume at festivals in this African country.\n\nOn February 15, 2018, a comedy sketch titled \"Same Joy, Same Happiness\" intending to celebrate Chinese-African ties on the CCTV New Year's Gala, which draws an audience of up to 800 million, showed a Chinese actress in blackface makeup with a giant fake bottom playing an African mother, while a performer only exposing black arms playing a monkey accompanied her. At the end of the skit, the actress shouted, \"I love Chinese people! I love China!\" After being broadcast, the scene was widely criticized being \"disgusting\", \"awkward\" and \"completely racist\" on Twitter and Sina Weibo. But according to the street interviews by the Associated Press in Beijing on February 16, some Chinese people believed this kind of criticism was overblown. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, who also watched the skit, said that China had consistently opposed any form of racism, and added, \"I want to say that if there are people who want to seize on an incident to exaggerate matters, and sow discord in China's relations with African countries, this is a doomed futile effort\" at a daily news briefing on February 22.\n\nIn Europe, there are a number of folk dances or folk performances in which the black face appears to represent the night, or the coming of the longer nights associated with winter. Many fall or autumn North European folk black face customs are employed ritualistically to appease the forces of the oncoming winter, utilizing characters with blackened faces, or black masks.\n\nIn Finland, a version of the Star boys' singing procession originating in the city of Oulu, a musical play known as Tiernapojat, has become established as a cherished Christmas tradition nationwide. The Tiernapojat show is a staple of Christmas festivities in schools, kindergartens, and elsewhere, and it is broadcast every Christmas on radio and television. The Finnish version contains non-biblical elements such as king Herod vanquishing the \"king of the Moors\", whose face in the play has traditionally been painted black. The character's color of skin is also a theme in the procession's lyrics.\n\nA group of showmen in the Cologne Carnival called \"Negerköpp\", founded in 1929, act with their hands and faces painted black.\n\nThe Germany-based Dutch musician Taco Ockerse stirred up controversy in 1983 by using dancers in blackface for his hit synthpop version of \"Puttin' on the Ritz\".\n\nIn Germany, blackface was used in several theatrical productions.\n\nExamples of theatrical productions include the many productions of the play \"Unschuld\" (Innocence) by the German writer Dea Loher, although in this play about two black African immigrants, the use of black-face is not part of the stage directions or instructions.\nThe staging of the play \"Unschuld\" (Innocence) at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin was also subject of protest. The activist group \"Bühnenwatch\" (stage watch) performed a stunt in one of the stagings: 42 activists, posing as spectators, left the audience without a word and later distributed leaflets to the audience. Fundamental of the criticism was that the use of black-face solidifies stereotypes regardless of any good intentions and supports racist structures. The critics were invited to a discussion with the director, actors, theatre manager and other artists of the Deutsches Theater. As a result of the discussion, Deutsches Theater changed the design of actor make-up. Ulrich Khuon, the theatre manager, later admitted to being surprised by the protest and is now in a process of reflection.\n\nGerman productions of Herb Gardner's \"I'm Not Rappaport\" almost always cast the role of Midge Carter, the black character, famously portrayed in the U.S. by Ossie Davis, with a white actor in black makeup. The 2012 production of the play at the Berlin Schlosspark-Theater was the subject of protest. The director, Thomas Schendel, in his response to critics, argued that the classical and common plays would not offer enough roles that would justify a repertoire position for a black actor in a German theatre company. The protest grew considerably and was followed by media reports. While advocates of the theatre indicated that in principle it should be possible for any actor to play any character and that the play itself has an anti-racist message, the critics noted that the letter unwillingly disclosed the general, unexpressed policy of German theatres, i.e., that white actors are accounted to be qualified for all roles, even black ones, while black actors are suitable only for black roles. Other authors said that this problem in Germany generally exists for citizens with an immigrant background. The debate also received foreign media attention. The Schlosspark-Theater announced plans to continue the performances, and the German publishing company of \"Rappaport\" stated it will continue to grant permits for such performances.\n\nGerman dramatists commented on the debate:\n\nIn 2012, the American dramatist Bruce Norris cancelled a German production of his play \"Clybourne Park\" when it was disclosed that a white actress would portray the African-American \"Francine\". A subsequent production using black German actors was successfully staged.\n\nGuatemalan 2015 elected president, Jimmy Morales, was a comic actor. One of the characters he impersonated in his comic show \"Moralejas\" was called Black Pitaya which used blackface makeup. Jimmy Morales defended his blackface character saying he is adored by the country's black Garifuna and indigenous Mayan communities.\n\nHajji Firuz is a character in Iranian folklore who appears in the streets by the beginning of the New Year festival of Nowruz. His face is covered in black soot, which is to symbolize the dirt and dust from the previous year.\n\nIn Japanese hip hop, a subculture of hip-hoppers subscribe to the \"burapan\" style, and are referred to as blackfacers. The appearance of these blackfacers is evidence of the popularity of the hip-hop movement in Japan despite what is described as racist tendencies in the culture. Some Japanese fans of hip-hop find it embarrassing and ridiculous that blackface fans do this because they feel like they should not change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it can be seen as a racist act, but for many of the young Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. The use of blackface is seen by some as a way to rebel against the culture of surface images in Japan.\n\nBlackface also remains a contentious issue outside of hip hop. One Japanese R&B group, the Gosperats, has been known to wear blackface makeup during performances. In March 2015 a music television program produced by the Fuji TV network was scheduled to show a segment featuring two Japanese groups performing together in blackface, Rats & Star and Momoiro Clover Z. A picture was published online by one of the Rats & Star members after the segment was recorded, which led to a campaign against broadcasting of the segment. The program that aired on March 7 was edited by the network to remove the segment \"after considering the overall circumstances\", but the announcement did not acknowledge the campaign against the segment.\n\nIn modern-day Mexico there are examples of images (usually caricatures) in blackface (e.g., Memín Pinguín). Though there is backlash from international communities, Mexican society has not protested to have these images changed to racially sensitive images. On the contrary, in the controversial Memín Pinguín cartoon there has been support publicly and politically (chancellor for Mexico, Luis Ernesto Derbez). Currently in Mexico, only 3–4% of the population are composed of Afro-Mexicans (this percentage includes Asian Mexicans).\n\nA notorious example of blackface in Mexican media is a comedic episode based around the Civil War titled \"La guerra de secesión de los Estados Unidos\" (The U.S. Secession War) in which famous comedian Chespirito did a skit in blackface.\n\nPortobelo's Carnival and Congo dance in Panama include a use of blackface as a form of celebration of African history, an emancipatory symbol. Black men paint their faces with charcoal representing three things. Firstly, the blackface is used as a tool to remember their African ancestors. Secondly, the black face is representative of the disguise or concealment on the run slaves would have used to evade the Spanish colonizers. Lastly, the practice of blackface is used as a way to signify the code or \"secret language\" slaves would have used during the time of Spanish occupation. During the celebration, for example, good morning will mean good night, and wearing black, or in this case blackface, which normally denotes a time of mourning, is used as a way to represent a time of celebration instead.\n\nIn Portugal, there is not a long history of use of actors in blackface for \"serious\" performances meant for realistic black character, but the use of blackface for comedy keeps being used frequently well into the 21st century. The talk-show 5 Para a Meia-Noite, examples of which some episodes were hosted by Luís Filipe Borges and Pedro Fernandes, who have both done it, used it almost on a weekly basis. Recently, Eduardo Madeira dressed up as Serena Williams, adding an African accent the tennis player does not have in real life. Use of black performance in impersonations was quite frequently used in the (ongoing) song and impressions show \"A Tua Cara não Me É Estranha\", with blackface impressions of Michael Jackson, Siedah Garrett, Tracy Chapman, Louie Armstrong, Nat King Cole, among others.\n\nIn Brazil, there has been at least some history of non-comedic use of blackface, using white actors for black characters like Uncle Tom (although the practice of \"racelift\", or making black/mulatto characters into mestiços/swarthy whites/caboclos, is more frequent than blackface). Use of blackface in humor has been used more rarely than in Portugal, although it also continues into this century (but it creates major uproar among the sizeable and more politically active Afro-Brazilian community).\n\nInspired by blackface minstrels who visited Cape Town, South Africa, in 1848, former Javanese and Malay coolies took up the minstrel tradition, holding emancipation celebrations which consisted of music, dancing and parades. Such celebrations eventually became consolidated into an annual, year-end event called the \"Coon Carnival\" but now known as the Cape Town Minstrel Carnival or the Kaapse Klopse.\n\nToday, carnival minstrels are mostly Coloured (\"mixed race\"), Afrikaans-speaking revelers. Often in a pared-down style of blackface which exaggerates only the lips. They parade down the streets of the city in colorful costumes, in a celebration of Creole culture. Participants also pay homage to the carnival's African-American roots, playing Negro spirituals and jazz featuring traditional Dixieland jazz instruments, including horns, banjos, and tambourines.\n\nThe South African actor and filmmaker Leon Schuster is well known for employing the blackface technique in his filming to little or no controversy. But in 2013, the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa halted the airing of an ad wherein Schuster portrayed a stereotypically dishonest African politician in blackface. The action was in response to the following submitted complaint:\n\nVodacom South Africa has also been accused of using non-African actors in blackface in its advertising as opposed to simply using African actors. Some have denounced blackface as an artefact of apartheid, accusing broadcasters of lampooning Black people. Others continue to see it as \"harmless fun\". In 2014, photos of two white University of Pretoria female students donning blackface makeup in an attempt at caricaturing Black domestic workers surfaced on Facebook. The students were said to face disciplinary action for throwing the institution's name into disrepute, this despite having perpetrated the incident at a private party and later taking down the images. University of Stellenbosch students Poekie Briedenhann and a friend drew much controversy after posting a picture of themselves in what appeared be dark paint and were subsequently accused of donning \"blackface\" and wrongfully suspended from their residence and later reinstated. The pair claimed they had been dressed up as purple aliens for a space-themed residence party.\n\nIn Thailand, actors darken their faces to portray the Negrito of Thailand in a popular play by King Chulalongkorn (1868–1910), \"Ngo Pa\" (), which has been turned into a musical and a movie.\n\nFrom 1723–1823, it was a criminal offence to blacken one's face in some circumstances, with a punishment of death. The Black Act was passed at a time of economic downturn that led to heightened social tensions, and in response to a series of raids by two groups of poachers who blackened their faces to prevent identification. Blackening one's face with soot, lampblack, boot polish or coal dust being a traditional form of disguise, or masking, in the UK, especially at night when poaching. It was also undertaken by smugglers off the South Coast of England, which is why many of the marchers representing smugglers in Lewes and other Sussex bonfire societies wear blackface.\n\nThe Welsh Rebecca Rioters (1839–1843) used to blacken their faces and/or wear masks to prevent themselves being identified whilst breaking down turnpike gates, sometimes dressed as women.\n\nSouth Western English traditional folk plays sometimes have a Turk Slaver character, probably from the Barbary Coast Slave raids on Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset in the early 17th Century by \"Sallee Rovers\" (where the English were the slaves captured and taken by force to North Africa). This character is usually played using a black face (or brownface).\n\nVarious forms of folk dance in England, including Morris dancing, have traditionally used blackface; its continuing use by some troupes is controversial.\n\nMolly Dancers and Cornish Guise Dancers, both of whom are usually traditionally associated with midwinter festivals, often use blacked faces as a disguise. As the Molly dancers wished to avoid being identified by the landlords and petty nobles, who were also usually the local Magistrates, when they played tricks on those who failed to be generous enough in their gifts to the dancers. And the Guise dancers (disguised dancers) also wished to avoid any punishment for their mocking songs embarrassing the local gentry.\n\nIn Bacup, Lancashire, the Britannia Coco-nut Dancers, wear black faces. Some believe the origin of this dance can be traced back to the influx of Cornish miners to northern England, and the black face relates to the dirty blackened faces associated with mining.\n\nIn Cornwall, several Mummer's Day celebrations are still held; these used to be sometimes known as \"Darkie Day\" (a corruption of the original \"Darking Day\", referring to the darkening or painting of the faces) and involved local residents dancing through the streets in blackface to musical accompaniment. Although the origins of blacking-up for Mummer's Day have no racial connotations – the tradition is pagan in origin and goes back to the days of the Celts – controversially, in the Padstow festival, minstrel songs, such as one song with the words \"He's gone where the good niggers go\", were formerly included due to the popularity of minstrel songs during the early 20th century, perhaps due to people not being aware of the pagan origins of the face painting.\n\nThe traditional wedding day chimney sweep, that is considered to be good luck, sometimes has a partially blacked up face to suggest smears of soot. This depends on the performer but it was, and still is, unusual to have a full blackening. Though the complete covered \"greyface\" is known.\n\nThese two traditions, of chimney sweep and folk dancing, coincide in the sometimes lost traditions of (chimney)sweepers festivals. Medway Council supports the Sweeps' Festival, revived in 1981, now claimed to be \"the largest festival of Morris dance in the world\". It takes place in Rochester around May Day and features a Jack in the Green character. Originally the chimney sweeps were little boys, and they used the day to beg for money, until this child labour was outlawed.\n\nOn Guy Fawkes' Day 2017, participants in the Lewes Bonfire, the best known of the Sussex bonfire tradition, decided to abandon black face paint in their depiction of Zulu warriors. However, as of 5 November 2018 many of the components of the various bonfire society marches who march as smugglers, in black and white striped tops, still black up just as they always have, representing the tradition that actual smugglers who they represent blacked up to conceal their identity. Numerous Red Indians and Vikings also march in Lewes.\n\nIn the early 20th century, group of African-American laborers began a marching club in the New Orleans Mardi Gras parade, dressed as hobos and calling themselves \"The Tramps\". Wanting a flashier look, they renamed themselves \"Zulus\" and copied their costumes from a blackface vaudeville skit performed at a local black jazz club and cabaret. The result is one of the best known and most striking krewes of Mardi Gras, the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club. Dressed in grass skirts, top hats and exaggerated blackface, the Zulus of New Orleans are controversial as well as popular.\n\nAn example of the disregard in American culture for racial boundaries and the color line was the popular duo Amos 'n' Andy, characters played by two white men. They gradually stripped off the blackface makeup during live 1929 performances while continuing to talk in dialect (see African-American English).\n\nIn 1936 Orson Welles was touring his \"Voodoo Macbeth\"; the lead actor, Maurice Ellis, fell ill, so Welles stepped into the role, performing in blackface.\n\nThe wearing of blackface was once a regular part of the annual Mummers Parade in Philadelphia. Growing dissent from civil rights groups and the offense of the black community led to a 1964 city policy, ruling out blackface. Despite the ban on blackface, brownface was still used in the parade in 2016 to depict Mexicans, causing outrage once again among civil rights groups. Also in 1964, bowing to pressure from the interracial group Concern, teenagers in Norfolk, Connecticut, reluctantly agreed to discontinue using blackface in their traditional minstrel show that was a fund-raiser for the March of Dimes.\n\nGrace Slick, singer of Jefferson Airplane, was wearing blackface when they performed \"Crown of Creation\" and \"Lather\" at The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1968. A clip is included in a 2004 documentary \"Fly Jefferson Airplane\", directed by Bob Sarles. Frank Zappa is depicted in blackface on the covers of his triple album \"Joe's Garage\", released in 1979. In 1980, an underground film, \"Forbidden Zone\", was released, directed by Richard Elfman and starring the band Oingo Boingo, which received controversy for blackface sequences.\n\nJoni Mitchell has donned blackface numerous times throughout her career, even marketing her 1977 album using her alter ego \"Art Nouveau\" on her album cover \"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\".\n\nMitchell has remained unapologetic about her alter 'persona,' citing that she \"does not have the soul of a white woman ... I write like a black poet. I frequently write from a black perspective\" in an interview with LA Weekly.\nHer denial of any fault has not gone without criticism, as Sheila Weller writes in her book \"Girls Like Us\" \"Joni romanticized being black, without the disadvantages. She would increasingly insist that her music was 'black' and that, as it progressed deeply into jazz, it should be played on black stations (it rarely was).\"\n\n\"Soul Man\" is a 1986 American film featuring C. Thomas Howell as Mark Watson a pampered rich college graduate who uses 'tanning pills' in order to qualify for a Graduate school scholarship to Harvard Law only available to African American students. He expects to be treated as a fellow student and instead learns the isolation of 'being black' on campus. Mark Watson later befriends and falls in love with the original candidate of the scholarship, a single mother who works as a waitress to support her education. The character later 'comes out' as white, leading to the famous defending line \"Can you blame him for the color of his skin?\"\nThe film was met with vast criticism of a white man donning black face to humanize white ignorance at the expense of African American viewers. Despite a large box office intake, has scored low on every film critic platform.\n\"A white man donning blackface is taboo,\" said C Thomas Howell \"Conversation over – you can't win. But our intentions were pure: We wanted to make a funny movie that had a message about racism.\"\n\nFormer Illinois congressman and House Republican party minority leader Bob Michel caused a minor stir in 1988, when on the \"USA Today\" television program he fondly recalled minstrel shows in which he had participated as a young man and expressed his regret that they had fallen out of fashion.\n\n\"Trading Places\" is a 1983 American film, telling the elaborate story of a commodities banker and street hustler crossing paths after being made part of a bet. The film features a scene between Eddie Murphy, Jamie Lee Curtis, Denholm Elliott, and Dan Aykroyd when they must don disguises to enter a train. For no reason relevant to the plot Dan Aykroyd's character puts on full black face make up, a dread locked wig and a Jamaican accent to fill the position of a Jamaican pot head.\n\nThe film has received very little criticism for its use of racial and Ethnic stereotype, Rotten Tomatoes even citing it as \"featuring deft interplay between Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, Trading Places is an immensely appealing social satire.\"\n\nIn 1993, white actor Ted Danson ignited a firestorm of controversy when he appeared at a New York Friars' Club roast in blackface, delivering a risqué shtick written by his then love interest, African-American comedian Whoopi Goldberg.\nBlackface and minstrelsy serve as the theme of Spike Lee's film \"Bamboozled\" (2000). It tells of a disgruntled black television executive who reintroduces the old blackface style in a series concept in an attempt to get himself fired, and is instead horrified by its success. The original design of the Pokémon character Jynx caused controversy over its alleged resemblance to a blackface caricature. It has since been redesigned with a purple skin tone.\n\nCommodities bearing iconic \"darky\" images, from tableware, soap and toy marbles to home accessories and T-shirts, continue to be manufactured and marketed. Some are reproductions of historical artifacts, while others are so-called \"fantasy\" items, newly designed for the marketplace. There is a thriving niche market for such items in the U.S., particularly. The value of the original artifacts of darky iconography (vintage \"negrobilia\") has risen steadily since the 1970s.\n\nThere have been several inflammatory incidents of white college students donning blackface. Such incidents usually escalate around Halloween, with students accused of perpetuating racial stereotypes.\n\nJimmy Kimmel donned black paint over his body and used an exaggerated, accented voice to portray NBA player Karl Malone on The Man Show in 2003. Kimmel repeatedly impersonated the NBA player on The Man Show and even made an appearance on Crank Yankers using his exaggerated AAVE to prank call about Beanie Babies.\n\n\"A Mighty Heart\" is a 2007 American film featuring Angelina Jolie playing Mariane Pearl, the wife of the kidnapped Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Mariane Pearl is of multiracial descent, born from an Afro-Chinese-Cuban mother and a Dutch Jewish father. She personally cast Angelina Jolie to play herself, defending the choice to have Jolie \"sporting a spray tan and a corkscrew wig.\" Some criticism of the film came in large part for the choice to have Angelina Jolie portraying Mariane Pearl in this manner. Defense of the casting choice was in large part due Pearl's mixed racial heritage, critics claimed it would have been impossible to find an Afro-Latina actress with the same crowd drawing caliber of Angelina Jolie. Director Michael Winterbottom defended his casting choice in an interview, \"To try and find a French actress who's half-Cuban, quarter-Chinese, half-Dutch who speaks great English and could do that part better – I mean, if there had been some more choices, I might have thought, 'Why don't we use that person?' ... I don't think there would have been anyone better.\"\n\nA 2008 imitation of Barack Obama by comedian Fred Armisen (of Venezuelan and Korean descent) on the popular television program \"Saturday Night Live\" caused some stir, with \"The Guardian's\" commentator openly asking why \"SNL\" did not hire an additional black actor to do the sketch; the show had only one black cast member at the time.\n\nIn the November 2010 episode \"Dee Reynolds: Shaping America's Youth\", the TV show \"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia\" comically explored if blackface could ever be done \"right\". One of the characters insists that Laurence Olivier's blackface performance in his 1965 production of \"Othello\" was not offensive. In the same episode, the gang shows their fan film, \"Lethal Weapon 5\", in which the character Mac appears in blackface. In the season 9 episode \"The Gang make Lethal Weapon 6\", Mac once again dons black make-up, along with Dee, who plays his character's wife in the film.\n\nThe 2012 Popchips commercial showing actor Ashton Kutcher with brown make-up on his face impersonating a stereotypical Indian person generated a storm of controversy and was eventually pulled by the company after complaints of racism. In the TV series \"Mad Men\", set in the 1960s in New York City, the character Roger Sterling appears in blackface in the season 3 episode \"My Old Kentucky Home\". Robert Downey Jr. appeared in a satirical role as a white Australian actor donning blackface in \"Tropic Thunder\". Julianne Hough attracted controversy in October 2013 when she donned blackface as part of a Halloween costume depicting the character of \"Crazy Eyes\" from \"Orange Is the New Black\". Hough later apologized, stating on Twitter: \"I realize my costume hurt and offended people and I truly apologize.\"\n\nBilly Crystal impersonated Sammy Davis Jr. in the 2012 Oscars opening montage. The scene depicts Crystal in black face paint wearing an oiled wave wig while talking to Justin Bieber. In the scene Crystal leaves a parting remark to Bieber, \"Have fun storming the Führer,\" a poor association to his famous line in The Princess Bride \"Have fun storming the castle.\"\nThe skit was remarked as poor taste, considering he was chosen as the \"safer\" choice after Eddie Murphy bowed out following producer and creative partner Brett Ratner's homophobic remarks.\n\nComedian Paul Scheer tweeted \"Octavia Spencer's win shows just how far we've come since Billy Crystal performed in Blackface. #TheOscars\" \n\nVictoria Foyt was accused of using blackface in the trailer for her young adult novel \"\" as well as in the book and its artwork. Gay white performer Chuck Knipp has used drag, blackface, and broad racial caricature while portraying a character named \"Shirley Q. Liquor\" in his cabaret act, generally performed for all-white audiences. Knipp's outrageously stereotypical character has drawn criticism and prompted demonstrations from black, gay and transgender activists. \"The Story of O.J\", a song on Jay-Z's \"\" album, has an accompanying music video which features an animated Jay-Z in exaggerated blackface.\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera, based in New York City used blackface in productions of the opera \"Otello\" until 2015, though some have argued that the practice of using dark makeup for the character did not qualify as blackface.\n\nIn November 2005, controversy erupted when journalist Steve Gilliard posted a photograph on his blog. The image was of African American Michael S. Steele, a politician, then a candidate for U.S. Senate. It had been doctored to include bushy, white eyebrows and big, red lips. The caption read, \"I's simple Sambo and I's running for the big house.\" Gilliard, also African-American, defended the image, commenting that the politically conservative Steele has \"refused to stand up for his people.\" (See .)\n\nBlackface performances are not unusual within the Latino community of Miami. As Spanish-speakers from different countries, ethnic, racial, class, and educational blackgrounds settle in the United States, they have to grapple with being re-classified vis-a-vis other American-born and immigrant groups. Blackface performances have, for instance, tried to work through U.S. racial and ethnic classifications in conflict with national identities. A case in point is the representation of Latino and its popular embodiment as a stereotypical Dominican man.\n\nSoviet writers and illustrators, while substantially ahead of their mainstream European and North American counterparts in condemning racism and colonialism and promoting the ideas of internationalism, sometimes inadvertently perpetuated stereotypes about other nations that are now viewed as harmful. For example, a Soviet children's book or cartoon might innocently contain a representation of black people that would be perceived as unquestionably offensive by the modern-day western standards, such as bright red lips and other exaggerated features, unintentionally similar to the portrayal of blacks in American minstrel shows. Soviet artists \"did not quite understand the harm of representing black people in this way, and continued to employ this method, even in creative productions aimed specifically at critiquing American race relations\".\n\nThe early Soviet political cartoon \"Black and White\", created in 1932, managed to avoid the blackface style, confronting \"precisely that paternalistic model of the ever-passive black subject awaiting enlightenment from the Comintern\". The cartoon integrated \"an avant-garde-influenced visual aesthetic with images derived from the many newspaper illustrations, cartoons, and posters of American racism that appeared in Soviet Russia at this time\".\n\nSoviet theater and movie directors rarely had access to black actors, and so resorted to using black makeup when dictated by the character's descent. Soviet actors portrayed black people mostly by darkening the skin and occasionally adjusting the hair style, without accentuating or exaggerating their facial features. In particular, Vladimir Vysotsky performed the role of Abram Petrovich Gannibal, an 18th century Russian general of African origin, in the 1976 Soviet film \"How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor\", while Larisa Dolina performed the role of Cuban singer Clementine Fernandez in the 1983 film \"We Are from Jazz\". The 1956 Soviet film adaptation of Othello received the Best Director Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nBlackface minstrelsy was the conduit through which African-American and African-American-influenced music, comedy, and dance first reached the white American mainstream. It played a seminal role in the introduction of African-American culture to world audiences.\n\nMany of country's earliest stars, such as Jimmie Rodgers\nand Bob Wills, were veterans of blackface performance. More recently, the American country music television show \"Hee Haw\" (1969–1993) had the format and much of the content of a minstrel show.\n\nThe immense popularity and profitability of blackface were testaments to the power, appeal, and commercial viability of not only black music and dance, but also of black style. This led to cross-cultural collaborations, as Giddins writes; but the often ruthless exploitation of African-American artistic genius, as well – by other, white performers and composers; agents; promoters; publishers; and record company executives.\n\nWhile blackface in the literal sense has played only a minor role in entertainment in recent decades, various writers see it as epitomizing an appropriation and imitation of black culture that continues today. As noted above, Strausbaugh sees blackface as central to a longer tradition of \"displaying Blackness\". \"To this day,\" he writes, \"Whites admire, envy and seek to emulate such supposed innate qualities of Blackness as inherent musicality, natural athleticism, the composure known as 'cool' and superior sexual endowment,\" a phenomemon he views as part of the history of blackface. For more than a century, when white performers have wanted to appear sexy, (like Elvis or Mick Jagger); or streetwise, (like Eminem); or hip, (like Mezz Mezzrow); they often have turned to African-American performance styles, stage presence and personas. Pop culture referencing and cultural appropriation of African-American performance and stylistic traditions is a tradition with origins in blackface minstrelsy.\n\nThis \"browning\", à la Richard Rodriguez, of American and world popular culture began with blackface minstrelsy. It is a continuum of pervasive African-American influence which has many prominent manifestations today, among them the ubiquity of the cool aesthetic and hip hop culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They were popular in the early 1990s and come in varied colors, including a see-through light-up one and a mini version. Some are available in key clip form under the name Bumble Ball Jr. Variations were produced by Ertl such as the Bumble Ball Bolter, a colorful insect-like toy with several long legs, a head with synthetic blue hair, and a Bumble Ball torso.\n\nThe toy is powered by a motor box with batteries mounted eccentrically. Its power switch consists of a knob that starts the motor when pushed in and stops the motor when pulled out. This causes it to vibrate and bounce about, some play music such as the wipe out song, appealing for both infants and elder toy enthusiasts. The core of the Bumble Ball is hard plastic while the knobs are a more rubbery texture.\n\nSilver Bumble Balls were seen in Michael Jackson's 1995 music video for his hit single, \"Scream.\" Despite fan requests, this special ball was never made available to the public.\n\nSince their early popularity in the 1990s, the Bumble Ball concept has been used by Fisher-Price. This has led to products more directly aimed toward toddlers such as a Mr. Potato Head-like toy and animal variations. These small versions use a pull-string to activate the vibration rather than a switch as featured on larger models.\n\nIn 2006 on \"Animal Planet\", footage of a dog (possibly an Irish Setter) with a Bumble Ball in its mouth has become a running gag where the host Keegan-Michael Key or the announcer would call it a \"Jowl Jiggler.\"\n"}

{"id": "6251777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6251777", "title": "Deletion (music industry)", "text": "Deletion (music industry)\n\nDeletion is a music industry term referring to the removal of a record or records from a label's official catalog, so that it is out of print, but usually at a record artist's request.\n\nDeletion can be for a variety of reasons, but usually reflects a decline in sales so that distributing the record is no longer profitable. Singles are routinely deleted after a period of weeks, but an album by a major artist may remain in the catalog indefinitely.\n\nWhen titles are deleted in the US, the remaining stock would be defaced with a cut-out through the sleeve or case. Cut-out records formed a grey market outside the major distribution channels. In the 1993 book \"Stiffed: A True Story of MCA, the Music Business, and the Mafia\" Bill Knoedelseder wrote of how MCA Records became the subject of a federal investigation of its cut-out sales practices after a deal allegedly involving organized crime.\n\nDeletion in the music industry differs from print publishing in that recording contracts generally do not return the rights to the artist when a title ceases to be manufactured. When PolyGram took over JMT Records, a small jazz label, in 1995, it was understood to have announced that the entire JMT catalogue would be deleted, shocking dozens of artists. According to Tim Berne, \"this means that the majority of my work simply vanishes.\"\n\nAccording to Louis Barfe, \"many deleted gems are locked in archives, unheard and quite possibly deteriorating.\" Although he recommends that they digitize this music and offer it for download, he notes that \"niche labels have sprung up specialising in reissuing out-of-copyright recordings\". Some bootlegs have been issued just so fans can obtain deleted recordings without having to search the second hand market for them.\n\nMore recently, the rise of digital media has eliminated much of the cost of music distribution, and companies have begun to see deleted records for their long tail potential, selling via iTunes and other online means. A single company, ArkivMusic, has struck deals with all four major publishers (and numerous minor ones) of classical music recordings to make their deleted records available via a burn-on-demand service.\n\nA prominent exception to the practice was the label Folkways Records, whose founder Moe Asch \"never deleted a single title from the ... catalogue\". According to Asch, \"Just because the letter J is less popular than the letter S, you don't take it out of the dictionary.\" When the label was disbanded, Asch enlisted the Smithsonian Institution to maintain the catalogue \"in perpetuity\".\n\n\"Scott 4\" was released late in 1969, the same year as \"Scott 3\". It was credited as being by Noel Scott Engel. It failed to chart and as a result, the album was deleted soon after release. \nIn July 1972, the British music paper, \"Melody Maker\", reported that a cutprice LP issued by Virgin Records was facing deletion because, ironically, it was too popular. Faust's \"The Faust Tapes\", then at number 18 in \"Melody Maker\"s chart, actually cost more to produce than its selling price (49p) and so Virgin lost supposedly £2,000 on sales of 60,000. It has since been argued that this move was merely a publicity stunt by Virgin's owner, Richard Branson.\n\nIn 1990, Arista Records deleted Milli Vanilli's album \"Girl You Know It's True\" very quickly after Frank Farian admitted that Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan did not sing on the record.\n\nThe British duo The KLF summarily deleted their entire back catalogue when they 'retired' from the music industry in 1992.\n\nManic Street Preachers' 2000 single \"The Masses Against The Classes\" was deleted on day of release as a promotional gimmick. This allowed it to reach Number 1 in the charts and remained in the charts for 7 weeks. However, copies of the single continued to be available until supplies ran out, making second hand copies plentiful.\n\nThe 2006 Gnarls Barkley single \"Crazy\" was deleted by Warner Music after six weeks at #1 in the UK as a deliberate move to protect it from overexposure. Deleted singles could not then remain on the UK Singles Chart, so the physical single no longer charted after two weeks. However, it remained as a high-selling download single and has continued to receive heavy airplay well after the single was deleted.\n\nOn 20 April 2013, Dutch composer John Ewbank deleted his song \"Koningslied\" (\"The King's Song\") only two days after its initial release, citing an overload of criticism aimed at him personally and at the song itself from the general public and the media. The song had been commissioned to act as the official song of Willem Alexander, Prince of Orange's upcoming investiture as the new King of the Netherlands on 30 April 2013. The song, already at number one in the iTunes download charts on the day of its release, was performed by a large number of well known Dutch artists.\n\n"}

The role of audiographer and the title \"director of audiography\" derives from Bollywood-style filmmaking in India, where it is an established title credit.\nThe DA works to carry out the director's vision, identifies the tasks necessary to realize this vision, budgets for those tasks and coordinates all the work from pre-production to post-production whilst keeping an eye on overall sound quality.\n\nSince the onset of the \"talkies\", a creative and professional conflict has emerged from the ongoing tension between the visual and aural dimensions of film. Production sound crews often complain about the lack of consideration given to sound on film productions.\n\nIn the early days of the Hollywood studio system, every studio had a sound director (SD) or a recording director (RD), who headed the sound department and took sole credit for the work done by a large crew of sound technicians.\n\nFollowing the demise of the studio system and the loss of the sound director, part of this role was delegated to the post-production supervisor, supervising sound editor, sound designer or production sound mixer - each role allegedly having less influence, responsibility and scope than the former SD. Where no DA is hired - as is the case when making films in the West - there has been some debate on the most appropriate role to head the sound department; a supervising sound editor is seen as a technical manager - comparable to an art director - whereas a sound designer is viewed as a creative visionary, analogous to a production designer. \nIn practice, the industry sees both roles as equivalent.\n\nThe DA should not be confused with a production supervisor or post-production supervisor - both are administrative roles in the production department. In contrast, the DA is a technical role blending leadership, management and administrative skills with creative audiography ranging over pre-production, production and post-production - constrained only by the Director's vision and the production's schedule and budget. In many ways the DoA role is a natural extension of the more limited post-production role of supervising sound editor.\n\nThe term director of sound (DoS) has also been proposed as an alternative title to that of DA.\n"}

It was the second animated spin-off of the sitcom \"Gilligan's Island\" (the first being \"The New Adventures of Gilligan\").\n\n\"Gilligan's Planet\" was the last cartoon series that Filmation produced for Saturday mornings; afterwards, they transitioned from Saturday Mornings to producing cartoons exclusively for syndication. It was also the first Filmation series to feature the Lou Scheimer \"signature\" credit (as opposed to the rotating Lou Scheimer/Norm Prescott \"wheel\" credit which had been used since 1969). In addition, it was one of the last 1980s Saturday morning cartoons to be fitted with an adult laugh track, as the popularity of the practice had subsided.\n\n\"Gilligan's Planet\" featured all of the original actors but one; Tina Louise, who has consistently refused to participate in any \"Gilligan's Island\"-related material since the series ended, again declined to reprise her role as Ginger Grant. Dawn Wells, who had been unavailable during the production of \"The New Adventures of Gilligan\", returned to the franchise, voicing both her own character (Mary Ann Summers) and Ginger.\n\n\"Gilligan's Planet\" is based on the premise that the Professor had managed to build an operational interplanetary spaceship to get the castaways of the original series off the island. (At least, the series thus disregards two of the three television movies made after the series ended, which had integrated the cast back into society.) True to the castaways' perpetual bad luck, they rocketed off into space and crash-landed on an unknown planet that supported human life. In many ways, the planet was like the island, but with a strangely colored and cratered surface with more land to get around. The rocket was severely damaged in the crash; thus, the castaways were still stranded and the Professor resumed his attempts to repair their only way home.\n\nOverall, \"Gilligan's Planet\" represented the source material of the original live-action series with \"space\" and \"alien\" themes. Encounters with \"headhunters\" and other shipwrecked people became encounters with alien creatures. A new character named Bumper was added, who appeared as a reptilian alien pet/sidekick for Gilligan and company.\n\n\nOn July 22, 2014, Warner Archive released \"Gilligan's Planet: The Complete Series\" on DVD in region 1 as part of their Warner Archive Collection.

Often scenes are shot quickly in real locations without any warning, and without obtaining filming permits.\n\nGuerrilla filmmaking is usually done by independent filmmakers because they don't have the budget or time to obtain permits, rent out locations, or build expensive sets. Larger and more \"mainstream\" film studios tend to avoid guerrilla filmmaking tactics because of the risk of being sued, fined or having their reputation damaged due to negative PR publicity.\n\nAccording to Yukon Film Commission Manager Mark Hill, \"Guerrilla filmmaking is driven by passion with whatever means at hand\".\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" characterized Ed Wood as a guerrilla filmmaker. As depicted in the biopic \"Ed Wood\", Wood stole a fake octopus for one of the scenes in his low budget films.\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert described \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\", directed by Melvin Van Peebles, as \"a textbook on guerrilla filmmaking\" in his review of \"Baadasssss!\", a biopic about the making of \"Sweet Sweetback\". Ben Sisario of \"The New York Times\" called Van Peebles \"a hero of guerrilla filmmaking\" who has suffered for his uncompromising vision.\n\nSpike Lee's \"She's Gotta Have It\" was a guerrilla film on a budget of $175,000 which made $7,137,502 at the box office. It was Spike Lee's first feature-length film and inspired him to write the book \"Spike Lee's Gotta Have It: Inside Guerrilla Filmmaking\".\n\nNew Queer Cinema director Gregg Araki shot his first two films, \"Three Bewildered People in the Night\" (1987) and \"The Long Weekend (O' Despair)\" (1989) using a spring-wound Bolex camera and scrap film stock, on a budget of $5,000 each.\n\nRobert Rodriguez shot the action film \"El Mariachi\" in Spanish. \"El Mariachi\", which was shot for around $7,000 with money partially raised by volunteering in medical research studies, won the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 1992. The film, originally intended for the Spanish-language low-budget home-video market, was distributed by Columbia Pictures in the United States. Rodriguez described his experiences making the film in his book \"Rebel Without a Crew\". The book and film would inspire other filmmakers to pick up cameras and make no-budget movies.\n\n\"Pi\", directed by Darren Aronofsky, was made on a budget of $68,000. It proved to be a financial success at the box office ($4.6 million gross worldwide). Aronofsky raised money for the project by selling $100 shares in the film to family and friends, and was able to pay them all back with a $50 profit per-share when the film was sold to Artisan.\n\nTroma Entertainment is a film production and distribution company founded by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz in 1974. The company produces low-budget independent films, many of which have developed cult followings. Kaufman has been outspoken about their use of guerrilla marketing and tolerance of piracy, and he has written the books \"All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from the Toxic Avenger\" and \"Make Your Own Damn Movie!\", which outline his philosophy of quick and inexpensive independent film.\n\n\"Paranormal Activity\", directed by first time director Oren Peli, was shot for approximately $10,000. Michael Cieply of \"The New York Times\" described the production and release as \"guerrilla style\". After being well received at film festivals, Paramount put the film on a tour where fans could request a screening.\n\n\"Escape From Tomorrow\", made for $650,000, was \"shot in a guerrilla-style manner at Walt Disney World and Disneyland without the permission of the parks,\" according to Jason Guerrasio of Indiewire. The film was originally expected to not be released due to fears of a lawsuit from Disney, but it was released on video on demand in October 2013.\n\n\"' was a 2012 gonzo journalism-styled mockumentary about an amateur filmmaker documenting a Philadelphian eccentric artist and his creative process. The guerrilla-style techniques implemented were used as part of the story itself, to represent the amateur production within the story. It was shot with a budget of less than $3,000 with a Canon XL2 and a Panasonic AG-DVX100. The director opted out of using a steadicam purposefully to achieve more shakiness. It was awarded Outstanding Lead Actor in a comedy or mockumentary by The 2013 LA Web Series Festival and deemed \"a gonzomentary truly realized\" by Mark Bell of \"Film Threat\".\n\n\"Midnight Rider\", a biopic of Gregg Allman, attempted to use guerilla filmmaking methods to illegally film a sequence on a railroad bridge in active use. A train coming shattered a metal bed placed on the tracks, killing camera operator Sarah Jones. Director Randall Miller was sentenced to two years imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter while producer Jay Sedrish received a suspended sentence of ten years' probation. Both were prohibited from working in any directorial or safety-related role for a decade.\n\n\"Super Demetrios\" (2011), the first Greek superhero film, made on a budget of €2,000, won the audience award at the 52nd Thessaloniki International Film Festival with the highest number of votes in the history of the festival and became an instant cult classic, \"proving that Greek guerrilla cinema can survive without state funding injections\" according to Giannis Zoumboulakis of \"To Vima\" newspaper.\n\nThe advent of digital cameras and home computer editing systems such as Final Cut Pro, Avid Media Composer and Premiere Pro are a contributing factor to the increase in guerrilla filmmaking. Digital editing is a cheap and easy form of editing that allows the filmmaker to edit anywhere and at a low budget.\n\nMany guerrilla filmmakers are now using professional quality digital cameras because of their cheap cost, and the ability to set up shots quickly.\n\n\n"}

Marin starring George Raft, June Havoc and Helena Carter. It was the first of two films Raft made for his own production company, Star Films, with producer Sam Bischoff. \nIn post-war China, court-martialed pilot Brad Dunham (George Raft) now flies smuggled goods into the country. He attempts to force his immediate superior, Ramon Perez (Marvin Miller), to pay him more, but Perez resists, so Brad steals the cargo back.\n\nThe boss of the black-market operation is Tamara Baranoff (June Havoc), who agrees to Brad's demand of a 50% cut of the operation and fires Ramon as a show of good faith. Meanwhile, an American newspaper reporter, Marc Andrews (Tom Tully), a friend of Brad's, shows up in Shanghai to investigate black-market crime.\n\nBrad meets a social worker, Linda Arnold (Helena Carter]), and their friendship makes Tamara jealous. She insists that Brad do something about the prying reporter and steer clear of that other woman. Tamara's criminal rival tips off Marc that his pal Brad is involved with the crime ring.\n\nMarc is knifed by Tamara's rival just as he is delivering a copy of his story exposing the black market. His dying wish is that Brad deliver the story for him, telling Brad that it was Tamara whose testimony led to Brad's unjust court-martial.\n\nBrad distributes her black-market goods to needy citizens. Ramon turns up to ambush Brad, but his gun goes off, killing Tamara instead, and Ramon is placed under arrest. Brad and Linda contemplate a new life together.\n\nThe film was based on a story by George Slavin. Film rights were bought by Sam Bischoff, who had formed a company with George Raft. It was the second of a four picture deal Bischoff had with United Artists after \"Pitfall\". The other pictures in the deal were to star Raft. Edwin Marin signed to direct. Bischoff had a credit line of $5 million to make the movies.\n\nThe plot was originally meant to involve smuggling blood plasma, but this was changed to whisky and cigarettes at the request of Chinese-American organizations. Raft regretted this change. Principal photography took place from April 28 to mid-June 1947.\n\nFilming started 28 April 1947. It was June Havoc's first film since 1944.\n\nRaft was hospitalised with illness during the shoot.\n\nIn his review of \"Intrigue\" for \"The New York Times\", Thomas M. Pryor considered the film a \"conventional exercise in screen melodramatics \" and George Raft's role as \"... all so much wasted effort on his part for no one could possibly inject any semblance of verisimilitude into the hopeless botch of incident \"[sic]\" which Barry Trivers and George Slavin set to paper under the impression that they were writing a screen play.\"\n\nOn May 10, 1948, George Raft and June Havoc reprised their film roles in a 60-minute radio adaptation of the film for a \"Lux Radio Theater\" broadcast.\n\n"}

The franchise originated with a film trilogy, later expanded to a trilogy of trilogies. The original trilogy was released between 1977 and 1983, the prequel trilogy between 1999 and 2005, and a sequel trilogy began in 2015. Theatrical films, television specials and TV series are set between the main films. There have been a few animated \"Star Wars\" series, and the first live-action series will be released in 2019.\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" film series centers around a \"trilogy of trilogies\" (also referred to as the \"Skywalker saga\" or the \"\"Star Wars\" saga\"). They were released out of sequence: the original (Episodes \"IV–VI\", 1977–83), prequel (Episodes \"I–III\", 1999–2005), and sequel (Episodes \"VII–IX\", 2015–19) trilogy. The first two trilogies were released on three year intervals, the sequel trilogy films two years apart. Each trilogy centers on a generation of the Force-sensitive Skywalker family. The prequels focus on Anakin Skywalker, the original trilogy on his son Luke, and the sequels on Luke's nephew Kylo Ren.\n\nSeveral spin-off films have been released theatrically. An animated film, \"\" (2008), was released as a pilot to a . An anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in parallel to the production of the sequel trilogy, described by Disney CFO Jay Rasulo as \"origin stories\". The first entry, \"Rogue One\" (2016), tells the story of the rebels who steal the Death Star plans directly before \"Episode IV\". \"\" (2018) focuses on Han's backstory, also featuring Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian.\n\nTwo spin-off film series are planned, an untitled trilogy by 's director Rian Johnson has been announced, with an additional film series by \"Game of Thrones\" creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss also in development. \n\n<onlyinclude>\n\n</onlyinclude>\nThe episodic films begin with an opening crawl, accompanied by the main \"Star Wars\" theme by John Williams, who composes the scores for each film. Some of the films have had retroactive changes made after their initial releases, most notably the original trilogy.\n\nImmediately after directing \"American Graffiti\" (1973), Lucas wrote a two-page synopsis for the space opera he had been planning, which 20th Century Fox invested in. Lucas expanded his treatment into an overview called \"The Star Wars\", and by 1974, he had written the screenplay's first draft. Lucas negotiated to retain the sequel rights, and casted \"American Graffiti\" actor Harrison Ford as Han Solo.\n\n\"Star Wars\" was released on May 25, 1977, followed by \"The Empire Strikes Back\" on May 21, 1980, and \"Return of the Jedi\" on May 25, 1983. The plot of the original trilogy centers on the Galactic Civil War of the Rebel Alliance trying to free the galaxy from the clutches of the Galactic Empire, as well as on Luke Skywalker's quest to become a Jedi.\n\nThe original \"Star Wars\" film opens with a Rebel spaceship being intercepted by the Empire above the desert planet of Tatooine. Aboard, the deadliest Imperial agent Darth Vader and his stormtroopers capture Princess Leia Organa, a secret member of the rebellion. Before her capture, Leia makes sure the droid R2-D2 will escape with stolen Imperial blueprints and a holographic message for the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has been living in exile on Tatooine. Along with , R2-D2 falls under the ownership of Luke Skywalker, a farmboy who has been raised by his aunt and uncle. Luke helps the droids locate Obi-Wan, now a solitary old hermit known as Ben Kenobi. He reveals himself as a friend of Luke's absent father, Anakin Skywalker, who was Obi-Wan's Jedi apprentice until being murdered by Vader. He tells Luke he must also become a Jedi. After discovering his family's homestead has been destroyed by the Empire, they hire the smuggler Han Solo, his Wookiee Chewbacca and their space freighter, the \"Millennium Falcon\". They discover that Leia's homeworld of Alderaan has been destroyed, and are soon captured by the planet-destroying Death Star. While Obi-Wan disables its tractor beam, Luke and Han rescue the captive Princess Leia. Finally, they deliver the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance with the hope of exploiting a weakness.\nThe first rough draft, titled \"The Star Wars\", introduced \"the Force\" and the young hero Luke Starkiller. Annikin appeared as Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight. The third draft replaced (a deceased) Annikin with Ben Kenobi. Some months later, Lucas had negotiated a contract that gave him rights to two sequels. Lucas hired Alan Dean Foster, who was ghostwriting the , to write them — with the main creative restriction that they could be filmed on a low budget. By 1976, a fourth draft had been prepared for principal photography. The film was titled \"The Adventures of Luke Starkiller, as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars\". During production, Lucas changed Luke's name to Skywalker and shortened the title to \"The Star Wars\", and finally just \"Star Wars\". At that point, Lucas was not expecting the film to warrant full-scale sequels. The fourth draft of the script underwent subtle changes to become a self-contained story ending with the destruction of the Empire in the Death Star. The intention was that if the film was successful, Lucas could adapt Foster's novels into low-budget sequels. By that point, Lucas had developed a tentative backstory to aid in developing the saga.\n\"Star Wars\" exceeded all expectations. The success of the film and its merchandise sales led Lucas to make \"Star Wars\" the basis of an elaborate film serial, and use the profits to finance his filmmaking center, Skywalker Ranch. After the release of the first sequel, the original film was subtitled \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" for a rerelease in 1981.\n\nSet three years after the destruction of the Death Star, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" begins with the Empire forcing the Rebel Alliance to evacuate its secret base on Hoth. Instructed by Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke travels to the swamp world of Dagobah to find the exiled Jedi Master Yoda. Luke's Jedi training is interrupted by Vader, who lures him into a trap by capturing Han and Leia at Cloud City, governed by Han's old friend Lando. During a fierce duel, Vader reveals a shocking truth about Luke's father.\n\nOwing to financial concerns, Alan Dean Foster's sequel novel, \"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\" (1978), restricted the story to Luke, Leia, and Darth Vader. But after the success of the original film, Lucas knew a sequel would be granted a reasonable budget, and hired Leigh Brackett to write it from scratch. She finished a draft by early 1978, but died of cancer before Lucas was able discuss changes he wanted made to it. His disappointment with the first draft may have made him consider new directions. Lucas penned the next draft, the first screenplay to feature episodic numbering for a \"Star Wars\" story. Lucas found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the yearlong struggle writing the first film, and quickly wrote two more in April 1978. The plot twist of Vader being Luke's father had drastic effects on the series. After writing these drafts, Lucas fleshed out the backstory between Anakin, Obi-Wan, and the Emperor.\n\nWith this new backstory in place, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies, designating the first sequel \"Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\" in the next draft. Lawrence Kasdan, who had just completed writing \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", was hired to write the next drafts, and given additional input from director Irvin Kershner. Kasdan, Kershner, and producer Gary Kurtz saw the film as a more serious and adult story, and developed the sequel from the light adventure roots of the first film.\n\nSet less than one year after Vader's revelation, \"Return of the Jedi\" sees Luke joining Leia and Lando in a rescue attempt to save Han from the gangster Jabba the Hutt. Afterward, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training, only to find Yoda on his deathbed. In his last words, Yoda confirms the truth about Luke's father, and that Luke must confront Vader again in order to complete his training. As the rebels lead an attack on the second Death Star, Luke engages Vader in another lightsaber duel as Emperor Palpatine watches; both Sith Lords intend to turn Luke to the dark side and take him as their apprentice.\nKurtz wanted a bittersweet and nuanced ending they had outlined that saw Han dead, the Rebel forces in pieces, Leia struggling as a queen, and Luke walking off alone (like in a Spaghetti Western)—while Lucas wanted a happier ending, partly to encourage toy sales. This led to tension between the two, resulting in Kurtz leaving the production.\n\nLoose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original trilogy. Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery, inspired him to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga.\n\nThe prequel trilogy consists of \"\", released on May 19, 1999; \"\", released on May 16, 2002; and \"\", released on May 19, 2005. The plot focuses on the fall of the Galactic Republic, as well as the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side.\n\nSet 32 years before the original film, \"\" begins with two Jedi who, acting as negotiators of the Republic, discover that the corrupt Trade Federation has formed a blockade around the planet Naboo. Sith Lord Darth Sidious has secretly caused the blockade to give his alter ego, Senator Palpatine, a pretense to overthrow and replace the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, encounter a native of Naboo who helps them find the Queen of Naboo. With Queen Padmé Amidala, they escape the blockade, but not without their starship being damaged. Landing on Tatooine for repairs, they meet a nine-year-old slave named Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon helps liberate the boy by betting with his master in a podrace, believing him to be the \"Chosen One\" prophesied by the Jedi to bring balance to the Force. Sidious dispatches his Sith apprentice, Darth Maul, to attack the Queen's Jedi protectors. Arriving on Coruscant so the Queen can plead Naboo's crisis before the Republic Senate, Anakin is brought before the Jedi Council, where Yoda senses that he possesses too much fear.\n\nThe prequels were originally planned to fill in history tangential to the original trilogy, but Lucas realized that they could form the first half of one long story focusing on Anakin. This would shape the film series into a self-contained saga. In 1994, Lucas began writing the screenplay for the first prequel, initially titled \"Episode I: The Beginning\". Following the film's release, Lucas announced that he would be directing the next two.\n\nTen years after the Battle of Naboo, \"\" opens with an assassination attempt upon former Queen Padmé Amidala, who is serving as the Senator of Naboo. Obi-Wan and his apprentice Anakin are assigned to protect her; Obi-Wan tracks the killer, while Anakin and Padmé retreat to Naboo. They soon fall in love with each other, albeit secretly due to the Jedi Order's rule against attachment. Meanwhile, Chancellor Palpatine schemes to draw the entire galaxy into the \"Clone War\" between the Republic army led by the Jedi, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems led by Count Dooku (the former master of Obi-Wan's deceased master Qui-Gon, and Palpatine's new Sith apprentice).\n\nThe first draft of \"Episode II\" was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired Jonathan Hales, a writer from \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\", to polish it. Unsure of a title, Lucas had jokingly called the film \"Jar Jar's Great Adventure\". In writing \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Lucas initially considered that Lando Calrissian was a clone from a planet of clones which caused the Clone Wars mentioned in \"A New Hope\". He later came up with the concept of an army of clone shock troopers from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and were resisted by the Jedi.\n\n\"\" begins three years into the Clone Wars, with Anakin and Obi-Wan leading a rescue mission to save Chancellor Palpatine from Count Dooku and the droid commander General Grievous. Anakin begins to have prophetic visions of his secret wife Padmé dying in childbirth. Palpatine, who had been secretly engineering the Clone Wars to destroy the Jedi Order, convinces Anakin that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save Padmé's life. Desperate, Anakin submits to Palpatine and is renamed Darth Vader. Palpatine orders the clone army to fire on their Jedi generals, and declares the former Republic an Empire. Vader participates in the extermination of the Jedi, culminating in a lightsaber duel with Obi-Wan on the volcanic planet Mustafar.\n\nWork on \"Episode III\" began before \"Episode II\" was released, with one scene shot during the earlier film's production. Lucas originally told concept artists that the film would open with a montage of the Clone Wars, and included a scene of Palpatine revealing to Anakin that he had willed his conception through the Force. Lucas reviewed and radically reorganized the plot, having Anakin execute Dooku in the first act to foreshadow his fall to the dark side. After principal photography was completed in 2003, Lucas made more changes, rewriting Anakin's arc. He would now primarily turn to the dark side in a quest to save Padmé, rather than just believing that the Jedi are plotting to take over the Republic. The rewrite was accomplished both through editing principal footage, and filming new and revised scenes during pick-ups in 2004.\n\nPrior to releasing the original film, Lucas planned \"three trilogies of nine films,\" but after beginning work on the prequels, insisted that \"Star Wars\" was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy. However, in late 2012, Disney agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced a new trilogy, beginning with \"Episode VII\" in 2015.\n\nThe sequel trilogy focuses on the journey of the orphaned scavenger Rey following in the footsteps of the Jedi with the guidance of Luke Skywalker. Along with ex-stormtrooper Finn, she helps the Resistance led by Leia fight the First Order commanded by Supreme Leader Snoke and his pupil Kylo Ren (Han Solo and Leia's son). \"\" was released on December 18, 2015, \"\" on December 15, 2017, and \"Episode IX\" is due to be released on December 20, 2019.\n\n is set 30 years after the destruction of the second Death Star, by which time Luke Skywalker has gone missing. The remnants of the Empire have become the First Order, who seek to destroy Luke and the New Republic. They are opposed by the Resistance, led by princess-turned-general Leia Organa. On the planet of Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron obtains a map to Luke's location, but is captured by stormtroopers under the command of Kylo Ren. Poe's droid BB-8 escapes with the map, and encounters a scavenger girl, Rey. Kylo tortures Poe and learns of BB-8. A defecting stormtrooper frees Poe, who dubs him \"Finn\", and both escape in a TIE fighter. Poe is seemingly killed in a crash-landing upon Jakku. Finn finds Rey and BB-8, as the First Order pursues them; they escape together in the impounded \"Millennium Falcon\". The \"Falcon\" is recaptured by Han Solo and Chewbacca, working as smugglers again. They agree to help deliver the map inside BB-8 to the Resistance.\n\nIn early 2013, Walt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm officially announced J. J. Abrams as \"Star Wars Episode VII\"s director and producer, along with Bryan Burk and Bad Robot Productions. The screenplay for \"Episode VII\" was originally set to be written by Michael Arndt, but in October 2013 it was announced that writing duties would be taken over by Lawrence Kasdan and J. J. Abrams.\n\nAfter a battle scene which overlaps with the denouement of the previous film, \"\" follows Rey's attempt to convince Luke Skywalker to teach her the ways of the Force. She also seeks answers about her past and the conflict between Luke and his nephew Kylo Ren. Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey starts using the Force to communicate with Ren. Meanwhile, Leia leads Poe, Finn, Rose Tico, BB-8, and the rest of the Resistance as they are pursued by the First Order, led by Snoke with Kylo as his second in command. After hearing Ren's perspective, Rey disagrees with Luke and leaves him in an attempt to redeem Kylo and achieve peace. In doing this, Rey unwittingly helps Kylo kill Snoke. However, Ren's intentions are to replace Snoke as Supreme Leader, believing that destroying the Jedi and the Resistance is the only way to achieve peace. Rey must choose between Kylo's offer to rule the galaxy with him, or helping the outnumbered Resistance survive on Crait.\n\nIn late 2012, it was reported that Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg would write and produce Episodes \"VIII\" and \"IX\". Kasdan and Kinberg were later confirmed as consultants on those films. In addition, John Williams, who wrote the music for the previous six episodes, was hired to compose the music for Episodes \"VII\", \"VIII\" and \"IX\". On March 12, 2015, Lucasfilm announced that \"Looper\" director Rian Johnson would direct \"Episode VIII\" with Ram Bergman as producer for Ram Bergman Productions. When asked about \"Episode VIII\" in mid-2014, Johnson said \"I'm just happy. I don't have the terror I kind of expected I would... I'm sure I will at some point.\" Principal photography began in February 2016 and wrapped in July 2016. Carrie Fisher had finished filming her scenes, but died on December 27, 2016, approximately a year before the film's release.\n\nProduction on \"\" was scheduled to begin in 2017. Carrie Fisher was originally slated for a key role in the film, but after her death, her role had to be modified. In January 2017, Lucasfilm stated they would not digitally generate Fisher's performance for the film. In April 2017, Fisher's brother Todd and daughter Billie Lourd gave Disney permission to use unreleased footage from the first two films of the sequel trilogy. Principal photography of \"Star Wars: Episode IX\" began on August 1, 2018. J.J. Abrams returned to direct, and the film alongside Chris Terrio. Most of the cast of \"The Last Jedi\" is set to return, including \"Star Wars\" veterans Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels. They will be joined by Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, on screen for the first time since 1983's \"Return of the Jedi\".\n\nAs Lucas was outlining his trilogy of trilogies, he also imagined making \"a couple of odd movies ... [that] don't have anything to do with the \"Star Wars\" saga.\" The first theatrical films set outside the main episodic series were the Ewok spin-off films \"\" (1984) and \"\" (1985), which were screened internationally after being produced for television. Although based on story ideas from Lucas, they do not bear \"Star Wars\" in their titles, and were considered to exist in a lower level of canon than the episodic films.\n\nAfter the conclusion of his then six-episode saga in 2005, Lucas returned to spin-offs in the form of television series.\n\nPreceding the airing of in late 2008, the theatrical feature \"\" was compiled from episodes \"almost [as] an afterthought.\" It reveals that Anakin trained an apprentice between \"Attack of the Clones\" and \"Revenge of the Sith\"; the series explains Padawan Ahsoka Tano's absence from the latter film. The character was originally criticized by fans, but by the end of the series the character had become a fan favorite. The film and series exist in the same level of canon as the episodic and anthology films.\n\nBefore selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, and parallel to his development of a sequel trilogy, George Lucas and original trilogy Lawrence Kasdan started development on a standalone film about a young Han Solo. In February 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger made public the development of a Kasdan film and \"Entertainment Weekly\" reported that it would focus on Han Solo. Disney CFO Jay Rasulo has described the standalone films as origin stories. Kathleen Kennedy confirmed that there was \"no attempt being made to carry characters (from the standalone films) in and out of the saga episodes.\" The standalone films are subtitled \"A Star Wars Story\".\n\n\"Rogue One\" is set directly before \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" and focuses on the eponymous group of rebels who obtain the plans to the Death Star. Its laser was developed by scientist Galen Erso (played by Mads Mikkelsen) after the Empire forcibly abducted him, separating him from his daughter Jyn. Galen secretly sends a deflecting Imperial pilot to deliver a message warning of the weapon's existence and revealing its weakness to his rebel friend Saw Gerrera. Under the false promise of her father's liberation, Jyn agrees to use her ties to help the Rebel Alliance retrieve the message from Saw, now the paranoid leader of an extremist cell of rebels.\n\nThe idea for the movie came from John Knoll, the chief creative officer of Industrial Light & Magic. In May 2014, Lucasfilm announced Gareth Edwards as the director of an anthology film, with Gary Whitta writing the first draft for a release on December 16, 2016. The film's title was revealed to be \"Rogue One\", with Chris Weitz rewriting the script, and Felicity Jones in the starring role. Ben Mendelsohn and Diego Luna also play new characters, with James Earl Jones returning to voice Darth Vader. Edwards stated, \"It comes down to a group of individuals who don't have magical powers that have to somehow bring hope to the galaxy.\" The film was the first to feature characters introduced in animated \"Star Wars\" TV series, namely \"\"' Saw Gerrera, portrayed by Forest Whitaker. The movie received generally positive reviews, with its performances, action sequences, soundtrack, visual effects and darker tone being praised. The film grossed over million worldwide within a week of its release.\n\n\"\", the second anthology film, focuses on Han Solo before his appearance in the original trilogy. After an escape attempt from his Imperial-occupied home planet of Corellia goes wrong, a young Han vows to return to rescue his girlfriend Qi'ra. Han \"Solo\" joins the Imperial Academy; however, he is expelled for his reckless behavior. Han and his newfound Wookiee friend Chewbacca resort to a criminal life, mentored by veteran smuggler Beckett. After angering gangster Dryden Vos, Han and his company's lives depend on pulling a heist for him. Without a ship to travel, they hire Lando Calrissian, the captain and owner of the \"Millennium Falcon\". A twist ending reveals Vos' employer, acknowledging one of the major story arcs of \"The Clone Wars\".\n\nBefore selling Lucasfilm to Disney, George Lucas had hired \"Star Wars\" original trilogy veteran Lawrence Kasdan to write a film about a young Han Solo. The film stars Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo, Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca (after serving as a double for the character in \"The Force Awakens\" and \"The Last Jedi\"), Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian, Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra, and Woody Harrelson as Beckett. Lucasfilm originally hired Phil Lord and Christopher Miller to direct, but they were fired during principal photography, and replaced by Ron Howard.\n\nCritics noted the film was intentionally left open for sequels. Alden Ehrenreich confirmed his contractual obligation to play the character for two additional films. Emilia Clarke also signed on for the possible return of her character.\n\nIn early 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the development of a spin-off film written by Simon Kinberg, reported by \"Entertainment Weekly\" to focus on bounty hunter Boba Fett during the original trilogy. In mid-2014, Josh Trank was officially announced as the director of an undisclosed spin-off film, but had left the project a year later due to creative differences with Kinberg, causing a teaser for the Fett film to be scrapped from \"Star Wars\" Celebration. In May 2018, it was reported that James Mangold had signed on to write and direct a Fett film, with Kinberg attached as producer and . The author of a Fett-focused stated that Lucasfilm had considered adapting it into a film. However, by October, the Fett film was reportedly no longer in production, with the studio instead focusing on the upcoming \"The Mandalorian\" series, which utilizes a similar character design.\n\nIn August 2017, it was rumored that films focused on Jabba the Hutt, Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi were being considered or were in development. Stephen Daldry was reportedly in early negotiations to and direct the Obi-Wan movie. Ewan McGregor has expressed interest in reprising the role, but as of mid-2018 stated that he had no knowledge of such a project. However, former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was later quoted as saying the filmmakers of an Obi-Wan spin-off film had proposed shooting it in Northern Ireland.\n\nAn unannounced film centered around the Mos Eisley Spaceport was reportedly put on hold or cancelled in mid-2018, leading to rumors of the cancellation or postponement of the anthology series. Lucasfilm swiftly denied the rumors as \"inaccurate\", confirming that there are multiple unannounced films still in development. Kathleen Kennedy has expressed being open to making a Lando Calrissian film at some point, but confirmed that none was currently in development.\n\nIn November 2017, Lucasfilm announced that Rian Johnson, the writer/director of \"The Last Jedi\", would be working on a new trilogy. The films will reportedly differ from the Skywalker-focused films in favor of focusing on new characters. Johnson is confirmed to write and direct the first film.\n\nIn February 2018, it was announced that \"Game of Thrones\" creators David Benioff and would write and produce a series of \"Star Wars\" films that are not Skywalker-focused, similar to (but separate from) Rian Johnson's upcoming installments in the franchise.\n\nThe first six films of the \"Star Wars\" series were shot in an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, while the Disney-made films are shot in 2.40:1. The original and sequel trilogies were shot with anamorphic lenses. \"Episodes IV\", \"V\", and \"VII\" were shot in Panavision, while \"Episode VI\" was shot in Joe Dunton Camera (JDC) scope. \"Episode I\" was shot with Hawk anamorphic lenses on Arriflex cameras, and \"Episodes II\" and \"III\" were shot with Sony's CineAlta high-definition digital cameras.\n\nLucas hired Ben Burtt to oversee the sound effects on the original 1977 film. Burtt's accomplishment was such that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented him with a Special Achievement Award because it had no award at the time for the work he had done. Lucasfilm developed the THX sound reproduction standard for \"Return of the Jedi\". John Williams composed the scores for all eight films. Lucas's design for \"Star Wars\" involved a grand musical sound, with leitmotifs for different characters and important concepts. Williams's \"Star Wars\" title theme has become one of the most famous and well-known musical compositions in modern music history.\n\nLucas hired 'the Dean of Special Effects' John Stears, who created R2-D2, Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder, the Jedi Knights' lightsabers, and the Death Star. The technical lightsaber choreography for the original trilogy was developed by leading filmmaking sword-master Bob Anderson. Anderson trained actor Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and performed all the sword stunts as Darth Vader during the lightsaber duels in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\", wearing Vader's costume. Anderson's role in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy was highlighted in the film \"Reclaiming the Blade\", where he shares his experiences as the fight choreographer developing the lightsaber techniques for the movies.\n\n\"Star Wars\" is the second highest grossing film series of all time, behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThe nine live-action films together have been nominated for 33 Academy Awards, of which they won seven. The films were also awarded a total of three Special Achievement Awards. \"Star Wars\" received seven awards and four nominations, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" received one award, one Special Achievement Award and two nominations, \"Return of the Jedi\" received one Special Achievement Award and four nominations, \"The Phantom Menace\" received three nominations, \"Attack of the Clones\" and \"Revenge of the Sith\" received one nomination each, \"The Force Awakens\" received five nominations, \"Rogue One\" received two nominations and \"The Last Jedi\" received four nominations.\n\nFive films in the franchise (\"Return of the Jedi\", \"The Phantom Menace\", \"The Force Awakens\", \"Rogue One\" and \"The Last Jedi\") were nominated for Best Sound Mixing; two films (\"Star Wars\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\") won the award. Five films (\"The Phantom Menace\", \"Attack of the Clones\", \"The Force Awakens\", \"Rogue One\" and \"The Last Jedi\") were nominated for Best Visual Effects; \"Star Wars\" won the award, while \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\" received Special Achievement Awards for their visual effects and \"Star Wars\" received a Special Achievement Award for its alien, creature and robot voices. Four films (\"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Return of the Jedi\", \"The Force Awakens\" and \"The Last Jedi\") were nominated for Best Original Score; \"Star Wars\" won the award. \"The Force Awakens\" was nominated for Best Film Editing and \"Star Wars\" won the award. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\" were nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and \"Star Wars\" won the award. Four films (\"Return of the Jedi\", \"The Phantom Menace\", \"The Force Awakens\" and \"The Last Jedi\") were nominated for Best Sound Editing. \"Star Wars\" won Best Costume Design and it also received nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Alec Guinness), Best Director (George Lucas), Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. \"Revenge of the Sith\" received a nomination for Best Makeup.\nIn 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original \"Star Wars\" film for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry, as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" \"The Empire Strikes Back\", was selected in 2010. 35mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints, but it was later revealed that the Library possessed a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases. By 2015, \"Star Wars\" had been transferred to a 2K scan which can be viewed by appointment.\n\nThree live-action \"Star Wars\" spin-off films were created for television in the late 1970s and mid-1980s. The later two featured the Ewoks, which were also the focus of one of two animated series released in the mid-1980s. Further animated series began to be released in 2003, the first two of which focused on the Clone Wars. After Disney's acquisition of LucasFilm, only the later \"\" was kept in the canon of continuity of the episodic \"Star Wars\" films. Two additional half-hour animated series were ordered, one of which ties into the original trilogy, the other the sequel trilogy. Two live-action \"Star Wars\" series are currently in development for Disney+.\n\nA two-hour \"Holiday Special\" focusing on Chewbacca's family was produced for CBS in 1978. Along with the stars of the original film, celebrity guest stars appear in plot-related skits and musical numbers. Lucas loathed the special and forbade it to be reaired or released on home video. An 11-minute animated sequence features the first appearance of bounty hunter Boba Fett, and is considered the highlight of the special.\n\nThe Ewoks from \"Return of the Jedi\" were featured in two spin-off television films, \"\" and \"\". Both aired on ABC on the Thanksgiving weekends of 1984 and 1985, respectively. Warwick Davis reprised his debut role as the main Ewok, Wicket, in a story by Lucas and a screenplay by Bob Carrau. In the first film, the Towani family spaceship shipwrecks on the forest moon of Endor. While trying to repair their ship, the castaway family is split, when a giant creature known as the Gorax, kidnaps the parents. Taking pity on the kids, a group of native Ewoks led by Wicket decides to help little Cindel Towani and her older brother Mace, rescue their parents. Among other stylistic choices making the film unique from the \"Star Wars\" episodes is the inclusion of a narrator.\n\nThe sequel focuses on the Ewoks protecting their village from marauders led by the evil witch Tarak, who kills all the members of the Towani family except for Cindel. Both \"Ewoks\" films were released on VHS, Laser Disc, and DVD. However, since Disney's acquisition of the franchise, the \"Ewoks\" films have been excluded from the new canon.\n\nNelvana, the animation studio that had animated the animated segment of the \"Holiday Special\" was hired to create two animated series. \"\" (1985–1986), which aired for one season on ABC, follows the adventures of and R2-D2 before the events of \"A New Hope\". Its sister series \"Ewoks\" (1985–1987) features the Ewoks before \"Return of the Jedi\" and the Ewok movies.\n\nAfter the release of \"Attack of the Clones\", Cartoon Network produced and aired the micro-series \"\" from 2003 to weeks before the 2005 release of \"Revenge of the Sith\", as the series featured events set between those films. It won the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program in 2004 and 2005.\n\nLucas decided to invest in creating his own animation company, Lucasfilm Animation, and used it to create his first in-house \"Star Wars\" CGI-animated series. \"\" (2008–2014) was introduced through a . Both were accepted to the highest level canon in 2014; all series released afterwards would also be canon. The series started Dave Filoni's involvement in \"Star Wars\" animation projects, he has helped develop every other animated series related to the franchise since. After Disney's acquisition of the \"Star Wars\" franchise, \"The Clone Wars\" was abruptly cancelled in 2014, before it's intended final episodes were finished, leaving many unfinished episodes, some fully voiced and others even roughly animated. The series final season will be released in 2019, the series is set between \"Episode II\" and \"Episode III\" of the \"Skywalker Saga\", it focuses mainly on the film Jedi characters of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi, as well as Anakin's padawan apprentice Ahsoka Tano (an original character created by Lucas for the series), with other characters from the prequel trilogy in supporting roles.\n\nIn 2014, Disney XD began airing \"Star Wars Rebels\", the first CGI-animated series produced in the new era. Set between \"Revenge of the Sith\" and \"A New Hope\", it follows a band of rebels as they fight the Galactic Empire and helped close some of the arcs in \"The Clone Wars\". Due to the film \"Rogue One\" being produced at the same time, the film and the series acknowledged each other. The series also included a canonical version of Grand Admiral Thrawn, the character from the \"Legends \" Thrawn trilogy.\n\nThe animated micro-series \"Star Wars Forces of Destiny\" debuted in 2017, focusing on the female characters of the franchise.\n\nThe animated series \"Star Wars Resistance\" debuted in late 2018, is anime-inspired, and focuses on a young Resistance pilot before and during \"The Force Awakens\".\n\n\"Star Wars Galaxy of Adventures\" debuted on the \"Star Wars Kids\" YouTube channel and website in late 2018. Using stylized animation, the series of shorts recounts key scenes from the saga and will continue until the release of \"Episode IX\". The shorts feature audio from the original films and are animated by Titmouse, Inc.\n\n\"Star Wars Detours\" is an unaired animated parody series from the creators of \"Robot Chicken\", which was postponed in 2013 and ultimately unaired. Production began in 2012 prior to the Disney acquisition, with 39 episodes completed and 62 additional scripts finished.\n\nIn 2005, Lucas announced plans for a television series set between the prequel and original trilogies. In 2007, he described the project as \"one show that will split into four shows, focusing on different characters.\" Producer Rick McCallum revealed the working title, \"Star Wars: Underworld\", in 2012, and that it would focus on criminal and political power struggles in the \"period when the Empire is trying to take things over.\" 50 scripts were written, and the project was still being considered after Lucasfilm was sold to Disney, with stories being reviewed .\n\nIn November 2017, Bob Iger discussed the development of a \"Star Wars\" series for Disney's streaming service Disney+, due to launch in 2019. Multiple live-action TV series are in development, with noteworthy talent involved.\n\nJon Favreau, who previously voiced a character in \"The Clone Wars\", will write and produce a series set three years after \"Return of the Jedi\". It will feature motion capture and cost about \"$100 million for 10 episodes.\" It began filming in late 2018, and will focus on \"the travails of a lone gunfighter ... far from the authority of the New Republic.\" Dave Filoni will direct the first episode, and other directors include Taika Waititi and Bryce Dallas Howard. Pedro Pascal will play the series' titular character.\n\nOn November 8, 2018, the official \"Star Wars\" website announced that a live-action \"spy thriller\" series focusing on Cassian Andor from \"Rogue One\" would be released on Disney+ with Diego Luna reprising his role.\n\n\nTo promote its sets, Lego has created multiple short films, television specials, and animated series that parody the \"Star Wars\" saga. Lego versions of Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and Lando have a cameo appearance aboard the \"Millennium Falcon\" in \"The Lego Movie\", with the latter two voiced by their original actors.\n\nShort films\nTelevision specials\nAnimated series\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n"}

{"id": "8729838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8729838", "title": "Little Mosque on the Prairie", "text": "Little Mosque on the Prairie\n\nLittle Mosque on the Prairie is a Canadian television sitcom created by Zarqa Nawaz and produced by WestWind Pictures, originally broadcast between 2007 and 2012 on CBC. Filmed in Toronto, Ontario and Indian Head, Saskatchewan, the series was showcased at the Dawn Breakers International Film Festival. After the series finale aired in April 2012, Hulu announced it would begin offering the series under the name \"Little Mosque\" that summer. The series made its U.S. syndication debut on Pivot in August 2013.\n\nThe series focuses on the Muslim community in the fictional prairie town of Mercy, Saskatchewan (population 14,000). The primary institutions of the community are the local mosque, presided over by imam Amaar Rashid and located in the rented parish hall of the town's Anglican church, and Fatima's Café, a downtown diner run by Fatima Dinssa. The community patriarchs are Yasir Hamoudi, a construction contractor who originally fronted the money to establish the mosque under the pretense that he was renting office space for his business, and Baber Siddiqui, a college economics professor who served as the mosque's temporary imam until Amaar was hired.\n\nThe town of Mercy is governed by Mayor Ann Popowicz. Sarah Hamoudi, Yasir's wife, works as a public relations officer in Popowicz's office. However, after Yasir had to leave Mercy and go to Lebanon in season 4 episode 10, Sarah managed his contracting company.\n\nThe title is a play on the name of the classic American book and TV drama series, \"Little House on the Prairie\". The two series are not related aside from the modified version of the title logo which was used for early seasons.\n\n\nAlthough the show is set in Saskatchewan, the actual production is split between Saskatchewan and Ontario. Episodes 1 and 2 were filmed in Regina, but the rest of season one was filmed in the Toronto area. Indian Head, where a set has been built for the exterior of the mosque, doubles for the show's exteriors. Film Rescue International's building exterior stands in for the town hall and Certified Plumbing and Heating as the local used car dealership. The Novia Cafe, the front of which is used in the show as a stand-in for Fatima's, was located in Regina. It closed in the early summer of 2011.\n\nActors Zaib Shaikh and Aliza Vellani are Muslims. Sitara Hewitt (Rayyan) is also of partial Pakistani Muslim descent, but was raised Christian as both of her parents are Anglican Christians. Manoj Sood (Baber) is a Hindu Punjabi.\n\nZarqa Nawaz based much of the show on her personal experiences. Many of the characters are partially inspired by her family and friends. The episode \"The Barrier\" is based on a true happening at Nawaz's mosque when incoming conservative Muslims pressured the imam to put up a barrier separating men and women. The pilot episode also contained a satire of Maher Arar's 2002 detainment.\n\nIn the episode \"The Archdeacon Cometh\", the archdeacon mentions having to \"shut down a church in Dog River\", referencing Canadian sitcom \"Corner Gas\" on rival network CTV. Carlo Rota and Sheila McCarthy, in character as Yasir and Sarah, also later appeared in a crossover with Brent (Brent Butt) and Hank (Fred Ewanuick) from \"Corner Gas\" on the sketch comedy series \"Royal Canadian Air Farce\", debating the location of Mercy and Dog River (both fictional towns) in relation to each other after Yasir and Sarah bought the gas station and fired Brent.\n\nGuest actors who have appeared on the show include Colin Mochrie, Dan Redican, Samantha Bee, Dave Foley, Maria Vacratsis, Sam Kalilieh, Peter Wildman, Sugith Varughese, Hrant Alianak, Veena Sood, Kathryn Winslow, Jayne Eastwood, Patrick McKenna and Tom Jackson, as well as hockey player Darcy Tucker, curler Glenn Howard, and sportscaster Ron MacLean.\n\nThe show's executive producers are Mary Darling and Clark Donnelly, owners of WestWind Pictures, and Allan Magee. Producers are Colin Brunton and Michael Snook. Associate producer is Shane Corkery, with Jason Belleville, Dan Redican and Zarqa Nawaz as consulting producers.\n\nThe writing staff includes or has included Susan Alexander, Cole Bastedo, Jason Belleville, Andrew Carr, Andrew De Angelis, Claire Ross Dunn, Sadiya Durrani, Greg Eckler, Anthony Q. Farrell, Josh Gal, Sarah Glinski, Barbara Haynes, Karen Hill, Paul Mather, Jackie May, Zarqa Nawaz, Paul Pogue, Al Rae, Dan Redican, Sam Ruano, Vera Santamaria, Rebecca Schechter, Rob Sheridan, and Miles G. Smith. Carr, Mather, and Sheridan were previously writers for \"Corner Gas\".\n\nThe directors for the first four seasons include Michael Kennedy (33 episodes including the pilot and entire first season), Brian Roberts (14), Jim Allodi (6), Steve Wright (4), Jeff Beesley (4), Paul Fox (4), and Zarqa Nawaz (1).\n\nFaisal Kutty, a Toronto-based lawyer, academic and writer served as the first Islamic culture and practice content consultant for the show. He was responsible to provide advice and feedback on accuracy in terms of the portrayal of Islamic norms and practices. He also provided input to producers and writers.\n\nWhile the show does derive some of its humour from exploring the interactions of the Muslims with the non-Muslim townspeople of Mercy, and the contrast of conservative Islamic views (held primarily by the characters of Baber and Fatima) with more liberal interpretations of Islam (as represented by Amaar and Rayyan), at its core the show is essentially a traditional sitcom whose most unusual trait is the simple fact of being set among an underrepresented and misunderstood cultural community. Nawaz herself has stated that the show's primary agenda is to be funny, not to be a political platform. She has also stated that she views comedy as one of the most valuable and powerful ways to break down barriers and to encourage dialogue and understanding between cultures.\n\nThis is represented by the show's promotional tagline, \"Small town Canada with a little Muslim twist\": the religious angle, while always present, is largely tied to and sometimes even secondary to standard and universal sitcom themes such as family, friends and the humour in everyday life. For example, while the show sometimes tackles storylines with a political edge, such as a character claiming to be unable to attend a conference in the United States because he says he was wrongly placed on a no-fly list (when in fact he is simply afraid of flying) or the mosque being raided by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, even these situations are explored as much for their humour as their politics. The show much more commonly explores purely comedic issues such as whether a Muslim woman still has to cover her hair if the only man who can see her is gay, whether Muslims can curl, whether to haggle with the carpet salesman when buying a prayer rug, or whether a Muslim woman's head scarf is enough to mitigate a bad hair day. Television critics have also credited this very combination of an attention-grabbing premise with conventional and familiar sitcom themes as one of the primary reasons that the show successfully retained an audience after its debut.\n\nThe series also sidesteps issues of stereotyping by having characters in both the Muslim and non-Muslim communities who cross the entire spectrum of political opinion. Baber and Fatima, who represent conservative views within Islam, are balanced by conservative radio host Fred Tupper among the non-Muslims, while Amaar and Rayyan, who represent Islamic liberalism, are balanced by the liberal Anglican Rev. Magee. The more moderate Yasir and Sarah, who try to be good Muslims but aren't particularly strongly defined by their faith, are balanced among the non-Muslims by Mayor Popowicz, who doesn't care what anybody's religious beliefs are as long as they vote for her on election day.\n\nHewitt's character of Rayyan Hamoudi, in particular, has been singled out in the media as a strong and unique role model for young Muslim women—both for her ability to reconcile a commitment to her Muslim faith with a modern, feminist-inspired Western lifestyle and career, and as a fashion icon who dresses in clothes that are religiously appropriate yet stylish, professional and contemporary.\n\nEntertainment One has released all six seasons of \"Little Mosque on the Prairie\" on DVD in Region 1 (Canada only). Season 6 was released on 23 October 2012.\nThe series logo used for the cover art of the DVD releases does not use the mosque imagery of the televised version, thus rendering it similar to that used by \"Little House on the Prairie\" except for the use of the word \"Mosque\" instead of \"House\".\n\nUnusual for a Canadian television series, \"Little Mosque\" received extensive advance publicity in international media, with stories appearing in \"The New York Times\", the \"Washington Times\" and the \"Houston Chronicle\", as well as on CNN, NPR and the BBC.\n\nThe show premiered on January 9, 2007, at 8:30 p.m. The pilot then reaired on January 15 in the show's regular timeslot, and the series subsequently aired Mondays at 8:00 p.m. (all times half an hour later in Newfoundland).\n\nThe series premiere drew an audience of 2.1 million, an exceptionally strong rating for domestic programming in the Canadian television market, and on par with Canadian ratings for popular American series. It was, in fact, the largest audience the CBC had achieved in a decade for an entertainment program. By comparison, \"Corner Gas\", one of the highest-rated Canadian TV shows, attracts just under one and a half million viewers for a typical episode. The second episode, airing against the second night of the much-anticipated season premiere of \"American Idol\" in most markets, had 1.2 million viewers, a sharp drop but still a high rating for a Canadian sitcom, and very high for CBC Television, which has had trouble garnering large audiences for its scripted programming in recent years.\n\nAt the end of the show's season on March 7, 2007, the show attracted 1.1 million viewers, or an average of 1.2 million for the season. CBC Television renewed the show for a second season consisting of 20 episodes, which began airing on October 3, 2007, and continued to attract an average of one million viewers per episode.\n\nCBC renewed the show for a third season on March 7, 2008. Season three premiered on CBC Television October 1, 2008. In its third season ratings declined and as of December 2008 it was attracting a quarter of its original audience. In its fourth season ratings declined further and as of December 2009 it was drawing 420,000 viewers a week, or twenty percent of its original audience.\n\nOn February 11, 2011, it was announced that CBC had renewed the series for a sixth and final season. This season began airing on CBC on January 9, 2012 and concluded on April 2, 2012.\n\nCanadian writer and producer Ken Finkleman (best known for his CBC series \"The Newsroom\") criticized the show's sunny outlook. \"There’s deep confusion and racism about the place of Islam in the Western world and it’s the thing that’s broiling up under everything in the world, and the show presents this world where everything is happy.\"\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote: \"'Mosque' was conceived in the wake of the 2005 Danish Muhammad cartoon crisis by producer Mary Darling, her husband, Clark Donnelly, and writer Zarqa Nawaz when they met at the Banff Television Festival. The basic premise was: What would it look like if a Muslim born and raised in Canada became an imam?\"\n\nIn regards to the program's initially not being shown in the United States, the \"Los Angeles Times\" said: \"The genius of 'Mosque' is that the characters resonate with viewers all over the world. The show is broadcast in 83 countries, including the United Arab Emirates and Turkey; the format was sold to 20th Century Fox in 2008 for a U.S. remake but nothing came of it. Nawaz's explanation: 'We didn't have 9/11, and we have a public broadcaster. 9/11 affected the American psyche in a major way, and you have to be sensitive to that.'\"\n\nOn May 8, 2007, WestWind Pictures announced that the show would be airing in France, Switzerland, and francophone African countries beginning in July. The French television company Canal+ Group will distribute the show's first season in July to non-subscribers of Canal+, a channel to which viewers must subscribe in order to watch. French voice-actors will dub the show.\n\nOn September 26, 2007, WestWind Pictures announced that the show would soon air in Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, United Arab Emirates, Finland and Turkey. On October 2, 2007, Al Jazeera English confirmed that the United Arab Emirates and Finland had signed deals to begin airing the series in 2008.\n\nFrom June 12, 2008, SRC, CBC's French-language network in Canada, started to air the show, dubbed in French, under the title \"La Petite Mosquée dans la Prairie\".\n\nThe series began airing under the name \"Little Mosque\" on Hulu in June 2012.\n\nThe series made its United States television debut on Pivot in August 2013 under the name \"Little Mosque.\"\n\nThe show was nominated for Best Writing at the 2007 Canadian Comedy Awards. The episode \"The Convert\" was nominated for Best Writing in a Comedy or Variety Program or Series and Best Direction in a Comedy Program or Series at the 2007 Gemini Awards. The show was also nominated for Best Television Series – Comedy at the 2007 Directors Guild of Canada Awards.\n\nInternationally, \"Little Mosque\" won awards for Best International Television Series and Best Screenplay at the 2007 RomaFictionFest. Former Canadian federal Member of Parliament Rahim Jaffer, who is Muslim, and director Michael Kennedy introduced the program screening.\n\nThe show won the Canada Award for media representation of multiculturalism at the 2007 Gemini Awards, and the 2007 Search for Common Ground Award, an international humanitarian award whose past recipients have included Muhammad Ali, Desmond Tutu and Jimmy Carter.\n\nSince the producers of the show are Baha'is, it was selected and showcased in the Dawn Breakers International Film Festival in both 2008 and 2009 festivals making its first international film festival premieres in the US and Europe.\n\nIn June 2008 Fox announced plans to adapt \"Little Mosque on the Prairie\" into an American setting, in partnership with the show's production company, WestWind Pictures. The planned deal would not affect the Canadian version if it were to be picked up in the United States by another distributor or network. The U.S. version of the show has never been produced since the acquisition.\n\nIn 2012, PPI Releasing, LLC acquired the U.S. broadcast rights of the Canadian television series.\n\n"}

Martin, who was affectionately known as \"The Miller's daughter\", a song he made his own, started in show business in his early 1930s.\n\nThe eldest in a family of four, he was christened John Martin but was known as Mossy to his family and friends. His mother and father came from Wexford town. His father, Martin, was a foreman-fitter and turner on the Permanent way, that is the tracks section, of the old Dublin United Tramways. Before coming to Dublin, his father had earned quite a reputation in his native town, both as a singer and comedian. He won the Wexford Feis gold medal in 1904 in the tenor competition. Martin's paternal grandmother was reputed to have had a three-octave voice, and sang in Bride Street Church (Church of the Assumption), Wexford. Before his singing career began, he worked as a fitter/mechanic in CIE's Summerhill depot.\n\n\"One night in the late 1930's himself and the legendary Billy Morton went to a show in the Olympia. In the bar during the interval Billy and other friends talked him into singing a song. One song led to another and soon there were more people in the bar than in the audience. The manager came in and said if he could keep an audience away from the show he should be able to keep them in their seats the following week. That's how he joined Lorcan Bourke Productions. Martin caused a bit of stir the next Monday night when he cycled to the Olympia, walked through the stage door, hung up his bicycle clips, and went straight out on stage to sing. I didn't know anything then about using dressing-rooms and make-up he had laughed.\"\n\nHis CIE supervisor recognised a genuine talent and gave him a couple of months leave of absence, and pretty soon Martin was a star of variety at the Royal and the Capitol where the \"Miller's Daughter\" legend was born in 1942.\n\nIt was when he was playing in Belfast with Harry Bailey that he met Thelma Ramsey, who would become his wife. When he came back to the Royal in Dublin, Thelma was the accompanist. They toured with some of showbiz's big names, including famous comic Max Miller. They missed out on playing the London Palladium with Max as he was allowed to bring only one other act. A halfpenny was tossed and they lost. \"Imagine losing the Palladium with a halfpenny… wouldn't have minded had it been half-a-crown!\"\n\nA regular in the Clontarf Castle Cabaret from 1964, he continued to perform six nights a week even when his health started to fail him in the early 1980s. In 1979, he received the Variety Artists' Trust Society award for his contribution to Irish show-business. He made numerous Television appearances, some of which still survive on R.T.E. and Ulster Television etc. He was a member of Equity and appeared in small parts in most of the Films made in Ireland at that time.\n\n\nMartin Crosbie died on 10 February 1982 from cancer. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery Dublin. A special Tribute Show was held in The Olympia on Sunday 28 February by his friends in show business – Listed as they appeared on the bill.\n\n\n"}

Their long collaboration, with focus on the design of public aquariums, began in 1975 when Bobby Poole joined Cambridge Seven Associates, where Peter Chermayeff was a founding principal together with Paul Dietrich, Terry Rankine, Louis Bakanowsky, Alden Christie, Ivan Chermayeff, and Tom Geismar. The first project for the seven founding principals was the New England Aquarium, of which Peter Chermayeff was the principal in charge. It opened in 1969.\n\nThe first thirty six years of design work at Cambridge Seven Associates, in much of which Peter Chermayeff played a leading role, included the modernization of the Boston Transportation system, the MBTA, now known as the T, the United States Pavilion and Exhibition at Expo '67, the National Aquarium in Baltimore, the San Antonio Museum of Art, Charles Square, a hotel, retail, housing and office complex in Cambridge, Massachusetts, “Where’s Boston?”, a mixed media celebration and portrait of Boston for the U.S. Bicentennial, the Osaka Aquarium, the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, the Aquarium of Genoa.

Poole became the Aquarium’s Project Architect. He led the preparation of final design documents, the on-site overview of construction and installation, and became a principal in 1986. He further developed his interest in aquariums working with Peter Chermayeff on the Osaka Aquarium, the Tennessee Aquarium, the Aquarium of Genoa, the Lisbon Oceanarium, and the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward, Alaska.

It publishes plays, represents authors, and sells scripts from their Los Angeles, UK, and online bookstores.\n\nThe firm has offices in New York City; London; and Hollywood, California.\n\nThe company's London subsidiary, Samuel French Ltd., publishes stage plays for the UK market, mostly acting editions, serves as licensing agent for performance rights, and runs a theatrical bookshop on its premises at Fitzrovia in central London, England.\n\nSamuel French was born in Massachusetts shortly after the turn of the 19th century and began publishing \"French’s American Drama\" in the mid 1800s in New York. It soon became the most widely distributed catalogue of dramatic prose in the US. French soon acquired a London dramatic publishing company founded by Thomas Hailes Lacey, and continued to expand his business on both sides of the Atlantic - Samuel French managing the London business while his son, Thomas Henry, took control of the New York operations.\n\nIn the late 1800s, Samuel French began publishing contemporary American dramas, and helped the amateur theatre movement by making more plays available to “Little Theatres” – a rewarding concept that had never before been done in the industry. By the turn of the century, amateur interest in acting had increased enormously. As the quality and quantity of available plays improved, so the number of amateur groups increased. The seeds of the Little Theatre movement were sown. By the time of the World War I, such groups along with the High School societies were the firm’s best customers. Although father and son had long since died, the New York and London entities continued under the capable hands of their managing partners. \n\nFrom the mid 1940s to the early 1990s, the company witnessed much growth in its catalogue and business. During this time, the Stock companies, including the League of Regional Theatres were flourishing; so too were the Little Theatres, and the development of the Dinner Theatre, which was proving increasingly popular. Since the mid 1990s, the Samuel French catalogue has grown substantially with a focus on emerging playwrights carefully balanced by additional acquisitions of the most prominent American and British playwrights such as Neil Simon, Tom Stoppard, Edward Albee, August Wilson and David Mamet to name but a few.\n\n\nSamuel French publishes an online magazine entitled \"Breaking Character.\" On the site, staff members and guest authors contribute to writing various articles related to the world of theatre. Some topics include new publications, title spotlights, musical moments, staff picks, and playwright profiles. The magazine also allows for interaction with the public.\n\nSamuel French’s annual Off-Off-Broadway Short Play Festival (commonly referred to as OOB) takes place every summer in New York City. Thousands of playwrights from around the world submit their short plays for consideration, but only 30 are chosen to participate. The festival takes place over a week, with 4-8 plays being presented per night. Finalists are narrowed down and eventually six are chosen as the winners. Winners are presented with publication and licensing rights and have their show published in a collection of winners from that year. The festival has resulted in the publishing of nearly 200 plays since its inception in 1975 and has launched the careers of many playwrights including Sheila Callaghan, Theresa Rebeck and Saviana Stanescu. As of 2017 the festival is in its 42nd year.\n\nSamuel French Ltd is the UK sister company of Samuel French Inc.. The company publishes stage plays for the UK market, mostly acting editions, serves as licensing agent for performance rights. The theatrical bookshop at Fitzroy Street in central London, England closed in 2017, however it was announced that they would be opening a bookshop inside the Royal Court Theatre in March 2018.\n\nThe company was founded when Samuel French and Thomas Hailes Lacy formed a partnership, combining their existing interests in London and New York City.\n"}

It is thought that the existence and popularity of the award is one of the major drivers of the quality of games coming out of Germany. A Spiel des Jahres nomination can increase the typical sales of a game from 500–3000 copies to around 10,000; and the winner can usually expect to sell 300,000 to 500,000 copies.\n\nThe award is given by a jury of German-speaking board game critics (from Germany, Austria, Switzerland), who review games released in Germany in the preceding twelve months. The games considered for the award are family-style games. War games, role-playing games, collectible card games, and other complicated, highly competitive, or hobbyist games are outside the scope of the award. Since 1989, there has been a separate award for children's games.\n\nOn occasion, the jury has awarded a special prize for more complex games, such as Agricola in 2008 or World Without End in 2010. Prior to 2011, this award was an exceptional award, not necessarily awarded annually. In 2011, however, this practice was formalized when the jury created a new category for more complex games entitled \"Kennerspiel des Jahres\" (roughly \"Connoisseur-Enthusiast Game of the Year\"). Along with the nominations, the jury also gives a list of recommended games, and occasionally gives out special prizes for games which will not be considered for the main award.\n\nThe criteria on which a game is evaluated are,:\n\nThe nominations and the special prize for the 2018 award were announced on May 14, 2018.

Tai is owned by \"Have Trunk Will Travel, Inc.\", a privately funded organization that generates income through elephant rides, shows and events, as well as film and commercial appearances.\n\nTai's first film appearance was a minor role in \"The Jungle Book\" (1994), where she scares off some poachers. Tai followed this up playing the major role of Bo Tat in \"Operation Dumbo Drop\" in 1995. The American Humane Association rated the treatment of animals in the film as acceptable. The scene in which Tai is sedated she is actually just obeying her trainers instructions to lie down. The sounds of her snoring in the film is not actually coming from Tai, but was dubbed in during post-production. All scenes that show Tai in danger were carefully staged, and the boat in which she travels in the film was pre-tested to make sure it would support her 8,000 pound (3600 kg) weight. To ensure she remained healthy, all of Tai's food, drinking water, and even her bathing water, was shipped from the U.S. to Thailand, where filming was taking place.\n\nTai played the major role of Vera in the 1996 comedy \"Larger than Life\" alongside Bill Murray, and had a minor role in \"George of the Jungle\" in 1997, where she can be seen being ridden by Brendan Fraser and Leslie Mann, and again with Brendan Fraser in Tweety Bird's jungle in \"\" in 2002.\n\nTai's performance in \"Water for Elephants\" in 2011 was praised. It was the second time Tai, Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson had all worked on the same film, as all three had been filmed in \"Vanity Fair\" in 2004, though Pattinson's part was edited out of the final cut.\n\nOne of Tai's paintings as well as an autographed poster for \"Water for Elephants\" was auctioned off on eBay to raise awareness of elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus. The money Tai raised from the auction was given to the International Elephant Foundation (IEF) which distributed it to the appropriate labs and research facilities actively working to find a cure for EEHV.\n\nIn 2008 Tai, along with Kitty, another elephant owned by \"Have Trunk Will Travel\", appeared in Britney Spears music video \"Circus\". Animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) issued a press release condemning Spears for using \"cruelly trained lions and elephants\". \"Have Trunk Will Travel\" responded, saying, \"A representative [from the American Humane Association] was on the set of the Britney Spears 'Circus' video with our elephants, Tai and Kitty, to ensure their safety and welfare [...] Britney, the director, producers and the entire crew were respectful of the elephants' needs and comfort and a pleasure to work with.\"\n\nIn 2009 Tai appeared in the Banksy film \"Exit Through the Gift Shop\" as part of his 2006 \"Barely Legal\" art show for which she was painted pink and gold with non-toxic paint. PETA called the display animal cruelty.\n\nIn the film \"Water for Elephants\" the elephant Rosie, who Tai portrays, is severely abused. A spokesperson from the AHA assured people that all scenes of abuse in the film were the work of special effects and CGI, and that the moaning and crying sounds that Tai is seen making on film were audio tracks, and were not actually made by Tai.\n\nControversy erupted, however, regarding concerns Tai was mistreated prior to filming. A video released by the Animal Defenders International (ADI) in 2011 shows footage of Tai allegedly being shocked with handheld stun guns and beaten around the body and legs with bull hooks, while in the care of \"Have Trunk Will Travel\" in 2005. The ADI contacted AHA, urging them to re-evaluate how they assess the use of animals in films and the statements being made which effectively endorse the use of performing animals.\n\n\"Have Trunk Will Travel\" responded to the video stating, \"The video shows heavily edited and very short snippets, obviously taken surreptitiously six years ago, purporting mistreatment of our elephants. If there was truly any abuse going on why wait six minutes, much less six years?\" and added \"None of the footage being shown was taken during Tai's training for Water for Elephants.\"\n\nWhen the 2011 film \"Zookeeper\" was released, PETA protested against alleged animal cruelty in the film's production. Protesters held various posters including stills of the footage the ADI released showing Tai being struck with bull hooks in 2005. Tai was reported to be featured in the film however the film's director, Frank Coraci, denied using any elephants from \"Have Trunk Will Travel\" in filming. The elephant used in the film is Tai's Have Trunk Will Travel herd mate, Rosie.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23700814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23700814", "title": "Transnational cinema", "text": "Transnational cinema\n\nTransnational cinema is a developing concept within film studies that encompasses a range of theories relating to the effects of globalization upon the cultural and economic aspects of film. It incorporates the debates and influences of postnationalism, postcolonialism, consumerism and Third cinema, amongst many other topics.\n\nTransnational cinema debates consider the development and subsequent effect of films, cinemas and directors which span national boundaries.\n\nA key argument of transnational cinema is the necessity for a redefinition, or even refutation, of the concept of a national cinema. National identity has been posited as an 'imaginary community' that in reality is formed of many separate and fragmented communities defined more by social class, economic class, sexuality, gender, generation, religion, ethnicity, political belief and fashion, than nationality.\n\nThe increasingly transnational practices in film funding, production and distribution combined with the 'imagined community' thus provide the basis for an argued shift towards a greater use of transnational, rather than national, perspectives within film studies. Global communication through the internet has also resulted in changes within culture and has further resulted in film transcending perceived national boundaries.\n\nThe concept of transnational cinema is important because it will be able to change how films from different cultures are approached. Mostly the approach is Eurocentric and the field of studying cinema is full of biases. It is mainly about how western culture views eastern culture.\n\nDefining transnational cinema must be done carefully. It should challenge and criticize Orientalism that is rooted in film studies. It should be also differentiated from world cinema, which marks cinemas from countries that are not Anglo-phone as \"others\" and bind them in one category without realizing that they each have unique culture and identity.\n\n\"In the study of films, a critical transnationalism does not ghettoize transnational film-making in interstitial and marginal spaces but rather interrogates how these film-making activities negotiate with the national on all levels – from cultural policy to financial sources, from the multiculturalism of difference to how it reconfigures the nation’s image of itself.\"\n\nThe broad scope of topics relating to Transnational cinema have raised some criticisms over its exact definition, as Mette Hjort notes:\n\n(...) to date the discourse of cinematic transnationalism has been characterized less by competing theories and approaches than by a tendency to use the term ‘transnational’ as a largely self-evident qualifier requiring only minimal conceptual clarification.\n\nSubsequently, Hjort, John Hess and Patricia R. Zimmermann, amongst others, have attempted to clearly define the utilisation and implementation of Transnational cinema theories. To assist the ongoing discussions, \"Transnational Cinemas\", the first Academic Journal dedicated to the ongoing debates, has been announced by Intellect for publication in 2010.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the first NFPF set to feature audio commentary. \"Treasures III: Social Issues in American Film, 1900-1934\" looks at socially inflected films during the formative years cinema, when virtually no issue was too controversial for the big screen. \"Treasures IV: American Avant-Garde Film, 1947-1986\" is the first multi-artist survey of the avant-garde film movement in the years following World War II. \"Treasures 5: The West, 1898-1938\" explores how the West was imagined and documented in early cinema. \"Lost and Found: American Treasures From the New Zealand Film Archive\" presents a sampling of repatriated American films previously existing only in foreign archives.\n\nTo date, six sets of DVDs present 227 films on 17 discs for a total run time of 3,059 minutes (51 hours).
