The strike (the first in the union's 121-year history) commenced on November 10, 2007, at 10:00 A.M. in New York City. It was the second strike on Broadway in five years (the other was the 2003 Broadway Musicians Strike).\n\nOn November 28, 2007, at 10:30 pm, the two sides announced a settlement to end the strike, with shows beginning the evening of November 29. This was the longest strike to hit Broadway since a 25-day musicians' strike in 1975.\n\nIATSE Local One engages in collective bargaining with the League of American Theatres and Producers (the League), an association of Broadway theater owners and producers.\n\nIATSE Local One was formed in 1886, and represents about 3,000 stagehands and other theater workers in the New York City area. Roughly 350 to 500 of its members work for Broadway theaters, building, installing and operating scenery and sound and lighting equipment.\n\nThe League includes nearly every one of the 39 theaters on Broadway. The Jujamcyn Amusement Corporation owns five theaters, The Shubert Organization 17 theaters, and the Nederlander Organization nine theaters. The remaining members of the League (Disney Theatrical, Live Nation and six nonprofits) each own a single theater. Generally, Jujamcyn and the Shubert Organization are the only owners represented by the League in negotiations. The Nederlander Organization has a separate contract, but a clause in the contract guarantees that its terms and conditions reflect the contract reached with the League. The remaining League members engage in individual contract negotiations with IATSE Local One.\n\nThe collective bargaining agreement between Local One and the League expired in the summer of 2007. Members of Local One agreed to work without a contract and promised other unions in the entertainment industry that they would not strike until an agreement was reached. In late summer, Local One and the League, representing the Shubert and Jujamcyn theaters with the Nederlander Organization observing, entered into negotiations.\n\nContract negotiations generally focused on work rules. Broadway shows offer a standard eight performances per week (\"performance calls\"), each of which lasts three to four hours. Additionally, there are \"load-ins\" (periods during which a show moves into a theater), rehearsals, \"maintenance calls\" (during which scenery, lighting and sound equipment are serviced, repaired and maintained), and opportunities for overtime. The League has accused the union of using its contract to secure featherbedding, a practice made illegal by the federal Taft-Hartley Act. Among the work rule changes sought by the League were:\n\nMany labor relations experts said that the negotiations were not about work rules or economics, but the relative power of the two sides. Producers, who pay the theater owners, are also part of the League, and for the first time they took a vocal and active role in pushing for contract changes in order to break the union's control over theater management. Subsequently the League established a $20 million \"defense fund\" to help theaters weather a strike. In response, the union established a $4 million fund to help its members during a possible job action.\n\nContract negotiations stalled between the two parties and the league threatened Local One with a lockout if it would not comply with their demands. On October 21, Local One held a special meeting and its membership voted to authorize the executive board of the union to take any action deemed necessary, including but not limited to a strike, in order to reach an agreement between the two parties.\n\nIn late October 2007, talks between Local One and the League again ended in a stalemate. On October 16, the League imposed a portion of its final offer (primarily, the proposals regarding new work rules) on the union. For two weeks Local One worked under these rules before talks with the League resumed. The following day, the Nederlander Organization announced it would not join the Jujamcyn or Schubert owners in imposing the final offer on the union.\n\nOn November 8, talks with the League resumed, this time including Thomas C. Short, international president of IATSE, for part of the negotiation session. After seeing progress being made, President Short left the talks early to assist members affected by the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike. After his departure, the negotiations once more ground to a halt. On the evening of November 9, Local One President James Claffey, Jr. was directed by International President Short to begin a strike on Saturday, November 10, 2007 at 10:00 AM Eastern time.\n\nNegotiations resumed between both sides on November 17, 2007 but broke off the following day. All performances of the affected Broadway shows were canceled through November 25. Negotiations between the League and Local One resumed on November 25.\n\nNegotiations continued November 26 and November 27. The first bargaining session began November 25, and lasted 20 hours. It recessed at dawn on November 26, and resumed later that evening. A 13-hour bargaining session lasted through the night into the early morning hours of November 27. The two sides agreed on work rules regarding \"load-in\"—the period when productions are moved into theaters. Talks concerning work rules governing rehearsals and other kinds of work progressed only slowly and incrementally. Economic issues, such as wages, had yet to be seriously discussed. Although producers canceled all shows through Wednesday, November 28, observers noted that the talks had only taken a break and had not appeared to actually break off.\n\nBoth sides applauded the agreement. The union and League agreed to flexibility in the ability to dismiss stagehands during load-in, so long as there was a daily minimum of 17 stagehands on duty at all times. The parties also agreed to extend the continuity call to two hours before or after a performance. However, employees who work the post-performance continuity call earn double pay for the first hour of the two-hour continuity call. Union members also won raises significantly higher than the 3.5 percent increase the League had publicly offered.\n\nThe strike was a costly one. At least one estimate placed losses by theater owners and producers at $34.8 million through Sunday, November 25. The New York City comptroller's office said the city had lost another $40 million in revenue through November 28.\n\nBelow is a list of unions and IATSE Locals honoring Local One's strike:\n\n\nThe first show to be affected by the strike was \"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical\" at the St. James theater. Stagehands reported to work at their normal time, and after one hour of working left the building and formed picket lines outside. However, because the controlling contract fell outside the union dispute, pickets in front of the theater ended.\n\nThe strike halted business for all other affected shows. However, unaffected Broadway shows, various Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway productions, and other live entertainment such as the \"Radio City Christmas Spectacular\" and \"Wintuk\", all experienced a boom in sales and attendance.\n\nThe impact of the strike was severe. The New York City Comptroller estimated that the city had lost $2 million a day in tax revenue because of the strike. Many businesses in and around Times Square also suffered significant financial losses. The charity group Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS saw a dramatic drop in donations due to the strike, because it normally relies on donations from theater patrons after performances. BC/EFA launched an internet donation campaign called \"Team Raiser\" to offset losses.\n\nBelow is a list of shows affected and unaffected by the strike. All Off- and Off-Off-Broadway shows were unaffected.\n\n\n\"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\" was originally part of the strike, and shut down on November 10 like the other affected shows. The producers of this show were not members of the League, and because of the show's special schedule they had negotiated a separate contract with Local One that was not in dispute. On November 19, the union authorized its members return to work on the show. However, the owners of the St. James Theater, Jujamcyn Theatres, locked out both producers and stagehands, keeping the show closed. The producers then sought an injunction in the Manhattan Supreme Court to force the owners to reopen the theater, and on November 21 the judge granted the injunction, allowing the show to re-open on Friday, November 23 at 11:00 AM. Jujamcyn Theatres had planned to appeal the ruling, but dropped the case, allowing \"Grinch\" to play its entire run.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the fourth and final installment in the \"3 Ninjas\" franchise.\n\nThe film starred only three of the original actors and was directed by Sean McNamara. None of the child actors from the previous films returned for this installment. Victor Wong is the only cast member to appear in all four films. It is also his final film before his death in 2001. It grossed US$ $375,805 domestically, making it the least profitable of the franchise by far. It was filmed in Denver, Colorado at Elitch Gardens.\n\nDuring their summer vacation with their grandfather Mori, Rocky, Colt and Tum-Tum take a test on an obstacle course in pitch blackness. They passed the test. Later that night, he overhears Rocky and Colt planning on not returning the next year, due to getting older and he becomes depressed at this.\n\nReturning home, Tum-Tum is also becomes very depressed that his favorite TV Series Dave Dragon is going off the air soon and not even food can cheer him up, which confuses his mother Jessica. They meet a new neighbor, Amanda who accidentally sends her remote controlled helicopter into their house; she apologizes, and Jessica invites her to attend Tum-Tum's birthday party at Mega Mountain; an amusement park modeled after Six Flags. Once they get to the park, Rocky goes off on his own to be with his girlfriend Jennifer while Tum-Tum convinces Colt to go with him to a special live Dave Dragon show as his last performance. While the kids are enjoying themselves, a criminal named Mary Ann \"Medusa\" Rogers and her mens sneak in and commandeer the park, disabling many rides and shutting the place down to hold the patrons hostage in exchange for $10 Million from the park's owner Harry Jacobson. The boys and Amanda discover this and save Dave from being captured, as he seems to be the only viable threat to Medusa's plans. Amanda uses her laptop to try and override the controls, but Medusa's henchmen wrest control from her. Fearing they will interfere with her, she sends her idiot nephews out to capture them, but they are tricked by the boys and their access to an arsenal of small weapons and devices that Amanda possesses. Meanwhile, Dave sneaks into the command center, but is quickly discovered and captured.\n\nFinding video of Rocky and his girlfriend, she sends her second-in-command Lothar Zogg out to make sure they don't interfere. Medusa's nephews captures Jennifer and ties her to the bottom of a roller coaster loop. Medusa threatens to release the breaks and crush her if they don't cooperate, but Rocky goes to rescue her, But he gets attacked by Lothar. After a fight leading Rocky and Lothar to the top of the coaster, Rocky sends him off and he bounces out of the park and into the hands of the FBI. He then manages to free Jennifer before the roller coaster can crush them. Jacobson arrives via helicopter with the money to pay the ransom, but Amanda manages to destroy one of the bags with her helicopter. She is quickly captured by Medusa and they escape underground with the remainder of the money. Darkening the halls, the boys must overcome their weakness in the dark in order to rescue Amanda, who is tied to a bomb. They manage to free her, but they are unable to disarm the bomb, they attach it to an oxygen tank and with Dave's help, they bat off the top of the tank, sending it like a torpedo down Medusa's escape route. Alerted to the explosion, the FBI manages to capture Medusa, who resigns herself to defeat.\n\nNow hailed as heroes, the boys give the credit to Dave Dragon, hailing him as the real hero, to the press, the boys return home and assure Mori they will not be leaving their training. They also extend the offer to Amanda to come train with them the following year, and she gladly accepts.\n\n\nFilming began in 1996. Hulk Hogan, wrestling in World Championship Wrestling at the time, wore a wig for the film which resulted in him having a different hairstyle than his traditional bald look. As a result, he is seen in Halloween Havoc 1996 with a similar hairstyle as he had in the film. Elitch Gardens, the park at which it was filmed, underwent a complete remodel, with all the signs for the park and rides being changed and renamed for the film. However, there are a few times when the real ones are seen in the background.\n\nThe film had universally negative reviews and is generally considered to be the worst of the four in the series. It has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on six reviews.\n"}

The episode aired on November 22, 2009 on Fox in the United States. In this episode Cleveland Brown celebrates his first Thanksgiving with his new family, including his own parents and Donna's Auntie Momma.\n\nCleveland celebrates Thanksgiving with his new family and his parents, Cookie and LeVar \"Freight Train\" Brown. Things become hostile until Donna's Auntie Momma arrives. Cleveland soon discovers that Auntie Momma is a trans woman after he sees her urinating while standing. He tries to tell Donna but refrains because she would be crushed to learn the truth. LeVar becomes smitten with Auntie Momma. Cleveland tries to tell his father about her but refrains, believing it is best that his father find out the hard way. Cleveland also learns from Rallo that he had known all along from sitting on Auntie Momma's lap. When LeVar and Auntie Momma come back down from having sex, they start teasing each other at dinner by subtly acting out their antics with the food. Cleveland becomes so disgusted and surprised that his father did not notice that he vomits all over the table. \nMeanwhile, Roberta decides to spend a romantic Thanksgiving together with Federline, but Donna refuses to let her. Only Auntie Momma's influence convinces Donna to let her leave. As the couple kiss by a river, Federline's car is stolen by two homeless men. They track the car to a mission where the poor (including Lester's family) are eating, being served by the Bear family. The homeless man who stole the car gives back the keys. Roberta notices the unity around her and realizes that family is more important. She returns home and apologizes to her mother.\nLater Cleveland confronts Auntie Momma and learns that she is actually Uncle Kevin, who was acting as a strong, female influence for Donna in place of her parents. He disguised his physical sex from LeVar. Since she sees that Cleveland will take good care of Donna, \"Auntie Momma\" decides that it is time to leave. Soon after, Cleveland tells his father the truth, causing him to vomit over the front porch before convincing him to reconcile with Cookie.\n\nThe episode also introduces Cleveland's father, Freight Train, who is portrayed by Craig Robinson, Cleveland's mother, Cookie, who is portrayed by Frances Callier, and Auntie Momma, who is portrayed by Kym Whitley.\n\nThe episode was viewed by 6.32 million people being the third most viewed episode in its time slot. \"The A.V. Club\" graded the episode a C+, stating \"It's not a big deal if these shows don't want to do complicated character development (Lord knows \"Family Guy\" didn't need it), but \"Cleveland Show\" has headed in this direction so often that I was a bit disappointed the episode didn't tie all of this together better\".\n\"A Brown Thanksgiving\" came under fire from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) after Bil Browning of the LGBT blog The Bilerico Project expressed shock at the organization's lack of response to the portrayal of a transgender character. GLAAD released a statement that it had already been in contact with Fox and the show's producers as \"part of an ongoing discussion that GLAAD is having with Fox regarding consistent homophobic and transphobic jokes in some of its animated programming. The problematic transgender episode Bilerico points to is one of several instances that the Entertainment Team will be discussing with them, as well as advocating for more fair LGBT inclusion.\" Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane said \"It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side.\" However, in May 2010 MacFarlane again drew GLAAD's ire when, in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Quagmire's Dad\", another character (Brian) also reacts to learning he had sex with a trans woman by vomiting for close to 30 seconds.\n\n\n"}

It consisted of a crane-like arm with two attached joysticks which could be manipulated to pick up small objects. It was essentially similar to industrial robots of the 1980s, though it was strictly user-controlled, with no automation built in.\n\nThe Armatron existed in both the original fixed version and a mobile version with a wired remote. It included an \"energy level\" indicator (actually a countdown timer) and a series of objects such as boxes and spheres designed to be manipulated by the arm. Models with alternate decals or coloring were marketed under slightly different names, including the Super Armatron and the Armatron II.\n\nThe original Radio Shack Armatron also came with a module pack of items the Armatron was able to lift and move. The Module pack consisted of a Flat Module, with 2 cones and 2 globes as well as a \"closed module\" which also had impressions of the cones and globes on it as a second platform for the objects to be moved to and from.\n\nMovement of the arm was almost purely mechanical; the only electronic component was the motor.

Opened in 1977, later becoming a nonprofit organization, it became a tourist attraction. The circus has been known for its community outreach programs, including Clown Care, as well as its humane treatment of animals. Big Apple Circus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2016 and exited bankruptcy in February 2017 after its assets were bought by Compass Partners. The Circus was renewed in October 2017 for its 40th anniversary season. \n\nGregory Fedin and his then wife Nina Krasavina, both born and trained in Russia, started a circus school to train future \"first\" generation circus performers. They started the small school in a lower Manhattan loft.\n\nThe circus couple worked with Paul Binder and Michael Christensen to develop the Big Apple Circus following the European style \"one ring\" circus. In 1977, they located and secured an open ground area, in Battery Park, where the Big Apple Circus debuted. Headlining the early shows was a single trapeze, a dog act, tight rope walking, jugglers and clowns, double trapeze artists, and a host of other performers.\n\nDuring 1978, the circus moved from Manhattan. By 1979, two circus arts schools had been opened with money raised from the circus shows.\n\nThe Big Apple Circus began the 1980s with a special holiday celebration in honor of the circus and its staff.

In 1982, the circus won a silver medal at a circus performing competition held in Paris.\n\nThe circus began to arrange tours across New England in 1983. They also received an Obie award that year.\n\nBy 1984, the New York School for Circus Arts/Big Apple Circus relocated to East Harlem. The New York School for Circus Arts, in conjunction with New York City Public Schools and ArtsConnection, established the Young Talent Circus Training Program. The circus program mission was to teach talented children of diverse economic communities circus arts. One of the goals was to nurture and develop talent into potential circus performers. A core group of young circus \"talent\" participated in a circus competition resulting in a \"Gold Medal\" award.

The Boston engagement was particularly pleasant for the circus' performers, as it was one of the longest stays in that city that they had ever experienced. TJ Maxx began to sponsor Big Apple Circus appearances in Chicago and in Atlanta by bringing the \"Circus of the Senses\" to those cities.\n\nIn 1999, co-founder Michael Christensen was inducted into Miami's Ambassador David A. Walters pediatric Hall of Fame, for his \"contributions to pediatrics\" by way of the circus and its different programs.\n\nOnce again in 1999, \"Circus of the Senses\" attracted a large number of special children, with 9,000 kids participating.

{"id": "21756762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21756762", "title": "Byzantine lyra", "text": "Byzantine lyra\n\nThe Byzantine lyra or lira () was a medieval bowed string musical instrument in the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire. In its popular form the lyra was a pear-shaped instrument with three to five strings, held upright and played by stopping the strings from the side with fingernails. Remains of two actual examples of Byzantine lyras from the Middle ages have been found in excavations at Novgorod; one dated to 1190 AD. The first known depiction of the instrument is on a Byzantine ivory casket (900–1100 AD), preserved in the Bargello in Florence (\"Museo Nazionale, Florence, Coll. Carrand, No.26\"). Versions of the Byzantine lyra are still played throughout the former lands of the Byzantine Empire: Greece (Politiki lyra, lit. \"lyra of the City\" i.e. Constantinople), Crete (Cretan lyra), Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Croatia (Dalmatian Lijerica), Italy (Calabrian lira) and Turkey.\n\nThe first recorded reference to the bowed lyra was in the 9th century by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical discussion of instruments he cited the lyra (lūrā) as the typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the \"urghun\" (organ), \"shilyani\" (probably a type of harp or lyre) and the \"salandj\" (probably a bagpipe). The lyra spread widely via the Byzantine trade routes that linked the three continents; in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms \"fiddle\" and \"lira\" interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments. In the meantime, the rabāb, the bowed string instrument of the Arabic world, was introduced to Western Europe possibly through the Iberian Peninsula and both instruments spread widely throughout Europe giving birth to various European bowed instruments such as the medieval rebec, the Scandinavian and Icelandic talharpa. A notable example is the Italian \"lira da braccio\", a 15th-century bowed string instrument which is considered by many as the predecessor of the contemporary violin.\n\nFrom the organological point of view, the Byzantine lyra is in fact an instrument belonging to the family of bowed lutes; however, the designation \"lyra\" (\"Greek: λύρα ~ lūrā, English: lyre\") constitute of a terminological survival relating to the performing method of an ancient Greek instrument. The use of the term \"lyra\" for a bowed instrument was first recorded in the 9th century, probably as an application of the term lyre of the stringed musical instrument of classical antiquity to the new bowed string instrument.\nThe Byzantine lyra is sometimes informally called a \"medieval fiddle\", or a \"pear-shaped rebec\", or a \"kemanche\", terms that may be used today to refer to a general category of similar stringed instruments played with a horsehair bow.\n\nThe Byzantine lyra had rear tuning pegs set in a flat peg similarly to the medieval fiddle and unlike the rabāb and rebec. However, the strings were touched by the nails laterally and not pressed from above with the flesh of the finger such as in the violin.\nThe lyra depicted on the Byzantine ivory casket of Museo Nazionale, Florence (900 – 1100 AD) has two strings and pear-shaped body with long and narrow neck. The soundboard is depicted without soundholes and as a distinct and attached piece, however this might be due to stylistic abstraction. The lyras of Novgorod (1190 AD) are closer morphologically to the present bowed lyras (\"see gallery\"): they were pear-shaped and 40 cm long; they had semi-circular soundholes and provision for three strings. The middle string served as a drone while fingering the others by finger or fingernail alone, downwards or sidewards against the string, for there was no fingerboard to press them against: a method which gives the notes as clearly as the violin and remains normal in lyras both in Asia as well as on present bowed instruments in post-Byzantine regions such as the Cretan lyra.\n\nThe lyra of the Byzantine empire survives in many post-Byzantine regions until the present day even closely to its archetype form. Examples are the \"Politiki lyra\" (i.e. lyra of the Polis, or City, referring to Constantinople) () also known as the Classical Kemenche (Turkish: Klasik kemençe or Armudî kemençe) from Constantinople, used in today's Turkey and Greece, the Cretan lyra () and the one used in the Greek islands of the Dodecanese, the gadulka () in Bulgaria, the gusle in Serbia and Montenegro, the Calabrian lira () in Italy, and the Pontic lyra (Greek: ποντιακή λύρα; Turkish: Karadeniz kemençe) in the Pontic Greek communities, that existed (or still exist) around the shores of the Black Sea. The gudok, a historical Russian instrument that survived until the 19th century, is also a variant of the Byzantine lyra.\n\nSimilarly to the lyras found at Novgorod, the Cretan lyra, the Gadulka, the Calabrian Lira and the Greek lyras of Karpathos, Macedonia, Thrace and Mount Olympus are manufactured from a single wood block (monoblock), sculpted into a pear-shaped body. The slightly rounded body of the lyra is prolonged by a neck ending on the top in a block which is also pear-shaped or spherical. In that, are set the pegs facing and extending forward. The soundboard is also carved with a shallower arch and has two small semi-circular, D-shaped soundholes. The Cretan lyra is probably the most widely used surviving form of the Byzantine lyra, except that in Crete instrument-making has been influenced by that of the violin. Currently, numerous models tend to integrate the shape of the scroll, the finger board and other morphology of some secondary characteristics of the violin.\n\nThe modern variants of the lyra are tuned in various ways: LA–RE–SO (or a–d–g, i. e. by fifths) on the Cretan lyra; LA–RE–SO (or a–d–g, where SO [=g] is a perfect fourth higher than RE [=d] rather than a fifth lower) in Thrace and on Karpathos and the Dodecanese; LA–LA–MI (a–a–e, with the second LA [=a] an octave lower), in Drama; MI–SO–MI (e–g–e, i. e. a minor third and a major sixth) on the gadulka; LA–RE–LA (a–d–a, a fifth and a fourth) on the Classical Kemenche.\n\n"}

When the theatre was founded in 1887, it was originally meant as a permanent circus building. Currently, it is mainly used for musicals, cabaret performances and pop concerts.\n\nGerman circus director , looking for a location for circus performances in the winter, opened Circus Carré on 3 December 1887. In the beginning, it was just a wooden building with a stone façade. In the first years, it was only in use in the winter, but from 1893 on, Dutch theatre producer Frits van Haarlem brought vaudeville shows in the summer months. The shows became very successful, thus changing the circus building to a theatre for all forms of popular entertainment. In 1920, it changed its name to \"Theater Carré\".\n\nIn the early 20th century the building was mainly used for vaudeville and revue shows, occasionally Italian operas and operettas. Dutch stars like Lou Bandy and Louis Davids and international celebrities like Josephine Baker and the clown Grock performed here.\nAfter the Second World War, revues and winter circuses remained popular. In 1956, Carré introduced musical theatre to the Netherlands with \"Porgy and Bess\". The one-man show followed in 1963, when Toon Hermans gave his first solo cabaret show. At the end of the 1960s, the theatre was in danger of being demolished. After protests from artists, the municipality of Amsterdam finally refused permission for demolition. In 1977 the municipality bought the building. In 1987, at the centenary, the Royal Predicate was granted and the name was changed to \"Koninklijk Theater Carré\". In 2004, the theatre was completely renovated. The historic façade and interior design have been retained.\n"}

{"id": "6154701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6154701", "title": "Chindon'ya", "text": "Chindon'ya\n\nChindon'ya (チンドン屋), also called Japanese marching band, and in the old times also called tōzaiya (東西屋) or hiromeya (広目屋 or 披露目屋) are a type of elaborately costumed street musicians in Japan that advertise for shops and other establishments. The performers advertised the opening of new stores and other venues, or promoted special events such as price discounts. Nowadays, chindon'yas are rare in Japan. The word consists of Japanese sound symbolism \"chin\" and \"don\" to describe the instruments, and the \"-ya\" suffix which roughly equates to the English \"-er\" suffix in this context.\n\nStreet performers existed in Japan for a long time. However, the connection with advertising forming a \"chindon'ya\" first appeared in Osaka during the 19th century (Late Edo period and early Meiji period) at the beginning of industrialization. The first known \"chindon'ya\" is generally considered to be a candy seller in Osaka named Amekatsu, who around 1845 used singing and a noise making toy to attract attention to his own portable candy stall, as many other salespeople, especially candy sellers. Due to his strong voice he was well known in Osaka, and hence tried to sell not candy but rather advertise for other stores and a theater, wearing a large hat and straw sandals, and small bells at his belt, and used a wooden \"hyogoshi\" noisemaker. He was succeeded by a former bath attendant \"Isamikame\", who also used to shout \"tozai\" (Literally \"East-West\", equivalent to \"Listen up\" or \"welcome\" (come one come all)). Subsequently, such advertising street performers were called \"tozaiya\" in Osaka up to World War II. He soon received competition from another advertiser called \"Matemoto\", and they split their business, with one covering the Uemachi region and the other covering the Shinmachi region of Osaka. After Maemoto died in 1891, his brother, also called \"Maemoto\" took over the business, and he was soon joined by his son and daughter, probably the first female \"chindon'ya\". Maemoto is also famous as being the first person in Osaka to die from electric shock in 1893. Other well-known performers from this time are \"Tanbataya Kurimaru\", a former Sweet Chestnut seller, and \"Satsumaya Imosuke\", a former bean seller. These two also occasionally added a second performer to their band.\n\nAt the early Meiji period, such advertising was still unknown in Tokyo, and advertising was mainly done on curtains (\"noren\"), billboards (\"kanban\"), and flyers (\"hikifuda\"). Stalls also advertised for themselves by making noise and wearing colorful clothes, an at the time widely known example being the extremely colorful dressed pharmacist \"Iwashiya\". During this time, newspapers and posters also started to appear in Japan and were used for advertising. The military also started to popularize western style marching bands, and at the same time public bands started to appear. In 1885 an advertising agency in Tokyo \"hiromeya\"(wide eyes) hired musicians for advertising. \"Hiromeya\" was founded by a former \"tozaiya\" from Osaka \"Akita Ryukichi\". He soon found out that a one-person band was not as popular in Tokyo as in Osaka, and hired larger bands of more than 10 performers for advertising purposes, following the popularity of military and public bands. His band also provided entertainment at festivals and parties, and also created background music for silent films. He was also hired by the Kirin beer company, whose advertising campaign spread out to Osaka. In Osaka, this form of group bands was yet unknown, as only individual performers were hired for advertising. The police also had to stop some of the larger performances in Osaka, as they hindered traffic, partially also caused by the 2 meter tall beer bottle the group was equipped with. The Hiromeya business grew, and they were even asked to perform at the burial of Emperor Meiji in 1912. The business still exists nowadays, although they now do mainly decorations.\n\n\"Tanbataya Kurimaru\" and \"Satsumaya Imosuke\" in Osaka were inspired by the bands of \"hiromeya\" during the Kirin advertising campaign. They enlarged their groups and equipped them with drums and even fancier clothes, often matching the products of the advertised shop. However, they neglected rhythm and quality of the music over volume, and occasionally got arrested by the police. Some bigger engagements lasted for up to six months and reached out to Kyūshū and Shikoku.\n\nThe technological advances opened up many other ways of advertising that competed with the \"chindon'ya\". Since 1910 they had to compete with newspapers. Around 1920 balloons and airplanes carried large banners through the air, and around that time neon signs appeared in Tokyo. With the appearance of sound film in Japan in 1929 about 3000 street advertisers in Japan lost their jobs. A strike in 1930 had no effect and did not improve the situation. In response to the economic environment, the groups reduced their size to 4 to 5 people, and became known as \"chindon'ya\". For many this was the last step before unemployment and poverty, and hence the \"chindon'ya\" were considered to be of very low social status. The great depression in 1930 reduced the \"chindon'ya\" in Japan even more, and during World War II street performances were forbidden altogether.\n\nThe chindonya had a revival again between 1946 and 1956, and between 1950 and 1960 there were up to 2,500 \"chindon'ya\" active in Japan. They often performed on black markets. Many stores also moved from a street stall to fixed locations, generating business for \"chindon'ya\", as did the rise of the pachinko business. One well known group in Osaka was \"Aozora Gakudan\", founded by former actor \"Saeki Yosan\". This group played with up to 18 members, and many other \"chindon'ya\" joined this group. The introduction of TV and radio advertising had only a small effect on the \"chindon'ya\", as these new mediums were too expensive for the small shops that used the \"chindon'ya\" services, and not targeted enough for the customers living nearby the stores.\n\nSince the 1960s the number of \"chindon'ya\" has declined again, accelerated by the 1973 oil crisis with the subsequent recession. Around 1970, street performances were also banned in many large cities, as they hindered the traffic. In 1985 there remained around 150 \"chindon'ya\", with an average age of about 60 years. Public performances were also banned for several months during the illness and the death of emperor Hirohito in 1989.\n\nNowadays they are a rare sight in Japanese cities, and only 30-35 professional \"chindon'ya\" (\"puro no chindon'ya\") still exist, mostly in and around Tokyo, with another 30 amateur and hobby \"chindon'ya\" (\"shirōto chindon'ya\") performing at festivals. In recent years, however, there seems to be a very small increase again, as they can draw on their historic roots to evoke nostalgia. The social status of the performers has also improved. Thus, while far away from their golden days, \"chindon'ya\" hold a small niche in the advertising business in Japan. In Osaka, for example, \"Chindon Tsūshinsha\" (ちんどん通信社) performs for clothing stores, politicians, beauty salons, and restaurants, in addition to stage performances on weddings, company parties, and other events. They expand their traditional roles even further and even provide a sort of religious services based on old folk rituals, even though they are not in any way priests. They have also performed outside Japan. Another group \"Adachi\" in Fukuoka was formed five years ago and is still doing a good business, including new attractions as for example playing the saxophone while riding the unicycle, or displaying juggling, and balloon modelling performances.\n\nSince 1955, a national contest of chindon bands has been held in Toyama-shi. Each April, dozens of groups join together to perform and compete.\n\nMany \"chindon'ya\" also use the internet to advertise for their services.\n\n\"Chindon'ya\" are a small number of artists and musicians, both male and female. They are made up of usually at least three people, with some larger groups including 7 people. The first person in the group is called \"hatamochi\" or \"hatadori\", carrying the flag and handing out leaflets. This person is followed by the \"oyakata\", who usually carries the chindon drum and a large paper umbrella. As the drum weighs up to 15 kg, this is the most physically demanding job. Some references call the \"hatamochi\" the group leader, while other references call the \"oyakata\" the group leader. The third person used to play the shamisen, but may nowadays also use the drum and hence is the \"doramuya\". He is followed by one or more \"gakkiya\" that play wind instruments.\n\nThey are dressed in colorful clothes, usually in an eccentric version of traditional Japanese clothes. Women may be dressed up like a Geisha, with heavy make up. Men usually have their hair in a top knot, although nowadays they are usually wigs, and some may wear fancy hats. They parade through the streets playing various instruments, including both traditional Japanese instruments and western instruments. Usually, one person carries a combined instrument consisting of a small gong (giving the \"chin\" sound in \"chindon'ya\") and two small drums (giving the \"don\" sound in \"cindonya\"). Additional instruments by other performers may include a larger drum and a woodwind instrument, as for example a clarinet, a trumpet or a saxophone. They often play traditional Japanese tunes, military marches, or jazz.\n\nThrough their performance they try to attract attention to themselves, and more importantly, to the advertising signs and banners they are carrying. These may be boards hanging on the back of the performers or banners and flags hanging from large poles on the back of the performers. Some even carried umbrellas with advertising messages. They advertise for new shops, special sales in shops, the opening of a gaming parlor or pachinko parlors, or for cabarets. They may also distribute flyers.\n\nNowadays, a performer earns around 15.000 yen per day (roughly US 150), working from around 10:30 to 17:00. Hence a typical group of three to four people costs around 45.000 to 60.000 yen per day (roughly US 450 to 600). Only an estimated 10%-20% of the acts are ordered by shops, most performances are at festivals and private parties.\n\n\"Chindonya\" also is a colloquial derogatory term meaning \"an elaborate showy parade or scene made specifically to divert attention away from some scam\", as in \"Nani Kono Chindonya\" (\"What the hell are they trying to pull?\") It can be applied to anything nowadays, but especially politics and commerce. It references to the commonly held view that Chindonya were very low status, very poor and, therefore, untrustworthy.\n\n\n"}

The show is a web spinoff/tie-in to the series \"On Cinema at the Cinema\" and began on July 17, 2014. Many recurring jokes and the personas and mutual antipathies expressed by Decker and Kington carry over from the relationship of the \"real\" actors, Heidecker and Turkington, in \"On Cinema\".\n\nThe series is a spoof of action films, with intentionally bad production for comedic effect.

In response, Heidecker and Turkington started \"Decker-Con\", where new episodes of \"Decker\" are screened and the cast appears as their \"On Cinema\" characters, meeting and talking to fans.\n\nInitially a Adultswim.com series, it was announced to be moving to TV on December 17, 2015, and its fourth season premiered on June 17, 2016, on Adult Swim.

In his quest to save America, Decker is aided by the CIA's \"master of codes\", the movie-obsessed Jonathan Kington (Turkington), whose name is frequently mispronounced as either Kingston or Klington.\n\nThe series is a tie-in to \"On Cinema\", acting as the passion project of the fictional version of Tim Heidecker. In the series, the production is extremely low quality, with CGI errors, notably overt political grandstanding, very low quality animations, misquotes and bad editing, all for comedic effect. The series is also party to overdrawn scenes, such as in season 2, where the main character sings \"Our Values Are Under Attack,\" a partisan political song created by Tim. As the series progressed, more CGI was used, but used ineffectively, where sometimes effects would seem unfinished.\n\n\n\nHeidecker has said of production that there is, to an extent, purposefully little preparation in the process to make the show appear as low-quality as possible, as well as stating: \"We'll also go off-script and rant a bit to get everyone confused.” \n\n"}

{"id": "2019991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019991", "title": "Horace series", "text": "Horace series\n\nThe Horace video game series was created in the 1980s by William Tang for Beam Software. The series comprised \"Hungry Horace\", \"Horace Goes Skiing\" and \"Horace and the Spiders\".\n\n\"Hungry Horace\" and \"Horace and the Spiders\" were two of the few ZX Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2.\n\nThe original Horace game, \"Hungry Horace\" was written as a simple \"Pac-Man\" clone, published in 1982. In it, Horace must gather food from around a park and move onto the next section while avoiding park guards. It is possible for him to collect a bell to panic the guards and render them vulnerable, like the power pills in \"Pac-Man\". This title was available on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Dragon 32. The ZX Spectrum original was marketed and distributed by Sinclair themselves, the Commodore 64 and Dragon 32 versions by Melbourne House.\n\nThe Commodore 64 version also included a level editor which allowed the game owner to create, edit and save to cassette tape their own levels of the game. These could be shared with other owners of the game.\n\nA DOS-hosted level editor was written for the ZX Spectrum version in 2009.\nIn 1982 Tang also produced \"Horace Goes Skiing\", in which Horace must cross a dangerous road teeming with traffic, à la \"Frogger\", to rent out a pair of skis, then get back over the road and successfully navigate a ski course.\n\nThis title is not a true sequel, as it does not follow on from an original story and is only similar in that it features the same character. Like \"Hungry Horace\", this title was available on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Dragon 32. As before, Sinclair distributed the Spectrum version, Melbourne House the Commodore 64 and Dragon 32 versions. In 2017, the game placed on Eurogamer's \"10 games that defined the ZX Spectrum\" list.\nIn 1983, Tang produced the third title in the series, \"Horace and the Spiders\". This was primarily a platform game with the Horace sprite retained from the first two games. The first level sees Horace climbing a hill while jumping over spiders. The second level involves crossing a bridge by swinging on spider threads. The third level is the final confrontation with the spiders – he must create holes in the web, luring the spiders into the holes to fix them and consequently jumping on them.\n\nUnlike the earlier two titles, this game was only released for the ZX Spectrum. The first stage of this game shared similarities with both \"Pitfall\" and the Colecovision game \"\", whilst the third platform stage is essentially a \"Space Panic\" clone.\nThis title was announced in 1985 but the game never appeared, due to the author Tang suffering a collapsed lung and being unable to continue.\nHorace made a comeback in 1995 with the platform based game \"Horace in the Mystic Woods\" for the Psion 3-Series of palmtop computers. This fourth entry in the Horace series is a platform game split into one-screen levels in the style of \"Manic Miner\" and was coded by Michael Ware of Proteus Developments. It is Series 3a/3c and 3mx compatible.\n\nIn 2010, a conversion of the game to the ZX Spectrum was released by indie coder Bob Smith.\nIn the Spectrum version of the 1987 game \"Inspector Gadget and the Circus of Fear\", Gadget has to make his way through several scrolling worlds. In the first of these, he is hindered by Horaces travelling in the opposite direction; if he trips over too many of them, he loses a life.\n\nA reference to Horace is also present in the 2003 PlayStation 2 game \"Dog's Life\", which features a shop named \"Horace's Ski Shop\". The name is written in a font similar to the one used on the ZX Spectrum, and is accompanied by a Spectrum-style rainbow pattern.\n\n"}

In the case of producing and allocating public/private goods, solution concepts are focused on finding dominant strategies.\n\nIn his paper \"Counterspeculation, Auctions, and Competitive Sealed Tenders,\" William Vickrey showed that if preferences are restricted to the case of quasi-linear utility functions then the mechanism dominant strategy is dominant-strategy implementable. \"A social choice rule is dominant strategy incentive compatible, or strategy-proof, if the associated revelation mechanism has the property that honestly reporting the truth is always a dominant strategy for each agent.\" However, the payments to agents become large, sacrificing budget neutrality to incentive compatibility.\n\nIn a game where multiple agents are to report their preferences (or their type), it may be in the best interest of some agents to lie about their preferences. This may improve their payoff, but it may not be seen as a fair outcome to other agents.\n\nAlthough largely theoretical, implementation theory may have profound implications on policy creation because some social choice rules may be impossible to implement under specific game conditions.\n"}
{"id": "700578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=700578", "title": "José Jiménez (character)", "text": "José Jiménez (character)\n\nJosé Jiménez was a fictional character created and performed by comedian Bill Dana on \"The Steve Allen Show\" in 1959 and who became increasingly popular during the 1960s. This character introduced himself with the catch phrase: \"My name... José Jiménez\". Dana played José in three non-variety shows: \"Make Room For Daddy\", which spun off \"The Bill Dana Show\", and a cameo in an episode of \"Batman\" (\"The Yegg Foes in Gotham\", October 20, 1966).\n\nDuring the course of his José Jiménez acts, Bill Dana (who was of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry, unlike the Bolivian character he played) took his character through various roles including elevator operator, sailor, and submariner until settling into the most famous occupation that José would hold: astronaut.\n\n<poem>José Jiménez: \"My name... José Jiménez.\"\nEd Sullivan: \"Well, now I see you have some of your space equipment with you. Uh, what is that called, the crash helmet?\"\nJosé Jiménez: \"Oh, I hope not.\"</poem>\n\n<poem>Ed Sullivan: \"Now, what do you consider the most important thing in rocket travel?\"\nJosé Jiménez: \"To me the most important thing in the rocket travel is the blast-off.\"\nEd Sullivan: \"The blast-off.\"\nJosé Jiménez: \"I always take a blast before I take off. Otherwise I wouldn't go near that thing.\"</poem>\n\nThe routine was later released as a double-sided single: \"The Astronaut (Part 1 and 2)\" made the \"Billboard\" charts, peaking at #19 in September 1961. Writer/producer Don Hinkley (who Dana had met when they were writers for the Allen show) played the part of the newscaster, asking José questions about his purported spaceflight. An LP, \"José Jiminez in Orbit (Bill Dana on Earth)\" (Kapp KL-1257), featuring similar routines, was issued in 1962.\n\nThe character of José Jiménez caught on with the seven real Mercury astronauts, and Dana became good friends with them: \"Okay, José, you're on your way!\" Deke Slayton quipped as Alan Shepard's famous first flight launched. José became the program's unofficial mascot, and Dana was even made an honorary Mercury astronaut. (Coincidentally, there was a real test pilot named Bill Dana, who flew as high as 59 miles up and qualified for NASA's Astronaut Badge.)\n\nAs time passed, Dana realized that such ethnic humor was becoming offensive, and Hispanic groups began protesting Dana's portrayal of the dim-witted Hispanic character. In 1970, Dana announced to ten thousand Mexican-Americans attending a cultural pride festival that \"after tonight, José Jiménez is dead\", later holding a mock funeral for José on Sunset Boulevard. In 1997 Dana received an image award from the National Hispanic Media Coalition.\n\nIn the 1983 film \"The Right Stuff\", Alan Shepard (played by Scott Glenn) is a fan of the character and uses the catchphrase in radio talk while piloting his airplane in for a carrier landing. Later he is warned by a very large, rather intimidating Hispanic medical aide (played by Anthony Muñoz) that the way he uses it is offending people, and he stops. Footage of the character's appearance as an astronaut on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" was also seen in the film.\n\nIn the 1987 film \"The Pink Chiquitas\", one of the characters reads a passage from a book describing an expedition by the \"explorer\" José Jiménez.\n\nIn his demo of the song \"Wonderful Toys\" written for the aborted Batman musical, Jim Steinman does a parody of Eminem, which includes the lines \"My name is—my name is—my names is—José Jiménez!\". The song is meant to be sung by The Joker.\n\nIn the \"Farscape\" season 4 episode, \"Unrealized Reality\", the lead character, John Crichton (who commonly quotes pop culture throughout his misadventures), experiences another possible reality of a scene from the first episode of the series. When asked his name, instead of saying John Crichton he replies, \"My name José Jiménez.\"\n\nIn the television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", the puppet character of Crow uses the phrase \"My name José Jiménez.\"\n\nIn the third episode of the HBO miniseries \"From the Earth to the Moon\", called \"We Have Cleared the Tower\", someone mentions Bill Dana during the Apollo 7 pre-launch breakfast. This inspires Commander Wally Schirra (played by Mark Harmon) to recite some of José Jiménez's lines, to the great amusement of everyone at the table.\n\nIn a cameo appearance in the \"Get Smart\" episode, \"Supersonic Boom\", Dana alludes indirectly to Jiménez, in that his only line was \"Sorry fella, don't speak Spanish. Boy, are you in the wrong neighborhood.\"\n\nIn season 4 episode 10 of \"The Larry Sanders Show\", Arthur argues that José had been an inspiration to children because he was the \"first Hispanic in space\".\n\nIn the episode \"Day One\" of \"The Wonder Years\", Kevin Arnold's teacher calls him, \" \"a regular José Jiménez\" when Kevin interrupts a class lecture. Earlier in the episode Kevin made a joke and embarrassed the same teacher.\n\n"}

{"id": "301264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301264", "title": "Marionette", "text": "Marionette\n\nA marionette is a puppet controlled from above using wires or strings depending on regional variations. A marionette's puppeteer is called a marionettist. Marionettes are operated with the puppeteer hidden or revealed to an audience by using a vertical or horizontal control bar in different forms of theatres or entertainment venues. They have also been used in films and on television. The attachment of the strings varies according to its character or purpose.\n\nIn French, \"marionette\" means \"little Mary\". In France, during the Middle Ages, string puppets were often used to depict biblical events, with the Virgin Mary being a popular character, hence the name. Additionally, one of the first figures to be made into a marionette was the Virgin Mary.\n\nIn France, the word \"marionette\" can refer to any kind of puppet, but elsewhere it typically refers only to string puppets.\n\nPuppetry is an ancient form of performance. Some historians claim that they predate actors in theatre. There is evidence that they were used in Egypt as early as 2000 BC when string-operated figures of wood were manipulated to perform the action of kneading bread, and other string-controlled objects. Wire-controlled, articulated puppets made of clay and ivory have been found in Egyptian tombs. Marionette puppetry was used to display rituals and ceremonies using these string-operated figurines back in ancient times and is used today.\n\nPuppetry was practiced in Ancient Greece and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of Herodotus and Xenophon, dating from the 5th century BC. The Greek word translated as \"puppet\" is \"νευρόσπαστος\" (\"nevróspastos\"), which literally means \"drawn by strings, string-pulling\", from \"νεῦρον\" (\"nevron\"), meaning either \"sinew, tendon, muscle, string\", or \"wire\", and \"σπάω\" (\"spáō\"), meaning \"draw, pull\".\n\nAristotle (384–322 BC) discusses puppets in his work \"On the Motion of Animals\":\nThe movements of animals may be compared with those of automatic puppets, which are set going on the occasion of a tiny movement; the levers are released, and strike the twisted strings against one another.\n\nArchimedes is known to have worked with marionettes. Plato's work also contains references to puppetry. The \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" were presented using puppetry. The roots of European puppetry probably extend back to the Greek plays with puppets played to the \"common people\" in the 5th century BC. By the 3rd century BC these plays would appear in the Theatre of Dionysus at the Acropolis.\n\nIn ancient Greece and Rome clay and ivory dolls, dated from around 500 BC, were found in children's tombs. These dolls had articulated arms and legs, some of which had an iron rod extending up from the tops of their heads. This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, exactly as is done today in Sicilian puppetry. A few of these dolls had strings in place of the rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were mere toys and not puppets due to their small size.\n\nThe Indian word \"sutradhara\", from \"sutra\", refers to the show-manager of theatrical performances (or a puppet-player), and also means literally \"string-puller\" or \"string-holder\".\n\nThe sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes from the Frankish romantic poems, such as \"The Song of Roland\". These same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood, an art form called \"L'Opera deî Pupi\" (\"Opera of the puppets\") in Sicilian. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorî (singers of tales) are rooted in the Provençal troubadour tradition in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this marionette art is the puppet theatres of Palermo, Sicily.\n\nIn the 18th century, operas were specifically composed for marionettes. Mozart as a child had seen marionettes. Gluck, Haydn, de Falla and Respighi all composed adult operas for marionettes. Lewis Carroll composed marionette operas and plays for his siblings' entertainment. Today in Salzburg in Austria, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre still continues the tradition of presenting full-length opera using marionettes in their own theatre.\n\nThe \"Opera dei Pupi\", Sicilian puppet theatre, was relisted on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008.\n\nMarionettes are sometimes referred to as \"puppets\", but the term \"marionettes\" is more precise, distinguishing them from other forms of puppetry, such as finger, glove, rod and shadow puppetry.\n\nIn the UK the renaissance of Marionettes during the late 19th and early 20th century was driven by W. H. Whanslaw and Waldo Lanchester, two of the co-founders of the \"British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild\". The only purpose-built UK marionette theatre is \"The Harlequin Puppet Theatre\" (built 1958) in Rhos on Sea, North Wales, Founded by Eric Bramall FRSA and continued by Chris Somerville. Other theatres that occasionally perform with marionettes are the Little Angel Theatre founded by John and Lyndie Wright in Islington, London, Whose first ever show \"The Wild Night Of The Witches\" was a marionette play, It opened the theatre in 1961 and was revived for the 50th anniversary in 2011 The Norwich Puppet Theatre founded by Ray & Joan DaSilva sometimes present marionette shows and the Puppet Theatre Barge continue to perform using long string marionettes throughout the year, founded by Gren Middleton and Juliet Rogers. The barge is based in Little Venice, London during the winter months and tours to places such as Richmond Upon Thames during the summer.\n\nIn Scotland, Dr Malcolm Knight has championed the art form and over the last 25 years the Scottish Mask and Puppet Centre has acted as a catalyst, a lead agency, and as a resource centre for all those with an interest in mask and puppet theatre.\n\nIn Germany, the Augsburger Puppenkiste since 1948 has produced theatrical adaptations of fairy tales and serious pieces. In 1953, it began producing television series with productions such as \"Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivführer\" and \"Urmel aus dem Eis\".\n\nIn Austria the Salzburg Marionette Theatre was founded in 1913 by Professor Anton Aicher. Aicher was heavily influenced by Count Franz Pocci who founded the Munich Marionette Theatre in Germany in 1855. Until 2012, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre was under the artistic direction of his granddaughter, Gretl Aicher, who commented on her lasting interest in marionettes, \"What then is the fascination of a life with marionettes? Is it the pleasure of performing? The appeal of mastering an 'instrument' to the point of virtuosity? The transformation of one's own self? For me, it is the process of empathizing with mind and soul, of feeling at one with music and movement that bring these much loved creatures to life. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre performs mainly operas such as \"Die Fledermaus\" and \"The Magic Flute\" and a small number of ballets such as \"The Nutcracker\". The Salzburg Marionette Theatre productions are aimed for adults although children are welcome. There is also a marionette theatre at Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna. Marionette theatre also had a very long history in entertainment in Prague,\n\nIn the Czech Republic Marionette theatre has a very long history in entertainment in Prague, An important organisation is the National Marionette Theatre. Its repertoire mainly features a marionette production of Mozart's famous \"Don Giovanni\". The production has period costumes and a beautifully designed 18th-century setting. There are numerous other companies including, Buchty a Loutky (\"Cakes and Puppets\") founded by Marek Bečka. \"Rocky IX\" and \"Tibet\" are just two works in the repertoire.\n\nIn Australia, like in many other countries, there is a continuing tradition of marionette puppetry. Norman Hetherington OAM, Peter Scriven, founder of the Marionette Theatre of Australia, Richard Bradshaw OAM and David Splatt (Smallpox Theatre) are notable puppeteers.\n\nIn Picardy, Lafleur is a marionette from Amiens. The \"Cabotans d'Amiens\" are hand carved, using wood, with a central rod and strings for the arms and legs. In France, the most famous puppet is the Guignol which is a hand puppet created in Lyon in 1808.\n\nIn the United States, several groups have established permanent theatres or touring programs dedicated to spotlighting marionette performances. The Cole Marionettes were founded by George and Lucille Cole in Chicago circa 1934. The Bob Baker Marionette Theater in Los Angeles is now considered a historical landmark, presented a variety of cabaret marionette shows. The Puppetworks theatre in New York under the direction of Nick Coppola has been in operation since 1980. The Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta develops and fosters marionette performers from across the globe. Le Theatre de Marionette in Dallas has recreated a traditional marionette theatre with puppeteer bridge and full stage productions. The theatre is open year-round. The National Marionette Theater with David Syrotiak at its helm has developed some of the most artistically staged shows to grace the American stage. The Fratello Marionettes, with its founder Kevin Menegus of Danville, California are wonderful marionette creators and performers, with shows that are well crafted and display an almost Disney-esque quality. The Bil Baird theatre in Greenwich Village closed in 1987 but was a nationally recognized treasure that presented countless shows to families for over a decade, including their contribution to film and television with the famous Lonely Goatherd scene from \"The Sound of Music\". The Frisch Marionettes in Cincinnati also produce some of the best marionettes and manipulation in performances today. Kevin Frisch has been considered one of the best stage marionette artists performing in his time and his puppet creations are meticulously lifelike. His manipulation and ability to transfer lifelike movement to the inanimate has been compared to the German master puppeteer, Albrecht Roser. Joseph Cashore has been touring the United States for over 30 years with a collection of self-designed marionettes.\n\nWith the rise in popularity of television and film, marionettes found a rise in popularity especially in children's programming. The story of Pinocchio and its Disney adaptation (\"Pinocchio\"), which was released in 1940, is a story about a marionette. In 1947, \"Howdy Doody\" introduced marionettes to children's television, with Howdy Doody (the main character) being a marionette, as well as some other characters.\n\nIn the 1950s, Bil Baird and Cora Eisenberg presented a great number of marionette shows for television, and were also responsible for the Lonely Goatherd sequence from the classic film \"The Sound of Music\". Bil Baird also wrote a classic book on his work. In Australia, a program called \"Mr. Squiggle\", using a marionette central character of the same name, ran for just over 40 years (1959–1999). Another program for children using puppetry was the \"Magic Circle Club\" featuring puppets Cassius Cuckoo and Leonardo de Funbird.\n\nFrom the 1940s onwards, the BBC in the United Kingdom, produced a wide series of marionette programmes for children and then created The \"BBC Television Puppet Theatre\" based in \"Lime Grove Studios\" from 1955–1964, Usually under the title \"Watch With Mother\" The various programmes included \"Whirligig\", \"The Woodentops\", \"Bill and Ben\", \"Muffin The Mule\", \"Rubovia\" a series created by Gordon Murray and \"Andy Pandy\". Later in the 1960s, Gerry Anderson with his wife, Sylvia Anderson and colleagues made a number of hit series, \"Fireball XL5\", \"Stingray\" and \"Thunderbirds\", which pioneered a technique combining marionettes and electronics. This allowed for radio control moving of the mouth of a marionettes. The technique was patented and called \"supermarionation\". The programs have been shown all around the world and are now widely distributed on DVD. Anderson also made two films, \"Thunderbirds Are Go\" and \"Thunderbird 6\". During the 1970s in the UK TV series using marionettes include \"The Adventures of Rupert Bear\", \"Mumfie\" and \"Cloppa Castle\". Some marionettes appear in \"Pipkins\" namely Octavia Ostrich.\nMore recently marionettes are starting to re emerge on the TV screen, \"Coca-Cola\" have used marionettes to create a series of adverts based in an office and music videos use them regularly as metaphors.\n\nMarionettes are featured in the 1999 film, \"Being John Malkovich\". John Cusack played a manipulator who referred to himself as a puppeteer.\n\nThe BBC children's show \"Playbus\" (later \"Playdays\") used many puppets during their commission, notably a singing and dancing marionette called Lizzie Dreams, sometimes paired up with another marionette called Nick.\n\n\"\" is a 2004 movie made by \"South Park\" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker which uses a crude, naive, child like style of supermarionation as in \"Thunderbirds\". Matt Stone and Trey Parker dubbed their version \"Supercrappymation\" due to the fact they intentionally left the strings visible among other reasons.\n\nAlso appearing in 2004 was the full-length, award-winning marionette fantasy film \"Strings\", directed by Dane Anders Rønnow Klarlund.\n\nA marionette was also used in the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Shakespeare Code\".\n\nThis type of control has many strings attached to a rounded rectangular paddle with a short handle, all the strings are attached and hang from the outer edge of the paddle and are used by selecting each string with the opposite hand and pulling to control the figure which hangs below.\n\nThis control is a bar which is held in the hand in a horizontal plane. There can be numerous bars at right angles to the central bar, which in turn attaches via wires to the hands, shoulders, back, etc. A smaller plate is usually hung under the main bar, and this carries the head strings; likewise, a detachable clip usually holds the leg bar. This style of control is generally used in the USA for human figures and is also known as the American control. A similar control is almost universally used for quadruped animals; as it emulates the basic shape of the animal, rocking it from side to side will control the leg movements in unison. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre in Austria also uses a variant of this style for its human characters.\n\nThis type of control is an upright bar which has various smaller bars inserted at right angles from which the head, shoulder, back etc. strings etc. are attached to. This control usually has a detachable leg bar which controls walking when held in the opposite hand. The arms are controlled by wires which are inserted into a hole in the shaft bent at approximately 45 degrees to the shaft and hang loosely with a loop at the end to attach the hand strings, these are then moved by the fingers holding the main shaft. A tilt of the main upright, controls the head and body with a fine nuance, This type of control is usually called the British control.\nAnother variation of the vertical control is found in Europe usually a rigid wire rod extends from the centre of the head upwards and fixed rigidly to the control, The leg bar is inserted through the main upright but pivots on a pin to allow movement of the legs.\n\nSicilian marionettes are among the simplest marionettes to operate. They are usually carved out of wood and have a sturdy rod which extends up through the body into the head. This rod, and one string attached to the hand, controls the manipulation of the puppet.\n\nCzech rod marionettes are similar to Sicilian ones though they are more complex. They are hand carved, usually using lime wood. The marionettes have the central rod like the Sicilian marionette but also have strings for the arms and legs. Sometimes they also use string to control a mouth or movable ears. These require more skilled manipulation. Czechs also have marionettes that have no central rod and strings that are attached to the head, shoulders and back. These are the most difficult marionettes to manipulate due to the absence of the central rod. Miroslav Trejtnar is an acknowledged master puppeteer and teacher of traditional Czech marionette making skills.\n\nBurmese marionettes are all string operated and are a popular art in Burma. Marionettes are called Yoke thé (lit. miniatures) and are almost always performed in operas. A Burmese marionette troupe must have 27 characters, including a king, animals such as horse, elephant, tiger, monkey and parrot, ministers, prince and princess and buffoons A hsaing waing, a traditional Burmese orchestra usually provides the music. Burmese marionettes are very intricate and dexterous as they employ 18 (for male characters) or 19 (for female) wires, each puppet controlled only by one puppeteer.\n\n\n\n"}

Flood was an I.T. analyst for Westpac bank at the time of winning \"Millionaire\". He lives in New South Wales and retired from working altogether six months after the big win.\n\nHarbouring an ambition to become a quiz champion, he studied general knowledge intensively for five years before appearing on the show, collecting information from trivia nights and also analysing past episodes of the show.\n\nFlood was the second person to win the $1,000,000 major prize on the Australian version of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\", after Rob \"Coach\" Fulton. He won the prize on the 14 November 2005 episode after being asked: \"Who was never Time Magazine Man of the Year?\" A - Adolf Hitler, B - Ayatollah Khomeini, C - Joseph Stalin or D - Mao Zedong. The answer was Mao Zedong. He answered the question only after using his final lifeline, the 50/50. \n\nHis appearance on \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" spawned some controversies, as it was marred by suggestions that he may have cheated. The program launched an investigation following complaints from audience members about coughing in the audience. The Nine Network's \"A Current Affair\" focused on a moment when an audience member coughed as Flood mentioned an answer (creating links to convicted English quiz show cheat Charles Ingram) and on suggestions that Flood was behaving erratically. Flood, who was unaware of the suggestion until after taping the second episode on which he appeared, was publicly cleared by the network of any improper conduct.\n\nFlood was the last winner of the original incarnation of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" in Australia. Six further contestants, who then appeared on the \"Hot Seat\" edition of the show, attempted to succeed him as Australia's Millionaire, and all six failed (the most recent of which was Kevin Short in 2013). That was until 2016 however, when Edwin Daly, a 67-year-old retiree from South Australia, managed to correctly answer the fifteenth and final question for the first time in almost 11 years.\n\nFlood was a key member of Australian quiz show \"The Master\", which aired on the Seven Network on 16 August 2006 and was cancelled after the first episode. Flood played the role of \"The Master\", competing against contestants to thwart their attempts to win a $1 million prize. The show was brought back in December (after the 2006 ratings period had ended) with the six remaining produced episodes going to air at an earlier timeslot of Monday nights at 7:30pm (which \"The Weakest Link\" had previously occupied from 2001 to early 2002).\n\nFlood also participated in this special show which was part of a series spin-off of \"Australia's Brainiest\" but did not make it past the second round.

It was the original super heavyweight title of Wellington Pro Wrestling and introduced as the WPW Super Heavyweight Championship on 3 December 2004. The inaugural champion was Ruamoko, who defeated Les Barrett in a tournament final in Lower Hutt, New Zealand on 25 April 1992. The title became vacant when Ruamoko suffered an injury in early-2005 and, after the promotion became New Zealand Wide Pro Wrestling, it was replaced by the current heavyweight championship first won by Island Boy Si on 25 March 2005. The current champion is Axl in his first reign. \n\nOn 17 November 2018 at Capital Pro Wrestling's MitchellMania event, NZWPW owner Martin Stirling was seen taking the NZWPW Heavyweight Championship from the then current champion Bryant. Bryant was told by Stirling that he took it for \"maintenance\".\n\nThe following Tuesday NZWPW announced on its Facebook page that Bryant's as well as the previous champion, Wayne La Perfeccion's reigns are not official. The reason given by NZWPW was that title changes after \"Dreamcatcher\" Phil Woodgate left as CWO are no longer official. \n\nTherefore, the following 2 championship reigns were previously recognised, but are no longer recognised by the promotion as of 20 November 2018:\n\n"}

Its mandate was to carry out “educational work for farmers, school children, factory workers and other classes,” to promote the province and its resources and “to encourage the building of highways and other public works.”\n\nInitially, the Bureau hired private film companies in Toronto to produce films under its editorial control. By 1923, the OMPB acquired its own studio, in Trenton, Ontario, previously owned by Adanac Films, and began producing its own educational films distributing 1,500 reels monthly by 1925. These films were mostly screened in churches, schools and community institutions.\n\nBy the late 1920s, its films were increasingly viewed as outdated, while the Bureau itself was being criticised as having a large and unwieldy bureaucracy. It was dissolved on October 26, 1934 by the new Liberal government of Mitchell Hepburn, who had pledged during the 1934 provincial election to cut the size of government. The Bureau's property in Trenton was donated as a community hall.\n\n"}

From the 5 century BC sacred prostitution took place at the temple. Every woman in the land was expected to make a journey to the temple once in her lifetime and have sex in exchange for money in the temple grounds.\n\nFollowing the island coming under control of the British, prostitutes were required to be registered. In the Larnaca Town Museum the 1916 registration book is on display, which contains photographs of the town's prostitutes. Brothels were outlawed by the Governor, Ronald Storrs, in 1931, but there were exceptions during WW2 for the use of allied troops.\n\nIn an effort to reduce the spread of STIs, the Army Medical Corps introduced a card system for prostitutes. In 1941 300 cards were issued. The prostitutes had to have a daily health check, and if clear of infections the card was stamped. If infected the women were treated and their card was withheld until they were cleared of the infection. Prophylactic centres were set up for the troops to attend prior to visiting the brothels where they were issued condoms.\n\nIn 1942 it was estimated that there were 740 prostitutes working on the island, mainly in Nicosia, Famagusta and Limassol. Every major town except Kyrenia had a venereal clinic. 12 prophylactic centres were established and a 200 bed venereal ward at Nicosia General Hospital.\n\nCyprus is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women, primarily from Eastern Europe, Vietnam, India, and sub-Saharan Africa, are subjected to sex trafficking. Sex trafficking occurs in private apartments and hotels, on the street, and within commercial sex outlets in Cyprus including bars, pubs, coffee shops, and cabarets. Some female sex trafficking victims are recruited with false promises of marriage or work as barmaids or hostesses. Unaccompanied children, children of migrants, Romani, and asylum-seekers are especially vulnerable to sex trafficking.\n\nLaw 60(I) of 2014 prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment. The government investigated 13 suspects for sex trafficking in 2016 (seven in 2015).\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Cyprus as a 'Tier 1' country.\n\nThe Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is only recognised as a separate state by Turkey. Prostitution is illegal, however in nightclubs, \"konsomatrices\", who sit with, eat with or entertain customers for money are allowed. Konsomatrices are not allowed to have sex with customers, but this restriction is frequently flouted. In 2016, authorities issued 1,314 six-month “hostess” and “barmaid” work permits for individuals working in nightclubs and two pubs operating in the north. During this period, 351 women worked under such permits. Nightclub owners hired female college students during this period to bypass the cap on the number of employees legally permitted in each club and avoid taxes and monitoring. Enforcement is generally lax, but in July 2006 the Nicosia District Court ordered the first prostitution-related imprisonment. After pleading no contest to the charges, the manager of Mexico nightclub, Mesut Kilicarslan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison for encouraging and profiting from prostitution. By the year's end three more suspects were sentenced to imprisonment for encouraging and profiting from prostitution.\n\nNGOs reported a number of women entered the “TRNC” on three-month tourist or student visas and engaged in prostitution in apartments in north Nicosia, Kyrenia, and Famagusta.\n\nNorthern Cyprus has become a destination for sex tourism.\n\nThe area is increasingly a destination for women from Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa who are subjected to forced prostitution in nightclubs licensed and regulated by the Turkish Cypriot administration. Nightclubs provide a significant source of tax revenue for the Turkish Cypriot administration; media reports estimated nightclub owners pay between 20 and 30 million Turkish lira ($5.7-8.5 million) in taxes annually.\n\nAs the TRNC is not recognised by the US, the United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons does not give the area a country ranking. If it did it would be Tier 3.\n"}

Its tag line is \"EXPAND Your Fantasy\". Red Light Center is modeled after Amsterdam’s Red Light District. The online community site offers users virtual nightclubs, hotels, bars, movie theaters and stores. There is a virtual currency called Rays, which members can earn and use for services in the community, Zaby apartments, Gifts for other members, and various other purposes. Rays can also be sold on an open Marketplace for real currency.\n\nThe last press release noting RLC membership, in March 2008, estimated the registered userbase at over 1.5 million.\n\nA player can own their own Zaby apartment within the 3D World. It is possible to install televisions with streaming video, or a jukebox with music. One can color the walls, and place furniture. The Zaby apartments vary in size from a small one-bedroom apartment to a large country house.\n\nThere are other worlds attached to Red Light Center, the largest of which being Virtual Vancouver, modeled on the city of Vancouver, which includes notable landmarks and buildings. Virtual Vancouver hosts Art Gallery shows, streaming concerts, book festivals, and other cultural events.\n\nRed Light Center offers Community Events, such as classes, meeting rooms, live music with dancing and art-gallery openings. Users also have the ability to put on their own events. In many locations, one can smoke hookahs of ganja and eat magic mushrooms, which can have their effects shaken off at the user's choice.\n\nAs an adult playground, RLC features a sex function for VIP members. The users are represented by avatars, which may be customized personally to suit a user's tastes, and may be used to have virtual sex with another. Certain areas of RLC provide a bed for the users and cater to various popular fantasies. Users have access to underwater caves, locker rooms, a hotel, and bordello rooms, all of which are private spots. There are several themed and equipped rooms available for BDSM play. The avatars are all anatomically correct and the sexual activity is detailed and animated. Users choose a position or action from a menu and then watch it happen with their avatar partner. Since both partners have the same menu to choose from, the result is a visual cybersex.\n\nWithin the RLC metaverse, there are several roles and functions which are provided solely by currently active members of the RLC community.\n\n\"Working Girls/Guys\" are members that are allowed to sell sexual services for in-game currency, which can be exchanged for U.S. dollars.\n\n\"Guides\" have the role of helping new members learn their way around, giving tours, answering questions, and helping with minor disputes.\n\n\"Greeters\" take over where the guides leave off. The job of greeters is to make new members feel welcome and to ensure that everyone has a good time. Greeters help the members have a good time and party. They introduce new members to other members so they will get to know people sooner. Greeters are a staff position. Ambassadors are the volunteer counterparts.\n\nThe next role is \"Leader\", which is a promotion for those guides who have shown themselves to be seriously dedicated to helping the community. They now have the added responsibility of helping the guides, trying to settle disputes, and assisting the protectors in any way they can.\n\nA \"Protector\" is the highest role that most members can reach. This is someone who has proven themselves to be very dedicated to the community; they are essentially moderators. Protectors are entrusted with helping the guides, leaders, and all the other members. Protectors step into situations that the leaders or others can't get under control. Protectors try to reason with members, and if after an ample amount of time and warnings, booting a member if needed.\n\n\"Community Supervisor\" is in charge of helping, training, and moderating the guides, recommending promotions, as well as assisting the leaders. They are protectors or leaders who have been promoted to this leadership position. They have the same roles as the leaders and guides, but with these added responsibilities. They also work closely with the protectors and Community Moderators.\n\n\"Community Moderator\" was created in tandem with the growing number of members joining the community. In addition to being protectors, community moderators are there to assist everyone. They help guides, leaders, and protectors with any problems or complaints they may have, and act as a main pipeline to the higher staff. They also help with members' complaints and problems. This position has all but been replaced by the Staff Moderators.\n\n\"Staff Moderators\" are a special staff position created to ensure a better staff involvement with in-world issues. They oversee and assist the duties of both the Community Moderators and Supervisors, therefore assisting with the oversight of this branch of volunteers. They also provide a conduit between volunteers/members and higher staff as well as handle any in-world issues that need attention.\n\nEssentially, the \"Utherverse\" besides being the parent company is namely also the universe or \"Metaverse\" that engulfs all of the cities that make up the environment. Cities such as Red Light Center, Loki Land and Virtual Vancouver, while both a part of the big picture, are each separate entities connected to each other by \"transport centers\" linking them together.\n\nIn keeping with its suggestion that there should eventually be \"millions of worlds, all of them connected, searchable, and customized...\" the company claims it will license the use of its software infrastructure to anyone who wishes to create entire worlds on the scale of either of its existing properties, or much larger, on terms of a franchise. The company has recently released the groundwork for this with its Virtual World Web (VWW) option to its service. This enables any member to create a virtual world of their own for personal or business intent.\n\nThe Utherverse social center, is comparable to Myspace or Facebook but with less content limitation and with some dating flavor.\n\nFreedom of speech and expression, within the confines of the law, are a key factor to the concept's appeal. There is a rewards system namely an in-world currency, referred to as 'Rays', in memory of Ray Schwartz, the late co-founder of Utherverse, which pays you for browsing profiles, rating pictures, creating and selling clothing etc. This currency and the vast amount of creativity in the Utherverse is also the driving force of the in-world economy.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "59027902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59027902", "title": "Tancrède (tragedy)", "text": "Tancrède (tragedy)\n\n\" Tancrède \" is a tragedy in five acts by Voltaire that premiered on 3 September 1760.\nThe character names Tancrède and Aménaïde are taken from Torquato Tasso's \"Jerusalem Delivered\", but the plot does not owe anything to this work. The action takes place in the year 1005 in Norman-ruled Syracuse at the time Sicily was throwing off the rule of the Saracens. Aménaïde, daughter of Argire, is betrothed to Orbassan. However she loves Tancred, who has gone onto hiding after being placed under Imperial ban at the initiative of Orbassan. A letter from Aménaïde to Tancrède is intercepted and falsely said to be intended for the Saracen Solamir; she is then held prisoner until she can be tried. Tancrède, thinking he has been deceived by Aménaïde, seeks death in an attack on Solamir, whom he kills. As Tancrède too dies, Aménaïde declares her innocence and her love before escaping her father and dying of a broken heart next to Tancrède's body.\n\nIn 1759 there was a change in the practices of the Comédie-Française which Voltaire had long advocated - the removal of rows of spectators from the stage. This meant that for the first time the full width of the stage could be used; a grander spectacle could be presented, with more action in each scene. This change prompted Voltaire to write a drama that would take full advantage of these new performance conditions, creating an elaborate visual spectacle. Together with his emphasis on action rather than intense exploration of character, the play produced a somewhat operatic effect. Voltaire began work on the play in 1759 and claimed to have written it in just four weeks.\n\n\"Tancrède\" was a departure from some of the other norms of French tragedy established by Racine. Until 1760 all of Voltaire's tragedies had been written in rhyming Alexandrine couplets, the normal form of dramatic poetry in the French theatre of the time. \"Tancrède\" however was written in 'vers croisés' which gave the language a somewhat more natural and less declamatory quality. Voltaire also concentrated on filling the action with pathos, tenderness and chivalric sentiment. When Jean-François Marmontel visited Ferney before the manuscript was sent to the actors in Paris, Voltaire gave him a copy to read. When he returned it Voltaire said to him 'your tears tell me eloquently what I most desired to know.' As well as for its moving action, the play was noted for some particular instances of realism unusual at the time. For example after being arrested Aménaïde appeared on stage in fetters, and Tancrède actually threw down a gauntlet when he challenged Orbassan to combat.\n\nAfter initial rehearsals in Tournai there was a private performance at Voltaire's house theatre in Ferney in October 1759; following alterations the play had its public premiere on 13 September 1760. The premiere in the Comédie-Française with Lekain in the title role and Claire Clairon as Aménaïde was a success and prompted the creation of two parodies by Antoine-François Riccoboni in the Théâtre-Italien: \"La nouvelle joute\" and \"Quand parlera-t-elle?\" However as a result of various intrigues the play was taken off the stage after only thirteen performances. \n\nAs well as enjoying public success, \"Tancrède\" was also appreciated at court. When a play was required for the celebration of the wedding of the dauphin (the future Louis XVI) and Marie Antoinette in 1770, \"Tancrède\" was selected and performed. The accession of Louis XVI in 1775 thus offered Voltaire some hope that the court would no longer be so firmly opposed to his return to Paris. While the new king remained implacable however, Marie Antoinette was better disposed towards Voltaire and in 1776 she requested that Lekain perform \"Tancrède\" at court once again.\n\nDenis Diderot attended the premier and wrote to Voltaire afterwards with his critical views. He praised many aspects of the play, notably the third act; he admired the scene where Aménaïde faints when she unexpectedly sees Tancrède. He found the mute scene particularly powerful, because the acting alone, he felt, imparted the tragedy more effectively than words could have; it reminded him of Poussin's painting (es) . His main criticisms were around the reactions by two characters in the play which did not seem probable to him. The first was in Act 2 when Aménaïde's father Argire appears to have no qualms about agreeing that his daughter is a traitor and readily assenting to her punishment. 'Make him more of a father', he wrote to Voltaire. The other fault he found was in Act 4 where Aménaïde is indignant that Tancrède too is so ready to believe her a traitor; in Diderot's view she should have been able to better appreciate how matters appeared to him. Élie Catherine Fréron also praised the play, welcoming the feelings of chivalry which it inspired and describing it as a new kind of spectacle.\n\nDorothea Celesia produced an adaptation of \"Tancrède\" in English under the title \"Almida\" which was staged at Drury Lane in 1771. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published a German translation in 1802 and Gioacchino Rossini made his great international breakthrough with his opera \"Tancredi\" in 1813, inspired by Voltaire's tragedy.\n\nThe play was printed by Prault in 1760, together with a dedication by Voltaire to Madame de Pompadour, an admirer of Tasso. This dedication secured the assistance of Madame de Pompadour in ensuring that first minister Étienne-François de Choiseul allowed the book to be published. Numerous reprints and pirated prints followed immediately.\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "17572684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17572684", "title": "The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie", "text": "The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie\n\nSchir Johine the Ros, ane thing thair is compild, also known as \"The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie\", is the earliest surviving example of the Scottish version of the flyting genre in poetry. The genre takes the form of a contest, or \"war of words\", between two poets, each trying to outclass the other in vituperation and verbal pyrotechnics. It is not certain how the work was composed, but it is likely to have been publicly performed, probably in the style of a poetic joust by the two combatants, William Dunbar and Walter Kennedy, before the Court of James IV of Scotland.\n\nThere are clues in the poem that suggest some of the features that the show must have contained. Each of the combatants had a \"commissar\", both of whom are named in the work and sometimes directly addressed by the performers. These are (respectively) Sir John the Ross for Dunbar and Quentin Shaw for Kennedy, both of whom were actual persons. Shaw (certainly) and Ross (probably) were also poets, and it seems possible that they played some material part in the performance.\n\nRoss, Shaw, and Kennedy are all three named as a group in the closing stanzas of Dunbar's \"Lament for the Makaris\".\n\nIn the poem as it survives, there are two exchanges. Dunbar opens with a three-stanza address to his commissar which pours lofty scorn on the poetic pretensions of Kennedy and his commissar, describing what must happen if their self-promotion should move him to reluctantly unleash his own far superior powers; which boast Kennedy answers, also in three stanzas, with a direct, highly personalised address to Dunbar, knocking his claims down to size and commanding him to bide his wheesht. Needless to say, Dunbar does not obey the injunction and a sustained poetic attack follows (25 stanzas) which Kennedy matches with a longer and equally sustained reply thirteen stanzas longer again (38).\n\nIn keeping with the genre there is a great show of outrageous verbal dexterity and invention by both combatants. Each makar eventually closes their performance with a showy verbal climax involving doubling and tripling of rhymes and much-intensified alliteration.\n\nThe content of the insults involves a wide range of strategies in mock character assassination, from the low scatological to the high political. Many accusations involve the capital crimes of theft, treason, and heresy, which, at moments (especially if the context was the royal court), add a potentially dangerous sense of political \"frisson\" (Kennedy goes so far as to describe the Dunbar coat of arms as being a noose with \"Hang Dunbar\" written underneath). Both combatants took great relish describing the terrible punishments that would be meted out upon their opponent and the pictures evoked imply the proximity of instruments of execution in the medieval landscape as bleak as that in many images of the time in art.\n\nMost of the insults thrown by Dunbar are returned or matched in kind by Kennedy, which gives the poem a balance in overall structure. The insults are graphic and personal, and were not necessarily arbitrary. Dunbar characterises Kennedy as speaking a barbarous Highland dialect, as being physically hideous and withered like a sort of living memento mori, as being poor and hungry, and of having intercourse with mares. Kennedy, by contrast, suggests that Dunbar was descended from Beelzebub, is a dwarf, and has no control of his bowel movements (to the point of almost sinking a ship in which he is travelling). Both cast doubt on the other's poetic skill; Kennedy states that while he ascends Mount Parnassus to drink of the insiprational waters of the Castalian Spring, Dunbar goes \"in Marche or Februere\" to a farm pond and drinks the frogspawn. The satire may perhaps give us caricature impressions of the physical appearance and moral vulnerabilities of the two men, even if no actual portraits of either man are known to have survived.\n\nAnthologies often print Dunbar's contribution alone, but the contest was evenly matched; Dunbar may seem stronger on \"fireworks\", but Kennedy employs greater tonal subtlety.\n\nGeorge Bannatyne, in his manuscript copy, added the postscript \"Iuge ye now heir quha gat the war\".\n\nThough Dunbar uses the standard eight-line ballade stanza for his major attack, his opening stanzas use the variant rhyme scheme ABABBCCB, and it is this variant that Kennedy employs throughout in both of his replies. The lines are pentameter.\n\nKennedy and Dunbar's Flyting seems to have been a popular and influential poem and was almost a \"de rigueur\" inclusion in Scottish anthologies of verse for the next two centuries. It was one of the earliest works to be printed by Chepman and Myllar after they were granted the King's licence to operate as printers in Edinburgh (1507). The bardic bout seems to have inspired a legacy of similar contests, most famous of which are the Flyting between Lyndsay and King James V (c. 1536), and the Flyting of Montgomerie and Polwarth (c. 1598).\n\nCommentators of the 19th and 20th centuries tended to be less favourable towards the poem. The makar and critic Tom Scott regarded it as a crude and offensive work unworthy of critical attention.\n\n"}

The ship travels around the world to nations such as Italy, France, Greece, India, Sweden and the United Kingdom where the characters experience different cultures, adventures, and situations.\n\nThe series' pilot aired in the UK on September 19, 2008, and in U.S. markets on September 26, 2008. The series premiere on the Disney Channel in the U.S. drew 5.7 million viewers, and it became the most watched series premiere in Canada on the Family Channel.

The series is also 2009's top rated scripted series in the children and tween demographic (6–14).\n\nThe series has been broadcast in more than 30 countries worldwide, and was shot at Hollywood Center Studios in Los Angeles (as was the original series). The series was taped in front of a live studio audience, though a laugh track is used for some scenes. The series is the second spin-off of a Disney Channel series (after the short-lived \"That's So Raven\" spinoff \"Cory in the House\"); as well as the last Disney Channel series to debut broadcasting exclusively in standard definition, and the first of three Disney Channel shows to transition from standard definition to high definition, which occurred on August 7, 2009 with the season 2 premiere, \"The Spy Who Shoved Me,\" and the third multi-camera comedy (after \"Sonny with a Chance\" and \"Jonas\") to utilize a filmized appearance instead of the Filmlook appearance that was used in the first season.\n\nOn March 25, 2011, a film based on \"The Suite Life on Deck\" and its parent series titled \"The Suite Life Movie\" aired on the Disney Channel. The series' forty-minute finale episode, \"Graduation on Deck\", aired on Disney Channel on May 6, 2011, officially ending the series.\n\n\n\n\nOn February 4, 2008, it was announced that the Disney Channel was developing a new contemporary sequel to the Disney channel sitcom \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\". The announcement was made by Gary Marsh, the President of the Disney Channel. He stated, \"Our audience has shown us that after 88 episodes, 'The Suite Life of Zack & Cody' remains one of their favorite sitcoms ever, we decided to find a new way for Zack, Cody, London, and Mr. Moseby to live 'The Suite Life' in a whole new setting – this time aboard a luxury cruise liner.\" The series original creator, Danny Kallis was announced to be involved with the project. The elements from the original series remain the same though the setting is completely different.\n\nIn December 2008, it was reported that the Disney Channel had renewed the series for a thirteen episode second season. On May 11, 2009, Disney issued a press release stating that the second season had been extended to include a larger number of episodes than the original thirteen. Gary Marsh, the president of Disney Channels Worldwide said: \"With this second-season extension, the cast of ‘The Suite Life’ makes Disney Channel history by becoming the longest running continuous characters on our air – 138 half-hour episodes. We are thrilled for them, and for the brilliant, inspired production team that made this extraordinary run possible.\"\n\nAs of 2011, \"The Suite Life\" series holds the record (162 episodes) for having the longest running continuous characters on air and the most canon episodes for any Disney Channel series.\n\nAccording to show creators and producers, the choice of setting was made to appeal to an international audience with different ports-of-call, such as India, Greece, Italy, Morocco, the United Kingdom and Thailand. An on-board theater serves as an \"organic\" set-up for musical numbers. Most of the action in the series occurs on board the SS \"Tipton\". However, the ship travels to a variety of places around the world which are often unfamiliar places to both Zack and Cody Martin.\n\nThe SS \"Tipton\" is a cruise ship belonging to London Tipton's father. The ship had its first canon appearance in \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\" episode \"Let Us Entertain You\". Unlike most cruise ships it also includes a school, Seven Seas High School, which is a common setting on the ship, as are the Sky Deck, the lobby, the corridors outside the students' cabins and the cabins themselves. In the third season, the Aqua Lounge, a newly refurbished space on the ship, was shown, and it replaced the Sky Deck as the main hangout (although the Sky Deck is still commonly shown). There are also various areas on the SS \"Tipton\" that are mentioned, but never seen, including several decks and the ship's putt-putt golf course, where the captain spends most of his time. In the crossover episode of \"Wizards of Waverly Place\", \"Cast-Away (To Another Show),\" Mr. Moseby reveals that the ship itself weighs 87,000 tons. After the events in \"Graduation on Deck\" the SS \"Tipton\" was sold and later dismantled. Mr Moseby mentioned in the season 1 episode \"Cruisin' for a Bruisin'\", that the ship was not the first ship with the SS \"Tipton\" name (indicating that the Tipton cruiseline had been in service long before the events of the first series). Mr Tipton commissioned a scale model \"replica-in-a-bottle\" of the first SS \"Tipton\" as a gift for Captain Lansferd.\n\n\nThe show's theme song, \"Livin' the Suite Life,\" was written by John Adair and Steve Hampton (who also wrote the themes for fellow Disney Channel series \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\", \"Phil of the Future\", and \"Wizards of Waverly Place\", as well as the theme for the ABC Kids series \"\"), with music composed by Gary Scott (who also composed the music cues to signal scene changes and promo breaks, some of which are styled similarly to the theme), and is performed by British singer Steve Rushton (who is only credited for performing the theme in the second season).\n\nThe series was one of only 4 of Disney Channel shows still running in 2011 whose theme song is not performed by a star of the series (\"Phineas and Ferb,\" \"Fish Hooks\" and \"Shake It Up \" are the others).\n\nNote: The show's first ever air date was in the United Kingdom on September 19, 2008.\n\nThe episode \"Double-Crossed\" is the second part of a three-way crossover that begins on \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" and concludes on \"Hannah Montana\". Cody promises to get tickets for himself and Bailey to a concert in Hawaii featuring Hannah Montana, who has boarded the SS \"Tipton\". In the meantime, the Russo siblings enjoy a cruise of their own until Alex pulls a prank that causes Justin to turn blue.\n\nOn September 20, 2010, Disney Channel announced that production had begun for a Disney Channel Original Movie based on \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\" and \"The Suite Life on Deck\".\n\n\"The Suite Life Movie\" premiered on the Disney Channel in the United States and Canada on March 25, 2011.\n\nIn 2013, during an interview with \"Gawker\", Dylan Sprouse revealed he and his brother had pitched an idea to the Disney Channel about continuing the \"Suite Life\" series. The show would see Zack and Cody return to the Tipton Hotel in Boston to live with their mother, and would become mentors to a boy who lived with his father at the hotel. Disney rejected the idea initially, but contacted the twins a year later with an edited concept that retained the boy and his father storyline, but Zack and Cody would move to a Miami hotel instead, Selena Gomez would also star and the twins would not get producer credits like they had requested. The Sprouses rejected the concept, leaving the project abandoned.\n\n\"The Suite Life on Deck\" premiered in Australia and New Zealand October 6, 2008. It is broadcast on Disney Channel and on NZ MediaWorks TV3 and FOUR.\n\nThe Canadian Family Channel debuted the series October 13, 2008. VRAK.TV broadcast the series as \"La vie de croisière de Zack et Cody\" (\"The Cruise Life of Zack and Cody\") beginning August 27, 2009. The series also aired on Disney XD (Canada) beginning June 1, 2011.\n\nIn Ireland, the series debuted on Disney XD September 4, 2010.\n\nDisney Channel broadcast the series in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland February 6, 2009, with an advance airing September 19, 2008. The series also aired on Disney XD beginning July 16, 2012.\n\n\"The Suite Life on Deck\" premiered in the United States September 26, 2008 on Disney Channel. Disney XD began broadcasting the series February 13, 2009.\n\nAn activity book based on the series was released on July 13, 2009. The book is called \"The Suite Life on Deck Sink or Swim Sticker Activity Book\". A photo album based on the series was also released, and it includes several posters, colored images from the series, captions and activities for the reader. In August 2009, two new books titled \"Suite Life on Deck: A Day in the Life\" and \"Suite Life on Deck Party Planner\" were released by Walt Disney.\n\nThe show's pilot premiered on the Disney Channel in the U.S. on September 26, 2008, and gathered 5.7 million viewers on the night of its premiere. The series premiere in Canada was also the most watched series premiere on Family channel. In December 2008, Business Wire reported the show was 2008's #1 top scripted television series for children between the ages 6 to 11 and pre-teenagers between the ages 9 to 14, beating the veteran series \"Hannah Montana\" and \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" in the ratings. The show was in the #1 spot for the top rated children's television series for many months. The show has been one of the top 4 live-action television series for many months. Since then, \"The Suite Life on Deck\" held a commanding lead in the time slot (Friday 8:00 p.m.), ranking as TV's #1 program among the key children demographics, virtually doubling Nickelodeon among children between the age of 9–14, and defeating it by a 6% among children between the age of 6–11. In addition, the series is #1 in total viewers on all cable, outperforming #2 rank (Fox News and Nickelodeon) by 800,000 more viewers.\n\nAs of August 2009, the highest rated episode of \"The Suite Life on Deck\" was \"Double-Crossed,\" the second part of \"Wizards On Deck with Hannah Montana\", a trilogy of crossover episodes featuring guest stars from \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" and \"Hannah Montana\" which premiered on July 17, 2009 on Disney Channel. The special was viewed by more than 10.6 million viewers, program of the night across both cable and broadcast television, and ranks as one of the highest-rated episodes for a Disney Channel original series. This was the first episode that Cody and Bailey go out on a date.\n\nIn early October 2009, the series one-hour special episode \"Lost at Sea\" became the most watched episode of the series, with 7.6 million total viewers, including 3.2 million in the Kids 6–11 demographic, and 2.8 million in the Tweens 9–13 demographic. The episode delivered Disney Channel’s best numbers in the hour with regular programming in the net's history. In 2009, the series was the most watched scripted series in the children and tween demographic (6–14), outpacing \"Hannah Montana\" and several other teenage shows. The series second season's ratings grew 25% higher than the show's season one ratings, the second season has averaged approximately 5.1 million viewers.\n\nBefore the series officially made its debut on air, the first episode entitled \"The Suite Life Sets Sail\" was made available as a free download on iTunes. All series have since been made available.\n\n"}
{"id": "10179334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10179334", "title": "Theatre of the Oppressed", "text": "Theatre of the Oppressed\n\nThe Theatre of the Oppressed (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first elaborated in the 1970s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal was influenced by the work of the educator and theorist Paulo Freire. Boal's techniques use theatre as means of promoting social and political change in alignment originally with radical left politics and later with center left ideology. In the Theatre of the Oppressed, the audience becomes active, such that as \"spect-actors\" they explore, show, analyse and transform the reality in which they are living.\nThe Theatre of the Oppressed, a term coined by Augusto Boal, is a series of theatrical analyses and critiques developed in the 1950s. Boal was an avid supporter of utilizing interactive techniques, especially in the context of theatre. Many of his ideas are considered as \"a new media perspective\", despite the relatively early birth of these ideas. Since then, these ideas have been developed more, giving them meaning in a modern-day context. The creation of the Theatre of the Oppressed is largely based on the idea of dialogue and interaction between audience and performer. Moreover, these ideas have served as a framework for the development and evolution of stronger ideas.\n\nMuch of Augusto Boal's theatrical process requires a neutral party to be at the centre of proceedings. This individual is usually called the \"facilitator\". In Boal's literature this role is referred to as the \"joker\", in reference to the neutrality of the Joker card in a deck of playing cards.\n\nThis person takes responsibility for the logistics of the process and ensures a fair proceeding, but must never comment upon or intervene in the content of the performance, as that is the province of the \"spect-actors\". Fairness in this context means making sure that the problem story, which by its nature involves a situation of oppression that must be overcome, is not solved—that is, that the participants (the \"\") focus on solving the problem in as realistic and plausible a way as possible, even though it is being played out in a fictional theatrical piece. The result should be something like group \"brainstorming\" about social problems within the community.\n\nThis is a term created by Augusto Boal to describe those engaged in Forum theatre. It refers to the dual role of those involved in the process as both spectator and actor, as they both observe and create dramatic meaning and action in any performance.\n\nEqually, the term \"spect-actor\" can be attributed to the participants in invisible theatre (who are unaware that they are part of a theatrical production, but nevertheless contribute to the discussion) and image theatre (who, upon viewing the image created, may alter it to reflect their own ideas).\n\nBoal emphasizes the critical need to prevent the isolation of the audience. The term \"spectator\" brands the participants as less than human; hence, it's necessary to humanize them, to restore to them their capacity for action in all its fullness. They must also be a subject, an actor on equal plane with those accepted as actors, who in turn must also be spectators. This will eliminate any notions of the ruling class and the theatre solely portraying their ideals while the audience members are the passive victims of those images. This way the spectators no longer delegate power to the characters either to think or act in their place. They free themselves; they think and act for themselves. Boal supports the idea that theatre is not revolutionary in itself but is rehearsal of revolution. (Wardrip-Fruin, 352)\n\nDuring the development of Theatre of the Oppressed, Boal worked with many populations and tried many techniques. These techniques eventually coalesced into different theatrical styles, each using a different process to achieve a different result. Boal often organized these theatrical systems as a tree, with images, sounds and words as the roots, games, Image Theatre and Forum Theatre ascending up the trunk, and then other techniques represented as limbs stemming from these. As more T.O. systems evolved, Boal and others have made slight modifications to which techniques appear on various limbs, but the Tree of Theatre of the Oppressed has mostly remained consistent:\n\nImage theatre is a performance technique in which one person, acting as a sculptor, moulds one or more people acting as statues, using only touch and resisting the use of words or mirror-image modelling. Boal claims this form of theatre to be one of the most stimulating because of its ease of enactment and its remarkable capacity of portraying thought in a concrete form due to the absence of language idiom. Each word has a denotation common for all as well as a connotation that is unique for each individual. Each will have his own interpretation of \"revolution\", and to demonstrate such idea provides a clearer understanding of their intention in definition when shown rather than told. (Wardrip-Fruin, 344). For instance, one can \"embrace\" another in many ways (in a tight, harassing manner or a loose soft manner), however the word has the same definition of clasping another person in the arms.\n\nWhile practicing in South America earlier in his career, Boal would apply 'simultaneous dramaturgy'. In this process, the actors or audience members could stop a performance, often a short scene in which a character was being oppressed in some way (for example, a typically chauvinist man mistreating a woman or a factory owner mistreating an employee). In early forms of 'simultaneous dramaturgy', the audience could propose any solution, by calling out suggestions to the actors who would improvise the changes on stage. This was an attempt to undo the traditional audience/actor partition and bring audience members into the performance, to have an input into the dramatic action they were watching.\n\nForum Theatre was essentially born from 'simultaneous dramaturgy.' The concept of the 'spect-actor' became a dominant force within and shaped Boal's theater work, gradually helping it shift into what he called Forum Theatre (due to the acting's taking on the character of a public discussion or series of proposals, only in dramatic format). The audience were now encouraged to not only imagine change but to actually practise that change, by coming on stage as 'spect-actors' to replace the protagonist and act out an intervention to \"break the oppression.\" Through this process, the participant is also able to realize and experience the challenges of achieving the improvements he/she suggested (Wardrip-Fruin, 344). The actors who welcome the spectactor volunteering onto the stage play against the spectactor's attempts to intervene and change the story, offering a strong resistance so that the difficulties in making any change are also acknowledged.\nThus, Boal's current manifestation of Forum theatre is as follows: the actors (either professional actors or non professionals drawn from oppressed communities) perform a play with a scripted core, in which an oppression relevant to the audience is played out. After reaching the scripted conclusion, in which the oppressed character(s) fail to overturn their oppression, the actors begin the production again, although often in a condensed form. At any point during this \"second\" performance, any spect-actor may call out \"stop!\" and take the place of the actor portraying the \"oppressed\" individual (this actor stays on stage but to the side, giving suggestions to the spect-actor who has replaced him/her).\n\nIf and when the oppression has been overthrown by the spect-actors, the production changes again: the spect-actors now have the opportunity to replace the \"oppressors\", and find new ways of challenging the oppressed character. In this way a more realistic depiction of the oppression can be made by the audience, who are often victims of the oppression. The whole process is designed to be dialectic, coming to a conclusion through the consideration of opposing arguments, rather than didactic, in which the moral argument is one-sided and pushed from the actors with no chance of reply or counter-argument.\n\nBoal clarifies that this practice is not intended to show the correct path, but rather to discover all possible paths which may be further examined. The theatre itself is not revolutionary; but it offers a chance to rehearse for revolution. The spectators learn much from the enactment even though the acting is fiction, because the fiction simulates real-life situations, problems, and solutions. It stimulates the practice of resistance to oppression in reality, and offers a \"safe space\" for practicing making change. When faced in reality with a similar situation they've rehearsed in theatre, participants who have experienced Forum Theatre ideally will desire to be proactive, and will have the courage to break oppressive situations in real life, since they feel much more prepared and confident in resolving the conflict. Another way of thinking about it is that rehearsing the actions helps spectactors to develop their own courage and makes them desire action for change in real life. The practice of this form creates an uneasy sense of incompleteness that seeks fulfillment through real action. (Wardrip-Fruin, 346) \n\nInvisible theatre is a form of theatrical performance that is enacted in a place where people would not normally expect to see one—for example in the street or in a shopping centre. The performers attempt to disguise the fact that it is a performance from those who observe and who may choose to participate in it, encouraging the spectators (or rather, unknowing spect-actors) to view it as a real event. The Brazilian theater practitioner Augusto Boal & Panagiotis Assimakopoulos developed the form during Boal's time in Argentina in the 1970s as part of his Theater of the Oppressed work, which focused on oppression and social issues.\n\nA system of techniques devised to give the audience a way to transform daily news articles or any non-dramatic pieces to theatrical scene. The strategies are as follows (Wardrip-Fruin, 346):\n\n\nRainbow of Desire is a technique and also a family of techniques explained by Boal in his book of the same name. Rainbow techniques stem from Image theatre and tend to focus on forms of internalized oppression played out by a protagonist in relation to an antagonist. While in his earlier work Boal eschewed the use of Theatre of the Oppressed as \"drama therapy\", he later began to espouse these more introspective techniques as a form of \"theatre and therapy.\"\n\nWhen Boal was a \"Vereador\" (city councilman) in Rio de Janeiro, he created a new form of theatre called \"legislative theatre\" to give his voters the opportunity to voice their opinions. The objective is to open up a dialogue between citizens and institutional entities so that there is a flow of power between both groups. Boal calls this type of legislative process a \"transitive democracy,\" which lies in between direct democracy (practiced in ancient Greece) and delegate democracy. It is similar to forum theatre; however, the subject of the production is based on a proposed law to be passed. Spect-actors may take the stage and express their opinions, thereby helping with the creation of new laws. Some 13 laws were created through legislative theatre during Boal's time in government. The technique has since been used overseas in countries including Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nA story is told by one of the participants and immediately the actors improvise it. Afterward each character is broken down into their social roles and the participants are asked to choose a physical object to symbolize each role. For instance for one community the symbol for the head of the family may be a piggy bank, since that individual is the one who controls the finances (power). Having analyzed the characters, a fresh attempt to tell the story is made, however this time removing some of the symbols from each character, and consequently some social roles as well. For example, the story would be perceived differently if the robber had the police uniform and the hostage possessed a revolver. Through this method, the participants will realize that human actions are not the exclusive and primitive result of human psychology; the individual speaks of their class as well. (Wardrip-Fruin, 351)\n\nBoal explains that the technique of breaking repression involves asking the participant to remember a particular moment when he or she felt especially repressed, accepted it, and submitted to act in a manner contrary to his or her own desires. It is necessary, he explains, that the choice is a particular incident rather than a general sense of oppression. The participant describes that incident, which is then reconstructed and re-enacted with other participants of his choosing. This performance is repeated, except that this time the repressed is asked to fight to impose his or her will while the others involved are invited to maintain the repression.\n\nThe conflict that results helps to measure the possibility one has to resist in situations where one fails to do so, as well as to measure the true strength of the enemy. Having rehearsed a resistance to oppression prepares the individual to resist effectively in similar situations that may be encountered in the future.(Wardrip-Fruin,349)\n\nBoal states that the process to be realized in doing this type of theater is the one that ascends from the phenomenon toward the law; from the phenomena presented in the plot toward the social laws that govern those phenomena.(Wardrip-Fruin,349)\n\nPhoto-romance is a romantic narrative illustrated with sequential photographs in the style of a comic strip, usually published in magazines and such. The technique involves introducing to the participants the general plot without revealing the source of the photo-romance. Then, the participants are asked to act out the story, which is then compared to the actual story as described in the source. The differences are discussed thereafter.\n\nA particular story interpreted and acted out may be a predictable, pathetic one, however at the same time this result serves as a magnificent example of ideological insight. Boal argues that if they first act out the story themselves then afterwords read the original version, the participants will no longer assume a passive, expectant attitude, but instead a critical, comparative one. They will also be prepared to detect the poison infiltrating the pages of those photo-stories, or the comics and other forms of cultural and ideological domination. This technique is also useful to analyze television programs, a dominant source of poison directed against the people. (Wardrip-Fruin, 349)\n\nThis technique attempts to reveal the ideological superstructure of a society in the form of its rituals. \"Rituals\" in this sense describes the patterns of human relationships and the masks of behaviour that those patterns impose on the participants according to the roles that they play in society. For example: a man goes to a priest to confess his sins; despite the individual identities of the man and priest (i.e. the priest and the parishioner are landlords, the priest is a landlord and the parishioner is a peasant, etc.) the pattern of behavior will remain the same as other examples of this interaction. This will cause different scenarios to play out even though the confession is the same. Boal argues that this is an extraordinarily rich technique that has many variants: for example, the same ritual may be explored by its participants exchanging masks or it may be enacted by people from different social classes.\n\nInspired by Augusto Boal, this Organisation links other Theatre of the Oppressed groups to one another. The idea is that others will help groups organize themselves and create new centers for Theatres of the Oppressed. There are links to other organisations involved with this projects so anyone can contact anyone else involved. This online Organisation allows others to share information about the Theatre of the Oppressed.\n\nThe largest single organisation in the Theatre of the Oppressed network is Jana Sanskriti. Set up by Sanjoy Ganguly in the Sunderbans, a rural area outside Calcutta in the Bay of Bengal, Jana Sanskriti has a membership of over 40,000, 30 theatre teams, and an impressive record of art and activism which has resulted in major improvements in health, infrastructure, welfare benefits, education and social awareness through the region.\nBoal's ideas have been widely accepted and used by theatre groups in Mozambique after the end of the civil war in 1992 to explain the need for reconciliation and to discuss topics such as avoiding landmines, voting in the first democratic elections and the rights of peasants under the new land law.\nGrupo de Teatro dos Oprimidos - Maputo was founded in 2001 after Alvim Cossa spent six months studying theater methodology in Rio de Janeiro by a grant from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. It has presented plays such as \"O meu marido esta a negar\" (My Husband is in Denial), documented as a film by Rogério Manjate, which discusses HIV/AIDS avoidance and treatment. This play is presented in public places - markets, schools and businesses - and the public is invited to attend and present their own solutions to the unequal power relations shown in the play. The result is more effective than a lecture in Portuguese or distribution of written material to a largely illiterate population.\n\nCentre for Community Dialogue and Change (CCDC) is an organisation based in Bengaluru, India which is dedicated to the promotion of Theatre of the Oppressed chiefly in education as well as medical humanities. CCDC has conducted many workshops among diverse population in India as well as abroad.\n\nInfinite Ability, the disability special-interest-group within the Medical Humanities Group of University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS), Delhi, India and CCDC organised the first ever Theatre of the Oppressed workshop for medical students in Delhi in 2011. Both of these groups are promoting theatre of the oppressed in South Asia.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "639072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=639072", "title": "Theatrical property", "text": "Theatrical property\n\nA prop, formally known as (theatrical) property, is an object used on stage or on screen by actors during a performance or screen production. In practical terms, a prop is considered to be anything movable or portable on a stage or a set, distinct from the actors, scenery, costumes, and electrical equipment. Consumable food items appearing in the production are also considered props.\n\nThe earliest known use of the term \"properties\" in English to refer to stage accessories is in the 1425 CE morality play, \"The Castle of Perseverance\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" finds the first usage of \"props\" in 1841, while the singular form of \"prop\" appeared in 1911.\nDuring the Renaissance in Europe, small acting troupes functioned as cooperatives, pooling resources and dividing any income. Many performers provided their own costumes, but special items—stage weapons, furniture or other hand-held devices—were considered \"company property\"; hence the term \"property.\" Some experts however seem to think that the term comes from the idea that stage or screen objects \"belong\" to whoever uses them on stage.\n\nThere is no difference between props in different media, such as theatre, film, or television. Bland Wade, a properties director, says, \"A coffee cup onstage is a coffee cup on television, is a coffee cup on the big screen.\" He adds, \"There are definitely different responsibilities and different vocabulary.\"\n\nThe term \"theatrical property\" originated to describe an object used in a stage play and similar entertainments to further the action. Technically, a prop is any object that gives the scenery, actors, or performance space specific period, place, or character. The term comes from live-performance practice, especially theatrical methods, but its modern use extends beyond the traditional plays and musical, circus, novelty, comedy, and even public-speaking performances, to film, television, and electronic media.\n\nProps in a production originate from off stage unless they have been preset on the stage before the production begins. Props are stored on a prop table backstage near the actor's entrance during production then generally locked in a storage area between performances. The person in charge of handling the props is generally called the \"props master\". Other positions also include coordinators, production assistants and interns as may be needed for a specific project.\n\nThe term has readily transferred to television, motion picture and video game production, where they are commonly referred to by the phrase movie prop, film prop or simply prop. In recent years, the increasing popularity of movie memorabilia (a broader term that also includes costumes) has added new meaning to the term \"prop\", broadening its existence to include a valuable after-life as a prized collector's item. Typically not available until after a film's premiere, movie props appearing on-screen are called \"screen-used\", and can fetch thousands of dollars in online auctions and charity benefits.\n\nMany props are ordinary objects. However, a prop must \"read well\" from the house or on-screen, meaning it must look real to the audience. Many real objects are poorly adapted to the task of looking like themselves to an audience, due to their size, durability, or color under bright lights, so some props are specially designed to look more like the actual item than the real object would look. In some cases, a prop is designed to behave differently from how the real object would, often for the sake of safety.\n\nExamples of special props are:\n\n"}
{"id": "9110645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9110645", "title": "Thomas &amp; Friends merchandise", "text": "Thomas &amp; Friends merchandise\n\n\"Thomas & Friends\" merchandise has been produced to capitalize on the success of the television series \"Thomas & Friends\" (formerly \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\"). Whilst merchandise was produced alongside due to the popularity of the first of The Railway Series books by the Rev. W. Awdry since 1945, and the original broadcast of the television series in 1984 in the United Kingdom, large numbers of manufacturers have sought to produce \"Thomas\"-branded items after the television series was broadcast in America and Japan.\n\nThe most popular and wide-ranging items of merchandise are the models of the characters, which have been produced in many different ranges, some including accompanying railway systems. The Rev. W. Awdry created the original toy model of Thomas the Tank Engine, which inspired the character, soon after the first book of stories was complete. In 1927, while still at school, he built Annie, and in 1948, he built Clarabel. Other popular products include videos, books and magazines, and computer games. 'Thomas' merchandise has also included such diverse items as: audiobooks, annuals, colouring and activity books, jigsaws, board games, stationery, clothing, cutlery, household items such as curtains, duvet covers and lampshades, and soft drinks and spaghetti shapes.\n\nThomas & Friends ranked number one in the preschool toys category in the U.S. and made the top 10 for the entire U.S. toy industry in 2010. In January 2011, Thomas & Friends ranked as the number-one preschool toy property in the U.K. for the 11th year in a row. Thomas is also a top-selling toy property in Australia, Germany, Japan and Korea. While the total traditional toy industry in the United States increased 1.9 per cent in 2010, overall Thomas & Friends toy sales increased over 47.1 per cent. \n\nIn 2016 a version of the Nabi SE Android tablet themed after the series received FCC certification and was to be released alongside the American Girl, Barbie and Hot Wheels tablets, but as of 2018 no mention of such a device was made on Nabi or the series' official website. In 2015 Mattel made Thomas and Friends Minis to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Thomas. In 2016, the brand was so popular it was around for longer.\n\nThe first commercial models released alongside The Railway Series, in 1957, were 'Pre-cut Model Engine Books'. These were full-colour printed cardboard kits whose pieces could be pressed out, folded and glued together to make fairly realistic models. They were produced through the 1960s. Four titles were published:\nThe advertisements \non the back of the Railway Series books promised, \"Other models are being prepared\", although, even if ever prepared, they were never published.\n\nA 12-page \"Thomas the Tank Engine Press-out Model Book\" () by the Rev. W. Awdry and Ken Stott, was released in September 1987.\n\nIn 1994, a new range of press-out models was released, this time drawn by Ken Stott instead of C. Reginald Dalby. Each book came with accessories, track and a station. The range comprised the following characters: Thomas, Percy, James, Toby, Annie, Clarabel, Bertie the Bus, Harold the Helicopter.\n\nIn 1967, Meccano Ltd released a train set featuring a clockwork model of Percy the Small Engine with some trucks — a yellow open wagon and a red closed van — and a circle of blue track. The model of Percy was a fair likeness of the pictures in the books and was about the size of an O gauge engine. The box featured special artwork by Peter Edwards and included the title, \"Percy the Small Engine, brought to life by Meccano\".\n\nThe plastic track was advertised as: \"Gauge O track that clicks together and includes Brake Rail for automatic braking. Rails specially designed to make it easy to put train on the track.\" In practice, although it was advertised as 'Gauge O', this only indicated the size of the model, since the track design was not compatible with anything else (the models were effectively 'flangeless').\n\nAdverts for the set, which showed the model train 'emerging' from the book \"Percy the Small Engine\", appeared in \"Meccano Magazine\" and on the back of the dust-covers for several of The Railway Series books in print at the time.\n\nThe train set was only produced in 1967, and is now extremely rare. It is notable as the last O Gauge train to be made at Meccano's famous Binns Road factory in Liverpool, where the Hornby tinplate trains were made.\n\nPhotographs of the set and the adverts may be found here and a close-up of Percy may be found here.\n\nErtl was the first company to manufacture Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends characters and sets from 1985 in the UK and from 1989 in the US. Production ceased for the US market in 2001, and for the UK market in 2004 after RC2 Corporation acquired Ertl and discontinued the ranges to avoid conflict with the then existing Thomas license held by Learning Curve Brands, which produced the similar Take Along Thomas and Friends system.\n\nThe most notable of the Ertl Company's Thomas ranges was a line of die-cast models and playsets. The range was very popular in the UK, and the nature of the subject matter encouraged collecting.\n\nThomas, Henry, and James were the first models to be released. The original Thomas featured a decal sticker sheet which allowed him to have different expressions. Percy, Toby, Annie and Clarabel, and Bertie followed in late 1985, with updated versions of Thomas, Henry, and James with red buffer beams to replace the older white ones. Edward and Gordon came out in 1988. In 1990, characters were updated with fixed plastic faces as the \"sticker-face\" models were prone to losing their faces. New vehicles were produced on a near-yearly basis, such as recently introduced characters to tie-in with their TV series appearance, as well as characters who had only appeared in The Railway Series books. In later years, special vehicles were created, such as metallic variants of engines, a Gold Thomas to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of The Railway Series, and a Millennium Silver Thomas in 2000.\n\nThe vehicles first used pin hook couplings to couple up and create trains. Locomotives had a moulded coupling 'eye' at each end, while rolling stock had one 'hook' coupling and one 'eye' coupling on the other end. In 2002, the vehicles were updated to use U-hook couplings, with less 'give', but they were more prone to breakage. The majority of locomotive models and some road vehicles had a diecast metal body with a moulded plastic chassis and plastic wheels. The bodies were fully painted and lined. They were free-wheeling although the chassis was rigid (locomotives were not fitted with separate bogies), and a steam locomotive's tender was part of the same moulding as its body. Models of coaches and trucks were assembled from self-coloured plastic mouldings, with some surface detail (such as coach sides) being applied using self-adhesive labels.\n\nSets and destinations were produced for the vehicles. The original playsets composed of playmats with illustrations of scenery and rails and moulded destinations. Later sets consisted of a grey connectable track system, with additional add-on destinations and pieces of track included with engines. The track system was updated in 2002 with detailed rail stickers and a green border.\n\nMiniatures was a Thomas line released in 1991. It featured main characters with sticker faces which were previously used in the die-cast range. Included with the character was a connectable block base in the form of a destination, such as a turntable, windmill, level crossing, or viaduct, made from plastic components to insert into the base, and an indented track section which requires adhesive stickers to be placed. The destinations can be connected to form a playset. Characters were also sold individually, and in multi-packs of three. The range was discontinued in 1992. The engines were later re-released as Keyrings.\n\nIn 2004, the line was re-released as Thomas Mini World. The characters were updated with moulded faces, and the bases were updated to a style similar to LEGO where the track pieces and buildings can be placed in different positions.\n\nGold Rail Series was a Thomas line released in 1993. The products were from the Thomas Engine Collection Series made in Japan by Bandai. The vehicles have magnetic couplings which can connect to other vehicles using a connected switch. The playsets have a moulded section for track with self-adhesive labels for detail, have ramps on the edges for the engines to exit the destination, and feature detailed trackside accessories.\n\nLarge Motorized versions of Thomas and Percy were released in 1985. These used the same designs as the die-cast versions, and can move when pulled back. A Remote Control Thomas and a Personalized Money Box was also released in 1985, similar in design to the Motorized version.\n\nA range called Pull Back and Go! featuring pullback versions of Thomas, Percy, Toby, and Bertie were released under Shining Time Station. A large wind-up Sir Topham Hatt was also produced, and later a Wind Up series with Thomas, Percy, James, Henry, Bill, Ben, and Bertie.\n\nSets containing eight collector cards of vehicles were made from 1996 to 1999, similar to the existing cards on the packaging design from those corresponding years which could be cut out.\n\nMerit produced several push-along toys to tie-in with the TV series. These included a sit-on Thomas built for toddlers which had a black handle on the rear which enabled it to be pushed along by the parent, large push along versions using hook couplings of Thomas, Annie, and Clarabel and Percy with Troublesome Trucks, a small push along version of Thomas, Annie, and Clarabel using stronger pivot couplings, a Thomas toy with shaped holes and a set of blocks which could be inserted into the correct holes on the Thomas, and some larger scale battery-operated toys.\n\nIn 1985, Hornby Railways produced a series of 00 gauge model engines, track, accessories, and sets, based on Thomas and Friends, designed to be compatible with other Hornby trains, thus allowing an easy migration to more prototypical modelling. The range mainly utilised modified versions of existing Hornby engines, rolling stock and lineside accessories. Over the following years, the range expanded to include some of the main characters and rolling stock as well as train sets. During the 1990s, very few new products were made, and some vehicles discontinued. Some characters were gradually reintroduced towards the end of the decade, and more new items including major and minor characters were released from 2000. New sets were also made using a themed radio control operating system and a Trak-Mat system that sets in Hornby's existing lines used, were customers are encouraged to buy additional track packs, scenery packs, and other scenic materials to create the full printed layout. In 2005, the range revamped due to the 60th Anniversary of The Railway Series and two characters only seen in the book series were introduced, Flying Scotsman and Bear. Several pieces of rolling stock, most seen in Season 8 were also introduced, including a circus series with a total of twelve wagons, as well as three tents and stalls. The sets were redesigned using the regular analogue controllers, and a range of resin buildings seen in the television series designed for adult collectors were introduced. New items were introduced during the next three years to tie in with recent seasons of the television series and the special, The Great Discovery. In 2008 and 2009, new sets were made with the updated Midi-Mat system, replacing the Trak-Mat. From 2010, more items were again discontinuing due to their poor sales. The range was discontinued in 2014, but was relaunched in December 2015, albeit with only Thomas, Edward, Henry, Gordon, James, and Percy as locos, and limited rolling stock consisting of Troublesome Trucks, Annie and Clarabel, freight wagons, and James and Gordon's coaches. The other parts of the range were not reintroduced due to declining sales.\n\nThe models are designed for somewhat older children than most Thomas toys, as placing them correctly on the rails requires a certain degree of dexterity, and the plastic-bodied rolling stock may break if dropped. However, the level of detail is more basic than the 'real' models produced by the company, with the result that the trains can be handled safely by inexperienced hands without fear of damaging delicate parts.\n\nOther products made by Hornby apart from the OO scale range was a range of clockwork 'Playtrains'. The range first featured Thomas and Percy in sets using 00 track. A new range was then released featuring Thomas, Percy, Toby, Bill and Ben, Annie and Clarabel, and Troublesome Trucks, which ran on red track. The track system also used a playmat similar to a Trak-Mat where additional track and buildings could be placed on the mat illustrations. A battery-powered set featuring Thomas, Annie, Clarabel and Bertie the Bus was also released, which allowed a story recreation of Thomas and Bertie's race. Thomas was unpowered, being pushed along by a motor in Annie.\n\nSee Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway for a detailed article on this topic.\n\nTake-n-Play Thomas & Friends (formerly Take Along Thomas & Friends) is a series of die-cast 'Thomas' models made by Learning Curve and designed for preschool children. The models have superseded the Ertl die-cast models range, which has now been discontinued. The two ranges are incompatible as the new models use special 'two-way' magnets instead of the hook-and-loop couplers provided on the Ertl models.\n\nFirst released at the start of 2002, the models are generally much chunkier, and considerably less accurate, than the Ertl range. Many items in the Ertl range were passable as 'scale' models of the TV Series characters, but the Take Along products are much more obviously toys.\n\nThe range includes all the major and minor characters from the TV series and Movies, plus Mike, Culdee, and D199 from The Railway Series. The rolling stock models include many of the 'special' (non-speaking) trucks that have featured in single episodes, and the vehicles include the members of The Pack. As well as the individual characters, a number of play-sets have been produced, either containing two or more characters, or a single engine with play scene and DVD. Some specials have been produced with a metallic finish, and a few models are fitted with sound chips and lights.\n\nIn 2006, two playsets called Train Yard Set and Working Hard Set were introduced. These were`much bigger than other playsets, being more than 1×1 metres. Original sets were less than 30×30 centimetres.\n\nIn 2010, Take-Along was bought by Mattel and became a Fisher-Price line and renamed \"Take-n-Play\". New characters were released and the old models were re-released with upgraded paints and faces.\n\nIn 2013, the production of the Take-n-Play models was relocated to Thailand (whereas all prior models were manufactured in China, as were the Ertl range models). Coinciding with the move, further changes were made to the models, including redesigned wheels, updated faces that more closely resemble those of the CGI series rather than the model series, and other additional changes.\n\nIn 2017, Mattel retooled the line into Thomas Adventures. There are characters from \"\" and other recent Thomas movies in this line as well as the models recycled from Take-n-Play. Some of these are just the Collectible Railway models repackaged. All of these models have hook couplers similar to Mattel's own trains that they made for Hot Wheels and Matchbox.\n\nIn 2007, HIT Entertainment's subsidiary HIT Toy Company picked up the license to produce the Thomas Motor Road and Rail range. The TrackMaster engines were compatible with Tomy's Motor Road and Rail merchandise. TrackMaster's light brown coloured track was easily connected to the previous blue track from TOMY by track adapters, which were included in every set until new releases after 2008. An innovation in this range was special editions of certain engines, including remote-controlled and face changing variations. In 2010, the rights were put under the ownership of Fisher Price.\n\nIn 2014, Mattel decided to take TrackMaster and completely reinvent it. The trains from this range would now be faster and be able to go up tall hills. This range also saw the track made more realistic. The coaches and rolling stock didn't receive that treatment - they were made smaller so that the engines could go up hills without struggling because of big rolling stock.\n\nTomy have made several ranges of 'Thomas' models.\nThis line was later reworked into Plarail, a Japanese version of Tomy.\nTomy did many models, the most odd choice was Oliver only being released in UK-JPN but not in the US. Thomas had many variations, including a talking variant. You can tell the engines apart from Trackmaster because early Trackmaster has grey Traction Tyres, While Tomy has Peach-coloured.\nTomy Got cancelled when Hit toy company took over.\n\n\"See Thomas Motor Road & Rail below.\"\n\nIn 1997 Tomy made a range of wind-up models that 'have an action when you wind them up'. The range was small and included only a few of the 'major' characters.\n\nIn 2006 another range was introduced. More characters were modelled than previously, and some had moving side rods. Additional models from the range were released in Japan.\n\nFrom 1998 onwards, a significant range from Tomix has been introduced providing an electric N gauge Thomas system which was still unique in 2007 and which then included 4 locomotives: Thomas, Percy, James and Henry. Some of the rolling stock looked similar to Graham Farish items.\n\nTomy and Plarail have Peach-Couloured Traction Tyres, While Trackmaster has Grey-Coloured Traction Tyres.\n\nMy First Thomas & Friends is a range of chunky plastic toys, produced by British toy company: Golden Bear Toys.\n\nThe range started in 1994, and was advertised for young infants who enjoyed the series. The models were safe for younger fans to play with.\n\nThe range started with only a dozen or so models, and has now grown to around 40–45, the range was (for a short-lived amount of time) available in America, under the company Tomy. The toys are still available in many good retail toy shops all around the UK, and despite speculation that perhaps the range has discontinued, after the absence of three years without new products; brand new models have started to appear on Amazon.\n\nThe range included most of the major and minor characters from the TV Series.\n\nThis brand name was used in the Oscar-winning short film \"Logorama\".\n\nThe talking versions of the My First models were first released in the year 2000. The models are more complex than the basic ones, their eyes move, and they speak familiar phrases from the original stock narrations of Ringo Starr and Michael Angelis.\n\nA large number of die-cast vehicles released resembled the \"Gold Rail\" models made by Ertl. However, this series had more characters, although none from The Railway Series. Most characters from Seasons 1–5 were made. The last new model, to date, is Jack the Frontloader. There have been 4 sets made for this range. Other than this Bandai had made small plastic toys (as big as an index finger) labelled \"Pocket Thomas.\" There is another series where plastic models (as big as the die-casts) are sold mostly at convenience stores along with candy such as mints and feature more minor characters such as the Mailvan.\n\nIn 2002, Bachmann USA made their own H0-scale electric Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends range for the US and Canada markets. The models are made with new body tools, to resemble the characters in the TV series. So far over two dozen models have been produced, along with character-themed train sets. Unlike Hornby's products, Bachmann's models have moving eyes.\n\nIn January 2009, Bachmann announced that, in an agreement with HiT Entertainment, a line of large scale Thomas electric trains will be produced, under the title \"Large Scale Thomas & Friends\".\n\nIn 2015, Bachmann announced a line of Narrow Gauge HOn30 Scale trains.\n\nMärklin, a German model train maker, released a limited range of Thomas & Friends merchandise in HO scale. Because of copyright reasons (using Hornby's toolings), they were only available in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, but they did leak out to other countries. They are designed for young children as they have metal frames and plastic shells. They are compatible with the rest of the Märklin range, but are extremely basic and have no extra features. They were only released in 2006.\n\nIn 2005, LEGO introduced the first sets in their Duplo 'Thomas' series. Four sets were made, featuring: James the Red Engine, Thomas the Tank Engine, a Troublesome Truck, Toby the Tram Engine, and Percy the Small Engine. Subsequently, in line with usual Lego practice, new sets had been released each year, featuring different scenes and characters, until Mega Bloks picked up the license in 2010 and have produced Thomas sets of their own.\n\nDuplo is designed for very young children, so the sets have relatively few pieces (between 7 and 62) to assemble.\n\nIn 2006 MV Sports made their own self-assembly Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends engines and buildings. The range consists of the following models:\n\n\nIn 2009 Mega Bloks made buildable Thomas & Friends models such as Percy, Thomas and Diesel and sets too. This line was ended in 2017.\n\nIn 2017, Mega Bloks made larger versions of Diesel, Thomas Percy, James and a few others in their attempt of \"preschoolizing\" the toys. They made new sets to go along with these. \n\nA number of different educational software packages and video games, all based on a 'Thomas' theme, have been released for a variety of different computer platforms.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5285862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5285862", "title": "Thrillville", "text": "Thrillville\n\nThrillville is a simulation and strategy video game that depicts theme park management, very similar to \"RollerCoaster Tycoon\", which Frontier Developments also developed. \"Thrillville\" is available for PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and, in North America, Xbox.\n\nThe player is left a voice message by the player’s Uncle Mortimer (Brian Greene), an eccentric inventor and theme park owner with a voice and personality similar to Emmett Brown, who has reviewed the player's roller coaster designs. Enamored with the designs, he tasks the player with managing his theme park, Thrillville. After successfully managing Thrillville, a competitor, billionaire Vernon Garrison, enters the market with his brand Globo-Joy. The player is assigned to manage Thrillville Timewarp, a park with many rides and attractions that are broken down. Additionally, it is discovered that Globo-Joy is sabotaging the park. After restoring Timewarp and undoing Globo-Joy's sabotage, the player is sent to manage Thrillville Paradise, where Globo-Joy is using bugs to commit corporate espionage and steal Mortimer's ideas. After discovering the bugs, Mortimer designs a fake flea-themed park, which Mortimer allows Garrison to think is a real idea. Meanwhile, the player must manage Thrillville Adventures to compete with the increasing popularity of Globo-Joy parks. Finally, Garrison is tricked into stealing Mortimer's idea and creating Lice Land, whose catastrophic failure leads Garrison to file for bankruptcy. The player is then given access to Treasures of Thrillville, the fifth and final park.\n\nThe concept of the game is to design and build a theme park that will satisfy tourists looking for a thrill. Park guests must be kept happy by use of roller coasters and race tracks, carnival rides, and games like bumper cars and arcade games. In party play mode, players can play all the minigames available against the computer or friends. The player can build facilities that would be available in amusement parks, such as bathrooms, food stalls, drink stalls, and even hat and balloon stalls. The player may also talk and interact with their guests to become friends. If using a teen character, the player may also flirt with the opposite sex. The player can play minigames to gain money, make loans, and hire staff to clean, entertain, and fix rides. Keeping park guests happy will increase publicity and money. \n\nThe game provides missions to the players, divided into five categories: upkeep, which involves taking control of staff to keep the park in working order; build, which involves building and upgrading attractions; games, which involves playing and winning games throughout the park; business, which involves managing the park's finances, advertisement campaigns, etc.; and guests, which involves interacting with the park's guests. After completing enough missions, the player is allowed to move onto another theme park.\n\nThere are five parks in total: Thrillville, Thrillville Timewarp, Thrillville Paradise, Thrillville Adventures, and Treasures of Thrillville; each park is divided into three sections with their own unique theme.\n\nThe game received \"average\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n\"The A.V. Club\" gave the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions a B, saying: \"You'll be extremely busy when you get started. Luckily, the game is forgiving, so you don't have to worry about going out of business if you'd rather go off and train cheerleaders. It's your park; have fun with it.\" However, \"The Times\" gave the PS2 and PSP versions three stars out of five, saying: \"There is plenty to do in the management of the park and great rewards for success. However, all this is undermined because it is much more fun to play one of the driving, mini-golf, shooting or football games than do all the menial things.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave the PS2 version two stars out of five, saying that \"A trip to Thrillville takes you on a long, unnecessary detour through Dullsville.\"\n\nA sequel, \"\", was released on October 16, 2007 for PSP, Wii, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS.\n\nFrontier Developments returned to create \"Off the Rails\" for all mentioned platforms, except for the DS version, which was developed by DC Studios instead. The game features over 20 rides and over 30 minigames, as well as new types of coasters called Whoa! Coasters.\n\nFrontier Developments continued their development of theme park management games with the release of \"Planet Coaster\" in 2016.\n"}

She is the daughter of film actor and comedian Charlie Chaplin from his fourth wife, Oona O'Neill, and the granddaughter of playwright Eugene O'Neill.\n\nChaplin was born in the United States, but grew up in Switzerland. As a teenager, she appeared as an extra in her father's last film, \"A Countess from Hong Kong\" (1966). Her father also wanted her to star in the main role of a winged girl found from the Amazonian rainforest in his next planned film, \"The Freak\", in 1969. However, the project was never filmed because of his declining health and because Victoria eloped with the French actor Jean-Baptiste Thierrée.\n\nChaplin and Thierrée had first come into contact after he read about Chaplin's aspiration of becoming a circus clown in a magazine article of her father, and asked her to form a new type of circus with him. Soon after their elopement they briefly appeared as two clowns in Federico Fellini's \"The Clowns\" (1970), and the next year performed for the first time with the contemporary circus \"Le Cirque Bonjour\", which they had founded together, at Festival d'Avignon. In 1974, they founded a new, smaller circus, \"Le Cirque Imaginaire\", which centered only on their, and occasionally their children's, performances, and from 1990 onwards have performed under the name \"Le Cirque Invisible\".\n\nChaplin and Thierrée have two children, Aurélia Thierrée, (born 24 September 1971), and James Thierrée, (born 2 May 1974), who are also performing artists. In addition to performing in \"Le Cirque Invisible\", Chaplin has also helped in creating her children's shows, and in 2006 was awarded the French national theatre prize, the Molière Award, for designing the costumes for her son's show, \"The Junebug Symphony\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41441569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41441569", "title": "Water puppetry", "text": "Water puppetry\n\nWater puppetry (, lit. \"Making puppets dance on water\") is a tradition that dates back as far as the 11th century when it originated in the villages of the Red River Delta area of northern Vietnam. Today's Vietnamese water puppetry is a unique variation on the ancient Asian puppet tradition.\n\nThe puppets are made out of wood and then lacquered. The shows are performed in a waist-deep pool. A large bamboo rod supports the puppet under the water and is used by the puppeteers, who are normally hidden behind a screen, to control them. Thus the puppets appear to be moving over the water. When the rice fields would flood, the villagers would entertain each other using this form of puppet play.\n\nModern water puppetry is performed in a pool of water 4 meters square with the water surface being the stage. Performance today occurs on one of three venues—on traditional ponds in villages where a staging area has been set up, on portable tanks built for traveling performers, or in a specialized building where a pool stage has been constructed.\n\nUp to 8 puppeteers stand behind a split-bamboo screen, decorated to resemble a temple facade, and control the puppets using long bamboo rods and string mechanism hidden beneath the water surface. The puppets are carved out of wood and often weigh up to 15 kg.\n\nRice, the main staple of the Vietnamese diet, grows in a water paddy. The original water puppet festivals were literally held inside a rice paddy, with a pagoda built on top to hide the puppeteers who stand in the waist-deep water. The water acts as the stage for the puppets, and as a symbolic link to the rice harvest. It also hides the puppet strings and puppeteer movements, improves the musical and vocal acoustics, and provides a shimmering lighting effect.\n\nA traditional Vietnamese orchestra provides background music accompaniment. The instrumentation includes vocals, drums, wooden bells, cymbals, horns, Đàn bầu (monochord), gongs, and bamboo flutes. The bamboo flute's clear, simple notes may accompany royalty while the drums and cymbals may loudly announce a fire-breathing dragon's entrance.\n\nSingers of chèo (a form of opera originating in north Vietnam) sing songs which tell the story being acted out by the puppets. The musicians and the puppets interact during performance; the musicians may yell a word of warning to a puppet in danger or a word of encouragement to a puppet in need.\n\nThe puppets enter from either side of the stage, or emerge from the murky depths of the water.\n\nSpotlights and colorful flags adorn the stage and create a festive atmosphere.\n\nThe theme of the skits is rural and has a strong reference to Vietnamese folklore. It tells of day-to-day living in rural Vietnam and Vietnamese folk tales that are told by grandparents to their grandchildren. Stories of the harvest, of fishing and of festivals are highlighted.\n\nLegends and national history are also told through short skits. Many of the skits, especially those involving the tales of day-to-day living, often have a humorous twist.\n\nChú Tễu (\"chú\" means uncle, man, boy or Mr. in Vietnamese) is a recurrent and the most notable character in water puppetry. Tễu means \"laugh\" in ancient Vietnamese. He is a jester who provides witty comments on political and social realities, especially officials' corruption. His appearance is of a smiling boy who often wears nothing but a simple loincloth, sometimes accompanied by a simple open vest.\n\n"}

{"id": "19872132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19872132", "title": "Wild Side Story", "text": "Wild Side Story\n\nWild Side Story is a parody musical that originated in 1973 as a drag show on the gay scene of Miami Beach, soon developed there into an underground happening for mixed audiences, and up until 2004 was performed hundreds of times in Florida, Sweden, California and Spain.\n\nDescending from a musical family, Swedish-American producer, author and entertainment director Lars Jacob went to Florida at the age of 22 to work as a desk clerk at the Doral Hotel, and there part-time also continued his recent Swedish career as a disc jockey. With Logan Carter and a handful of young Cuban refugees who were doing drag in Miami Beach he created a stage show which did a campy parody of \"West Side Story\", but also included independent material. \"Wild Side Story\" first opened officially at the Ambassador III on August 8, 1973, and by 1974 moved down 22nd Street to Larry Boxx's new Stonewall of Miami Beach; the Florida performances starred Rena Del Rio (Rene Zequeira). \n\nIn 1975 Lars Jacob went back to Sweden and produced shows for one of the earliest Stockholm nightclubs Alexandra’s, thus introducing drag shows to Sweden. In 1976 he brought his \"Wild Side Story\" to the stage there with local people, since a European tour, which Danny La Rue had tried to help him set up, had failed to materialize with the Florida cast because of their refugee status. A few months later he went back to the United States and a front desk job at The Beverly Hills Hotel. On the side he again built up an underground ensemble which intermittently played \"Wild Side Story\", with a few adjustments to Californian culture, at alternating venues from 1977 until the beginning of the 1980s, most prominently at Osko's. In 1976 his basic plot of \"Wild Side Story\" had been registered with the Writers Guild of America West by Jacob and business partner Richard Max Mersky of Mimical Productions, and in California they called their show a \"mimical lampoon\". A young was their stage manager.\n\nUntil 2004 the show was performed more than 500 times in Florida, Stockholm, Los Angeles and Spain, since 1997 called a \"mimical humoresque\". On its 40th anniversary in 2013 the whole \"Wild Side Story\" was played twice again in a 17th-century cellar cave dedicated to Michelangelo's \"David\" in the Old Town of Stockholm.\n\nIn the beginning all the songs were performed to playback recordings; later individual combinations of playback, live singing and sound recordings were arranged. That is to say that practically throughout the one-hour show, the cast carried out its roles by lip synching to pre-recorded songs. An overdone type of lip and tongue movement enhanced the cast’s satirical treatment of the original recordings used, and of the plot.\n\nThe actors were usually young amateurs from the respective local scenes, who made their stage debuts, such as designer Christer Lindarw, model Jimmie Kersmo, drama college graduates Helena Mattsson, Mohombi Moupondo and Patrik Hont, as well as eventual Counter Strike champion Miguel Bonett. Lars Jacob and his Californian production assistant Rosalie De La Torre have both been given credit for discovering Lindarw, who soon became a big star in Sweden. In Los Angeles and in later Swedish productions the piece was played by professional casts and with enhanced scenography and technology.\n\nThree of the nine roles call for male actors to play exaggerated drag queens, and since 1976 three of the roles are also cast with three real women, one of whom plays a drag king. Suddenly when an audience is getting used to the constant lip synching, the character Tony breaks out into a live satire on the \"Maria\" song, called \"Maria in Tony's Thoughts\". Show-goers are also taken by surprise with a staged technical failure where one of the actresses stomps her foot and begins swearing out loud till her number just as unexpectedly resumes. \n\nA few more effects, such as loud foot drumming in \"America\", strobe lighting to slow motion movement and live screams in the catastrophic street \"Rumble\" – and intermittent projection of slide photos (some taken in ballet tutus in the gymnasium of Miami Beach High School) and Super 8 film, have completed the multimedia experience. Recorded narration was added in Los Angeles in 1977 to help audiences grasp plot continuity.\n\nCostumes especially designed and created in 1976 by Maria Knutsson of Sweden's popular Gul&Blå boutiques have continued to be used since then, and the same body language that the director found in the young Cubans already in 1972 has also been preserved to a large extent.\n\nWith about half the music from the classic musical \"West Side Story\", in several versions including instrumentals and comedy renditions, of course that musical is parodied, especially its suicidal \"Romeo and Juliet \" theme.\n\nOther songs are included with Bette Midler, La Lupe, Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, Lou Reed, Alma Cogan (material provided by Adam Faith), Patti Page and Peggy Lee, as well as spicy comments from old Mae West movie scenes, all creating vital parts of the lampoon. In the finale, a Las Vegas performance by Diana Ross of \"Somewhere\" comes up, where she quotes \"Doctor Martin Luther King\" and his dream, while slot machines are making huge money for the hotel. School dancing, sexual and other stereotypes, senseless violence, lovesick carelessness causing blond drunkenness, hippie hypocrisy and the type of comedy of errors reminiscent of Oscar Wilde are also parodied. Pick-pockets, male and female chauvinist pigs, obstructive false eyelashes, mistaken murder and misplaced false boobs are additional spoofed elements.\n\nThe central character José \"Maria\" González dresses up so cleverly as a woman, to try to get a job in a drag show, that Tony falls indiscriminately in love, which leads to the main comedy confusion in the plot, and an opening for the cast to satire \"Romeo and Juliet\" rather severely. \n\nCompeting for that work, and creating a side plot, are two Puerto Rican drag queens Consuelo and Obvióla who make the misunderstood star's life in New York even more miserable, doing \"A Problem Like Maria\" in stolen nuns’ habits, while Tony stumbles through the streets and sings (even in Spanish or Swedish or German when called for): \"Maria, I would never have known or guessed it, but she really is rather flat-chested …\".\n\nMimed Sondheim lyrics are re-performed with new meaning when Maria feels \"pretty and witty and gay\" and \"hardly can believe I’m real\" or an infuriated Anita (to a Carol Burnett version) shouts \"stick to your own kind!\". A reinterpretation of the \"Tonight\" song has Tony torn between self-destructive love pangs and ensuing anatomical suspicion, while Maria to the audience begins to regret causing so much trouble, just to find employment, and finally removes his girl clothes and make-up. Shirley Bassey supplies the lyric in the drag show favorite \"This Is My Life\". In \"Wild Side Story\" the singer’s famous female voice gradually becomes secondary to an increasingly reclaimed masculinity performed by the actor.\n\nEventually, Maria's brother Bernardo and Tony himself and his dumped girlfriend Betty-Sue, created especially for \"Wild Side Story\", all get killed, but they arise from the dead when a fabulously attired soul goddess invokes the spirit of Dr. King (see above) to bring everyone back to life for a \"happy-go-lucky\" ending.\n\nTwo of the young Cuban men in the first cast were so convincing as women that a serious and reputable Miami periodical did a cover story on them as \"women who look like women and smell like women and wear frills and satin and ruffles and lace … featuring two such dedicated lovelies modeling the latest in feminine fashions for real women\". The first show‘s eventual success has been described by eyewitnesses as \"a smash hit … Florida’s great names in female impersonation acted out their bizarre rolls in this bizarre story so the audiences screamed\".\n\nIn Stockholm in the autumn of 1975 Lars Jacob, with Anders Eljas as his debuting band leader and Graham Tainton as his choreographer, had already succeeded well with his first cabaret \"AlexCab\", where drag numbers of an American type were performed for the first time in Sweden. Respected critic Sten Hedman in 1976 called Jacob’s next production \"Wild Side Story\" the \"best show in town … decadent, fun, exciting, talented\", with the soon famous Christer Lindarw, playing Obvióla, almost prophetically named as the best in the show. Writers in major newspapers like \"Dagens Nyheter\" and \" Svenska Dagbladet\" noticeably had a hard time knowing whether to praise or bash such a totally new phenomenon as \"Wild Side Story\", and their reviews came out somewhat perplexed. The latter of the two did single out Steve Vigil in the leading role, as well as Ulla Jones as Betty-Sue and Agneta Lindén as Anita, for charisma and knowhow. (Vigil had seen \"Wild Side Story\" in Florida as early as 1974 and went on after Stockholm to play Bernardo in the California production 1977-1980.) \n\nA few years later in Los Angeles, journalist Michael Kearns headlined his review with \"Wild Side Story\" as \"the talk of the town\", mentioned celebrities in the audience (such as Lehman Engel and Boz Scaggs) and added \"the most unusual thing you’ve ever seen\", while a local gay magazine called it a \"fun, campy evening’s entertainment\" and \"the cast is lively and Jacob’s direction is fast paced … a dashing Tony … beautiful, touching, tender Maria …\" and the two drag queens \"the riotous part of the show\".\nIn 1997, again in Stockholm, reviewers made comments like \"a completely wild evening\" and \"a hilarious parody, an inspiring show of ingenuity, an alternative hysterical\", and in Spain in 2000 the show’s and its director’s histories were highlighted advantageously. Later that year another Stockholm writer for the first time called \"Wild Side Story\" a \"cult show\". In 2003 and 2004 the capital city‘s tourism people in their magazine called the piece \"a cult classic … wonderful evening of singing, dancing and music in a fast-paced parody\", with \"laughter, fun, pantomime, dancing and music, \"Wild Side Story\" pokes fun at the foibles of human behavior and much more\". In 2003 the drag queens were noted by Sweden’s leading gay publication as played by \"rather beefy guys with hairy armpits\".\n\nLars Jacob has been interviewed on television in Sweden about \"Wild Side Story\". In a live broadcast for the public access station Öppna Kanalen in 1997 he said: \"Since I was 13-14 years old I’ve always found it so confusing with all the sexual hypocrisy we have in society, and religious hypocrisy and political hypocrisy, so I’m an anti-hypocrisy fanatic – that’s the only thing I’m fanatic about, being against hypocrisy – so that makes it great fun to joke around with double standards and the over-romantization of society, which means that young people hardly have a chance to make it, with all this propaganda we have for romance.“\n\nAgain in 2000 he appeared as the director of \"Wild Side Story\" on Channel 3 in four segments of a popular TV series by Strix (\"Baren\"), where he said \"there’s nothing really lewd in the show, but there’s a lot of fun poked at sexuality and romance and \"True Love\" and all that\", and speaking of yet another brave cast of his, \"I think it‘s great with people who dare, and people who make something special out of life, not like Princess Madeleine like 'I want to live a regular life' – huh? My God! She belongs to five of the most unusual families in the world, this girl, and the poor thing is forced to say things like 'I want to live a regular life'!\".\n\n"}

She moved into vaudeville, joining Al Reeves show \"Big Burlesque Review\" both with a piano act and acting in light comedy routines. Her piano specialty was playing pop tunes of the day in a classical arrangement. Her playing was so popular that it often \"stopped\" the show, the audience demanding she keep playing. Newspaper profiles of the day credit her with attending the New England Conservatory of Music, but this cannot be confirmed by their records.\n\nShe married Harry Kennedy Morton, a fellow vaudevillian. She had one son, Harold Morton, Jr., who died in childhood.\n\nShe died in February 1, 1952 in the Somerville, Massachusetts area. Her husband died in May 1956.\n\n\n\n\n"}
