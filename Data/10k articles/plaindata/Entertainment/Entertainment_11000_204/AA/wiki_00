It is based on a traditional Ghanaian tale of a daughter who rejects suitors proposed by her parents, Osam and Badua, and marries a stranger who ultimately is revealed as the Devil in disguise. The play is set in the 1870s on the Gold Coast, and tells the story of the heroine Anowa's failed marriage to the slave trader Kofi Ako.\n\nThe play has a unique trait where a couple, an old man and an old woman, play the role of the Chorus. They present themselves at crucial points in the play and give their own views on the events in the play.\n\nAnowa's attitude of being a modern independent woman angers Kofi Ako. He requests her to be like other normal women. Anowa lives in a hallucinated world and the sorrow of not bearing a child depresses her. Her rich husband, now frustrated with his wife asks her to leave him. Anowa argues with him and finds out that he had lost his ability to bear children and the fault was in him and not in her. This disclosure of the truth drives Kofi Ako to shoot himself and Anowa drowns herself.\n\nAnowa represents the modern woman who likes to make her own decisions and live life as per her choice. An additional conflict is that although a tribal woman, she has the traits of a city-bred. Her attitude leads to her destruction.\n\n"}

Each contestant sings the first verse of a song (often Classical Hindustani or Bollywood songs) that begins with the Hindustani consonant on which the previous contestant's song selection ended.\n\nThe word is derived from two Sanskrit words: \nWhen these words are combined and an '-i' suffixed, the term means \"The game of the ending letter\". \n\nIt is known as \"Anthyakshari\" the same as Sanskrit only in Telugu and no other Indian language.\nDue to schwa syncope in Hindi and other Indo-Aryan languages,\nAnthakshari is pronounced\nAnthakshari was originally present in the Ramayana, where rishis (sages) sang the first verses of bhajanas continuously by singing another Bhajana beginning with the last letter of the ending word.\n\nThe game can be played by two or more people and is popular as a group activity during commutes, bus rides etc. The first singer has to sing two complete lines and then s/he may stop at the end of those or following lines. The last Hindi letter of the last word sung is then used by the next singer to sing another song, starting with that letter. The winner or winning team is decided by a process of elimination. The person or team that cannot come up with a song with the right consonant is eliminated if their opponents can produce such a song.\n\nThe game is often kicked off with the consonant /m/ (म or م) with the recitation of the following couplet which varies, but usually has wording similar to -\n\nBaithe, baithe, kya karein? Karna hai kuch kaam, <br>\nShuru karo antakshri, leke prabhu/rabb ka naam! <br>\n\n\nIt started as a family pastime. Now there are several TV shows and competitions all over India based on it. The classic style is where two or more teams sing songs which start with last consonant letter of the song sung by previous team. When a team sings a song they earn points.\n\nA popular Indian television program by the same name has run successfully on Zee TV for over 10 years. Annu Kapoor was the permanent male host while female hosts included Durga Jasraj, Renuka Shahane, Pallavi Joshi, Shefali, Rajeshwari Sachdev & Richa Sharma . Contestants have ranged from school and college-goers to housewives, professionals and celebrities. Mr.Gajendra Singh is known as the Creator of Musical Reality shows in India, Talent Scout extraordinaire’ and a true Visionary who revolutionized the Indian Cable TV scene.

{"id": "246903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246903", "title": "Apologetics", "text": "Apologetics\n\nApologetics (from Greek , \"speaking in defense\") is the religious discipline of defending religious doctrines through systematic argumentation and discourse. Early Christian writers (c. 120–220) who defended their beliefs against critics and recommended their faith to outsiders were called Christian apologists. In 21st-century usage, \"apologetics\" is often identified with debates over religion and theology.\n\nThe term \"apologetics\" derives from the Ancient Greek word \"apologia\". In the Classical Greek legal system, two key technical terms were employed: the prosecution delivered the \"kategoria\" (κατηγορία), and the defendant replied with an \"apologia\". To deliver an \"apologia\" meant making a formal speech or giving an explanation to reply and rebut the charges, as in the case of Socrates' Apologia defense, as chronicled in Plato's \"Apology\" (the defense speech of Socrates at his trial). This term appears in the Koine Greek of the New Testament. The Apostle Paul employs the term \"apologia\" in his trial speech to Festus and Agrippa when he says \"I make my defense\" in Acts 26:2. A cognate form appears in Paul's Letter to the Philippians as he is \"defending the gospel\" in Philippians 1:7, and in \"giving an answer\" in 1 Peter 3:15.\n\nAlthough the term \"apologetics\" has Western, primarily Christian origins and is most frequently associated with the defense of Christianity, the term is sometimes used referring to the defense of any religion in formal debate involving religion.\n\nMany apologetic books have been written in defence of the history or teachings of the Bahá'í Faith. The religion's founders wrote several books presenting proofs of their religion, among them are the Báb's \"Seven Proofs\" and Bahá'u'lláh's \"Kitáb-i-Íqán\". Later Bahá'í authors wrote prominent apologetic texts, such as Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl's \"The Brilliant Proof\" and Udo Schaefer et al.'s \"Making the Crooked Straight\";.\n\nOne of the earliest Buddhist apologetic texts is \"The Questions of King Milinda\", which deals with the Buddhist metaphysics such as the \"no-self\" nature of the individual and characteristics such as of wisdom, perception, volition, feeling, consciousness and the soul. In the mid-19th century, encounters between Buddhists and Christians in Japan prompted the formation of a Buddhist Propagation Society . In recent times, A. L. De Silva, an Australian convert to Buddhism, has written a book, \"Beyond Belief\", providing Buddhist apologetic responses and a critique of Christian Fundamentalist doctrine. Gunapala Dharmasiri wrote an apologetic critique of the Christian concept of God from a Theravadan Buddhist perspective.\n\nChristian apologetics combines Christian theology, natural theology, and philosophy to present a rational basis for the Christian faith, to defend the faith against objections and misrepresentation.\n\nChristian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries. In the Roman Empire, Christians were severely persecuted, and many charges were brought against them. J. David Cassel gives several examples: Tacitus wrote that Nero fabricated charges that Christians started the burning of Rome. Other charges included cannibalism (due to a literal interpretation of the Eucharist) and incest (due to early Christians' practice of addressing each other as \"brother\" and \"sister\"). Saul of Tarsus, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus and others often defended Christianity against charges that were brought to justify persecution.\n\nLater apologists have focused on providing reasons to accept various aspects of Christian belief. Christian apologists of many traditions, in common with Jews, Muslims, and some others, argue for the existence of a unique and personal God. Theodicy is one important aspect of such arguments, and Alvin Plantinga's arguments have been highly influential in this area. Many prominent Christian apologists are scholarly philosophers or theologians, frequently with additional doctoral work in physics, cosmology, comparative religions, or other fields. Others take a more popular or pastoral approach. Some prominent modern apologists are Douglas Groothuis, Frederick Copleston, John Lennox, Walter R. Martin, Dinesh D'Souza, Douglas Wilson, Cornelius Van Til, Gordon Clark, Francis Schaeffer, Greg Bahnsen, Edward John Carnell, James White, R.C. Sproul, Hank Hanegraaff, Ravi Zacharias, Alister McGrath, Lee Strobel, Josh McDowell, Peter Kreeft, G. K. Chesterton, C. S. Lewis, William Lane Craig, J. P. Moreland, Hugh Ross, David Bentley Hart, Gary Habermas, Norman Geisler and Scott Hahn.\n\nNotable apologists within the Catholic Church include Bishop Robert Barron, G. K. Chesterton, Dr. Scott Hahn, Patrick Madrid, Kenneth Hensley, Karl Keating, Ronald Knox, Peter Kreeft, and Gus Loyd.\n\nJohn Henry Newman (February 21, 1801 – August 11, 1890) was an English convert to Roman Catholicism, later made a cardinal, and beatified in 2010. In early life he was a major figure in the Oxford Movement to bring the Church of England back to its Catholic roots. Eventually his studies in history persuaded him to become a Roman Catholic. When John Henry Newman entitled his spiritual autobiography \"Apologia Pro Vita Sua\" in 1864, he was playing upon both this connotation, and the more commonly understood meaning of an expression of contrition or regret.\n\nChristian apologists employ a variety of philosophical and formal approaches, including ontological, cosmological, and teleological arguments. The Christian presuppositionalist approach to apologetics utilizes the transcendental argument for the existence of God.\n\nTertullian was a notable early Christian apologist. He was born, lived and died in Carthage. He is sometimes known as the \"Father of the Latin Church\". He introduced the term \"Trinity\" (Latin \"trinitas\") to the Christian vocabulary and also probably the formula \"three Persons, one Substance\" as the Latin \"tres Personae, una Substantia\" (itself from the Koine Greek \"treis Hypostaseis, Homoousios\"), and also the terms \"Vetus Testamentum\" (Old Testament) and \"Novum Testamentum\" (New Testament).\n\nThere are notable Latter-day Saint apologists who focus on the defense of Mormonism, including early church leaders such as Parley P. Pratt, John Taylor, B. H. Roberts, James E. Talmage and more modern figures such as Hugh Nibley, Orson Scott Card, and Jeff Lindsay.\n\nSeveral well-known Mormon apologetic organizations, such as the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (a group of scholars at Brigham Young University) and FairMormon (an independent, Mormon-run, not-for-profit group), have been formed to defend the doctrines and history of the Latter Day Saint movement in general and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in particular.\n\nDeism is a form of theism in which God created the universe and established rationally comprehensible moral and natural laws but no longer intervenes in human affairs. Deism is a natural religion where belief in God is based on application of reason and evidence observed in the designs and laws found in nature. The World Order of Deists maintains a web site presenting deist apologetics that demonstrate the existence of God based on evidence and reason, absent divine revelation.\n\nHindu apologetics began developing during the British colonial period. A number of Indian intellectuals had become critical of the British tendency to devalue the Hindu religious tradition. As a result, these Indian intellectuals, as well as a handful of British Indologists, were galvanized to examine the roots of the religion as well as to study its vast arcana and corpus in an analytical fashion. This endeavor drove the deciphering and preservation of Sanskrit. Many translations of Hindu texts were produced which made them accessible to a broader reading audience.\n\nA range of Indian philosophers, including Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo Ghose, have written rational explanations regarding the values of the Hindu religious tradition. More modern proponents such as the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi have also tried to correlate recent developments from quantum physics and consciousness research with Hindu concepts. The late Reverend Pandurang Shastri Athavale has given a plethora of discourses regarding the symbolism and rational basis for many principles in the Vedic tradition. In his book \"The Cradle of Civilization\", David Frawley, an American who has embraced the Vedic tradition, has characterized the ancient texts of the Hindu heritage as being like \"pyramids of the spirit\". A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada translated over sixty volumes of classic Vedic scriptures including the biography and conclusions of the famous 16th century bhakti scholar Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu; many of these translations and commentaries have been further translated into as many as eighty languages, producing over half a billion books distributed throughout the world. Such individuals have tried to construct an intellectual defense of Hinduism during a phase when the fundamentalistic elements of other faiths have sought to denigrate the ancient religion in an effort to gain converts.\n\n\"Ilm al-Kalām\", literally \"science of discourse\", usually foreshortened to \"kalam\" and sometimes called \"Islamic scholastic theology\", is an Islamic undertaking born out of the need to establish and defend the tenets of Islamic faith against doubters and detractors. A scholar of \"kalam\" is referred to as a \"mutakallim\" (plural \"mutakallimūn\") as distinguished from philosophers, jurists, and scientists.\n\nJewish apologetic literature can be traced back as far as Aristobulus of Paneas, though some discern it in the works of Demetrius the chronographer (3rd century BCE) traces of the style of \"questions\" and \"solutions\" typical of the genre. Aristobulus was a Jewish philosopher of Alexandria and the author of an apologetic work addressed to Ptolemy VI Philometor. Josephus's Contra Apion is a wide-ranging defense of Judaism against many charges laid against Judaism at that time, as too are some of the works of Philo of Alexandria.\n\nIn response to modern Christian missionaries, and congregations that \"are designed to appear Jewish, but are actually fundamentalist Christian churches, which use traditional Jewish symbols to lure the most vulnerable of our Jewish people into their ranks\", Jews for Judaism is the largest counter-missionary organization in existence, today. Kiruv Organisation, founded by Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi, and Outreach Judaism, founded by Rabbi Tovia Singer, are other prominent international organizations that respond \"directly to the issues raised by missionaries and cults, by exploring Judaism in contradistinction to fundamentalist Christianity.\"\n\nSome pantheists have formed organizations such as the World Pantheist Movement and the Universal Pantheist Society to promote and defend the belief in pantheism.\n\nIn a famous speech called \"Red Jacket on Religion for the White Man and the Red\" in 1805, Seneca chief Red Jacket gave an apologetic for Native American religion.\n\nPlato's \"Apology\" may be read as both a religious and literary apology; however, more specifically literary examples may be found in the prefaces and dedications, which proceed many Early Modern plays, novels, and poems. Eighteenth century authors such as Colley Cibber, Frances Burney, and William Congreve, to name but a few, prefaced the majority of their poetic work with such apologies. In addition to the desire to defend their work, the apologetic preface often suggests the author's attempt to humble his- or herself before the audience.\n\n"}
{"id": "36042117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36042117", "title": "Beyond: Two Souls", "text": "Beyond: Two Souls\n\nBeyond: Two Souls is an interactive drama and action-adventure game for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 home video game consoles, developed by Quantic Dream and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released in October 2013. The game features Jodie Holmes, one of two player characters. The other is an incorporeal entity named Aiden: a separate soul linked to Jodie since birth. Jodie, who is portrayed by actress Ellen Page, possesses supernatural powers through her psychic link to Aiden, growing from adolescence to adulthood while learning to control Aiden and the powers they share. Willem Dafoe co-stars as Nathan Dawkins, a researcher in the Department of Paranormal Activity and Jodie's surrogate-father-figure. The actors in the game worked during the year-long project in Quantic Dream's Paris studio to perform on-set voice acting and motion-capture acting.\n\nDespite being a video game, \"Beyond: Two Souls\" premiered at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival, marking only the second time the film festival recognised a video game. David Cage, writer and director of the game, explained that game development studios should provide \"interactive storytelling\" that can be played by everyone, including non-gamers. The game received polarised critical reception upon its release. Sales reached over one million copies two months after its worldwide release by the end of 2013. Two years later, a PlayStation 4 version was released, both as a standalone title and then in the \"Quantic Dream Collection\" with the 2010 title \"Heavy Rain\".\n\n\"Beyond: Two Souls\" is an interactive drama and action-adventure game, requiring the player to move and guide the character into interactions with objects and other non-player characters in the scene to progress the story. The player primarily controls Jodie through the in-game environments. At almost any time, however, the player (or second player during a two-player game) can switch to control Aiden instead. Aiden, as an incorporeal entity, exists permanently in noclip mode and can move through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles; however, he is limited to moving only within a certain radius around Jodie due to their spiritual tethering.\n\nWhile playing as Jodie, the game includes interactive objects marked with a white dot, which can be interacted with by tilting the controller stick in its direction. If Jodie must perform a specific action, icons pop up on the screen to prompt the player to press and/or hold certain controller buttons. Conversation prompts float in the air, defaulting to a certain choice if too much time passes before selection. During action sequences, like chases or hand-to-hand combat, the cinematography moves into slow motion whilst Jodie performs the physical manoeuvre; during this time, the player must determine the direction Jodie is moving and push the controller stick in that direction to complete the action. Other sequences require real-time stealth, which has the player sneak Jodie through environments while coordinating certain actions with Aiden. Failing certain action sequences will alter the course of a chapter (and sometimes later chapters) and in some cases lead to the death of a non-playable character.\n\nWhile playing as Aiden, the game becomes monochromatic. Amongst the shades of greys, interactive objects are highlighted by an aura shining in one of several colours, with the colour of the aura indicating his potential interaction: orange characters can be possessed, red characters strangled, blue objects (or characters with environmental effects) knocked around, and green characters healed. Jodie frequently calls upon Aiden to provide different abilities, such as form a protective shield around her, allow the dead to speak to the living through her, grant her an ability to see events of the recent past, and enable her to heal a character's wounds.\n\nAs the player makes choices throughout the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, the outcome of entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated to a certain extent based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardise the mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of \"Beyond: Two Souls\", as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.\n\nYoung Jodie Holmes (Caroline Wolfson) lives with her foster parents in a suburban home. Since birth, Jodie has had a psychic connection with a mysterious entity named Aiden, with whom she can communicate and perform telepathic acts, such as possessing people's minds and manipulating certain objects. After an incident with some neighbourhood kids results in Aiden almost killing one of them, Jodie's foster parents seek help to care for her condition, permanently leaving her under the custody of doctors Nathan Dawkins (Willem Dafoe) and Cole Freeman (Kadeem Hardison) of the United States Department of Paranormal Activity.\n\nUnder the two doctors' care, Jodie slowly learns to control Aiden and the powers they share. During this time, Nathan and Cole are building the condenser, a portal that connects the world of the living with the world of the dead—the Infraworld. One night, Nathan learns that his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident. While trying to comfort him, Jodie discovers that she can channel spirits of the dead from the Infraworld; she helps the spirits speak to the living through a psychic link created by her physical contact. As the years pass, a teenage Jodie (Ellen Page) seeks her independence, both from the doctors and from Aiden, and tries several times to live a normal life. At each attempt, Aiden intervenes, ending in disaster.\n\nAt one point, Nathan asks for Jodie's help with the condenser, which has broken open. After braving hostile entities from the Infraworld, Jodie manages to shut down the condenser and warns Nathan not to build another. This gets the attention of the CIA, who send agent Ryan Clayton (Eric Winter) to forcibly recruit Jodie. After training, the now-adult Jodie goes on multiple missions as a field agent, often with Ryan, to whom she slowly becomes attracted. On one such mission in Somalia, Jodie learns that the target she killed was not a warlord, but the country's benign president. An enraged Jodie flees in disgust, despite Ryan's pleas. Branded a traitor, Jodie becomes a fugitive, evading pursuing CIA forces. Along the way, she befriends a small group of homeless people, one of whom she helps give birth to a girl named Zoey, and she lives with a family of Native Americans, during which she encounters another love interest named Jay and saves them from a malevolent entity. The CIA eventually recaptures Jodie after she attempts to reconnect with her catatonic biological mother, who has been held and forcibly drugged for decades in a military hospital.\n\nThe CIA hands Jodie over to Nathan, now executive director of the DPA, overseeing the DPA's newest condenser, code-named the Black Sun. He reveals that the CIA is willing to let Jodie go if she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy an underwater facility housing a Chinese-developed condenser before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature condenser to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal to let them go is only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed her too dangerous to be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him into the heart of the Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.\n\nDuring the trek towards the Black Sun, Cole is injured by entities and Ryan sacrifices his own safety to keep Jodie alive. Eventually, Jodie confronts Nathan near the Black Sun. He commits suicide to reunite with his family. As Jodie shuts down the condenser, she has a vision—Aiden is her stillborn twin brother. Jodie must make a choice: go back to the world of the living, or go on to the Infraworld and be reunited with everyone she has lost. If Jodie chooses Life, her connection to Aiden is severed and she is no longer useful to the CIA. Jodie must choose how to live her life, either alone or with Ryan, Jay, or Zoey and her family. If Jodie chooses Beyond, she joins Aiden and other lost ones in the Infraworld, dying in the process. She continues to watch over those who remain in the living world, warning the now-teenage Zoey of the coming danger. By the story's end, the Infraworld has become a widespread threat in the not-so-distant future. Jodie prepares to confront the threat.\n\nDavid Cage, founder and CEO of Quantic Dream, announced \"Beyond: Two Souls\" at Sony's press conference during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012. He showed the crowd a debut trailer featuring the game's in-game graphics. When he was asked to compare \"Beyond: Two Souls\" to Quantic Dream's previous game \"Heavy Rain\", Cage described \"Beyond\" as a \"more action-driven experience\" that offers \"much more direct control\" and \"much more spectacular action\" than the 2010 thriller. Cage has called his games \"fully controllable\" while admitting \"when there is an action sequence, yes we integrate these quick time event sequences ... in a new way.\" Unlike Quantic Dream's previous game, \"Beyond\" was not to be PlayStation Move compatible. Earlier games created by Cage, which have been called \"wrought psychological thrillers\", demonstrate that emotional narrative is a critical element in a Quantic Dream game's development. In an interview, actress Ellen Page noted that the script for the game was around 2,000 pages long (an average screenplay is between 95 and 125 pages long; each page is approximately one minute of screen time). \"We'd do 30, 40 pages a day. It's insane compared to a film. Jodie goes through a lot. This is an incredibly emotional story and journey for this girl.\"\n\nQuantic Dream, an advanced motion capture studio as well as video game developer, required the \"Beyond: Two Souls\" actors to perform motion-capture acting as well as on-set voice acting. Ellen Page, Willem Dafoe, Kadeem Hardison, Eric Winter, Caroline Wolfson, and other actors cast in the game worked during the year-long project in the Paris studio to perform the physical actions seen onscreen as performed by their fully realised video game graphic characters. Meanwhile, Quantic Dream programmers, artists, and animators, led by art director Christophe Brusseaux, designed the computer-generated imagery seen in the game. David Cage provided writing and direction and Guillaume de Fondaumière was the executive producer.\n\n\"Beyond: Two Souls\" is dedicated to composer Normand Corbeil, who died of pancreatic cancer on 25 January 2013. Corbeil had worked on Quantic Dream's \"Heavy Rain\" and its predecessor \"Fahrenheit\" and was unable to finish his work on \"Beyond\". Lorne Balfe, who wrote the score for \"Assassin's Creed III\", replaced Corbeil as the game's composer after Corbeil's death. Balfe's collaborator Hans Zimmer joined him as producer in August 2013.\n\nOn 27 April 2013, five months before the game's debut, Quantic Dream released a new trailer and demonstrated 35 minutes of the game at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival, with both Page and Cage in attendance. This marks only the second time the film festival recognised a video game, the first being 2011's \"L.A. Noire\". In interviews conducted immediately prior to the game's worldwide release, Cage explained that development studios like Quantic Dream have an obligation to provide \"interactive storytelling\" that can be played by everyone, including non-gamers.\n\nOn 5 September 2013, the PlayStation Blog announced that a demo for \"Beyond: Two Souls\" would be released 1 October 2013 in the United States, 2 October for Europe, and 3 October for Japan, about a week prior to the full game's worldwide release. Despite the demo's official release date, a few users of the paid subscription service PlayStation Plus were allowed to receive the demo a week earlier, on 24 September 2013. GameStop also gave out a limited number of beta keys on that day. The full game was released on 8 October 2013 in North America, 9 October 2013 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and 11 October 2013 in the UK.\n\nThe European version of the game is censored to keep the PEGI rating at 16 instead of 18. Two changes were made amounting to 5–10 seconds of gameplay.\n\nImmediately after the game was released, nude images of Jodie, actress Ellen Page, surfaced on the Reddit online community. The game did include one nude scene of Jodie—showering, shown at an angle that preserves the character's modesty—however the leaked images were full-frontal. Industry analysts deduced that a person in possession of a developer PlayStation 3 that allowed quality assurance features such as \"free camera\" mode had used the special PlayStation to create and upload the images. Sony immediately took steps to remove them, asking for the community's assistance and explaining that the images were of a digital model and not of Page, who has a \"no nudity\" policy in titles she appears in. The images were removed from the website.\n\nIn June 2015, Quantic Dream announced a PlayStation 4 version of \"Beyond: Two Souls\" for North America, Europe, and the PAL region alongside \"Heavy Rain\". The PlayStation 4 version of \"Beyond: Two Souls\" was released on 24 November, with the remaster of \"Heavy Rain\" following on 1 March 2016. A package containing both games was then released physically on a Blu-ray disc.\n\n\"Beyond: Two Souls\" received polarised reviews upon release. Review aggregator Metacritic described its reception as \"mixed\". Critics praised Page's character portrayal of Jodie Holmes and Dafoe's performance as Nathan Dawkins, as well as the amount of technical details in the game's animations and graphics. Praise was also generally given toward the elaborate motion capture, interactive storytelling mechanics, emotional soundtrack, and ability to appeal to non-gamers. \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" (UK) spoke frankly of a game using quick time events over a more acceptable solution: \"you lose explicit control\", yet believing \"Beyond\" ultimately wins in ways such as its imagery: \"PS3's graphical high point\" and Page's performance: \"Astonishing ... she's the lynchpin that holds all the madness together with a painfully human presence.\" \"GameSpot\" called the game a \"gripping adventure\", observing that the gameplay's choices give the player an ability to shape what kind of person Jodie becomes, making us \"care dearly for her ... and become enamoured with this young woman and her extraordinary life\". \"Game Revolution\" praised the game as \"uncannily gorgeous\", confirming Quantic Dream remains a leader in the story-driven genre, calling their high-quality cinematic gameplay \"the saving grace of \"Beyond: Two Souls\"\". The game received positive reviews from the playerbase, scoring an 8.1/10 on Metacritic's user score.\n\nWhile \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" praised the visuals, the performances, and the \"bold, genre-defying design work\", it expressed disappointment in Quantic Dream; respecting its years of \"audacity\" pushing the boundaries of the game medium, yet ultimately failing to listen to feedback and instead delivering yet \"another flawed experiment—better in some ways, worse in others\". \"IGN\" gaming website criticised the game for offering a gaming experience too passive and unrewarding: \"It is unwise to build up our expectations of being able to choose our actions and then take that away from us where it feels most important\" and a muddy and unfocused interactive drama \"to make gamers conditioned to meaningless violence feel something\". \"Joystiq\" criticised the game's lack of solid character interaction and its unbelievable, unintentionally silly plot. \"Destructoid\" criticised the game's thin character presentation and frequent narrative dead ends, as well as its lack of meaningful interactivity. The editor of \"Eurogamer\" took issue with the \"gruelling, sentimental\" game being \"all story\", comparing it to other games that \"give the player complete control\", observing the triviality of the player choices may modify the tone of each self-contained chapter, but the overall story is \"going wherever it's going\". \"GamesRadar+\" liked the game, but warned \"you'll never be truly challenged by the gameplay\". Entertainer Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw of \"Zero Punctuation\" was heavily critical of the game, focusing on the overuse of quick time events, the underuse of the game's central stealth mechanics, and the inconsistent tone and atmosphere, comparing playing the game to \"watching any normal film and pressing the pause button every two seconds\".\n\nAt Spike's Video Game Awards show, \"Beyond: Two Souls\" earned two nominations: Best Voice Actress (Ellen Page) and Best Voice Actor (Willem Dafoe).\n\nThe British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) nominated the game for Best Artistic Achievement (John Rostron, David Cage, Guillaume De Fondaumiere), Best Original Music (Lorne Balfe), and Best Performer (Ellen Page).\n\nAt the 2013 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards, \"Beyond: Two Souls\" won Game, Original Adventure and was nominated for Lead Performance in a Drama, Supporting Performance in a Drama, Writing in a Drama, Camera Direction in a Game Engine, Animation, Control Design (3D), Graphics (Technical), Lighting/Texturing, and Use of Sound (New IP).\n\nAt the 2012 Game Critics Awards event, the game was nominated for Best Original Game and Best Action/Adventure Game, and the next year, it also earned a nomination for Best Console Game. At the 17th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, it was nominated for three categories: Outstanding Achievement in Story, Outstanding Achievement in Animation and Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition. At the 18th Satellite Awards, \"Beyond: Two Souls\" was nominated for Outstanding Action/Adventure Video Game.\n\nIt was reported in July 2013 that \"Beyond: Two Souls\" was in the top twenty most pre-ordered games of 2013, and that by the end 2013, the game sold one million copies worldwide during its first three months of availability. The game sold over 70,000 copies in Quantic Dream's home country France during that time, more than its previous game \"Heavy Rain\" during its three-month debut. \"Heavy Rain\" budget was $22 million and the budget for \"Beyond: Two Souls\" was $27 million, not including approximately $18 million in costs for marketing and distribution. \"Beyond: Two Souls\" reached 2.8 million copies sold by the time Quantic Dream's next title was released in 2018, becoming one of the best-selling PlayStation 3 video games.\n\nIn November 2014, David Cage discussed the future of video games and referred to the generally negative reviews \"Beyond\" received from hardcore gamers. \"There will always be games for the hardcore gamers who see games as a skill-based sport, or as a way to compete with their friends\", he said. He also referred to casual gamers who play games \"as a mere hobby, like many titles for smartphones\". He then stated, \"We try to develop a middle way, with games that try to tell a story, to carry meaning, and where violence isn't the core activity. Most of all, we try to create an emotion, to make players live something strong and unique, which remains an ambitious challenge in a video game.\"\n\n"}

The Biennale is organised by the Archaos circus company and the first edition in 2015 attracted 60 circus companies from around the world and had more than 85,000 visitors.\n\nThe Archaos circus company is one of the legendary contemporary circus companies in Europe. Their work in Britain changed the way the circus was seen and the founder of Archaos, Pierrot Bidon, was seen as a circus revolutionary. In Bidon's obituary in The Guardian, Archaos was described as \"one of the ensembles that galvanised the new circus movement, in which traditional arts have been re-imagined and combined with contemporary artistic sensibilities and theatrical techniques.\"\n\nThe Biennale itself was born out of the Circus in Capitals project that Archaos managed as part of Marseille-Provence 2013, the European Capital of Culture festivities. The success of the circus arts during the Marseille Provence 2013 inspired the Archaos company to create the first Biennale Internationale des Arts du Cirque in 2015. The first biennale featured circus companies such as Nofit State Circus, Cirque Éloize, and the Chinese State Circus.\n\nThe first Biennale was such a success that in 2016 the company created the L'Entre–Deux Biennales to meet public demand and continue to foster the circus arts in years when the Biennale was not being held. Archaos was nominated for the Best Producer award for the L'Entre-Deux Biennales project at the 2016 Annual International Professional Circus Awards in Sochi, Russia that were organised by the Russian Ministry of Culture. Archaos was also chosen to present performances at the Club France that was held during the Rio Olympics in August 2016.\n\nThe second edition of the Biennale ran from January 21 to February 19, 2017. It featured more than 260 performances in close to 30 cities in the south of France including Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, Grasse, and Gap. The 2017 Biennale included new work from leading British companies NoFit State Circus and Motionhouse, the Swedish company Cirkus Cirkör, and the Brazilian company Borogodo. More than 120,000 people attended events.\n\n"}

He was born in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. His father died in 1877 and Charles and his mother moved to Devon. He grew up to become a county level player in rugby, hockey and cricket, introduced the game of ping-pong to the county, and also competed in shooting.

On iOS, the game hit number one in multiple countries, and has been downloaded over a million times.\n\n\"CTU: Marine Sharpshooter\"'s story details the adventures of Lieutenant Smith and Sergeant Cooper, a US Marine Corps scout sniper, team as they chase down some warlords in Afghanistan and follow the trail of lost nuclear materials. The player assumes the role of the sniper, as you take on an army of terrorists and mercenaries in order to prevent nuclear holocaust.\n\n\"CTU: Marine Sharpshooter\"'s gameplay involves both sniping and close combat. The main shooting mechanic is sniping, with the ability to use the sniper rifle's scope to zoom in on far away targets. Close combat is done with a pistol with an optional silencer, or a knife. Several points in the game require the player to stay in one spot engaging hostiles that emerge from various doorways and windows. At other times, the player can explore the map freely. The game features simulations of the sniper rifles used by the US Marine Corps snipers, as well as other real weapons, such as assault rifles, pistols, and sniper rifles. There is even the occasional RPG used by the enemy.\n\nThe game's environment varies from the caves and small villages of Afghanistan, to the snowy cliffs and rooftops of Chechnya, to sandy beaches and jungles of Pacific island. Interaction between player and environment is minimal.\n\nThe game features a semi-intelligent spotter, who can be set to follow you or hold position, and \"hold fire\" or \"fire at will\". The spotter call out the compass heading of the direction that enemies are in as they come within a certain range. The spotter can also assist the player in engaging enemies. You fail a mission if the spotter dies or if you die.\n\nThe game features a few first-aid kits as standard inventory, which will patch you up a little after taking hits. Your spotter has his own kits, and he will use them during lulls in fighting. You cannot patch him up, nor vice versa. There are also no further kits or ammunition available within the mission. However, small quantities of ammunition can be obtained from the sniper rifles you pick up from dead enemies.\n\n\"CTU: Marine Sharpshooter\" was poorly received, with a score on IGN of 4.1 (bad) and the reviewer, calling it a \"rehash\" and an \"impersonator\" of better titles.\n\nMarine Sharpshooter 2: Jungle Warfare is a sequel to \"CTU: Marine Sharpshooter\" published in June 24 2004. Deployed into one of Africa's most dangerous countries, the objective of the game is to find the President of Burundi and rescue him from heavily armed rebels and the ruthless mercenaries who back them. If the rebels are not stopped and the President dies, they will plunge the region into a brutal civil war.\n\n"}

The game takes place in a day's work for Chuck as he rescues POWs from Cambodia and fights off Communist invaders in the USA. The game is littered with Chuck Norris facts and incorporates a number of these into the gameplay; such as shooting down a helicopter by pointing his finger and yelling BANG! \n\nPlayers use the on-screen joystick to move Chuck and the punch button to attack. Like other side scrolling beat 'em ups, you can utilize the environment around you, picking up different objects, such as cars, to use against the enemy.

Such ability is also called the prerequisite condition for laughter. The conditional joke is one of two main categories of jokes, according to Ted Cohen; the main one being a universal joke, which does not require familiarity with the hermetic language of a conditional joke. The conditional, or \"hermetic\" jokes, often depend on the internalized negative stereotypes held by the audience toward a targeted group of people. Such affective disposition can also explain the persistence of ethnic jokes in multicultural societies. Although they can be understood by many, the conditional jokes usually don't make ridiculed individuals laugh at the punch line.\n\nThe most common type of conditional jokes, which target the jargon and all topics specific to professions and occupations, include the doctor jokes (surgeons, internists, psychiatrists, etc.), the lawyers and politicians, musicians, and the rabbi jokes among many. Other \"hermetic\" jokes which target ethnicity include Polish jokes made in the US, Irish jokes made in England, Ukrainian jokes made in Russia, Newfie jokes made in Canada, Sardarji jokes made in India, Russian jokes about ethnicities, Texas jokes, Jewish jokes made by non-Jews, the Black people jokes, and numerous others.\n\n"}

Its ultimate impact turned out to be limited due to a loophole in the legislation. The use of the word \"acquire\" meant it was considered that the act was drafted to reflect exhibition of films, not ensure production; distributors argued they had no obligation to produce movies. Some American distributors made veiled threats to remove Hollywood films from exhibition.\n\nIn 1937 the New South Wales government decided not to force distributors to participate in production.

{"id": "1089773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1089773", "title": "John Scarne", "text": "John Scarne\n\nJohn Scarne (; March 4, 1903 – July 7, 1985) was an American magician and book author who was particularly adept at playing card manipulation. He became known as an expert on cards and other games, and authored a number of popular books on cards, gambling, and related topics.\n\nHe was born Orlando Carmelo Scarnecchia in Steubenville, Ohio in the United States of America, and at some point anglicized his name to John Scarne. He grew up in the New Jersey communities of Fairview and Guttenberg. When he left school after the eighth grade, he learned from a local card sharp how to perform such swindles as The Three Card Monte, and how to cheat in gambling card games by manipulating the cards.\nScarne began practicing sleight of hand with the goal of becoming a card sharp, but his Roman Catholic mother dissuaded her son from gambling in general, and cheating others in particular. She persuaded him to practice magic instead. Scarne soon extended his skill at handling cards to learning—and devising—magical effects with cards. He spent a few months learning about crooked gambling devices (including marked cards and loaded dice) at a nearby novelty store.\nThanks to his endless practice, Scarne began making money as a magician.\n\nGradually, Scarne became quite an expert at not only magical effects, but games of all kinds as well. Articles were written about him in various magazines, and he was hired as a consultant or adviser by various companies, as well as by the US Army, which sent him to bases around the world in order to educate soldiers about the dangers of card and dice cheats. He wrote fifteen books and co-wrote a few more for a total of twenty-eight books on games, such as \"Scarne on Dice\", \"Scarne's Guide to Modern Poker\" and \"Scarne's New Complete Guide to Gambling\". He also wrote two autobiographies: \"The Amazing World of John Scarne: A Personal History\" (1956), and \"The Odds Against Me\" (1966). He served as a technical advisor in the 1973 motion picture, \"The Sting\", and doubled for actor Paul Newman's hands during scenes that involved card manipulations and deck switching.\n\nScarne was often proclaimed by experts, magicians and editors of the time as the greatest card manipulator of all time. But he was happiest when inventing (and marketing, through his company John Scarne Games, Inc.) new games, which he did quite a bit. And he was especially proud of one called Teeko, which he invented in 1945 (version withdrawn), re-invented in 1952 and modified in the 1960s. He was so proud of the game that he named his son John Teeko Scarne. Teeko quickly spread around the world. Even Orson Welles was reported to have been playing Teeko. But he never made a profit on the game mainly due to water damage in the warehouse which eliminated the entire stock in one day. Today Teeko is virtually unknown.\n\nScarne's most famous card trick was appropriately titled \"Scarne's Aces\". The trick involved taking a spectator's shuffled deck of cards, performing a series of riffle shuffles himself and then cutting to all four aces. Another one of Scarne's most notable card effects was the triple coincidence, in which a spectator and a magician each pick three different playing cards out of two regular decks of opposite colors and it is shown that all of the selections match. Scarne also created a quadruple coincidence, wherein a spectator selects a card and four impossible predictions of their card are made.\n\nScarne also attempted to discredit Edward O. Thorp's blackjack card counting system.\nIn his 1966 autobiography \"The Odds Against Me\", he claimed to analyze Thorp's system and concluded that the whole system was loaded with mathematical errors and it was pure fiction dreamed by Thorp. Scarne also went on to attempt to discredit Wilson's famous blackjack point count system. Scarne offered a challenge to blackjack card counters, but Scarne and the prospective participants were never able to agree upon the terms for the challenge.\n\nIn \"The Odds Against Me\", Scarne described his own technique for counting down up to four-deck blackjack with the rules generally used in Las Vegas in 1947: Scarne made use of his stacks of chips as a device to help track the contents of the undealt cards.\nA more complete description of his technique is present in his later book, \"Scarne's Guide to Casino Gambling\", where he also described preventative measures taken by casinos to combat card counting.\n\nScarne married Steffi Storm (née Norma Kearney) in 1955 (and they had John Teeko the same year). Scarne died on July 7, 1985 at 82, while living in North Bergen, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n"}

The king is usually the highest-ranking face card. In French playing cards and tarot decks, the king immediately outranks the queen. In Italian and Spanish playing cards, the king immediately outranks the knight. In German and Swiss playing cards, the king immediately outranks the \"Ober\". In some games, the king is the highest-ranked card; in others, the ace is higher. Aces began outranking kings around 1500 with Trappola being the earliest known game in which the aces were highest in all four suits. In the Ace-Ten family of games such as pinochle and schnapsen, both the ace and the 10 rank higher than the king.\n\nThe king card is the oldest and most universal court card. It most likely originated in Persian Ganjifeh where kings are depicted as seated on thrones and outranking the viceroy cards which are mounted on horses. Playing cards were transmitted to Italy and Spain via the Mamluks and Moors. The best preserved and most complete deck of Mamluk cards, the Topkapı pack, did not display human figures but just listed their rank most likely due to religious prohibition. It is not entirely secure if the Topkapı pack was representative of all Mamluk decks as it was a custom-made luxury item used for display. A fragment of what may be a seated king card was recovered in Egypt which may explain why the poses of court cards in Europe resemble those in Persia and India.\n\nSeated kings were generally common throughout Europe. During the 15th century, the Spanish started producing standing kings. The French originally used Spanish cards before developing their regional deck patterns. Many Spanish court designs were simply reused when the French invented their own suit-system around 1480. The English imported their cards from Rouen until the early 17th century when foreign card imports were banned. The king of hearts is sometimes called the \"suicide king\" because he appears to be sticking his sword into his head. This is a result of centuries of bad copying by English card makers where the king's axe head has disappeared.\n\nStarting in the 15th century, French manufacturers assigned to each of the court cards names taken from history or mythology. This practice survives only in the Paris pattern which ousted all its rivals, including the Rouen pattern around 1780. The names for the kings in the Paris pattern (\"portrait officiel\") are:\n\nMost French-suited continental European patterns are descended from the Paris pattern but they have dropped the names associated with each card.\n\nKings from French playing cards:\nKings from Italian playing cards:\nKings from Spanish playing cards:\nKings from German playing cards:\n"}

After being resurrected by The Hand, he works as an operative for the group. He is extremely strong, and is both a weapons master and an accomplished martial artist with an ability to use a form of meditation that allows him to recover from otherwise-mortal wounds.\n\nKirigi first appeared in \"Daredevil\" #174-176 (September-November 1981), and was created by Frank Miller.\n\nThe character subsequently appears in \"Daredevil\" #187-188 (October-November 1982).\n\nWhile it is known that the ninjas of ancient Japan feared Kirigi, little else is known of his history.\n\nKirigi is an opponent of both The Chaste, a group commanded by Stick, and two of Stick's former pupils, Daredevil and Elektra Natchios. This hatred eventually prompts the Hand to resurrect him in order to destroy Elektra. This plot eventually reaches its climax as Elektra, walking into a trap laid by the Hand, attempts to kill the Hand's Jonin (ninja master) with the assistance of Daredevil. Instead of meeting the Jonin, she meets Kirigi. In response, she stabs him with two sai; however, he merely pulls them out effortlessly. He then dupes her into going for her sai, only to choke her with his rope knife. However, she manages to impale him with her blade, forcing him to break off the fight. A day later, however, he returns to attack Elektra again after recovering from his wounds using meditation and mystic ointments. Once again, a fierce battle ensues. Elektra flees into a semi-rig and smashes into him at a high speed. She then leaps out of the semi-rig before it explodes. In spite of this, Kirigi merely stands back up, though his skin is still engulfed in flames. Finally, Elektra simply decapitates him as he tries to regain his bearings, saying: \"God or demon, Kirigi had a neck and that was human enough.\"\n\nSeveral Hand ninjas soon clash with the Chaste and Daredevil and sacrifice their lives in order to resurrect Kirigi once again, to aid them in their battle against the Chaste and Daredevil. At the moment, Daredevil has temporarily lost control of his enhanced senses and is in an isolation tank with Stick, who is trying to help him regain control of them. The newly revived Kirigi attempts to ambush Stick, but he is no match for the Chaste warriors, who collectively are able to defeat him. Stick then orders Kirigi's body destroyed to prevent him from being resurrected once again.\n\nKirigi has a seemingly superhuman resistance to pain and injury. He is capable of lifting at least 1,000 pounds. Both a weapons master and an accomplished martial artist, his various areas of expertise include the use of the Katana, Shuriken, Kyoketsu Shogi (rope knife), and sai. In addition, the use of a form of meditation allows him to recover from otherwise-mortal wounds. As a result, he is virtually impervious to all but devastating wounds.\n\n\n"}

They are notable for being the first and only burlesque troupe in the UK that performs lesbian burlesque. Following on from the success of Los Angeles-based girl band and dance troupe, the Pin Up Girls, Lesburlesque appeared on the burlesque scene in September 2010. They came to wider public attention in 2012 for having performed at a former church and continue to incorporate traditionally lesbian specific cabaret entertainment, such as drag kinging to broadening its appeal to the wider cabaret circuit.\n\nLesburlesque is a British burlesque and dance troupe, founded by lesbian cabaret performer Pixie Truffle in 2010. The troupe began as a duet burlesque routine idea, but following favourable responses from established burlesque performers Kitty Liquor, Mona Von Chrome, Isobella Lash and March Violets vocalist Rosie Garland, aka Rosie Lugosi, Pixie dedicated herself to making Lesburlesque into a fully fledged cabaret group.\n\nPerforming at a former place of worship, Platt Chapel (now Unique Manchester), Lesburlesque garnered scathing attention from the British Tabloid press. However the press in Manchester seemed supportive of their efforts to expand the concept of burlesque to the LGBTQ community and to render sapphic art forms such as drag kinging available to a larger audience.\n\nThe troupe continue to use established drag king performers The Dyke Kings and Juan Kerr. Lesburlesque and Pixie continue to spearhead the rise to equality of drag king performance art. In an exchange between Pixie and actress and feminist writer Rhona Foulis, Pixie claims it is \"...her personal mission to bring lesbian performances to a mainstream audience, in exactly the same way as drag queens have been accepted.\"\n\nThe troupe continues to be associated with the Lesbian Community Project, a charitable organisation that helps to put lesbians in touch with each other across Manchester and to provide counselling and fun activities.\n\nOn their first anniversary Pixie Truffle formed a one off partnership with Bella Besame, the founder and promoter of The Slippery Belle Presents...BURLESQUE! revue in Manchester.\n\nOn their second anniversary Pixie announced a partnership with The Singapore Burlesque Club, a well-known Burlesque revue in Singapore. Singapore is a country with stringent controls on public nudity and the Burlesque Club's stance, and association with a Lesbian Burlesque troupe, would at the very least be at odds with the state of women's rights and gay rights in its native Singapore.\n\n"}

The plot revolves around Lt. Roland Sharp, a lonesome Texas Ranger who goes undercover as an assistant coach to protect a group of college cheerleaders who have witnessed a murder. Much of the film was shot in Austin, Texas on the University of Texas campus. \n\nTexas Governor Rick Perry has a cameo appearance in the film as himself. Released on February 25, 2005, the film received negative reviews, and grossed just $21 million against a budget of $40 million.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, two lonesome Texas Rangers, Roland Sharp (Tommy Lee Jones) and Maggie Swanson (Liz Vassey), are going to a church in order to question Percy Stevens (Cedric the Entertainer) about the whereabouts of his former prison roommate, Morgan Ball, who they want to testify against organized crime boss John Cortland. Percy is indignant, telling Sharp and Swanson that he is a \"man of God\" and has not spoken with Ball in years. However, Percy's cellphone rings, displaying Ball's name.\n\nSharp and Swanson track down Ball to the warehouse, where Ball gives Sharp a key in an attempt to buy him off. Instead, Sharp takes the key and forces Ball outside, where FBI agent Eddie Zane (Brian Van Holt) is waiting. As they talk, a sniper begins shooting, wounding Swanson and giving Ball a chance to escape. It is revealed the sniper is after Ball, and a group of cheerleaders from the University of Texas at Austin witness his murder. Agent Zane is found shot in the arm next to Ball's body and claims he didn't see the sniper.\n\nAnne (Christina Milian), Teresa (Paula Garcés), Evie (Monica Keena), Heather (Vanessa Ferlito) and Barb (Kelli Garner) are taken to the police station, where they all have conflicting descriptions of the shooter. Sharp is given the task of protecting the girls at all times, because their fathers are worried about them. The information is relayed to him by the Governor of Texas (Rick Perry).\n\nIt is revealed that Sharp is divorced and has a daughter, Emma (Shannon Marie Woodward) who is in high school and doesn't feel as though her father had ever been around. John Cortland is been exonerated from all charges pressed against him due to a lack of evidence. FBI Agent Zane is revealed to be working with Cortland, having killed Ball and shot himself in the arm. \n\nCortland scolds Zane for letting some \"loose ends\" escape, and Zane begins searching for Sharp and the cheerleaders; he also kills the sniper he hired. With Swanson in the hospital recovering from her near-fatal wound, Sharp and two additional rangers must now pick the girls up from school and secure their sorority house. Sharp moves in with the girls and the two young men with him move into the fraternity house across the street, where they end up busting a drug deal.\n\nSharp sets some ground rules, including no cell phones. He also tells them to \"cover up in his presence\" (referring to the girls' revealing clothes). When they fail to comply, he orders a massive industrial air conditioner, forcing them to dress warmly. Sharp is posing as a cheerleading coach specializing in conditioning, and at a Longhorns football game he tackles an opposing team's mascot when the mascot approaches the girls with a gun, later revealed to be a water gun. Other humorous mishaps occur, but Sharp's relationship with the girls begins to strengthen; Barb even begins to develop a crush on him.\n\nHowever, Sharp finds himself attracted to Barb's English teacher Molly (Anne Archer) who calls him into her office to complain about Barb's plagiarism. Later he invites her over for dinner, which the girls coach him through using an earpiece and tiny video screen. After they fall asleep, he turns it off and woos Molly himself. He admits to the girls about his last failed marriage and the way he feels about his estranged daughter. This interests Evie, who has a 4.0 GPA and wants to write a paper on Emma. She uses the house's \"emergency phone\" to call her, revealing Sharp's location to Zane, who had contacted Emma.\n\nSharp takes the girls to a \"spirit rally\", where he is forced to give a speech about cheerleading. He becomes more and more impassioned, proving to the girls he finally \"gets it\". The night is ruined, however, when Sharp realizes in the nick of time that somebody put a bomb under their van, and Teresa (who was convinced that nobody was after them) is almost killed when her seatbelt gets stuck. Sharp saves her, and she admits that maybe someone is trying to kill them.\n\nEvie tells Sharp she contacted Emma, and when Sharp calls his daughter he learns that Zane has her. He tells Sharp to take the key Ball gave him to open a lockbox, both of them unaware the cheerleaders are listening in. The next day Sharp gets the money out of the lockbox and drives to where Zane instructs him. Zane gives Sharp instructions over a cell phone, telling him he will shoot Emma if Sharp disobeys. After Sharp handcuffs himself to the steering wheel, Zane thanks him and tells him he's a \"good parent.\" Zane takes off with the money, Sharp's keys and phone, and Emma.\n\nZane and Emma get on a bus, but as it pulls away Sharp sees Barb in the back. As he wonders what is going on, Heather gets in the car with him and picks his handcuffs. They take off after the bus in a stolen Volkswagen Beetle. On the bus, Teresa pretends to go into labor and Evie demands the bus be stopped. She attempts to steal the bag with the money, but Zane pulls a gun and Evie runs away from the bus. Zane forces all of the other passengers and the driver out, taking over driving the bus himself.\n\nEmma is rescued by the cheerleaders, but Zane attempts to drive to Mexico with the bag to hide. Sharp shoots a wheel, causing the bus to flip over 90 degrees. Zane gets out the bus, his face injured after he hits the bus's ceiling. The Mexico-United States border closes and the border officers draw guns on him, forcing him to surrender. Sharp shoots the gun out of Zane's hand, and handcuffs him with the very same cuffs Heather freed him from earlier. He and Emma are reunited. At the end of the film, Cortland is arrested and taken back to court, Sharp and Molly are married, and Emma and the cheerleaders are part of the wedding.\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 9% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 3.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A high-concept movie that plays out like a mediocre TV sitcom.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 35 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B–\" on an A+ to F scale. \n\nJames Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" panned the film, rating it one star out of four and writing: \"The movie is an \"action comedy\" in name only - there's nothing in \"Man of the House\" that could be considered funny or exciting.\" He also said the movie \"manages to neuter Cedric the Entertainer's capacity for humor\" since \"not even he is able to deliver a legitimate laugh\" and that Tommy Lee Jones \"comes across as taciturn and unlikable.\" \n\nStephen Hunter of the \"Washington Post\" called the film \"a one-screen multiplex\" with \"a lot of small movies bouncing around inside it, but there's no big movie on the outside.\" Hunter felt that by the end the \"many personalities\" of the film have \"grown tiresome\". Nonetheless, he complimented Tommy Lee Jones' \"deadpan\" portrayal, saying \"Whenever Herek doesn't know what to do -- and that's frequently -- he cuts to Jones, radiating world-weariness with the aplomb of Fred Astaire, and it's always funny.\" \n\nDana Stevens of the \"New York Times\" wrote: \"Nearly every one of the film's emotional scenes is too predictable to hit its mark, but Mr. Jones's dry delivery has its moments.\" However, Stevens found Cedric the Entertainer to be disappointing, stating that he \"fails for once to live up to his name\".\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $8,917,251 in 2,422 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #5 at the box office and averaging $3,681 per theater. The film closed on April 7, 2005, with a North American domestic gross of $19,699,706 and an international gross of $1,877,918 for a worldwide gross of $21,577,624. The film was released in the United Kingdom on April 8, 2005, and opened on #14.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14535", "title": "Music of India", "text": "Music of India\n\nThe music of India includes multiple varieties of classical music, folk music, filmi, Indian rock and Indian pop. India's classical music tradition, including Hindustani music and Carnatic, has a history spanning millennia and developed over several areas. Music in India began as an integral part of socio-religious life.\n\nThe 30,000 years old paleolithic and neolithic cave paintings at the UNESCO world heritage site at Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh shows music instruments and dance. \n\nDancing Girl sculpture (2500 BCE) was found from the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) site. There are IVC-era paintings on pottery of a man with a dhol hanging from his neck and a woman holding a drum under her left arm. \n\nVedas (c. 1500 – c. 800 BCE Vedic period) document rituals with performing arts and play. For example, Shatapatha Brahmana (~800–700 BCE) has verses in chapter 13.2 written in the form of a play between two actors. \"Tala\" or \"taal\" is an ancient music concept traceable to Vedic era texts of Hinduism, such as the \"Samaveda\" and methods for singing the Vedic hymns. Smriti (500 BCE to 100 BCE ) post-vedic Hindu texts include Valmiki's Ramayana (500 BCE to 100 BCE) which mentions dance and music (dance by Apsaras such as Urvashi, Rambha, Menaka, Tilottama Panchāpsaras, and Ravana's wives excelling in \"nrityageeta\" or \"singing and dancing\" and \"nritavaditra\" or \"playing musical instruments\"), music and singing by Gandharvas, several string instruments (vina, tantri, vipanci and \"vallaki\" similar to \"veena\"), wind instruments (shankha, venu and \"venugana\" - likely a mouth organ made by tying several flutes together), raga (including \"kaushika\" such as \"raag kaushik dhwani\"), vocal registers (seven \"svara\" or \"sur\", \"ana\" or \"ekashurti\" drag note, \"murchana\" the regulated rise and fall of voice in \"matra\" and \"tripramana\" three-fold \"teen taal\" \"laya\" such as \"drut\" or quick, \"madhya\" or middle, and \"vilambit\" or slow), poetry recitation in Bala Kanda and also in Uttara Kanda by Luv and Kusha in \"marga\" style. \nUnder the Khiljis, there were concerts and competitions between Hindustani and Carnatic musicians. Madhava Kandali, 14th century Assamese poet and writer of Saptakanda Ramayana, lists several instruments in his version of \"Ramayana\", such as mardala, khumuchi, bhemachi, dagar, gratal, ramtal, tabal, jhajhar, jinjiri, bheri mahari, tokari, dosari, kendara, dotara, vina, rudra-vipanchi, etc. (meaning that these instruments existed since his time in 14th century or earlier). The Indian system of notation is perhaps the world's oldest and most elaborate.\n\nThe two main traditions of Indian classical music are Carnatic music, which is found predominantly in the peninsular regions, and Hindustani music, which is found in the northern, eastern and central regions. The basic concepts of this music includes \"shruti\" (microtones), \"swaras\" (notes), \"alankar\" (ornamentations), \"raga\" (melodies improvised from basic grammars), and \"tala\" (rhythmic patterns used in percussion). Its tonal system divides the octave into 22 segments called Shrutis, not all equal but each roughly equal to a quarter of a whole tone of the Western music.\n\nThe tradition of Hindustani music dates back to Vedic times where the hymns in the Sama Veda, an ancient religious text, were sung as Samagana and not chanted. It diverged from Carnatic music around the 13th-14th centuries CE, primarily due to Islamic influences. Developing a strong and diverse tradition over several centuries, it has contemporary traditions established primarily in India but also in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In contrast to Carnatic music, the other main Indian classical music tradition originating from the South, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, historical Vedic philosophy and native Indian sounds but also enriched by the Persian performance practices of the Mughals. Classical genres are dhrupad, dhamar, khyal, tarana and sadra, and there are also several semi-classical forms.\n\nCarnatic music can be traced to the 14th - 15th centuries AD and thereafter. It originated in South India during the rule of Vijayanagar Empire. Like Hindustani music, it is melodic, with improvised variations, but tends to have more fixed compositions. It consists of a composition with improvised embellishments added to the piece in the forms of \"Raga Alapana\", \"Kalpanaswaram\", \"Neraval\" and, in the case of more advanced students, Raga, Tala, Pallavi. The main emphasis is on the vocals as most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in a singing style (known as \"gāyaki\"). Around 300 ragams are in use today.\nAnnamayya is the first known composer in Carnatic music. He is widely regarded as the Andhra Pada kavitā Pitāmaha (Godfather of Telugu song-writing).\nPurandara Dasa is considered the father of Carnatic music, while the later musicians Tyagaraja, Shyama Shastry and Muthuswami Dikshitar are considered the trinity of Carnatic music.\n\nNoted artists of Carnatic music include Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar (the father of the current concert format), Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, Alathur Brothers, MS Subbulakshmi, Lalgudi Jayaraman and more recently Balamuralikrishna, TN Seshagopalan, K J Yesudas, N. Ramani, Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman, Sanjay Subrahmanyan, TM Krishna, Bombay Jayashri, T S Nandakumar, Aruna Sairam, and Mysore Manjunath.\n\nEvery December, the city of Chennai in India has its eight-week-long Music Season, which is the world's largest cultural event.\n\nCarnatic music has served as the foundation for most music in South India, including folk music, festival music and has also extended its influence to film music in the past 100–150 years or so.\n\nThere are many types of music which comes under the category of light classical or semi-classical. Some of the forms are Thumri, Dadra, Ghazal, Chaiti, Kajri, Tappa, Natya Sangeet and Qawwali. These forms place emphasis on explicitly seeking emotion from the audience, as opposed to the classical forms.\n\nThis is a genre of Nepali folk song of the Tamang people and popular amongst the Nepali speaking community in West Bengal, Sikkim and around the world. It is accompanied by Tamang instruments, the Madal, Damphu and Tungna, although nowadays musicians have taken to modern instruments. A Tamang Selo can be catchy and lively or slow and melodious, and is usually sung to convey sorrow, love, happiness or day-to-day incidents and stories of folklore.\n\nHira Devi Waiba is hailed as the pioneer of Nepali folk songs and Tamang Selo. Her song 'Chura ta Hoina Astura' (चुरा त होइन अस्तुरा) is said to be the first Tamang Selo ever recorded. She has sung nearly 300 songs through her musical career spanning 40 years. After Waiba's death in 2011, her son Satya Waiba (producer) and Navneet Aditya Waiba (singer) collaborated and re-recorded her most iconic songs and released an album titled \"Ama Lai Shraddhanjali\" (आमालाई श्रद्धाञ्जली-Tribute to Mother).\n\nRabindra Sangeet ( \"Robindro Shonggit\", ), also known as Tagore songs, are songs written and composed by Rabindranath Tagore. They have distinctive characteristics in the music of Bengal, popular in India and Bangladesh. \"Sangeet\" means music, \"Rabindra Sangeet\" means music (or more aptly songs) of Rabindra.\nTagore wrote some 2,230 songs in Bengali, now known as \"Rabindra Sangeet\", using classical music and traditional folk music as sources.\n\nBihu () is the festival of New Year of Assam falling on mid-April. This is a festival of nature and mother earth where the first day is for the cows and buffaloes. The second day of the festival is for the man. Bihu dances and songs accompanied by traditional drums and wind instruments are an essential part of this festival. Bihu songs are energetic and with beats to welcome the festive spring. Assamese drums (dhol), Pepa(usually made from buffalo horn), Gogona are major instruments used. \n\nSufi folk rock contains elements of modern hard rock and traditional folk music with Sufi poetry. While it was pioneered by bands like Junoon in Pakistan it became very popular, especially in north India. In 2005, Rabbi Shergill released a Sufi rock song called \"Bulla Ki Jaana\", which became a chart-topper in India and Pakistan. More recently, the sufi folk rock song \"Bulleya\" from the 2016 film \"Ae Dil Hai Mushkil\" became a mammoth hit.\n\nDandiya or Raas is a form of Gujarati cultural dance that is performed with sticks. The present musical style is derived from the traditional musical accompaniment to the folk dance. It is practiced mainly in the state of Gujarat. There is also another type of dance and music associated with Dandiya/Raas called Garba.\n\nUttarakhandi folk music had its root in the lap of nature and the hilly terrain of the region. Common themes in the folk music of Uttarakhand are the beauty of nature, various seasons, festivals, religious traditions, cultural practices, folk stories, historical characters, and the bravery of ancestors. The folk songs of Uttarakhand are a reflection of the cultural heritage and the way people live their lives in the Himalayas. Musical instruments used in Uttarakhand music include the Dhol, Damoun, Turri, Ransingha, Dholki, Daur, Thali, Bhankora and Masakbhaja. Tabla and Harmonium are also sometimes used, especially in recorded folk music from the 1960s onwards. Generic Indian and global musical instruments have been incorporated in modern popular folks by singers like Narendra Singh Negi, Mohan Upreti, Gopal Babu Goswami, and Chandra Singh Rahi.\n\nLavani comes from the word \"Lavanya\" which means \"beauty\". This is one of the most popular forms of dance and music that is practiced all over Maharashtra. It has, in fact, become a necessary part of the Maharashtrian folk dance performances. Traditionally, the songs are sung by female artists, but male artists may occasionally sing Lavanis. The dance format associated with Lavani is known as Tamasha. Lavani is a combination of traditional song and dance, which particularly performed to the enchanting beats of 'Dholaki', a drum-like instrument. The dance is performed by attractive women wearing nine-yard saris. They are sung in a quick tempo. Lavani originated in the arid region of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.\n\nRajasthan has a very diverse cultural collection of musician castes, including Langas, Sapera, Bhopa, Jogi and Manganiyar (lit. \"the ones who ask/beg\"). \"Rajasthan Diary\" quotes it as a soulful, full-throated music with harmonious diversity. The melodies of Rajasthan come from a variety of instruments. The stringed variety includes the Sarangi, Ravanahatha, Kamayacha, Morsing and Ektara. Percussion instruments come in all shapes and sizes from the huge Nagaras and Dhols to the tiny Damrus. The Daf and Chang are a favorite of Holi (the festival of colours) revelers. Flutes and bagpipers come in local flavors such as Shehnai, Poongi, Algoza, Tarpi, Been and Bankia.\n\nRajasthani music is derived from a combination of string instruments, percussion instruments and wind instruments accompanied by renditions of folk singers. It enjoys a respectable presence in Bollywood music as well.\n\nThe biggest form of Indian popular music is filmi, or songs from Indian films, it makes up 72% of the music sales in India. The film industry of India supported music by according reverence to classical music while utilising the western orchestration to support Indian melodies. Music composers, like R. D. Burman, Shankar Jaikishan, S. D. Burman, Madan Mohan, Bhupen Hazarika, Naushad Ali, O. P. Nayyar, Hemant Kumar, C. Ramchandra, Salil Chowdhury, Kalyanji Anandji, Ilaiyaraaja, A. R. Rahman, Jatin Lalit, Anu Malik, Nadeem-Shravan, Harris Jayaraj, Himesh Reshammiya, Vidyasagar, Shankar Ehsaan Loy, Salim-Sulaiman, Pritam, M.S. Viswanathan, K. V. Mahadevan, Ghantasala and S. D. Batish employed the principles of harmony while retaining classical and folk flavor. Reputed names in the domain of Indian classical music like Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan, Ali Akbar Khan and Ram Narayan have also composed music for films. Traditionally, in Indian films, the voice for the songs is not provided by the actors, they are provided by the professional playback singers, to sound more developed, melodious and soulful, while actors lipsynch on the screen. In the past, only a handful of singers provided the voice in Hindi films. These include Kishore Kumar,K. J. Yesudas, Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh, S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, T.M. Soundararajan, Hemant Kumar, Manna Dey, P. Susheela, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhonsle, K.S. Chitra, Geeta Dutt, S. Janaki, Shamshad Begum, Suraiya, Noorjahan and Suman Kalyanpur. Recent playback singers include Udit Narayan, Kumar Sanu, Kailash Kher, Alisha Chinai, KK, Shaan, Madhushree, Shreya Ghoshal, Nihira Joshi, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Hariharan (singer), Ilaiyaraaja, A.R. Rahman, Sonu Nigam, Sukhwinder Singh, Kunal Ganjawala, Anu Malik, Sunidhi Chauhan, Anushka Manchanda, Raja Hasan, Arijit Singh and Alka Yagnik. Rock bands like Indus Creed, Indian Ocean, Silk Route and Euphoria have gained mass appeal with the advent of cable music television.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, rock and roll fusions with Indian music were well known throughout Europe and North America. Ali Akbar Khan's 1955 performance in the United States was perhaps the beginning of this trend.\n\nJazz pioneers such as John Coltrane—who recorded a composition entitled 'India' during the November 1961 sessions for his album \"Live At The Village Vanguard\" (the track was not released until 1963 on Coltrane's album \"Impressions\")—also embraced this fusion. George Harrison (of the Beatles) played the sitar on the song \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" in 1965, which sparked interest from Shankar, who subsequently took Harrison as his apprentice. Jazz innovator Miles Davis recorded and performed with musicians like Khalil Balakrishna, Bihari Sharma, and Badal Roy in his post-1968 electric ensembles. Virtuoso jazz guitarist John McLaughlin spent several years in Madurai learning Carnatic music and incorporated it into many of his acts including Shakti which featured prominent Indian musicians. Other Western artists such as the Grateful Dead, Incredible String Band, the Rolling Stones, the Move and Traffic soon incorporated Indian influences and instruments, and added Indian performers.\nLegendary Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia joined guitarist Sanjay Mishra on his classic CD \"Blue Incantation\" (1995). Mishra also wrote an original score for French Director Eric Heumann for his film \"Port Djema\" (1996) which won best score at Hamptons film festival and The Golden Bear at Berlin. in 2000 he recorded \"Rescue\" with drummer Dennis Chambers (Carlos Santana, John McLaughlin et al.) and in 2006 Chateau Benares with guests DJ Logic and Keller Williams (guitar and bass).\n\nThough the Indian music craze soon died down among mainstream audiences, die-hard fans and immigrants continued the fusion. In 1985, a beat-oriented, Raga Rock hybrid called Sitar Power by Ashwin Batish reintroduced sitar in western nations. Sitar Power drew the attention of a number of record labels and was snapped up by Shanachie Records of New Jersey to head their World Beat Ethno Pop division.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Indian-British artists fused Indian and Western traditions to make the Asian Underground. Since the 1990s, Canadian born musician Nadaka who has spent most of his life in India, has been creating music that is an acoustic fusion of Indian classical music with western styles. One such singer who has merged the Bhakti sangeet tradition of India with the western non-Indian music is Krishna Das and sells music records of his musical sadhana. Another example is the Indo-Canadian musician Vandana Vishwas who has experimented with western music in her 2013 album \"Monologues\".\n\nIn the new millennium, American hip-hop has featured Indian filmi and bhangra. Mainstream hip-hop artists have sampled songs from Bollywood movies and have collaborated with Indian artists. Examples include Timbaland's \"Indian Flute\", Erick Sermon and Redman's \"React\", Slum Village's \"Disco\", and Truth Hurts' hit song \"Addictive\", which sampled a Lata Mangeshkar song, and The Black Eyed Peas sampled Asha Bhosle's song \"Yeh Mera Dil\" in their hit single \"Don't Phunk With My Heart\". In 1997, the British band Cornershop paid tribute to Asha Bhosle with their song \"Brimful of Asha\", which became an international hit. British-born Indian artist Panjabi MC also had a Bhangra hit in the U.S. with \"Mundian To Bach Ke\" which featured rapper Jay-Z. Asian Dub Foundation are not huge mainstream stars, but their politically charged rap and punk rock influenced sound has a multi-racial audience in their native UK. In 2008, international star Snoop Dogg appeared in a song in the film Singh Is Kinng. In 2007, hip-hop producer Madlib released ; an album which heavily samples and is inspired by the music of India.\n\nSometimes, the music of India will fuse with the traditional music of other countries. For example, Delhi 2 Dublin, a band based in Canada, is known for fusing Indian and Irish music, and Bhangraton is a fusion of Bhangra music with reggaeton, which itself is a fusion of hip hop, reggae, and traditional Latin American music.\n\nIn a more recent example of Indian-British fusion, Laura Marling along with Mumford and Sons collaborated in 2010 with the Dharohar Project on a four-song EP. The British band Bombay Bicycle Club also sampled the song \"Man Dole Mera Tan Dole\" for their single \"Feel\".\n\nIndian pop music is based on an amalgamation of Indian folk and classical music, and modern beats from different parts of the world. Pop music really started in the South Asian region with the playback singer Ahmed Rushdi's song ‘\"Ko Ko Korina\"’ in 1966, followed initially by Mohammad Rafi in the late 1960s and then by Kishore Kumar in the early 1970s.\n\nAfter that, much of Indian Pop music comes from the Indian Film Industry, and until the 1990s, few singers like Usha Uthup, Sharon Prabhakar, and Peenaz Masani outside it were popular. Since then, pop singers in the latter group have included Daler Mehndi, Baba Sehgal, Alisha Chinai, KK, Shantanu Mukherjee a.k.a. Shaan, Sagarika, Colonial Cousins (Hariharan, Lesle Lewis), Lucky Ali, and Sonu Nigam, and music composers like Zila Khan or Jawahar Wattal, who made top selling albums with, Daler Mehndi, Shubha Mudgal, Baba Sehgal, Shweta Shetty and Hans Raj Hans.\n\nBesides those listed above, popular Indi-pop singers include Sanam (Band), Gurdas Maan, Sukhwinder Singh, Papon, Zubeen Garg, Raghav Sachar Rageshwari, Vandana Vishwas, Devika Chawla, Bombay Vikings, Asha Bhosle, Sunidhi Chauhan, Anushka Manchanda, Bombay Rockers, Anu Malik, Jazzy B, Malkit Singh, Raghav, Jay Sean, Juggy D, Rishi Rich, Sheila Chandra, Bally Sagoo, Punjabi MC, Bhangra Knights, Mehnaz, Sanober and Vaishali Samant.\n\nRecently, Indian pop has taken an interesting turn with the \"remixing\" of songs from past Indian movie songs, new beats being added to them.\n\nRaga rock is rock or pop music with a heavy Indian influence, either in its construction, its timbre, or its use of instrumentation, such as the sitar and tabla. Raga and other forms of classical Indian music began to influence many rock groups during the 1960s; most famously the Beatles. The first traces of \"raga rock\" can be heard on songs such as \"See My Friends\" by the Kinks and the Yardbirds' \"Heart Full of Soul\", released the previous month, featured a sitar-like riff by guitarist Jeff Beck. The Beatles song \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\", which first appeared on the band's 1965 album Rubber Soul, was the first western pop song to actually incorporate the sitar (played by lead guitarist George Harrison). The Byrds' March 1966 single \"Eight Miles High\" and its B-side \"Why\" were also influential in originating the musical subgenre. Indeed, the term \"raga rock\" was coined by The Byrds' publicist in the press releases for the single and was first used in print by journalist Sally Kempton in her review of \"Eight Miles High\" for The Village Voice. George Harrison's interest in Indian music, popularised the genre in the mid-1960s with songs such as \"Love You To\", \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" (credited to Lennon-McCartney), \"Within You Without You\" and \"The Inner Light\". The rock acts of the sixties both in turn influenced British and American groups and Indian acts to develop a later form of Indian rock.\n\nThe rock music \"scene\" in India is small compared to the filmi or fusion musicality \"scenes\" but as of recent years has come into its own, achieving a cult status of sorts. Rock music in India has its origins in the 1960s when international stars such as the Beatles visited India and brought their music with them. These artists' collaboration with Indian musicians such as Ravi Shankar and Zakir Hussain have led to the development of raga rock. International shortwave radio stations such as The Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Ceylon played a major part in bringing Western pop, folk, and rock music to the masses. Indian rock bands began to gain prominence only much later, around the late 1980s.\n\nIt was around this time that the rock band Indus Creed formerly known as The Rock Machine got itself noticed on the international stage with hits like \"Rock N Roll Renegade\". Other bands quickly followed. As of now, the rock music scene in India is quietly growing day by day and gathering more support. With the introduction of MTV in the early 1990s, Indians began to be exposed to various forms of rock such as grunge and speed metal. This influence can be clearly seen in many Indian bands today. The cities of the North Eastern Region, mainly Guwahati and Shillong, Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore have emerged as major melting pots for rock and metal enthusiasts. Bangalore has been the hub for rock and metal movement in India. Some prominent bands include Nicotine, Voodoo Child, Indian Ocean, Kryptos, Thermal and a Quarter, Demonic Resurrection, Motherjane, Avial, and Parikrama. The future looks encouraging thanks to entities such as DogmaTone Records and Eastern Fare Music Foundation that are dedicated to promoting and supporting Indian rock.\n\nFrom Central India, Nicotine, an Indore-based metal band, is widely credited of being the pioneer of metal music in the region.\n\nThe spread and following of Western classical music in India is almost entirely non-existent. It is mainly patronised by the Indian Zoroastrian community and small esoteric groups with historical exposure to Western classical music. Another esoteric group with significant patronage is the Protestant Christian community in Chennai and Bangalore. Western Music education is also severely neglected and pretty rare in India. Western keyboard, drums and guitar instruction being an exception as it has found some interest; mainly in an effort to create musicians to service contemporary popular Indian music. Many reasons have been cited for the obscurity of Western classical music in India, a country rich in its musical heritage by its own right, however, the two main reasons are an utter lack of exposure and a passive disinterest in what is considered esoteric at best. The difficulty in importing Western musical instruments and their rarity have also contributed to the obscurity of classical Western music.\n\nDespite more than a century of exposure to Western classical music and two centuries of British colonialism, classical music in India has never gained more than 'fringe' popularity. Many attempts to popularise Western classical music in India have failed in the past due to disinterest and lack of sustained efforts. Today, Western classical music education has improved with the help of numerous institutions in India. Institutions like KM Music Conservatory (founded by Oscar-winning Composer A.R.Rahman), Calcutta School of Music, Eastern Fare Music Foundation, Delhi School of Music, Delhi Music Academy, Guitarmonk and many others are dedicated to contributing to the progress or growth and supporting Western classical music. In 1930, Mehli Mehta set up the Bombay Symphony Orchestra. \n\nThe Bombay Chamber Orchestra (BCO) was founded in 1962.\n\nIn 2006, the Symphony Orchestra of India was founded, housed at the NCPA in Mumbai. It is today the only professional symphony orchestra in India and presents two concert seasons per year, with world-renowned conductors and soloists.\n\nSome prominent Indians in Western classical music are:\n\n\nPatriotic feelings have been instigated within Indians through music since the era of the freedom struggle. Jana Gana Mana, the national anthem of India by Rabindranath Tagore, is largely credited for uniting India through music and Vande Mataram by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay as the national song of India. Patriotic songs were also written in many regional languages such as \"Biswo Bizoyi No Zuwan \" in Assamese. Post-independence songs such as Aye mere watan ke logo, Mile Sur Mera Tumhara, Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo, Maa Tujhe Salaam by A.R.Rahman have been responsible for consolidating feelings of national integration and unity in diversity.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "749190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=749190", "title": "Rikishi", "text": "Rikishi\n\nA rikishi (力士) sumotori or, more colloquially, sumosan, is a professional sumo wrestler. \"Rikishi\" are expected to live according to centuries-old rules and, although there are some exceptions, most come from Japan, where sumo is practiced exclusively. Participation in official tournaments is the only means of marking achievement in sumo and the rank of an individual \"rikishi\" is based solely on official wins. \n\nIn popular use, the term \"rikishi\" can mean any sumo wrestler and an alternative term to \"sumotori\" (sumo practitioner) or the more colloquial \"sumosan\". The two kanji characters that make up the word \"rikishi\" are \"strength/power\" and \"gentleman/samurai\"; consequently, and more idiomatically, the term can be defined as \"a gentleman of strength\".\n\nWithin the world of sumo, \"rikishi\" is used as a catch-all term for wrestlers who are in the lower, un-salaried divisions of \"jonokuchi\", \"jonidan\", \"sandanme\" and \"makushita\". The more prestigious term \"sekitori\" refers to wrestlers who have risen to the two highest divisions of \"jūryō\" and \"makuuchi\" and who have significantly more status, privilege and salary than their lower-division counterparts, as enumerated here. For details about the differences in competition between divisions see Professional sumo divisions.\n\nThe life of a sumo wrestler is strictly regimented and has detailed prescriptions and rules for \"rikishi\" that have been observed for centuries, so much so that \"rikishi\" can be seen more as a way of life than a career.\n\nThey are expected to grow their hair long to form a topknot or \"chonmage\", similar to the samurai hairstyles of the Edo Period. Furthermore, they are expected to wear the \"chonmage\" and traditional Japanese dress at all times when in public. Sumo life centers around the training stables to which all active wrestlers belong. In addition, most wrestlers, and all junior ones, live in their stable in a dormitory style: training, cleaning, eating, sleeping and socializing together. For more details, see Life as a professional sumo wrestler.\n\nProfessional sumo is practiced exclusively in Japan, but wrestlers of other nationalities participate. As of August 2009 there were 55 wrestlers officially listed as foreigners. In July 2007, there were 19 foreigners in the top two divisions, which was an all-time record, and for the first time a majority of wrestlers in the top \"san'yaku\" ranks were from overseas. More recently, the ratio of foreigners has stabilized and as of November 2011 there were 18 foreigners in the two top divisions.\n\nA Japanese-American, Toyonishiki, and the Korean-born Rikidōzan achieved \"sekitori\" status prior to World War II, but neither were officially listed as foreigners. The first non-Asian to achieve fame and fortune in sumo was Hawaii-born Takamiyama. He reached the top division in 1968 and in 1972 became the first foreigner to win the top division championship. He was followed by a fellow Hawaii-born 287 kg (660 pound) mega-weight, Konishiki of ethnic Samoan descent, the first foreigner to reach the rank of \"ōzeki\" in 1987; and the native Hawaiian Akebono, who became the first foreign-born \"yokozuna\" in 1993. Musashimaru, born in Samoa but from Hawaii, became the second foreigner to reach sumo's top rank in 1999. Four straight \"yokozuna\", retired Asashōryū and Harumafuji Kōhei, and still active Hakuhō and Kakuryū Rikisaburō are all Mongolian. In 2012, the Mongolian Kyokutenhō became the oldest wrestler in modern history to win a top division championship. Wrestlers from Eastern European countries such as Georgia and Russia have also found success in the upper levels of sumo. In 2005, Kotoōshū from Bulgaria became the first wrestler of European birth to attain the \"ōzeki\" ranking and the first to win a top division championship. In another milestone, Brazilian Ryūkō Gō became the first foreign born wrestler to be given \"makushita tsukedashi\" status.\n\nUntil relatively recently, the Japan Sumo Association had no restrictions at all on the number of foreigners allowed in professional sumo. In May 1992, shortly after the Ōshima stable had recruited six Mongolians at the same time, the Sumo Association's new director Dewanoumi, the former \"yokozuna\" Sadanoyama, announced that he was considering limiting the number of overseas recruits per stable and in sumo overall. There was no official ruling, but no stable recruited any foreigners for the next six years. This unofficial ban was then relaxed, but only two new foreigners per stable were allowed, until the total number reached 40. Then in 2002, a one foreigner per stable policy was officially adopted, though the ban was not retroactive, so foreigners recruited before the changes were unaffected. Though the move has been met with criticism, there are no plans to relax the restrictions at this time. Originally, it was possible for a place in a stable to open up if a foreign born wrestler acquired Japanese citizenship. This occurred when Hisanoumi changed his nationality from Tongan at the end of 2006, allowing another Tongan to enter his stable, and Kyokutenhō's change of citizenship allowed Ōshima stable to recruit Mongolian Kyokushūhō in May 2007. However, on February 23, 2010 the Sumo Association announced that it had changed its definition of \"foreign\" to \"foreign-born\" (\"gaikoku shusshin\"), meaning that even naturalized Japanese citizens will be considered as foreigners if they were born outside Japan. The restriction on one foreign wrestler per stable was also reconfirmed. As Japanese law does not recognize subcategories of Japanese citizen, this unique treatment of naturalized citizens may well be illegal under Japanese law, although the restriction has never been challenged in court.\n\nWhile sumo is considered a martial art, it diverges from the typical Eastern style both at the surface and at its heart. Whereas most martial arts award promotions to practitioners through time and practice, a \"rikishi\"'s sumo rank can be gained and lost every two months in the official tournaments. Conversely, in more common Japanese martial arts (such as karate), ranks are gained after passing a single test, and practitioners of karate are not normally demoted, even after repeated poor performances at tournaments. This divergence from other martial arts creates a high-pressure, high-intensity environment for \"rikishi\". All the benefits that \"sekitori\" wrestlers receive can be taken from them if they fail to maintain a high level of achievement in each official tournament (or \"honbasho\").\n\nFurthermore, sumo does not provide any means of achievement besides the official tournaments. A \"rikishi\"'s rank is determined \"solely\" by his number of wins during an official tournament. On the other hand, in many other Eastern martial arts, competitors can display their skill by performing standard routines, called \"kata\" or forms, to receive recognition. Thus, sumo wrestlers are very specialized fighters who train to win their bouts using good technique, as this is their only means of gaining better privileges in their stables and higher salaries.\n\nThe numerous differences between sumo and its martial arts counterparts have not deterred many former sumo wrestlers from competing in mixed martial arts. Most have had limited achievement; perhaps the most successful sumo wrestler to have competed in MMA is Tadao Yasuda who holds a record of two wins and four losses. Sumo wrestlers are seen as generally ineffective in MMA because the sports are vastly different from one another in achieving victory; striking techniques and submissions are required for MMA and neither are taught in sumo wrestling. A few key sumo techniques which require grabbing the belt or pants of the opponent also become ineffective, as this is illegal in MMA.\n\nOther sumo wrestlers to have fought in mixed martial arts include Alan Karaev, Kōji Kitao, Henry Armstrong Miller, Akebono Tarō, Teila Tuli and Wakashoyo. Former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Lyoto Machida also has a sumo background but his main style is Shotokan Karate.\n\n"}

(The SCDS didn't become the RSCDS until 1951.)\n\nThe RSCDS collected dances from living memory as well as from old (17-19c.) manuscripts and republished them in a series of books. Most of these dances needed some interpretation, and the dance style itself underwent serious standardisation, becoming much more balletic instead of the easy-going style that was the norm in the early 20th century, and which the RSCDS's founders considered sloppy and untraditional. After some argument, in the late 1940s the RSCDS also started publishing newly devised dances.\n\nToday the RSCDS numbers some 11.000 members all over the world, served from the headquarters in Edinburgh, and the continuous well-being of the Scottish country dance scene is largely due to the efforts of the Society. The RSCDS offers teacher training and holds an annual summer school in St Andrews, Fife for four weeks in July and August. In addition to the annual summer school, the RSCDS offers a winter school in February and a youth orientated Spring Fling in April, which is held in the UK and Europe respectively. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "771651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=771651", "title": "Scream of the Shalka", "text": "Scream of the Shalka\n\nScream of the Shalka is a Flash-animated series based on the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". It was produced to coincide with the 40th Anniversary of the series and was originally posted in six weekly parts from 13 November to 18 December 2003 on bbc.co.uk's \"Doctor Who\" website.\n\nAlthough \"Scream of the Shalka\" continues the narrative of the original 1963–89 programme and the 1996 television film, the show's 2005 revival ignored its events. The series was scripted by veteran \"Doctor Who\" writer Paul Cornell, with Richard E. Grant providing the voice for the Ninth Doctor. This performance followed years of rumours that Grant would play the Doctor in a film or new series, and indeed he had appeared as the \"Conceited Doctor\" in the Comic Relief special \"Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death\" in 1999. Grant subsequently went on to appear in the revived television series of \"Doctor Who\" as a guest villain in 2012's \"The Snowmen\" and 2013's \"The Bells of Saint John\" and \"The Name of the Doctor\". The Doctor's companion for this adventure, Alison Cheney, was voiced by Sophie Okonedo who a year later would be nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in \"Hotel Rwanda\". She also appeared in the 2010 series of \"Doctor Who\", as Liz 10, in the episodes \"The Beast Below\" and \"The Pandorica Opens\". Derek Jacobi reprised his role as the Master in 2007's \"Utopia\". David Tennant appeared in a cameo role as the Caretaker, later being cast as the Tenth Doctor in 2005.\n\nPrevious \"Doctor Who\" webcasts had limited animation and were little more than a series of illustrations. Earlier in 2003, BBCi had had some success with the original animated webcast \"Ghosts of Albion\". The animation for that story was provided by Manchester-based animation studio Cosgrove Hall, who were also hired to animate the missing episodes of Second Doctor serial \"The Invasion\" for its home release.\n\nThis story was the first officially licensed, fully animated \"Doctor Who\" story.\n\nThe TARDIS materializes in the village of Lannet in Lancashire. An annoyed Doctor, who has apparently been transported here against his will, is locked out of the TARDIS and forced to examine his surroundings. After determining he is in England in 2003, he is surprised to discover the village is silent and the inhabitants all living in fear except for a barmaid named Alison Cheney. After the patrons and bar owner refuse to tell the Doctor what's going on, he leaves the bar and stumbles upon a lava statue and a homeless woman who is frightened. As the woman is beginning to fill in the Doctor on what's been happening, a tremor strikes the area and the woman is killed by a mysterious force. Back at the TARDIS, the ground opens up and the Doctor's police box is swallowed up into the lava below. Angered at the homeless woman's death, the Doctor tracks down Alison and her boyfriend Joe at their home and breaks in demanding that someone tell him what's been going on. Alison tells the Doctor that three weeks ago, strange noises began coming from underground. She has seen mysterious aliens around town watching her. The townspeople have convinced themselves that they need to stay indoors and make as little noise as possible. The Doctor begins making noise to attract the aliens, who burst up through the floor in a pool of lava. Immune to their shrieking cries, he deflects their noises back at them causing them to explode. The Doctor, Alison, and Joe flee next door where the Doctor explains that the aliens have bodies that can remake themselves. He improvises a large explosion which he believes will disable them and buy time. The explosion destroys the two alien worms and causes the noises from the ground to stop.\n\nThe Doctor contacts UNIT and explains that he is not interested in getting involved in this problem. He gives them all the information he has on the aliens and tells them that once he retrieves his TARDIS he is leaving. The aliens have begun nesting below ground at a site rich with a special volcanic rock the Doctor believes they have adapted themselves to use. He maps out the area and leads a UNIT team down into some caves to find his TARDIS. After a tense exchange with the UNIT commander, the worm creatures attack and the Doctor separates himself from the group and hitches a ride in a giant underground worm to the main lair of the aliens. There he meets Prime, commander of the Shalka. Prime declares humans inferior and subject to their domination. The Doctor attempts to act inept to extract information from Prime, who sees through the act and calls him out on it. Prime reveals that the Shalka are 2000 strong and will be invading the surface soon. The Doctor attempts another bluff, declaring himself a non-human and therefore uninterested in what happens to the humans. Prime orders Alison executed in hot lava, which forces the Doctor to make a deal to spare her life. He allows the Shalka into the TARDIS and de-activates the Master, who turns out to be an android programmed by the Doctor. The Shalka tell the Doctor his technology is inferior and they do not need him. He is cast into a black hole they have created inside Earth that they are using as a gateway to bring in more troops and also to dispose of people they do not need. As he is plummeting into the black hole the Doctor realizes his phone is still connected to the TARDIS and uses it to summon the TARDIS. He finds the Master re-activated and forcefully expels the Shalka from the TARDIS into the black hole. For an unknown reason, the Shalka release Alison back to the surface.\n\nAs UNIT evacuates the town, a soldier tells the Doctor he has captured one of the Shalka on the surface. The Shalka was accidentally exposed to raw oxygen when a cylinder near it exploded. The raw oxygen caused it to pass out. The Doctor also discovers that Alison is alive, and that none of the survivors from the town have made it to their new destinations. The Doctor attempts to interrogate the Shalka but it recovers and attacks the soldier. The Doctor uses more oxygen to subdue it until he can determine what's going on. He also discovers that the survivors all have sore throats. The survivors and Alison all march against their will to a warehouse in another town. The Doctor arrives in his TARDIS with UNIT men inside and they storm the area. The Doctor removes a living Shalka from Alison's forehead but the effort causes him to pass out. When he recovers they find that all around the world people are mobilizing against their will to strategic points on Earth. The Doctor realizes that the reason everyone has a sore throat is that they all have been emitting subsonic screams when under Shalka control. The Shalka are using the screams to alter the atmosphere of the Earth. As the slaves begin emitting their screams and the ozone layer of the Earth is being stripped away the Doctor takes Alison and the Master back to the Shalka underground lair. When asked if the Master is coming with them, the Doctor tells Alison that the Master cannot leave the TARDIS. The Doctor and Alison confront Prime, who tells them that the Shalka inhabit 80% of the worlds in the universe, living underground off of volcanic energy. When a species is on the edge of ecological destruction, the Shalka come in and finish destroying the planet. The rest of the universe assumes that the species that died off did the damage to themselves, and the Shalka live underground in the remains of that world.\n\nThe Doctor swallows the small piece of Shalka he removed from Alison's forehead. He bonds with it, reprogramming it to do what he wants. He uses its knowledge to plug himself into their sonic network and understand the shrieks. He engages Prime in a \"sonic duel\", which he purposely throws to get Prime to move him toward the black hole controls. He activates the black hole, sucking in Prime and sending her to her death. Alison stops the black hole and the Doctor coughs up the piece of Shalka. He puts it back in Alison's head, where she fights off the remaining Shalka and shuts down the screams. The Doctor unplugs her a few moments before she can reprogram the scream to heal the atmosphere. He tells her that she cannot be allowed that much power. On board the TARDIS, the Master reveals that it has been a long time since the Doctor had a living companion. His last companion was killed in the events that also led to the Master choosing to have his consciousness placed in the android and to the Doctor's exile. Without being specific, the Master tells her that they are being controlled by an unknown force and the Doctor wants Alison to stay as his companion but he won't ask her to. After they land, Joe arrives and Alison tells him she is leaving with the Doctor because she is bored and wants to see the universe. Joe reluctantly accepts her decision and a kiss before the Master begins the TARDIS dematerializing cycle and they board the craft.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" had suspended production in 1989, and aside from charity specials had only resurfaced as an American-funded television movie in 1996, which did not garner enough ratings to go to a regular series. When \"Shalka\" was announced in July 2003 for planned broadcast in November, the possibility of \"Doctor Who\" returning to television screens still seemed remote and BBC Worldwide were continuing to shop around for another possible movie deal. As a result, BBCi officially announced, with BBC approval, that the Doctor appearing in \"Shalka\" would be the Ninth Doctor. However, events rapidly overtook this.\n\nIn September Lorraine Heggessey, the Controller of BBC One, managed to persuade BBC Worldwide that as their plans for a \"Doctor Who\" film were nowhere near fruition, BBC television should be allowed to make a new series. A deal with Russell T Davies to produce the new series was quickly struck, and on 26 September, the BBC announced that \"Doctor Who\" would be returning to BBC One in 2005, produced by BBC Wales. As a result, the status of the \"Shalka\" webcast was in doubt from even before it was released.\n\nAfter the webcast, in February 2004, plans for sequels were indefinitely shelved. For a period, it was unclear if the new television Doctor would be the Ninth or Tenth Doctor, but this was ultimately settled in April 2004 when in an interview with \"Doctor Who Magazine\", Davies announced that the new television Doctor (played by Christopher Eccleston), would be the Ninth Doctor, relegating Grant's Doctor to an alternate Doctor. Davies later commented that Grant had never been considered for the role in the television series, telling \"Doctor Who Magazine\": \"I thought he was terrible. I thought he took the money and ran, to be honest. It was a lazy performance. He was never on our list to play the Doctor.\"\n\nThe working title for this production was \"Servants of the Shalakor\". This original story outline is included in the BBC Books novelization (see below).\n\nThe novelization of \"Shalka\" was written by Paul Cornell. The book also includes a feature on the making of the webcast, as well as the original \"Servants of the Shalakor\" story outline.\n\nObverse Books published \"The Black Archive #10: Scream of the Shalka\" by Jon Arnold in March 2017, detailing the story's key points and the production process, featuring an in depth look at the unmade sequel story \"Blood of the Robots\". This book also revealed that the Big Finish audio drama \"Immortal Beloved\" was originally intended as a Shalka sequel before being adapted to feature the Eighth Doctor.\n\nThe British Board of Film Classification cleared all six episodes of the series for release on DVD. In March 2007, clips from the series were released to DVD, as part of \"Flash Frames\", a documentary on the DVD release of the restored \"The Invasion\". The story was released on DVD in Region 2 on 16 September 2013.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was directed by Anthony C. Ferrante, with Ian Ziering and Tara Reid reprising their roles from the first film. The film premiered on July 30, 2014, and was the highest-premiering film on the Syfy Channel.\n\nFin Shepard, and his ex-wife, April Wexler, are traveling to New York City to promote \"How to Survive a Sharknado and Other Unnatural Disasters\", a book April has written about the Los Angeles sharknado. As the plane comes in for a landing through a storm, it is battered by airborne sharks, losing an engine. Sharks enter the plane, killing passengers and the crew, including both pilots. While Fin lands the plane, April's hand is severed while she attempts to shoot a shark with an air marshal's handgun.\n\nFin's sister, Ellen Brody, is sightseeing in New York with her family. Her husband, Martin, a childhood friend of Fin's, takes their son, Vaughn, to a Mets game at Citi Field along with Martin's and Fin's friends Skye and Brian. Ellen takes their daughter, Mora, to the Statue of Liberty, where she meets with her friends, Polly and Chrissie, who tell her about Fin's recent appearance.\n\nAt the airport, Fin tries to warn the crowd of the impending storm, only for no one to take him seriously. After leaving April to the hospital for surgery, Fin is able to contact Ellen, and tells her to get to the Bales Tower Hotel on Manhattan as soon as possible. He agrees to retrieve Martin and Vaughn from the ball game, hiring a cabbie, Ben, in the process. At Citi Field, Skye surprises Fin with a kiss, but Fin explains that he and April are back together. The game is cancelled because of the storm, but when sharks start falling from the sky and killing people, Fin and his group improvise weapons to fight them and go to the subway.\n\nOn the ferry ride back to Manhattan, a shark kills Chrissie. The remaining three women flee from the severed head of the Statue of Liberty. Meanwhile, the subway tunnels flood, sending sharks to break into the train's rear cabin and kill Brian. Ben, who anticipated Fin's escape, takes Fin and the others to shops in search of weapons and items to make explosives. When the taxi is caught in a flood, Fin forms a rope swing to take Skye, Vaughn, and Martin to safety. When Ben is killed in his attempt and the rope falls away, Fin uses the top of the sharks as stepping stones to reach the others.\n\nTwo sharknadoes are converging into a more powerful storm directly above the hotel. Fin and Skye head to the roof to try to bomb the sharknadoes. Polly is flattened by a whale shark, but Ellen and Mora reach the hotel, and reunite with Martin and Vaughn. Fin and Skye sling bombs into the tornadoes, but as the storm system is too cold; only a few sharks are knocked down, and they are forced to flee down a fire exit stairwell. They meet the Brodys, who were fleeing up the stairwell that is flooding with sharks. They break down a door to escape the stairwell and leave the building.\n\nApril flees the hospital, taking a fire truck to meet Fin and the others. At the Empire State Building, a third tornado is expected to merge with the other two. Fin plans to detonate a tank of Freon at the top of the building by connecting it to the structure's lightning rod to halt the storm. He rallies a crowd of New Yorkers, including the mayor and his task force, to battle the sharks. As he and Skye implement the plan, April, who has affixed a circular saw to her stump, arrives and saves Fin from a falling shark. Skye sacrifices herself to help connect the cables; the Freon explosion throws them in the air where sharks rip Skye in half. While in the twister, Fin grabs onto and rides a great white shark using chains, eventually impaling it on the building's antenna. He reunites with April and finds her lost arm in one of the fallen sharks, using the handgun to kill another one. He then takes the wedding ring from April's severed hand and uses it to propose remarriage, and she accepts.\n\n\nMany of the cameo appearances made nods to previous roles the guests had played. Robert Hays was previously a pilot in \"Airplane!\"; Judd Hirsch was a cab driver in \"Taxi\", Daymond John is a panelist on \"Shark Tank\", Jared Fogle was a longtime spokesman for Subway restaurants, and Billy Ray Cyrus was a doctor in \"Doc\".\n\nWil Wheaton had an uncredited cameo as an airline passenger along with his real life wife Anne. Jason John Beebe also makes an appearance in the film.\n\nLauer and Roker appeared as themselves, hosting \"The Today Show\"; Abrams appeared as an anchor for The Weather Channel. Both of those properties, like Syfy, are owned by Comcast. In contrast, Michael Gelman, Strahan and Ripa all reprised their roles from \"Live with Kelly and Michael\" in the film; that show is not a Comcast property, instead directly competing with \"The Today Show\".\n\nThere are multiple in-jokes about \"Jaws\" (1975). Polly (Peggy Scott) was Mr. Brody's secretary, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) was the chief, Ellen (Lorraine Gary) was his wife, Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) was the mayor's last name, Quint (Robert Shaw) was the shark hunter, and Chrissy (Susan Backlinie) was the name of the first victim.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 61% rating based on 28 critics; the consensus states: \"The schlock factor for \"Sharknado 2: The Second One\" is not as entertaining as its predecessor's, though fans of the brand will likely enjoy it.\" On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 50 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nBrian Lowry of \"Variety\" said the CGI sharks looked terrible. Neil Genzlinger of \"The New York Times\" said that it seems nothing more than dumb fun. Verne Gay of \"Newsday\" said the film doesn't take itself as seriously as the original. He also said the film is not as good as the first.\n\nDon Kaplan of the \"New York Daily News\" said the film was \"a slightly better, more watchable movie than its predecessor.\" Caroline Framke of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film an 'A', stating the \"over-hyped sequel has zero business being this much fun\".\n\nThe sequel was broadcast on SyFy on July 30, 2014. In the UK, Australia and other countries, it was broadcast just minutes behind the US premiere, in most cases on each country's respective SyFy channel. Upon airing, the film was watched by 3.9 million viewers, with 1.6 million in the 18-49 demographic.\n\nFathom Events released the film for one night in theaters across the United States on August 21, 2014.\n\nTwo pieces of tie-in merchandise were released to coincide with the release of \"Sharknado 2\". \"\", an endless runner video game, was released on July 20, 2014 to mostly negative reviews. A comedic survival guide entitled \"How to Survive a Sharknado and Other Unnatural Disasters\" (the book that Tara Reid's character was to promote in the film) was released through Three Rivers Press on July 8, 2014.\n\nJuly 2014 SyFy announced that there would be a \"\" premiering 22 July 2015 taking place in Washington, D.C. & Orlando, FL.\n\nArchie Comics also released a story about Archie Andrews encountering a Sharknado leading up to the third film.\n\nIt aired on the promised date, followed by \"Lavalantula\", which debuted July 25, 2015, the Saturday after \"Sharknado 3\"s Wednesday premiere. \"Lavalantula\" featured \"Sharknado\"s protagonist in a cameo wearing a white T-shirt with crossed chainsaws. This indicates that it takes place in a shared universe. As he says he has \"shark problems right now\", this may indicate that the events of \"Lavalantula\" take place just before or concurrently with \"Sharknado 3\".\n\n\"Sharknado 4\" was confirmed to follow upon \"Sharknado 3\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s premiere.\n\n\"Sharknado 5\" was confirmed in October 2016, and was released on August 6, 2017.\n\n\"Sharknado 6\" was confirmed in February 2018 to follow upon \"Sharknado 5\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s premiere.\n\n"}

Much of the content of traditional Indian arts revolves around the relationship between a man and a woman. The primary emotion thus generated is Sringara. The romantic relationship between lover and beloved is a metaphor for the relationship between the individual and the divine.\n\nClassical theater/dancers (i.e. Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Mohiniyattam) refer to Sringara as 'the Mother of all rasas.' Sringara gives scope for a myriad of other emotions including jealousy, fear, anger, compassion, and of course for the expression of physical intimacy. No other Rasa has such a vast scope.\n\nThe treatment and performance of Sringara varies on a large scale from the grotesque (as in Koodiyattam) to very refined and subtle (as in some styles of Bharatanatyam, or in Odissi).\nThe attraction between lover and beloved is a metaphor for the relationship between the individual and the divine, the Nara-Narayana relationship.

{"id": "29270563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29270563", "title": "The Bourne Legacy (film)", "text": "The Bourne Legacy (film)\n\nThe Bourne Legacy is a 2012 American action thriller film directed by Tony Gilroy, and is the fourth installment in the series of films adapted from the \"Jason Bourne\" novels originated by Robert Ludlum and continued by Eric Van Lustbader, being preceded by \"The Bourne Identity\" (2002), \"The Bourne Supremacy\" (2004), and \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" (2007). Although this film has the same title as Van Lustbader's first \"Bourne\" novel, \"The Bourne Legacy\", the actual screenplay bears little resemblance to the novel. Unlike the novel, which features Jason Bourne as the principal character, the film centers on black ops agent Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner), an original character. In addition to Renner, the film stars Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton.\n\nThe titular character Jason Bourne does not appear in \"The Bourne Legacy\", as actor Matt Damon chose not to return for the fourth film, due to Paul Greengrass not directing. Bourne is shown in pictures and mentioned by name several times throughout the film. Tony Gilroy, co-screenwriter of the first three films, sought to continue the story of the film series without changing its key events, and parts of \"The Bourne Legacy\" take place at the same time as the previous film, \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" (2007).\n\nIn \"The Bourne Legacy\", Aaron Cross is a member of a black ops program called Operation Outcome whose subjects are genetically enhanced. He must run for his life once former CIA Treadstone agent Jason Bourne's actions lead to the public exposure of Operation Treadstone and its successor Operation Blackbriar.\n\nFilming was primarily in New York City, with some scenes shot in the Philippines, South Korea, Pakistan, and Canada. Released on , 2012, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the story, James Newton Howard's score, and Renner's performance, but expressing disappointment in Matt Damon's absence, as well as the lack of shaky camera work (a key element of Greengrass' directorial style) that the second and third films had used. The film was followed in 2016 by \"Jason Bourne\", in which Damon and Greengrass reprised their earlier roles.\n\nSix weeks after Jason Bourne's escape from Moscow, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), an operative belonging to a Defense Department black ops program called Operation Outcome, is assigned to Alaska for a training exercise. He is forced to survive weather extremes and traverse rugged terrain to arrive at a remote cabin as punishment for missing training and going off the grid for four days. The cabin is operated by an exiled Outcome operative, Number Three (Oscar Isaac), who informs Aaron that he has broken the mission record by two days. As an Outcome operative, Aaron uses experimental pills known as \"chems\" (chemicals) which enhance the physical and mental abilities of their users.\n\nAfter the Treadstone and Blackbriar programs are exposed, retired Air Force colonel Eric Byer (Edward Norton) is tasked with containing the fallout. He discovers a potentially scandalous video on the Internet showing a meeting between Treadstone and Outcome medical directors, Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney) and Dan Hillcott (Neil Brooks Cunningham). To prevent the Senate investigation from learning about Outcome, Byer orders everyone associated with the program killed. He sees the sacrifice as acceptable to protect next-generation \"beta programs\", including the supersoldier program LARX.\n\nByer deploys a drone to eliminate Outcome agents Number Three and Five (Aaron) in Alaska. Aaron evades the drone and force-feeds his radio-frequency identification to a wolf which is then blown up by a missile, tricking Byer into believing Aaron is dead. Hirsch dies of an apparent heart attack before he can testify before the Senate. At Sterisyn-Morlanta, a biogenetics company supporting Outcome, researcher Dr. Donald Foite (Željko Ivanek) shoots and kills all but one of his colleagues in the research laboratory. After being cornered by guards, Foite turns his gun on himself, leaving biochemist Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) as the sole survivor. Meanwhile, other Outcome agents are eliminated when their handlers give them poisoned yellow pills disguised as new chems.\n\nFour \"D-Track\" assassins disguised as federal agents visit Marta at her country house. After she states her belief of Foite having been chemically brainwashed into an emotionless killer, the assassins attempt to fake her suicide, but are killed by Aaron. He saves her life as she is his last link to the chems so that he can retain his enhanced capabilities and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Marta reveals that Cross has been genetically modified by a tailored virus to retain the physical benefits permanently without needing the green chems anymore. He still requires regular doses of blue chems to maintain his intelligence, but he is running out. Aaron confides to her that he is Private First Class Kenneth J. Kitsom (reportedly killed by a roadside bomb in the Iraq War) and that his recruiter added twelve points to his IQ, enabling Aaron to meet the United States Army's requirements. Without his enhanced intelligence, Aaron believes they stand no chance of survival. Aaron and Marta travel to Manila, where the chems are manufactured, to try to infect him with another virus so he will not need the blue chems and making his new intelligence permanent.\n\nAaron and Marta bluff their way into the Morlanta Pacific pharmaceutical factory and Marta injects Aaron with the live virus stems. Byer alerts factory security, but Aaron and Marta evade capture. Byer orders LARX-03, a chemically-brainwashed supersoldier, to track and kill them. As Aaron is struck by flu-like symptoms induced by the virus, he hallucinates about his Outcome training. When police surround their shelter while Marta is buying medicine, she warns Aaron by screaming. Aaron rescues her and steals a motorbike. They are pursued by both the police and LARX-03. After a lengthy chase through the streets and marketplaces of Manila to Marikina, they lose the police, but not the assassin. As Aaron, still sick, begins losing consciousness, LARX-03 is killed when Marta causes his motorcycle to crash into a pillar. Marta persuades a Filipino boatman to help them escape by sea.\n\nBack in New York, Blackbriar supervisor Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) lies to the Senate, stating that Blackbriar was created solely to track down Jason Bourne, and that Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) committed treason by assisting Bourne and trying to sell Treadstone secrets to the press.\n\nUniversal Pictures originally intended \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" to be the final film in the series, but development of another film was under way by October 2008. George Nolfi, who co-wrote \"The Bourne Ultimatum\", was to write the script of a fourth film, not to be based on any of the novels by Robert Ludlum. Joshua Zetumer had been hired to write a parallel script—a draft which could be combined with another (Nolfi's, in this instance)—by August 2009 since Nolfi would be directing \"The Adjustment Bureau\" that September. Matt Damon stated in November 2009 that no script had been approved and that he hoped that a film would begin shooting in mid-2011. The next month, he said that he would not do another Bourne film without Paul Greengrass, who announced in late November that he had decided not to return as director. In January 2010, Damon said that there would \"probably be a prequel of some kind with another actor and another director before we do another one just because I think we're probably another five years away from doing it.\"\n\nHowever, it was reported in June 2010 that Tony Gilroy, who co-wrote each of the three previous \"Bourne\" films, would be writing a script with his brother, screenwriter Dan Gilroy, for a fourth \"Bourne\" film to be released sometime in 2012. That October, Universal set the release date for \"The Bourne Legacy\" for August 10, 2012, Tony Gilroy was confirmed as the director of the film, and it was also announced that Jason Bourne will not be appearing in \"The Bourne Legacy\".\n\nGilroy said he did not get involved with the project \"until the rules were that Matt [Damon] was gone, Matt and Paul [Greenglass] were gone, there was no Jason Bourne. That was the given when I had the first conversation about this. So it was very important to me, extremely important to me, that everything that had happened before be well preserved and be enhanced if possible by what we're doing now.\" He also said, \"you could never replace Matt [Damon] as Jason Bourne. This isn't James Bond. You can't do a prequel. You can't do any of those kinds of things, because there was never any cynicism attached to the franchise, and that was the one thing they had to hang on to.\"\n\nGilroy \"never had any intention of ever coming back to this realm at all—much less write it, much less direct it. Then I started a really casual conversation about what we could do in a post-Jason Bourne setting. I was only supposed to come in for two weeks, but the character we came up with, Aaron Cross, was so compelling.\" After watching \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" again, Gilroy called his brother, screenwriter Dan Gilroy, and said, The only thing you could do is sort of pull back the curtain and say there's a much bigger conspiracy.' So we had to deal with what happened in \"Ultimatum\" as the starting point of this film. \"Ultimatum\" plays in the shadows of \"Legacy\" for the first 15 minutes—they overlap.\"\n\nIn speaking about the film's storyline, Gilroy drew a distinction between the fictional programs in the \"Bourne\" film series:\nAlthough a large part of the film was set in and around Washington, DC, the real DC appears only in aerial establishing shots. Most of the film was shot over 12 weeks at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York, including all interior DC scenes. The old house in Hudson, New York, used as Shearing's house was unable to accommodate the weight of equipment and crew, so it was used only for exterior shots, and all interior scenes were filmed on a Kaufman Astoria soundstage. The scenes set in the \"SteriPacific\" factory in Manila were actually filmed in the \"New York Times\" printing plant in Queens.\nSeveral scenes were shot overseas, mostly in Manila and in the Paradise bay of El Nido, Palawan, in the Philippines. Several train scenes at Garak Market Station on Seoul Subway Line 3 and nearby areas in Seocho-daero 77-Gil (1308 Seocho 4-dong), Seocho-gu, and Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea, were used in some scenes. The Kananaskis Country region of Alberta, Canada, was used for the scenes set in Alaska.\n\nGilroy said, \"there are three deleted scenes—we just mixed them and color corrected them [...] but what I like about it is all three scenes happen in the movie. One of them's referred to and they're completely legitimate parts of our story, they absolutely happen in our film, we just didn't have time to show them to you so there's nothing off to the side. I think they'll be on the straight-up DVD.\"\n\nThe film portrays Cross and Shearing as traveling nonstop from New York JFK Airport to Manila on board an American Airlines Boeing 747-400. That particular 747 model was introduced in 1989; American Airlines has never flown one; American Airlines has never served Manila as a destination; no commercial airline has ever flown from JFK to Manila nonstop with passenger service; the distance between the two cities exceeds the maximum range of any model 747. In spite of these continuity lapses, American Airlines was actively involved in the production of the film in cooperation with NBCUniversal, and contributed its own airline employees and a Boeing 777-200 for the interior terminal and cabin shots at Terminal 8 of JFK International Airport. The airline also heavily co-marketed the film throughout post-production.\n\n\"The Bourne Legacy\" premiered in New York City on July 30, 2012. It had its Asian premiere at Resorts World Manila in Pasay City, Metro Manila, on , before its release in North America on August 10.\n\nIn its opening weekend, \"The Bourne Legacy\" grossed about $38.7 million in the United States and Canada and debuted at #1 of the box office charts, surpassing Universal's expectation of $35 million. It grossed $46.6 million worldwide in its first weekend. The film sold roughly 400,000 more tickets on its opening weekend than the first film in the series, \"The Bourne Identity\". Studio research reported that audiences were evenly mixed among the sexes. The film grossed $113,203,870 in North America and $162,940,880 in foreign countries, bringing the film's worldwide total to $276,144,750.\n\n\"The Bourne Legacy\" received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 219 reviews with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"It isn't quite as compelling as the earlier trilogy, but \"The Bourne Legacy\" proves the franchise has stories left to tell—and benefits from Jeremy Renner's magnetic work in the starring role.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 61 out of 100 based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nLisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film an A-, commenting that \"Gilroy, who as a screenwriter has shaped the movie saga from the beginning, trades the wired rhythms established in the past two episodes by Paul Greengrass for something more realistic and closer to the ground. The change is refreshing. Jason Bourne's legacy is in good hands.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 2½ stars out of 4, writing: \"\"The Bourne Legacy\" is always gripping in the moment. The problem is in getting the moments to add up. I freely confess that for at least the first 30 minutes I had no clear idea of why anything was happening. The dialogue is concise, the cinematography is arresting and the plot is a murky muddle.\"\n\nPeter Debruge of \"Variety\" wrote that \"the combination of Robert Elswit's elegant widescreen lensing and the measured editing by Tony Gilroy's brother John may be easier to absorb than Greengrass' hyperkinetic docu-based style, but the pic's convoluted script ensures that auds will emerge no less overwhelmed.\" Michael Atkinson of \"The Village Voice\" also wrote a scathing review of the film, saying: \"The \"Bourne\" films have more than just overstayed their welcome and outlasted the Ludlum books—they've been Van Halenized, with an abrupt change of frontman and a resulting dip in personality.\"\n\nKenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave the film a positive review, called the film \"an exemplary espionage thriller that has a strong sense of what it wants to accomplish and how best to get there.\" He especially commended Gilroy's work on the film: \"Gilroy knows the underpinnings of this world inside out and appreciates how essential it is to maintain and extend the house style of cool and credible intelligence that marked the previous films.\" Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" commented on his review that \"the series' legacy is lessened by this capable but uninspired fourth episode.\"\n\n\"The Bourne Legacy\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 11, 2012, in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"The Bourne Legacy\" as composed by James Newton Howard, unlike the previous films, which were composed by John Powell, was released digitally on , by Varèse Sarabande Records. A new version of Moby's \"Extreme Ways\", entitled \"Extreme Ways (Bourne's Legacy)\", was recorded for the film's end credits.\n\nUniversal Pictures stated at a media conference in Los Angeles, California, that they are likely to release more \"Bourne\" films, despite \"The Bourne Legacy\" being given mixed reviews by critics. In a December 2012 interview, Matt Damon revealed that he and Paul Greengrass were interested in returning for the next film as Jason Bourne and the director, respectively.\n\nDamon is reported saying that although he had not seen \"Legacy\", he intends to do so because not only is he curious to see it, but also because he has enjoyed Jeremy Renner in everything he has seen him in. However, as of June 2014, executive producer Frank Marshall said that Matt Damon will not be returning to the big screen for the next \"Bourne\" film, contrary to earlier statements made by Damon and rumors surrounding his return to the franchise. On February 21, 2013, it was confirmed that a \"Bourne 5\" was being planned.\n\nOn August 2, 2013, Universal hired Tony Gilroy and Anthony Peckham to write the film's script with Renner returning as Cross. On November 8, 2013, \"The Fast and the Furious\" film series director Justin Lin was announced to direct the film.\n\nOn December 2, 2013, it was announced that Renner will return as Cross, Lin will both direct and produce from his production company Perfect Storm Entertainment, and the studio announced an August 14, 2015 release date. On May 9, 2014, Andrew Baldwin was brought in to re-write the film.\n\nOn June 18, 2014, the studio pushed back the film from August 14, 2015, to July 15, 2016. In November 2014, the \"Bourne Legacy\" sequel was put on hold in favor of \"Jason Bourne\", which Damon confirmed that he and Greengrass would return to.\n\nOn January 6, 2015, the studio pushed back the release date to July 29, 2016. The first trailer for the film was aired on February 7, 2016 during Super Bowl 50, which also revealed its title as \"Jason Bourne\". The film premiered in the United States on July 29, 2016 to mixed reviews.\n\nProducer Frank Marshall said Universal Pictures is hoping to plan a sequel to \"Jason Bourne\", making it the sixth Bourne film. He also stated that a sequel to \"The Bourne Legacy\" featuring Renner's Cross is unlikely, although he did not explicitly rule it out. However, in March 2017, Matt Damon cast doubt upon a sequel, hinting that people \"might be done\" with the character.\n\n\n"}

The show follows two childhood friends from age six to 35 and has only two characters.\n\nThe musical debuted at Canadian Stage Company in Toronto in 2006 starring Brent Carver and Jeffrey Kuhn and premiered on Broadway in February 2009, closing after nineteen previews and five regular performances.\n\nThe musical follows a lifelong friendship between two men, Alvin and Thomas, whose childhood bond continues throughout their adult years. Amazon.com describes the musical as \"an authentic and affecting work, told through a series of songs in turn playful, touching and dramatic, and expertly orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick. One New York critic predicted, 'When the original cast recording comes out, see if you don't find yourself moved to Google the name of some long-lost friend with whom you simply lost touch. \"The Story Of My Life\" inspires us to reconnect with those who were part of the earliest chapters of our own life stories'.\"\n\nSummary\n\nThomas stands alone, contemplating how to write his eulogy for his best friend Alvin's funeral. He comes to the conclusion that it should be about his life with Alvin (\"Write What You Know\") but cannot bring himself to write anything down. He is then visited by the ghost of Alvin, who tells him that they will write story after story about their childhood, until Thomas has completed the eulogy. Alvin walks around the room and removes stories from the room’s bookshelves, which make up the musical’s remaining songs.\n\nStarting at the beginning of their friendship, Alvin recalls their meeting in \"Mrs. Remington('s)\" first-grade class where Alvin was the only student to recognize that Thomas was dressed as Clarence (from \"It's a Wonderful Life\") for Halloween. The two became inseparable, with Thomas spending more and more time with Alvin in his father’s bookstore. Alvin gives Thomas “The Greatest Gift” of a copy of \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\", which inspires Thomas’ sixth-grade book report (“1876”). This book report inspired Thomas to be a writer and, outside the story, Thomas tries to pull the focus back to writing Alvin’s eulogy.\n\nAlvin removes a story from the shelf, which is about his abnormal tendencies and Thomas’ attempts to reign them in (“Normal”). The story ends with a group of bullies throwing Alvin’s bathrobe, which belonged to his deceased mother, over a bridge. Alvin is sad but hopeful that “People Carry On” after a loss. In another story, Thomas reads his college entrance essay on the Butterfly Effect (“The Butterfly”) to Alvin. Thomas is accepted into college and leaves Alvin, who is now working at his father’s bookstore, behind (“Saying Goodbye, Part 1”). When Thomas comes home for Christmas, he talks about his creative process; this bores Alvin, who wants to play in the snow as they did when they were young (“Here’s Where It Begins”).\n\nThomas leaves, graduates, and becomes a semi-famous writer. When he returns home again, he brings home his “colleague, girlfriend, and number-one fan” Anne. Alvin worries that Anne will draw Thomas away from him and seems sad about his life in the bookstore, which he assumes ownership of after his father gets sick (“Saying Goodbye, Part 2”). Thomas returns home to help Alvin with the paperwork to finish the transfer of ownership. Alvin asks Thomas to stay in town with him, but Thomas invites Alvin to join him in the city instead (“Independence Day”). After receiving many excited phone calls from Alvin, Thomas tells him that he shouldn’t come after all because it’s “not a good time,” and then breaks up with Anne (“I Like It Here”).\n\nThomas doesn’t tell Alvin about the break-up, and tries to “streamline his personal life” to avoid writer’s block. Alvin writes Thomas from the bookstore to congratulate him on his continued success (“You’re Amazing, Tom”). Thomas ignores the letters and stops coming home, suffering from writer’s block while writing about the angles in the snow (“Nothing There”).\n\nThomas goes home yet again and sneaks in to watch Alvin deliver the eulogy at his father’s funeral, which is made up of “story after story after story.” Thomas is mad that Alvin is at ease telling the stories and, in retrospect, recognizes that he didn’t see the struggles Alvin faced at the time (“I Didn’t See Alvin”). Thomas notes that this was the last time he saw Alvin alive.\n\nAfter finishing the story of his father’s eulogy, Alvin attempts one last time to bring Thomas back to writing the eulogy for his own funeral (“This Is It”). Thomas finally sits and finishes his “work in progress” about their childhood Christmas traditions (“Angels in the Snow”), and finally delivers his eulogy—a collection of stories—for Alvin.\n\nFollowing developmental readings at Manhattan Theatre Club, The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, and Canadian Stage Company, \"The Story of My Life\" was produced in Toronto at the Canadian Stage Company in 2006. It was next produced at the National Alliance for Musical Theatre's Festival of New Musicals in the fall of 2007.\n\nThe musical then ran at Goodspeed Musicals, East Haddam, Connecticut from October 10, 2008 through November 2.

The production was directed by Susanne Sangill.\n\nThe original Broadway Cast Album was produced by PS Classics.\n\n\nBen Brantley, in a review in \"The New York Times\", wrote that \"In addition to jettisoning the usual excesses of tourist-trapping extravaganzas, they have tossed away such niceties as originality, credibility, tension and excitement...Mr. Chase and Mr. Gets sing and act with winning (and, under the circumstances, merciful) restraint.\"\n\nMichael Kuchwara, in his \"Associated Press\" review, wrote \"The Story of My Life is a heartfelt little musical that has the courage of its sweet-tempered, low-key convictions. These days, that's a novelty. In a Broadway world of big musicals determined to sell themselves, this gentle new show celebrates softly but with an emotional pull that slowly wins you over.\"\n\nNY1's Roma Torre said \"Partners Neil Bartram, who wrote the music and lyrics, and Brian Hill, who wrote the obviously Sondheim-inspired book, fine-tuned this work with a keen insight for those seemingly inconsequential moments in relationships that turn out to be magically momentous. Bartram's lovely songs resonate on many levels, while Richard Maltby Jr. adds further dimension with his sharply-etched direction. Will Chase as Thomas and Malcolm Gets as Alvin are exceptionally talented. So perfectly matched in ways both subtle and large, they deliver splendidly calibrated performances that are simply flawless...This is an impressive collaborative effort that, despite its minimalism, has the power to pack quite an emotional punch.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "53418337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53418337", "title": "Trump Tower wiretapping allegations", "text": "Trump Tower wiretapping allegations\n\nOn March 4, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump wrote a series of posts on his Twitter account that accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones at his Trump Tower office late in the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump called for a congressional investigation into the matter, and the Trump administration cited news reports to defend these accusations.\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, vowed to investigate the claim. At a House Intelligence Committee open hearing on March 20, 2017, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey stated that neither the FBI nor the Department of Justice (DOJ) possessed any information to support Donald Trump's wiretapping allegations. Nunes stated on March 23 that the Trump administration's communications might have been legally monitored during the transition period as part of an \"incidental collection\".\n\nThe DOJ declared in a September 1, 2017 court filing that \"both the FBI and NSD confirm that they have no records related to wiretaps as described by the March 4, 2017 tweets,\" and confirmed this in another court filing of October 19, 2018. On September 19, 2017 CNN reported that the FBI wiretapped Paul Manafort before and after the presidential election, extending into early 2017, although the report did not make clear whether Manafort was monitored during his tenure with the Trump campaign from March through August 2016. The CNN report also stated that the Manafort surveillance began after he became the subject of an FBI investigation in 2014. Some commentators cited this report as vindication for Trump's claims, while others noted that it did not confirm the accuracy of Trump's original tweets, and that it is still unknown whether any surveillance of Manafort took place at Trump Tower. Manafort owned a condominium in Trump Tower from 2006 until its seizure by federal authorities following his 2018 convictions.\n\nOn November 7, 2016, Louise Mensch reported in the right-leaning \"Heat Street\", that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had twice sought Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants in connection with its investigation of the Trump campaign's links to Russia. According to Mensch, the first request for a warrant which \"named Trump\" was denied in June 2016 and, a second, more \"narrowly drawn\" request was granted in October 2016. Mensch wrote that this warrant gave \"counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of 'U.S. persons' in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia,\" and to \"look at the full content of emails and other related documents that may concern US persons\". Mensch further claimed that the October warrant was granted in \"connection with the investigation of suspected activity between the server [in Trump Tower] and two banks, SVB Bank and Alfa Bank,\" and that \"it is thought in the intelligence community that the warrant covers any 'US person' connected to this investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men.\" Mensch's article cited reports from two anonymous \"sources with links to the counter-intelligence community.\"\n\nOn January 19, \"The New York Times\" published an article with the print headline \"Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides\". The article was published online with the title \"Intercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates\". The article stated that \"American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\" The article also noted the uncertainty regarding the scope of the wiretapping, stating: \"It is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump's campaign, or Mr. Trump himself.\"\n\nOn March 3, \"Breitbart News\" ran an article by Joel Pollak headlined \"Mark Levin to Congress: Investigate Obama's 'Silent Coup' vs. Trump.\" On the previous day, right-wing radio personality Mark Levin alleged that Obama and his allies were conducting a \"silent coup\" against Trump, and asked: \"How many phone calls of Donald Trump, if any, have been intercepted by the administration and recorded by the Obama administration?\" The \"Breitbart\" article alleged that \"the Obama administration is now monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence services\". Citing Mensch's November article, \"Breitbart\" claimed the existence of a June FISA request \"to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several advisers\", and of an October FISA warrant \"focused on a computer server in Trump Tower.\" Breitbart cited a January 11 \"National Review\" article, which speculated about alleged \"wiretaps\" of the Trump campaign and their legal ramifications. Like the \"Breitbart\" article, the \"National Review\" article had also extensively relied on Mensch's piece.\n\nBoth \"McClatchy\" and BBC reported on the existence of an October FISA warrant, as did Mensch. However, these accounts differed substantially from Mensch's story with respect to the scope and purpose of the warrant. They alleged that the October warrant authorized to monitor financial transactions related to Russia — not communications. Unlike the derivative accounts in \"National Review\" and \"Breitbart\", Mensch's original article did not use the term \"wiretap\" (implying voice telephone calls), but only made claims about e-mail exchanged with SVB Bank and the Russian Alfa-Bank. While Mensch did claim the e-mail server was located in Trump Tower, it was likely located in Lititz, Pennsylvania, as Trump outsourced e-mail to Listrak, which operates out of a data center there. Furthermore, \"The New York Times\" reported on October 31 that the FBI had concluded that the server traffic could have been explained by marketing emails or spam. Contrary to \"The Times\", Mensch claimed that the server's activity remained suspicious enough to lead the FBI to request the FISA warrant.\n\nThe \"Breitbart\" article was subsequently circulated among White House staffers, and was reportedly given to Trump on the following day, together with his morning newspapers and printouts.\n\nIn a succession of tweets on March 4, President Donald Trump stated he had \"just found out\" that former president Barack Obama had wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower during the last month of the 2016 election. He did not say where he had obtained the information and offered no evidence to support it. Trump compared the alleged intrusion to McCarthyism and Watergate. Anonymous White House officials told \"The Washington Post\" that Trump did not appear to coordinate his comments with other White House officials.\n\nThe White House claimed that reports \"from BBC, \"Heat Street\", \"New York Times\", Fox News, among others\" established the president's wiretapping allegation, providing links of these to \"The Washington Post\".\n\nIn a statement issued through press secretary Sean Spicer on March 5, Trump asked congressional intelligence committees to \"determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016\" as part of their investigation into Russian interference in the election. In response, Representative Devin Nunes, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, stated that the committee \"will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party's campaign officials or surrogates.\" Senator Lindsey Graham stated his willingness to use subpoena powers to find out whether Trump was investigated and what the cause for such an investigation was, if it did occur. On March 15, Nunes reported that the House Intelligence Committee had not found any evidence supporting the wiretapping claim.\n\nWhite House officials gave discordant responses to initial media inquiries about Trump's accusations. Spicer banned cameras in the briefing room at a press conference the following day. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News's \"Fox & Friends\" that the president had \"information and intelligence that the rest of us do not,\" although Spicer later said Conway was not qualified to make that claim.\n\nDuring an interview on March 12, Conway told \"The Record\"'s Mike Kelly that the surveillance could have potentially used hacked electronic devices: \"You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets — any number of ways.\" She also suggested that Trump could have been monitored with \"microwaves that turn into cameras.\" Conway later retracted the claim, stating that \"I'm not Inspector Gadget, I don't believe that people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign.\"\n\nAt a March 13 press briefing, Spicer claimed that Trump was referring to general surveillance rather than direct wiretapping. Spicer also said that the White House believed that the Obama administration was responsible for the surveillance, not Obama himself, said Trump's tweet which specifically named the former president.\n\nIn a March 15 interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News, Trump supported his claims of wiretapping by citing a March 3 interview with Paul Ryan on an episode of \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" on Fox News and the January 19 \"New York Times\" article. While \"The New York Times\" article mentioned \"wiretapping\" and reported that the FBI was \"examining intercepted communications and financial transactions\", it stipulated neither the targeting of American citizens for surveillance, nor any involvement in such surveillance by the Obama administration. Trump's March 15 assertion that the \"Times\"' article supported his allegations about wiretapping was deemed \"false\" by PolitiFact. On \"Special Report\" Brett Baier alleged that the FBI got a FISA warrant in October to \"start a wiretap at Trump Tower with some computer and Russian banks and it doesn't show up anything [referring to the Trump campaign's alleged links to Russian election meddling], by reporting,\" and asked Ryan: \"Have you heard that?\" Ryan responded: \"Well, again, like I said, none of us in Congress or anybody I know in Congress has been presented with anything to the contrary of what you just said.\" However, there may have been a misunderstanding between Baier and Ryan throughout the interview, with Baier asking about undue surveillance of the Trump campaign, and Ryan responding that intelligence gathering had produced no evidence of collusion between Russia and Trump. Ryan stated, in response to a question about Trump's March 15 comments, that he had been unaware of any wiretapping allegations prior to his interview with Baier, and that \"the intelligence committees ... have determined ... that no such wiretap existed.\"\n\nDuring a March 14 \"Fox & Friends\" interview, Andrew Napolitano said that \"Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command,\" using the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to implement surveillance to avoid leaving \"American fingerprints.\" Napolitano accused Robert Hannigan, who resigned from the GCHQ on January 23, of ordering the wiretap. Hannigan reportedly resigned for personal reasons. Fox News anchor Bret Baier later stated that \"the Fox News division was never able to back up [Napolitano's] claims.\" Napolitano was reportedly temporarily taken off air by Fox due to the allegations. One of Napolitano's sources was former intelligence officer Larry C. Johnson, who later told CNN that Napolitano had misrepresented the statements he made on an online discussion board. Johnson, citing two anonymous sources, claimed that the GCHQ was passing information on the Trump campaign to US intelligence through a \"back-channel\", but stressed that the GCHQ did not \"wiretap\" Trump or his associates and that alleged information sharing by the GCHQ was not done at the direction of the Obama administration.\n\nOn March 16, Spicer repeated Napolitano's claim at a White House press briefing. The following day, GCHQ responded with a rare public statement: \"Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct 'wiretapping' against the then president-elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.\" A British government source said the allegation was \"totally untrue and quite frankly absurd\". Admiral Michael S. Rogers, director of the National Security Agency (NSA), said he has seen nothing to suggest that there was \"any such activity\" nor any request to do so. Former GCHQ director David Omand told \"Financial Times\" that \"The suggestion that [Barack Obama] asked GCHQ to spy on Trump is just completely barking — that would be evident to anyone who knew the system.\"\n\nThe claim started a diplomatic dispute with Britain. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader in Britain, said \"Trump is compromising the vital UK-US security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment. This harms our and US security.\" \"The Telegraph\" said that two U.S. officials had personally apologized for the allegation. The British government also said that the U.S. government promised not to repeat these claims. The White House denied reports that it had apologized to the British government, saying Spicer was merely \"pointing to public reports\" without endorsing them.\n\nOn April 12, 2017, \"The Guardian\" reported that GCHQ (and other European intelligence agencies) had intercepted communications between members of the Trump campaign team and Russian officials, and shared the intelligence with their US counterparts. The communications were obtained through \"incidental collection\" as part of routine surveillance of Russian intelligence assets, not from a targeted operation against Trump or his campaign.\n\nShortly after FBI James Comey publicly announced the counterintelligence investigation into Russian collusion, Robert Hannigan flew to Washington, D.C., according to The New Yorker: \"Robert Hannigan, then the head of the U.K.'s intelligence service the G.C.H.Q., had recently flown to Washington and briefed the C.I.A.'s director, John Brennan, on a stream of illicit communications between Trump's team and Moscow that had been intercepted. (The content of these intercepts has not become public.)\" \n\nOn January 11, 2017, \"The Guardian\" reported that the FBI initially applied for a FISA warrant in June 2016, requesting to \"monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials.\" This initial request was denied. A source told \"The Guardian\" that the FBI then submitted a more narrowly focused request in October, \"but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation.\" \"The Guardian\" article was not cited by the White House in connection with Trump's wiretapping claim.\n\nThe day after \"The Guardian\" report, \"BBC\" journalist Paul Wood separately reported that, in response to an April 2016 tip from a foreign intelligence agency to the CIA about \"money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign\", a joint task force had been established including representatives of the FBI, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the NSA; and in June 2016 lawyers from the FBI had applied to the FISA court for \"permission to intercept the electronic records from two Russian banks.\" The BBC alleged that the investigation was prompted in April 2016 by a \"tip\" from an intelligence agency of one of the Baltic States. According to Wood, this application was rejected, as was a more narrowly focused request in July, and the order was finally granted by a different FISA judge on October 15, three weeks before the presidential election. According to the article, the warrant did not name Trump or his associates.\n\nOn January 18, \"McClatchy\" separately reported that \"the FBI had obtained a warrant on Oct. 15 from the highly secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allowing investigators access to bank records and other documents about potential payments and money transfers related to Russia.\" The \"McClatchy\" article was not cited by the White House in connection with Trump's wiretapping claim.\n\nIn April 2017, \"The Washington Post\" initially reported that the FBI secured a FISA warrant to monitor Trump campaign associate Carter Page in the summer of 2016 — later corrected to October 2016, one month after Page had left the Trump campaign. The warrant was reportedly based on the possibility that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign government, i.e., Russia.\n\nOn September 18, 2017, CNN reported that the FBI wiretapped Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, from as early as 2014 through an unspecified time before the 2016 election, and also after the election through early 2017, pursuant to two separate FISA court orders. It has not been confirmed whether Trump's conversations with Manafort were intercepted as part of this surveillance. CNN acknowledged that prior to this disclosure, \"speculation has run rampant about whether Manafort or others associated with Trump were under surveillance.\" The CNN report noted that it was unclear if Manafort was under FBI surveillance while he resided in Trump Tower.\n\nIn its March 5 analysis of the reporting that preceded Trump's allegations, \"The Washington Post\" stated that \"the articles all suggest that the FISA requests—if they happened—were done by the intelligence agencies and the FBI,\" and not by the Obama administration. According to \"The Post\", Mensch's article was the only one to have alleged any surveillance of Trump Tower. No major news organizations have been able to confirm Mensch's account, despite prolonged efforts by \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\". This absence of verification, combined with Mensch's reliance on \"vague\" and anonymous sourcing to individuals \"with links to the counter-intelligence community,\" lead \"The Times\" and \"The Post\" to urge skepticism about the veracity of her account.\n\nSome Trump supporters cited the Manafort wiretap report as vindicating Trump's March 2017 tweets. However, David A. Graham of \"The Atlantic\" responded: \"This is not true—Trump claimed he had been the subject of Obama-ordered, politically motivated surveillance, for which there remains no evidence.\" While acknowledging that \"it does make for a more complicated picture than previously known,\" Graham argued \"there are reasons to doubt\" that Trump was even aware of the Manafort wiretap at the time he made his unsupported allegations against Obama. Graham concluded: \"Insofar as there are parallels between what Pollak, Levin, and Napolitano said and the new story, it looks like luck.\" Aaron Blake of \"The Washington Post\" noted that, according to CNN, lawyers for both Trump and Manafort convinced the two men to discontinue their phone conversations some time after Trump took office: \"If Trump's lawyers somehow knew about and fought back against the Manafort wiretap, it stands to reason that Trump himself might have been aware of it. ... While we don't know the exact timing of all of this, perhaps this is what Trump was referring to and he, as he is wont to do, exaggerated it.\"\n\nThere has been criticism of Trump's claim as simply being a \"dead cat\", a false allegation against Obama intended to direct media and public interest away from Trump and his team's alleged connections with Russia.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress distanced themselves from the claim and refused to comment on it, although members of both the Senate and House of Representatives vowed to investigate the matter.\n\nObama spokesman Kevin Lewis repudiated the claim in a statement later that day saying: \"A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice.\" \"The Wall Street Journal\" described Obama as \"livid\" when he heard about the allegations personally, though other sources said he \"rolled his eyes\" and remained more concerned about Trump's conservative and nationalist agenda. When the Obama administration's former press secretary Josh Earnest was asked by ABC News's Martha Raddatz if he could deny that the Obama Justice Department had sought and obtained a FISA court-ordered wiretap of the Trump campaign, he responded, \"I don't know ... The president was not giving marching orders to the FBI about how to conduct their investigations.\"\n\nOn March 23, Devin Nunes stated that communications to and from Trump's presidential transition team may have been intercepted as part of incidental collection. In response, officials in the Obama administration refuted any claims that it had been monitoring the Trump team. Nunes said the surveillance was unrelated to the Russia investigation and \"suggested the contents may have been inappropriately disseminated in intelligence reports ... for political reasons.\" Later the same day, Nunes said that he did not know \"for sure\" whether intelligence committees had actually monitored the Trump team's communications. In September, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice stated that a December 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump transition officials and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) raised suspicions because the UAE allegedly failed to give the Obama administration advance notice of Zayed's visit to the U.S., as is customary. Therefore, to better understand the intent of the meeting, she \"requested the names of the Americans mentioned in the classified report be revealed internally\" (or \"unmasked\"). According to CNN's Manu Ragu, while Nunes implied that such \"unmasking\" may have been improper—an allegation that the Trump administration used to deflect from Trump's original wiretap claim—Rice's \"explanation appears to have satisfied some influential Republicans on the committee, undercutting both Nunes and Trump.\" Republican Representative Mike Conaway affirmed: \"She was a good witness, answered all our questions. I'm not aware of any reason to bring her back.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul pointed out that a backdoor intercept of Trump's communications was possible. Elizabeth Goitein, a surveillance law expert at New York University, pointed out that backdoor searches of incidental records collected on Americans overseas were allowed by U.S. law. Republican Representative Frank LoBiondo, a senior member on the House Intelligence Committee, speculated on March 20, after Comey's testimony to the Committee, that it was possible there was incidental collection that occurred due to targeting Russian communications, but expressed doubt that there was any evidence that there was such a wiretap. Incidental collection—also called backdoor collection by politicians such as Democratic Senator Ron Wyden—has been publicly acknowledged by the intelligence community for years.\n\nOn March 4, FBI director James Comey asked the Justice Department to issue a statement refuting Trump's claims. Speaking to NBC's \"Meet the Press\", former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said \"For the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the President-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign.\"\n\nAt a House Intelligence Committee open hearing on March 20, 2017, Comey stated that neither the FBI nor the Justice Department possessed any information to support Trump's wiretapping allegations.\n\nOn September 1, 2017, a DOJ court filing stated that \"both the FBI and NSD <nowiki>[</nowiki>United States Department of Justice National Security Division<nowiki>]</nowiki> confirm that they have no records related to wiretaps as described by the March 4, 2017 tweets.\" Furthermore, it said that the Department of Justice and the FBI \"do not confirm or deny the existence\" of any other records that are responsive to American Oversight's FOIA request, which was broader than the alleged wiretaps of Trump Tower.\n"}
{"id": "95673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95673", "title": "Voice acting", "text": "Voice acting\n\nVoice acting is the art of performing voice-overs or providing voices to represent a character or to provide information to an audience or user. Examples include animated, off-stage, off-screen or non-visible characters in various works, including feature films, dubbed foreign language films, animated short films, television programs, commercials, radio or audio dramas, comedy, video games, puppet shows, amusement rides, audiobooks and documentaries. Voice acting is also done for small handheld audio games.\n\nPerformers are called voice actors or actresses, voice artists or voice talent. Their roles may also involve singing, although a second voice actor is sometimes cast as the character's singing voice. Voice acting is recognised in Britain as a specialized dramatic profession, chiefly owing to the BBC's long tradition of radio drama.\n\nVoice artists are also used to record the individual sample fragments played back by a computer in an automated announcement.\n\nThe voices for animated characters are provided by voice actors. For live action productions, voice acting often involves reading the parts of computer programs, radio dispatchers, or other characters who never actually appear on screen. With a radio drama or Compact Disc drama, there is more freedom in voice acting, because there is no need to match a dub to the original actors, or to match an animated character.\n\nProducers and agencies are on the look out for many styles of voices such as booming voices, which maybe perfect for more dramatic productions or cute, young sounding voices that are perfect for trendier markets.\n\nSome just sound like regular, natural, everyday people and all of these voices have their place in the Voiceover world, provided they are used correctly and in the right context.\n\nIn the context of voice acting, narration is the use of spoken commentary to convey a story to an audience. A narrator is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the plot. The voice actor who plays the narrator is responsible for performing the scripted lines assigned to the narrator.\n\nIn traditional literary narratives (such as novels, short stories, and memoirs), narration is a required story element; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.\n\nOne of the most common uses for voice acting is within commercial advertising. The voice actor is hired to voice a message associated with the advertisement. This has different subgenres; television, radio, cinema, and web-advertising. The subgenres are all different styles in their own right. For example, television commercials tend to be voiced with a narrow, flat inflection pattern (or prosody pattern), whereas radio (especially local radio) commercials tend to be voiced with a very wide inflection pattern in an almost over-the-top style. \n\nMarkerters and advertisers use voiceover all over their projects, from radio, to TV, to online and more! Total advertising spend in the UK is forecast to be £21.8 billion in 2017.\n\nVoiceover used in commercial adverts also is the only area of voice acting where de-breathing is used. De-breathing means artificially removing breaths from the recorded voice. This is done to stop the audience being distracted in any way from the commercial message that is being put across.\n\nDub localization is a type of voice-over. It is the practice of voice-over translation altering a foreign language film, art film or television series by voice actors.\n\nVoice-over translation is an audiovisual translation technique, in which, unlike in Dub localization, actor voices are recorded over the original audio track, which can be heard in the background. This method of translation is most often used in documentaries and news reports to translate words of foreign-language interviewees.\n\nAutomated dialogue replacement (ADR) is the process of re-recording dialogue by the original actor after the filming process to improve audio quality or reflect dialogue changes (also known as \"looping\" or a \"looping session\"). ADR is also used to change original lines recorded on set to clarify context, improve diction or timing, or to replace an accented vocal performance. In the UK, it is also called \"post-synchronization\" or \"post-sync\".\n\nVoice artists are also used to record the individual sample fragments played back by a computer in an automated announcement. At its simplest, each recording consists of a short phrase which is played back when necessary, e.g. the \"Mind the gap\" announcement introduced by London Underground in 1969. In a more complicated system, such as a speaking clock, the announcement is re-assembled from fragments such as \"minutes past\" \"eighteen\" and \"p.m.\" For example, the word \"twelve\" can be used for both \"Twelve O'Clock\" and \"Six Twelve.\"\n\nAutomated announcements can also include on-hold messages on phone systems and location-specific announcements in tourist attractions.\n\n occupations include performing roles in anime, audio dramas and video games, performing voice-overs for dubs of non-Japanese movies, and providing narration to documentaries and similar programs. Because the animation industry in Japan is so prolific, voice actors in Japan are able to have full-time careers as voice-over artists. Japanese voice actors are able to take greater charge of their careers than voice actors in other countries. Japan has approximately 130 voice acting schools and troupes of voice actors, who work for a specific broadcast company or talent agency. They often attract their own appreciators and fans, who watch shows specifically to hear their favorite actor or actress.\n\nMany Japanese voice actors frequently branch into music, often singing the opening or closing themes of shows in which their character stars, or become involved in non-animated side projects such as audio dramas (involving the same characters in new story lines) or image songs (songs sung in character that are not included in the anime but which further develop the character).\n\nFrom 1988 to 1994, the United Kingdom banned broadcasting of the voices of people linked to violence in Northern Ireland; television circumvented this using actors' voices synchronized to footage of prohibited people speaking.\n\nAlthough voice acting is criticized heavily in Brazil, most of the films in the theaters are dubbed in Portuguese, and most Brazilians prefer watching movies in their native language. Voice acting in Brazil has been highly acclaimed by other countries. Many voice actors are also dubbing directors, people that direct other voice actors, and translators. To become a voice actor in Brazil, you need to be a professional actor and attend dubbing courses. Celebrities in Brazil have done voice acting, although Brazilians generally do not like when celebrities who are not actors do voice acting.\n\nAs Colombian Spanish is considered one of the most clear forms of Spanish , a great deal of Spanish language voice acting is in Colombia using local voice talent. Colombia voice over services are one of the most popular followed by synchronization and subtitling, according to Alexander Torrenegra .\n\nAcross many of the main game-manufacturing countries, in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, actors often lend their voices to characters in games and some have made a career of it. Their names have sometimes been linked to a particular character they have voiced. Among the many noted video-game voice actors are Maaya Sakamoto (the Japanese voice for the \"Final Fantasy XIII\" character Lightning), Tatsuhisa Suzuki (the voice of Noctis Lucis Caelum in \"Final Fantasy XV\"), Miyu Irino (the Japanese voice of Sora in the \" Kingdom Hearts \" series), Troy Baker (English Snow Villiers, Joel in \"The Last of Us\"), David Hayter (Solid Snake and Big Boss of the \"Metal Gear\" series), Steve Downes and Jen Taylor (Master Chief and Cortana from the \"Halo\" series), Nolan North (Nathan Drake from the \"Uncharted\" games and Desmond Miles from the \"Assassin's Creed\" game series), Charles Martinet (the voice of Mario, Luigi, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi in Nintendo's \"Mario\" franchise), Liam O'Brien (the voice of Caius Ballad in \"Final Fantasy XIII-2\" and War in \"Darksiders\"), and Jonell Elliot (the voice of Lara Croft from 1999-2003). Other actors more linked with the film, radio or television industry have also voiced video game characters. These actors include Mark Hamill (The Joker, Wolverine and the Watcher from \"Darksiders\"), Michael Dorn (various characters from \"World of Warcraft\" and Gatatog Uvenk from \"Mass Effect 2\"), Claudia Black (Chloe Frazer from the second and third entries in the \"Uncharted\" series, Morrigan from Dragon Age), Camilla Luddington (the voice of Lara Croft in 2013), Kristen Bell (Lucy Stillman in the first three mainline entries in the \"Assassin's Creed\" franchise), DB Cooper (\"BioShock 2\", \"Grand Theft Auto\" series), and Ikue Ōtani (the voice of Pikachu).\n"}
{"id": "57160030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57160030", "title": "Women in documentary film", "text": "Women in documentary film\n\nWomen in documentary film describes the role of women as directors, writers, performers, producers, and other film industry professions. According to a 2017 study by San Diego University’s Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, women make up around thirty percent of the population of people working in the documentary film industry, worldwide. In a separate study on the employment of women in indie films, the Center found that overall fewer woman directed independent films were screened at film festivals but that a higher percentage of woman directed documentary films were screened, at 8 films versus 13 documentary films directed by men. In a October 2015 Annenberg study, women documentarians in countries other than the U.S. were 40 percent likely to be “helmers” (in the top position) as opposed to 30 percent likely in the U.S. The study counted films with multiple countries involved “as other countries” but if the U.S. was involved it wasn’t counted as “other countries.”\n\nThe world of documentary film and the Oscars were criticized in 2016 by entertainment attorney Victoria Cook, who commented that there is a “misperception that the (feature) documentary category is more inclusive, less sexist and less racist than the other categories\" and noted that only two female documentary filmmakers have won Oscars in the documentary feature category in the last twenty years.\n\nPrior to the twentieth century women did work in documentary film and the major documentary movements, but their roles were typically limited to less visible ones such as research. German film director Leni Riefenstahl has been credited as pioneering the modern form of documentary film with her 1935 Nazi propaganda film \"Triumph of the Will\". Other women, such as Ruby Grierson and Frances H. Flaherty, have also been named as pioneers of the genre whose work and influence has been overshadowed by their male counterparts and relatives. The more modern documentary filmmakers Safi Faye and Trinh T. Minh-ha have also been cited as influences in the University of Illinois Press book \"Women and Experimental Filmmaking\", as they \"contribute to a tradition of experimental documentary filmmaking that avoids the objectifying, colonialist tendencies of much documentary and ethnography.\"\n\nIn China, the field of documentary filmmaking has been named as an emerging field that \"[provides] essential resources for women directors\". The creation of courses of study, documentary film festivals and television channels in Taiwan have helped encourage filmmakers and \"contributed to a new tide of Taiwan documentary filmmaking\", which in turn \"helped produce generations of women filmmakers concerned with representing feminist issues and the local cultures, customs, and history of Taiwan.\"\n"}
