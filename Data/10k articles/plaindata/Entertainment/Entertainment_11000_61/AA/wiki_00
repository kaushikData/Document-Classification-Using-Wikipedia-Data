This film, which takes its name from the Segway's average speed, documents Caldwell's 100-day, coast to coast journey across the United States riding the \"Human Transporter\". The trip started in Seattle, Washington on August 8, 2004 and ended in Boston, Massachusetts on November 18, 2004. \"10 MPH\" has had a favorable reaction at screenings and film festivals and has won several awards.\n\n\"10 MPH\" follows the progress of Caldwell as he rides a Segway scooter across the United States from Seattle to Boston, stopping at many places along the way to interact with people. The film focuses on showing the dynamic nature of the US countryside as well as documenting the stories of people Caldwell and Weeks encounter along the way.\n\n\"10 MPH\" shows Caldwell, Weeks, and other members of the crew but also provides footage of the people they meet, both helpful and rude. For example, Caldwell and the crew are stopped by an Illinois police officer who admonishes them for traveling at on a road with a speed limit. The filmmakers also document their struggles, from the technical challenges of maintaining the Segway's batteries to the production challenge of losing a producer part way through the filming process.\n\nDissatisfied with their average corporate jobs, filmmakers Weeks and Caldwell formed a production company, Spinning Blue, in Denver, Colorado prior to beginning production of \"10 MPH\". They have discussed their lack of training and experience in the film industry, lack of investment capital to make the film, and lack of film industry contacts as challenges at the beginning of the process. Rather than pursuing traditional channels of film making, Weeks and Caldwell used the Web to raise funds and promote \"10 MPH\". They conceived the idea of making a film before knowing what it would be about. Shortly thereafter, a friend gave them the idea of making a film involving a Segway.\n\nIn 2004, Weeks and Caldwell purchased a Segway and decided to film a documentary about traveling across the United States at . Caldwell actually rode the scooter while Weeks directed and managed the film footage. Weeks and other members of the production crew followed Caldwell in a car with the film equipment.\n\nThey used a Sony PD-150 to capture 180 hours of footage. Post-production occurred back in Denver after the Segway journey with involvement from other members of the Denver film community.\n\n\"10 MPH\" is available in several ways including on DVD, which premiered on May 29, 2007 in the United States and is available through Netflix and other outlets, and by direct download from the film Web site and from iTunes. Additionally, Weeks and Caldwell spent months in 2007 traveling back over their path to show the finished documentary in theaters along the way.\n\nThe documentary received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 80 percent based on reviews from five critics, with a rating average of 7.4 out of 10.\n\nIn \"Wired Magazine\", Dylan Tweney wrote that \"10 MPH\" “...is about more than just a couple of geeks with their high-tech toy: It's lighthearted and entertaining, with an overarching message about accomplishing your dreams and doing your ‘thing.’” Jeff Inglis of the \"Boston Phoenix\" compared it with other accounts of American road trips, writing; “What Caldwell and Weeks have made is a road movie, in the tradition, perhaps, of Charles Kuralt’s “On the Road” reports for CBS News, or maybe more like William Least Heat-Moon’s backroads peregrinations in Blue Highways.”\n\nThe documentary also received praise in the \"West Seattle Herald\", where Bruce Bulloch called Caldwell and Weeks “savvy storytellers” and applauded \"10 MPH\" for being a “witty counterpoint to the hyped-up rhythms of American life.” Bulloch further commented of \"10 MPH\", that despite its slow tempo “[it] has a seductive vitality about it – the last fit of reckless abandon of a disappearing youth.” Noting that while the popularity of documentaries has risen in recent years; “They're generally politically charged forays into the troubling issues of our times. ‘10 MPH’ heads off in another direction, taking us, regardless of age, on a sentimental journey to the cusp of adulthood when a sense of adventure was still an important virtue.”\n\nOf a more critical opinion, where \"The Christian Science Monitor\", which commented, “The duo's hook for a movie is to document their gimmicky journey from Seattle to Boston on a Segway scooter. We never truly get inside the heads of these unlikely pioneers but scenic photography and lively side characters make for a diverting trip.” On a similar note, Lisa Kennedy of the \"Denver Post\", reflected that “The narration can be a tad earnest. The aesthetic is decidedly DIY. Still, \"10 mph,\" with its wit, beckoning shots of splendid landscapes, and impromptu interviews, might have you humming Woody Guthrie, \"This land is your land, this land is my land\".”\n\nIn a favorable review in the \"Boise Weekly\", Travis Estvold wrote “Though piloting a Segway seems a bit gimmicky, it does what the filmmakers probably intended: It attracts plenty of attention. But it also does something that may not have been intentional: The voyage of the battery-powered machine takes a backseat to the personalities of the filmmakers and the characters they meet along the way.” In the review Estvold complemented the documentary makers for somehow capturing “every cross section of Americana as they ever-so-slowly wound their way from the home of the Space Needle to the city of Fenway Park.”\n\nIn an article on upcoming releases in 2007, the \"Boston Globe\" mentioned \"10 MPH\", calling it an “..amusingly offbeat documentary.” In the \"Idaho Statesman\", Chad Dryden remarked; “10 MPH succeeds on many levels. For one, it’s a terrific American travelogue, taking the viewer through small-town charm, purple mountain majesty and the big city’s vibrating pulse. More importantly, it’s an inspiring story about cutting through the stagnancy of 21st-century life to follow your dreams.”\n\nCalling the documentary “Charming and maddening”, Jordan Harper raised concerns with the main concepts of \"10 MPH\", writing in the \"Dallas Observer\", “...for good and ill: The American dream has been determined, and that dream is to become famous not for talent or beauty, but simply for doing something peculiar; if you can't be the American Idol, be one of those jackasses from the auditions. The guys seem nice enough, and there are plenty of sweet slices of Americana, so you might find yourself torn. It's hard not to be drawn in by the film's good-natured vibe, but there's no getting around the urge to smack these guys and tell them to make their next movie about anything except themselves.”\n\n\"10 MPH\" features artwork by the director's sister, Gannon Weeks, who also appeared in the film and performed public relations, logistics, and other duties. The soundtrack features artists such as Brett Dennen, Roman Candle and Daphne Loves Derby.\n\n"}
{"id": "38520874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38520874", "title": "140 (video game)", "text": "140 (video game)\n\n140 is a platform game independently developed by Jeppe Carlsen, known for his gameplay direction for Playdead's \"Limbo\". The game is described as a \"minimalistic platformer\", using electronic music to create synesthesia as the player makes his way through 4 different levels, each with their own soundtrack. The gameplay has been compared to other similar games which involve music synchronization like \"Sound Shapes\" and the \"Bit.Trip\" series, though with difficult platforming elements comparable to games in the \"Mega Man\" series. The game was released on Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux systems in October 2013, on Xbox One in August 2016, and on PlayStation 4 as well as on Wii U in September 2016. A release on Playstation Vita and Nintendo 3DS was planned, but later cancelled.\n\nAs described by Carlsen, \"140\" is \"an old school platformer\", but where the challenge is \"in syncing up your moves and jumps to the music-controlled elements\"; as the player progresses through a level, the music will change reflecting the difficulty of the platforming elements. The player controls a geometric shape - a square when stationary, a circle when moving, and a triangle when jumping, across a two-dimensional environment made up of other simple geometric shapes, with the object to reach the end of the course. Various obstacles and enemies, also represented by geometric shapes, test the player's skills, and should the shape fall or be hit by one of these, they will need to restart at the last checkpoint they passed. Many of these obstacles and enemies have actions that are synchronized to the music, aiding the player in moving through the course; platforms that appear and disappear will do so on the beat, while enemies will fire in time to the music.\n\n\"140\" was a project developed by Carlsen in his off-hours from Playdead. The idea originally grew out of Carlsen's attempt at an old school platformer, akin to \"Mega Man\", that involved throwing a ball that would travel in straight lines and bounce off walls to trigger effects. Carlsen also used the project to learn about the Unity game engine. As he started to add audio samples to the game, he found an interesting juxtaposition between the normal platform elements and the music, where the level would \"dance to the music\", and refocused the game towards its final form. Carlsen had worked on the title for about two years, and enlisted the help of Jakob Schmid, a college friend and fellow employee at Playdead, who created all music and sound for the game, and Niels Fyrst and Andreas Peiterson for art.\n\nCarlsen announced in April 2016 that Abstraction Games and Double Fine Presents were helping to port the game to the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Wii U, and Nintendo 3DS with a release planned in Q4 2016. The Xbox One version was released on August 30, 2016.\n\nThe game won the \"Excellence in Audio\" category for the 2013 Independent Games Festival awards, and was an honorary mention in the \"Technical Excellence\" category.\n\n\"Edge\" considered the game to initially appear in stark contrast to Carlsen's earlier \"Limbo\", but as the player progresses in the game, the various mechanics of \"140\" show similar traits to many of the puzzles and situations that Carlsen had developed for \"Limbo\". Ryan Cartmel of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4/5, calling it \"gaming minimalism done right.\" Derrick Sanskrit of The A.V. Club's Gameological Society called \"140\" \"a tightly paced and clever game of precise timing and jumping\" and praised its minimalist structure that allows the player to focus on the rhythm and gameplay.\n\n"}
{"id": "17761923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17761923", "title": "Antithetic parallelism", "text": "Antithetic parallelism\n\nAntithetic parallelism is a form of parallelism where the meaning of two or more excerpts of text are observed, although directly linked by providing the same meaning from differing perspectives. This type of parallelism is used in order to create repetition of meaning as a technique for cognitive reinforcement, thus more effectively communicating the meaning of the text.\n\nExamples of antithetic parallelism are found in Hebrew poetry, especially in Psalms of the Bible:\n\nThe young lions lack and suffer hunger;\n\nBut those who seek the LORD shall not lack any good thing. (Psalms 34:10)\n\nMore specifically, antithetical parallelism is defined as text where the meaning in the first part of the couplet contrasts with an opposite theme contained in the second part (see above). The use of opposites clarifies both extremes. In poetry the use of opposites can bring a sharper contrast to an image and provide a greater focus to the desired message. It is often marked by the use of the conjunction ‘but’, placed between two statements to juxtapose them and helps the reader or to view both the positive and negative perspectives of the text.\n\nAntithetic parallelism is not to be confused with 'synonymous' or 'synthetic' parallelism, which reflect repeated and expansive ideas respectively.\n\n"}

{"id": "55546274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55546274", "title": "Baby Shark", "text": "Baby Shark\n\n\"Baby Shark\" is a children's song about a family of sharks. It was popularized by social media and radio.\n\n\"Baby Shark\" started as a campfire song, where each member of a family of sharks is introduced with different hand motions. Different versions of the song have the sharks hunting fish, eating a sailor, or killing people who then go to heaven.\n\nThe dance version of \"Baby Shark\" was popularized online in a 2007 YouTube video named \"Kleiner Hai\" published by Alexandra Müller who is also known by her stage name alemuel. This version is set to the theme of \"Jaws\" and tells the story of a baby shark who grows up and eats a swimmer. The video gained popularity shortly after and was offered a record deal by the label EMI Müller, which published the song accompanied by disco beats on May 30, 2008. The single peaked at place 25 of the German charts and place 21 of the Austrian charts. Based on the single and the original video, the YouTube community created a popular music video which is a typical example of crowdsourcing. The German version of the song remains popular among German youth groups and multiple variations (also in different dialects of German ) have been published since it first gained popularity in 2007.\n\nThe \"Baby Shark\" song was popularized by a video produced by Pinkfong, an education brand under South Korean media startup SmartStudy, titled \"Baby Shark\" () released on November 25, 2015, which has garnered over 140 million views . This version of the song starts with bars from Antonín Dvořák's Symphony No. 9 which are reminiscent of music from the movie \"Jaws\". The song features a family of sharks which go hunt a school of fish which escape to safety. It became a viral video in Indonesia in 2017, and throughout the year it spread to many other Asian countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia. The mobile app was among the top 10 most downloaded in the family apps category in South Korea, Bangladesh, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia in 2017. , the dance version of the \"Baby Shark\" song, uploaded on June 17, 2016, has received over 2.0 billion views worldwide, making it the 29th most viewed video on YouTube.\n\nDue to its popularity, it has spurred an online dance craze (or referred to as \"Baby Shark Challenge\") around the world, while being cited as \"the next big thing after the domination of Gangnam Style\". K-pop groups including Girls' Generation, Twice, Red Velvet and Black Pink have been credited with further spreading the viral song through their coverage of the song and dance, specifically on their featured TV shows and concerts. The song began to go viral in the Western world in August 2018. In September 2018, Ellen DeGeneres released her own version of the song on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", and James Corden performed a version on \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\". The song was performed on \"The X Factor\" in early December 2018 because it was requested by Simon Cowell's four-year-old son Eric.\n\nWhile the English version just listed members of the shark family, the Korean version says Mommy Shark is \"pretty\", Daddy Shark is \"strong\", Grandma Shark is \"kind\" and Grandpa Shark is \"cool\". In January 2018, the South Korean newspaper \"Kyunghyang Shinmun\" published a front-page editorial condemning these lyrics as sexist. In May 2018, the Liberty Korea Party started using \"Baby Shark\" to promote its candidates, prompting SmartStudy to threaten legal action over copyright infringement.\n\nThe lyrics to another internet phenomenon song, \"Johnny Johnny Yes Papa\", has been mashed up with \"Baby Shark\".\n"}

Originally established as the Balkan Arts Center in 1968, CTMD assists the city's ethnic and immigrant communities in maintaining their traditions and cultural heritage. CTMD has developed a range of programs that emphasize research, documentation, collaboration, presentation, and education to help advance its mission of cultural equity. Over the past four decades, CTMD’s programs have led to the creation of nationally renowned ensembles, folk arts festivals, and community-based cultural organizations. CTMD provides the public with a full calendar of events designed to showcase and promote the diversity of New York City's performing arts traditions.\n\nIn 1968, towards the end of the North American Folk Music Revival and shortly after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was passed to replace the U.S. immigration quota system, Martin Koenig established the Balkan Arts Center in New York City to promote and foster an appreciation of Balkan dance traditions. Over the next few years Koenig, along with fellow New Yorker and folk music enthusiast Ethel Raim, also conducted fieldwork for Ralph Rinzler in an effort to scout artists and performers for the annual Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife (now known as the Smithsonian Folklife Festival). Raim eventually joined Koenig as co-director of the Balkan Arts Center in the mid-Seventies, around the same time as the establishment of the Folk Arts Program within the National Endowment for the Arts and the enactment of the American Folklife Preservation Act. With the financial support of the NEA, Koenig and Raim proceeded to build an organization that would focus exclusively on the music and dance traditions of New York City's immigrant and ethnic populations.\n\nOriginally promoting the arts of Albanian, Macedonian, and Greek cultures, the Balkan Arts Center expanded its operations into other communities as New York's demographic makeup shifted with each new influx of immigrants. Over the course of four decades and two name changes (the Ethnic Arts Center in 1981 and the Center for Traditional Music and Dance in 1997), CTMD has worked with dozens of ethnic and immigrant communities throughout the five boroughs.\n\nAccording to its current mission statement CTMD is a nonprofit organization \"dedicated to preserving and presenting the performing arts traditions of New York’s immigrant and ethnic communities through research-based educational programming, public performance, and community partnerships.\" Towards this end, CTMD has established and collaborated on a number of projects, including Community Cultural Initiatives (CCI), Sharing Traditions youth education programs, Touring Artist series, an extensive archive of audio and visual documents from over forty years of performances and events, the production of major festivals, the publication of printed materials, and the release of audio and visual recordings. These programs and projects are designed to advance the mission of cultural equity, a concept advanced by Alan Lomax in his appeal for the recognition of the right of every culture to promote and preserve its unique heritage and traditions.\n\nCommunity Cultural Initiatives\n\nAccording to the CTMD website, the Community Cultural Initiative (CCI) program is \"the Center’s most effective tool for advancing its mission of cultural equity – the right of every cultural group to express and sustain its distinctive cultural heritage.\" The multi-year CCI model places a strong emphasis on ethnographic fieldwork in New York City's ethnic and immigrant communities, collaboration with community members, documentation of events and artists, presentation of performing arts traditions to the wider public, and education in traditional music and dance for the youth. CCI programs are also designed to promote sustained interest in and financial support for the performing arts traditions of New York's diverse communities.\n\nCCI programs are generally structured in three phases occurring over the course of five years. The first phase, lasting approximately one year, consists of initial contacts with musicians and teachers, investigation and documentation of local performing arts traditions, the establishment of working relationships between CTMD and community members, and an assessment of available resources and pressing needs in the community. The middle phase of the CCI model, generally lasting three years, involves program development through ongoing collaboration between CTMD and local artists, teachers, and organizations. CCI programs conclude with a transition to ongoing and self-sustaining cultural activities within immigrant and ethnic communities, sometimes with the development of new or strengthened autonomous cultural organizations.\n\nCurrent CCI programs include work in the Chinese, Ukrainian, and Colombian communities, as well as the An-Sky Institute for Jewish Culture. Previous CCI programs have taken place in the Greek, Jewish, Italian, Irish, Puerto Rican, Albanian, Arab, Dominican, Asian-Indian, Indo-Caribbean, West African, Soviet Jewish, Filipino, Mexican, and Peruvian communities.\n\nSharing Traditions\n\nThe Sharing Traditions program began in the late 1990s as part of an effort to help foster awareness and appreciation among the youth of New York City's immigrant and ethnic communities for the traditional performing arts of their respective cultures. This program provides support for education in traditional music and dance, and has incorporated intensive classes and workshops for children in the Mountain Jewish, Bukharan Jewish, Indo-Caribbean, Mexican, Peruvian, Chinese, and Ukrainian communities. The Mariachi Academy of New York and Pachamama Peruvian Arts are two recent examples of successful organizations that evolved from Sharing Traditions programs.\n\nTouring Artists\n\nCTMD Touring Artists Program showcases performing arts ensembles from a variety of cultural traditions. Touring Artists works to bring these performers to stages across the United States in an effort to celebrate and cultivate awareness for the traditional performing arts.\n\nMasters on Stage: Major Concerts and Festivals\n\nCTMD presents both local and international artists each year through a variety of concerts, festivals, and workshops in New York City. These events include the Heritage Sunday Festival, produced in partnership with Lincoln Center Out of Doors, and the New York World Festival, produced in partnership with Central Park SummerStage, World Music Institute, and Lotus Music and Dance. The fourth New York World Festival planned for Fall of 2010 will feature musical performers from countries surrounding the Black Sea.\n\nPast events include:\nQueens Ethnic Music and Dance Festival (various communities, 1976–1991)\nGreek Festival (1976, 1982)\nDave Tarras Concert Series (Ashkenazic Jewish, 1978–1979)\nGreek Music Tour (1982–1983)\nMusic Around the Mediterranean Concert Series (1982)\nMusica Popolare Tour (Italian, 1983–1985)\nCherish the Ladies Concerts (1985) and Tour (1987–1989)\nJewish Music Tour (1980–1981)\nStatue of Liberty Centennial Salute to Immigrant Cultures (various, 1986)\nFiesta Navideña (Puerto Rican, 1987)\nFestival Shqiptar (Albanian, 1990-ongoing)\nRhythms of New York Festival (various, 1990–1993)\nFolk Parks (various communities, 1993–2000)\nShashmaqam Tour (Central Asian Jewish, 1993–1994)\nMaharajan al Fan Festival of Arab World Culture (1994–1998)\nDance India Festival (1996)\nBadenya Festival of Manden Culture in New York (West African, 1996–2000)\nQuisqueya en el Hudson Festival (Dominican, 1996-ongoing)\nKitchrie Festival (Indo-Caribbean with Rajkumari Cultural Center, 1997-Ongoing)\nNashii Traditsii Concerts (Former Soviet Jewish, 1998–2002)\nFilipino Music and Dance Festivals (1999–2003)\nSmithsonian Folklife Festival (curated for New York music, 2001)\nNew York World Festival (Mediterranean, 2002)\nGlobal Beat of the Boroughs Concert Series (various, 2004)\nNew York World Festival (Gulf Coast, 2004)\nCultural Villages (various, with Riverside Theater, 2006–2007)\nSizhu Silk and Bamboo Music Concert Series (Chinese, 2007)\nNew York World Festival (Mediterranean, 2007)\nLatin Fiesta!

This consortium of archival collections is designed to provide a research network of printed materials, audio and visual recordings, and related information on New York City's immigrant and ethnic communities, as well as the history of the performance of world music in New York.\n\nThe Archive of the Center for Traditional Music and Dance houses an extensive collection of audio and visual recordings, photographs, and printed materials documenting the Center's research and programming over the past four decades. The Archive contains recordings and printed materials from over five hundred events and nearly one thousand performing artists. The bulk of the collection has been digitized and will soon be accessible online to the public. Currently, access to the archive is available by special request.\n\nRecordings and Publications\n\nOver the years CTMD has published numerous audio recordings, films, concert videos, liner notes, and other print publications. Major recordings include the Ethnic Heritage Recording Series and the Global Beat of the Boroughs series, produced in collaboration with Smithsonian Folkways. A full list of recordings and publications is available on CTMD's website.\n\nGlobal Beat of the Boroughs\n\nGlobal Beat of the Boroughs is an electronic newsletter that provides information about CTMD-related events, artist profiles, and news from New York City's traditional music scene. The newsletter began in May 2007 and is currently published several times per year.\n\nFiscal Sponsorship/Technical Assistance\n\nCTMD provides a variety of services and training opportunities for artists, ensembles, and newly formed cultural organizations. These services include: accounting and book keeping services; artist management services; banking / financial support services; budgeting assistance; development/fund-raising; fiscal sponsorship for tax-deductible contributions; letters of support; mail and fax correspondence; tax form administration; project planning; promotion campaigns; stage production; strategic planning; website development.\n\nCenter for Art, Tradition, and Cultural Heritage (CATCH)\n\nThe Center for Art, Tradition, and Cultural Heritage is a joint project of CTMD, City Lore, World Music Institute, and Society for the Educational Arts. Still in its planning stages, CATCH is being designed as a major cultural center in New York for the presentation and preservation of the city's living cultural heritage. The facilities will include a theatre, gallery, library, music school, study center, cafe, gift shop, and an archive of historic images and recordings. CATCH will present concerts, theatrical productions, exhibitions, storytelling, and poetry presentations.

The selections range from art house fare to wide release films and cult classics (also see midnight movies for a similar practice).\n\nBeginning in the 1950s and 60's, classes in cinema theory and history began to be taught at colleges across the United States. To facilitate the growing interest in film, prints were screened for a reduced price for students. Several movies have been salvaged thanks to this practice, including most notably Citizen Kane.\n\nSome of the movies popular on college circuits throughout the years have been either controversial or of specious artistic merit. The content of the movies often appeal to college-age sensibilities. Critics like Roger Ebert have expressed suspicion of such films when deemed \"artistic\", and instead charges them as misleading by presenting exploitive material (such as sex, violence, and drug use) by means that are more aesthetically pleasing to those educated in cinema studies than say, a grindhouse film, and therefore they become more acceptable to an \"intellectual audience\". This is an argument sometimes leveled against Blue Velvet or the ouvre of Ken Russell. Often the films are of no discernible artistic merit at all, but instead appeal to the culture of college life, such as in the case of the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour.\n\n"}

It was released on January 26, 2018, by Capitol Records, Motown and Quality Control Music. The album features guest appearances from 21 Savage, Drake, Gucci Mane, Travis Scott, Ty Dolla Sign, Big Sean, Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, Post Malone and 2 Chainz. The album was executive produced by Quavo, alongside production work from a variety of collaborators including Metro Boomin, Buddah Bless, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams and Murda Beatz, among others. It serves as a sequel to Migos' previous album, \"Culture\".\n\n\"Culture II\" was supported by four singles: \"MotorSport\", \"Stir Fry\", \"Walk It Talk It\" and \"Narcos\", as well as the promotional single, \"Supastars\". The album received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200. It is Migos' second US number-one album.\n\nIn July 2017, a rumor surfaced that \"Culture II\" was on a hard drive that was lost by Quavo. Migos confirmed that a single from the album will be dropping soon and was previewed on \"Rap-Up\". Anticipation regarding the upcoming album built due to the Atlanta rap group's use of social media. Posts included many names such as Kanye West, Donald Glover and others who they have worked with, and revealed on January 22 that West helped produce the album.\n\nIn a November 21, 2017, \"The New York Times\" story on the group, it was revealed that the updated release date for the album was January 2018; earlier reports suggested an October release. Quavo announced on January 8 that he and DJ Durel were mixing the album. On January 15, 2018, Migos announced the release date of January 26 via their official social media accounts. The same day, Quavo posted a snippet of the song \"Culture National Anthem\". Merchandise for the album has been released within Bloomingdale's 'Music Is Universal' pop-up space in conjunction with Universal Music Group.\n\nMigos' DJ known as DJ Durel says that group only spend 20 to 45 minutes to do each song. He also stated \"when they're in the zone, there's no way you can stop them from laying down a good song. It's going to come out perfect. It's not going to come out rushed or anything.\"\n\nThe album's lead single, \"MotorSport\", was released on October 27, 2017, and includes lead vocals from Cardi B and Nicki Minaj. The song is produced by Murda Beatz and Cubeatz. It was originally previewed at Powerhouse 2017 the night before release. The song peaked at number six on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe album's second single, \"Stir Fry\", was released on December 20, 2017. The song is produced by Pharrell Williams. It peaked at number eight on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe album's third single, \"Walk It Talk It\" featuring Drake, was sent to urban contemporary radio on March 18, 2018, the same day as the release of the official music video. The song peaked at number 10 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe music video for the song, \"Narcos\", was released on June 27, 2018. It was later sent to US rhythmic contemporary radio on July 24, 2018, as the album's fourth single. The song initially peaked at number 36 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\n\"Supastars\" was released as a promotional single on January 22, 2018, shortly after premiering on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio. The song is produced by Honorable C.N.O.T.E., Buddah Bless, Quavo and DJ Durel. It peaked at number 53 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\n\"Culture II\" received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on 19 reviews. Dave Heaton of \"PopMatters\" praised the album saying, \"While not all of these 24 songs are equally impressive, nothing about \"Culture II\" feels like they're going through the motions.\" Jordan Bassett of \"NME\" said, \"Migos are firing on all cylinders here, their new record a lush, chaotic patchwork that pops with primary colours. The fab three have done it again.\" Alex Petridis of \"The Guardian\" stated that \"for such a gargantuan album, it's surprisingly light on its feet, skipping nimbly between musical styles\", complimenting the album's production, but criticising the lyrical themes. Dan Weiss of \"Consequence of Sound\" said, \"The trio gave a double album their best, with plenty of head-turning lines, hilarious stray shouts (\"dinner rolls!\" on \"CC\" is a fave), and productions that further dilate the luxury trap spectrum, but not wildly so.\" In his review, Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic states, \"With enough highlights to form a single digestible effort, Migos could have delivered another culture-defining classic with just a little trimming. Instead, they've taken what should have been a potent, big league statement and diluted it.\" Meaghan Garvey of \"Pitchfork\" said, \"It's still a joy to hear the Migos rap, which is why it's especially depressing that \"Culture II\" ultimately feels like a drag—a formless grab bag compiled without much care.\" Scott Glaysher of \"XXL\" said, \"Although the creative achievements aren't revolutionary, they are thorough and consistent.\"\n\nIn a mixed review, \"Rolling Stone\"s Charles Aaron stated: \"\"Culture II\" ultimately feels less like a celebratory howl from the mountaintop than a transitional inventory dump. With its easily-trimmable 24 tracks, \"Culture II\" appears to be tailored to finesse chart rules, which count 1,500 individual song streams toward one full album sale.\" In another mixed review, \"Exclaim!\"s Calum Slingerland stated: \"Having more songs available to stream results in more royalties, though it doesn't equate to a flawless full-length.\" Kitty Empire of \"The Observer\" said, \"\"Culture II\" was never going to be a modest affair, in which three self-effacing twentysomethings quietly enumerated their blessings. Apart from some anxiety (\"Tryna be like the Carters/Gotta be like the Carters\" – Too Playa) and exhaustion (Work Hard), \"Culture II\" is wall-to-wall diamonds, watches, cars, chains, brands, fashion houses and exotic fauna.\" Arcade of Sputnikmusic saying \"\"Culture II\" sounds like a satire of every other rap album released by a major label these days, catering to the lowest common denominator of casual music listener. As a business decision, it's genius; as a piece of music, it's little more than an elaborate consumer scam.\"\n\n\"Culture II\" debuted at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 with 199,000 album-equivalent units, of which 38,000 were pure album sales in its first week. It is Migos' second US number-one album. On May 10, 2018, \"Culture II\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of a million units.\n\nCredits were adapted from the album's liner notes and Tidal.\n\nNotes\n\nSamples\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes and Tidal.\n\nMusicians\n\nTechnical\nAdditional personnel\n"}
{"id": "1630381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1630381", "title": "Dai Vernon", "text": "Dai Vernon\n\nDai Vernon (pronounced alternatively as DIE or as DAY as in David) (June 11, 1894 – August 21, 1992), a.k.a. The Professor, was a Canadian magician. His expert sleight of hand technique and extensive knowledge, particularly with card tricks and close-up magic, garnered him respect among fellow magicians. His influence was considerable in the magic world of the 20th Century, and he was a mentor to numerous famous magicians. He lived out his last years at the Magic Castle, a nightclub in Hollywood, California.\n\nVernon was born in Ottawa as David Frederick Wingfield Verner. While performing, he often mentioned that he had learned his first trick from his father at age seven, adding wryly that he had \"wasted the first 6 years\" of his life. His father was a government worker and an amateur magician. Vernon studied mechanical engineering at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, but by World War I he had moved to New York City.\n\nVernon first fell in love with magic when he was seven years old after his father took him to see a magic show. The first real magic book he ever owned was an early edition of perhaps the most famous card book of them all, \"The Expert at the Card Table\", by S. W. Erdnase. By the time he was 13 he had memorized the contents of the book. He also had a famous encounter with another up-and-coming young magician from his town, Cliff Green, who asked Vernon, \"What kind of magic do you do?\" Vernon responded by asking the boy to name a card. Upon pulling a pack of cards from his pocket, Vernon turned over the top card of the deck to reveal the named card and replied to the speechless Green \"That's the kind of magic I do. What kind of magic do you do?\"\n\nAs a young man, Vernon moved to New York where, in the back room of Clyde Powers' magic shop, he found favor among many of the great magicians of the era, including Dr. James William Elliott and Harry Kellar.\n\nHe began to use the first name \"Dai\" after a newspaper used the name in place of \"David\"; the paper actually was using the Welsh nickname for David. When Verner first moved to the United States, the male member of a popular ice-skating pair had the surname Vernon; Americans continually mistook Verner's last name to be the same as the popular ice skater, and eventually the magician became fed up with correcting people and simply adopted \"Vernon\" as well.\n\nOwing to his extraordinary knowledge of, and skill at, sleight of hand, Vernon has long been affectionately known as \"The Professor\". Harry Houdini (who in his early years billed himself as \"The King of Kards\") often boasted that if he saw a card trick performed three times in a row he would be able to figure it out. Vernon then showed Houdini a trick where he removed the top card of the deck and placed it second from the top, then turned over the top card to again reveal the original card. Houdini watched Vernon do the trick seven times, each time insisting that Vernon \"do it again.\" Finally, Houdini's wife and Vernon's friends said, \"Face it, Houdini, you're fooled.\" For years afterward, Vernon used the title \"The Man Who Fooled Houdini\" in his advertisements.\n\nThough respected by professional magicians nationwide due in part to publicity via the magazine \"The Sphinx\", Vernon was essentially a gifted amateur until his 40s. Before the Magic Castle, Vernon never held a steady full-time job for more than a few months. He occasionally performed magic at nightclubs or on cruise ships to South America and back, and also toured the Philippines as an entertainer during WW2 with the United Service Organizations. His engineering degree was put to use as a sometime blueprint reader. However, Vernon's main source of income was cutting custom silhouette portraits, a talent that paid 25 to 50 cents per silhouette for about two minutes work during the 1920s and '30s. A few hours a week cutting silhouettes was generally enough to support his family and finance his sleight of hand hobby (compare his silhouette fee with the first US minimum wage of 25 cents per hour in 1938). Vernon spent most of his early life traveling all over the United States of America looking for card cheats, and anyone who might know anything about sleight-of-hand with cards. He was famously under-credited for much of the work published in Jean Hugard and Frederick Braue's \"Expert Card Technique\", though a later edition included an extra chapter which acknowledges Vernon's contributions. In fact, a huge portion of the sleight-of-hand had been discovered by Vernon over years of searching.\n\nAmong magicians, he is credited with inventing or improving many standard close-up effects with cards, coins, and other small items. The \"standard\" Cups and balls routine is his, and his 6-ring \"Symphony of the Rings\" remains one of the most popular Chinese linking rings routines in use to this day.\n\nVernon spent the last thirty years of his life as Magician-in-Residence and star attraction at The Magic Castle in Los Angeles, California. There he mentored numerous well-known magicians including Ricky Jay, Persi Diaconis, Doug Henning, Larry Jennings, Bruce Cervon, Michael Ammar and John Carney.\n\nIn 1924, Vernon married Eugenie \"Jeanne\" Hayes, a diminutive magician's assistant. They would have two sons, Theodore and Derek. Jeanne eventually tired of Dai's wanderlust, spendthrift money habits, and obsession with card tricks, and the couple lived separately by the 1950s. They never formally divorced.\n\nHe died on August 21, 1992, in Ramona, County of San Diego, California. He was cremated, and his ashes are interred at the Magic Castle.\n\n\nIn November 2005, Karl Johnson wrote \"The Magician And The Cardsharp\" about Vernon's early days of tracking down a specific yet unknown cardsharp, who developed an undetectable false deal.\n\nIn June 2006, the first in-depth biography of Vernon was released by Squash Publishing entitled \"Dai Vernon: A Biography, *Artist * Magician * Muse (Vol. 1: 1894-1941)\" (first of planned two volumes) written by Canadian magician David Ben.\n\nA 1999 documentary was released entitled \"Dai Vernon: The Spirit Of Magic\".\n\nThe character of \"The Professor\" (played by Hal Holbrook) from the movie \"Shade\" was based on Dai Vernon, and the character Vernon (Stuart Townsend) was named after him.\n\n"}
{"id": "2055366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055366", "title": "Dracula's Daughter", "text": "Dracula's Daughter\n\nDracula's Daughter is a 1936 American vampire horror film produced by Universal Pictures as a sequel to the 1931 film \"Dracula\". Directed by Lambert Hillyer from a screenplay by Garrett Fort, the film stars Otto Kruger, Gloria Holden in the title role, Marguerite Churchill and features, as the only cast member to return from the original, Edward Van Sloan – although his character's name was altered from Van Helsing to \"Von\" Helsing.\n\n\"Dracula's Daughter\" tells the story of Countess Marya Zaleska, the daughter of Count Dracula and herself a vampire. Following Dracula's death, she believes that by destroying his body she will be free of his influence and live normally. When this fails, she turns to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger). He, in turn, has a fiance, Janet (Marguerite Churchill). The Countess kidnaps Janet and takes her to Transylvania, leading to a battle between Dr. Garth and the Countess in an attempt by him to save Janet. \n\nOstensibly based on a short story titled \"Dracula's Guest\" by Bram Stoker, the film bears little or no resemblance to the original source material. David O. Selznick initially purchased the rights to the story for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Selznick, likely knowing he could not legally make the film because of Universal's copyright on the original film, sold the rights to Universal. After first assigning the picture to James Whale, Universal production head Carl Laemmle, Jr. finally put Hillyer in the director's chair.\n\nWhile not as successful as the original upon its release, the film was generally well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Contemporary critics and scholars have noted the film's strong lesbian overtones, which Universal acknowledged from the start of production and exploited in some early advertising. Universal completed their initial \"Dracula\" trilogy in 1943 with \"Son of Dracula\".\n\n\"Dracula's Daughter\" begins a few moments after \"Dracula\" ends. Count Dracula has just been destroyed by Professor Von Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). Von Helsing is taken by police to Scotland Yard, where he explains that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because he had already been dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of hiring a lawyer, he enlists the aid of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger), who was once one of his star students.\n\nMeanwhile, Dracula's daughter, Countess Marya Zaleska (Gloria Holden), with the aid of her manservant, Sandor (Irving Pichel), steals Dracula's body from Scotland Yard and ritualistically burns it, hoping to break her curse of vampirism. However, Sandor soon begins to discourage her telling her that all that is in her eyes is \"death.\" She soon gives into her thirst for blood. The Countess resumes her hunting, mesmerizing her victims with her exotic jeweled ring. After a chance meeting with Dr. Garth at a society party, the Countess asks him to help her overcome the influence she feels from beyond the grave. The doctor advises her to defeat her cravings by confronting them and the Countess becomes hopeful that her will, plus Dr. Garth's science, will be strong enough to overcome Dracula's malevolence.\n\nThe Countess sends Sandor to fetch her a model to paint; he returns with Lili (Nan Grey). Countess Zaleska initially resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her. Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth know that it was Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. The Countess gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth to Transylvania by kidnapping Janet (Marguerite Churchill), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he can be transformed, Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal. He takes aim at Dr. Garth but is shot dead by a Scotland Yard policeman who, along with Von Helsing, have followed Dr. Garth from London.\n\n\nUniversal originally did not hold the rights to \"Dracula's Guest\", a chapter excised from Bram Stoker's original novel and the purported source material for the film. The story includes an encounter between a man (presumed by some to be Jonathan Harker although the character is not identified as such) and a female vampire. The story does not establish a filial relationship between the female vampire and Dracula. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer executive David O. Selznick negotiated a contract in 1933 with Stoker's widow, Florence, to buy the rights to the chapter for an advance of $500 against a purchase price of $5,000. MGM's lawyers and executives were worried about the use of the word \"Dracula\" in the film's title, fearing that Universal would take legal action, although Selznick's contract with Stoker explicitly listed \"Dracula's Daughter\" as a possible alternate title. The project was code-named \"Tarantula\" in correspondence.\n\nSelznick hired John L. Balderston, who had previously worked on the 1931 \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\", to write the screenplay. Balderston's screenplay involved tying up loose ends from the original film. In it, Von Helsing returns to Transylvania to destroy the three vampire brides seen in \"Dracula\" but overlooks a fourth tomb concealing Dracula's daughter. She follows him back to London and operates under the name \"Countess Szekelsky\". She attacks a young aristocrat and Von Helsing and the aristocrat's fiancée track her back to Transylvania and destroy her. The script included scenes that implied that Dracula's daughter enjoyed torturing her male victims and that while under her control the men liked it too. Also included were shots of the Countess's chambers being stocked with whips and straps, which she would never use on-screen but whose uses the audience could imagine. Regardless of any objections that the Production Code Administration (PCA) would have raised to many aspects of the scenario, Balderston's script could never have been filmed because Selznick's contract with Stoker expressly barred him from using any Bram Stoker characters that did not appear in \"Dracula's Guest\". Selznick re-sold the rights to \"Dracula's Guest\" to Universal in September 1935 for $12,500, which included the rights to Balderston's scenario. Horror film scholar David J. Skal theorizes that this was Selznick's actual motivation in buying the rights in the first place, to profit from Universal's desire for a sequel by tying up the only obvious source material.\n\nUniversal studio head Carl Laemmle, Jr. (nicknamed \"Junior\") wanted James Whale, fresh from his great success with \"Bride of Frankenstein\", to direct \"Dracula's Daughter\". Whale was idle, waiting for Irene Dunne to finish work on \"Magnificent Obsession\" so she could begin work on Whale's \"Show Boat\". Wary of directing two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called \"The Hangover Murders\". Laemmle agreed only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct \"Dracula's Daughter\" next. Whale completed work on the film, titled \"Remember Last Night?\" for release, on September 14, 1935. \"Magnificent Obsession\" completed filming on October 29. With Dunne freed up, Whale went to work on \"Show Boat\". Laemmle replaced him with A. Edward Sutherland, who was best known for his work on comedies. Sutherland had as little interest in \"Dracula's Daughter\" as Whale and soon left the studio, and Hillyer came on to direct.\n\nThe earliest scenario for the Universal film was written by R. C. Sherriff. It began with three scenes set in the 14th Century and centered on the Dracula legend. It then switched to the present day, focusing on two engaged couples who visit Transylvania. The men explore the ruins of Dracula's castle. One is later found, insane, and the other goes missing. Professor Von Helsing is summoned and he tracks the missing man to London, where he is in thrall to Dracula's daughter, the Countess Szelinski (sic). When she attempts to flee with her thrall to the Orient by ship, Von Helsing and three others book passage on the same ship. During a violent storm, Von Helsing destroys Dracula's daughter and, with her hold over the men broken, the scenario closes with a double wedding. This version was submitted on August 28, 1935 to the British Board of Film Censors, which rejected it, saying in part \"... \"Dracula's Daughter\" would require half a dozen ... languages to adequately express its beastliness.\" On September 10 Sherriff met with BBFC representatives and submitted a revised scenario two days later. This scenario was passed but because its details were not recorded by the BBFC it is unknown how much it differed from the original or how much if any of that scenario was retained in the final script.\n\nUniversal also submitted Sheriff's first draft to the PCA on September 5, 1935 and encountered stronger resistance from PCA enforcer Joseph Breen than it had from the British. Breen reported back that the script \"contains countless offensive stuff which makes the picture utterly impossible for approval under the Production Code.\" A second draft was submitted on October 21, but it too was rejected, with many of Breen's objections centering on the 14th Century scenes in which Dracula himself appeared. It is unclear whether this submission was the same submission that the BBFC had previously passed. A third Sheriff draft was submitted on October 24 and Sherriff's fourth and final draft on November 10. All remained unacceptable, and Whale biographer James Curtis suggests that Whale, who had no interest in the project and feared that his commitment to it might cost him control over the filming of \"Show Boat\", encouraged Sherriff to submit ever more wildly unacceptable versions in hopes of getting himself off the film. On January 14, 1936, producer E. M. Asher advised Breen that the Sherriff script was not going to be used and that a new script would be put together from scratch. Screenwriting duties were assigned to Garrett Fort.\n\n\"Dracula's Daughter\" was Gloria Holden's first starring role and reportedly she was extremely displeased at having been assigned it. Like many actors, Holden looked down on horror films. She had also seen Bela Lugosi struggle over the years since \"Dracula\" was made to free himself from typecasting and feared that the role would lead to the same fate for her. Critic Mark Clark believes that ironically it may have been Holden's disgust for the role that led to the quality of her performance. \"Her disdain for the part translates into a kind of self-loathing that perfectly suits her troubled character.\"\n\nInitially Lugosi and Jane Wyatt were set to star in the film. Universal also announced that Boris Karloff and Colin Clive, who had starred together in \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein\", would appear, and that Cesar Romero would play Dr. Garth. According to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Universal had sought Herbert Marshall for the role of Sandor, before casting Pichel. None of them appeared except, after a fashion, Lugosi, in the form of a wax bust molded in his image for use in Dracula's coffin. Some sources report that Lugosi was paid as much as $4,000 for his abortive involvement, but the only confirmed record of any financial arrangement is a letter in which Lugosi consents to the use of his likeness at no cost to create the wax bust.\n\nShooting on \"Dracula's Daughter\" began on February 4, 1936, rushed into production before Fort had completed the script, because of a deadline clause in Universal's option of the property from Selznick. The script was not finalized until shooting had been underway for three weeks. The film was completed on March 10, 1936. Despite studio orders that the film be shot on a seven-day-per-week schedule, filming ran seven days over its schedule and $50,000 over budget, with the final cost of the film tallied at $278,380.\n\n\"Dracula's Daughter\" was the last in the first cycle of Universal Horror films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal said it was because a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate. In truth, the cycle was suspended because, just before filming on \"Dracula's Daughter\" had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and from Charles R. Rogers. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4, 1936 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of \"Dracula's Daughter\" to focus on fare like Deanna Durbin musicals. Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released \"Son of Frankenstein\" in 1939.\n\nMakeup artist Jack Pierce and special effects supervisor John P. Fulton worked together closely, especially on Holden's make-up design. They combined special lighting with a greyish-green make-up for Holden's final scenes, creating a pallor that contrasted with the more normally flesh-toned make-ups of the others in the scene. Heinz Roemheld composed the score and Albert S. D'Agostino redressed Charles D. Hall's set of Dracula's castle and created new sets including a London bridge, the moor where Dracula's body is burned and Countess Zaleska's apartment.\n\n\"The New York Times\" gave \"Dracula's Daughter\" a solid, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, review upon its release, citing the film's \"blood-curdling events\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden is a remarkably convincing bat-woman\" in concluding that the film is both \"quite terrifying\" and \"a cute little horror picture.\" \"Variety\" also praised the production and Holden's performance in particular. Despite critical approval, \"Dracula's Daughter\" did not have the same box office success as the original.\n\nLater reviews of \"Dracula's Daughter\" are sharply split. \"Entertainment Weekly\", reviewing the film following its video release, called it \"one of the most satisfying vampire pictures ever made\". Describing director Hillyer's visuals as \"lush, evocative, and suffused with just the right gothic chiaroscuro\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden, as the reluctant vampire protagonist, absolutely drips patrician eroticism\", \"EW\" concludes that this film is better than Lugosi's original \"Dracula\".\n\nRyan Cracknell of Apollo Movie Guide, while echoing the praise for Holden's performance, nonetheless found that the film \"doesn't hold up so well today\". Citing what he sees as slow pacing and \"long bouts of over-the-top dialogue\", Cracknell compares the film to \"reading a textbook – not the most exciting thing in the world, but it does provide insights into and perspectives on the foundation of early horror movies and how many similarities carry over into movies half a century and more later.\" Michael W. Phillips, Jr. concurs, calling the film \"a marked improvement on the original film [but] still a bit of a snooze, relying too much on forced comedy and not enough on suspense or fright.\" Phillips again praises Holden's performance and also Pichel's portrayal of Sandor, but finds the rest of the cast weak.\n\nHorror author Anne Rice has named \"Dracula's Daughter\" as a direct inspiration for her own homoerotic vampire fiction. She named a bar in her novel \"Queen of the Damned\" \"Dracula's Daughter\" in honor of the film. Author Ramsey Campbell, under the pseudonym \"Carl Dreadstone\", wrote a novelization of the film also entitled \"Dracula's Daughter\" that was published in 1977. A juvenile fiction version, written by Carl R. Green, William R. Sanford and Howard Schroeder, was published in 1985. Some observers have suggested that the film served as an inspiration for \"Sunset Blvd.\", noting similarities between the outlines of each film. Michael Almereyda's 1994 film \"Nadja\" has been described as an \"unofficial remake\" of \"Dracula's Daughter\".\n\nThe lesbian vampire has been a trend in literature dating back to Joseph Sheridan le Fanu's 1872 novella \"Carmilla\". \"Dracula's Daughter\" marked the first time that the trend was incorporated into a film. The lesbian implications of \"Dracula's Daughter\" were obvious from the start and were of great concern to the Production Code Administration. PCA head Breen took special notice of the scene between the Countess and her model, Lili, writing, \"This will need very careful handling to avoid any questionable flavor.\" The day before the scene was to be shot, Universal's Harry Zehner asked Breen to read a draft of the scene. In response, Breen wrote: \n\nThe present suggestion that ... Lili poses in the nude will be changed. She will be posing her neck and shoulders, and there will be no suggestion that she undresses, and there will be no exposure of her person. It was also stated that the present incomplete sequence will be followed by a scene in which Lili is taken to a hospital and there it will be definitely established that she has been attacked by a vampire. The whole sequence will be treated in such a way as to avoid any suggestion of perverse sexual desire on the part of Marya or of an attempted sexual attack by her upon Lili.\n\nGay film historian Vito Russo noted in his book \"The Celluloid Closet\" that Universal highlighted Countess Zaleska's attraction to women in some of its original advertising for the film, using the tag line \"Save the women of London from Dracula's Daughter!\" He further cited Countess Zaleska as an example of the presentation of the \"essence of homosexuality as a predatory weakness\". Some reviewers of the day picked up on and condemned the lesbian content, including the \"New York World-Telegram\" which noted the Countess's tendency to wander around \"giving the eye to sweet young girls\". Other reviews missed it entirely, including the aforementioned \"The New York Times\" which advised \"Be sure to bring the kiddies.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" describes the encounter between the Countess and Lili as \"so hot it's impossible to imagine how it ever got past '30s censors\" whereas \"Time Out London\" finds only a \"subtle suggestion\" of lesbianism. Horror scholar Skal notes that the scene has come to be seen as a \"classic 'lesbian' sequence, although of a decidedly negative stripe\". The scene between Countess Zaleska and Lili was included in the 1995 documentary film adaptation of Russo's book.\n\nAnother lesbian-tinged scene which has received less critical attention comes when the Countess is holding Janet captive. Described as \"the longest kiss never filmed\", Countess Zaleska \"hovers lovingly over Janet ... hovers ... and hovers ... slowly descending to kiss the recumbent Janet ...\" until interrupted by the arrival of Dr. Garth.\n\n\"Bright Lights Film Journal\", after noting that \"Gloria Holden in the title role almost singlehandedly redefined the '20s movie vamp as an impressive Euro-butch dyke bloodsucker\", draws an implicit comparison between Countess Zaleska's seeking to cure her vampirism through psychiatry and the former position of mainstream psychiatry of homosexuality as a mental illness (a view still held by a minority in the profession). Zaleska's cruising the streets of London is seen as parallel to cruising for sex (although that tends to be a gay male activity) and as suggesting \"society's image of the lesbian as soulless predator\" but the conclusion is that \"Holden's striking, masklike face and haunting, luminous eyes [are] the intoxicating essence of transgressive lesbian power.\"\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "2912346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2912346", "title": "Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix", "text": "Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix\n\nFear Effect 2: Retro Helix is an action-adventure game developed by Kronos Digital Entertainment and published by Eidos Interactive for the PlayStation. It is the prequel to \"Fear Effect\".\n\n\"Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix\" begins in Hong Kong in the year 2048. The player delves into the colorful histories of the original cast of three mercenaries - and newcomer Rain Qin - as well as the extraordinary circumstances that brought them together. In the wake of a degenerative global pandemic called EINDS (Environmentally Induced Nucleotides Degeneration Syndrome – pronounced \"ends\"), theft, murder, and terrorism have become big business.\n\nHana Tsu-Vachel and Rain Qin are freelance operatives, Royce Glas is a washed-up former soldier, and Jacob \"Deke\" Decourt is a cutthroat assassin. Much of the game's intrigue lies in how these unlikely allies even manage to come together for one cause. From the start, each of them have their own motives, but they soon all become entangled in a sinister plot extending far beyond politics, espionage, or personal survival. The adventure takes players through a futuristic Hong Kong, the formidable walled city of Xi'an, the lost tomb of the first emperor of China, and, finally, into the mountain island of the immortals, Penglai Shan.\n\nLike the original \"Fear Effect\", the sequel features cel-shaded character models on top of pseudo-3D environments that use looping full-motion video to give the appearance of constantly animated background elements. Players take control of each of the four main characters (Hana, Rain, Deke and Glas) at different times throughout the game, which enables multilateral perspective on the storyline.\n\nRetro Helix mostly relies on a third-person perspective. The controls are mapped without regard to the character's current position or direction faced. Unlike the original Fear Effect, however, Retro Helix offers players the option of a more traditional control scheme. At the player's disposal is a small arsenal of weapons, including a variety of firearms – including pistols, shotguns, and assault rifles, specialty equipment such as a hand-held EMPs and a taser, and one unique melee weapon for each character.\n\n\"Fear Effect 2\" is primarily focused on solving puzzles to progress rather than combating enemies. In spite of the heavy ordnance available, enemies are few and far between, with static – as opposed to dynamic – placement. The gameplay is intended to evoke tension and suspense, rather than relying on the nonstop action formula of standard shooters. This format has the consequence of making the gameplay arguably less difficult, although it is offset by the relative ease at which characters can die from enemy attacks and a number of instant-death scenarios. The fear gauge present in the original game returns for Retro Helix, a variation on the health meter common to most action games.\n\n\"Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix\" received \"favorable\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nAn unreleased third game entitled \"Fear Effect Inferno\" was originally announced for the PlayStation 2 as a sequel to the first game \"Fear Effect\" with Kronos Digital Entertainment developing it and Eidos Interactive publishing it at the time. The first trailer was released during E3 2002. The trailer depicted some of the only known footage of the game.\n\nWhile story details have been scarce, IGN editors promised that \"the fusion [of] Asian myth and freaky modern themes\" would be prominent like the previous two titles. Through the few demonstration clips that Kronos released during the game's development, fans have pieced together a portion of the game's plot.\n\n\"Fear Effect Inferno\" is based on the best ending the player could achieve in the first game \"Fear Effect\". Therefore, the demons set forth by Jin have been killed, Glas' arm has been \"reattached,\" and Deke's body and soul have been restored. According to the videos, \"Fear Effect Inferno\"s story chronicled Hana's capture by a group of demons disguised as human doctors and nurses. Hana is placed in an asylum where tests are performed on her. During this time, she has several hallucinations, which range from Hana's completion of ancient tasks to her friends, including Hana herself, getting slaughtered by beasts. As she completed more challenges, Hana gained power from these ancient beings, allowing her to escape the grasp of the asylum's demons and experiments. Meanwhile, Deke is working from the inside, possibly as a \"patient,\" killing any and all individuals that get in his way while searching for Hana. By the end of the journey, the four bounty hunters would once again face the fires of Hell, and fight the remaining demons Besides the demons themselves, their previously-human experiments, henchmen with sunglasses, and a woman that vaguely resembles Wee Ming, no \"main enemy\" was ever highlighted. However, \"Fear Effect Inferno\" promised more characterization during the course of the adventure.\n\nMany drastic changes to the characters were expected to take place during the events of \"Fear Effect Inferno\". As the trailers and demonstration clips explained, Glas and Rain would begin a sexual relationship. At the same time, Hana and Glas would develop closer bonds, which would have created a love triangle for the three bounty hunters. The fates of the characters themselves are unknown; it was never revealed if any of the deaths witnessed by Hana or the player would be permanent.\n\nOnly a few screenshots exist that hint at the gameplay style of \"Inferno\". Based on these images, it was concluded that the gameplay would have been nearly identical to the previous two games. However, a new weapon system would have allowed players to map a firearm to the \"X\" (Cross) button and another to the \"O\" (Circle) button on the DualShock 2 controller. This would have allowed numerous weapon combinations. In addition, updated diving moves could be executed to quickly evade enemy fire. The environment itself would have allowed players to hide from hazards, such as bullets, and function as a way to avoid detection. It was rumored that players could control certain actions during scripted in-game fight scenes, requiring the player to execute timed button combinations to fight certain opponents. \"Inferno\" would have introduced the separation of the \"Health\" and \"Fear\" Meters. However, it is not known how the \"Fear\" Meter would have affected gameplay since it functioned as both in the previous two titles.\n\nGraphically, \"Inferno\" would have resembled the previous two titles with a \"next-gen facelift.\" Using the PlayStation 2's graphical capabilities, pre-rendered scenes, which would have shown the characters talking and performing more animation-intensive actions, would have been rendered at a higher resolution. Like the previous two games, the background environments would have been short, pre-rendered animations, using a technique utilized by some portions of \"Final Fantasy X\". The polygonal characters would have been rendered using a cel-shaded method similar to the ones used in the previous two \"Fear Effect\" titles for the PlayStation. Other gimmicks, such as Hana frequently changing clothes, would have been prominent in the game, as well; in the existing clips alone, Hana dons no fewer than 4 different outfits.\n\nThe game's status changed rapidly towards the end of 2002 and was finally cancelled in 2003. However, between the announcement and the cancellation, information was scarce.\n\nReports varied as to the status of the game between 2002 and 2003. While an early report by GameSpot in May 2003 described the game as simply \"on hold\", IGN broke the news during their \"Missing in Action\" series of articles that the game had been cancelled. According to IGN's report, the game \"was the first of Eidos' victims to its more stringent quality assurance program.\" Due to the game's delayed progress, it was either given more development time or cancelled. Unfortunately, only the development staff knew of the game's status following this condemnation but according to the fans the content was big and still enough to publish. According to IGN, \"at some point in late 2002 or early 2003, Kronos did indeed shop it to various publishers. Nobody, however, bit.\"\n\nNews of the cancellation did not come to fans until 2004, years after the game's initial announcement and quiet absence. Even Ex Sandy Abe, Ex Chief Operating Officer of Kronos current working for Walt Disney, hinted that Eidos might give the series a second chance under a new developer, such as Crystal Dynamics, but this was only true for the \"Tomb Raider\" franchise. According to an e-mail by Sandy Abe ex Chief Operating Officer of Kronos, \"Unfortunately Fear Effect probably will not get picked up.\"\n\nOn February 17, 2015, Square Enix announced that it will allow developers to create games based on some of their old Eidos IPs via the Square Enix Collective project, including the \"Fear Effect\" IP.\n\nOn April 7, 2016, a new entry in the series titled \"Fear Effect Sedna\" was announced.\n"}

It had its premiere on May 16, 1972, with Phyllis Curtin and the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Willis Page. The production was directed by Frank Corsaro.\n\n\"Flower and Hawk\" is based on the life of Eleanor of Aquitaine, arguably the greatest woman of the Middle Ages. In her long life of eighty-two years she was born the Duchess of Aquitaine and Countess of Poitou, became Queen of France through marriage to Louis VII, and later became Queen of England when she married Henry II. The title is derived from her seal (on view in the Louvre) in which she stands holding a hawk in one hand and a flower in the other, suggesting a dualism in her character that is invoked in this work.\n\nThe monodrama takes place in Salisbury Tower, where Eleanor has been a prisoner for nearly sixteen years: Henry II had her confined there after she and her sons led an unsuccessful rebellion against him in France. Overcome by feelings of despair, abandonment and betrayal, she considers taking her life with poison but instead resolves to distract herself by recalling happier times. As she relives her positive memories of becoming the Queen of France, the memory of her son Richard's death resurfaces. She also recalls the many conflicts she endured with her two husbands, and again finds herself sinking into hopelessness. Time and again her feelings about Richard's death force her into the present until she finally allows herself release from the guilt and self-doubt surrounding this tragic event. Finally, she is able to re-assume her role as Queen when the tolling of the bells announces the death of Henry and her liberation from the Salisbury Tower.\n"}

The company is described by National Geographic as \"wildly inventive\" and is composed by 32 artists from 4 continents (India, Iran, Somalia, Brazil, Cape Verde, France, Sweden, Norway.) The artists from very diverse genres meet each other in the research of gravity and human nature.\n\nWith a background in Norwegian traditional dance choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård founded FRIKAR dance company to give acrobatic dancers living in Norway a creative environment. Together with the dancers he has been developing a new choreographical style for contemporary dance called \"Down2Earth\" including Hallingdans Capoeira and break dance. He works in the formats of aerial dance, site specific ecosophical stage arts, indoor dance and interdiciplinary arts.\n\nHansegård made his international breakthrough with an animation film at the Venice Biennale in 2003 (Tarantrance). In 2005 he won 3rd prize at Superdok. In 2007 he was awarded \"Artist of the Year\" at The Norwegian Folk Music Awards. In 2009 he won the \"Award for best choreography\" at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, among 43 countries in the most seen entertainment TV program in the world.\n\nIn 2010 he premiered \"Jamsiis\" at Bergen International Festival Youtube: Jamsiis. This was a highly personal contribution to the Nordic contemporary dance scene, based on his roots in traditional dances. Jamsiis opened up a public discussion about the boundaries of contemporary dance in Norway. NRK (the Norwegian Broadcasting) writes:\n\nJAMSIIS, Hallgrim Hansegårds new production, is the most exciting I have seen here. It’s very exciting to see traditional dance in dialogue with contemporary dance. Hansegård is branching out and opening up new territory here. He has come down a path that I think is very important to go. That Hansegård is a dancer with strong will to do his own thing and blessedly uninhibited as far as exceeding boundaries is concerned is something the Norwegian dance community should be happy about… At the same time that he approaches contemporary dance, he opens doors. If he succeeds in making contemporary dance accessible to a wider audience than today’s, the genre of contemporary dance should learn to endure a ‘halling-roundkick’ or two.\n\nIn 2009 Hansegård directed TidarÅ, an outdoor full night dance performance under a waterfall with 22 dancers and musicians from FRIKAR dance company. The production collected contemporary and traditional dancers in a research for a unique contemporary dance technique. \"Tidarå\" is part of FRIKARs ecosophical productions. Hansegård directed also Yr in 2009 together with violin virtous Ragnhild Hemsing, premiere at the Bergen International Festival.\n\nIn 2008 FRIKAR was censored by the Roman Catholic Church in Naples for his non conventional interpretation of Peer Gynt, NRK: Bukkerittet. In the years 2005 to 2007 Hansegård directed \"Undergrunnsfargo\", \"Isolations\", \"Laus\", \"Kruk\", \"The snuff grinders\" and \"Bastard\".\n\nHe also participated in \"Dansefeber\", the Norwegian version of \"So You Think You Can Dance\", in 2006. In 2008, his dancing was digitalized for the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) .\n\n- \"AP\" (2010)\n- \"JAMSIIS\" (2010) \n- \"Wall dance\" (2010)\n- \"TidarÅ\" (2009)\n- \"YR\" (2009)\n- \"Fairytale\" (2009)\n- \"Mjølk\" (2009\"\n- \"Bukkerittet\" (2008)\n- \"THE SNUFF GRINDERS\" (2007) \n- \"KRUK!\" (2007)\n- \"Bastard\" (2007) \n- \"LAUS\" (2006)\n\nThe whole company made it to the finals in Norway's Got Talent in 2008. Frikar performed with winner Alexander Rybak at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 (ESC) performing \"Fairytale\". The routine, based on traditional halling and choreographed by Hallgrim Hansegård, was awarded the Best Choreography of Eurovision 2009 by esctoday.com. In 2009 Frikar performed 150 times, including its outdoor big scale production TidarÅ, concerts with the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, the premiere \"YR\" at Bergen International Art Festival. They toured 20 European countries with live performances and TV shows.

{"id": "1519772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1519772", "title": "Geisslerlieder", "text": "Geisslerlieder\n\nIn medieval music, the Geisslerlieder, or Flagellant songs, were the songs of the wandering bands of flagellants, who overspread Europe during two periods of mass hysteria: the first during the middle of the 13th century, and the second during the Black Death in 1349. The music was simple, sung in the vernacular, often call-and-response, and closely related to folk song; indeed some of the flagellant songs survived into the 17th century as folk songs in Catholic parts of central Europe. Musically the \"Geisslerlied\" were related to the \"Laude spirituale\": they were unaccompanied song, with instrumental accompaniment specifically forbidden.\n\nThe first period of \"Geisslerlied\" began in 1258 in response to the breakdown of civil order in northern Italy. Permanent warfare, famine, and an apparent demise of the moral order in contemporary life gave rise to a movement of public flagellation accompanied by singing; the penitents implored the help of God to ameliorate their sufferings, but never formed a specific sect, and neither did they attempt a social revolution. Initially, the flagellents were members of the mercantile and noble classes, but as the movement spread outside of Italy, lower social classes took part.\n\nOf the first period of activity, only a single song has survived, although many of the words they sang have been recorded. Typically the texts were imploring, penitential, and apocalyptic.\n\nThe Black Death was one of the most traumatic events in European history, and the renewed desperation of the people, hopeful for divine intervention to end their sufferings, brought about a return of the flagellants and the \"Geisslerlieder\". Unlike the situation with the first outbreak, much of the music was preserved. A single priest, Hugo Spechtshart of Reutlingen, who happened to be a capable musician, was impressed by the activity he witnessed, and transcribed exactly what he heard of the singing of the flagellants; indeed his work was one of the earliest examples of folk-song collection. He produced a chronicle of what he heard in the \"Chronicon Hugonis sacerdotis de Rutelinga\" (1349), and the content corresponded closely to the description of the lost music from a hundred years before: simple monophonic songs of verse and refrain, with a leader singing the verse and the group of flagellants singing the refrain in unison. Particularly interesting about Hugo's transcriptions was his notation of \"variation\" between successive verses sung by the lead singer, a procedure common in folk song.\n\nThis second outbreak of flagellants, with their incessant and repetitive \"Geisslerlieder\" spread far wider than the first, reaching England, Poland, and Scandinavia, and probably attracted a greater number of participants, although it did not last as long: most of the records of the occurrence are from 1349.\n\nThe \"Geisslerlieder\" were suppressed, eventually, by the Church. Parodies of the movement quickly arose, as well: in Switzerland in 1350 a description survives of a group singing \"Geisslerlieder\" fitted with new words, as a bawdy drinking song; whether the drinkers flogged themselves is not known. A parody of a \"Geisslerlied\" is also found in the 1975 film \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", where a group of monks chants the \"Pie Jesu\" while hitting themselves with boards.\n\n"}

The game was released on Wii, Nintendo DS and Windows and is narrated by Terry Deary, the author of the \"Horrible Histories\" book series. It is named after Deary's 2003 book \"Ruthless Romans\", his second on the topic after 1999's \"Rotten Romans\".\n\nIn 2008, it was announced that newly formed publisher Slitherine Strategies was to publish games based on the Horrible Histories book series for PC, Nintendo DS and Wii, following their previous title \"Commander: Europe at War\". This constituted their first \"Horrible Histories\" release after being successful in securing a video game license from Scholastic. MCVUK noted it was unusual for a publisher to receive a license from a lirtary work, as video game licenses from film or TV were much more common. They contracted Italian company Virtual Identity as the game's developer, their sophomore effort after the Wii game \"Pirate Party: Adventures of the Black Corsair\". At the time Scholastic noted that fans of the \"Horrible Histories\" franchise had been waiting for brand extension into the interactive space, adding that the Slitherine was known for creating historical computer gaming experiences, while expressing a hope that the title would draw gamers to the book series. Meanwhile, Slitherine was excited to enter the video gaming sector with this \"powerful property\", and hoped to create a series of console historical video games based on this license to coincide with the concurrently airing CBBC series \"Horrible Histories.\" Slitherine asked Deary to write for the game, to ensure it has the same style and feel of the books.\n\nThe name of the new game \"Horrible Histories Ruthless Romans\" was announced on March 12, 2009 by Slitherine Strategies and distribution partner Koch Media, along with the fact that the game was being developed by Virtual Identity. NintendoLIfe felt it was a great opportunity as the target age for \"Horrible Histories\" books are generally entering the video gaming market, while the Roman era provided a multitude of possibilities. The game was presented at the Game Based Learning conference that month, at which Deary professed his belief that \"computer games are an ideal opportunity to teach and entertain\". Slitherine expressed that the game, their first project targeted toward a younger demographic was both intriguing and challenging. Three different North American release dates were published by \"GameSpot\": January 26, 2010, April 27, 2010 and June 24, 2010 On November 23, 2009 it was announced that Signature Devices subsidiary Graffiti Entertainment has secured a distribution deal for the game across North America. The game was released in English, Français, Italiano, Deutsch, and Español. The Nintendo DS version was intended to be more single-player oriented, focusing on exploration and story. According to IGN, the Nintendo DS version of the game was cancelled. The product launch involved: \"various media outlets [being] involved in the trade relationships with a goal of supporting the game through advertising online and in-print, and leveraging co-marketing activities with other Horrible Histories licence holders\".\n\nIn the game's \"Story Mode\" the player assumes the role of Rassimus, a young Dacian man that escaped during the peasant riots.\nRassimus was captured by Lucius, leader of the fifth Roman Legion, sent there to suppress the Dacian strike.\nRassimus later becomes under Lucius Gladius' control and begins training at the gladiator school of Rome to become the champion gladiator and acquire his freedom. The portions of the narrative which set up and progress the story are narrated by Deary, with \"accompanying stills presented in comic-book fashion\". The game is built up by 3D polygons \"with flat features and textures in the style of the book illustrations\" by Martin Brown. The game taught players historical information in a \"less academic and more engaging form\".\n\nThe game contains a few different modes, all of which requiring the player to complete the same minigames; however, the Story Mode also has a narrative that threads the minigames together. The game is a piece of edutainment, deliberately designed for the player to learn as they play. Play involves the player completing various minigames and activities. These include: searching through written content, talking to people, and completing quests, all of which provide clues or inventory that helps the player progress. In order to move up a level in difficulty, the player must first complete a quiz about the Romans. As a gladiator, the player must also fight in the Colosseum. In total, the game contains over 30 minigames. CBBC recommended to use a nunchuck when playing the game on a Wii, whereas a D-Pad was used by Nintendo Life's Sean Aaron for directional movement of the playable character. The multiplayer game can be played with up to three people.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews.\n\nCBBC's \"NewsRound\" liked the minigames but disliked the boring quizzes, spartan books, and average graphics; however it added that the game would teach school-age players a lot about the history featured in their curriculum. NewsRound ultimately recommended the game for fans of the Horrible Histories franchise, while writing that for the average gamer it was a \"hit by the skin of its teeth\". \"CinemaBlend\" thought the game synopsis made it sound like a \"bloody good time\", but noted that players should understand it's actually an educational adventure game. \"Games Radar\" reviewer Charlotte Martyn was sad the gladiator-based game forwent remote-waving combat for button pressing and outline tracing mechanics instead. Ben Hurst of \"Birmingham Mail\" thought the game's graphical design fit in well with the rest of the franchise, and thought it was an effective piece of edutainment. Gloria Preston of \"BoomTown\" thought the game dumbed down its content too much, presenting what she described as condescending content that didn't give the young players enough credit.\n\nSean Aaron of \"Nintendo Life\" thought the game, which he described as a \"mini-game compilation\" as disappointing and a waste of the license. However, he praised the \"decent\" Story Mode narrative, Deary's recounting-to-a-child narration, the intriguing and evolving story, and the exploration of Roman culture; ultimately wondering why Virtual Identity didn't decide to create an adventure game or visual novel instead. He felt the locations were \"largely devoid of life\" while describing the characters as \"static...waxwork dummies\", whose repetitive movements minded him of animatronics from Disneyland. \"GamePeople's\" Andy Robertson thought the title balanced education and gaming, and noted the challenges of the book-to-game adaptation in the sense that gruesome aspects of history had to be toned down because having children physical reenact them would have been to close to home. Robertson expressed excitement at the next entry in the series; a sequel that did not eventuate. The game became one of Slitherine's biggest titles. A reviewer from Game Space thought the game could have been helped by greater historical accuracy.\n\n\"Jeux Video\" expressed the problem of whether to review \"Ruthless Romans\"'s effectiveness as a game in its own right or as a source of knowledge; ultimately doing both, the site concluded it was \"a good pedagogical tool but...unfortunately not a good game\". The site thought the game offered a series of \"unattractive mini-games\" and \"crunchy anecdotes\".\n"}

{"id": "303111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303111", "title": "Jamie Madrox", "text": "Jamie Madrox\n\nJames Arthur Madrox, also called the Multiple Man, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writers Chris Claremont and Len Wein and artist John Buscema, he first appeared in \"Giant-Size Fantastic Four\" #4 (February 1975).\n\nA mutant with the ability to create instant duplicates of himself, Madrox was mainly a minor or supporting character until his appearance in the 1987 miniseries \"Fallen Angels\". The character underwent greater development under writer Peter David through his appearance in David's run of the monthly series \"X-Factor\" (vol. 1) in the 1990s, and in David's second and ongoing run of the title (vol. 3) in the 2000s.\n\nThe character has appeared in multiple television, film and video game adaptations, most notably in the 2006 film \"\", in which he was portrayed by Eric Dane. The character will also receive his own solo film as part of the X-Men film series portrayed by James Franco.\n\nJamie Madrox first appeared in \"Giant-Size Fantastic Four\" #4. In the 1990s, he played a major role in the series \"X-Factor\". Writer Peter David later admitted that he was unhappy that he had to use Madrox in \"X-Factor\", and it was only over the course of writing the series that he became one of his favorite characters. A \"MadroX\" miniseries was published in 2004, also written by David. He and the other members of his detective agency later starred in a revamped \"X-Factor\" monthly series that is again written by Peter David.\n\nJamie Madrox is born to a family living near the Los Alamos research facility in New Mexico; the background radiation may have stimulated his mutation. When Jamie is born, the doctor's slap causes him to multiply into two identical babies. Professor Charles Xavier, a friend of the Madrox family, suggests that they move to Kansas to raise the boy in privacy. Dr. Daniel Madrox, Jamie's father, creates a suit for him to wear which is designed to absorb kinetic energy, the source of the duplication.\n\nLater, Damian Tryp of Singularity Investigations makes his own offer to look after Jamie, claiming that Jamie is not just a normal mutant, but actually a \"changeling\", a predecessor to mutants who develops its powers at birth. Jamie's parents refuse to give Jamie to Tryp. When Jamie is fifteen years old, his parents are killed by a tornado alleged to have been caused by Tryp, and Jamie begins to run the farm by himself along with his duplicates, or \"dupes\", until his suit is damaged.\n\nIn his first appearance his date of birth was listed as September 7th, 1953.\n\nJamie Madrox goes to New York City for help where he meets Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four. He contacts Professor Xavier, who sends the youth to Muir Island with Moira McTaggert, to work in her laboratory and help her with research. He later helps Moira and fellow mutants Havok and Polaris in searching for the escaped mutant Proteus. Proteus hijacks one of Madrox's duplicates as his own body, although this does not harm Madrox. Following the X-Men's battle with Proteus on Muir Island, Madrox is invited to join the X-Men, but he declines.\n\nOne of Jamie's renegade duplicates later searches with Siryn for the runaway New Mutants Sunspot and Warlock. They find Siryn and Jamie joins the Fallen Angels.\n\nJamie Madrox is then one of the residents of Muir Island who comes under the mental control of the Shadow King. Following the destruction of Muir Island and the defeat of the Shadow King, he becomes a member of the second incarnation of the X-Factor team, which is assembled by Val Cooper as a U.S. government response team. Here, he develops a reputation as a prankster, forming a friendship with teammate Strong Guy. Also on the team is former New Mutant Wolfsbane who later joins his X-Factor Investigations.\n\nIn the first day of the team, one of his duplicates is shot and killed, and Madrox learns for the first time that he cannot absorb a deceased duplicate. This makes him realize for the first time how independent his duplicates actually are. This becomes clearer to him when a duplicate, working for Mister Sinister, decides that it wants to absorb the original, which it does for a short time, until Jamie's dominant personality breaks free and reabsorbs the wayward dupe.\n\nAfter he is exposed to the Legacy Virus while performing CPR on an infected Genoshan mutate, Jamie is forced to kill the Acolyte Seamus Mellencamp in self-defense by creating a dupe inside the mutant while his hand is in Mellencamp's mouth. The clone later died from the Legacy Virus. Madrox does not often fight in cosmic battles like most of the other X-Men, but he fought doppelgangers during the Infinity War and, being religious, is taken by the cosmic entity Goddess during the Infinity Crusade.\n\nJamie's health continues to deteriorate due to the Legacy Virus. An attempted cure by Haven leaves him dead, until it is revealed that it was a duplicate who had been infected and died; the real Madrox was alive and suffering from amnesia.\n\nJamie is the motivation for the Government-sponsored version of X-Factor to break ties with the government and go underground when the team is tricked into thinking Jamie and his duplicates are actually a squad of super-powered terrorists. Eventually, the team discovers this was a manipulation and the group goes rogue, splitting from the government.\n\nHe seeks out Strong Guy, ill after Jamie's alleged death. Unfortunately, this makes Strong Guy even weaker, but Jamie's mistake is fixed by the genius of new team leader Forge.\n\nHe then serves as majority staff for Banshee's X-Corps. Banshee hires ex-criminals to police other mutants but things get bad when Mystique goes on a murderous rampage and has Mastermind's daughter mind control them. The X-Men manage to defeat the renegade X-Corps members, he transfers to one of Xavier's official \"non X-Men\" mutant teams in Paris's X-Corporation, fighting Weapon XII in the Channel which results in the death of teammate Darkstar.\n\nAfter the fall of the X-Corporation, Jamie Madrox begins working as a private detective in the \"Mutant Town\" area of New York, along with former X-Factor teammates Wolfsbane and Strong Guy. In the passing time, Madrox has been sending out his duplicates to lead lives of their own. Among these dupes are a Shaolin monk and an Olympic Gymnast. By this point, his powers are developed to such an extent that any dupe who gains sufficient skills can pass its knowledge on to Jamie, giving him a wide variety of training instantly.\n\nThe side effect of excessive withdrawal from absorbing the duplicates leads him to gain their new personalities as well, which gives him a form of multiple personality disorder, in which any new dupes may spontaneously generate any individual personality aspect of Jamie Prime, making them unpredicatible, as they more often than not disobey his orders or manifest as personalities that are too volatile or meek.\n\nIt is during this period that he encounters an assassin named Clay who has the same powers as Jamie. Although killed after telling Jamie that the Multiple Man has no idea what he truly is, Clay would come back later.\n\nFollowing the elimination of all but a couple of hundred mutants from the face of the Earth in the \"House of M\" storyline, it is revealed that Jamie Madrox has upgraded his private detective agency to a new building, under the name X-Factor Investigations. He bought the building using money from a \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\"-type show, using a room full of dupes as lifelines.\n\nStill suffering from uncontrollable duplicate personalities, Jamie sends one to talk a de-powered Rictor out of jumping off a building who instead pushes him off. The dupe calls himself \"The X-Factor\" and threatens Madrox that he will come out whenever dupes are made, and Madrox won't be able to tell before being reabsorbed, and Jamie's new team adds Rictor to the group, along with M, and Siryn. Celebrating a victory after discovering he's not a mutant, but a changeling (see opening biography entry), Jamie has sex with Siryn, and an accidentally forgotten duplicate with M. When Jamie discovers and absorbs the duplicate, both females are furious with him.\n\nLater, Layla Miller, without a home after House of M's reality is shattered, reveals to Jamie that one day they will get married, and Wolfsbane will kill them both on their wedding night.\n\nDuring \"Civil War\", a duplicate Jamie had created a few years ago eventually becomes agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.; since he is an enforcer of the Superhuman Registration Act, he registered M and Rictor. However, the true Jamie and X-Factor stand opposed to the legislation, going so far as to make a public statement regarding their position, leading Jamie to go in direct opposition to the neutral stance taken by X-Men leader Cyclops upset at for Jamie withholding the truth about M-Day. Jamie also declares that the empty Mutant Town will be a sanctuary for superheroes being pursued by the government.\n\nAgent Madrox recently met \"his\" end when he was surprised and re-absorbed by the original Madrox during an investigation of a HYDRA cell. Jamie continues the task of hunting down his stray duplicates and reabsorbing them, but he leaves one, John Maddox, who has carved out a life for himself as an Episcopal priest, husband and father, and Jamie decided not to reabsorb him. Siryn also discovers that she is pregnant by Jamie.\n\nDuring the 2007 - 2008 \"\" storyline, Cyclops sends Jamie Madrox and Layla Miller to go see Forge having built a machine that allows to monitor alternate timelines. Madrox sends two dupes to find information on two timelines that showed \"spikes\", after the birth of the Mutant baby, due to two different timelines: one in which the newborn becomes the planet's savior and another where it becomes its dominator. Before anyone can react, Layla jumps into the portal along with one of the dupes, and Madrox collapses into a coma.\n\nLayla and one Madrox duplicate arrive eighty years in the negative future to discover that the mutant race has been severely decimated. Mutants are imprisoned in concentration camps overseen by humans. Layla and the dupe are captured and tattooed with an \"M\" for mutant over their eyes. There, they encounter a youthful Lucas Bishop that would gladly go back in time to kill the mutant baby responsible for the way this timeline has turned out. Layla straps a stolen grenade to the duplicate, killing him and sending his memories of the event back to Jamie so he can tell of Bishop's treachery. When Jamie awakens, he develops an M tattoo because his body takes on scarring from duplicates. Jamie leaves and returns to X-Factor Investigations, disillusioned due to Layla's loss.\n\nThe other duplicate later returns as the character Cortex.\n\nSiryn goes into labor and proposes to Jamie Madrox, who accepts. Siryn gives birth to a boy, named Sean after her own father. Just hours after his birth, however, Sean, much to the horror of Jamie, Theresa and X-Factor, is absorbed into Jamie's body as Jamie holds the boy, completely against Jamie's will. Jamie realizes that the baby must have been fathered by a dupe rather than by him, and that \"the offspring of a dupe isn't really anything more than a dupe\". Siryn, filled with rage toward Jamie, breaks his finger and tells him to leave.\n\nJamie goes to see his preacher dupe John Maddox. Jamie realizes that if the child of a dupe is merely an \"infant dupe\", then John's son should have been absorbed either by John himself, or when Jamie ruffled the boys hair; therefore John's son must not be his. John admits that he already knows his wife had an affair. Jamie reveals that he plans to kill himself over the grief caused by Sean, but is prevented by a holographic projection of an adult Layla Miller who takes him into the future.\n\nJamie Madrox is transported to the future in the midst of the Summers Rebellion, where mutants rise up against Sentinel and human oppressors, which is led by Ruby Summers, the daughter of Cyclops and Emma Frost, with Cyclops's optic blasts and Emma's organic mineral body, Layla Miller, and a cyborg Cyclops whose predicament is Jamie's fault.\n\nAfter kissing Layla (now an adult) out of happiness at seeing her, Cyclops wants Jamie to find out why some mutants are winking out of existence. The group visit an aging senile Doctor Doom who says Layla told him in the past that he'd have to instruct Jamie and her on something in the future, and it is now.\n\nIn the present, a former mutant named Lenore ask assistance to X-Factor, claiming that someone was trying to kill her. She felt she was being followed, but every time she looked, it was a different person doing it. Her best friend Candy, another former mutant, was found dead of a gunshot wound which the police ruled a suicide. Lenore didn't believe it, because Candy had a pathological fear of guns. Before Candy died, she told Lenore that she thought she was being followed. Later, Lenore's mother showed up at Lenore's apartment and attempted to shoot her, but was foiled by Longshot. Escaping, Lenore's mother took Darwin hostage. At the last minute, she turned the gun on herself, but it backfired due to Longshot's luck powers. At the hospital, Monet St. Croix attempted to read Lenore's mother's mind, but was overpowered and collapsed. When she woke up, she grabbed Longshot's throat and said \"Cortex\".\n\nWhile Strong Guy and Rictor were visiting John Maddox in Vermont, Shatterstar busted through the window and tried to stab Rictor, saying only \"Cortex\". Once freed of Cortex' control, Shatterstar and Rictor shared a passionate kiss. When Cortex tried to bring Longshot under his mental and physical control, he noted that Longshot and Shatterstar were in many ways identical.\n\nOnce she calmed down, Monet told the group that her violent outburst was because of psychic feedback that occurred after she had broken through a psychic barrier in Lenore's mother's mind, but that whatever was controlling her had fled. She then manipulated the group into moving Lenore out of her apartment and hiding her in a penthouse suite in an expensive hotel. There she tried to seduce Darwin, but he figured out that she was acting out of character only to try to get Lenore alone, and so resisted. Monet's body turned bright purple and became covered in tint lights and circuitry. She said that she would then have to kill Darwin, even though he wasn't on Cortex's list. This suggests that whatever Monet had become, she was acting somewhat independently of Cortex himself while receiving instructions from him.\n\nWhen Cortex loses control over Monet, he is attacked and his hood falls back revealing that he is a duplicate of Madrox. Having his identity uncovered Cortex reveals himself as the second duplicate sent to one of the two \"remaining\" futures for mutantkind during the \"Messiah Complex\", to search for a cure for the depowering of 98% of the world's mutants following M-Day, then die in some fashion so that his memories would be transferred back to Madrox.\n\nHow this duplicate travelled from the alternative future he was sent to Earth-1191 remains a mystery. The only thing known is that under the direction of Anthony Falcone, who in turn was under the guidance of Damian Tryp from Earth-616, this duplicate was turned into a \"doomlock\", a chronal variance inhibitor which stops the creation of divergent timelines, which required massive cybernetic modification of his body. He was then sent back in time from Earth-1191 to Earth-616 to kill a list of specific individuals, including Multiple Man, for fear how they might affect the future. As Cortex, Madrox's duplicate apparently has the power to mentally control several people at once.\n\nMeanwhile, on Earth-1191, the Multiple Man was tasked by Cyclops with discovering why certain people seemed to be blinking out and then back into existence. Multiple Man theorized that someone might be altering the past to affect the future. Cortex was attempting to kill Lenore to prevent Hecat'e (of the Summers Rebellion) from being born.\n\nDuring the 2010 \"Chaos War\" storyline, Multiple Man is among the heroes that Hercules assembles to help combat the forces of Amatsu-Mikaboshi. Because of what happened in the death realms, the Multiple Man dupes that fell in battle return from the dead alongside the other X-Men that died in battle.\n\nIn the 2012 \"They Keep Killing Madrox\" storyline, Jamie Madrox is fatally impaled by a demon named Bloodbath, and finds himself being repeatedly transported to a series of alternate Earths, including one in which Layla Miller was murdered on the night of her marriage to Madrox by Rahne Sinclair's daughter, another in which Captain America has become Deathlok, and another in which Doctor Strange has been killed by the demonic Dormammu. When Madrox returns to his own Earth, the overjoyed Layla Miller passionately confesses feelings to him. The X-Factor team then discover that Deathlok, Rahne's daughter, and Dormammu have been transported to Madrox's home Earth as well. Madrox and Layla later marry in Las Vegas without incident. After the events of Hell on Earth War, Jamie and Layla retire and decide to live on Madrox's family farm.\n\nDuring the 2016 \"Death of X\" storyline Madrox and his dupes fatally succumb to the Terrigen Mist, alerting the X-Men to the danger of the Mist.\n\nIn the 2018 miniseries \"Multiple Man\", one of Madrox's dupes is found barely alive, and brought to the X-Men. This dupe Jamie reveals that he had operated independently of Jamie Prime long enough that he was not affected by the Terrigen Mist. However, after tests reveal that he was indeed affected by the Mist, and suffers organ failure, he steals a time machine in the hopes of finding a cure for his predicament, resulting in damage to the timeline.\n\nJamie Madrox has the power to create perfect copies of himself, which he calls \"dupes\", and all items on his person (clothing, weaponry, etc.) through impact when he absorbs kinetic energy (although this sometimes has happened at will) through an unknown process. Most of the time, this is caused by him snapping his fingers, stomping his foot, being struck, or collisions. Each of the duplicates has exactly the same power as Jamie himself, and has independent thought, though Madrox \"Prime\" is usually telepathically and empathically linked to the dupes. His powers have, at least once, been shown to affect the actual design of the shirt he was wearing.\n\nJamie \"Prime\" can absorb a dupe back into himself at will, which also makes him absorb the memories, knowledge, and skills of the duplicate. The dupe usually appears right beside the body it \"springs\" from. It has been noted that dupes have trouble creating more dupes themselves if they have not used their powers for a while, while Madrox is able to use his ability whenever he wants without any such issue.\n\nJamie was formerly unable to control the duplication process, wearing a special shock-absorbent synthetic stretch fabric costume that contained mechanisms that absorbed kinetic energy so that an army of Madroxes would not instantly appear every time he was struck. The original suit was designed by his father, Dr. Daniel Madrox, and later modified by Reed Richards. Jamie currently wears a stylized shirt with only six large green shock-absorbent pads on the front of the torso. Whether this indicates a greater degree of control over when his dupes manifest, an advance in technology or if it is simply an ordinary shirt with the same design is unclear.\n\nDuring his time with X-Factor, the maximum number of dupes Madrox could create, including duplicates of the dupes themselves, was approximately 50, but the limit has grown far beyond that, as when Hydra tried to manipulate Jamie into becoming one of them. Their plan backfired because he cannot be mind-controlled, which instead resulted in an immense number of Madroxes that drowned the organization's cohorts. Duplicates have independent minds from the original, but are usually willing to merge back because their memories and knowledge are retained. However, there have been exceptions where duplicates have wished for independence completely, even going so far as to have malicious duplicates intending great harm to the Prime during Peter David's original and modern \"X-Factor\" runs (which featured Madrox's dupes manifesting as aspects of the Prime Madrox's personality rather than straightforward duplicates).\n\nAs a last-ditch effort, Madrox's abilities can be used to deadly effect, which were used in self-defense against Seamus Mellencamp, when Madrox jammed his hand into Mellencamp's mouth and activated his power, creating a duplicate inside Mellencamp and exploding him from the inside out. He has used this method to threaten people before, as well.\n\nMadrox's duplicates can perish without long term physical harm to himself, as demonstrated when the mutant Proteus possessed a duplicate then consumed its life force — leaving only a burnt out husk, as with all victims of Proteus. The possession caused Madrox to collapse in pain, aware of what was happening, but he later recovered. Another Madrox dupe died of the Legacy Virus, but Madrox himself was unaffected, although he would presumably have received the virus if he absorbed the infected dupe.\n\nMadrox also uses merging with his duplicates as a form of healing. Originally, uninjured dupes \"shared\" the damage when they merged. If an injured Madrox or dupe merged with an uninjured version, the \"new\" version had an injury half as severe as the original injury. This method may depend upon the severity of the injury, such as when the M-tattooed dupe sent his scarring to the original.\n\nAs a consequence of splitting into multiple selves, Jamie has accumulated a vast wealth of knowledge and experience, along with some confusion over which Jamie did what. For example, although he says his duplicates have had active sex lives, he is not sure whether he himself ever has, to the point that he was once uncertain whether he or a dupe had conceived his son Sean with Siryn (with the result that his body absorbed his infant son the first time he held the boy, as his body regarded the baby as another dupe rather than an independent entity).\n\nSpecific special skills accumulated through his vast experience include picking locks, some proficiency in Shaolin Kung Fu, handgun training, multiple languages including Russian and Hawaiian, and playing-card throwing. One of his dupes was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, giving him all the prerequisite espionage training. Along the way, he or his duplicates participated in an Olympic gymnastics team and apparently became a licensed attorney.\n\nMadrox has generally been considered a mutant. Unlike most mutants, whose mutant powers emerge during adolescence, Madrox exhibited his gifts from the day he was born. In \"X-Factor,\" Damian Tryp declares Madrox is not a mutant, but a \"killcrop\" like him, so named because they were believed to cause bad harvests in olden times.\n\nIn the 1995–96 \"Age of Apocalypse\" crossover storyline, Jamie Madrox is one of the many mutants captured by Sinister and the Dark Beast for experimentation. His powers are overextended beyond their limits, leaving him nearly mindless, and his duplicates become the Madri — a fanatical cult worshipping Apocalypse and serving as his inquisitors and secret police. The original Madrox is reduced to a diapered, drooling lunatic who plays with children's toys such as rattles and building blocks while being kept in seclusion at the Church of the Madri in Quebec. Eventually, Banshee and Quicksilver attempt a rescue; however, in the end, Madrox shuts down all of his duplicates and dies in the resulting psychic backlash. The destruction of the Madri was one of the major blows to Apocalypse's regime that helped the X-Men overthrow the mutant overlord.\n\nJamie Madrox is referenced in the appendix of issue #6 of the 1997 miniseries \"Earth X\": \"Multiple Man. Jaime Madrox lives in every city of the earth. He's sort of a street informer who peddles himself on his ability to convey anything going on to anyone – should they pay high enough\". Madrox would later appear in the sequel series \"Universe X\" in the \"Beasts\" special, in which Jamie's hunger for meat during a food shortage causes him to eat one of his own duplicates. This action brings the curse of Wendigo upon Jamie. Interacting with his own mutation, the curse created a pack of Wendigo. This pack follows the combined forces of Wakanda and the X-Men to the Savage Land. In a last stand against the Wendigo, the combined forces of Black Panther, the X-Men, the Ani-Men and the Hulk defeat the Wendigo in a circle of fire. Jaime then reverts to normal and confesses his cannibalism before dying. It is not specified if the Jamie in this book is the original Jamie or a duplicate.\n\nThe Multiple Man is one of the zombies that Ashley G. Williams encounters in issue #3 of the 2007 miniseries \"Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness\". Duplicated already, all the copies try to devour Ash who seemingly destroys them all. It is not shown how exactly Jamie Madrox turned into a zombie.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Jamie Madrox is from Madison, Wisconsin., and is a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. He once staged an entire mutant rights protest march. A sample of his stem cells were stolen by the French military to create the Schizoid Man a \"mutate\" (a Marvel term for genetically modified humans as opposed to those who developed mutant powers naturally) with similar powers. Madrox appeared alongside Mastermind, Blob, and Toad when they gate-crashed the Academy of Tomorrow's Homecoming dance, though this was later shown to be an illusion. In the \"Return of The King\" arc, Madrox states that he can only produce approximately 27 or 28 dupes before he gets a bad sense of déjà vu. Madrox has appeared in \"Ultimates\" Vol 3 #2, alongside the Brotherhood.\n\nDuring the \"Ultimatum\" storyline, Multiple Man creates tens of thousands of dupes used as \"soldiers\" in Magneto's plot to destroy the world, succeeding in blowing up Parliament and the Academy of Tomorrow, and killing various characters (including Emma Frost, Sunspot, Cannonball, Polaris, Captain Britain and Hank Pym). Wolverine travels to the Savage Land, discovering that the real Multiple Man is actually a thirteen-year-old boy that had fallen under Lorelei's hypnotic powers. Jamie believes Lorelei to be his mother and that the year he lives in is 1994, and the actions being carried out by his dupes are stories he is drawing. Wolverine tries to call the boy to reason by revealing Lorelei's true intentions, but is later forced to apparently kill him, causing all of the dupes to disappear.\n\nSome time later, Quicksilver starts using Multiple Man's duplicates to produce helmets similar to that of his father.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2782000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2782000", "title": "King Brothers Productions", "text": "King Brothers Productions\n\nKing Brothers Productions was a film production company active from 1941 to the late 1960s. It was founded by the Kozinsky brothers, Frank (1 April 1913 - 12 February 1989), Maurice (Maury) (13 September 1914 - 2 September 1977), and Herman (4 July 1916 - 20 July 1992), who later changed their surname to \"King\". They had notable collaborations with such filmmakers as Philip Yordan and William Castle and are particularly remembered today for employing a number of blacklisted writers during the Red Scare of the late 1940s and 1950s. Some of their films include \"Dillinger\" (1945), \"Suspense\" (1946), \"Gun Crazy\" (1949), \"Carnival Story\" (1954), \"The Brave One\" (1956—which earned writer Dalton Trumbo a Best Screenplay Academy Award), \"Gorgo\" (1961), \"Captain Sindbad\" (1963), and \"Heaven With a Gun\" (1968).\n\nJoseph Kozinsky (d 1950) was a New York fruit merchant who fathered five children, the brothers Frank, Maurice and Herman, and two sisters. The family moved to Los Angeles in the 1920s.\n\nThe brothers did various odd jobs including selling newspapers and shining shoes before getting into slot machines. They borrowed $250 and built an empire up to 19,000 machines. They also branched into race horses.\n\nIn 1940 they, along with their sister Nettie Segal, were charged with tax evasion.\n\nThe same year, Morris Kozinsky looked at getting into slot machine movies. They formed Hollywood Quality Pictures Incorporated to develop slot machine projectors and met with Cecil B. De Mille to source films. Morris later recalled:\n\nDe Mille, he has an inferior complex. It takes two weeks to get into see him. Well, we didn't like that. We're just plain businessmen. We finally told him we had to get some pictures. He said he was going to get Sally Rand to make some. Then he said he had a deal with some trapeze artists. Well, you know yourself, you're out with a gal relaxing in a bar, you don't want to see no bubble dancer or acrobat. You want to hear some good music. You want something with class. You want to see Bing Crosby maybe. That was the trouble. De Mille might make big epics but for us he didn't have no class.\n\nThe Kozinskys decided to abandon slot machine projecting for actual film production. Morris said he told his brother Frank:\n\nWhat is this racket, anyway? If De Mille can do it, why can't we? We're clever guys, we couldn't lose more than ten or twenty thousand dollars. Maybe we should make a movie. Then maybe we can forget how he made us look like mugs.\n\nThe brothers knew Hollywood personalities like Louis B. Mayer and Frank Capra from the racetrack and asked them for advice. \"So we had to go ahead,\" said Morris. \"Or else we would have looked cheap to Mayer and Capra because we'd told them about it.\"\n\nThey formed KB Productions and made the film \"Paper Bullets\", releasing through Producers Releasing Corporation in exchange for $19,500 and 50% of the profits. The movie was shot at Talisman Studios over six days. It was a success and the brothers were launched as film producers.\n\nIn 1942 the Kozinskys changed their name to \"King\".\n\nThey had an enormous success with \"Dillinger\" (1945). Morris told the press at the time:\n\nNobody discovered us - we discovered ourselves. We didn't come in to this business as paupers and we won't go out of it as paupers ... It's like this- we're honest and our door is open to everybody. We've got no overhead - our overhead begins when we start shooting and ends the day we put the film in the can. That's the way we do business and we're not going to stop until we get an Academy Award and land one of our pictures in the Radio City Music Hall.\n\n\"Dillinger\" was written by Philip Yordan, who would work for the brothers on numerous occasions. He later described them:\n\nFrank was like a 300-pound Chinaman. Always a big cigar in his mouth and a drawer full of Hershey bars. Always wondering why he was so fat because, he says, \"I don't eat.\" Maurice had been a prize fighter and would always have black coffee, but he was heavy too. When I first met them ... they weren't gangsters but they had [investments in] slot machines and they were probably running something [illegal] in town. Nobody questioned it. They had a few bucks, not rich, but they had a few bucks ... They were very honest. And they always paid me.\n\nThe Kings had a production assistant, Arthur Gardner, who later recalled \"Frank was the smartest brother and the leader. Maurie watched the money and Hymie just kind of tagged along ... Frank had a good story mind and supervised everything ... I believe Frank King would have succeeded in any business. He was a sharp as a tack.\"\n\nIn 1945 they announced plans to make their most expensive film yet, the musical \"Golden Girl\" starring Belita. Instead they put her in a drama, \"Suspense\".\n\nIn September 1950 the King Brothers changed how they financed their films. They publicly floated their company, getting permission to use a million $1-par shares. They issued $300,000 worth of shares and used it to finance \"Drums in the Deep South\". $300,000 was later raised for \"The Syndicate\". The King Brothers paid $70,000 for 70,000 of their own shares. There were over 700 shareholders and the King Brothers took 50% of the profits.\n\nThe King Brothers later sued RKO for mismanaging the distribution and sale of three of their films, \"The Brave One\", \"Carnival Story\" and \"Drums in the Deep South\", claiming $6,030,000 in damages.\n\n\n\nFrank Kozinsky was portrayed by actor John Goodman and Hymie (Herman) Kozinsky was portrayed by actor Stephen Root in the 2015 film \"Trumbo\".\n"}

Created in 1895 by Charles Fey (1862–1944), a car mechanic from San Francisco, the Liberty Bell's popularity set the standard for the modern slot machine; its three-reel model is still used today despite great advances in slot technology over the past several decades. The original Liberty Bell slot machine is currently on display at the Liberty Belle saloon in Reno, Nevada as a historic artifact.\n\nEach of Liberty Bell's three reels were imprinted with a symbol of a \"diamond, heart, spade, horseshoe, star\" and a cracked \"Liberty Bell\". Once the player deposited a nickel, he could pull the lever on the side of the machine and the reels would begin to spin, stopping on any random combination of symbols. If the same symbol appeared on all three reels a bell would ring and the player would be awarded with coins. Three Liberty Bells offered the largest payout of fifty cents (10 nickels), which was ejected by the machine.\n\nThe payouts for the Liberty Bell were as follows:\n\n\nIn 1907, with the growing popularity and demand for the Liberty Bell, the Mills Novelty Company began manufacturing the \"Mills Liberty Bell\".\n\nIn 1910 the company introduced a slight variation of the Liberty Bell, called the Operator Bell. Changes such as a gooseneck coin acceptor and fruit symbols to replace the traditional images became a standard for slot machines for decades to come, and over 30,000 of these machines were produced. In 1915 the company then began manufacturing a less expensive version of the Operator Bell, replacing the heavy cast iron machines with ones made out of lighter wooden cabinets.\n\nIn the early 1930s the Mills Novelty company made additional changes to their line of slot machines. First, they designed it so that their machines were much more quieter, which eventually gave the machines the name \"silent bells\". Secondly, they created a line of themed wooden cabinets each with its own unique design, the first being Lion Head released in 1931.\n\nIt was this time in the 1930s that slot machines saw a rise of popularity in America. In the late 1940s Bugsy Siegel added slot machines to his Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, initially as a way to entertain the wives and girlfriends of high rollers. Soon the revenue generated from these machines matched those of the table games.\n"}

It is the fourth biggest library in the world. LAC reports to Parliament through Pablo Rodriguez (Canadian Politician), the Minister of Canadian Heritage since August 28, 2018.\n\nThe Dominion Archives was founded in 1872 as a division within the Department of Agriculture and was transformed into the autonomous Public Archives of Canada in 1912 and renamed the National Archives of Canada in 1987. The National Library of Canada was founded in 1953. Freda Farrell Waldon contributed to the writing of the brief which led to the founding of the National Library of Canada. In 2004, Library and Archives Canada (LAC) combined the functions of the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada. It was established by the \"Library and Archives of Canada Act\" (Bill C-8), proclaimed on April 22, 2004. A subsequent Order in Council dated May 21, 2004 united the collections, services and personnel of the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada. Since inception LAC has reported to Parliament through the Minister of Canadian Heritage.\n\nLAC's stated mandate is:\n\nLAC is expected to maintain \"effective recordkeeping practices that ensure transparency and accountability\".\n\nLAC's holdings include the archival records of the Government of Canada, representative private archives, 20 million books acquired largely through legal deposit, 24 million photographs, and more than a petabyte of digital content. Some of this content, primarily the book collection, university theses and census material, is available online. Many items have not been digitized and are only available in physical form. As of May 2013 only about 1% of the collection had been digitized, representing \"about 25 million of the more popular and most fragile items\".\n\nThe collection includes:\n\n\nGenealogists account for 70% of LAC's clients.\n\nThe building at 395 Wellington Street in downtown Ottawa is the main physical location where the public may access the collection in person. The building was officially opened on June 20, 1967. With the de-emphasis on physical visits, in-person services have been curtailed, for example since April 2012 reference services are by appointment only, and the role of this building is decreasing. There are also administrative offices in Gatineau and preservation and storage facilities throughout Canada for federal government records.\n\nThe Preservation Centre in the city centre of Gatineau, about 10 kilometres away from the Ottawa headquarters, was designed to provide a safe environment for the long-term storage and preservation of Canada's valuable collections. It was built at a cost of CDN$107 million, and the official opening took place on June 4, 1997. It is a unique building containing 48 climate-controlled preservation vaults and state-of-the-art preservation laboratories. In 2000, the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada named it one of the top 500 buildings constructed in Canada during the last millennium.\n\nA Nitrate Film Preservation Facility on the Communications Research Centre campus in Shirleys Bay, on the outskirts of Ottawa, houses Canada's cellulose nitrate film collection. The collection contains 5,575 film reels dating back to 1912, including some of the first Canadian motion pictures and photographic negatives. The film material is highly sensitive and requires precise temperatures for its preservation. The state-of-the-art facility, which was officially opened on June 21, 2011, is an eco-designed building featuring an environmentally friendly roof that provides better insulation and minimizes energy expenditures.\n\nA planned key activity for 2013–14 was to rehouse analogue (non-digital) information resources in a new state-of-the-art high-density storage facility in Gatineau, where the national newspaper collection and records of Second World War veterans will be stored. The facility will feature a high bay metal shelving system with a suitable environment to better protect Canada's published heritage. In October 2017, a Request for Qualification was issued to build a new facility next to the existing one in Gatineau to be opened in 2021.\n\nLAC's online collection is accessible via its website and LAC provides ongoing information online via its blog, podcasts, the Twitter and Facebook social networking services, the Flickr image-sharing site, and the YouTube video-sharing site. RSS feeds provide links to new content on the LAC website and news about LAC services and resources. A new modernized website is being developed and is scheduled for completion in 2013, with both new and old websites accessible during the transition period.\n\nIn June 2004 LAC issued a discussion paper \"Creating a New Kind of Knowledge Institution\", and after consultation in June 2006 it issued \"LAC Directions for Change\", a document setting out five key directions to define the new institution:\nLAC's modernization policy provides for transformation from an institution focused on the acquisition and preservation of analogue (non-digital) materials to one that excels in digital access and digital preservation. A Documentary Heritage Management Framework developed in 2009 seeks the right balance between resources dedicated to analogue and digital materials and is based on:\nEight pilot research projects were initiated to validate the framework, including projects on military documentary heritage, aboriginal documentary heritage, and stewardship of newspapers in a digital age. In March 2010 LAC issued its final report on Canadian Digital Information Strategy stakeholder consultations initiated in accordance with its mandate to facilitate co-operation among Canadian knowledge communities. In the same month it issued \"Shaping Our Continuing Memory Collectively: A Representative Documentary Heritage\", a document which outlines how it plans to achieve its modernization objectives.\n\nDespite LAC's stated objectives of continuing to fulfill its mandate by adapting to changes in the information environment and collaboration with others, the actual experience since 2004 has been a reduction in both services and collaboration. Federal funding cuts since 2004 have also impacted on LAC services and acquisitions. A detailed timeline of relevant developments and the decline in LAC services since 2004 has been compiled by the Ex Libris Association.\n\nFollowing the announcement in the 2012 federal budget of a CDN$9.6 million funding cut over the three years commencing in 2012–13, more than 400 LAC employees received notices which indicated their jobs may be affected and the department announced a 20% reduction of its workforce of about 1,100 over the following three years. The \"harsh\" wording of a 23-page code of conduct for employees effective January 2013, which \"spells out values, potential conflicts of interest and expected behaviours\", has been criticized by the Association of Canadian Archivists and the Canadian Association of University Teachers among others. The code describes personal activities including teaching and speaking at or attending conferences as \"high risk\" activities \"with regard to conflict of interest, conflict of duties and duty of loyalty\" and participation in such activities is subject to strict conditions. In a section on duty of loyalty, it also cautions employees about expressing personal opinions in social media forums. Only authorized LAC spokespersons may issue statements or make public comments about LAC’s mandate and activities, which includes controversial changes related to modernization and budget cuts.\n\nChanges introduced under the management of Ian E. Wilson and Daniel J. Caron have been the subject of controversy and public criticism. Caron asserted that radical change is needed to cope with the influx and demand for digital material and they are subject to federal budget constraints.\n\n\nFollowing Caron's resignation in May 2013, a stakeholder coalition issued a joint statement on the qualities of a successful Librarian and Archivist of Canada for official consideration in what they consider a \"matter of great national significance\": \n\nIn June 2013 the Heritage Minister said speeding up the digitization of records will be a priority for the new Librarian and Archivist of Canada. Moore also said he will ask the person appointed to revisit the termination of the National Archival Development Program.\n\nDuring the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, Library and Archives Canada initially failed to produce records requested by the commission in a timely and comprehensive manner and was ordered by an Ontario Superior Court judge to do so. Ultimately, LAC did provide the records, but many were not in digitized and searchable formats as required by the commission.\n\nThe Calls to Action of the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission explicitly referenced Library and Archives Canada as follows:\"69. We call upon Library and Archives Canada to: fully adopt and implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the United Nations Joinet-Orentlicher principles, as related to Aboriginal peoples' inalienable right to know the truth about what happened and why, with regard to human rights violations committed against them in the residential schools; ensure that its record holding related to residential schools are accessible to the public; [and] commit more resources to its public education materials and programming on residential schools.\"Library and Archives Canada has begun to address these concerns by dedicating funding to hire Indigenous archivists, build relationships with Indigenous communities, and support digitization efforts. However, Indigenous-led organizations have drawn attention to the fact that Indigenous communities have been conducting this type of work for decades.\n\nLAC also holds and provides access to archival copies of the websites of organizations related to the TRC, in collaboration with the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, the University of Winnipeg Library, and University of Manitoba Libraries.\n\nThe Librarian and Archivist of Canada is the deputy head of Library and Archives Canada.\n\nOn April 14, 2014 Guy Berthiaume was appointed Librarian and Archivist of Canada by Minister of Canadian Heritage Shelly Glover for a five-year term commencing June 23, 2014.\n\n\n\nThe head of Canada's national archives was known as the Dominion Archivist from 1872 to 1987 and the National Archivist from 1987 to 2004.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36652106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36652106", "title": "Musicology in Cuba", "text": "Musicology in Cuba\n\nThroughout the years, the Cuban nation has developed a wealth of musicological material created by numerous investigators and experts on this subject.\n\nApart from the work of some authors who provided information about the music in Cuba during the 19th century, that was usually included in chronicles covering a more general subject, the first investigations and studies specifically dedicated to the musical art and practice did not appear in Cuba until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nAt that time, musicological research and documentation in Cuba was not undertaken by professionals fully dedicated to that subject, but instead it was conducted by historians, ethnologists or composers such as polymath Fernando Ortiz (b. 1881) or composer Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes (b. 1874). The controversy sustained by these distinguished personalities in reference to the possible African (or indigenous) roots of Cuban music spanned several decades, from the 1930s to the 1950s.\nAnother important personality, María Muñoz (b. 1886), a Galician pianist, professor and choir conductor that graduated at the Madrid Conservatory under the guidance of Manuel de Falla, developed an outstanding musical activity in Cuba. Together with her husband Antonio Quevedo, she co-founded the Society of Contemporary Music in 1929, promoted the cultural journal “Musicalia” and founded the Havana Choral Society. Together with Fernando Ortiz, she gave summer courses on musicology at the Havana University from the 1930s. Those courses nurtured and stimulated the careers of some future outstanding musicologists such as María Teresa Linares Savio (b. 1920).\n\nOne of the earliest contribution to musicological studies in Cuba was provided by Emilio Grenet, brother of the famous Cuban composer Eliseo Grenet.\nEmilio Grenet was born in Havana in 1901 and passed away in the same city, in 1941. He studied Sight-reading and Music theory with professor Armando Laguardia and worked as a pianist in New York City in 1923. After returning to Cuba he traveled to Spain where he met composer Joaquín Turina who introduced him to his professor of Harmony, Conrado del Campo.\n\nGrenet returned again to Cuba where he worked in the Education Ministry Radio Station, started his investigations about the genres of Cuban popular music and travelled to New York City to record with the orchestra of his brother Eliseo Grenet. He taught Musical composition to the renowned Cuban conductor Enrique González Mántici and Harmony to the composer and guitarist Vicente González Rubiera (Guyún).\n\nIn 1939, Grenet published his important work \"Cuban popular music\", which represented a serious study of the Cuban popular music genres, and a thorough insight into the most important aspects of the musical creation in Cuba, from the 19th Century until that time. The book also included 80 scores of representative compositions.\n\nIn 1946, the famous Cuban writer, art critic and musicologist Alejo Carpentier (b. 104) established a benchmark with his work “La música en Cuba” (1946), an attempt to put together a comprehensive history of Cuban music from the 16th century until his time. Although the work presented as facts some controversial historical issues, such as the origins of the well known “Son de la Mateodora” and the “Cuban Contradanza”, this important study (based on extensive investigations conducted by Carpentier) offered a deep insight into Cuban music history never witnessed before.\nCoincidentally, young composers and musicologists such as Argeliers León (b. 1918) and Hilario González (b. 1920) were diligently working along with José Ardévol at “Grupo de Renovación Musical” to improve and renovate the Cuban musical panorama. In 1947, Argeliers León continued offering the musicology summer courses started by María Muñoz and Fernando Ortiz at the Havana University and served as a professor of such prominent students as pianist and professor Ana Margarita Aguilera Ripoll (b. 1903), author of the important compilation of children songs “Cancionero Infantil de Hispanoamérica.” Other contemporary Cuban musicologists were María Antonieta Henriquez, founder of the National Museum of Music, and Lydia Cabrera, an anthropologist renowned for her studies of Afro-Cuban music.\n\nAfter the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Pablo Hernández Balaguer (b. 1928) was teaching musicology at the Oriente University, an educational institution that offered the first Music Degree in the history of Cuba. Balaguer conducted an important study about the work of composer Esteban Salas and published the Music Catalog from the archives of the Santiago de Cuba Cathedral. He was a professor of several distinguished musicologists such as Virtudes Feliú Herrera (b. 1941), who conducted a thorough research into Cuban historical ritual and festive traditions. Her work has been compiled in the “Ethnographic Atlas of Cuba,” which received an award from the Cuban Academy of Science.\nArgeliers León and his wife María Teresa Linares were the leading figures of Cuban musicology during the early decades after the Cuban Revolution (1959). Between 1961 and 1970, León was de director of the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences of Cuba and he also headed the Folklore Department at the National Theater of Cuba, the Music Department of the José Martí National Library and the Music Department at Casa de Las Américas. He served as professor at the Havana Municipal Conservatory, taught African cultures in Cuba at the Havana University and musicology at the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). As a musicologist he published several books which included Del Canto y el Tiempo (1974), where he proposed a subdivision in “generic complexes” to study the musical styles in Cuba.\n\nMaría Teresa Linares conducted extensive investigation on several areas of Cuban music history and published numerous books and articles. She worked as a professor at the Alejandro García Caturla Conservatory, the Havana University and the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences. Until year 2000 she was the director of the Museum of Music, and at a later time she was affiliated to the Fernando Ortiz Foundation.\n\nDuring the first decade of the Cuban Revolution (1960 to 1970) an emerging generation of musicologists started to acquire recognition within the Cuban musical scene. We should mention, in first place, two humble and dedicated investigators that had certain common characteristics. They both had university backgrounds and worked for many years at the José Martí National Library as researchers; also their main subjects of investigation were somewhat related to the musicological work of Alejo Carpentier. Alberto Muguercia (b. 19280), a lawyer from Santiago de Cuba holds the honor of having refuted one of the greatest myths in the history of Cuban music: The “Son de la Ma Teodora” origins. In his famous book “La música en Cuba”, Alejo Carpentier categorically attributed a 16th-century origin to a popular melody called Son de la Ma Teodora without conducting a thorough investigation about the subject, thus establishing an erroneous fact as a popular tradition. In a brilliant article about this subject: “Teodora Ginés: ¿Mito o realidad histórica? Muguercia demonstrated the inaccuracy of this theory.\n\nIn turn, Zolia Lapique (b. 1930), a librarian and historian, refuted a theory formulated by Carpentier in reference to the French-Haitian origin of the “Contradanza Cubana”. She attributed an earlier development and other possible origins (Spanish and English) to this musical style in her outstanding article: “Aportes Franco-Haitianos a la contradanza cubana: mitos y realidades.” Other prominent members of this generation are: Cristóbal Díaz Ayala (b. 1930), author of a complete Cuban music discography, Jorge Ibarra (b. 1931), Leonardo Acosta (b. 1933), Dulcila Cañizares (b. 1936), Raul Martínez Rodríguez (b. 1937), Helio Orovio (b. 1938), Radamés Giro (b. 1940), Danilo Orozco (b. 1944) and Alberto Faya (1944).\n\nThe members of the second generation of Cuban musicologists that appeared during the Cuban Revolution period, graduated in their great majority either from the Havana Municipal Conservatory or the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA), which from 1976 offered the first Musicology Degree in the history of Cuba. Many of them worked at a later time at the newly created Centro para la investigación y desarrollo de la música cubana (CIDMUC), founded in 1978.\nFrom this group we should mention two renowned musicologists that frequently worked in collaboration with each other: Victoria Elí (b. 1945) and Zoila Gómez (b. 1948). We should also mention Tamahra Martín (b. 1945), who dedicated two books to the Cuban choral music: “La música coral en Cuba” (1987) and “Música Coral” (1990).\nTwo other important musicologists from this generation are: Alberto Alén Pérez (b. 1948) and Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández (b. 1947). Alberto Alén applied his extensive knowledge of psychology and statistics to musical form analysis as well as music pedagogy, in publications such as: “La forma de las formas musicales” and “Diagnosticar la musicalidad”. Rolando Pérez developed extensive investigations about Afro-Cuban music and is well known for having documented and analyzed the process of transition from ternary rhythms to binary rhythms of the Cuban and Latin American popular music, during the 18th and 19th centuries, in his book: “Proceso de binarización de los ritmos ternarios africanos en América Latina (1987).”\n\nOlavo Alén (b. 1947) has closely followed the steps of Argeliers León in his studies of Afro-Cuban music and, most importantly, has elaborated and expanded León's theory of “generic complexes”, in works such as: “Géneros de la música cubana” from 1976. \n\nThose theories have been strongly refuted by other musicologists such as Leonardo Acosta, who explains in his article “De los complejos genéricos y otras cuestiones”: \n\nOther members of this Group are renowned musicologists Martha Ezquenazi (1949), Jesús Gómez Cairo (1949) and Dora Ileana Torres (1956).\n\nMusic of Cuba\n"}

It is a stand-alone expansion to the 2004 \"Painkiller\" developed by Homegrown Games, and runs on an updated version of PainEngine. It was released for Microsoft Windows in 2009. An Xbox 360 version was also planned, but was cancelled.\n\n\"Painkiller: Resurrection\" is based on a story game, compared to the other \"Painkiller\" games. The game's basic gameplay is similar to that of the original \"Painkiller\": the player has to face off numerous enemies and defeat them, moving from one location to another. All the weapons, as before, have alternative fire regimes. The slight difference in gameplay is this: the levels are large, with various paths and sections, which require the player to explore the environments between battles. Sometimes, minor objectives are given to player to accomplish. The main gameplay difference from the original game, is that the player most of the time can freely access the whole map, without waiting in one particular closed place, until all of the monsters will spawn; this enables a somewhat freedom of movement feeling and confusion as well, as often it will be unclear where to proceed next. This drastic change of gameplay is a questionable feature, because certain spawn and waypoint related bugs will appear due to that. The majority of enemies and all the original weapons are presented, and there is one new type of monster included. The game features some new additional gameplay elements not seen in original or its other expansions. This includes:\n\nThe story begins outside of the events depicted in other games and stars new protagonist: William \"Bill\" Sherman. Blown to pieces by his own C4 payload, with which he wanted to eliminate a group of mobsters. The fact that he also accidentally blew up a bus full of innocent civilians has given rise to an all new problem - Hell doesn't exactly have any issues with claiming his soul. Now Bill's in purgatory and he's caught the eye of one of the Elyahim, the female spirits who guide the souls of men through purgatory. Guided by the Elyahim's voice, Bill, like Daniel Garner, is sent through this unholy realm to save his soul by destroying evil beings. After he defeats Aamon, a monstrous dog demon, a greater demon appears, revealing himself to be Astaroth, one of the generals of Lucifer. He asks Bill to join him, but Bill rejects. Surprisingly, Astaroth leaves Bill to continue his fight. After defeating a powerful spider-like demon, an angel, Ramiel, appears, asking Bill to continue his fighting and clean the purgatory in exchange for a chance to return to life. Later, after more fighting through demons, Bill is greeted by Elyahim in person. She explains that Ramiel betrayed the Heaven and now he and Astaroth are planning to conquer the purgatory, so it could become their dominion. As Hell and Heaven are weakened, they would be able to claim all the new souls coming to the afterlife and soon become the most prominent force in the world. However, to do so, they needed Bill to eliminate the majority of demons, so none of them would reveal to Hell Astaroth's true motives. Now, Bill has to battle both of them at the same time. He kills Astaroth and wounds Ramiel, who begs him to spare his life. In exchange, Ramiel will return Bill back to Earth. From this points, the three endings are possible.\n\n\nThe game received \"unfavorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n"}
{"id": "158486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158486", "title": "Pelican crossing", "text": "Pelican crossing\n\nA pelican crossing (previously pelicon crossing, which stood for \"pedestrian light controlled crossing\") is a type of pedestrian crossing, which features a pair of poles each with a standard set of traffic lights facing oncoming traffic, a push button and two illuminated, coloured pictograms facing the pedestrian from across the road. These are a red, stationary person to indicate that it is not safe to cross, and a green, walking person to indicate that it is safe to do so. Pelican crossings also provide non-visual indication that it is safe to cross, such as a beep, vibrating button or tactile rotating cone in order to assist visually impaired pedestrians. Usage of pelican crossings is confined mainly to the UK, where they were invented, and in Ireland. A comparable system called the HAWK beacon is used in the United States.\n\nThe name is derived from \"PELICON\", a portmanteau of \"pe\"destrian \"li\"ght \"con\"trolled. The term \"pelican crossing\" originated in the United Kingdom, but similar traffic control devices are in use throughout the world. The term is also used in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe pelican crossing was a relatively minor development of the \"x–way\" crossing. This earlier crossing was largely identical to the pelican crossing, but instead of a green light for motorists, featured a white diagonal cross. The intention of this was to distinguish the crossing lights from any nearby junction (standard) traffic lights). The white cross was widely criticised and users and motoring organisations alike called for the white cross to be replaced by a green light. With some changes to the light timings and road markings, the \"x–way\" crossing became the pelican crossing.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the pelican crossing was the first definitive light-controlled crossing for pedestrians, introduced in 1969. This was after the earlier failed experiment of the panda crossing. Previously only zebra crossings had been used, which have warning signals (Belisha beacons), but no control signals. The pedestrian lights are situated on the far side of the road to the pedestrian. A puffin crossing has the lights on the same side as the pedestrian; a toucan crossing is a crossing for pedestrians and bicycles; a pegasus crossing allows horse riders to cross as well. \n\nAdditionally, a pelican crossing, as distinct from a puffin crossing, has the special feature that while the green person flashes to indicate that pedestrians may continue crossing but may not start to cross, the red light changes to an amber flashing light permitting cars to pass if there are no further pedestrians. This reduces the delay to traffic. \n\nUnder UK law, pelican crossings that go straight across the road are defined as a single crossing, even when there is a central island. Therefore, traffic in both directions must wait until pedestrians have finished crossing and the signal is green or flashing amber. This rule is different from similar standard pedestrian crossings where each portion of the crossing is treated as a separate crossing. However, at installations where the crossings that cross each carriageway are separate crossings, the crossing is staggered.\n\nIn 1974, \"Dad's Army\" performed a public information film to explain the pelican crossing, and how it works. In 1976, Paul Greenwood sung \"The Pelican Crossing Song\", again explaining how a pelican crossing works. In 2000, Shooglenifty incorporated samples of a pelican crossing into their album \"Solar Shears\".\n\nStatutory authority for pelican crossings was removed in the 2016 update of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions. After 22 October 2016, no new pelican crossings can be installed on public highways in the UK, except work in progress where there was a six-month saving. Puffin crossings are to be installed instead. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24314116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24314116", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides", "text": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a 2011 American fantasy swashbuckler film, the fourth installment in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film series and the sequel to \"\" (2007). It is the first film in the series not to be directed by Gore Verbinski, being replaced by Rob Marshall. Jerry Bruckheimer again served as producer. The film is technically a stand-alone sequel to the previous installments. In the film, which draws its plot loosely from the novel \"On Stranger Tides\" by Tim Powers, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is joined by Angelica (Penélope Cruz) in his search for the Fountain of Youth, confronting the infamous pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane). The film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and released in the United States on May 20, 2011. It was the first film in the series to be released in the Disney Digital 3-D and IMAX 3D formats.\n\nWriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio first learned of Powers' novel \"On Stranger Tides\" during the back-to-back production of \"\" (2006) and \"\", and considered it a good starting point for a new film in the series. Pre-production started after the end of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, with Depp collaborating with the writers on the story design. Principal photography lasted for 106 days between June and November 2010, with locations in Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and California. Filming employed 3D cameras similar to those used in the production of the 2009 film \"Avatar\", and ten companies were involved with the film's visual effects. Following inflated production costs which ballooned the net budget to $379 million, the film is currently regarded as the most expensive film ever made.\n\n\"On Stranger Tides\" broke many box office records upon release, was the third highest-grossing film of 2011, and it stands as the 28th-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide when not adjusting for inflation. Critical reviews were mixed, with the film receiving criticism over its writing, directing, excessiveness and lack of originality; positive mentions were given on the acting, action sequences, music, visuals and the running time for being much shorter than the previous two films. A fifth film, titled \"\", was released in 2017.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to rescue his first mate, Joshamee Gibbs, in London, Captain Jack Sparrow is brought before King George II. The king wants Jack to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth before King Ferdinand and the Spanish Navy can locate it. Jack's old nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa, now a privateer in service to the British Navy after losing his leg and ship, the \"Black Pearl\", which he says was sunk, is heading the expedition.\n\nJack refuses the offer and escapes. He meets up with his father, Captain Teague, who warns Jack about the Fountain's rituals. Jack learns someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew to find the Fountain. The impostor is Angelica, Jack's former lover, and the daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard, who practices voodoo magic and wields the mythical \"Sword of Triton\" that controls his ship, the \"Queen Anne's Revenge\". While Jack is shanghaied aboard Blackbeard's ship, Gibbs escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jack's map showing the Fountain's location, forcing Barbossa to take him along.\n\nMeanwhile, after a failed mutiny aboard the \"Queen Anne's Revenge\", Jack is forced to guide the crew to the Fountain. Blackbeard seeks the Fountain's power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with a \"one-legged man\", who happened to be Barbossa. Jack must find two silver chalices aboard Juan Ponce de León's missing flagship, the \"Santiago\". The Fountain's water must simultaneously be drunk by two people from the chalices. Drinking from one chalice containing a mermaid's tear will extend life; the second person dies, their remaining years of life transferred to the other drinker. Jack also discovers that the \"Black Pearl\" was captured and shrunk before being added to Blackbeard's collection of other shrunken ships in bottles.\n\nThe \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" heads for Whitecap Bay to find and harvest mermaid tears. After managing to lure in a mermaid named Tamara, she summons other mermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an explosion that scares them away. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive missionary, falls in love with her. Reaching Ponce de León's ship on an uncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa there. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel.\n\nJack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the chalices. Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the \"Black Pearl\", and his leg being amputated. Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices. Meanwhile, Syrena, reciprocating Philip's love, is tricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die of dehydration while Philip is forced to go with them. Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica's safety, Jack's confiscated magical compass (which they took from him before sending him to get the chalices), and Gibbs' release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set free with the compass.\n\nAt the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew is confronted by Barbossa and his men and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish suddenly arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena goes back to the dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.\n\nWith Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death, Jack retrieves the last remaining drops of water from the destroyed fountain and puts the tear in one of them. Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed, he wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it, asking his daughter to save him. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a mistake about which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body, killing him.\n\nEventually, Jack and Angelica admit their love for each other, yet he distrusts her intentions (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a cay. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the \"Revenge\". He reclaims the shrunken \"Black Pearl\" and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a gunny sack. The two leave, .\n\nIn a post-credits scene, a voodoo doll of Jack crafted by Blackbeard washes ashore and is found by Angelica, who then smiles.\n\nShortly before the premiere of \"\", Jerry Bruckheimer stated it was the end of the trilogy, but the idea of a spin-off was still possible. After the film's successful opening weekend, Dick Cook, then Chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, said he was interested in a fourth installment. \"Los Angeles Times\" also reported that rights to a book were bought. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio had started working on a script in 2007, but they were interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and only resumed in mid-2008.\n\nIn June 2009, Bruckheimer indicated Disney would prefer the fourth installment of \"Pirates \" to be released before \"The Lone Ranger\" film, which he, Johnny Depp, Ted Elliott, and Terry Rossio had been working on for release on May 20, 2011. He hoped Gore Verbinski would return to direct the fourth film, as his \"BioShock\" film adaptation had been put on hold. As Verbinski was unavailable due to his commitment with \"Rango\" the same year, Bruckheimer suggested Rob Marshall, who he considered a \"premiere filmmaker\", stating that \"Every film [Marshall] made I thought was unique and different.\" On July 21, 2009, Marshall accepted the job, because of the \"whole new story line and set of characters. It felt new, and that was important to me.\" Marshall said the film provided him a long-awaited opportunity to work with Depp, and that his directing was helped by his experience as a choreographer—\"the action sequences felt like big production numbers.\" On September 11, 2009, at Disney's D23 convention during a Disney event, Cook and Johnny Depp, in full Captain Jack Sparrow costume, announced that a fourth \"Pirates\" film was in development. The title was announced as \"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\". Marshall visited the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disneyland for inspiration, eventually paying homage with a skeleton holding a magnifying glass in Ponce de León's ship. An appearance of \"Old Bill\", the pirate who tries to share his rum with a cat, was also filmed but cut. Pintel and Ragetti were originally supposed to make an appearance, but director Rob Marshall opted out of the idea as he feared their roles would be cut.\n\nCook resigned in September 2009 after working for Disney for over 38 years. Depp's faith in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\" was somewhat shaken after the resignation, with Depp explaining that \"There's a fissure, a crack in my enthusiasm at the moment. It was all born in that office\". Depp also explained Cook was one of the few who accepted his portrayal of Jack Sparrow: \"When things went a little sideways on the and others at the studio were less than enthusiastic about my interpretation of the character, Dick was there from the first moment. He trusted me\".\n\nDuring production of \"\" and \"At World's End\", writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio discovered Tim Powers' 1987 novel \"On Stranger Tides\", which they considered a good foundation on which to base \"a new chapter\" in the \"Pirates\" series. Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007. Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book, \"but whenever you say those words, Powers' novel comes to mind. There was no way we could work in that field without going into territory Tim had explored.\" However, they denied that it would be a straight version of the novel: \"Blackbeard came from the book, and in the book there is a daughter character, too. But Jack Sparrow is not in the book, nor is Barbossa. So I wouldn't call this an adaptation.\" Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, \"kind of a \"James Bond\" sort of thing\", instead of the \"designed to be a trilogy\" structure of the previous installments. They hoped to \"design a story that would support new characters,\" as characters such as Will Turner would not return. Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to \"streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow\", as the number of characters and subplots in \"At World's End\" caused the film to have an unwieldy length. The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded in the previous episodes: mermaids, which are briefly referenced in the book. The mermaids' role expanded in the script, which included a vast attack sequence.\n\nDepp was deeply involved with the story design, frequently meeting the writers to show what he was interested in doing, and in the words of Rossio, being \"involved in coming up with story lines, connecting characters, creating moments that we would then fashion, shape and then go back.\" Among Depp's suggestions were turning Phillip into a missionary and having a Spanish contingent following the protagonists. Afterwards, Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca met Rossio and Elliot, and did alterations of their own, including building the female lead.\n\nDepp signed on to return as Captain Jack Sparrow in September 2008, saying that he would come back if the script was good. Almost a year later, Disney announced that Depp would be paid $55.5 million for his role, realizing that without him the franchise would be \"dead and buried.\" Geoffrey Rush expressed interest in returning to his role as Barbossa, and Bruckheimer later confirmed his presence. Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg, as he considered the disability made him \"angrier, more forceful and resilient as a character\", and had to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and usage of crutch, particularly during sword fighting scenes. While the production team considered a prop pegleg to be put over Rush's leg, the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally, with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk. Three other actors from the previous films returned, Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Greg Ellis as Lt. Theodore Groves, and Damian O'Hare as Lt. Gilette. Keith Richards also had a cameo, reprising his role as Captain Teague from \"At World's End\"; he and Depp tried to persuade Mick Jagger to audition for the part of a pirate elder. Previous cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley stated that they would not reprise their roles, as they wanted to be involved in different films. They both thought the storyline involving their characters had gone as far as it could. On August 1, 2009, Bill Nighy expressed his desire to return as Davy Jones, who died in the saying the possibility to resurrect the character, but at the end, his inclusion was scrapped. On February 5, 2010, Mackenzie Crook also announced he would not be reprising his role of Ragetti, stating, \"They haven't asked me. But actually I don't mind that at all. I'm a fan of the first one especially and I think the trilogy we've made is great. I'd almost like them to leave it there.\"\n\nNew cast members include Ian McShane, who plays the notorious pirate and primary antagonist of the film, Blackbeard, and Penélope Cruz, who plays Angelica, Jack Sparrow's love interest. According to Marshall, McShane was chosen because \"he can play something evil but there's always humor behind it as well\" and the actor accepted the job due to both the \"very funny and charming\" script and the opportunity to work with Marshall. The beard took one hour and a half to get applied, and McShane likened the character's costume to \"a real biker pirate—it's all black leather.” Marshall said Cruz was the only actress considered for the role, as she fit the description as \"an actress who could not only go toe to toe with Johnny and match him, but also needed to be all the things that Jack Sparrow is in a way. She needed to be funny and clever and smart and crafty and beautiful\", and invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of \"Nine\". The actress spent two months working out and learning fencing for the role. During filming, Cruz discovered she was pregnant, leading the costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic, and the producers to hire her sister Mónica Cruz to double for Penélope in risky scenes. Depp recommended Stephen Graham, who worked with him in \"Public Enemies\", to play Scrum, a Machiavellian pirate and sidekick to Jack Sparrow, and Richard Griffiths for the role of King George II, as Depp was a fan of Griffiths' work on \"Withnail and I\". Sam Claflin, a recent drama school graduate with television experience, was chosen to play the missionary Philip, and British actor Paul Bazely also joined the cast. Spanish news website \"El Pais\" reported that the film had four Spanish actors: Cruz, Bergès-Frisbey, Óscar Jaenada, and Juan Carlos Vellido. Jaenada was picked for both his work in \"The Losers\" and a recommendation by Cruz.\n\nCasting for mermaids required the actresses to have natural breasts—no implants. As Bruckheimer explained to \"EW\", \"I don't think they had breast augmentation in the 1700s, [...] So it's natural for casting people to say, 'We want real people.'\" Marshall invited Spanish-French actress Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey to play Syrena after seeing her in a French magazine article on up-and-coming actresses. Bergès-Frisbey had to take lessons of English, swimming and breath control for the role. The rest of the mermaid portrayers, such as Australian supermodel Gemma Ward, were chosen for having \"exotic sense, an otherworldly sensibility, but also under those layers a deadly quality\", according to Marshall, and had to take swimming lessons to learn movements such as the dolphin and eggbeater kicks.\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 14, 2010, in Hawaii. Filming was moved to California in August 2010, primarily at the Long Beach shore and a recreation of Whitecap Bay done in the Universal Studios backlot, as the original Hawaiian location on Halona Cove was plagued with strong tides. After a brief shoot in Puerto Rico, with locations in both Palomino Island and the Fort of San Cristóbal in San Juan, production moved to the United Kingdom in September, where principal photography wrapped on November 18 after 106 days of shooting. Locations included Hampton Court Palace in London, Knole House in Kent, and Old Royal Naval College at Greenwich. Interiors were shot at London's Pinewood Studios, and a replica of an 18th-century London street was built on the backlot alongside the soundstages. The producers also considered using New Orleans as a location. In October, security was breached at the UK site when a celebrity impersonator gained access to filming at the Old Royal Naval College by dressing up as Captain Jack.\n\nAfter the joint production of \"Dead Man's Chest\" and \"At World's End\" cost over $300 million, Disney decided to give a lower budget to the fourth installment. Many costs had to be cut, including moving primary production to Hawaii and London, where tax credits are more favorable, and having a shorter shooting schedule and fewer scenes featuring special effects compared to \"At World's End\". The tighter schedule—according to Bruckheimer, \"We had a 22-week post, and for a picture like this, with almost 1,200 visual effects shots, it's usually 40 weeks\"—meant that Marshall supervised editing of sequences during filming. The British financial statements of the film revealed total expenditures of £240.7 million ($410.6 million) by 2013, with Disney receiving a rebate of $32.1 million from the British government, making \"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\" the most expensive film ever made to date.\n\nBruckheimer said the decision to film in 3D was made due to its being \"immersive filmmaking; I think it makes you part of the actual filming because you're part of the screen.\" Bruckheimer described it as the first major \"exterior movie\" to be shot in 3D, as \"Avatar\" was mostly done in sound stages. At first Marshall was not much interested in 3D, but the director eventually considered it a film that could benefit from the format. \"You are on an adventure and with the 3D experience you are inside that adventure.\" While the original plan was to add 3D effects during post-production, the decision was made to shoot digitally with 3D cameras. Only one sequence was shot conventionally and needed a 3D conversion. The cameras were improved versions of the ones James Cameron developed for \"Avatar\", which were made more compact for extra mobility. This meant the cameras could be brought into locations such as the Hawaiian jungle.\n\n\"Queen Anne's Revenge\" was built atop \"Sunset\", the same ship used to depict \"Black Pearl\" in previous installments. In February 2010, \"Sunset\" was sailed from Long Beach to a shipyard in Hawaii for the reforms, where a big concern was to make it imposing, with three stories, without sacrificing actual seakeeping. Given Blackbeard was meant to be the meanest pirate to appear in the series, the look for \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" was ominous, with sails dyed blood red, various elements on fire, and a decoration based on skulls and bones (drawing inspiration from the Sedlec Ossuary in Czech Republic). Damage from cannon fire was also added to show that \"not only Blackbeard was a dying man, but his ship is also a dying ship\". The ship's figurehead also drew inspiration from Blackbeard's pirate flag. The replica ship was used for Barbossa's ship, HMS \"Providence\", and all the scenes aboard \"Providence\" were shot on the Long Beach shore as \"Surprise\" could not be sailed to Hawaii. Over 50 designs were considered for the Fountain of Youth, with the final one representing a temple built by an ancient civilization around the Fountain, which itself was located in a round rocky structure to represent \"the circle of life\". The locations leading up to the Fountain were shot in the Hawaiian islands of Kauai and Oahu, but the Fountain itself was built at the 007 Stage on Pinewood.\n\n\"On Stranger Tides\" employed 1,112 shots of computer-generated imagery, which were done by ten visual effects companies. Cinesite visual effects supervisor Simon Stanley-Clamp claimed that the most difficult part was doing the effects in 3D: \"Rotoscoping is tricky. Cleaning up plates is double the work, and tracking has to be spot on.\" The lead companies, with over 300 effects each, were Industrial Light & Magic—responsible for, among others, the mermaids and most water effects—and Moving Picture Company, who created digital ships and environment extensions, such as changing weather and designing cliffs and waterfalls. Filming the mermaids involved eight model-actresses, who portrayed them outside the water, as well as 22 synchronized swimming athletes and a group of stuntwomen, both of whom wore motion capture suits to be later replaced by digital mermaids. Mermaid corpses were depicted by plaster models. The design tried to avoid the traditional representations of mermaids in paintings and literature, instead going for a scaly body with a translucent membrane inspired by both jellyfish and the fabric employed in ballet tutus. To make the mermaids more menacing underwater, the faces of the actresses had some digital touch-ups on the underwater scenes, adding sharper teeth and a shimmery fish scale quality on the skin. ILM also handled Blackbeard's death, where Ian McShane's actual performance was covered by digital doubles which turned him into a \"boiling mass of blood and clothing\", and a hurricane-like formation that represented \"the waters of the Fountain taking his life\". Cinesite handled the recreation of London and Barbossa's peg leg, CIS Hollywood did 3D corrections and minor shots, and Method Studios created matte paintings.\n\nThe film's score was written by Hans Zimmer, who had worked in all of the previous entries in the franchise; being the main composer for the second and third installments. Zimmer said that he tried to incorporate a rock n' roll sound, as he felt \"pirates were the rock 'n' rollers of many, many years ago\", and Spanish elements, which led to a collaboration with Mexican guitarists Rodrigo y Gabriela and a tango song written by Penélope Cruz's brother Eduardo. American composer Eric Whitacre contributed several choir-based cues, as well as regular assistant Geoff Zanelli.\n\nOn January 6, 2010, Disney announced that the film would be released in the United States and Canada on May 20, 2011, following Columbia Pictures' announcement of a delay in the \"Spider-Man\" reboot and Paramount Pictures slating \"Thor\" for May 6, 2011. The film was released in IMAX 3D, as well as traditional 2D and IMAX format, with Dolby 7.1 surround sound. This film was also the first film to be released in the 4DX motion theaters in Mexico and in the Western Hemisphere, featuring strobe lights, tilting seats, blowing wind and fog and odor effects. It is available exclusively at select Cinépolis cinemas.\n\nThe world premiere of \"On Stranger Tides\" was on May 7, 2011, at a premium ticket screening at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, home of the original \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" ride that inspired the film series. Many of the film's stars were in attendance. Two other early screenings followed, one in Moscow on May 11, and another during the Cannes International Film Festival on May 14. The international release dates fell within May 18 and 20, with opening dates in the United Kingdom on May 18, in Australia on May 19, and in North America on May 20. The film was released on a then-record 402 IMAX screens, 257 screens in North America, and 139 in other territories. The total number of theaters was 4,155 in North America and 18,210 worldwide.\n\nDisney's marketing president, MT Carney, said that the film's advertising campaign was intended \"to remind people of why they fell in love with Jack Sparrow in the first place and also introduce new elements in a way that was elegant\". Sony Pictures' former marketing president, Valerie Van Galder, was hired as a consultant. The first footage from the film appeared on \"Entertainment Tonight\" on December 4, 2010. Three trailers were released, one in December, which had a 3D version included with the release of \"\" and broadcast by ESPN 3D; a Super Bowl XLV spot on February 2011, which was later released online in an extended version; and a final trailer in March that focused more on the plot than the previous trailer and commercials.\n\nPromotional tie-ins included \"Lego Pirates of the Caribbean\" toy sets and , a cell phone app by Verizon Wireless, a special edition of Pirate's Booty, lines of nail polish by OPI, clothing from Hot Topic, and jewelry from Swarovski. Goldline International produced replicas of the \"Pieces of Eight\" coins from the movies and gold Mexican Escudo coins, which were given in sweepstakes at the El Capitan Theatre. At Disney California Adventure Park, the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" segment of the \"World of Color\" show was extended to include visual clips and music from \"On Stranger Tides\".\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-Ray on September 12, 2011 in the UK, topping both the Blu-ray and DVD sales charts during its first two weeks. The film had its high-definition home release on October 18, 2011 in the United States and Canada. Three different physical packages were made available: a 2-disc combo pack (Blu-ray and DVD), a 5-disc combo pack (2-disc Blu-ray, 1-disc Blu-ray 3D, 1-disc DVD, and 1-disc Digital Copy), and a 15-disc collection featuring all four \"Pirates\" movies. \"On Stranger Tides\" was also released as a movie download in both high definition and 3D. The regular DVD edition came out on December 6.\n\nIn its first week of release, it sold 1.71 million Blu-ray units and generated $48.50 million, topping the weekly Blu-ray chart. However these results were quite skewed due to the one-month delay of its DVD-only release. It sold 3.20 million Blu-ray units ($83.46 million) after 11 weeks. It has also sold 1.12 million DVD units ($19.32 million). Upon its television premiere on December 29, 2013 in the UK on BBC One, it was watched by a total of 5.4 million viewers, making it the third-most watched program that night, according to overnight figures.\n\n\"On Stranger Tides\" earned $241.1 million in the North America and $804.6 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $1.045 billion. It is the 23rd highest-grossing film worldwide, the third-highest-grossing 2011 film, the second-most successful installment of the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" series, the eleventh-highest-grossing Disney feature and the third highest-grossing fourth film in a franchise (behind \"Jurassic World\" and \"\"). On its worldwide opening weekend, it grossed $350.6 million, surpassing \"At World's End\"s $344 million opening as best in the series and ranking as the seventh-highest worldwide opening. It scored an IMAX worldwide opening-weekend record with $16.7 million (first surpassed by \"\").\n\nIt set records for the least time to reach $500, $600, and $700 million worldwide (in 10, 12 and 16 days, respectively). The first of these records was first surpassed by \"Dark of the Moon\" and the other two by \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\". After 46 days in theaters (July 2, 2011), it became the eighth film in cinema history and the fourth film released by Walt Disney Studios to cross the $1-billion-mark. It set a record for the fastest Disney-distributed film to reach the milestone (first surpassed by \"Marvel's The Avengers\") and it is the fifth-fastest film overall to achieve this.\n\nDuring its Thursday-midnight showings, \"On Stranger Tides\" earned $4.7 million from 2,210 theaters, and $34,860,549 in total on its opening day. It earned $90.2 million on its opening weekend, topping the weekend box office, but earning much less than its two immediate predecessors (\"At World's End\" – $114.7 million and \"Dead Man's Chest\" – $135.6 million) and the directly preceding Johnny Depp spectacle (\"Alice in Wonderland\" – $116.1 million). 3D showings accounted for only 46% of its opening-weekend gross. It closed on September 29, 2011, with a $241.1 million gross, ranking as the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2011 and the least profitable film of the franchise. However, it was the top-grossing movie during May 2011 (with $166.8 million by May 31).\n\nOutside North America, \"On Stranger Tides\" is the sixth-highest-grossing film, the third-highest-grossing Disney film, the second-highest-grossing 2011 film and the highest-grossing film of the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" series. It is the highest-grossing \"Pirates\" film in at least 58 territories.\n\nDuring its opening day (Wednesday, May 18, 2011), \"On Stranger Tides\" made $18.5 million from 10 territories. It added 37 territories and $25.7 million on Thursday, for a two-day total of $44.2 million, and on Friday, it expanded to almost all countries, earning $46.2 million for a three-day total of $92.1 million. On its five-day opening weekend as a whole, it earned a then-record $260.4 million from 18,210 screens in more than 100 territories, in all which it reached first place at the box office. The record debut was surpassed later in the same summer season by \"Deathly Hallows Part 2\". Earnings originating from 3-D showings accounted for 66% of the weekend gross, which was a much greater share than in North America. Its highest-grossing countries during its first weekend were Russia and the CIS ($31.42 million including previews), China ($22.3 million) and Germany ($20.53 million). It dominated for three weekends at the overseas box office despite competition from \"The Hangover Part II\", \"Kung Fu Panda 2\", and \"\". It reached the $300, $400 and $500-million-mark at the box office outside North America in record time (7, 11 and 14 days respectively), records first surpassed by \"Deathly Hallows – Part 2\".\n\n\"On Stranger Tides\" set opening day records in both Russia (including the CIS) and Sweden. Subsequently, it set opening-weekend records in Latin America, the Middle East, Russia, Norway, Ukraine and Turkey, still retaining the record in Russia ($26.8 million) and Ukraine ($2.15 million). Its highest-grossing market after North America is Japan ($108.9 million), followed by China ($71.8 million) and Russia and the CIS ($63.7 million). It is the highest-grossing film of 2011 in Russia and the CIS, Austria, Ukraine, Greece, Portugal and Angola, South Africa, Romania, Bulgaria, Egypt, Estonia, and Latvia.\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 33% based on 259 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"It's shorter and leaner than the previous sequel, but this \"Pirates\" runs aground on a disjointed plot and a non-stop barrage of noisy action sequences.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, gives the film an average score of 45 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert gave \"On Stranger Tides\" two out of four stars, saying that although the removal of Knightley and Bloom as well as the addition of Cruz were positive aspects, the film in general was \"too much of a muchness\" for him. Tom Long of \"The Detroit News\" gave a D+, saying that Jack Sparrow had \"worn out his welcome\". Despite the more linear plot, \"the movie is still ridiculous\". He found \"On Stranger Tides\" to be \"precisely what you'd expect of the fourth installment of a movie based on an amusement park ride: a whole lot of noise, plenty of stunts and complete silliness.\" British film critic Mark Kermode gave the film an overwhelmingly negative review on his \"5 Live\" show, saying \"it's not as staggeringly misjudged as the third part, because it is just nothing, it is just a big empty nothing, whereas part three I think was an active atrocity, it's just nothing at all\".\n\nAs with the previous films, the plot was criticized as incoherent and confusing. \"The Arizona Republic\" critic Bill Goodykoontz rated the film two out of five, stating that \"the movie is a series of distractions tossed together in the hopes that they will come together in a coherent story. That never really happens.\" Online reviewer James Berardinelli considered the script \"little more than a clothesline from which to dangle all of the obligatory set pieces\", and \"USA Today\"s Claudia Puig found \"On Stranger Tides\" \"familiar and predictable...often incoherent and crammed with pointless details.\"\n\nMike Scott from \"The Times-Picayune\" mentions that \"while this latest chapter isn't quite sharp enough to restore the sense of discovery that made that first outing so darn exciting, it's enough to make up for most of the missteps that made the third one so darn arrgh-inducing.\" Writing for \"The A.V. Club\", Tasha Robinson described \"On Stranger Tides\" as \"a smaller film than past installments, by design and necessity\", and felt that \"the series has needed this streamlining\" as the film \"feels lightweight, but that's still better than bloated.\"\n\n\"On Stranger Tides\" also had positive reviews; some critics found the film to be entertaining and well-made. Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, describing it as \"the most fun installment since the first\", calling the story \"pure cartoon, but a lot easier to follow than the other sequels\", and summing as \"the franchise is getting tired, but Penelope energizes it.\" Along the same lines, Ann Hornaday of \"The Washington Post\" gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it \"feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails\". She said that Marshall \"swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism\" and praised Depp, Cruz, and McShane's performances. Ray Bennett from \"The Hollywood Reporter\" considered that Marshall \"shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights, and he handles the 3D well\", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she \"brings her Oscar-winning vivacity\" and had \"lively sexual tension\" with Depp. Writing for \"The Globe and Mail\", Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from \"merely competent to tritely cluttered\", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a \"fresh villain\" whose \"stentorian tones are welcome anywhere\". \"Variety's\" Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. \"It has nary an original idea and still doesn't make much sense, but it's lost all pretensions that it should\". He praised Geoffrey Rush, stating that he \"not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade.\"\n\nThe film was nominated for four Teen Choice Awards: Sci-Fi/Fantasy Movie, Sci-Fi/Fantasy Actor, Sci-Fi/Fantasy Actress, and Villain. Its trailer and TV spot were nominated for Golden Trailer Awards. The film won Best Movie for Mature Audiences Award at the 2012 Movieguide Awards.\n\nOn May 29, 2013, it was announced that \"Kon-Tiki\" directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg would be directing \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\".\n\nWhile earlier reports stated \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\" would be released between 2015 and 2016, Disney announced in 2014 that the film would enter theaters on July 2017. Production began in late February 2015 in Australia.\n\n\n"}

Beginning Tuesday February 17, 2009 The Billy Bush Show! will replace it permanently at an earlier time with an extra hour from 9pm - Midnight, thus shortening the PM DJ shift to 2 hours in order to cut costs, and keeping the over night DJ's shift extended to 6 hours permanently.

It was also released on the Wii, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360 video game consoles, as well as the PC. Unlike these versions which focus on mini-games, the handheld versions are more similar to traditional Rayman platformers.\n\nRayman:\nRayman is the main character in this game and Ubisoft's mascot. He has been captured by the insane bunnies and must take part in all the Rabbids' challenges so they are entertained. Eventually he collects 100 trophies and gets to fight the Rabbids' ultimate commander: the Rabble Droid! Note that in this game, his in-game model is the same one that was used in Rayman 2: The Great Escape/Rayman DS.\n\nRabbids:\nThe Rabbids are the antagonists of the game and have captured Rayman. They have put him in a gladiator-styled arena where he must take part in all their challenges in order to face up to the Rabble Droid. They are completely insane and would do \"literally\" anything to stop Rayman.\n\nRayman Raving Rabbids for the Game Boy Advance is a platforming video game, unlike the console versions which are trial-based. It features characters and elements from previous Rayman games which are not present in the console versions of Raving Rabbids.\n\nThe game begins with Rayman taking a nap, only to be captured by insane bunnies who lock him up in a cell. When Rayman comes to his senses, he notices his hands are missing. With Murfy's help, he retrieves his hands and escapes the prison.\n\nSoon, Rayman's fairy friend Ly appears and tells him about the bunnies. According to her, they used to live happily and acted innocently. Their kind nature led other creatures to make fun of them and always give them a hard time. The bunnies then fled underground, and have only now resurfaced to have their revenge against everyone. Rayman is the world's only hope to stop them.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the original Rayman side-scrolling game, however Rayman loses his 'adventurous' music. The game also uses the concept of the cancelled Rayman 4 prototype. \n\nRayman Raving Rabbids is a platform and party video game for the Nintendo DS. It was released on March 6, 2007. The game is not only a platform like the Game Boy Advance version but also a party game like the console versions.\n\nWhile taking a quiet walk in the forest one day, Rayman is captured by The Rabbids. They have decided to invade our world, and now Rayman is their toy, a prisoner gladiator to entertain them.\n\nRayman's only chance at freedom is to face the Rabbid Droid, but to do that, he must win enough trophies and fight other champions. The version's plot is based on the console versions.\n\nThis game has five worlds: Beach, Forest, Jungle, Factory and Ice. The Beach world is more of a tutorial, and the Ice world only has two levels, each one a boss level. Nearly all the levels are set out like this: Get through the platforming part, beat the minigame and finally the ultimate challenge test. The platforming parts are like most other Rayman games, where you have to follow the path, beating enemies and collecting items.\n\nThe final challenge of each level is usually a game where Rayman is running forward of his own accord. Using your costumes of Earth, Fire, Ice and Wind, you must interact with obstacles to help Rayman get through alive and escape from the bunnies spaceship that is chasing him. On your way, you must collect all the trophies of that level in one go. There are 100 trophies in the entire game.\n\nAlso, there are three Ray Gear challenges in which you must avoid enemies fire and destroy the giant. Fish Creature. These are timed, as if you are on the challenge for too long, a counter will start counting down to how long you have left.\n"}

{"id": "4932951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4932951", "title": "Television in Cuba", "text": "Television in Cuba\n\nTelevision arrived in Cuba on October 25, 1950. In the 1940s, Cuba's two largest radio stations, CMQ and RHC-Cadena Azul, announced they would soon start broadcasting television. Since building TV stations and broadcast networks from scratch was extremely expensive and complex, it took longer than expected.\n\nThey were both beaten to the air by the tiny radio station, Union Radio. Gaspar Pumarejo, owner of Union Radio, built the new station in the Havana home and garage of a family named Mestre. Pumarejo set the inauguration of his TV station for October 24, 1950, which was Journalists Day in Cuba. After honoring the journalist, Cuba's President Carlos Prío Socarrás was shown mugging it up for the camera and playing the role of cameraman. After this event Union Radio's slogan became \"Union Radio, primera en television, primera en popularidad\" (\"Union Radio, first in television, first in popularity\"). Union Radio was quickly followed by CMQ, which began broadcasting December 18, 1950.\n\nOne of the first shows broadcast was coverage of Cuban Winter League baseball games.\n\n\"In late October, the station carried the first of what would be regular Cuban Winter League Baseball Games. A crew drove to the stadium in a remote-control truck. The broadcasts were beamed to the Mestre's house by microwave, where they were rebroadcast. Cameramen were positioned at first base and home plate. The station's third camera remained in the house until newsman Alberto Gandero finished his newscast. After the newscast, the third camera was carried to the stadium by taxi and positioned near third base.\"\n\nSoap operas (\"telenovelas\"), news, cooking shows, and comedy groups were shown. After Union Radio TV went on the air, Cuban demand for television sets soared. Luckily Cuban broadcasting coincided with a glut of sets in the US market. Despite the high cost, ranging $350 for a 16\" set to $2,000 for a 30\" set, the Cuban government's Imports and Exports Analysis Agency estimated that Cubans had imported more than 100,000 television receivers by 1952.\n\nFrom its inception, Cuban television played a huge part in the social and political fiber of Cubans. Extensive discussions about television began to unfold in the radio and entertainment sections of Cuban newspapers and magazines in the year leading up to October 14, 1950, the day Union Radio TV became the first television station to broadcast in Havana. Critics believed that US television set a level of excellence that they wanted to uphold. They believed the medium's primary purpose in Cuba would be to enhance the \"high culture\" education of the Cuban citizen.\n\nOn March 10, 1952 following Fulgencio Batista's successful coup, he sent for representatives of the media and imposed censorship. Though it was supposed to be temporary it wasn't until Journalists' Day, October 24, 1953 that the censorship was supposedly lifted. In truth the censorship became even harsher after Fidel Castro's July 26, 1953 attack on Moncada Barracks. Stations could be fined or shut down for various infractions. On March 14, 1953, CMCH-Radio Cadena Habana permitted a criticism of the coup. The station was immediately occupied by government soldiers.\n\nIn true Cuban fashion the media learned to operate within the parameters of the censorship. In late 1957, Circuito Nacional Cubano, a station purported to be secretly owned by Batista, broadcast a fictional program called \"El Dictador De Valle Azul.\" It starred Rolando Leyva as the rebel leader Taguary, who, with his group of men, roamed the Blue Valley and helped the people fight the valley's evil dictator in each episode. The comparisons with the dictator Batista and the rebel leader Castro were unmistakable. The government's failure to recognize the satire only made it appear inept as well as tyrannical.\n\nMoral censorship also increased under Batista. There was a move towards more family friendly broadcasts and less sexually provocative variety shows. In particular these were the rumba and mambo-inspired dances and more specifically the female dancers.\n\nOn March 19, 1958 - Gaspar Pumarejo once more made history at the inauguration of TELECOLOR S.A., on Channel 12, transmitting up to 16 hours a day of color programming. It was a commercial television station with studios located in the brand new and central Hotel Habana Hilton - now Habana Libre, which used the US NTSC system.\n\nThe following is a list of all television stations in Cuba:\n\n\n\nThe United States Military has a television station to serve the troops at Guantanamo Bay:\n\nDaily listings appear in the newspaper \"Granma\".\n\nWeekly listings appear on the website of \"Juventud Rebelde\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is the sequel to the 1993 game \"The 7th Guest\".\n\nThe story opens 60 years after the events of \"The 7th Guest\". It is now 1995, and the player assumes the role of Carl Denning, an investigative reporter for the television series \"Case Unsolved\". Robin Morales, his producer and lover, mysteriously vanished three weeks prior in Harley-on-the-Hudson, New York. She was investigating a series of grisly murders and disappearances that had plagued the otherwise sleepy upstate town over the last few months. Denning's only solid lead is a portable computer called the GameBook delivered with only a postmark from Harley. When booted, the GameBook displays Robin's plea to help her escape.\n\nThe story then flashes back to the beginning of Robin's investigation. She interviews Eileen Wiley, the only person known to have survived an encounter with Henry Stauf's mansion. Eileen confirms she lost her hand that night, claiming it had been bitten off by a dog, but offers no other meaningful details of the encounter.\n\nSuspicious of Eileen's story, Robin interviews Dr. Thornton, who treated Eileen that night. Though the doctor appears to believe Eileen about the dog, the interview proves fruitful as Dr. Thornton reveals that Eileen was not alone that night; her friend Samantha Ford was with her in the house those 18 years ago. Samantha's family used its considerable influence to keep her involvement out of the papers. He also reveals that Samantha has been paralyzed from the waist down ever since the girls' encounter.\n\nRobin attempts to interview Samantha, but their meeting is adversarial. Samantha's forceful denials convince Robin that the women are not telling the truth about their encounter. Samantha confirms Robin's suspicions later that evening when she visit's Robin's motel room and shares her story. Samantha claims that during their encounter with the house, something supernatural held the girls down and raped them, then let them go. Samantha had an illegal abortion that resulted in her paralysis, but Eileen had a daughter, Marie. Samantha claims there was always something sinister about the child and believes that all hell let loose around Marie's 18th birthday, that Marie is the mansion's offspring, and that Marie is responsible for the murders and disappearances. Robin confronts Eileen with the story, and Eileen denies everything. Eileen then challenges Robin to go to the house herself. After Robin leaves, it's revealed that Marie was listening to the entire conversation.\n\nDesperate to keep her secret from getting out, Marie commands her lover Chuck to murder Robin. He initially resists, worried about the media attention a famous disappearance would bring, and Marie challenges him to say \"no\" to Stauf. He enters Robin's hotel and stabs someone sleeping in bed, but it's revealed that he actually stabbed the police chief who had a budding romance with Robin. Unable to remove the knife, he takes the body to Stauf's mansion, where he is pulled inside and killed for his mistake.\n\nRobin comes to the house soon after and fatefully enters as Samantha watches remotely, somehow having hacked into Stauf's surveillance. As Robin moves through the house, it breaks her by systematically confronting her with uncomfortable truths about her past. He eventually wins her over by enticing her with her own television network.\n\nThe story then picks up with Carl in the mansion. He follows Robin's cries upstairs where he meets Stauf, who is presiding over a game show called \"Let’s Make a Real Deal\" (a parody of Let's Make a Deal). Stauf explains that Carl must choose to open one of the doors, then offers Carl $600. Carl can keep it, or he can pay $200 and reveal what's behind one of the three doors in front of him. He pays to reveal door number two, which turns out to be a large TV. Next, he pays door number one, which is Marie. As Stauf tempts Carl with Marie's sexual prowess, Samantha hacks into the TV, warning him not to give in to temptation as Stauf mocks her paralysis. Finally, Carl pays to reveal door number three, which is Robin. She expresses her love for Carl, pleading with him to choose her. Samantha urges Carl to choose her, revealing that this will end Stauf forever and that choosing either of the others will doom him. The game turns Carl's choice over to the player, which reveals one of three endings:\n\n\nOverall, the gameplay is similar to its predecessor's with the same puzzle-based gameplay structure, but with the additional element of a treasure hunt.\n\nAlthough Trilobyte stated in 1993—even before \"The 7th Guest\"s became available—that it planned to release \"The 11th Hour\" by October of that year, it was very late to market and failed to meet sales expectations upon its release. Early into its development, a port to the 3DO was planned, and a release date of May 1994 was announced, but it was pushed back to March 1995, and ultimately cancelled.\n\nTrilobyte had confirmed that the game would be released on both the iPhone and iPad platforms. The release for iOS was scheduled for Q2/Q3 2011, but in March 2012 Trilobyte postponed the release indefinitely due to \"serious technical challenges\".\n\nIn April 2012, \"The 7th Guest: Book of Secrets\" application for iOS was renamed to just \"Book of Secrets\", and was updated to include a walkthrough and script for \"The 11th Hour\", just as it already had for \"7th Guest\".\n\nIn 2012, \"The 11th Hour\" was re-released for Windows, as a download from DotEmu and GOG.com. On October 18, 2013, it was re-released again on Steam, as part of a collaboration between Trilobyte and Night Dive Studios.\n\nThe makers of the game originally intended for it to contain more adult content in its cut scenes; the script for the game (published as part of a walk-through guide) included several R-rated sex scenes. Rumors immediately surfaced that an \"uncut\" version of \"11th Hour\" existed, leading to the game makers announcing that the R-rated sequences, though planned, were never filmed.\n\nMany of the videos that were filmed for the game used location shooting; the fifth scene utilised a blue screen incorporating a neutral blue drape. Macintosh Premier was used to convert the capture film into digitized images and videos. A program called 'Wavelet' was used to compress the game's videos.\n\nIt was developed by Trilobyte and used a later version of the Groovie graphic engine than that used by \"The 7th Guest\". \"The 11th Hour\" also features the music of George \"The Fat Man\" Sanger and Team Fat.\n\nReviews of the game upon initial release were mixed. After extensively praising the game's graphics, challenging puzzles, storyline, and atmosphere, as well as the lower amount of gratuitous gore when compared to \"The 7th Guest\", a reviewer for \"Maximum\" concluded \"However, the bottom line is that \"11th Hour\" is basically a more advanced version of \"7th Guest\".\" A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" also found the game much too similar to its predecessor, particularly as he considered the entire genre of puzzle adventures to be a waste of time. He also criticized that the game has long load times except when running on high-end computers. Arinn Dembo reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World. In 2010, UGO included the game in the article The 11 Weirdest Game Endings.\n\nBy April 1995, Trilobyte planned to launch \"The 11th Hour\" with a shipment of 250,000 copies. However, by December, retailers in the United States had ordered 500,000 units of the game. According to Geoff Keighley, \"\"The 11th Hour\" had the biggest ship-out of a PC game up until that point - nearly half a million units\".

{"id": "316050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316050", "title": "The Manual", "text": "The Manual\n\nThe Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way) is a 1988 book by \"The Timelords\" (Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty), better known as The KLF. It is a step by step guide to achieving a No.1 single with no money or musical skills, and a case study of the duo's UK novelty pop No. 1 \"Doctorin' the Tardis\".\n\nThe advice dispensed by The Manual includes: \"Firstly, you must be skint and on the dole. Anybody with a proper job or tied up with full time education will not have the time to devote to see it through... Being on the dole gives you a clearer perspective on how much of society is run... having no money sharpens the wits. Forces you never to make the wrong decision. There is no safety net to catch you when you fall.\" and \"If you are already a musician stop playing your instrument. Even better, sell the junk.\" The book also foretells its own imminent irrelevance, The Timelords admitting that they are writing \"a book that will be completely redundant within twelve months. An obsolete artefact. Its only use being a bit of a social history that records the aspirations of a certain strata in British society in the late eighties...\"\n\nThe book is prophetic when it comes to recording technology: \"It's obvious that in a very short space of time the Japanese will have delivered the technology and then brought the price of it down so that you can do the whole thing at home. Then you will be able to sod off all that crap about going into studios.\"\n\nBill Drummond explained his motivations in an interview: \"It was an excuse to say a lot of things I wanted to say about how the industry worked. It was an excuse to go out and say to people all they can say to themselves: If you want to do something, go and do it! Don't wait to be asked, don't wait for a record company to come and want to sign you or a management company. Just go and do it. Also, it was saying: If you wanna have number one...you can have it. It won't make you rich, it won't make you happy, but you can have it.\"\n\nThe English-language version of \"The Manual\" has had at least 3 print runs (see ISBNs below), being reissued in 1989 and—with a new foreword by Drummond—in 1998. The book has also been translated into German, and was released as an audiobook (read by Bela B., drummer of the punk band Die Ärzte) in Germany in 2003, with Drummond voicing the foreword, a motivational piece about reaching out for one's dreams \"today\"—\"tomorrow is always too late\". In 2010, the book was published in Czech.\n\nThe Austrian Eurotrash band Edelweiss took the book as a primary influence: they read the book, borrowed ABBA's \"SOS\", and sold five million copies worldwide with \"Bring Me Edelweiss\". It also proved to be an influence on 2000s British girl group The Pipettes who formed after reading the book in order to explore \"the idea of being a pop machine.\"\n\nIn the liner photographs of the Chumbawamba album \"Readymades\", Boff Whalley is seen to be reading a copy of The Manual. It is a reference to Chumbawamba's earlier success with their hit single, \"Tubthumping\".\n\nJamie Reynolds of Klaxons admitted in an interview to reading \"The Manual\" and stated that he \"took direct instructions from it... Get yourself a studio, get a groove going, sing some absolute nonsense over the top, put a breakbeat behind it, and you're away! That's what I did! That's genuinely it. I read that, I noted down the golden rules of pop, and applied that to what we're doing and made sure that that always applies to everything we do. That way, we always come out with a sort of catchy hit number.\"\n\n\nAn audiobook in German language was released in 2003.\n\n"}

The newest software technologies for mobile devices, which came out as an alternative to subtitling in cinemas, or the possibilities opened up by head-mounted displays, such as subtitle glasses, have made a revision of the technical terminology necessary also in the field of those performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices.\nEven more so, in the live performing arts, the presence of multilingual options on custom individual devices (Santa Fe Opera, 1998) or on mobile consumer devices (Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, 2011) or on hybrid solutions (Royal Opera House Muscat, 2012), makes the spatial connotation of the term \"sur-titles\" inappropriate.\n\nIn both cases (performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices and live performing arts), for a scientific approach the term \"titling\", broader and all-embracing, is preferable to define the work of linguistic mediation, without specifying whether the visualization is to be above (sur-titles) or below (sub-titles).\n\n"}

{"id": "28339106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28339106", "title": "Villa del Cine", "text": "Villa del Cine\n\nVilla del Cine is part of the Ministry of Popular Power for Culture and receives funding through its National Autonomous Center of Film (CNAC). According to the pro-Chávez website Venezuelanalysis.com, Villa del Cine is an incentive to increase film production and to enable filmmakers access to materials, equipment and facilities, not just to provide funding. In 2006, the Venezuelan government set up a sister institution, \"Distribuidora Nacional de Cine Amazonia Films\", (Amazonia Films) as an alternative to commercial networks. Amazonia Films distributes the projects created by Villa del Cine and has since acquired films from South America as well as Europe and Asia for the local market.\n\nAs of 2012, the president of Villa del Cine is filmmaker José Antonio Varela who also directed the organization's film \"La Clase\" The executive director of Villa del Cine is Lubezka Luque.\n\nAs of 2006, Hollywood productions comprised 86% of the Venezuelan film market. President Chávez said the aim of Villa del Cine is to counter the lack of an alternative media and to “stimulate, develop, and consolidate the national cinema industry to encourage the Venezuelan people to draw nearer to their values and idiosyncrasies.” At the inauguration of Villa del Cine, Chávez said, \"They [Hollywood] inoculate us with messages that have nothing to do with our traditions.\" Although he said some Hollywood films are \"enjoyable\", he criticized their portrayal of Native Americans as \"savage.\"\n\nAn adviser to the government said, \"For a country like Venezuela, it's really the only way to build a cinema infrastructure,\" noting that several countries, such as Mexico and Brazil, had taken the same route. The director of CNAC, which funds Villa del Cine's projects, said that the aims of Villa del Cine are to facilitate a variety of productions, ranging from short films targeting the youth audience to large cooperative projects in conjunction with the Mercosur trade bloc in the region.\n\nFrancisco Sesto, a former minister of culture who also made early contributions to the creation of audio-visual cooperatives in Venezuela, said the aim of Villa del Cine is \"the transformation of the state and how people might become participants in the development of film through their own art\".\n\nVilla del Cine employed 130 as of 2007, is spread over , and includes soundproofed studios equipped with lighting, audio and video equipment, casting and wardrobe facilities, and post-production while being stocked with modern digital film equipment. According to the Venezuelan government, as of 2006, Villa del Cine supported high-definition television and surround sound, and could produce \"five films simultaneously\".\n\nThe complex cost more than US$13 million as of 2007, with a further US$11 million set aside in 2008; Venezuelanalysis.com describes it as a US$42 million project as of 2008. \n\nVille del Cine is part of the Venezuelan government's \"Plataforma del Cine y el Audiovisual\" (Film and Audiovisual Platform) of the Minister of Popular Power for Culture. Villa del Cine receives funding for individual projects from the \"Centro Nacional Autónomo de Cinematografía\" (CNAC—National Autonomous Center of Film), also under the Minister of Popular Power for Culture, described by Inter Press Service as an \"independent film institute\". It was founded in 1994 by the \"Ley de la Cinematografía Nacional\" (National Law of Cinematography) to promote, protect and encourage Venezuelan cinema, but is now governed by a new National Cinematography Law enacted in 2005, which requires film distributors in Venezuela to show 20% locally made films and also required distributors, broadcasters, pay-TV stations and retailers to pay a tax into the film fund \"Fonprocine\". The Motion Picture Association of America was critical of some of these moves.\n\nAccording to Villa del Cine's president, in the four years since its founding the organization made 26 documentary and fictional films and supported even more independent films, with 12 productions scheduled for 2011. Villa del Cine has filmed in all 24 Venezuelan states. \n\nNotable projects funded by the new studio are the story of Francisco de Miranda—a revolutionary who played a key part in events leading to the Venezuelan War of Independence from Spain, which was released in 400 movie theatres and beat Superman Returns to the top of the box office in Venezuela; actor and activist Danny Glover's directorial debut about Toussaint Louverture—leader of the Haitian Revolution; and a short film about Simon Bolivar. There has been controversy over the funding Glover has received for his biopic. Opponents say that the funding for the project outweighs the state budget for domestic films from 2003 to 2008 and directors Thaelman Urgelles, and the L.A.-based Jonathan Jakubowicz, said that the quantity allocated to Glover's project was \"excessive\". The Culture Minister, defended the move since the funding did not come from Villa del Cine's standard funds but from what he called an \"additional credit\". He added that the funding will not be leaving the country, but will create jobs and provide valuable experience to the relatively youthful studios.\n\nOne of the most well known projects produced by Villa del Cine is the film \"La Clase\" (The [Social] Class). Directed by José Antonio Varela in 2007, it is a romantic drama which contrasts the way of life between the upper and working classes. Varela became the President of Villa del Cine in March 2010, three years after the release of \"La Clase\".\n\nSeveral politically progressive Hollywood filmmakers and actors have visited Villa del Cine. They include actor and director Tim Robbins and the actors Kevin Spacey, Danny Glover and Sean Penn. Robbins praised Villa del Cine for its support of film directors and is considering a film project in Venezuela.\n\nThe BBC describes Villa del Cine as \"a state-of-the-art production house that is changing the face of Venezuelan cinema.\" Supporters of the project believe that it provides \"many people\" who could not work in film making before with \"an opportunity to work in the industry ...\" However, it has also been criticized as a \"propaganda factory\", according to Nichols and Morse and independent film makers. Chávez said that Villa del Cine would help break the \"dictatorship of Hollywood\". The studios have been controversial with some Venezuelan film makers who fear it may harm independent media. Concern about the \"new\" National Law of Cinematography (2005) governing Villa was also expressed by the Motion Picture Association of America. Studio administrators say they are not politically motivated in which films they produce, with executive director Marco Mondarain saying:\n\"We are looking to make good films, no matter what the script. We really want writers and directors to come to us with their ideas. If they're good, we'll support them.\" \n\nAccording to an article published by Jump Cut:\n\nVilla del Cine offers support to veteran filmmakers like Román Chalbaud and Luis Alberto Lamata while it enables young filmmakers like Efterpi Charalambidis or Hernán Jabes to make their first projects. The sharp increase in the number of features produced by Villa del Cine over the last years is unquestionable proof that this form of Government support has stimulated media production in the country in terms of the number and variety of films, and it has proven a valuable alternative to the Hollywood and neoliberal models of production.\n\nAccording to Luis Girón, CNAC's president as of 2007: \"We don't lay out guidelines for a certain kind of film to be produced, we don't push a specific bias; we just want to be shown as we are.\" Filmmakers unions participated in CNAC's 2007 decision making process. In 2007, Oscar Murat, a project co-ordinator at Villa del Cine stated that politics do not figure in what films are produced. He said that Villa del Cine \"received various proposals and of the ones which won commissions, none was linked with politics\".\n\n"}
