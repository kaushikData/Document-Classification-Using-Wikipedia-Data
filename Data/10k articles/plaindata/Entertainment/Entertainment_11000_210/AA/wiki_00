The Arch Street Theatre opened on 1 October 1828 under the management of William B. Wood. The building's architect was John Haviland.\n\nThe building which housed the Arch Street Theatre was located between 6th and 7th Streets at 819 Arch Street. Famous performers, such as Fanny Davenport, Joseph Jefferson, and Charlotte Cushman, played at what was popularly called \"The Arch\". John Wilkes Booth joined the theatre's stock company in 1857 and played for a full season. He appeared occasionally at the Arch during the 1850s and early 1860s.\n\nIn the 1830s Edwin Forrest played many successful roles at the Arch, and several original plays written at his request debuted there.\n\nIn 1832 the Arch Street Theatre had an entire company of American actors, which was a first for American theater companies. The managers were William Forrest, William Duffy, and William Jones. The company included James E. Murdoch.\n\nIn 1860 the stockholders of the Arch suggested that Louisa Lane Drew should assume the management, and in 1861 the theatre was opened under the name \"Mrs. John Drew's Arch Street Theatre\". Louisa Lane Drew was the grandmother of Lionel, Ethel and John Barrymore.\n\nDuring the third season under Louisa Lane Drew's management, Lester Wallack, E. L. Davenport, and Edwin Booth acted at the Arch.\n\nIn the summer of 1863 the theatre was pulled down and rebuilt (with red plush seats and crystal chandeliers) from the stage to the façade; the seating capacity was one thousand, nine-hundred eleven.\n\nIn 1898 Morris Finkel rented the Arch Street Theatre and presented Yiddish theater for several months, including one week of performances by Keni Liptzin; however Finkel soon abandoned the project and the Arch returned to vaudeville. In 1909 Mike (Mordechai) Thomashefsky took over the Arch and presented both vaudeville and Yiddish theatre until his death in 1932.\n"}

{"id": "781998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=781998", "title": "Biographical film", "text": "Biographical film\n\nA biographical film, or biopic (; abbreviation for \"biographical motion picture\"), is a film that dramatizes the life of a non-fictional or historically-based person or people. Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character's real name is used. They differ from films \"based on a true story\" or \"historical drama films\" in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.\n\nBecause the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses. Ben Kingsley, Johnny Depp, Jim Carrey, and Jamie Foxx all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics: Ben Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi in \"Gandhi\" (1982), Depp as Ed Wood in \"Ed Wood\" (1994), Carrey as Andy Kaufman in \"Man on the Moon\" (1999), and Foxx as Ray Charles in \"Ray\" (2004).\n\nIn rare cases, sometimes called auto biopics, the subject of the film plays himself or herself: Jackie Robinson in \"The Jackie Robinson Story\"; Muhammad Ali in \"The Greatest\"; Audie Murphy in \"To Hell and Back\"; Patty Duke in \"Call Me Anna\"; Bob Mathias in \"The Bob Mathias Story\", Arlo Guthrie in \"Alice's Restaurant\"; Fantasia Barrino in \"\"; and Howard Stern in \"Private Parts\".\n\nBiopic scholars include George F. Custen of the College of Staten Island and Dennis P. Bingham of Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis. Custen, in \"Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History\" (1992), regards the genre as having died with the Hollywood studio era, and in particular, Darryl F. Zanuck. On the other hand, Bingham's 2010 study \"Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre\" shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by Rick Altman in his study, \"Film/Genre\". Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other, the former generally dealing with great accomplishments, the latter generally dealing with female victimization. Ellen Cheshire's \"Bio-Pics: a life in pictures\" (2014) examines UK/US films from the 1990s and 2000s. Each chapter reviews key films linked by profession and concludes with further viewing list. Christopher Robé has also written on the gender norms that underlie the biopic in his article, \"Taking Hollywood Back\" in the 2009 issue of \"Cinema Journal\". \n\nCasting can be controversial for biographical films. Casting is often a balance between similarity in looks and ability to portray the characteristics of the person. Anthony Hopkins felt that he should not have played Richard Nixon in \"Nixon\" because of a lack of resemblance between the two. The casting of John Wayne as Genghis Khan in \"The Conqueror\" was objected to because of the American Wayne being cast as the Mongol warlord. Egyptian critics criticized the casting of Louis Gossett, Jr., an African American actor, as Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in the 1982 TV miniseries \"Sadat\". Also, some objected to the casting of Jennifer Lopez in \"Selena\" because she is a New York City native of Puerto Rican descent while Selena was Mexican-American.\n\n"}
{"id": "723633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=723633", "title": "Bishōjo game", "text": "Bishōjo game\n\nA , or , is \"a type of Japanese video game centered on interactions with attractive girls\". These games are a subgenre of dating sims targeted towards a heterosexual male audience.\n\nBishōjo games are similar to \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books in the way of narrative, in which the game tells a story but the player may make choices to change how the story flows.\n\nBishōjo games are a uniquely Japanese phenomenon. While in the Western industries, those games can be considered visual novels, the Japanese market for bishōjo games have its own growth unrelated to the Western world.\n\nThey form a sizeable fraction of the Japanese market: the most popular have sold over a million copies, and they make up the majority of offline PC games in Japan. Nevertheless, only a few titles of this sort have been translated or commercialized outside of East Asia.\n\nBishōjo games began to appear in Japan in the beginning days of personal computers. The first bishōjo game commercialized in Japan appeared in 1982 as \"Night Life\" by Koei. The first bishōjo games were not too popular, being limited to graphics of 16 colors or less. At the beginning of the genre almost all the games were pornographic.\n\nA notable landmark was Jast's \"Tenshitachi no gogo\" (1985), a precursor to the modern dating simulation. Among early bishōjo adventure games it had a degree of polish that previous games lacked. It was also the first to have recognizably modern anime-style artwork: its characters had very large eyes and a tiny nose and mouth but were otherwise basically normally proportioned, characteristics which today are found in virtually all bishōjo games. Prior to 1985, girls were generally drawn either as normally proportioned adults or super deformed children.\n\nSome games involved elements of force and brutality. These came to national attention in Japan in 1986 with the release by dB-soft of \"177\", a game where the player takes the role of a rapist. (The game's title originates from the number of the Japanese law criminalizing rape.) \"177\" was not actually the first game designed around this premise, but it was unusually explicit. The game caused debate in the Japanese parliament and was eventually recalled and re-released with the most controversial scenes removed.\n\nThe industry gradually moved away from proprietary Japanese hardware to the burgeoning DOS platform, and then later in the decade to Windows. Throughout the nineties, bishōjo games underwent an evolution from being one of the most technologically demanding types of games (because their detailed 2D graphics required a large amount of storage space by the standards of early computers) to one of the least (they rarely use 3D graphics). Thus, more than regular games, the main employees required by bishōjo game companies today are not programmers but artists and writers.\n\nIn the early nineties the atmosphere in Japan became more and more hostile towards bishōjo games. In 1989 serial killer Tsutomu Miyazaki was arrested and was revealed to be a consumer of lolicon manga, causing widespread opposition to pornographic manga, otaku and anything similar. In November 1991 there was an incident where a middle-schooler shoplifted an adult bishōjo game \"\", resulting in increased police scrutiny for makers and retailers. Several prefectures began classifying games as obscene and pulling them off the shelves.\n\nFaced with the threat of being forcibly censored out of existence by the government, in 1992 the bishōjo game industry formed the \"Computer Software Rinri Kikō\" (meaning \"Ethics Organization for Computer Software\", and often abbreviated \"EOCS\" or \"Sofu-rin\"), setting industry guidelines for acceptable content and packaging. This organization tamed down the most objectionable content in the \"wild west\" of the 1980s. Thus free from controversy and fueled by continuing improvement in technology, in the 1990s the bishōjo game industry underwent a decade-long boom.\n\nThe first major title of the 1990s was \"Tokimeki Memorial\". Released in 1994 by Konami who was on the verge of bankruptcy, the platonic dating sim becoming the first major Bishojo game since Koei's release of \"Night Life\". In 1999, \"Kanon\" was released by Visual Arts/Key. While the title was another eroge title targeted at males for its sexual content, the players began to identify with the protagonist and the idea overcoming \"the emotional trials and tribulations of pure love.\" A late PlayStation 2 port removed the sexual content and sold better than the original leading eventually to two anime adaptations.\n\nA turning point was ELF's \"Dōkyūsei\" (1992). \"Dōkyūsei\", whose gameplay focused on meeting girls and seducing them, established the standard conventions of the dating simulation genre. \"Tokimeki Memorial\", the first dating sim, featured good graphics, full voice acting, and a role-playing game-like gameplay system. To be accessible to a more mainstream audience, it contained no erotic elements, seeking instead to create a \"romantic\" atmosphere. Sega's popular bishōjo game series \"Sakura Wars\" also first saw publication in 1996 for the Sega Saturn; like \"Tokimeki Memorial\", it contained no erotic elements. However, it was unique in that it contained not only adventure-game elements but also a combat system borrowed from tactical combat games such as \"Tactics Ogre\".\n\nSince the late nineties, there has been a trend towards better storytelling in mainstream bishōjo games. Particularly notable in this respect are Leaf's \"To Heart\" (1997), and Key's \"Kanon\" (1999). Even though their gameplay involved little more than scrolling through text, they became hits largely due to the quality of their writing and characterization. Both were first released on the PC with erotic scenes, which were subsequently removed in their console ports.\n\nThe bishojo gaming industry has resisted the transition into 3D graphics because of the blocky and distorted nature when viewed zoomed up close. In 2001 \"Tokimeki Memorial 3\" became the first bishojo game to break this trend. However, low sales make it likely that other companies will stick with the traditional 2D graphics.\n\nToday the industry has grown, with most publishers making releases for Windows, including download only files. Some of the least pornographic and most successful also branching off into the console market. The main consoles used for bishōjo games in the nineties were the Sega Saturn and Dreamcast. More recently the PlayStation 2 has been the console of choice with a growing number of games for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS handhelds. Games ported to consoles usually have adult content removed.\n\nThe industry of bishōjo games is closely related to the industry of anime and Japanese manga. While many of the games are pornographic, the majority feature romantic situations with suggestive material.\n\nSome dōjinshi groups produce bishōjo games, many with the objective to later form a real company or to be contracted by one of the great companies in the industry. Due to the short programming time and relatively small amount of content required in a bishōjo game, barriers to enter this industry is somewhat low, and is the reason why every year dozens of new companies emerge. \nA substantial part of the revenue of the industry comes from merchandising. Fans are often dedicated to particular characters within their favorite games, and are willing to pay premium prices for goods like posters, figurines and accessories representing them. Several conventions also exist where articles oriented to bishōjo fans are sold, like the popular dōjinshi market Comiket in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nDue to the representation of female characters in the majority of bishōjo games, a great majority of the market is males. Nevertheless, from the year 2000 some developers began to expand their market creating games directed to girls and presented attractive young men in their cast (bishōnen). The most well-known and commercial of these titles is Konami's experiment \"Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side\" (2002). There have even appeared a small amount of erotic games that present man-man homosexual relations (yaoi games), which take their bases from the parallel subculture of yaoi anime and manga. Games targeted specifically at female players are not referred to as bishōjo games, but categorized under the broader genre of adventure or simulation by publishers, and commonly referred to as otome games or Boys' Love games by fans and reviewers.\n\nBishōjo game elements can be present in practically any type of video game, and gameplay in bishōjo games varies within the genre. There are still some basic formula that defines the genre. The basic characteristics of bishojo games resemble those of Choose Your Own Adventure books. The basic appearance of bishojo games in the West, , consisted of an image in the upper portion, a text box in the lower portion and a static background that occasionally changes extending to the edge behind both of the other two areas. The background images are often reused for various scenes and text descriptors are used to help distinguish differences in the surrounding. In most of the games the player does not see their avatar and instead see the game from a first person perspective. In addition, some games use various techniques, such as the screen shaking, flashing or going black, to give further immersion by demonstrating various conditions. The games' range of sound effects are also used to represent the avatar's eardrums. The characters of these games are less realistic and often limited to only several static facial expression, gestures and occasional eye blinks of which the former two coincide with the text displayed at the bottom of the scene and are constantly reused.\nThe basic storylines for these games center around a male protagonist whom the player controls who interacts with various characters, notably females. Interaction occurs at several points where choices—seemingly trivial—are given to the player while life-altering choices are generally not. These choices eventually lead to various good or bad endings with (or without for some bad endings) one or more female characters.\n\nBeating these games does not mean just getting various good endings, but also in some cases bad endings as the goal is to unlock all of the bonus content. This makes the way to lose such games by getting the same ending twice and not unlocking any new content. For example, \"Gals Panic\" is a variant of the classic game \"Qix\" where the objective is to uncover 75% or more of a picture of a girl. \"Money Idol Exchanger\" is a puzzle game comparable to the \"Magical Drop\" series (which is also categorized as a bishōjo game). In some cases, images of girls are used as prizes for skilled play, as is the case in strip Mahjong. In other games, the bishōjo aspect can be integrated more tightly into the game: in most dating sims, the objective is to select the correct conversation lines while speaking with a female character to increase their \"love meter\". This type of game resembles role-playing or adventure games. Many are very linear and are essentially interactive romance novels for men (sometimes called \"visual novels\").\n\nMost bishōjo games remain 2D. The main reason is that bishōjo games are centered mainly on characters instead of landscapes, and for this intention, 2D bitmaps continue to look better than 3D models (which tend to be blocky when seen up close). The main advantage of 3D models in this context is smoother and more realistic animation, although this is usually discarded by the unpolished look of the 3D characters, in addition to the additional cost of production for this type of work. \"\" (2001) was the first bishōjo game to have all its characters modeled in 3D, although the sales were smaller than hoped, perhaps discouraging other developers from the possibility of changing bishōjo games from 2D to 3D. Many bishōjo games nowadays are essentially a slideshow of 2D pictures plus voice and text.\n\nWhile there are a number of bishōjo games entirely focused on hardcore pornography, many of the most popular titles, including all those available for home video consoles, do not contain pornographic material, and many others only contain a small amount in relation to the story as a whole. For example, the 18+ version of the popular game \"Kanon\" contains a total of 5 sex scenes and two other images of nudity within a branched story the size of a long novel.\n\nThe pornographic content of bishōjo games is regulated by the Ethics Organization of Computer Software (EOCS), the organization in charge of classifying the content of video games in the Japanese industry. Pornography is prohibited in all console titles, and computer games are assigned a special classification alerting the public of its content. Also, as in all legal Japanese pornography, the explicit images are normally censored, showing mosaics or bars on the genital areas in order to satisfy Japanese decency laws.\n\nPornographic bishōjo games are often catalogued as \"hentai games\" in the West. In Japan, they are usually called ero-games, or frequently eroge.\n\nThe representation of girl in bishōjo games varies, but two generalizations can be made. First, most of the girls are portrayed as bishōjo, meaning beautiful, attractive or cute.\n\nTwo particularly common settings exist: Japanese secondary schools and medieval-atmosphered, pseudo-European fantasy lands. In secondary education settings, characters wear idealized Japanese school uniforms; whereas fantasy setting outfits range from witch robes to princess dresses, and Fantastic creatures like fairies and catgirls may be found as well. When the game takes place in some other setting, it tends to explore other fashion possibilities, for example, the game \"Pia Carrot\" is located in a restaurant, in which the girls wear elaborate waitress uniforms.\n\nThe female characters frequently act in an endearingly childlike fashion, which is described by the Japanese slang term \"moe\" (萌え), a characteristic that is often looked-for in bishōjo characters. The reasons for this characteristic are not always merely sexual: sometimes it is used to present a pretty and affectionate character who is beloved and supported by the player. In fact, \"little sisters\" are a recurring fixture of bishōjo games. A very popular game that emphasizes the characteristic of \"moe\" is \"Sister Princess\", based on the premise of the player acquiring no fewer than 12 little sisters.\n\nThe majority of bishōjo games involve anime girls and not pictures of real-life girls. Since characters in bishōjo games are minors, the use of anime allows the studios of bishōjo games with adult content to avoid the penalty of Japanese child pornography laws, which prohibit the simulated representation of characters under 20 years of age. Even so, it is common to find the packages of these games stating that, the characters do not exceed 19 years old.\n\nThe main male character in bishōjo games is often rendered as someone the player can identify with, thus experiencing the story as he would live an episode of his own life. Often the game is viewed in a first person view of the main character.\nSince bishōjo games focus on female characters and the player's interaction with them, male characters often receive less time on-screen and the character that represents the player rarely appears; when this happens, his face is usually hidden outside the screen or otherwise, and he might not even be voiced. Sometimes the only male appearance in sex scenes is reduced to a penis entering from the side of the screen, with no other visible parts.\n\nThe genre is extremely popular in Japan. It was estimated as late as 2005 that bishōjo game sales totaled a quarter of all software produced in Japan. It is estimated that an average 50 new titles are released each month or about 500 annually.\n\nBishōjo games for personal computers are usually sold in special stores or sections reserved for clients more than 18 years old. Nevertheless, console bishōjo games, which are generally less explicit, are sold next to other video games. At the present time, dozens of bishōjo games are released every month, and practically all the video game stores in Japan maintain a sizable stock of these. The games are initially relatively expensive compared to the Western market of videogames, fluctuating between 8000 and 10000 yen (approximately $75–$95) each, although soon they can be bought more cheaply second-hand.\n\nWhile bishojo games are produced in Japan for console market, that is largely not the case in the West where enthusiasm for the subgenre is lukewarm. What success these games have had has historically been dependent on the related industries of anime and manga. The common visual novel format that make up the majority of translations has been criticized as boring and not actually games.\n\nIn addition the genre has been associated exclusively with poorly written eroge. The popular discussion of bishōjo games is widely plagued by disagreement and disapproval of pornography. The debate tends to be remarkably divided: on one hand, critics condemn the genre as totally pornographic, while on the other hand, enthusiasts deny this generalization. This question does not cause as much controversy in Japan.\n\nThe attempts to massively trade bishōjo games in the West have caused a certain degree of public controversy. An example of this is the attempt to release the PC game \"Princess Maker 2\" in the United States. Though it was never officially released, a few newspapers critically accused the game of sexism. Adding to the uproar was a pre-release screen-capture containing nudity. However, the game is not pornographic; there was some nudity which was already censored by American localizer SoftEgg, and the only way to see any real nudity is through an Easter egg cheat code. \"Princess Maker\" attracted negative attention due to the fact it was widely promoted as a mainstream video game, unlike other translated games which had been kept in adult-only channels as pornography.\n\nThe dōjinshi webcomic \"Megatokyo\", popular among Western followers of anime, especially in the United States, was inspired in a large extent by dating sims. \"Megatokyo\" idealizes bishōjo games while simultaneously expresses another criticism commonly used in the West against them: that players resort to them as a form of escapism because they are socially inept (This type of criticism is also found in Japan, though in a quite different form: see otaku).\n\nWhile translations of bishōjo games in English remain a relatively niche market confined mostly to the adult genre, elements of the gameplay do exist in a lot of games. \"Story of Seasons\", \"Persona 3\", the \"Rune Factory\" series, and other games like them focus on the social interaction and the romancing of attractive anime girls. However, such games also offer much more social ties, even if the gameplay may favor social interaction with females.\n\nWestern players can use bishōjo games to help orient themselves to the Japanese culture through aspects of telepresence. However, because bishōjo games rely heavily on iconic nature, their level of perceptual immersion is diminished in comparison to mediums like virtual reality. Instead, they rely on psychological immersion. These games are constructed around popular culture and other social phenomena of Japan which then combined with immersion and telepresence allows a Western player get better idea of what it is like living in Japan. According to Mathew T. Jones of Temple University, Peter Payne, founder of Jast USA, says, \" You’re reaching out and touching a little piece of Japan in the game – you really feel like you're experiencing love and life vicariously through the game characters\". By using a first person avatar with Japanese identity, bishojo games offer an unprecedented means of cultural immersion that, according to Jones, travel and live interpersonal communication cannot. This is done by taking on the Japanese identity that allows for an intimate perspective of the Japanese culture while maintaining the ability to make choices throughout the game. In addition, some English translations offer liner notes or in-game text to explain certain Japanese idiosyncrasies.\n\nThe knowledge can be broken into five main categories: language; cultural events; stories; media; and sexual culture. In the former, language, common Japanese words become a part of the player's vocabulary. In addition, games with Japanese voicing adds an additional level of understanding to the player about the language's structure. In addition, major culture events, such as Japanese holidays, are portrayed. The player also comes to understand what stories and legends are known in Japan, both traditional ones and Western ones and how the latter are seen from a Japanese perspective. Manga titles popular in Japan are frequently referenced in these games and those likely playing the games read many of those manga referenced. Finally, Japanese sexual culture is referenced through the usage of various institutes like love hotels, lingerie pubs and erotic public baths.\n\nThere are a number of terms roughly equivalent to \"bishōjo game\" in use, both in Japanese and English, and there is considerable disagreement and confusion about their proper use. There is no clear consensus on the precise meaning of many of the terms below. The naming difficulties reflect the fluid boundaries of the genre, as well as embarrassment caused by the pornographic nature of some of these games.\n\nIn general, \"anime game\" can be considered the most general term, and other names designate subgenres. Here are the most common terms currently in use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, note that many Japanese games which are not strictly bishōjo games contain elements of the genre. Many mainstream Japanese role-playing or fighting games feature attractive anime girls (such as \"Final Fantasy VII\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Tifa Lockhart or many of the girls in the \"Dead or Alive\" video game series), but they are usually not considered bishōjo games unless this is a central aspect of the game.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the last chapter in his Eugene trilogy, following \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" and \"Biloxi Blues\".\n\nThe play is about Eugene and his older brother, Stanley, dealing with their parents' relationship falling apart as the brothers work together toward being comedy writers for the radio, and, eventually, television. They discover that their father, Jack, has been cheating on their mother, Kate. It is obvious to the family before Jack even admits it, and they try to find ways for Kate to cope with the loss when Jack may eventually leave. Jack reveals that the woman he has been seeing is dying. \n\nWhen Eugene and Stanley find a job where they can write short comedic skits for the radio, they obscurely make fun of their own family. Jack can hear the similarities between the fictional family in the broadcast and their own family, and becomes outraged. He gets into a major argument with Stanley, which turns into an argument about Jack's affair. Later, Kate holds a nostalgic conversation with Eugene, revealing how she had tried to win his father's heart when she was younger. \n\nEventually, Jack leaves. Stanley and Eugene move out when they get the great offers for which they'd hoped. Kate remains in the house with her father, Ben (an elderly Jewish man with socialist leanings who provides the play with most of its warmth and humor), until Ben goes to follow his wife to Miami.\n\nThe play premiered at Duke University's Reynolds Theater on October 6, 1986. Simon has indicated that the smaller premiere venue took pressure off trying to please the critics. \n\nThe play opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on December 4, 1986 and closed on September 25, 1988 after 756 performances.

Joan Rivers took over the role of Kate for the play's final months on Broadway. \n\nThe play received four Tony Award nominations, including Best Play, Linda Lavin (Lead Actress, Play), Phyllis Newman (Featured Actress, Play), and John Randolph (Featured Actor, Play). Linda Lavin won as Best Actress in a Play and John Randolph won as Best Featured Actor in a Play. It received four nominations for the Drama Desk Award, with Lavin and Randolph winning. \n\nIt also was a 1987 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\n\nA Broadway revival, directed by David Cromer, was scheduled to open in November 2009 (previews) at the Nederlander Theatre, running in repertory with \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\". The announced cast included Laurie Metcalf as Kate Jerome, Dennis Boutsikaris as Jack Jerome, Santino Fontana as Stanley Jerome, Jessica Hecht as Blanche, Josh Grisetti as Eugene Jerome and Allan Miller as Ben. However, \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" closed on November 1, 2009 due to weak ticket sales and the planned production of \"Broadway Bound\" was canceled.\n\n\"Broadway Bound\" was adapted into a television movie in 1992. The film was directed by Paul Bogart with the screenplay written by Neil Simon. The cast starred Anne Bancroft (Kate), Hume Cronyn (Ben), Jerry Orbach (Jack), Jonathan Silverman (Stan) and Corey Parker (Eugene). Cronyn won a 1992 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his role in the film.\n\nFrank Rich, in his review for \"The New York Times\" wrote: \" \"Broadway Bound\" contains some of its author's most accomplished writing to date – passages that dramatize the timeless, unresolvable bloodlettings of familial existence as well as the humorous conflicts one expects. But the seamless merging of laughter, character and emotion that ignited \"Biloxi Blues\" is only intermittently achieved here. There are stretches, especially in Act I, when \"Broadway Bound\" isn't funny or moving but just reportorial and expository, with plot twists and thematic invocations piling up undigested, like the heavier courses at an attenuated Passover seder.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "584935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=584935", "title": "City of license", "text": "City of license\n\nIn American, Canadian and Philippine broadcasting, a city of license or community of license is the community that a radio station or television station is officially licensed to serve by that country's broadcast regulator.\n\nIn North American broadcast law, the concept of \"community of license\" dates to the early days of AM radio broadcasting. The requirement that a broadcasting station operate a \"main studio\" within a prescribed distance of the community which the station is licensed to serve appears in U.S. law as early as 1939.\n\nVarious specific obligations have been applied to broadcasters by governments to fulfill public policy objectives of broadcast localism, both in radio and later also in television, based on the legislative presumption that a broadcaster fills a similar role to that held by community newspaper publishers.\n\nIn the United States, the Communications Act of 1934 requires that \"the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among the several States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same.\" The Federal Communications Commission interprets this as requiring that every broadcast station \"be licensed to the principal community or other political subdivision which it primarily serves.\" For each broadcast service, the FCC defines a standard for what it means to serve a community; for example, commercial FM radio stations are required to provide an field strength of at least 3.16 millivolts per meter (mV/m) over the entire land area of the community, whereas non-commercial educational FM stations need only provide a field strength of 1 mV/m over 50% of the community's population. This electric field contour is called the \"principal community contour\".\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) makes other requirements on stations relative to their communities of license; these requirements have varied over time. One example is the requirement for stations to identify themselves, by call sign and community, at sign-on, sign-off, and at the top of every hour of operation. Other current requirements include providing a local telephone number in the community's calling area (or else a toll-free number) and (in most cases) maintaining an official main studio within 25 miles of the community's geographic center.\n\nThe requirement that a station maintain a main studio within a station's primary coverage area or within a maximum distance of the community of license originated in an era in which stations were legally required to generate local content and the majority of a station's local, non-network programming was expected to originate in one central studio location. In this context, the view of broadcast regulators held that an expedient way to ensure that content broadcast reflected the needs of a local community was to allocate local broadcast stations and studios to each individual city.\n\nThe nominal main studio requirement has become less relevant with the introduction of videotape recorders in 1956 (which allowed local content to be easily generated off-site and transported to stations), the growing portability of broadcast-quality production equipment due to transistorization and the elimination of requirements (in 1987 for most classes of US broadcast stations) that broadcasters originate any minimum amount of local content.\n\nWhile the main studio concept nominally remains in US broadcast regulations, and certain administrative requirements (such as the local employment of a manager and the equivalent of at least one other full-time staff member, as well as the maintenance of a public inspection file) are still applied, removal of the requirement that stations originate local content greatly weakens the significance of maintaining a local main studio. A facility capable of originating programming and feeding it to a transmitter must still exist, but under normal conditions there most often is no requirement that these local studio actually be in active use to originate any specific local programming.\n\nIn many cases, the use of centralcasting and broadcast automation has greatly weakened the role and importance of manual control by staff at the nominal local station studio facilities.\n\nExceptions to these rules have been made by regulators, primarily on a case-by-case basis, to deal with \"satellite stations\": transmitters which are licensed to comply with the technical requirements of full service broadcast facilities and have their own independent call signs and communities of license but are used simply as full-power broadcast translators to rebroadcast another station. These are most often non-commercial educational stations or stations serving thinly populated areas which otherwise would be too small to support an independent local full-service broadcaster.\n\nThe requirement that a full-service station maintain local presence in its community of license has been used by proponents of localism and community broadcasting as a means to oppose the construction and use of local stations as mere rebroadcasters or satellite-fed translators of distant stations. Without specific requirements for service to the local community of license, stations could be constructed in large number by out-of-region broadcasters who feed transmitters via satellite and offer no local content.\n\nThere also has been a de facto preference by regulators to encourage the assignment of broadcast licenses to smaller cities which otherwise would have no local voice, instead of allowing all broadcast activity to be concentrated in large metropolitan areas already served by many existing broadcasters.\n\nWhen dealing with multiple competing US radio station applications, current FM allotment priorities are: (1) first full-time aural service; (2) second full-time aural service; (3) first local aural transmission service; and (4) Other public interest matters.\n\nSimilar criteria were extended to competing applicants for non-commercial stations by US legislation passed in 2000.\n\nAny policy favoring applicants for communities not already served by an existing station has had the unintended effect of encouraging applicants to merely list a small suburb of a large city, claiming to be the \"first station in the community\" even though the larger city is well served by many existing stations. \"The Suburban Community Problem\" was recognized in FCC policy as early as 1965. \"Stations in metropolitan areas often tend to seek out national and regional advertisers and to identify themselves with the entire metropolitan area rather than with the particular needs of their specified communities,\" according to an FCC policy statement of the era. In order \"to discourage applicants for smaller communities who would be merely substandard stations for neighboring, larger communities,\" the FCC established the so-called \"Suburban Community presumption\" which required applicants for AM stations in such markets to demonstrate that they had ascertained the unmet programming needs of the specific communities and were prepared to satisfy those needs.\n\nBy 1969, the same issues had spread to FM licensing; instead of building transmitters in the community to nominally be served, applicants would often seek to locate the tower site at least halfway to the next major city. In one such precedent case (the Berwick Doctrine), the FCC required a hearing before Berwick, a prospective broadcaster, could locate transmitters midway between Pittston, Pennsylvania (the city of license) and a larger audience in Wilkes-Barre.\n\nA related problem was that of 'move-in'. Outlying communities would find their small-town local stations sold to outsiders, who would then attempt to change the community of license to a suburb of the nearest major city, move transmitter locations or remove existing local content from broadcasts in an attempt to move into the larger city.\n\nThe small town of Anniston, Alabama, due to its location 90 miles west of Atlanta and 65 miles east of Birmingham, has lost local content from both TV and FM stations which were re-targeted at one of the two larger urban centers or moved outright. (WHMA-FM Anniston is now licensed as WNNX College Park, Georgia - an Atlanta suburb - after a failed attempt to relicense it to Sandy Springs, Georgia - another Atlanta suburb. Transmitters are now in downtown Atlanta.) \nThe same is true for WJSU, which served East Alabama with local news until the station was merged into a triplex to form ABC 33/40 which focuses its coverage on the central part of the state.\n\nA 1988 precedent case (Faye and Richard Tuck, 3 FCC Rcd 5374, 1988) created the \"Tuck Analysis\" as a standard which attempts to address the Suburban Community Problem on a case-by-case basis by examining:\n\nDespite the best intentions of regulators, the system remains prone to manipulation.\n\nWhile becoming less meaningful over the decades, stations are still required to post a public file somewhere within 25 miles of the city, and to cover the entire city with a local signal. In the United States, a station's transmitter must be located so that it can provide a strong signal over nearly all of its \"principal community\" (5 mV/m or stronger at night for AM stations, 70 dbuV for FM, 35 dbu for DTV channels 2-6, 43 dbu for channels 7-13 and 48 dbu for channels 14+), even if it primarily serves another city. For example, American television station WTTV primarily serves Indianapolis; however, the transmitter is located farther south than the other stations in that city because it is licensed to Bloomington, 50 miles south of Indianapolis. In some cases, such as Jeannette, Pennsylvania-licensed WPCW 19, the FCC has waived this requirement; the station claimed that retaining an existing transmitter site 25.6 miles southeast of its new community of license of Jeannette would be in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements (avoiding interference to co-channel WOIO 19 Shaker Heights). Another extreme example of a station's transmitter located far from the city of license is the FM station KPNT, formerly licensed to Ste. Genevieve, Missouri and transmitting from Hillsboro, but serving the St. Louis and Metro East market to the north. In 2015, the station was allowed by the FCC to move their city of license to Collinsville, Illinois and have a transmitter in St. Louis proper with a power decrease.\n\nFCC regulations also require stations at least once an hour to state the station's call letters, followed by the city of license. However, the FCC has no restrictions on additional names after the city of license, so many stations afterwards add the nearest large city. For example, American television station WOIO is licensed to Shaker Heights, a suburb of Cleveland. It is identified as \"WOIO DT Shaker Heights-Cleveland.\" Similarly, northern New York's WWNY identifies as WWNY-TV 7 Carthage-Watertown as a historical artifact; the original broadcasts originated from Champion Hill in 1954 so the license still reflects this tiny location.\n\nIf the station is licensed in the primary city served, on occasion the station will list a second city next to it. For example, American television station WTVT, licensed to Tampa, Florida, its primary city, identifies as \"WTVT/WTVT-DT Tampa/St. Petersburg\", as St. Petersburg is another major city in the market.\n\nThere is no longer a requirement to carry programs relevant to the particular community, or even necessarily to operate or transmit from that community. Accordingly, stations licensed to smaller communities in major metropolitan markets often target programming toward the entire market rather than the official home community, and often move their studio facilities to the larger urban centre as well. For instance, the Canadian radio station CFNY-FM is officially licensed to Brampton, Ontario, although its studio and transmitter facilities are located in downtown Toronto.\n\nThis may, at times, lead to confusion — while media directories normally list broadcast stations by their legal community of license, audiences often disregard (or may even be entirely unaware of) the distinction.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Communications Commission maintains a Table of Allotments, which assigns individual channel frequencies to individual cities or communities for both TV and FM radio.\n\nA corresponding Table of Allotments for digital television was created in 1997. To operate a licensed station, a broadcaster must first obtain allocation of the desired frequencies in the FCC's Table of Allotments for the intended city of license. This process is subject to various political and bureaucratic restrictions, based on considerations including the number of existing stations in the area.\n\nThe term \"city\" has in some cases been relaxed to mean \"community\", often including the unincorporated areas around the city that share a mailing address. This sometimes leads to inconsistencies, such as the licensing of one metro Atlanta station to the unincorporated Cobb County community of Mableton, but the refusal to license another to Sandy Springs, which is one of the largest cities in the state, and was at the time an unincorporated part of Fulton County only for political reasons in the Georgia General Assembly.\n\nThe definition of a \"community\" also comes into play when a broadcaster wants to take a station away from a tiny hamlet like North Pole, New York whose population is in decline. In general, regulators are loath to allow a community's only licence to be moved away - especially to a city which already has a station (a rare few exceptions were made to accommodate the then-fledgling third-rank American Broadcasting Company in the 1950s). A broadcaster may make the case that the \"community\" functionally no longer exists in order to be released from its local obligations. \n\nOften, the city of license does not correspond to the location of the station itself, of the primary audience or of the communities identified in the station's branding and advertising.\n\nSome of the more common reasons for a community of license to be listed as a point far from the actual audience include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Several fairs in the United States feature demolition derbies using combines, including events in Nebraska, Iowa, , Michigan, Ohio, North Dakota, Washington, and Illinois.\nDerbies sometimes last for up to three hours. Competitors typically remove heavy or unneeded parts of the combines before competitions and reinforce the front, or header, of the vehicle. A vehicle is deemed eliminated once its header section is destroyed or the combine is immobilized. Competitors attempt to use the header to pop other vehicle's tires, rupture their drive belts, or tear off their header. The competitions can end in ties if the only remaining machines become inextricably tangled together. The competition in Lind, Washington often includes multiple heats, including rounds for event veterans, rookies, and consolation rounds for losers. In Michigan, there is a derby circuit with competitions in several towns.\n\nCompetitors use old worn-out combines for the competitions; the use of new combines would be prohibitively expensive. Many, but not all, of the contestants are farmers. Some of the combines used date from the 1960s. The vehicles used in competition often are tall and weigh up to . Some competitions enforce rules about the height of the header, tire standards, age of the contestants, and the location and contents of the gas tank. Most combines are given colorful nicknames by their owners. Many combine owners elaborately decorate their combines. Prizes are sometimes awarded for most impressively decorated combine. Though some competitions offer prizes of $1,500, it is expensive to modify and maintain the combines and some winners lose money overall.\n\nThough the events are usually safe, during the 1999 event in Lind, one competitor suffered a broken leg after falling from his combine. This event led to more rules being enforced at the event, including a prohibition on concrete filled headers.\n"}

It was selected as South Korea's submission to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. The film follows the journey of a North Korean man as he illegally leaves the country to find medicine for his sick wife, portraying the many hardships of the average North Korean citizen. The film had 907,255 admissions in South Korea.\n\nThe politics of North Korea in this film are left behind and are mainly in the background. Instead it concentrates more on the life of the average North Korean, such as the hardship in an impoverished state and the fear of getting caught and being persecuted in North Korea. Subtle themes include religion, which runs through the film, as Yong Soo hopes that his son comes back safely, as well as football which is a way in connecting the North Koreans to the outside world.\n\nThe story tells of a North Korean father and husband who decides to illegally cross into China to buy medicine for his pregnant wife who is suffering from tuberculosis. However, once he crosses into China, he realises that it's not as easy as he thought. He finds himself working as an illegal immigrant under the constant threat of being captured by the Chinese authorities and deported back to North Korea. He eventually finds his way to South Korea by entering the German embassy in China. Meanwhile, his wife has already died, leaving their son homeless and wandering around trying to find a way back to his father.

He argued that the film was written on a screenplay titled \"The Conditions of Human\" based on the story of North Korean defector Yoo Sang-joon which he wrote. Lee's lawyer also said that director Lee and Yoo had signed a contract to make a film about Yoo's life and has been preparing for the past three years. The lawyer claimed that a court injunction was sought because director Kim has not discussed the matter with director Lee, although Kim had known about the existence of a screenplay about Yoo. The request for an injunction applies to all theater presentations, as well as in the forms of DVD, video, and internet videos. Vantage Holdings, the distributor of \"Crossing\" has countered the accusation by saying that the director nor the film company has not violated Lee's copyright and added that they are looking into taking legal measures themselves.\n\nThe film has also been selected as South Korea's submission to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.

The Inquisitor assembles the titular Inquisition in an attempt to stop Corypheus, an ancient darkspawn, who opened the breach in an attempt to conquer Thedas.\n\nGameplay of \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" is similar to its predecessors and mostly consists of elements found in a typical action role-playing game; players control their customized Inquisitor, and the companions they meet. They can defeat enemies with swords and magic, complete side quests, interact with non-playable characters, and progress through the main story. Players mainly control their protagonists in a third-person view, though a traditional role-playing game top down camera angle is also available.\n\nAfter the release of \"Dragon Age II\", the \"Dragon Age\" series was seen by some as a series with an \"identity crisis\". As a result, Bioware sought to create a third \"Dragon Age\" game that combined the elements of the first two. Having begun development in 2011, the game was officially announced at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The game's soundtrack was primarily composed by Trevor Morris, who replaced Inon Zur, the composer of the \"Dragon Age: Origins\" and \"Dragon Age II\" soundtracks. Several downloadable content expansion packs were also released.\n\n\"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising its story, voice acting, soundtrack, detailed environments, and engaging combat. The game did receive some criticism for the presence of technical issues. It was awarded over 150 year-end accolades and nominated for more, including Game of the Year and Best Role-playing awards from several gaming publications.\n\n\"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" is an action role-playing game similar to its predecessors. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses a race for their player character: human, dwarf, elf, are playable races, with Qunari playable for the first time. Players customize the Inquisitor's physical appearance, and gender, among other things. Players choose from three classes, warrior, mage, and rogue, and can specialize their character, which grant them specific abilities. The character would later evolve to become the Inquisitor of Thedas, who is considered \"holy\" by the citizens there. As the Inquisitor, players had to make choices and decisions that affect and change the game's world state. In addition, they can \"judge\" certain people on their behaviors and decide their fate. Thedas is the game's world, which includes Ferelden, where \"\" was set, as well as three new unexplored regions, which include Orlais, Nevarra and the Free Marches. The game is not an open world video game, as the world is broken up into several sections, which can be freely explored by players. Despite that, BioWare claimed that one of the levels featured in \"Inquisition\" is larger than the entire game of \"Dragon Age II\". In addition, each region features different environments like deserts, swamps, and mountains. In order to allow players to navigate the game's world faster, mounts, which are creatures that can be ridden by players, are introduced.\n\nThe romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to the previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs occur in reaction to story events and variables specific to each character and include sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex. Josephine, for example does not have an explicit sex scene with the inquisitor during the main plot. Among the nine companions, who assist players in battle, and three advisers, eight of them can be romanced. Some of these party members would decide whether to fall in love with the Inquisitor based on their gender and race.\n\nCustomization was significantly overhauled, specifically by allowing equipment and other items to modify their appearance based on who it is equipped to. Depending upon which party member has received it, a piece of armour would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining their identity. Players can craft and customize armour or weapons using the materials they have collected; rarer materials give the particular weapon or armour piece better attributes. Players can customize their keeps, such as rebuilding a garden as a Chantry church or a herb garden. These upgrades have minor effects on the Inquisitions espionage, commerce or military capabilities.\n\nPlayers do not have the ability to import their save files from the first two games into \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" \"to shore up world consistency\". Instead, Bioware released a cloud-based online interactive story creator called \"Dragon Age Keep\", which is narrated by Varric. Players can detail the major plots of the previous two \"Dragon Age\" games to provide this level of customization without requiring replay of the initial games.\n\nPlayers gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort or establishing camps, which are used to provide fast travel and resupply points. Operations can be discovered to repair various structures and pathways, such as bridges or collapsed caves. These operations will allow exploration of previously unreachable locations and side quests.\nCombat focuses on the player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with their party members. \"Inquisition\" features two forms of combat systems. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action role-playing games, including \"Dragon Age II\". During combat, players can switch to control other party members, while artificial intelligence will take control of the Inquisitor and other members in the party. This system is action-oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of classic role-playing games, including \"Dragon Age: Origins\". This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the party members and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused. The Inquisitor also has the ability to close and manipulate the rift, which can stun all the enemies nearby.\n\nAs the Inquisitor, players influence how to deploy agents and troops of the Inquisition through their primary advisers, which influences the rewards and time requirements of the effort undertaken. The various regions that make up the game world do not scale in level. They have a fixed level, which means players can be either too weak or strong for the enemies found in that region.\n\n\"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" also introduces multiplayer, which is described as a \"dungeon crawling experience\" by BioWare. The game features a co-operative multiplayer mode which tasks players to play as an Agent of the Inquisition. Players had to play through levels, and to fight against increasingly difficult AI. The mode can be played with three other players, or be completed solo. At launch, the game features three multiplayer campaign and nine playable characters. The mode is completely separated from the main campaign. As a result, the progress made by the player in the multiplayer mode would not carry to the campaign. Players can upgrade and craft items, and unlock new characters in the multiplayer mode. Since time is needed to unlock new characters, micro-transactions are featured. Players can purchase an in-game currency called Platinum to speed up the process of unlocking new characters.\n\n\"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" is set in the continent of Thedas, the fantasy world in which the two previous games are set. The game covers more geographic territory than its predecessors, with one map being described as four to five times the size of Ferelden, the setting of the first game in the series. The setting overhaul allows the players to go back and forth between Ferelden and Orlais. Following the events described in the supplementary novels \"Dragon Age: Asunder\" and \"The Masked Empire\", a civil war between the loyalists of the ruling Empress and a powerful noble faction led by her cousin, Grand Duke Gaspard, broke out in Orlais. Simultaneously, the Circle of Magi has gone rogue, in part due to the events of \"Dragon Age II\", and the Templar Order seceded from the Chantry to wage their own civil war on the mages.\n\nThe area traversable in \"Inquisition\" is much larger than both \"Dragon Age: Origins\" and \"Dragon Age II\", and is said to cover two countries and the land between. The countries are: Ferelden (setting of \"Dragon Age: Origins\") and Orlais, with a land known as the Dales located within.\n\nReturning characters from the previous games include Cullen, Leliana, Cassandra Pentaghast and Varric Tethras, the latter two serving as player companions, the former two serving as the Inquisition's military commander and spymaster, respectively. New companions introduced include Solas, an elven apostate mage well-versed in the Fade and spirits; Blackwall, an Orlesian Grey Warden recruiter; Sera, an elven thief and member of a clandestine society called the Friends of Red Jenny; Iron Bull, a Qunari warrior leading a mercenary company called the Bull's Chargers, and agent of the Ben-Hassrath spies; Vivienne, a loyalist Circle Mage from Orlais; Dorian, a mage from the Tevinter Imperium; and Cole, a spirit of compassion who has taken the form of a deceased human mage. Josephine Montilyet, an Antivan noblewoman and diplomat, serves as the Inquisition's ambassador.\n\nIn 9:41, the mage-templar war is temporarily halted during the Conclave, a peace conference orchestrated by Divine Justinia. During the negotiations, an explosion destroys the Conclave, killing the Divine and many senior Chantry clerics, along with many mages and templars, and creates the Breach, a massive hole in the Veil, the magical boundary between the physical world and the Fade, the world of spirits. The only survivor of the blast is the player character, who emerges from a rift with a mark on their hand capable of closing the rifts that have sprung up in the Breach's wake, but no memory of what happened.\n\nAfter assisting Cassandra in closing several rifts, the player begins to be referred to as the \"Herald of Andraste\". With the Chantry leaderless, Cassandra and Leliana re-establish its predecessor, the Inquisition, to carry out one of the Divine's last orders. They resolve to establish authority, close the Breach, and defeat its creator. After gaining the assistance of either the mages or the templars, the Herald succeeds in closing the Breach. During a victory celebration, Haven is attacked by a corrupted version of whichever faction the player did not side with. The attackers are led by Corypheus, an ancient Tevinter magister turned darkspawn who was responsible for opening the Breach. Aided by a dragon that appears to be an Archdemon, Corypheus overcomes Haven's defences and forces the Inquisition to flee.\n\nConfronting the Herald, Corypheus refers to the mark as \"the Anchor\", the means by which he would physically enter the Fade and claim the Maker's throne in the Black City, attaining apotheosis for himself. He attempts to remove the Anchor with a magical elven orb, only to discover that the Anchor is permanently attached; the Herald escapes Corypheus by setting off an avalanche that buries Haven and decimates Corypheus's army. The Herald regroups with other survivors of the attack, and Solas leads the Inquisition to the abandoned and forgotten fortress of Skyhold, high in the mountains, which becomes their new base. The player character becomes the Inquisitor, leader of the Inquisition.\n\nWith the assistance of Hawke, who fled Kirkwall after \"Dragon Age II\", the Inquisitor investigates the disappearance of the Grey Wardens, discovering that they were being manipulated by Corypheus into raising a demon army. Hawke and the Inquisitor are assisted by a Grey Warden in hiding; either Alistair, Loghain, or Stroud (depending on choices made in \"\"). The Inquisitor reenters the Fade and regains memories of the Conclave, which reveal that the Inquisitor obtained the Anchor upon coming into contact with Corypheus's orb, after stumbling on a ritual carried out by enthralled Grey Wardens to unlock the orb's power. Either the Grey Warden or Hawke gives their life to help the others escape the Fade, and the Inquisitor must decide whether to exile or recruit the remaining Wardens.\n\nThe Inquisitor also attends a ball at the Winter Palace and resolves the ongoing civil war in Orlais. Morrigan, an advisor to the Empress, joins the Inquisition as Imperial liaison. Following her advice, the Inquisitor travels to the Temple of Mythal in order to stop Corypheus from obtaining an Eluvian, a powerful artifact which would enable him to physically enter the Fade. The Inquisitor witnesses Corypheus seemingly destroyed by the temple's defenses, only for him to be reborn in the body of a nearby Grey Warden. Taking refuge inside the temple, either the Inquisitor or Morrigan gains the powers of the Well of Sorrows, the magical 'key' to the resident Eluvian, providing the recipient wisdom of previous servants of Mythal but also binding them to her will. Mythal is revealed to be Flemeth, the Witch of the Wilds. If Morrigan conceived a child in \"Origins\" with the soul of an Old God, the soul is taken by Flemeth.\n\nIn either case, voices from the Well reveal that Corypheus' dragon is the key to stopping him; it is a facsimile of an Archdemon, which, if killed, would disrupt Corypheus' ability to leap into other bodies and leave him vulnerable. The Inquisitor then confronts Corypheus as he reopens the Breach and defeats him and his dragon, resealing the Breach permanently and hurling the darkspawn magister to the Fade, destroying his physical body in the process. After finding Corypheus's orb destroyed, a dismayed Solas departs the Inquisition. The epilogue, narrated by Morrigan, details the outcomes of the Inquisitor's decisions for the Mage-Templar war, the Grey Wardens, and the leadership of Orlais. Also, depending on the player's choices, either Cassandra, Leliana, or Vivienne will succeed Justinia as Divine Victoria.\n\nIn the post-epilogue, Flemeth meets with Solas, who is revealed to be Fen'Harel, the elven god of betrayal. Their conversation reveals that Solas had given his orb to Corypheus, since he was too weak to unlock the orb's true power after his slumber. Though remorseful for his actions and recognizing that he deserves punishment, Solas deems himself too important to be killed, claiming that the elves need him. As Flemeth embraces Solas, his eyes begin to glow and he seemingly absorbs Mythal into himself.\n\nTwo years after the defeat of Corypheus, the Inquisition goes to the Winter Palace to engage in talks regarding its future; Ferelden wishes the organisation disbanded, while Orlais wants to incorporate it into its armed forces. During the negotiations, a dead Qunari appears, leading the Inquisitor to discover a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, referred to as \"Dragon's Breath\". Qunari agents within the Inquisition would smuggle barrels of gaatlock (the Qunari equivalent of gunpowder) into seats of power and governance across southern Thedas, allowing the Qunari to wipe out its leadership and facilitate an invasion. They also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plans. Concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life.\n\nWhile investigating the Qunari plot, the Inquisitor learns that the elven gods, the Evanuris, were in truth extremely powerful mages from ancient times who became corrupt and arrogant in their power, and that Fen'Harel had led a rebellion against them. They also learn that the Veil was created by Fen'Harel, and that his doing so caused the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. The Inquisitor can also learn that Fen'Harel is Solas, depending on how well they search.\n\nThe Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari in charge of Dragon's Breath who claims that the Qunari instigated it in order to prevent an incident like the Breach's appearance - which they blamed on the south's failure to adequately control mages - from being repeated. After the Inquisitor foils the plot, they convince the Viddasala that they are not Fen Harel's agents, and the Viddasala in turn reveals that Solas is the agent of Fen'Harel who has been disrupting the Dragon's Breath plot, unaware that they are one and the same. She pursues Solas into the Eluvian network, with the Inquisitor following, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control. Ultimately, the Viddasala is petrified by Solas.\n\nSolas temporarily calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor, confessing to being Fen'Harel and creating the Veil in order to seal away the Evanuris after they assassinated Mythal, the only one who kept their ambition in check. He also reveals his intentions to restore the world of ancient elves, even if he must destroy the present world. If asked about his role in the events of the core story, Solas explains that he had arranged for Corypheus to obtain his magical orb, hoping he would unlock it and kill himself in the subsequent explosion, after which Solas would retrieve the orb, use the Anchor to tear down the Veil, and restore the ancient elven world. After Corypheus instead survived the blast, Solas joined the Inquisition, seeing them as the best hope of defeating him. If questioned about why he arranged for Dragon's Breath to be discovered, he will either state his desire to avoid unnecessary bloodshed or, if he is friends with the Inquisitor, admit that he sees value in the present world. Ultimately, Solas amputates the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaves, with the Inquisitor either resolving to stop him by any means necessary, or convince him to abandon his plan.\n\nUpon returning to the Winter Palace, the Inquisitor must either disband the Inquisition or repurpose it to serve Divine Victoria, risking either weaker efforts against Solas or corruption in the ranks. An epilogue reveals that the Qunari resumed their war with Tevinter following their failed plot, and that elves across Thedas have disappeared to join Solas, in addition to detailing the fates of the Inquisitor's allies. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, and plans to gather allies in Tevinter, noting that given Solas's familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition, they need to recruit people he has not encountered before.\n\nDeveloper BioWare was planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, \"\" and \"Dragon Age II\", into the creation of \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\". The game features larger environments with more opportunity for exploration. \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" was first informally announced on Twitter, on May 19, 2011, by BioWare's creative lead Alistair McNally. The core idea for \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\", namely that there would be an inquisition and the player character would be its leader, was originally intended to be the follow-up to \"Dragon Age: Origins\".\n\nOn March 19, 2012, nearly two weeks after BioWare released \"Mass Effect 3\", creative director Mike Laidlaw tweeted that BioWare was finished working on content for \"Dragon Age II\". Executive producer Mark Darrah mentioned that BioWare originally had plans for an expansion pack, entitled \"Exalted March\", to mark the first anniversary of \"Dragon Age II\" but canceled it in favor of developing other opportunities for the series. Although \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" had not been officially announced, Darrah asked fans to give feedback on what they would like to see in future \"Dragon Age\" installments.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter speculated that \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" would be released some time in 2014. The title was believed to be scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of 2013, but Pachter suggested it had been delayed so BioWare and video game publisher Electronic Arts could fix problems and create new content for \"\" and \"Mass Effect 3\". However, many BioWare developers, such as Mary Kirby, claimed this was inaccurate, stating that \"\"Dragon Age III\"s development will not be delayed by BioWare's other games.\"\n\nThe game's development faced several challenges. Criticism of \"Dragon Age II\" added pressure to make the next game a success. The decision was made to switch from the Eclipse engine used in the first two series installments to Frostbite. Frostbite had been used to make \"Battlefied\" and other first-person shooters and did not have any of the required tools for an RPG, like save functions or inventory management systems. Consequently, the \"Dragon Age: Inquistion\" team had to build these features at the same time as they were creating the new game. Art director Matt Goldman said of development, \"Basically we had to do new consoles, a new engine, new gameplay, build the hugest game that we've ever made, and build it to a higher standard than we ever did, with tools that don't exist.\"\n\nIn September 2012, Mark Darrah, \"Dragon Age\"s executive producer, revealed in an open letter that \"Dragon Age III\", titled \"Dragon Age III: Inquisition\", was officially under development and had been since about eighteen months previous to the announcement.\n\nAt E3 2013, it was announced along with the trailer that the game would debut \"Fall 2014\" and that the title would be \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\", dropping the \"III\". Later in 2013, it was confirmed that the PC was the lead development platform.\n\nOn March 6, 2014, BioWare released a trailer for \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" entitled \"Discover the Dragon Age\", showcasing some of the landscapes that can be explored while playing the game. On April 22, 2014, BioWare released a trailer for \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" featuring gameplay from the game and confirming an October 7, 2014 release date. On June 9, 2014, at E3 2014, BioWare released a third trailer for \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\", entitled \"Lead Them or Fall\", revealing more elements of the game's storyline. On July 22, 2014, BioWare pushed back the game's release date to November 18, 2014. BioWare confirmed on October 31, 2014 that \"Inquisition\" had declared gold, indicating it was being prepared for duplication and release.\n\nRay Muzyka, BioWare's former CEO, said in an interview with Wired.com that \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" would be influenced by more open world games, such as \"\", which BioWare is \"checking out aggressively\". The developers stated that they would no longer reuse environments, which was considered a main issue in \"Dragon Age II\".\n\nOn August 27, 2014, BioWare announced that \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" would have a four-player co-op mode that is separate from the single-player mode.\n\nOn November 13, 2014, Electronic Arts announced that Xbox One owners can play the six-hour trial version of the game starting from the same day via EA Access. On November 18, 2014, Electronic Arts announced that there would not be an Indian version of the game in order to \"avoid a breach of local content laws\". \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" was then added to the vault of EA Access for the Xbox One on August 4, 2015. In July 2015, Electronic Arts released a trial for the game, which allows players to play the game's single-player for free for six hours and gain \"unlimited access\" to the multiplayer portion of the game via Origin.\n\nA competition, called \"Untold Relics of Thedas Contest\" was launched by BioWare in July 2015. The competition tasks participants to design a new item, whose name, backstory and attributes can be changed. A \"Dragon Age\" prize packs will be given to the winner of the contest, and the item designed by the winner will be added to the game via a future content pack.\n\nThe game's \"Game of the Year\" Edition was announced on September 22, 2015. The Edition features the base game bundled with all the previously released story-based downloadable content. (\"The Descent\", \"Jaws of Hakkon\" and \"Trespasser\") The edition also includes items from the \"Spoils of the Avvar\", \"Spoils of the Qunari\" add-ons, and content from the \"Deluxe Edition\". It is released on October 6, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nThree packs of downloadable content (DLC) were released. On July 6, 2015, it was announced by Electronic Arts that future DLCs will not be released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. As a result, a new feature that allows PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 players to import and transfer their saves to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One was released on the same day.\n\nOn March 23, 2015, the first DLC, titled \"Jaws of Hakkon\", was announced by BioWare and Electronic Arts. It includes new types of armor, weapons and enemies, as well as a new region called Frostback Basin. It was released on March 24, 2015 for the Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. The PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the DLC were released on May 26, 2015.\n\nOn May 1, 2015, a free multiplayer downloadable content titled \"Dragonslayer\" was announced. It adds a new multiplayer map called Ferelden Castle and three new playable characters, namely Amund the Sky Watcher, Zither the Virtuoso and Isabela. The \"Dragonslayer\" DLC was released alongside \"The Black Emporium\" DLC, which introduces the shop and \"Mirror of Transformation\", which allow players to change their appearance, on May 5, 2015.\n\n\"Spoils of the Avvar\" is a bundle pack that features new types of mount, armor and customization. The pack was released worldwide on June 9, 2015 for Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.\n\n\"The Descent\" is the second single-player downloadable content for the game. Players play as the Inquisitor, and have to venture to the Deep Roads to investigate an earthquake that threatened the lives of all citizens in Thedas. New characters are introduced in this DLC. Announced on August 5, 2015, \"The Descent\" was released on August 11, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\n\"Trespasser\" is the third and the last single-player downloadable content for the game. Players continue to assume the role of the Inquisitor, and have to face against a Qunari invasion and reestablish the authority of the Inquisition. The \"Trespasser\" DLC is set two years after the original game's ending. New wardrobe options and a Golden Nug statue, which allows players to keep all their acquired schematics and recipes, are also introduced in this downloadable content. It was announced during PAX Prime on August 29, 2015, and was released on September 8, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. According to BioWare, the team took inspirations from \"Indiana Jones\" and \"Captain America\" to create the game's story.\n\nTrevor Morris replaced Inon Zur, the composer of \"Dragon Age: Origins\" and \"Dragon Age II\" to compose the soundtracks for \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\". The change was due to the desire in presenting players a \"new experience\" yet keeping familiar themes for those who enjoyed the music in previous versions. The development of the music started earlier than the other aspects of the game. The album was released digitally on November 17, 2014, a day before the game's official release.\n\nIn addition to the original soundtrack, the game also features 10 tavern songs, which were composed by Raney Shockne and performed by Elizaveta and Nick Stoubis. One of the soundtrack, \"I Am The One\" was composed by Inon Zur. The tavern songs, along with the song sheets were made free to download from January 26, 2015 to February 9, 2015 by BioWare due to massive fan demand. The songs will also be sold through various digital platform in the future.\n\nPre-release comments of \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" were positive. Kotaku writer Jason Schrier had very good first impressions, noting the game's apparent ambition and BioWare's ability to listen to fans. GamesRadar listed the game as their second best shown at PAX 2013, commenting on its openness and combat. John Walker of Rock, Paper, Shotgun was pleased to hear of the top-view camera coming back, though remained cautious; after playing the demo, he said he was \"left optimistic, but uninformed\". \"Game Informer\"s Kimberley Wallace listed it as one of the most anticipated RPGs to be released in 2014, saying \"\"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" has a lot to prove after BioWare received plenty of feedback from disappointed fans about \"Dragon Age II\". However, if our cover trip was any indication, BioWare is up for the challenge.\"\n\nGamecritics writer Brad Gallaway gave a hands on preview and was less impressed stating \"for me personally, this was not the kind of content I was hoping to see\" and mentioning graphical issues, lack of interest in the characters and the amount of random quests given within a few short minutes.\n\n\"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" received \"Generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nAlexander Sliwinski from Joystiq gave the game a perfect score. He described the game as \"an immense fantasy epic, a sprawling adventure across the many landscapes of Thedas, unapologetically mature in its exploration of politics and brazen in its combat, It's everything that a sequel to \"\" should have been.\" He also described the game as \"the redemption song of the developer BioWare\". Adam Beck from \"Hardcore Gamer\" also awarded \"Inquisition\" a perfect score, saying that while \"the artistic and visual fidelity help with immersion, it's the branching, player driven storyline and exquisitely layered combat system\" that make the game special. Philip Kollar from \"Polygon\" gave the game a 9.5/10. He praised the well-written characters, engrossing plot cliffhangers, tightly-connected story, as well as the combat system, as he described it as \"a smart blend of the combat systems from \"Origins\" and \"Dragon Age 2\" which makes those long stretches exploring the wilderness fun.\" Joe Juba from \"Game Informer\" also gave the game a 9.5/10. He praised the detailed environments, character models and spell effects, excellent voice acting and soundtracks, responsive combat and high replay value, but criticizing the disappointing center story arc, lack of a storage chest and multiple weapons sets, as well as some minor crashes and audio bugs. However, he still stated that \"With the mixture of open-world exploration, entertaining combat, and top-tier characters, the team at BioWare has found a winning formula that isn't shackled to either \"Dragon Age: Origins\" or \"Dragon Age II\". \"Inquisition\" is not defined by the traditions it returns to, but by the new directions it forges for this magnificent fantasy universe.\"\n\nPhil Savage from \"PC Gamer\" praised the rich content, fulfilling, dramatic and memorable plot, as well as the tough yet world-shifting decisions made throughout the game. However, he criticized the slow animation for the rogue career, as well as the tactical view, which could be confusing when encountering multiple enemies. He stated that such small yet noticeable flaws made \"Inquisition\" imperfect. Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot gave the game a 9/10. He praised the wonderful cast of interesting and relatable characters, overarching narrative, diverse environments, as well as the fantastic balance between exploration, combat, story, and customization. Yet, he criticized the combat system, which required relatively less strategy. Vince Ingenito from IGN gave the game a 8.8/10. He praised the substantial replay value from the multiplayer, as well as surprisingly huge, dense and detailed world. However, he criticized the weak and less compelling story, as well as numerous technical issues encountered. He described the game as \"not only one of the most expansive RPGs I've ever played, but one of the few that successfully fills its gorgeous, massive world with meaningful things to do and see. A frustratingly vague plot and typical BioWare bugginess drag it down a bit, but both in combat and out, \"Inquisition\" marks a welcome return to the RPG depth that made Bioware's previous products \"Dragon Age: Origins\" and \"\" so magnetic.\"\n\nBoth Bajo and Hex from \"Good Game\" gave the game 10/10, the only such score they handed out in 2014. Both hosts praised the game's writing, voice acting, graphics, and gameplay, with Hex saying that \"the writing and voice acting is just excellent\" and that \"Those sword and board hits though Bajo! So rewarding! It's classic dungeon crawling combat isn't it?\". Bajo praised the game's challenge, stating that \"where the combat truly shines is when you're in trouble\" as well as offering a minor criticism that \"The crafting system is a little hard to get your head around\". They also awarded it \"Game of the Year\" in their annual Christmas special.\n\nFollowing the launch of the game, BioWare announced that it was working on patches to address fanbase concerns regarding the PC version including driver support, graphics, and interface.\n\"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" debuted at No. 5 in UK in its first launch week. According to retail monitor Chart-Track, it had sold almost the exact amount of launch week copies as 2011's \"Dragon Age II\". This does not take into account direct digital download sales however, which have been noted to be a \"significant percentage of sales\" by BioWare and thus the true number of sales is higher. According to Electronic Arts' fiscal 2015 third quarter earnings report, \"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" is the most successful launch in BioWare history based on units sold.\n\n\"Dragon Age: Inquisition\" has received numerous awards and nominations from gaming publications.

{"id": "23181138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23181138", "title": "Hispanic–Latino naming dispute", "text": "Hispanic–Latino naming dispute\n\nThe Hispanic–Latino naming dispute is an ongoing disagreement over the use of the ethnonyms \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\" to refer collectively to the inhabitants of the United States of America who are of Latin American or Spanish origin—that is, Latino or Hispanic Americans. The usage of both terms has changed to adapt to a wide range of geographical and historical influences. The term \"Hispanic\" was used first; later, some Hispanics in the western United States came to prefer the term \"Latino\". The Census does not classify persons of Portuguese or Brazilian descent as Hispanic, as those are Portuguese-speaking populations. According to a 2011 study by the Pew Research Center, the majority (51%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans prefer to identify with their families' country of origin, while only 24% prefer the terms \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\".\n\nWhile the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, \"Hispanic\" is a narrower term that only refers to persons of Spanish-speaking origin or ancestry, while \"Latino\" is more frequently used to refer generally to anyone of Latin American origin or ancestry, including Brazilians. \"Hispanic\" thus includes persons from Spain and Spanish-speaking Latin Americans but excludes Portuguese and Brazilians. Because Brazil's population of 191,000,000 is several times larger than Spain's population of 47,000,000 and because there are more Brazilian-born Americans (325,547 as of 2012) than Spanish-born Americans (88,665 as of 2012) in the United States, \"Latino\" is a broader term encompassing more people. The choice between the terms among those of Spanish-speaking origin is associated with location: persons of Spanish-speaking origin residing in the eastern United States tend to prefer \"Hispanic\", whereas those in the west tend to prefer \"Latino\".\n\nIn Latin America, the term \"latino\" is not a common endonym and as a demonym is restricted to the Latin American-descended population of the United States. \"Latino\" as a category used in the United States may be understood as a shorthand for the Spanish word or the Portuguese phrase , thus excluding speakers of Romance languages from Europe. Both \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\" are generally used to denote people living in the United States, so that \"outside the United States, we don't speak of Latinos; we speak of Mexicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and so forth.\"\n\nThe term \"Hispanic\" was adopted by the United States government in the early 1970s during the administration of Richard Nixon after the Hispanic members of an interdepartmental Ad Hoc Committee to develop racial and ethnic definitions recommended that a universal term encompassing all Hispanic subgroups—including Central and South Americans—be adopted. As the 1970 census did not include a question on Hispanic origin on all census forms—instead relying on a sample of the population via an extended form (\"Is this person's origin or descent: Mexican; Puerto Rican; Cuban; Central or South American; Other Spanish; or None of these\"), the members of the committee wanted a common designation to better track the social and economic progress of the group vis-à-vis the general population. The designation has since been used in local and federal employment, mass media, academia, and business market research. It has been used in the U.S. Census since 1980. Because of the popularity of \"Latino\" in the western portion of the United States, the government adopted this term as well in 1997, and used it in the 2000 census.\n\nPreviously, Hispanic and Latino Americans were categorized as \"Spanish-Americans\", \"Spanish-speaking Americans\", or \"Spanish-surnamed Americans\". However:\n\n\nThe term \"Hispanic\" actually refers to \"Hispania\"—a large geographical area notably recognized in the Roman era. It consists of the entire Iberian peninsula, not just the modern-day state of Spain. Thus, the more recent division between the modern-day states of Spain and Portugal arguably has no bearing on these terms. (In this manner, Brazilians would be considered Hispanic.) Additionally, the term \"Latin America\" () is a relatively recent invention by the French in the 19th century, intended to promote all Latin-based European interests and influence in the Western Hemisphere—further highlighting a clear and arguably erroneous inconsistency if excluding Quebec, modern French Louisiana, the French Caribbean, and French Guiana from the terms \"Latin America\" or \"Latino\". Ultimately, one may use the term \"Hispanic America\" instead.\n\nThe term \"Hispanic\" has been the source of several debates in the USA. Within the U.S., the term originally referred typically to the Hispanos of New Mexico until the U.S. government used it in the 1970 Census to refer to \"a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.\" The OMB did not accept the recommendation to retain the single term \"Hispanic\". Instead, the OMB has decided that the term should be \"Hispanic or Latino\" because regional usage of the terms differs. Hispanic is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States, whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion of the United States. Since the 2000 Census, the identifier has changed from \"Hispanic\" to \"Spanish/Hispanic/Latino\".\n\nOther federal and local government agencies and non-profit organizations include Brazilians and Portuguese in their definition of \"Hispanic:. The US Department of Transportation defines \"Hispanic\" as \"persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American, or others [of] Spanish or Portuguese culture or origin, regardless of race.\" This definition has been adopted by the Small Business Administration as well as by many federal, state, and municipal agencies for the purposes of awarding government contracts to minority-owned businesses.\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC)—which was organized in 1976 by five Hispanic Congressmen: Herman Badillo (NY), Baltasar Corrada del Río (PR), Kika de la Garza (TX), Henry B. Gonzalez (TX) and Edward Roybal (CA)—and the Congressional Hispanic Conference include representatives of Spanish and Portuguese descent. The Hispanic Society of America is dedicated to the study of the arts and cultures of Spain, Portugal, and Latin America. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, which proclaims itself the champion of Hispanic success in higher education, has member institutions in the US, Puerto Rico, Latin America, Spain, and Portugal.\n\nIn a recent study, most Spanish speakers of Spanish or Latin American descent did not choose to use the terms \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" when describing their identity. Instead, they preferred to be identified by their country of origin. Over half of those surveyed said they had no preference for either term. When forced to choose, 33% chose \"Hispanic\" and 14% chose \"Latino.\"\n\nA study done in 2009 shows that there is not a significant difference between the attitudes or preferences towards the terms among young (18–25) and older individuals. The statistical numbers are almost identical. Among the overall Hispanic population, young Hispanic prefer to identify themselves with their family's country of origin. Both groups prefer the term \"American\" versus \"Latino/Hispanic\". Yet, older Hispanics are more likely to identify as white than younger Hispanics. When it comes to the preference of \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic\", the younger subgroup is more likely to state that it does not matter. If they do have a preference, both groups prefer the term \"Hispanic\" rather than \"Latino\".\n\nThe term Latin America was first coined by the French in the 19th century as \"Amérique latine\", during the time of the French Intervention in Mexico. It is a combination of the European word \"latino\" and the New World; \"America\". It was used to symbolically sever Mexico's Spanish roots, while at the same time, reinforcing a notion of belonging between the two nations. The \"Latin race\", as defined in this context, was composed of all people descending from nations who spoke romance tongues, descending from Latin. Hence, this definition would effectively include French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish peoples etc. as \"latinos\" along with the people descended from the Latin colonies. Juan Francisco Martinez wrote that \"France began talking about Amerique Latine during the rule of Napoleon III as a way of distinguishing between those areas of the Americas originally colonized by Europeans of Latin descent and those colonized by peoples front northern Europe. But the term was used to justify French intervention in the young republics of Latin America.\"\n\nThe adoption of the term \"Latino\" by the US Census Bureau in 2000 and its subsequent media attention brought about several controversies and disagreements, specifically in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries. Regarding it as an arbitrary, generic term, many Latin American scholars, journalists and organizations have objected to the mass media use of the word \"Latino\", pointing out that such ethnonyms are optional and should be used only to describe people involved in the practices, ideologies and identity politics of their supporters. They argue that if \"Hispanic\" is an imposed official term, then so is \"Latino\", since it was the French who coined the expression \"Latin America\" () to refer to the Spanish, French, and Portuguese-speaking countries of the Western Hemisphere, during their support of the Second Mexican Empire.\n\nSome authorities of American English maintain a distinction between the terms \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\":\n\nThough often used interchangeably in American English, Hispanic and Latino have slightly different ranges of meaning. Hispanic, from the Latin word for \"Spain,\" has the broader reference, potentially encompassing all Spanish-speaking peoples in both hemispheres and emphasizing the common denominator of language among communities that might sometimes seem to have little else in common. Latino—which in Spanish means \"Latin\" but in English is probably a shortening of the Spanish word \"latinoamericano\"—refers more exclusively to persons or communities of Latin American Spanish-speaking origin. Of the two, only Hispanic can be used in referring to Spain and its history and culture. In practice, however, this distinction is of little significance when referring to Spanish-speaking residents of the United States, most of whom are of Latin American origin and can thus theoretically be called by either word. · Since the 1980s Latino has come to be much more prevalent than Hispanic in national media, but actual Americans of Spanish-speaking Latin American heritage are far from unified in their preferences. For some, Latino is a term of ethnic pride, evoking the broad mix of Latin American peoples, while Hispanic, tied etymologically to Spain rather than the Americas, has distasteful associations with conquest and colonization. But in recent polls of Americans of Spanish-speaking Latin American ancestry, Hispanic is still preferred over Latino among those expressing a preference, while those having no preference constitute a majority overall.\nThe \"AP Stylebook\" also distinguishes between the terms. The \"Stylebook\" limits \"Hispanic\" to persons \"from—or whose ancestors were from—a Spanish-speaking land or culture. Latino and Latina are sometimes preferred\". It provides a more expansive definition, however, of \"Latino\". The \"Stylebook\" definition of \"Latino\" includes not only persons of Spanish-speaking land or ancestry, but also more generally includes persons \"from—or whose ancestors were from— ... Latin America.\" The \"Stylebook\" specifically lists Brazilians as an example of a group that can be considered Latino.\n\nIt is important to note the difference between Latino and Latina. Latino is traditionally reserved for males and Latina for females. A group of Latina women is termed \"Latinas\", whereas a group of Latino men or a combination of Latino and Latina individuals are designated as \"Latinos\" (See Latino (demonym)).\n\nThe term \"Latina\" is not used as much as the term \"Latino\", because in Spanish grammar the grammatical gender of the adjective \"Latino\" is masculine when it modifies either a group of males, a group of males and females, a group described by a grammatically masculine noun, or a group whose actual gender is not known. For this reason, the use of the grammatically masculine form is much more common.\n\nBoth Latino/a and Latin@ aim to challenge the gender binary that is inherent in the Spanish language, which combines the Spanish masculine ending \"o\" and the feminine \"a\".\n\nLatin@ has been noted to have the symbolical importance of suggesting inclusiveness, by having the \"o\" encircle the \"a\", in one character. Latin@ may be used to promote gender neutrality or be used to encompass both Latinos and Latinas without using the masculine \"Latinos\" designation for the mixed genders group.\n\nThe term Latinx was introduced in the early 2000s as a gender-neutral term for Latino/Latina, in addition to encompassing those who identify outside of the gender binary, such as those who are transgender, or those who are gender-fluid. The term has been embraced by the Latin LGBTQ+ communities.\n\nThe term \"Latinx\" reportedly surfaced with LGBTQ+ spaces on the internet in 2004, but use of the term didn't take off until a decade later.\n\nThe term has drawn criticisms for its invented roots, in addition to its perceived corruption of the Spanish language.\n\nThe U.S. government has defined \"Hispanic or Latino\" persons as being \"persons who trace their origin [to] ... Central and South America, and other Spanish cultures\". The Census Bureau's 2010 census provides a definition of the terms \"Latino\" and \"Hispanic\": \"Hispanic or Latino\" refers to a person of Mexican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race. It allows respondents to self-define whether they were Latino or Hispanic and then identify their specific country or place of origin. On its website, the Census Bureau defines \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" persons as being \"persons who trace their origin [to] ... Spanish-speaking Central and South America countries, and other Spanish cultures\".\n\nThese definitions thus arguably do not include Brazilian Americans, especially since the Census Bureau classifies Brazilian Americans as a separate ancestry group from \"Hispanic or Latino\". A surge of Portuguese-Americans faced a big scare when the Census Bureau revealed plans to categorize people of Portuguese descent as \"Hispanics\" in the 2020 National Census. The unified feelings of dispute were displayed in a national survey conducted by Palcus within the Portuguese-American community. The results were an overwhelming 90% of participants objecting to Portuguese-Americans being classified under the Hispanic ethnicity.\nFortunately for those opposed to the Portuguese-as-Hispanic classification, the Census Bureau later released an update stating that they never intended to classify people of Portuguese descent as Hispanic in the 2020 National Census. The 28 Hispanic or Latino American groups in the Census Bureau's reports are the following: \"Mexican,; Central American: Costa Rican, Guatemalan, Honduran, Nicaraguan, Panamanian, Salvadoran, Other Central American; South American: Bolivian, Chilean, Colombian, Ecuadorian, Paraguayan, Peruvian, Venezuelan, Other South American; Other Hispanic or Latino: Spaniard, Spanish, Spanish American, All other Hispanic\".\n\nIn the US, the terms are officially voluntary, self-designated classifications. However, the mass media has helped propagate them irrespective of this fact. The rapid spread of \"Latino\" in the US has been possible due to the policies of certain newspapers such as the \"Los Angeles Times\" and other California-based media during the 1990s. The use of the term as a label has been the target of journalists like Raoul Lowery who have attacked it, denouncing it as a misleading and simplistic way of tagging a group as diverse as Latin Americans:\n\nFor years I have campaigned against the \"Los Angeles Times\"-imposed word, \"Latino\", in describing the country's fastest growing ethnic \"Group,\" those with Spanish-surnames, those who speak Spanish, et al. The \"LA Times\" set its feet in concrete and the use of the word \"Latino\" and nothing has cracked the concrete since. Worst of all, other newspapers have followed the \"Times\" lead and news coverage, accuracy and the community have suffered.\nLowery argues that, according to the statistics of the Census Bureau, most middle-class people with Latin-American background living in the United States reject the term. He traces the polarization of the word to \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Frank del Olmo, who regarded the term \"Hispanic\" as \"ugly and imprecise\". He writes:\n\nThe third reason Del Olmo objected to the word \"Hispanic\" and championed the word \"Latino\" was that \"Chicano\" had been roundly rejected by all Mexican Americans but the most radical, blue collar, less educated, under-class people of Mexican-origin. Del Olmo pushed \"Latino\" as a substitute for the rejected \"Chicano.\" Unfortunately, he was in a position to push this substitution into the language of the \"Newspaper of Record\" in the West. Other papers and broadcast stations took up the word because it was the \"style\" of the \"LA Times\". Frank Del Olmo single-handedly branded millions of people.\nThe naming dispute is a phenomenon that has its roots mainly in California and other neighboring states. Before the adoption of the ethnonym \"Hispanic or Latino\" by the United States Government, the term Hispanic was commonly used for statistical purposes. However, many people did not feel satisfied with the term and started campaigns promoting the use of \"Latino\" as a new ethnonym. The Office of Management and Budget has stated that the new term should be, indeed, \"Hispanic or Latino\" because the usage of the terms differs—\"Hispanics is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States, whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion\".\n\nDespite this, debates regarding the proper name of the perceived homogeneous population of US citizens with Latin American or Spanish background still abound, and are even more acute. To find out how much people agree or disagree with either term, many polls have been conducted. According to a December 2000 poll by Hispanic Trends, 65% of the registered voters preferred the word \"Hispanic\", while 30% chose to identify themselves as \"Latino\". Daniel David Arreola, in his book \"Hispanic spaces, Latino places: community and cultural diversity in contemporary America\", points out that many Latin Americans feel more comfortable identifying themselves with their country of origin:\n\nWhat most of us know and what the results from the 1992 Latino National Political survey demonstrate is a preference for place of origin or national identity in what we call ourselves. Face-to-face interviews of 2,817 people were conducted in 1989 and 1990. Some 57 percent to 86 percent of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans—whether born in Mexico or born in the United States, whether born in the island or in the mainland—preferred to call themselves Mexican or Puerto Rican rather than panethnic names like Hispanic or Latino.\n\nA Pew Hispanic Center survey conducted November 9 – December 7, 2011, and published April 4, 2012, reported:\n\nNearly four decades after the United States government mandated the use of the terms \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" to categorize Americans who trace their roots to Spanish-speaking countries, a new nationwide survey of Hispanic adults finds that these terms still haven't been fully embraced by Hispanics themselves. A majority (51%) say they most often identify themselves by their family's country of origin; just 24% say they prefer a pan-ethnic label.\n\nOne of the major arguments of people who object to either term is not only the perceived stereotypical overtones they carry, but the unjust and unfair labeling of people who do not even belong to the practices and ideologies of such identities. This is true of many indigenous peoples such as the Wixarikas and the Lacandones, who still practice their own religious rituals without syncretism with Catholic elements. Journalist Juan Villegas writes:\n\nThe word 'Latino' may be loaded with negative connotations when used by non-Latinos in American culture because of its association with the sign 'Latin' which may imply a stereotyped character partially imposed by Hollywood. Latino is a sign that needs to be contextualized. It may bring some groups together, but it also may contribute to depoliticize a movement and to stereotype a diversity of social groups and cultures.\nThese characteristics that are often used, such as Hollywood, to classify a person of Latina/o culture and identity has been termed by scholars, \"As a system of media signification, Latinidad is a performative and performed dynamic set of popular signs associated with Latinas/os and Latina/o identity. Common signifiers of Latinidad are language, linguistic accents, religious symbols, tropical and spicy foods, and brown skin as a phenotypic identity.\" (Berg Ramirez p. 40–41). As Guzman discusses, \"signifiers most commonly associated with Latinidad produce a sense of authenticity within media texts\", (p. 235). Ramirez continues to discuss how these signifiers of Latinidad do not necessarily mean they are stereotypical. In actuality, Latina/os may utilize these \"signifiers\" for self-identifying purposes. In terms of media portrayal, Hollywood has invested a lot of time and money to develop a general notion of \"Latinidad\" because marketers, advertisers and media content producers have found that they are a very bankable demographic, thus turned \"Latinidad\" and Latina/o culture and identity to a commodity. What is problematic about this is when creating this general notion, the diversity within this demographic becomes suppressed and flattened in a demographic that is very heterogeneous just so marketers, advertisers and media content producers can communicate their version of \"authentic\" racial identity to consumers. Consequently, this opens the space for stereotypes to be created and perpetuated.\n\nOthers, such as Catherine Alexandra Carter and Rodolfo Acuña, address the issue from a more global and political perspective, stressing the importance of terms like \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic\" for the marketing industry and for statistical ends:\n\nThe terms 'Hispanic' and 'Latino', although first created for the purpose of lumping together a diverse group of people and making them more economically marketable, have grown into something far more significant. Over time the legitimacy and accuracy of these terms have come to influence not only the functioning of the marketing industry, but the organization and structure of many other aspects of life.\nWhen and why the Latino identity came about is a more involved story. Essentially, politicians, the media, and marketers find it convenient to deal with the different U.S. Spanish-speaking people under one umbrella. However, many people with Spanish surnames contest the term \"Latino\". They claim it is misleading because no Latino or Hispanic nationality exists since no Latino state exists, so generalizing the term \"Latino\" slights the various national identities included under the umbrella.\nDavila expands on the ramifications of the mass media's dominant use of \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic\" to categorize this demographic, \"... the extent to which assertions of cultural differences intersect with dominant norms of American citizenship that give preeminence to white, monolingual, middle-class producers of and contributors to a political body defined in national terms. My concern is ... with how notions of citizenship, belonging, and entitlement are directly intertwined and predicated on dominant U.S. nationalist categories. Such categories conflate race, culture, and language with nationality, establishing the hierarchies and coordinates against which cultural and linguistic differences are ultimately evaluated (Ong 1999; Williams 1989). It is therefore these hierarchies that frame the discourses of Latinidad channeled in the media, as well as the media's treatment of language and what it may potentially communicate to and about Latino's claim to belonging, and in what terms they may or may not be within the political community of the United States.\" Consequently, this may leave issues, concerns, and topics relevant to this demographic left unheard, discussed and addressed. They are left invisible, therefore not only conflating the cultural differences, but also marginalizing them for the sake of convenience and marketability to the mass media. However, this is not to say this is a monolithic issue. Instead, this further gives incentive for the demographic to create a space in which they can transform these notions where the representations are more diverse, complex and authentic.\n\nNot everyone rejects the terms and in fact feel that this idea of Latinidad is taken for granted. G. Christina Mora, author and UC Berkeley sociologist professor emphasizes the importance of the Hispanic term. In her book, \"Making Hispanics: How Activists, Bureaucrats, and Media Constructed a New American\" she explains the origins of the term and how it positively unites Hispanics. The term officially came into existence through United States government but it was due to an activist movement. Before this term, groups such as Mexicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans were only accounted for in census data as \"white\". The lack of specific data tied to Hispanics failed to show their social circumstance and therefore could not create necessary changes. There was no data to back up that they were significantly being affected by poverty, discrimination, and disadvantageous education. Without data, Hispanics would not receive adequate funding to change their circumstances and future. Due to the activism on behalf of Chicano and Puerto Rican individuals, there is data that supports and unites a group towards social equality.\n\nMora, states the following about the term and what she hopes it will mean for her daughter:\n\n\"I hope that my daughter will be conscious that the idea of Latino/Hispanic was actually rooted in an effort to work for social justice and political inclusion. Though we are a diverse community, many still grapple with disadvantage, discrimination and underrepresentation. All in all, I hope my daughter will embrace her Latinidad by being conscious of its roots in social justice and by continuing the cause of civil rights and political participation in America.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3494738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3494738", "title": "History of American newspapers", "text": "History of American newspapers\n\nThe history of American newspapers begins in the early 18th century with the publication of the first colonial newspapers. American newspapers began as modest affairs—a sideline for printers. They became a political force in the campaign for American independence. Following independence the first article of U.S. Constitution guaranteed freedom of the press. The U.S. Postal Service Act of 1792 provided substantial subsidies: Newspapers were delivered up to 100 miles for a penny and beyond for 1.5 cents, when first class postage ranged from six cents to a quarter.\n\nThe American press grew rapidly during the First Party System (1790s-1810s) when both parties sponsored papers to reach their loyal partisans. From the 1830s onward, the Penny press began to play a major role in American journalism. Technological advancements such as the telegraph and faster printing presses in the 1840s also helped to expand the press of the nation as it experienced rapid economic and demographic growth. Editors typically became the local party spokesman, and hard-hitting editorials were widely reprinted. \nBy 1900 major newspapers had become profitable powerhouses of advocacy, muckraking and sensationalism, along with serious, and objective news-gathering. During the early 20th century, prior to rise of television, the average American read several newspapers per-day. Starting in the 1920s changes in technology again morphed the nature of American journalism as radio and later, television, began to play increasingly important competitive roles.\n\nIn the late 20th century, much of American journalism became housed in big media chains. With the coming of digital journalism in the 21st century, all newspapers faced a business crisis as readers turned to the Internet for sources and advertisers followed them.\n\nMerchants published mainly commercial papers. For example, The Boston Daily Advertiser was reported on ship arrivals and departures.\n\nPrior to the 1830s, a majority of US newspapers were aligned with a political party or platform. Political parties would sponsor anonymous political figures in The Federal Republican and Daily Gazette. This was called partisan press and was not unbiased in opinion.\n\nThe first editors discovered readers loved it when they criticized the local governor; the governors discovered they could shut down the newspapers. The most dramatic confrontation came in New York in 1734, where the governor brought John Peter Zenger to trial for criminal libel after the publication of satirical attacks. The jury acquitted Zenger, who became the iconic American hero for freedom of the press. The result was an emerging tension between the media and the government. By the mid-1760s, there were 24 weekly newspapers in the 13 colonies (only New Jersey was lacking one), and the satirical attack on government became common practice in American newspapers.\n\nIt was James Franklin (1697–1735), Benjamin Franklin's older brother, who first made a news sheet something more than a garbled mass of stale items, \"taken from the \"Gazette\" and other Public Prints of London\" some six months late. Instead, he launched a third newspaper, \"The New England Courant\".\" His associates were known as the Hell-Fire Club; they succeeded in publishing a distinctive newspaper that annoyed the New England elite while proving entertaining and establishing a kind of literary precedent. Instead of filling the first part of the \"Courant\" with the tedious conventionalities of governors' addresses to provincial legislatures, James Franklin's club wrote essays and satirical letters modeled on \"The Spectator\", which first appeared in London ten years earlier. After the more formal introductory paper on some general topic, such as zeal or hypocrisy or honor or contentment, the facetious letters of imaginary correspondents commonly fill the remainder of the \"Courant\"'s first page. Timothy Turnstone addresses flippant jibes to Justice Nicholas Clodpate in the first extant number of the \"Courant\". Tom Pen-Shallow quickly follows, with his mischievous little postscript: \"Pray inform me whether in your Province Criminals have the Privilege of a Jury.\" Tom Tram writes from the moon about rumors of a certain \"villainous Postmaster\". (The \"Courant\" was always perilously close to legal difficulties and had, besides, a lasting feud with the town postmaster.) Ichabod Henroost complains of a gadding wife. Abigail Afterwit would like to know when the editor of the rival paper, the Gazette, \"intends to have done printing the Carolina Addresses to their Governor, and give his Readers Something in the Room of them, that will be more entertaining.\" Homespun Jack deplores the fashions in general and small waists in particular. Some of these papers represent native wit, with only a general approach to the model; others are little more than paraphrases of \"The Spectator\". And sometimes a \"Spectator\" paper is inserted bodily, with no attempt at paraphrase whatever. They also published poetry, histories, autobiographies, etc.\n\nBen Franklin, journalist\n[Benjamin Franklin] saw the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through the construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain, It was more than a business venture, for like many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty.\n\nWhen Franklin established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted three \"wretched little\" news sheets, Andrew Bradford's \"American Mercury\", and Samuel Keimer's \"Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences and Pennsylvania Gazette\". This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from Chambers's Universal Dictionary. Franklin quickly did away with all this when he took over the \"Instructor,\" and made it \"The Pennsylvania Gazette\". The \"Gazette\" soon became Franklin's characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun. From the first he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses. The series of essays called \"The Busy-Body,\" which he wrote for Bradford's \"American Mercury\" in 1729, followed the general Addisonian form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the ladies who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as Isaac Bickerstaff had been in the \"Tatler\". And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the \"sowre Philosopher\", is evidently a portrait of Franklin's rival, Samuel Keimer.\n\nAs time went on, Franklin depended less on his literary conventions, and more on his own native humor. In this there is a new spirit—not suggested to him by the fine breeding of Addison, or the bitter irony of Swift, or the stinging completeness of Pope. The brilliant little pieces Franklin wrote for his \"Pennsylvania Gazette\" have an imperishable place in American literature.\n\nThe \"Pennsylvania Gazette\", like most other newspapers of the period was often poorly printed. Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office, and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade. Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley of stale items that passed for news in the \"Gazette.\" His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal. On the other hand, his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature. Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution. Like many publishers, Franklin built up a book shop in his printing office; he took the opportunity to read new books before selling them.\n\nFranklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter-colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue. He began in Charleston, South Carolina in 1731. After the second editor died his widow Elizabeth Timothy took over and made it a success, 1738-46. She was one of colonial era's first woman printers. For three decades Franklin maintained a close business relationship with her and her son Peter who took over in 1746. The \"Gazette\" had a policy of impartiality in political debates, while creating the opportunity for public debate, which encouraged others to challenge authority. Editor Peter Timothy avoided blandness and crude bias, and after 1765 increasingly took a patriotic stand in the growing crisis with Great Britain.\n\nHowever, Franklin's \"Connecticut Gazette\" (1755–68) proved unsuccessful.\n\nEarly theatrical notices may also be followed in \"The Virginia Gazette\", a paper of unusual excellence, edited by William Parks in Williamsburg, the old capital of Virginia. Here \"The Busy-Body\", \"The Recruiting Officer\", and \"The Beaux' Stratagem\" were all performed, often by amateurs, though professionals were known as early as 1716 in Williamsburg. Life in Williamsburg in 1736 had a more cosmopolitan quality than in other towns. A sprightly essay-serial called The Monitor, which fills the first page of \"The Virginia Gazette\" for twenty-two numbers, probably reflects not only the social life of the capital, but also the newer fashion in such periodical work. It is dramatic in method, with vividly realized characters who gossip and chat over games of piquet or at the theatre. \"The Beaux' Stratagem\", which had been played in Williamsburg three weeks before, is mentioned as delightful enough to make one of the ladies commit the indiscretion of giggling. The Monitor represents a kind of light social satire unusual in the colonies.\n\nAfter 1750, general news became accessible, and the newspapers show more and more interest in public affairs. The literary first page was no longer necessary, though occasionally used to cover a dull period. A new type of vigorous polemic gradually superseded the older essay. A few of the well-known conventions were retained, however. We still find the fictitious letter, with the fanciful signature, or a series of papers under a common title, such as \"The Virginia-Centinel\", or Livingston's \"Watch-Tower\". The former is a flaming appeal to arms, running through \"The Virginia Gazette\" in 1756, and copied into Northern papers to rouse patriotism against the French enemy. The expression of the sentiment, even thus early, seems national. Livingston's well-known \"Watch-Tower\", a continuation of his pamphlet-magazine \"The Independent Reflecto\"r, has already the keen edge of the Revolutionary writings of fifteen and twenty years later. The fifty-second number even has one of the popular phrases of the Revolution: \"Had I not sounded the Alarm, Bigotry would e'er now have triumphed over the natural Rights of British Subjects.\" (Gaine's \"Mercury\" in 1754–1755)\n\nWeekly newspapers in major cities and towns were strongholds of patriotism (although there were a few Loyalist papers). They printed many pamphlets, announcements, patriotic letters and pronouncements. On the eve of Revolution Virginia had three separate weeklies at the same time named \"The Virginia Gazette\"—they all kept up a heavy fire against the king and his governors.\n\nIsaiah Thomas's \"Massachusetts Spy\", published in Boston and Worcester, was constantly on the verge of being suppressed, from the time of its establishment in 1770 to 1776 and during the American Revolution. In 1771-73 the \"Spy\" featured the essays of several anonymous political commentators who called themselves \"Centinel,\" \"Mucius Scaevola\" and \"Leonidas.\" They spoke in the same terms about similar issues, kept Patriot polemics on the front page, and supported each other against attacks in progovernment papers. Rhetorical combat was a Patriot tactic that explained the issues of the day and fostered cohesiveness without advocating outright rebellion. The columnists spoke to the colonists as an independent people tied to Britain only by voluntary legal compact. The \"Spy\" soon carried radicalism to its logical conclusion. When articles from the \"Spy\" were reprinted in other papers, as the country as a whole was ready for Tom Paine's \"Common Sense\" (in 1776).\n\nThe turbulent years between 1775 and 1783 were a time of great trial and disturbance among newspapers. Interruption, suppression, and lack of support checked their growth substantially. Although there were forty-three newspapers in the United States when the treaty of peace was signed (1783), as compared with thirty-seven on the date of the battle of Lexington (1775), only a dozen remained in continuous operation between the two events, and most of those had experienced delays and difficulties through lack of paper, type, and patronage. Not one newspaper in the principal cities, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, continued publication throughout the war. When the colonial forces were in possession, royalist papers were suppressed, and at times of British occupation Revolutionary papers moved away, or were discontinued, or they became royalist, only to suffer at the next turn of military fortunes. Thus there was an exodus of papers from the cities along the coast to smaller inland places, where alone it was possible for them to continue without interruption. Scarcity of paper was acute; type worn out could not be replaced. The appearance of the newspapers deteriorated, and issues sometimes failed to appear at all. Mail service, never good, was poorer than ever; foreign newspapers, an important source of information, could be obtained but rarely; many of the ablest writers who had filled the columns with dissertations upon colonial rights and government were now otherwise occupied.\n\nNews from a distance was less full and regular than before; yet when great events happened reports spread over the country with great rapidity, through messengers in the service of patriotic organizations. The quality of reporting was still imperfect. \"The Salem Gazette\" printed a full but colored account of the battle of Lexington, giving details of the burning, pillage, and barbarities charged to the British, and praising the militia who were filled with \"higher sentiments of humanity.\" The Declaration of Independence was published by Congress, 6 July 1776, in the \"Philadelphia Evening Post\", from which it was copied by most of the newspapers in the new nation; but some of them did not mention it until two weeks later, and even then found room for only a synopsis. When they were permitted to do so, they printed fairly full accounts of the proceedings of provincial assemblies and of Congress, which were copied widely, as were all official reports and proclamations. On the whole, however, a relatively small proportion of such material and an inadequate account of the progress of the war is found in the contemporaneous newspapers.\n\nThe general spirit of the time found fuller utterance in mottoes, editorials, letters, and poems. In the beginning both editorials and communications urged united resistance to oppression, praised patriotism, and denounced tyranny; as events and public sentiment developed these grew more vigorous, often a little more radical than the populace. Later, the idea of independence took form, and theories of government were discussed. More interesting and valuable as specimens of literature than these discussions were the poems inspired by the stirring events of the time. Long narratives of battles and of heroic deaths were mingled with eulogies of departed heroes. Songs meant to inspire and thrill were not lacking. Humor, pathos, and satire sought to stir the feelings of the public. Much of the poetry of the Revolution is to be found in the columns of the newspapers, from the vivid and popular satires and narratives of Philip Freneau to the saddest effusions of the most commonplace schoolmaster.\n\nThe newspapers of the Revolution were an effective force working towards the unification of sentiment, the awakening of a consciousness of a common purpose, interest, and destiny among the separate colonies, and of a determination to see the war through to a successful issue. They were more single-minded than the people themselves, and they bore no small share of the burden of arousing and supporting the often discouraged and indifferent public spirit. \"The New Jersey Journal\" became the second newspaper published in New Jersey. It was established by Shepard Kollock at his press during 1779 in the village of Chatham, New Jersey. This paper became a catalyst in the revolution. News of events came directly to the editor from Washington's headquarters in nearby Morristown, boosting the morale of the troops and their families, and he conducted lively debates about the efforts for independence with those who opposed and supported the cause he championed. Kollock later relocated the paper twice, until 1785, when he established his last publication location in Elizabeth under the same name. The \"Elizabeth Daily Journal\" ceased publication on January 2, 1992 after having been in continuous publication for 212 years, the fourth oldest newspaper published continuously in the United States.\n\nMany of the papers, however, which were kept alive or brought to life during the war could not adapt themselves to the new conditions of peace. Perhaps only a dozen of the survivors held their own in the new time, notably the \"Boston Gazette\", which declined rapidly in the following decade, The \"Connecticut Courant\" of Hartford, \"The Providence Gazette\", and \"The Pennsylvania Packet\" of Philadelphia, to which may be added such representative papers as the \"Massachusetts Spy\", Boston's \"Independent Chronicle\", the \"New York Journal and Packet\", the \"Newport Mercury\", the \"Maryland Gazette\" of Annapolis, the \"Pennsylvania Gazette\" and \"The Pennsylvania Journal\", both of Philadelphia. Practically all were of four small pages, each of three or four columns, issued weekly. In 1783, the \"Pennsylvania Evening Post\" became the first American daily. The next year, the \"Pennsylvania Packet\" was published three times a week, and the \"New York Journal\" twice a week, as were several of the papers begun in that year. There was a notable extension to new fields. In Vermont, where the first paper, established in 1781, had soon died, another arose in 1783; in Maine, two were started in 1785. In 1786, the first one west of the Alleghenies appeared at Pittsburgh, and following the westward tide of immigration the \"Kentucky Gazette\" was begun at Lexington in 1787.\n\nConditions were hardly more favorable to newspapers than during the recent conflict. The sources of news were much the same; the means of communication and the postal system were little improved. Newspapers were not carried in the mails but by favor of the postmen, and the money of one state was of dubious value in another. Consequently, circulations were small, rarely reaching a thousand; subscribers were slow in paying; and advertisements were not plentiful. Newspapers remained subject to provincial laws of libel, in accordance with the old common law, and were, as in Massachusetts for a short time in 1785, subject to special state taxes on paper or on advertisements. But public sentiment was growing strongly against all legal restrictions, and in general the papers practiced freedom, not to say license, of utterance.\n\nWith independence had come the consciousness of a great destiny. The collective spirit aroused by the war, though clouded by conflicting local difficulties, was intense, and the principal interest of the newspapers was to create a nation out of the loose confederation. Business and commerce were their next care; but in an effort to be all things to all men, the small page included a little of whatever might \"interest, instruct, or amuse.\" Political intelligence occupied first place; news, in the modern sense, was subordinated. A new idea, quite as much as a fire, a murder, or a prodigy, was a matter of news moment. There were always a few items of local interest, usually placed with paragraphs of editorial miscellany. Correspondents, in return for the paper, sent items; private letters, often no doubt written with a view to such use, were a fruitful source of news; but the chief resource was the newspapers that every office received as exchanges, carried in the post free of charge, and the newspapers from abroad.\n\nNewspapers became a form of public property after 1800. Americans believed that as republican citizens they had a right to the information contained in newspapers without paying anything. To gain access readers subverted the subscription system by refusing to pay, borrowing, or stealing. Editors, however, tolerated these tactics because they wanted longer subscription lists. First, the more people read the newspaper, more attractive it would be to advertisers, who would purchase more ads and pay higher rates. A second advantage was that greater depth of coverage translated into political influence for partisan newspapers. Newspapers also became part of the public sphere when they became freely available at reading rooms, barbershops, taverns, hotels and coffeehouses.\n\nThe editor, usually reflecting the sentiment of a group or a faction, began to emerge as a distinct power. He closely followed the drift of events and expressed vigorous opinions. But as yet the principal discussions were contributed not by the editors but by \"the master minds of the country.\" The growing importance of the newspaper was shown in the discussions preceding the Federal Convention, and notably in the countrywide debate on the adoption of the Constitution, in which the newspaper largely displaced the pamphlet. When Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay united to produce the Federalist Essays, they chose to publish them in \"The Independent Journal\" and \"The Daily Advertiser\", from which they were copied by practically every paper in America long before they were made into a book.\n\nWhen the first Congress assembled 4 March 1789, the administration felt the need of a paper, and, under the influence of Hamilton, John Fenno issued at New York, 15 April, the first number of \"The Gazette of the United States\", the earliest of a series of administration organs. The editorship of the \"Gazette\" later fell to Joseph Dennie, who had previously made a success of \"The Farmer's Weekly Museum\" and would later found \"Port Folio\", two of the most successful newspapers of the era. The seat of government became the journalistic center of the country, and as long as party politics remained the staple news interest the administration organs and their opponents were the chief sources of news for the papers of the country.\n\nPartisan bitterness increased during the last decade of the century as the First Party System took shape. The parties needed newspapers to communicate with their voters. New England papers were generally Federalist; in Pennsylvania there was a balance; in the West and South the Republican press predominated. Though the Federalists were vigorously supported by such able papers as Russell's \"Columbian Centinel\" in Boston, Isaiah Thomas's \"Massachusetts Spy\", \"The Connecticut Courant\", and, after 1793, Noah Webster's daily \"Minerva\" (soon renamed \"Commercial Advertiser\") in New York, the \"Gazette of the United States\", which in 1790 followed Congress and the capital to Philadelphia, was at the center of conflict, \"a paper of pure Toryism\", as Thomas Jefferson said, \"disseminating the doctrines of monarchy, aristocracy, and the exclusion of the people.\" To offset the influence of this, Jefferson and Madison induced Philip Freneau, who had been editing \"The Daily Advertiser\" in New York, to set up a \"half weekly\", to \"go through the states and furnish a Whig [Republican] vehicle of intelligence.\" Freneau's \"National Gazette\", which first appeared 31 October 1791, soon became the most outspoken critic of the administration of Adams, Hamilton, and Washington, and an ardent advocate of the French Revolution. Fenno and Freneau, in the \"Gazette of the United States\" and the \"National Gazette\", at once came to grips, and the campaign of personal and party abuse in partisan news reports, in virulent editorials, in poems and skits of every kind, was echoed from one end of the country to the other. The \"National Gazette\" closed in 1793 due to circulation problems and the political backlash against Jefferson and Madison's financial involvement in founding the paper.\n\nThe other Republican paper of primary importance was the \"Aurora General Advertiser\", founded by Ben Franklin's grandson and heir, Benjamin Franklin Bache, on October 2, 1790. The \"Aurora\", published from Franklin Court in Philadelphia, was the most strident newspaper of its time, attacking John Adams' anti-democratic policies on a daily basis. No paper is thought to have given Adams more trouble than the \"Aurora\". His wife, Abigail, wrote frequent letters to her sister and others decrying what she considered the slander spewing forth from the \"Aurora\". Jefferson credited the \"Aurora\" with averting a disastrous war with France, and laying the groundwork for his own election. Following Bache's death (the result of his staying in Philadelphia during a yellow fever epidemic, while he was awaiting trial under the Sedition Act), William Duane, an immigrant from Ireland, led the paper until 1822 (and married Bache's widow, following the death of his own wife in the same Yellow Fever epidemic). Like Freneau, Bache and Duane were involved in a daily back-and-forth with the Federalist editors, especially Fenno and Cobbett.\n\nNoah Webster, strapped for money, accepted an offer in late 1793 from Alexander Hamilton of $1,500 to move to New York City and edit a Federalist newspaper. In December he founded New York's first daily newspaper, \"American Minerva\" (later known as \"The Commercial Advertiser\"). He edited it for four years, writing the equivalent of 20 volumes of articles and editorials. He also published the semi-weekly publication, \"The Herald, A Gazette for the country\" (later known as \"The New York Spectator\"). As a partisan he soon was denounced by the Jeffersonian Republicans as \"a pusillanimous, half-begotten, self-dubbed patriot\", \"an incurable lunatic\", and \"a deceitful newsmonge ... Pedagogue and Quack.\" Fellow Federalist Cobbett labeled him \"a traitor to the cause of Federalism\", calling him \"a toad in the service of sans-culottism\", \"a prostitute wretch\", \"a great fool, and a barefaced liar\", \"a spiteful viper\", and \"a maniacal pedant.\" The master of words was distressed. Even the use of words like \"the people\", \"democracy\", and \"equality\" in public debate, bothered him for such words were \"metaphysical abstractions that either have no meaning, or at least none that mere mortals can comprehend.\"\n\nThe first party newspapers were full of vituperation. As one historian comments,\n\nIt was with the newspaper editors, however, on both sides that a climax of rancorous and venomous abuse was reached. Of the Federalist editors, the most voluminous masters of scurrility were William Cobbett of \"Porcupine's Gazette\" and John Ward Fenno of the \"United States Gazette\", at Philadelphia; Noah Webster of the \"American Minerva\", at New York; and at Boston, Benjamin Russell of the \"Columbian Centinel\", Thomas Paine of the \"Federal Orrery\", and John Russell of the \"Boston Gazette\". Chief of these was Cobbett, whose control of abusive epithet and invective may be judged from the following terms applied by him to his political foes, the Jacobins: \"refuse of nations\"; \"yelper of the Democratic kennels\"; \"vile old wretch\"; \"tool of a baboon\"; \"frog-eating, man-eating, blood-drinking cannibals\"; \"I say, beware, ye under-strapping cut-throats who walk in rags and sleep amidst filth and vermin; for if once the halter gets round your flea-bitten necks, howling and confessing will come too late.\" He wrote of the \"base and hellish calumnies\" propagated by the Jacobins, and of \"tearing the mask from the artful and ferocious villains who, owing to the infatuation of the poor, and the supineness of the rich, have made such fearful progress in the destruction of all that is amiable and good and sacred among men.\" Among the milder examples of his description of Jacobins was the following:\n\n\"Where the voice of the people has the most weight in public affairs, there it is most easy to introduce novel and subversive doctrines. In such States too, there generally, not to say always, exists a party who, from the long habit of hating those who administer the Government, become the enemies of the Government itself, and are ready to sell their treacherous services to the first bidder. To these descriptions of men, the sect of the Jacobins have attached themselves in every country they have been suffered to enter. They are a sort of flies, that naturally settle on the excremental and corrupted parts of the body politic ... The persons who composed this opposition, and who thence took the name of Anti-Federalists, were not equal to the Federalists, either in point of riches or respectability. They were in general, men of bad moral characters embarrassed in their private affairs, or the tools of such as were. Men of this caste naturally feared the operation of a Government imbued with sufficient strength to make itself respected, and with sufficient wisdom to exclude the ignorant and wicked from a share in its administration.\"\n\nThis decade of violence was nevertheless one of development in both the quality and the power of newspapers. News reporting was extended to new fields of local affairs, and the intense rivalry of all too numerous competitors awoke the beginnings of that rush for the earliest reports, which was to become the dominant trait in American journalism. The editor evolved into a new type. As a man of literary skill, or a politician, or a lawyer with a gift for polemical writing, he began to supersede the contributors of essays as the strongest writer on the paper. Much of the best writing, and of the rankest scurrility, be it said, was produced by editors born and trained abroad, like Bache of the \"Aurora\", Cobbett, Cooper, Gales, Cheetham, Callender, Lyon, and Holt. Of the whole number of papers in the country towards the end of the decade, more than one hundred and fifty, at least twenty opposed to the administration were conducted by aliens. The power wielded by these anti-administration editors impressed John Adams, who in 1801 wrote: \"If we had been blessed with common sense, we should not have been overthrown by Philip Freneau, Duane, Callender, Cooper, and Lyon, or their great patron and protector. A group of foreign liars encouraged by a few ambitious native gentlemen have discomfited the education, the talents, the virtues, and the prosperity of the country.\"\n\nThe most obvious example of that Federalist lack of common sense was the passage of the Alien and Sedition laws in 1798 to protect the government from the libels of editors. The result was a dozen convictions and a storm of outraged public opinion that threw the party from power and gave the Jeffersonian Republican press renewed confidence and the material benefit of patronage when the Republicans took control of the government in 1800. The Republican party was especially effective in building a network of newspapers in major cities to broadcast its statements and editorialize in its favor. Fisher Ames, a leading Federalist, blamed the newspapers for electing Jefferson: they were \"an overmatch for any Government ... The Jacobins owe their triumph to the unceasing use of this engine; not so much to skill in use of it as by repetition.\"\n\nThe newspapers continued primarily party organs; the tone remained strongly partisan, though it gradually gained poise and attained a degree of literary excellence and professional dignity. The typical newspaper, a weekly, had a paid circulation of 500. The growth of the postal system, with the free transportation of newspapers locally and statewide, allowed the emergence of powerful state newspapers that closely reflected, and shaped, party views.\n\nThe number and geographical distribution of newspapers grew apace. In 1800 there were between 150 and 200; by 1810 there were 366, and during the next two decades the increase was at least equally rapid. With astonishing promptness the press followed the sparse population as it trickled westward and down the Ohio or penetrated the more northerly forests. By 1835 papers had spread to the Mississippi River and beyond, from Texas to St. Louis, throughout Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and into Wisconsin. These pioneer papers, poorly written, poorly printed, and partisan often beyond all reason, served a greater than a merely local purpose in sending weekly to the seat of government their hundreds of messages of good and evil report, of politics and trade, of weather and crops, that helped immeasurably to bind the far-flung population into a nation. Every congressman wrote regularly to his own local paper; other correspondents were called upon for like service, and in some instances the country editors established extensive and reliable lines of intelligence; but most of them depended on the bundle of exchanges from Washington, Philadelphia, and New York, and reciprocally the city papers made good use of their country exchanges.\n\nMeanwhile, the daily newspapers were increasing in number. The first had appeared in Philadelphia and New York in 1784 and 1785; in 1796 one appeared in Boston. By 1810 there were twenty-seven in the country—one in the city of Washington, five in Maryland, seven in New York, nine in Pennsylvania, three in South Carolina, and two in Louisiana. As early as 1835 the \"Detroit Free Press\" began its long career.\n\nThe political and journalistic situation made the administration organ one of the characteristic features of the period. Fenno's Gazette had served the purpose for Washington and Adams; but the first great example of the type was the \"National Intelligencer\" established in October, 1800, by Samuel Harrison Smith, to support the administration of Jefferson and of successive presidents until after Jackson it was thrown into the opposition, and \"The United States Telegraph\", edited by Duff Green, became the official paper. It was replaced at the close of 1830 by a new paper, \"The Globe\", under the editorship of Francis P. Blair, one of the ablest of all ante-bellum political editors, who, with John P. Rives, conducted it until the changing standards and conditions in journalism rendered the administration organ obsolescent. The Globe was displaced in 1841 by another paper called \"The National Intelligencer\", which in turn gave way to \"The Madisonian\". Thomas Ritchie was in 1845 called from his long service on \"The Richmond Enquirer\" to found, on the remains of \"The Globe\", the \"Washington Union\", to speak for the Polk administration and to reconcile the factions of democracy. Neither the Union nor its successors, which maintained the semblance of official support until 1860, ever occupied the commanding position held by the \"Telegraph\" and \"The Globe\", but for forty years the administration organs had been the leaders when political journalism was dominant. Their influence was shared and increased by such political editors as M. M. Noah and James Watson Webb of the \"New York Courier and Enquirer\", Solomon Southwick of the \"Albany Register\", Edwin Croswell, who edited \"The Argus\" and who, supported by Martin Van Buren and others, formed what was known as the \"Albany Regency.\" The \"Regency\", the Richmond \"Junta\", which centered in the Enquirer, and the \"Kitchen Cabinet\" headed by the editor of \"The Globe\", formed one of the most powerful political and journalistic cabals that the country has ever known. Their decline, in the late thirties, was coincident with great changes, both political and journalistic, and though successors arose, their kind was not again so prominent or influential. The newspaper of national scope was passing away, yielding to the influence of the telegraph and the railroad, which robbed the Washington press of its claim to prestige as the chief source of political news. At the same time politics was losing its predominating importance. The public had many other interests, and by a new spirit and type of journalism was being trained to make greater and more various demands upon the journalistic resources of its papers.\n\nThe administration organ presents but one aspect of a tendency in which political newspapers generally gained in editorial individuality, and both the papers and their editors acquired greater personal and editorial influence. The beginnings of the era of personal journalism were to be found early in the 19th century. Even before Nathan Hale had shown the way to editorial responsibility, Thomas Ritchie, in the \"Richmond Enquirer\" in the second decade of the century, had combined with an effective development of the established use of anonymous letters on current questions a system of editorial discussion that soon extended his reputation and the influence of his newspaper far beyond the boundaries of Virginia. Washington Barrow and the \"Nashville Banner\", Amos Kendall and \"The Argus of Western America\", G. W. Kendall and the \"New Orleans Picayune\", John M. Francis and the \"Troy Times\", and Charles Hammond and the \"Cincinnati Gazette\", to mention but a few among many, illustrate the rise of editors to individual power and prominence in the third and later decades. Notable among these political editors was John Moncure Daniel, who just before 1850 became editor of the \"Richmond Examiner\" and soon made it the leading newspaper of the South. Perhaps no better example need be sought of brilliant invective and literary pungency in American journalism just prior to and during the Civil War than in Daniel's contributions to the \"Examiner\".\n\nThough it could still be said that \"too many of our gazettes are in the hands of persons destitute at once of the urbanity of gentlemen, the information of scholars, and the principles of virtue\", a fact due largely to the intensity of party spirit, the profession was by no means without editors who exhibited all these qualities, and put them into American journalism. William Coleman, for instance, who, encouraged by Alexander Hamilton, founded the \"New York Evening Post\" in 1801, was a man of high purposes, good training, and noble ideals. The \"Evening Post\", reflecting variously the fine qualities of the editor, exemplified the improvement in tone and illustrated the growing importance of editorial writing, as did a dozen or more papers in the early decades of the century. Indeed, the problem most seriously discussed at the earliest state meetings of editors and publishers, held in the thirties, was that of improving the tone of the press. They tried to attain by joint resolution a degree of editorial self-restraint, which few individual editors had as yet acquired. Under the influence of Thomas Ritchie, vigorous and unsparing political editor but always a gentleman, who presided at the first meeting of Virginia journalists, the newspaper men in one state after another resolved to \"abandon the infamous practice of pampering the vilest of appetites by violating the sanctity of private life, and indulging in gross personalities and indecorous language\", and to \"conduct all controversies between themselves with decency, decorum, and moderation.\" Ritchie found in the low tone of the newspapers a reason why journalism in America did not occupy as high a place in public regard as it did in England and France.\n\nThe editorial page was assuming something of its modern form. The editorial signed with a pseudonym gradually died, but unsigned editorial comment and leading articles did not become an established feature until after 1814, when Nathan Hale made them a characteristic of the newly established \"Boston Daily Advertiser\". From that time on they grew in importance until in the succeeding period of personal journalism they were the most vital part of the greater papers.\n\nIn the 1830s new high speed presses allowed the cheap printing of tens of thousands of papers a day. The problem was to sell them to a mass audience, which required new business techniques (such as rapid citywide delivery) and a new style of journalism that would attract new audiences. Politics, scandal, and sensationalism worked.\n\nJames Gordon Bennett Sr. (1794–1872) took the lead in New York. In a decade of unsuccessful effort as a political journalist he had become familiar with the increasing enterprise in news-gathering. He despised the upscale journalism of the day—the seriousness of tone, the phlegmatic dignity, the party affiliations, the sense of responsibility. He believed journalists were fools to think that they could best serve their own purposes by serving the politicians. As Washington correspondent for the \"New York Enquirer\", he wrote vivacious, gossipy prattle, full of insignificant and entertaining detail, to which he added keen characterization and deft allusions. Bennett saw a public who would not buy a serious paper at any price, who had a vast and indiscriminate curiosity better satisfied with gossip than discussion, with sensation rather than fact, who could be reached through their appetites and passions. The idea that he did much to develop rested on the success of the one-cent press created by the establishment of the \"New York Sun\" in 1833. To pay at such a price these papers must have large circulations, sought among the public that had not been accustomed to buy papers, and gained by printing news of the street, shop, and factory. To reach this public Bennett began the \"New York Herald\", a small paper, fresh, sprightly, terse, and \"newsy\". \"In journalistic débuts of this kind\", Bennett wrote, \"many talk of principle—political principle, party principle—as a sort of steel trap to catch the public. We ... disdain ... all principle, as it is called, all party, all politics. Our only guide shall be good, sound, practical common sense, applicable to the business and bosoms of men engaged in every-day life.\"\n\nNews was but a commodity, the furnishing of which was a business transaction only, which ignored the social responsibility of the press, \"the grave importance of our vocation\", prized of the elder journalists and of the still powerful six-cent papers. \"The Herald,\" like the \"Sun,\" was at once successful, and was remarkably influential in altering journalistic practices. The penny press expanded its coverage into \"personals\"—short paid paragraphs by men and women looking for companionship. They revealed people's intimate relationships to a public audience and allowed city folk to connect with and understand their neighbors in an increasingly anonymous metropolis. They included heavy doses of imagination and fiction, typically romantic, highly stylized. Sometimes the same person updated the paragraph regularly, making it like a serial short short story. Moralists were aghast, and warned of the ruin of young girls. (Commenting on censorship of books in the 1920s, New York Mayor Jimmy Walker said he had seen many girls ruined, but never by reading.) More worrisome to the elders they reflected a loss of community control over the city's youth, suggesting to Protestant leaders the need for agencies like the YMCA to provide wholesome companionship. Personals are still included in many papers and magazines into the 21st century.\n\nIn a period of widespread unrest and change many specialized forms of journalism sprang up—religious, educational, agricultural, and commercial, which there is no space here to discuss. Workingmen were questioning the justice of existing economic systems and raising a new labour problem; the socialistic ideas of Cabet and Fourier were spreading; Unitarianism and Transcendentalism were creating and expressing new spiritual values; temperance, prohibition, and the political status of women were being discussed; abolition was a general irritant and a nightmare to politicians. The subject of controversy most critically related to journalism was abolition. The , which began with \"The Emancipator\" of 1820, and had its chief representative in William Lloyd Garrison's \"Liberator\", first issued 1 January 1831, forced the slavery question upon the newspapers, and there ensued a struggle for the freedom of the press more acute than any since that caused by the Alien and Sedition laws. Many abolitionist papers were excluded from the mails; their circulation was forcibly prevented in the South; in Boston, New York, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Alton, and elsewhere, editors were assaulted, offices were attacked and destroyed; rewards were offered in the South for the capture of Greeley and Garrison; in a few instances editors, like Lovejoy at Alton, lost their lives at the hands of mobs.\n\nNearly every county seat, and most towns of more than 500 or 1000 population sponsored one or more weekly newspapers. Politics was of major interest, with the editor-owner typically deeply involved in local party organizations. However, the paper also contained local news, and presented literary columns and book excerpts that catered to an emerging middle class literate audience. A typical rural newspaper provided its readers with a substantial source of national and international news and political commentary, typically reprinted from metropolitan newspapers. Comparison of a subscriber list for 1849 with data from the 1850 census indicates a readership dominated by property owners but reflecting a cross-section of the population, with personal accounts suggesting the newspaper also reached a wider non-subscribing audience. In addition, the major metropolitan daily newspapers often prepared weekly editions for circulation to the countryside. Most famously the \"Weekly New York Tribune\" was jammed with political, economic and cultural news and features, and was a major resource for the Whig and Republican parties, as well as a window on the international world, and the New York and European cultural scenes.\n\nThe first newspaper to be published west of the Mississippi was the Missouri Gazette. Its starting issue was published on July 12, 1808 by Joseph Charless an Irish printer. Swayed by Meriweather Lewis to leave his home in Kentucky and start a new paper for the Missouri Territory Charles was identified by the paper's masthead as \"Printer to the Territory\". The paper published advertisements for domestic help, notice for runaway slaves, public notices, and sales for merchandise like land plots or cattle. Newspapers like the Gazette were instrumental in the founding new territories and supporting their stability as they become states.\n\nWith westward expansion other territories, like Nebraska, followed in Lewis and Missouri's plan for territory stability and founded a newspaper alongside the opening of the Nebraska Territory in 1854. The Nebraska Palladium was a rough newspaper that produced poetry and news from the East, ran advertisements, and created a space for emerging political editorials. that developed a sense of community and cultural influence in the territory. Produced during a time when pioneers were far removed from neighbors these early territorial papers brought a sense of community to the territories. Because of the information gap felt by new settlers of the territories such as Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, and Oklahoma there was a mass startup numerous newspapers. It has been stated on the period that Wherever a town sprang up ... a printer with a rude press and a 'shirt-tail-full of type' was sure to appear\". Competition was intense between the large number of pop-up papers and often the newspapers would fail within a year or condense themselves with other publications.\n\nThis idea of news and the newspaper for its own sake, the unprecedented aggressiveness in news-gathering, and the blatant methods by which the cheap papers were popularized aroused the antagonism of the older papers, but created a competition that could not be ignored. Systems of more rapid news-gathering (such as by \"pony express\") and distribution quickly appeared. Sporadic attempts at co-operation in obtaining news had already been made; in 1848 the \"Journal of Commerce\", \"Courier and Enquirer\", \"Tribune\", \"Herald\", \"Sun\", and \"Express\" formed the New York Associated Press to obtain news for the members jointly. Out of this idea grew other local, then state, and finally national associations. European news, which, thanks to steamship service, could now be obtained when but half as old as before, became an important feature. In the forties several papers sent correspondents abroad, and in the next decade this field was highly developed.\n\nThe telegraph, invented in 1844, quickly linked all major cities and most minor ones to a national network that provided news in a matter of minutes or hours rather than days or weeks. It transformed the news gathering business. Telegraphic columns became a leading feature. The Associated Press (AP) became the dominant factor in the distribution of news. The inland papers, in such cities as Chicago, Louisville, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and New Orleans, used AP dispatches to become became independent of papers in Washington and New York. In general, only one newspaper in each city had the Associated Press franchise, and it dominated the market for national and international news. United Press was formed in the 1880s to challenge the monopoly. The growing number of chains each set up their own internal dissemination system.\n\nOut of the period of restless change in the 1830s there emerged a few great editors whose force and ability gave them and their newspapers an influence hitherto unequalled, and made the period between 1840 and 1860 that of personal journalism. These few men not only interpreted and reflected the spirit of the time, but were of great influence in shaping and directing public opinion. Consequently, the scope, character, and influence of newspapers was in the period immensely widened and enriched, and rendered relatively free from the worst subjection to political control.\n\nNaturally, the outstanding feature of this personal journalism was the editorial. Rescued from the slough of ponderousness into which it had fallen in its abject and uninspired party service, the editorial was revived, invigorated, and endowed with a vitality that made it the center about which all other features of the newspaper were grouped. It was individual; however large the staff of writers, the editorials were regarded as the utterance of the editor. \"Greeley says\" was the customary preface to quotations from the Tribune, and indeed many editorials were signed. James Gordon Bennett, Sr., Samuel Bowles (1826–78), Horace Greeley (1811–72), and Henry J. Raymond (1820–69) who were the outstanding figures of the period. Of Bennett's influence something has already been said; especially, he freed his paper from party control. His power was great, but it came from his genius in gathering and presenting news rather than from editorial discussion, for he had no great moral, social or political ideals, and his influence, always lawless and uncertain, can hardly be regarded as characteristic of the period. Of the others named, and many besides, it could be said with approximate truth that their ideal was \"a full presentation and a liberal discussion of all questions of public concernment, from an entirely independent position, and a faithful and impartial exhibition of all movements of interest at home and abroad.\" As all three were not only upright and independent, but in various measure gifted with the quality of statesmanship at once philosophical and practical, their newspapers were powerful molders of opinion at a critical period in the history of the nation.\n\nThe news field was immeasurably broadened; news style was improved; interviews, newly introduced, lent the ease and freshness of dialogue and direct quotation. There was a notable improvement in the reporting of business, markets, and finance. In a few papers the literary department was conducted by staffs as able as any today. A foreign news service was developed that in intelligence, fidelity, and general excellence reached the highest standard yet attained in American journalism. A favorite feature was the series of letters from the editor or other member of the staff who traveled and wrote of what he heard or saw. Bowles, Olmsted, Greeley, Bayard Taylor, Bennett, and many others thus observed life and conditions at home or abroad; and they wrote so entertainingly and to such purpose that the letters—those of Olmsted and Taylor, for instance—are still sources of entertainment or information.\n\nThe growth of these papers meant the development of great staffs of workers that exceeded in numbers anything dreamed of in the preceding period. Although later journalism has far exceeded in this respect the time we are now considering, still the scope, complexity, and excellence of our modern metropolitan journalism in all its aspects were clearly begun between 1840 and 1860.\n\nThe \"New York Tribune\" under Horace Greeley exhibited the best features of the new and semi-independent personal journalism based upon political party supporters and inspired with an enthusiasm for service that is one of the fine characteristics of the period. In editing the \"New Yorker\" Greeley had acquired experience in literary journalism and in political news; his \"Jeffersonian\" and \"Log Cabin,\" were popular Whig campaign papers, had brought him into contact with politicians and made his reputation as an insightful, vigorous journalist. He was a staunch party man, therefore he was chosen to manage a party organ when one was needed to support the Whig administration of Harrison. The prospectus of the \"New York Tribune\" appeared 3 April 1841. Greeley's ambition was to make the \"Tribune\" not only a good party paper, but also the first paper in America, and he succeeded by imparting to it a certain idealistic character with a practical appeal that no other journal possessed. His sound judgment appeared in the unusually able staff that he gathered about him. Almost from the first, the staff that made the Tribune represented a broad catholicity of interests and tastes, in the world of thought as well as in the world of action, and a solid excellence in ability and in organization, which were largely the result of the genius of Greeley and over which he was the master spirit. It included Henry J. Raymond, who later became Greeley's rival on the \"Times\", George M. Snow, George William Curtis, Charles A. Dana, Bayard Taylor, George Ripley, William H. Fry, Margaret Fuller, Edmund Quincy, and Charles T. Congdon. It is easy to understand how with such a group of writers the idea of the literary newspaper, which had been alive from the beginning of the century, should have advanced well-night to its greatest perfection.\n\nThe great popular strength of the \"Tribune\" doubtless lay in its disinterested sympathy with all the ideals and sentiments that stirred the popular mind in the forties and fifties. \"We cannot afford\", Greeley wrote, \"to reject unexamined any idea which proposes to improve the moral, intellectual, or social condition of mankind.\" He pointed out that the proper course of an editor, in contrast to that of the time-server, was to have \"an ear open to the plaints of the wronged and suffering, though they can never repay advocacy, and those who mainly support newspapers will be annoyed and often exposed by it; a heart as sensitive to oppression and degradation in the next street as if they were practiced in Brazil or Japan; a pen as ready to expose and reprove the crimes whereby wealth is amassed and luxury enjoyed in our own country as if they had only been committed by Turks or Pagans in Asia some centuries ago.\" In conformity with these principles Greeley lent his support to all proposals for ameliorating the condition of the labouring men by industrial education, by improved methods of farming, or even by such radical means as the socialistic Fourier Association. He strongly advocated the protective tariff because he believed that it was for the advantage of the workingman; and the same sympathy led him to give serious attention to the discussion of women's rights with special reference to the equal economic status of women. There were besides many lesser causes in which the Tribune displayed its spirit of liberalism, such as temperance reform, capital punishment, the Irish repeals, and the liberation of Hungary.\n\nOn the most important question of the time, the abolition of slavery, Greeley's views were intimately connected with party policy. His antipathy to slavery, based on moral and economic grounds, placed him from the first among the mildly radical reformers. But his views underwent gradual intensification. Acknowledged the most influential Whig party editor in 1844, he had by 1850 become the most influential anti-slavery editor—the spokesman not of Whigs merely but of a great class of Northerners who were thoroughly antagonistic to slavery but who had not been satisfied with either the non-political war of Garrison or the one-plank political efforts of the Free Soil party. This influence was greatly increased between 1850 and 1854 by some of the most vigorous and trenchant editorial writing America has ever known. The circulation of the Tribune in 1850 was, all told, a little less than sixty thousand, two-thirds of which was the Weekly. In 1854 the Weekly alone had a circulation of 112,000 copies. But even this figure is not the measure of the \"Tribune\"'s peculiar influence, \"for it was pre-eminently the journal of the rural districts, and one copy did service for many readers. To the people in the Adirondack wilderness it was a political bible, and the well-known scarcity of Democrats there was attributed to it. Yet it was as freely read by the intelligent people living on the Western Reserve of Ohio\", (James Ford Rhodes) and in Wisconsin and Illinois. The work of Greeley and his associates in these years gave a new strength and a new scope and outlook to American journalism.\n\nGreeley was a vigorous advocate of freedom of the press, especially in the 1830s and 1840s. He fought numerous libel lawsuits waged battles with the New York City postmaster, and shrugged off threats of duels and physical violence to his body. Greeley used his hard-hitting editorials to alert the public to dangers to press freedom. He would not tolerate any threats to freedom and democracy which curtailed the ability of the press to serve as a watchdog against corruption and a positive agency of social reform.\n\nAfter replacing Greeley Whitelaw Reid became the powerful long-time editor of the \"Tribune.\" He emphasized the importance of partisan newspapers in 1879:\n\nHenry Jarvis Raymond, who began his journalistic career on the \"Tribune\" and gained further experience in editing the respectable, old-fashioned, political \"Courier and Enquirer\", perceived that there was an opening for a type of newspaper that should stand midway between Greeley, the moralist and reformer, and Bennett, the cynical, non-moral news-monger. He was able to interest friends in raising the hundred thousand dollars that he thought essential to the success of his enterprise. This sum is significant of the development of American daily journalism, for Greeley had started the \"Tribune\" only ten years earlier with a capital of one thousand dollars, and Bennett had founded the \"Herald\" with nothing at all. On this sound financial basis, Raymond began the career of the \"New York Times\" with his business partner George Jones on September 18, 1851, and made it a success from the outset. He perfected his news-gathering forces and brought into play his intimate acquaintance with men of affairs to open up the sources of information. Above all he set a new standard for foreign service. The American public never had a more general and intelligent interest in European affairs than in the middle years of the 19th century. The leading papers directed their best efforts toward sustaining and improving their foreign service, and Raymond used a brief vacation in Europe to establish for his paper a system of correspondence as trustworthy, if not as inclusive, as that of the \"Herald\" or \"Tribune\". If our newspapers today are immeasurably in advance of those of sixty years ago in almost every field of journalism, there is only here and there anything to compare in worth with the foreign correspondence of that time. The men who wrote from the news centers of Europe were persons of wide political knowledge and experience, and social consequence. They had time and ability to do their work thoroughly, carefully, and intelligently, innocent of superficial effort toward sensation, of the practices of inaccurate brevity and irresponsible haste, which began with the laying of the Atlantic cable.\nThe theory of journalism announced by Raymond in the \"Times\" marks another advance over the party principles of his predecessors. He thought that a newspaper might assume the rôle now of a party paper, now of an organ of non-partisan, independent thought, and still be regarded by the great body of its readers as steadily guided by principles of sincere public policy. An active ambition for political preferment prevented him from achieving this ideal. Although he professed conservatism only in those cases where conservatism was essential to the public good and radicalism in everything that might require radical treatment and radical reform, the spirit of opposition to the \"Tribune\", as well as his temperamental leanings, carried him definitely to the conservative side. He was by nature inclined to accept the established order and make the best of it. Change, if it came, should come not through radical agitation and revolution, but by cautious and gradual evolution. The world needed brushing, not harrowing. Such ideas, as he applied them to journalism, appealed to moderate men, reflected the opinions of a large and influential class somewhere between the advanced thinkers and theorists and the mass of men more likely to be swayed by passions of approbation or protest than by reason.\nIt was the tone of the \"Times\" that especially distinguished it from its contemporaries. In his first issue Raymond announced his purpose to write in temperate and measured language and to get into a passion as rarely as possible. \"There are few things in this world which it is worth while to get angry about; and they are just the things anger will not improve.\" In controversy he meant to avoid abusive language. His style was gentle, candid, and decisive, and achieved its purpose by facility, clearness, and moderation rather than by powerful fervor and invective. His editorials were generally cautious, impersonal, and finished in form. With abundant self-respect and courtesy, he avoided, as one of his coadjutors said, vulgar abuse of individuals, unjust criticism, or narrow and personal ideas. He had that degree and kind of intelligence that enabled him to appreciate two principles of modern journalism—the application of social ethics to editorial conduct and the maintenance of a comprehensive spirit. As he used them, these were positive, not negative virtues.\nRaymond's contribution to journalism, then, was not the introduction of revolutionizing innovations in any department of the profession but a general improving and refining of its tone, a balancing of its parts, sensitizing it to discreet and cultivated popular taste. Taking \"The Times of London\" as his model, he tried to combine in his paper the English standard of trustworthiness, stability, inclusiveness, and exclusiveness, with the energy and news initiative of the best American journalism; to preserve in it an integrity of motive and a decorum of conduct such as he possessed as a gentleman.\n\nNewspapers continued to play a major political role. In rural areas, the weekly newspaper published in the county seat played a major role. In the larger cities, different factions of the party have their own papers. During the Reconstruction era (1865-1877), leading editors increasingly turned against corruption represented by President Grant and his Republican Party. They strongly supported the third-party Liberal Republican movement of 1872, which nominated Horace Greeley for president. The Democratic Party endorsed Greeley officially, but many Democrats could not accept the idea of voting for the man who had been their fiercest enemy for decades; he lost in a landslide. Most of the 430 Republican newspapers in the Reconstruction South were edited by scalawags (Southern born white men) – only 20 percent were edited by carpetbaggers (recent arrivals from the North who formed the opposing faction in the Republican Party. White businessmen generally boycotted Republican papers, which survived through government patronage.\n\nNewspapers were a major growth industry in the late nineteenth century. The number of daily papers grew from 971 to 2226, 1880 to 1900. Weekly newspapers were published in smaller towns, especially county seats, or for German, Swedish and other immigrant subscribers. They grew from 9,000 to 14,000, and by 1900 the United States published more than half of the newspapers in the world, with two copies per capita. Out on the frontier, the first need for a boom town was a newspaper. The new states of North and South Dakota by 1900 had 25 daily papers, and 315 weeklies. Oklahoma was still not a state, but it could boast of nine dailies and nearly a hundred weeklies. In the largest cities the newspapers competed fiercely, for newsboys sold each copy and they did not rely on subscriptions. Financially, the major papers depended on advertising, which paid in proportion to the circulation base. By the 1890s in New York City, especially during the Spanish–American War, circulations reached 1 million a day for Pulitzer's \"World\" and Hearst's \"Journal.\" While smaller papers relied on loyal Republican or Democratic readers who appreciated the intense partisanship of the editorials, the big-city papers realized they would lose half their potential audience by excessive partisanship, so they took a more ambiguous position, except at election time.\n\nAfter the Civil War, there were several transitions in the newspaper industry. Many of the main founders of the modern press died, including Greeley, Raymond, Bennett, Bowles. and Bryant. Their successors continued the basic policies and approaches, but were less innovative. The civil war put a premium on news reporting, rather than editorials, and the news columns became increasingly important, with speed of the essence as multiple newspapers competed on the city streets for customers. The major papers issued numerous editions the day each with blaring headlines to capture attention. Reporting became more prestigious. There was no newspaper that exerted the national influence of Greeley's \"New York Tribune.\" Western cities, developed influential newspapers of their own in Chicago, San Francisco and St. Louis; the Southern press went into eclipse as the region lost its political influence and talented young journalists headed North for their careers. The Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient, producing a vast quantity of reasonably accurate, factual reporting on state and national events that editors used to service the escalating demand for news. Circulation growth was facilitated by new technology, such as the stereotype, by which 10 or more high-speed presses could print the same pages.\n\nWith the movement of thousands of people with the conclusion of the Civil War new territories and states experienced and influx of settlers. The growth of a state and territory could be measured by the growth of the areas newspapers. With settlers pushing westward communities were considered stable if they had a newspaper publishing. This was a form of communication for all of the settlers and pioneers that lived in the far, rural communities. Larger, more established towns would begin to grow multiple newspapers. One of the papers would promote a Democratic view and the other Republican.\n\nA muckraker is an American English term for a person who investigates and exposes issues of corruption. There were widely held values, such as political corruption, corporate crime, child labor, conditions in slums and prisons, unsanitary conditions in food processing plants (such as meat), fraudulent claims by manufacturers of patent medicines, labor racketeering, and similar topics. In British English however the term is applied to sensationalist scandal-mongering journalist, not driven by any social [original text missing; \"journalist\" above likely should be \"journalism\" or \"a ... journalist.\"].\n\nThe term muckraker is most usually associated in America with a group of American investigative reporters, novelists and critics in the Progressive Era from the 1890s to the 1920s. It also applies to post 1960 journalists who follow in the tradition of those from that period. See History of American newspapers for Muckrakers in the daily press.\n\nMuckrakers have most often sought, in the past, to serve the public interest by uncovering crime, corruption, waste, fraud and abuse in both the public and private sectors. In the early 1900s, muckrakers shed light on such issues by writing books and articles for popular magazines and newspapers such as \"Cosmopolitan\", \"The Independent\", \"Collier's Weekly\" and \"McClure's\". Some of the most famous of the early muckrakers are Ida Tarbell, Lincoln Steffens, and Ray Stannard Baker.\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt coined the term 'muckraker' in a 1906 speech when he likened the muckrakers to the Man with the Muckrake, a character in John Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress\" (1678).\n\nRoosevelt disliked their relentless negativism. as he attacked them for stretching the truth:\n\nThere are, in the body politic, economic and social, many and grave evils, and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them. There should be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil man whether politician or business man, every evil practice, whether in politics, in business, or in social life. I hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker, every man who, on the platform, or in book, magazine, or newspaper, with merciless severity makes such attack, provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful.\n\n\n\nYellow journalism is a pejorative reference to journalism that features scandal-mongering, sensationalism, jingoism or other unethical or unprofessional practices by news media organizations or individual journalists.\n\nThe term originated during the circulation battles between Joseph Pulitzer's \"New York World\" and William Randolph Hearst's \"New York Journal\" from 1895 to about 1898, and can refer specifically to this period. Both papers were accused by critics of sensationalizing the news in order to drive up circulation, although the newspapers did serious reporting as well. The \"New York Press\" coined the term \"Yellow Journalism\" in early 1897 to describe the papers of Pulitzer and Hearst.\n\nJoseph Pulitzer purchased the \"World\" in 1882 after making the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" the dominant daily in that city. The publisher had gotten his start editing a German-language publication in St. Louis, and saw a great untapped market in the nation's immigrant classes. Pulitzer strove to make \"The World\" an entertaining read, and filled his paper with pictures, games and contests that drew in readers, particularly those who used English as a second language. Crime stories filled many of the pages, with headlines like \"Was He A Suicide?\" and \"Screaming for Mercy\". Pulitzer provided a bargain: he only charged two cents per issue but gave readers eight and sometimes 12 pages of information (the only other two-cent paper in the city never exceeded four pages).\n\nWhile there were many sensational stories in the \"World\", they were by no means the only pieces, or even the dominant ones. Pulitzer believed that newspapers were public institutions with a duty to improve society, and he put the \"World\" in the service of social reform. During a heat wave in 1883, \"World\" reporters went into the Manhattan's tenements, writing stories about the appalling living conditions of immigrants and the toll the heat took on the children. Stories headlined \"How Babies Are Baked\" and \"Lines of Little Hearses\" spurred reform and drove up circulation.\n\nJust two years after Pulitzer took it over, the \"World\" became the highest circulation newspaper in New York, aided in part by its strong ties to the Democratic Party. Older publishers, envious of Pulitzer's success, began criticizing the \"World\", harping on its crime stories and stunts while ignoring its more serious reporting—trends that influenced the popular perception of yellow journalism, both then and now. Charles Dana, editor of the \"New York Sun\", attacked the \"World\" and said Pulitzer was \"deficient in judgment and in staying power.\"\n\nPulitzer's approach made an impression on William Randolph Hearst, a mining heir who acquired the \"San Francisco Examiner\" from his father in 1887. Hearst read the \"World\" while studying at Harvard University and resolved to make the \"Examiner\" as bright as Pulitzer's paper. Under his leadership, the \"Examiner\" devoted 24 percent of its space to crime, presenting the stories as morality plays, and sprinkled adultery and \"nudity\" (by 19th century standards) on the front page.\n\nA month after taking over the paper, the \"Examiner\" ran this headline about a hotel fire:\n\nHUNGRY, FRANTIC FLAMES. They Leap Madly Upon the Splendid Pleasure Palace by the Bay of Monterey, Encircling Del Monte in Their Ravenous Embrace From Pinnacle to Foundation. Leaping Higher, Higher, Higher, With Desperate Desire. Running Madly Riotous Through Cornice, Archway and Facade. Rushing in Upon the Trembling Guests with Savage Fury. Appalled and Panic-Striken the Breathless Fugitives Gaze Upon the Scene of Terror. The Magnificent Hotel and Its Rich Adornments Now a Smoldering heap of Ashes. The \"Examiner\" Sends a Special Train to Monterey to Gather Full Details of the Terrible Disaster. Arrival of the Unfortunate Victims on the Morning's Train—A History of Hotel del Monte—The Plans for Rebuilding the Celebrated Hostelry—Particulars and Supposed Origin of the Fire.\n\nHearst could go overboard in his crime coverage; one of his early pieces, regarding a \"band of murderers\", attacked the police for forcing \"Examiner\" reporters to do their work for them. But while indulging in these stunts, the \"Examiner\" also increased its space for international news, and sent reporters out to uncover municipal corruption and inefficiency. In one celebrated story, \"Examiner\" reporter Winifred Black was admitted into a San Francisco hospital and discovered that indigent women were treated with \"gross cruelty\". The entire hospital staff was fired the morning the piece appeared.\n\nWith the \"Examiner\"'s success established by the early 1890s, Hearst began shopping for a New York newspaper. Hearst purchased the \"New York Journal\" in 1895, a penny paper that Pulitzer's brother Albert had sold to a Cincinnati publisher the year before.\n\nMetropolitan newspapers started going after department store advertising in the 1890s, and discovered the larger circulation base, the better. This drove Hearst; following Pulitzer's earlier strategy, he kept the \"Journal\"'s price at one cent (compared to The \"World\"s two cent price) while doubling the size to 16 pages. Crime news featured big bold headlines, and startling graphic art. The approach worked, and as the \"Journal\"s circulation jumped to 150,000, Pulitzer had to cut his price to a penny, hoping to drive his young competitor (who was subsidized by his family's fortune) into bankruptcy. In a counterattack, Hearst raided the staff of the \"World\" in 1896. In the 1880s Pulitzer had annoyed his rivals when he raided their staffs; now it was his turn. Hearst picked off the best journalists, especially those who considered Pulitzer difficult man to work for.\n\nAlthough the competition between the \"World\" and the \"Journal\" was fierce, the papers were temperamentally alike. Both were Democratic, both were sympathetic to labor and immigrants (a sharp contrast to publishers like the \"New York Tribune\"'s Whitelaw Reid, who blamed their poverty on moral defects), and both invested enormous resources in their Sunday publications, which functioned like weekly magazines, going beyond the normal scope of daily journalism.\n\nTheir Sunday entertainment features included the first color comic strip pages, and some theorize that the term yellow journalism originated there, while as noted above the New York Press left the term it invented undefined. The Yellow Kid, a comic strip revolving around a bald child in a yellow nightshirt, became exceptionally popular when cartoonist Richard Outcault began drawing it in the \"World\" in early 1896. When Hearst predictably hired Outcault away, Pulitzer asked artist George Luks to continue the strip with his characters, giving the city two Yellow Kids. The use of \"yellow journalism\" as a synonym for over-the-top sensationalism in the U.S. apparently started with more serious newspapers commenting on the excesses of \"the Yellow Kid papers\".\n\nPulitzer and Hearst are often credited (or blamed) for drawing the nation into the Spanish–American War with sensationalist stories or outright lying. In fact, the vast majority of Americans did not live in New York City, and the decision makers who did live there probably relied more on staid newspapers like the \"Times\", the \"Sun\" or the \"Post\". The most famous example of the exaggeration is the apocryphal story that artist Frederic Remington telegrammed Hearst to tell him all was quiet in Cuba and \"There will be no war.\" Hearst responded \"Please remain. You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war.\" The story (a version of which appears in the Hearst-inspired Orson Welles' film \"Citizen Kane\") first appeared in the memoirs of reporter James Creelman in 1901, and there is no other source for it.\n\nBut Hearst was a war hawk after a rebellion broke out in Cuba in 1895. Stories of Cuban virtue and Spanish brutality soon dominated his front page. While the accounts were of dubious accuracy, the newspaper readers of the 19th century did not need, or necessarily want, his stories to be pure nonfiction. Historian Michael Robertson has said that \"Newspaper reporters and readers of the 1890s were much less concerned with distinguishing among fact-based reporting, opinion and literature.\"\n\nHearst's treatment was more effective and focused on the enemy who set the bomb—and offered a huge reward to readers. Pulitzer, though lacking Hearst's resources, kept the story on his front page. The yellow press covered the revolution extensively and often inaccurately, but conditions on Cuba were horrific enough. The island was in a terrible economic depression, and Spanish general Valeriano Weyler, sent to crush the rebellion, herded Cuban peasants into concentration camps and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Having clamored for a fight for two years, Hearst took credit for the conflict when it came: A week after the United States declared war on Spain, he ran \"How do you like the Journal's war?\" on his front page. In fact, President William McKinley never read the \"Journal\", and newspapers like the \"Tribune\" and the \"New York Evening Post\", both staunchly Republican, demanded restraint. Moreover, journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism was largely confined to New York City, and that newspapers in the rest of the country did not follow their lead. The \"Journal\" and the \"World\" were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers, and the stories simply did not make a splash outside Gotham. War came because public opinion was sickened by the bloodshed, and because conservative leaders like McKinley realized that Spain had lost control of Cuba. These factors weighed more on the president's mind than the melodramas in the \"New York Journal\".\n\nHearst sailed directly to Cuba, when the invasion began, as a war correspondent, providing sober and accurate accounts of the fighting. Creelman later praised the work of the reporters for exposing the horrors of Spanish misrule, arguing, \"no true history of the war ... can be written without an acknowledgment that whatever of justice and freedom and progress was accomplished by the Spanish–American War was due to the enterprise and tenacity of yellow journalists, many of whom lie in unremembered graves.\"\n\nHearst placed his newspapers at the service of the Democrats during the 1900 presidential election. He later campaigned for his party's presidential nomination, but lost much of his personal prestige when columnist Ambrose Bierce and editor Arthur Brisbane published separate columns months apart that called for the assassination of McKinley. When McKinley was shot on September 6, 1901, the Republican press went livid, accusing Hearst of driving Leon Czolgosz to the deed. Hearst did not know of Bierce's column and claimed to have pulled Brisbane's after it ran in a first edition, but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life and all but destroyed his presidential ambitions.\n\nPulitzer, haunted by his \"yellow sins\", returned the \"World\" to its crusading roots as the new century dawned. By the time of his death in 1911, the \"World\" was a widely respected publication, and would remain a leading progressive paper until its demise in 1931.\n\nIn many movies, sitcoms and other works of fiction, reporters often use yellow journalism against the main character, which typically works to set up the reporter character as an antagonist. This is done so often that it is sometimes considered to be a cliché.\n\nFor instance in the Spider-Man franchise, publisher J. Jonah Jameson spitefully and constantly smears the superhero in his \"Daily Bugle\" despite having his suspicions repeatedly proven wrong. Likewise, in the 1997 James Bond movie \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", the deranged media magnate and main antagonist Elliot Carver (played by Jonathan Pryce) tries to start a war between Great Britain and China via sensationalized news stories; in the movie, he even alludes to Hearst's role in the Spanish–American War, using the apocryphal quote \"You provide the pictures and I'll provide the war\" as an excuse to prove that his plot is not new. (This quotation is also in Orson Welles' classic film \"Citizen Kane\".) In Thomas Harris' novel \"Red Dragon\", from the Hannibal Lecter series, a sleazy yellow journalist named Freddy Lounds, who writes for the \"National Tattler\" tabloid, is tortured and set aflame for penning a negative article about serial killer Francis Dolarhyde.\n\nIn the movie \"Bob Roberts\", Senator Roberts characterises media investigations into his business dealings (and particularly the links between his anti-drugs charity and CIA drug trafficking) as \"yellow journalism\".\n\nWhile the English language press served the general population, practically every ethnic group had its own newspapers in their own language. Many immigrant populations in the 19th century were drawn to the rich farmlands of the Great Plains states such as Minnesota, Nebraska, and Iowa. In small communities that drew large influxes of specific ethnic groups community newspapers became a place where political and religious interests could be promoted in familiar languages. Many of these papers also wanted to embody the spirit of American democracy within their readers. One paper committed to ensuring all Danish-American citizens took part and exercised their rights was the Den Danske Pionerr or The Danish Pioneer in translation. This paper was backed by Sophus F. Neble a Danish immigrant who had failed at dairy farming and instead set to typing and enhancing the paper in Omaha, Nebraska. Under Neble that paper rose to a circulation of 40,000 during World War I.\n\nGerman publishers were one of the most influential immigrant groups in developing the ethnic press. By 1890 there were 1,000 German-language newspapers published each year in the United States. Prior to World War I Germans were accepted as a reputable immigrant group with over five million immigrants moving to the country between 1820 and 1924. However once America entered the conflict national opinion changed and German culture was no longer welcome in the country. A large amount of anger was focused at German newspapers which some American's viewed as supporting Germany in the war effort. In October 1917 Congress passed legislation that sought to control foreign-language press. The laws stated that newspapers must translate all printed material concerning the war. The German papers nearly all folded in World War I, and after 1950 the other ethnic groups had largely dropped foreign language papers. This drop of foreign-press publications during World War I was not only felt by German-Americans. In 1915 the circulation of the daily Yiddish newspapers was half a million in New York City alone, and 600,000 nationally. In addition thousands more subscribed to the numerous weekly papers and the many magazines.\n\nRepresentative was the situation in Chicago, where the Polish Americans sustained diverse political cultures, each with its own newspaper. In 1920 the community had a choice of five daily papers - from the Socialist \"Dziennik Ludowy\" [People's daily] (1907–25) to the Polish Roman Catholic Union's \"Dziennik Zjednoczenia\" [Union daily] (1921–39) - all of which supported workers' struggles for better working conditions and were part of a broader program of cultural and educational activities. The decision to subscribe to a particular paper reaffirmed a particular ideology or institutional network based on ethnicity and class, which lent itself to different alliances and different strategies. Most papers preached assimilation into middle class American values and supported Americanization programs, but still included news of the home country.\n\nAfter 1965, there was a large surge of new immigration, especially from Asia. They set up few major papers. By the 21st century, over 10 percent of the population was Hispanic. They patronized Spanish-language radio and television, but outside large cities it was hard to find Spanish newspapers, books or magazines for sale.\n\nE. W. Scripps founder of the first national newspaper chain in the United States, sought in the early years of the 20th century to create syndicated services based on product differentiation while appealing to the needs of his readers. Success, Scripps believed, depended on providing what competing newspapers did not. To achieve this end while controlling costs and centralizing management, Scripps developed a national wire service (United Press', a news features service (Newspaper Enterprise Association), and other services. Scripps successfully reached a large market at low costs in new and different ways and captured the interests of a wider range of readers, especially women who were more interested in features than in political news. However, the local editors lost a degree of autonomy and local news coverage diminished significantly.\n\nIn part to aid in his political ambitions, Hearst opened newspapers in other cities, among them Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston. By the mid-1920s he had a nationwide string of 28 newspapers, among them the \"Los Angeles Examiner\", the \"Boston American\", the \"Chicago Examiner\", the \"Detroit Times\", the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" and the \"Washington Times\" and \"Washington Herald\" and his flagship the \"San Francisco Examiner\". In 1924 he opened the \"New York Daily Mirror\", a racy tabloid frankly imitating the \"New York Daily News\". Among his other holdings were the magazines \"Cosmopolitan\", and \"Harper's Bazaar\"; two news services, Universal News and International News Service; King Features Syndicate; and a film company, Cosmopolitan Productions, as well as real estate. Hearst used his influence to help Franklin D. Roosevelt win the 1932 Democratic nomination. However he broke with Roosevelt in 1935 because Roosevelt did not want to fund the veterans' bonus. After that the Hearst chain became the bitter enemy of the New Deal from the right. The other major chains likewise were hostile, and in 1936 Roosevelt had the support of only 10% of the nation's newspapers (by circulation).\n\nA 2015 report from the Brookings Institution shows that the number of newspapers per hundred million population fell from 1,200 (in 1945) to 400 in 2014. Over that same period, circulation per capita declined from 35 percent in the mid-1940s to under 15 percent. The number of newspaper journalists has decreased from 43,000 in 1978 to 33,000 in 2015. Other traditional news media have also suffered. Since 1980 the television networks have lost half their audience for evening newscasts; the audience for radio news has shrunk by 40%.\n\nThe circulation of the nation's daily newspapers plunged since 2006, in one of the sharpest declines in recent history. The slide continues a decades-long trend and adds to the woes of a mature industry already struggling with layoffs and facing the potential sale of some of its flagships. In addition newsstand sales of magazines fell more than 4 percent, to about 48.7 million copies. Among domestic newsweeklies, \"Time\" magazine reported the biggest drop. Analysts pointed to the increased use of the Internet, noting that more people in 2006 read the \"New York Times\" online than on paper. Newspaper readership goes up with education, and education levels are rising. That favorable trend is offset by the choice of people in each age group to read fewer papers.\n\nThe decline in readership and revenues continued into 2014. American dailies lost 60% of their ad revenue--$30 billion—between 2005 and 2014. The typical response is a drastic cut in the employment of journalists. Their numbers also fell 60% from about 50,000 in 2005 to 20,000 in 2014.\n\nAfter 1950 newspaper readership grew slower than the population. After 1990 the number of readers started to decline. The number of papers also declined, especially as afternoon papers collapsed in the face of television news. However sales of advertising remained strong and profits were still high. In 2002, newspapers reported advertising revenues of $44 billion. According to Morton Research, a market analysis firm, in 2003, the 13 major publicly traded newspaper companies earned an average pretax profit margin of 19 percent.\n\nFrom 1987 to 2003 showed an industry in transition. Although 305 newspapers ceased daily publication during this period, 64% of these newspapers continued to serve their markets as weeklies, merged dailies, or zoned editions. The 111 dailies that went out of business were offset by 63 dailies that started publication. In effect, the newspaper industry lost service in 48 markets during 17 years. After 2003 the process speeded up, as revenue from advertising fell and circulation declined, as more people relied on the internet for news.\n\nThe first Spanish-language newspapers in the United States were \"El Misisipí\" and \"El Mensagero Luisianés\", which began publication in New Orleans in 1808 and 1809. \"La Gaceta de Texas\" and \"El Mexicano\", the first newspapers in what is now considered the Southwest, were written and typeset in Nacogdoches, Texas but printed in Natchitoches, Louisiana in 1813. They supported the Mexican independence movement.\n\nThe Latino Print Network estimated the combined circulation of all Hispanic newspapers in the United States at 16.2 million in 2003. Mainstream (English) daily newspapers owned 46 Hispanic publications—nearly all of them weeklies—that have a combined circulation of 2.9 million. From 1990 to 2000, the number of Hispanic newspapers alone nearly doubled from 355 to 652\n\nIn 1976 the \"Miami Herald\" started \"El Herald\", a one-page Spanish insert that was reborn in 1987 as \"El Nuevo Herald\", a daily supplement to the \"Miami Herald\". \"El Nuevo Herald\" became independent of the \"Herald\" in 1998 and by 2003 had an average daily circulation of 90,300.\nIn 1981, the Gannett chain entered daily Spanish publishing when it bought \"El Diario/La Prensa\", a 52,000-circulation New York City tabloid that is the nation's oldest Spanish daily.\n\nThe Tribune Co., Belo Corp. and Knight Ridder launched daily Spanish-language papers in 2003. Hispanic-oriented newspapers and magazines generated $1.3 billion in revenue in 2002. By comparison, the operating revenue that year for Knight Ridder's 32 papers was $2.8 billion. Readership remains small, however. New York City already had two Spanish-language dailies with a combined circulation of about 100,000, as well as papers from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and a score of weeklies. But Louis Sito said their \"circulation levels were very, very minimal when compared to the population size.\" (New York, population 8 million, is 27 percent Hispanic; the Bronx, 1.3 million, is 48 percent Hispanic.) Sito urged \"Newsday\" publisher Raymond A. Jansen to launch a daily instead of a weekly, and \"Hoy\" premiered on November 16, 1998, with a circulation of 25,000. By 2003, \"Hoy\" sold 91,000 copies a day in the New York metro area. The Dallas-Fort Worth market contains 1.3 million Latinos—22 percent of the population and growing (estimated to reach 38 percent by 2006). The \"Dallas Morning News\" developed \"Al Día\" to entice that audience. The Monday-through-Saturday paper debuted in September 2003 with a staff of 50, an initial circulation of 40,000 and a newsstand price of 25 cents. \"Diario La Estrella\" began in 1994 as a dual-language insert of the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" and first grew into an all-Spanish stand-alone paper with a twice-weekly total circulation of 75,000 copies distributed free via newsstands and selective home delivery.\n\nWith the notable exception of \"Viet Mercury\", a now-defunct, 35,000-circulation weekly Vietnamese-language paper published by Knight Ridder's \"San Jose Mercury News\", U.S. media companies have generally eschewed the Asian market even though daily papers in Chinese, Korean or Vietnamese are thriving in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and other cities. The Mandarin-language \"World Journal\", which distributes from San Francisco to Toronto and states a circulation (unaudited) of 350,000. \"World Journal\"; its biggest competitor, \"Sing Tao\" (181,000 circulation unaudited); and \"Korea Times\" (254,000, also unaudited) are owned by international media giants based in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Seoul, respectively.\n\nIn 2014, \"Connecting Cleveland\", a four-page paper with stories in English and Nepali was launched to serve Nepali-speaking Bhutanese families in the Cleveland, Ohio area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He studied at the Paris Conservatory and sang as a baritone at the Opéra-Comique (1850–55), where he met the soprano Marie Caroline Miolan, whom he married in 1853.\n\nHe then gave up singing and took on the direction of the Théâtre Lyrique in 1856, where he presented works by Beethoven, Mozart, Rossini, Weber, but most importantly opened his doors to new French composers turned down by the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique, such as Berlioz, Gounod, Bizet, Saint-Saëns and Delibes. He also staged the premiere of the revised version in a French translation of Verdi's \"Macbeth in 1865.\n\nIn early 1868 Carvalho started another operatic venture at the Théâtre de la Renaissance. However he was declared bankrupt on 6 May 1868, forcing him out from both theatres.\n\nCarvalho then moved to manage the Théâtre du Vaudeville.

{"id": "7287091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7287091", "title": "Magicians (2007 film)", "text": "Magicians (2007 film)\n\nMagicians is a 2007 British comedy film released on 18 May 2007. It stars comic duo Robert Webb and David Mitchell as stage magicians Karl and Harry. The two magicians compete together in a magic competition, despite their personal differences. Parts and ideas of the film have been taken to parody the 2006 film \"The Prestige\" by Christopher Nolan, though this had not been released when \"Magicians\" was filmed (though the original novel by Christopher Priest had been published in 1995). The film is directed by Andrew O'Connor and written by Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, who are also the writers of the Channel 4 sitcom \"Peep Show\", which stars Mitchell and Webb. Other principal cast members include Jessica Hynes, Darren Boyd, Steve Edge, Peter Capaldi, and Andrea Riseborough.\n\nHarry Kane and Karl Allen are best friends who work together in a successful and popular magic double act, with Harry's wife Carol working as their assistant. After one show, however, Harry discovers Karl and Carol backstage in a magic box having sex (during an agreement between Harry and the theatre owner about letting the act go on for 4 more weeks and letting them do an act on a cruise ship). During the next show, Carol is locked into a guillotine as part of a climatic trick, only for the blade to decapitate her; it is not immediately clear whether Harry, despite his protestations of innocence, has murdered her or whether she was the victim of a freak accident. Four years later, the act has broken up and the two friends – now bitter rivals – have gone their separate ways; Harry, having given up professional magic, is working in a Wilkinson hardware store, only to be fired after a customer complains when he creates an illusion of him cutting his arm severely with a knife blade during a sales pitch, whilst Karl is attempting to reinvent himself as a Derren Brown-esque magician called the Mindmonger, with limited success. During an unsuccessful impromptu-pitch at a television corporation, the only person he manages to impress is Dani, the tea girl, who Karl immediately gets a crush on much to the jealousy of his incompetent agent Otto, who nurses an unsubtle homosexual crush on him.\n\nAfter numerous failed attempts at raising money, Harry sees a poster for the \"Magic shield\" competition held in Jersey, with a prize of £20,000, and decides to enter. Trying to find a new assistant, Harry is forced to recruit the only applicant, Linda, an old work friend whose only entertainment skill is a poor dancing routine. Harry swallows his pride and contacts Karl, who agrees to enter the competition with him; although their reputation in the magic community is still strong enough to get them into the tournament without an audition, the tensions between them ultimately prove too strong and they decide to go solo from that point on. As Harry and Linda rehearse their magic act, they begin to grow closer, but whilst Linda is open about her interest in Harry, he is too uptight and insecure to fully express his reciprocation. Much to his discomfort, Linda discovers the guillotine amongst his magic props and convinces him to use it as the centrepiece of the finale. Karl, meanwhile, is delighted to learn that Dani has come down from London to see him perform, but is slightly alarmed to discover that she believes him to be a genuine psychic. He nevertheless goes along with her belief, particularly as the interest in the competition has seen him approached by a television producer who wants to make him the centrepiece of a psychic show. Karl agrees to make his act for the finale a medium display, but begins to suffer a crisis of conscience. Karl tries a trick where he is buried in sand for a day.\n\nUpon learning that Harry has not told Linda of what happened to his wife, Karl informs her. Harry panics when he discovers that her hotel room is vacant, believing she has returned to London. He conquers his fear of flying to immediately fly back to London, only to discover as soon as he gets there that she has merely switched rooms and forgotten to inform him. Managing to return to Jersey in time to compete by telling Linda to make one of the judges delay the act, both Harry and Karl make it through to the final; Linda claims that she is okay with hearing about what happened to Carol, but tensions between both begin to grow as she struggles to trust him. The night of the finale, Harry is heartbroken to learn that Linda has apparently slept with another magician, the sleazy and unethical Tony White; although Linda confirms it, she is lying in an attempt to force Harry to open up about his feelings, which he is still unable to do. Karl, meanwhile, finally prepares to consummate his relationship with Dani, but admits that he is not a true psychic after she thinks he is contacting her dead father, and betrayed, she shuns him.\n\nThat night, Karl and Harry have a confrontation backstage, in which Karl accuses Harry of murdering Carol; Harry angrily rejects the accusation and challenges that Karl merely finds it easier to believe that rather than accept the guilt of betraying his best friend. On stage, Karl begins to pioneer his psychic act, but the stooge he has hired in the crowd which he had chosen with a fake random ball toss, accidentally trips and concusses himself on the stage. Upon hearing the sad story of another selected audience member, he decides that he cannot perpetuate the fraud, admitting to the audience that he is not able to contact the dead. As a result, Dani forgives him. Harry, as 'The Black Widower', starts his guillotine act, but at the moment of truth Linda's nerve fails her and she flees the stage. Although Harry’s act would appear to be ruined when he asks if anybody else wants to try, Karl steps forward and announces that he will face the guillotine instead. Karl allows himself to be locked in the guillotine, explaining that Carol was frequently unfaithful and forced Karl to have sex with her. Harry appears to decapitate Karl – although it is merely an illusion, and Karl appears unharmed, the trick having worked perfectly. Harry wins the competition, and in his acceptance speech both forgives Karl and admits that he loves Linda, who joins him on stage and the two kiss. Their friendship mended, Karl and Harry embark on a reunion tour, incorporating Dani and Linda into the act as their assistants.\n\n\nThe magic consultant for the film was Scott Penrose who also appears as Magibot.\n\nSome of the U.K.'s leading real life magicians Aladin, Ali Bongo and Patrick Page make cameo appearances in the film.\n\nThe duo had not expected to star in a film at this point of their careers, with Mitchell stating that \"it probably came much earlier than we thought we would do a film. It landed very fortuitously on our doormat.\" At first, Mitchell and Webb were not considered for the roles of Harry and Karl, but O'Connor changed his mind \"it became clear they could do these parts really well. And we thought, well, wouldn't it be great to do our first movie with people we know, because we really admire and enjoy working with them\". Unlike most other Mitchell and Webb projects, Olivia Colman does not have a main part in the film. O'Connor explained that \"Olivia was part of the development and did some read-throughs with us. I guess our feeling was that because of the relationship between [Mitchell and Webb] and Olivia in \"Peep Show\", to have taken that same relationship, it would have been a really weird thing for the audience. I must say I think she'd have been great in the part, she was great in the read-throughs, I just thought we couldn't have done that.\" Mitchell admitted, the day before the film's release, that he \"really got into\" his role as Harry.\n\nMitchell and Webb were taught basic magical skills for the film, with them each receiving \"welcome pack of DVDs telling the history of magic\". Andrew O'Connor was a member of The Magic Circle but was thrown out for revealing secrets, so he and Scott Penrose taught Mitchell and Webb magical skills. Webb spent two weeks \"trying to roll a coin across [his] fingers and [he] still couldn't do it\", with Mitchell admitting that \"magic proved far more problematic than we anticipated\". Webb stated that the worst part that he had to film \"was being buried up to the neck in sand. It's not the most comfortable place to be. I'd be buried for 30 minutes at a time, which doesn't sound that long, but it was the middle of summer and there were a lot of wasps around.\" Mitchell had to kiss Jessica Hynes in the film, but admitted that he would have preferred to have kissed Robert Webb as he had done in \"Peep Show\", which he claimed to have been easier, as for that scene he had to \"look absolutely rigid at the time\". On the subject of the scene with Hynes, he stated that \"the scene went surprisingly well considering we had to do it in front of 700 extras, but if I'd had a single moment more to think about it I'd have been mortified with embarrassment.\" Whilst filming in Nottingham, unit signs being used in the film were repeatedly being stolen by teenagers as they had the word \"magic\" on them. Multiple signs had to be ordered, at £3 each. The magic shield competition takes place in Jersey, but the filming for these was done in Skegness.\n\nThe film opened on 251 screens on 18 May 2007, grossing £366,188 in its first weekend - a sum described as \"healthy\" but \"low-key\" by \"Variety\". Overall it charted fairly poorly at the box office, generating £154,822 in its second week, placing it sixth at the British box office, before dropping to 20th with £25,404 the following week, and to 32nd with $3,766 the next, before dropping out of the chart. Its total gross was £885,174.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews. \"Empire\" reviewer Olly Richards gave \"Magicians\" three stars, concluding that \"The bumbling charms of the stars just about pull this through, but there'll be few calls for an encore come the final curtain.\" Derek Malcolm said that Mitchell and Webb \"don't exactly cover themselves with glory in their first feature film. But they just about reach par.\" Going to describe the film as a \"bit of a mess\", although it \"raises a few laughs\". Alison Rowat called \"Magicians\" \"an hour of OK telly trying to pass as a film\", and gave it two stars. This assessment was shared by Leslie Felperin of \"Variety\", who saw it as an \"attenuated TV episode\", with only \"mildly amusing results\", that was not as funny as \"Peep Show\". Stuart McGurk gave a negative review, citing that \"for a much-anticipated film, this is a huge let-down\", and that it lacks \"the eclectic off-key cruelty and spot-on zingers of the much-revered \"Peep Show\"\", although he did say that the film \"still has the odd good line\", but concluded by saying that anyone \"expecting anything else will be sorely disappointed\". \"The Guardian\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Phelim O'Neill gave \"Magicians\" two stars, calling it \"\"Peep Show\" the sequel\", and stated that \"O'Connor's direction has absolutely zero visual flair, making the performers' transition from television to film rather pointless.\" \"The Times\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> Dominic Maxwell decided that \"\"Magicians\" doesn't have the brio (or great gags), let alone the marketability, of a \"Bridget Jones\".\" Caroline Westbrook gave the film three stars, and gave it an even review, stating that \"There's a lot to like about \"Magicians\", especially if you're a fan of Mitchell and Webb\", although it \"ultimately feels as though it's lacking something\". She concluded that \"It's a perfectly agreeable way to while away an hour and a half - but don't expect to remember much about it in the morning.\" Digital Spy gave the film a positive review, and three stars concluding that \"A must for magic and \"Peep Show\" fans alike, with some original and brilliant comedy moments.\"\n\n"}

It also allows the users to report malicious and/or unsuitable content. The best links of the day are added to the front page in the form of headlines.\n\nOnly members can submit links, but anyone can anonymously vote and view links. Members collect points by, among other things, submitting highly voted links. Experience points grant members increased access to the website's features and allow submission of more links per day.\n\n\"MilkandCookies\" came about when Jaxon Brooks' personal website merged with Hellroy's Junkmail mailing list. Jaxon's site started around 1995 as a static personal bookmarks page saved out of Netscape Navigator and posted to his personal account. It followed him as he jumped from ISP to ISP. Along the way it became a dynamic site with the ability to post links directly through the sites administrative interface. It also became searchable and browsable with categories.\n\nShortly after that Hellroy's Junkmail mailing list started. It was created to make it easier to email links to people who actually wanted to receive them. As part of a regular exercise, he would email highly offensive content to the list to weed out the sensitive.\n\nIn 1998, Jaxon and Hellroy decided that they hated their jobs and brain-stormed an online venture called MilkandCookies.com. The domain was registered Thursday, May 14, 1998. But they soon realized that they would not be able to play \"\" and \"Quake II\", and surf the web all day, if they worked for themselves. The idea was scrapped.\n\nThe MilkandCookies.com domain name came out of just a few brainstorming sessions between Jaxon and Hellroy. Even by 1998, most of the single word and other short names were taken, so the focus turned toward names that were easy to remember. They also wanted a name that had to do with pop culture and, although they loved to offend, they wanted a name that would be inviting.\n\nJunkmail and Jaxon's personal page merged in early 1999 with the MilkandCookies name. In December of that year, Jaxon junked the code that he had been hacking together for the last 4 years and went with a packaged Content Management System (CMS). All links were transferred over by hand.\n\nIn November 2006, Jaxon hired Skiplogic to help rewite the MilkandCookies backend from scratch. This effort came to fruition on June 10, 2007, when the old code was abandoned and the new code went live. The rollout included many improvements and several new features.\n\nThis site was covered more than once on TechTV. Cat Schwartz called it the \"Funniest Site on the Net\".\n\nIt was routinely ranked as a top site on the web by sites like Technorati, and Alexa Internet.\n\n\n"}

The campaign's name comes from the Japanese pronunciation of Portland, spelled backwards. The video's theme song is performed by the Portland-based rock band Ages and Ages in Japanese, with some English words and phrases such as \"breakfast\", \"crazy donuts\", and \"ice cream\".

Courtney Joyner and David Schmoeller, and directed by David DeCoteau. It is the third film in the \"Puppet Master\" franchise, a prequel to 1989's \"Puppet Master\" and 1991's \"Puppet Master II\", and stars Guy Rolfe as a puppeteer whose ability to animate lifeless material attracts the attention of the Nazis, whose members are played by Richard Lynch, Ian Abercrombie, and Walter Gotell.\n\n\"Toulon's Revenge\", as well as the second, fourth, and installments of the series, are only available in DVD format through a Full Moon Features box set that has since been discontinued. However, in 2007, Full Moon Features reacquired the rights to the first five films, and the box set has since been reissued and is available directly from Full Moon, as well as through several online retailers.\n\nThe film is also available on DVD along with the first two films on a triple feature \"Midnight Horror Collection\" at a budget price. A remastered edition Blu-ray and DVD of the film was released on September 18, 2012.\n\nThe film is set during 1941 in World War II Berlin. A scientist named Dr. Hess is forced by the Nazis, especially his Gestapo liaison Major Kraus, to create a drug capable of animating corpses to use as living shields on the battlefield after losing too many on the Eastern Front. But, Dr. Hess cannot get it right: While the corpses do reanimate, they have a tendency towards mindless violence. In a small theater downtown, André Toulon has set up a politically satirical puppet show for children, starring a six-armed American Old West puppet named Six-Shooter, who attacks an inanimate reconstruction puppet of Adolf Hitler. The show is, next to a crowd of children, also attended by Lt. Erich Stein, Kraus' driver. After the performance, Toulon and his wife Elsa feed the puppets with the formula which sustains their life force, but they are watched by Stein, who informs his superior the next morning. Hess, genuinely fascinated by the formula, wants Toulon to freely share the secret with him, but Kraus wants to take Toulon in for treason and insulting of the Führer.\n\nThe next day, André gives Elsa a puppet crafted in her likeness as a gift, but soon afterwards Kraus, Hess, and a squad of soldiers break into the atelier and take Toulon, Tunneler, and Pinhead. When Elsa attempts to prevent them from taking the formula as well, she is shot by one of the escort, and Toulon is dragged away from her. When Kraus prepares to leave, the wounded Elsa spits at him in defiance, and in retaliation, Kraus shoots her dead in cold blood. However, while transporting Toulon off, the two soldiers guarding him are killed by Pinhead and Tunneler, enabling Toulon to escape.\n\nAfter hiding for the remainder of the night, Toulon returns to his theater to find that the stage has been burnt by the Nazis. He finds Six-Shooter and Jester and leaves with them, then discovers a partially destroyed hospital and decides to set up camp in it. Seeking revenge, Toulon, Pinhead, and Jester break into the morgue to get his wife's life essence and inserts it into the woman puppet he made for her, and as she comes to life, he inserts several leeches he found in a jar into her. Later that night, Toulon carries out the first revenge attack on Stein while he fixes Kraus' car, along with Pinhead, Jester and Leech Woman. On his flight from his pursuers, Toulon subsequently finds shelter in a bombed-out building.\n\nBack in his lab, Dr. Hess is studying Toulon's formula, and desperate to meet and talk with him, he goes back to the old theater. Meanwhile, some friends from the puppet show, a boy named Peter Hertz and his father, find André and decide to live with him after Peter's mother was arrested on charges of espionage. The next day, Toulon sends Six-Shooter to kill General Müller, the supervisor of the Nazi reanimation project, while Müller is visiting a brothel. Six-Shooter manages to kill the general, but Müller shoots off one of the puppet's arms beforehand. Peter goes back to Toulon's old atelier to look for a replacement arm and is caught by Dr. Hess, who treats him kindly and gets him to take him to Toulon.\n\nDr. Hess finds and talks to Toulon, who tells him about the puppets' secret, and the two become friends. But Peter's father betrays Toulon by telling Major Kraus about his hideout in exchange for a pardon for his family. Kraus and his men storm the ruin, but the puppets fight back, enabling Toulon and Hess to escape. Kraus stops Peter and his father, demanding to know where Toulon is; Hertz fights against and is shot by Kraus. While searching the nearby houses, one of Kraus' men is shot by Six-Shooter; but when Hess approaches him, the soldier puts a knife into him before expiring. Hess dies from the injury, telling Toulon to keep fighting. Toulon returns once more to his old theater, where he falls asleep from exhaustion and is soon joined by the now orphaned Peter.\n\nAt night, Major Kraus returns to his office, only to fall prey to an ambush by Toulon and his puppets, now joined by Blade, infused with Hess' essence. Toulon takes terrible revenge on Kraus by hanging him from the ceiling by his limbs and neck, which are impaled by sharp hooks. After having a halberd from Kraus' office decorations planted into the floor, point up, Toulon sets the rope on fire; the rope eventually snaps, and Kraus fatally falls right onto the halberd. The film ends with Toulon, posing as Kraus, and Peter leaving the country for Geneva on the express train.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4250543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4250543", "title": "School Days (visual novel)", "text": "School Days (visual novel)\n\n0verflow announced work on \"School Days\" in October 2004 and marketed it through public venues that showcased the game's innovative use of anime-like cinematics and voice. The game ranked as the best-selling visual novel in Japan for the time of its release, continuing to chart in the national top 50 for nearly five months afterward. 0verflow would then go on to produce multiple sequels including a spin-off of the original story called \"Summer Days\", and a parallel story called \"Cross Days\". Another spin-off, \"Island Days\", has been developed by Klon for the Nintendo 3DS. \"School Days\" was remastered as \"School Days HQ\" on October 8, 2010 and localized in North America on June 27, 2012. The original game was officially discontinued April 21, 2011.\n\nFollowing the game's release, \"School Days\" made several transitions into other media. The original story was adapted into a manga and serialized in the Kadokawa Shoten magazine \"Comp Ace\"; it was later published into two volumes. Comic anthologies, light novels and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several albums of music. An animated television series, two direct-to-video (OVA) single releases, and a concert film were also produced, the first of which became a precursor for an internet meme when its finale was pulled from broadcast.\n\nAs a visual novel, \"School Days\" contains extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation is composed of scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game pauses, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress up to that point in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing, masturbation, oral sex, intercourse, and nudity (both female and male) or a combination thereof. Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of \"School Days HQ\" is uncensored. Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game.\n\nEach route the game takes invariably concludes with an ending specific to the choices made up to that point. Depending on these choices, the outcome of the story will either be good or bad. \"School Days\" became popularly known for its bad endings, which depict the deaths of characters. In one ending titled \"The Bloody Conclusion\", a character's neck is slit open with a dōzuki, causing her to collapse and die in a fountain of blood to the manic laughter of her assailant. In another called \"Eternally\", a character commits suicide leaning over and falling off the roof of a school, landing headfirst on a sidewalk to the horror of other characters. The game's good endings, by contrast, depict the well-being of characters and their relationships. In the ending \"Christmas Eve\", a couple share an embrace in a hotel room as snow falls around a surrounding cityscape. In another titled \"Two Lovers\", a pair of characters agree to have a polyamorous relationship with the male lead instead of rivaling with each other. Because of the numerous alternate endings that can be achieved, players who wish to watch additional endings and sex scenes will have to play through the game more than once.\n\nUnlike traditional visual novels that consist of static characters with subtitled dialogue, \"School Days\" is unusual in that it incorporates motion and voice, making it reminiscent of an animated series. Cinematics naturally play on their own, and players are afforded the ability to pause, fast-forward, and even skip those they've seen before. Male and female voices can be muted, subtitles can be turned on or off and the game can be played from a window or fullscreen ratio. Progress can be saved at any time in up to 100 slots and loaded from either the main menu or during play.\n\n\"School Days\" focuses on the life of Makoto Ito, a first-year high school student living with his divorced and unseen mother in the fictional city of Haramihama. During his second term, he becomes infatuated with Kotonoha Katsura, a soft-spoken schoolmate who shares train rides with him to and from campus. When his homeroom seating plan is rearranged, he becomes acquaintances with Sekai Saionji, an upbeat girl who takes a special interest in his newfound crush, befriending the two and providing them the grounds to meet. In spite of her triumphant efforts however, Sekai becomes jealous of the new couple, having developed feelings for Makoto herself.\n\n\"School Days\" was 0verflow's tenth game to develop. News of \"School Days\" first surfaced on October 5, 2004 when 0verflow posted a link to the game's then-live website and development log on their official site. In the blog, 0verflow revealed that \"School Days\" had been in pre-production for roughly two years and would be a fully animated game. Updates on the development of the game were scheduled for Tuesdays and Fridays, and the company encouraged fans to attend Dream Party 2004, an upcoming anime convention at Tokyo Big Sight in Ariake, on October 11, where it would make its first public showcase of the game and characters. A follow-up of the venue was made on October 15. Toward the end of the month on October 26, 0verflow posted that new information about \"School Days\" would be circulated in the November issue of \"Tech Gian\", an adult magazine published by Enterbrain.\n\nPromotion for the game began shortly after. In a November 6 development post, 0verflow announced that it was planning a public screening of new game material, but was experiencing difficulty acquiring space for it. The company had initially chosen to have the venue in Akihabara but was unable to find a retailer willing to host it, prompting a visit to Osaka the following week. News that the game would contain music by artists such as Minami Kuribayashi, Haruko Momoi, Yozuca* and YURIA was posted on November 30, along with a release date change to February 25, 2005.\n\nOn December 28, 2004, 0verflow released a public trial of \"School Days\" and announced that the company would be attending Comiket 67 at Tokyo Big Sight from December 29 to 30, handing out phonecards to the first 50 visitors to their booth. Two months later, on February 2, 2005, the company announced that the game had been postponed again to April 28. From April 5 to April 8, 0verflow concluded their development log with comments from Soyogi Tōno, Kaname Yuzuki, Tatsuya Hirai, Yuki Matsunaga, Hikaru Isshiki and Hana Yamamoto, the respective voices of Kotonoha, Sekai, Makoto, Otome, Hikari and Setsuna. To address bugs that were later found in the game, 0verflow released a patch to bring \"School Days\" to a stable build of 1.11. \nOn June 26, 2007, 0verflow and Lantis-net radio began to air an internet radio drama called \"Radio School Days\". Broadcasts finished up March 28, 2008 with 39 episodes aired.\n\nOn April 21, 2011, 0verflow announced via their blog that support for \"School Days\" was being discontinued.\n\n\"School Days\" was ported to three other platforms. The first of these was by AiCherry, an interactive movie developer, who announced on August 20, 2007 that it had picked up the game for development, releasing it as a four disc DVD game on September 28. That same year, on August 31, Interchannel posted a link on their blog to the official website of \"School Days L×H\", a PlayStation 2 (PS2) port in development by Guyzware, that would be edited of explicit sexual content. The game was released on January 17, 2008 and assessed by the Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO), Japan's primary video game content rating system, receiving a 15-years-or-older \"C\" rating for sexual themes and profanity. The third and final port was developed by PalaceGame for the PlayStation Portable (PSP). After postponing the game on May 11, it was released as four UMDs on June 30, 2010.\n\n0verflow opened what would become the homepage for \"School Days HQ\" on May 21, 2010, a remastering of the original game initially scheduled for release in August. The site was finished June 3, and on July 16, the game was postponed to September 24. A trial was publicly released for download on August 7, and from August 20 to September 28, 0verflow promoted the game. Customers who had purchased the original \"School Days\" would be given the opportunity to upgrade to \"HQ\" for a fee until October 11, by either mailing in their game disc or visiting stores in Akihabara, Osaka or Nagoya. Distributors offered collectable phonecards for reservations, and after a second date change on September 10, the game was released October 8.\n\nOn March 3, 2011, 0verflow acknowledged Sekai Project, an unofficial fan translation group, who had reportedly begun localizing \"School Days\" in April 2006. Partnering with American distributor JAST USA, \"School Days HQ\", uncensored in English, was announced for a North American release on March 11, 2011. Development instead continued into 2012, and on May 18, JAST announced that the company had begun taking pre-orders for the Collector's Edition, a bundled release of the game packaged with a keychain and mousepad. The company announced weeks later on June 1 that \"School Days HQ\" had gone gold. Following news on June 26 that the company would exhibit the game at Anime Expo 2012, JAST made an update to the June 1 announcement that \"School Days HQ\" had begun shipping. The downloadable version of the game was later released on August 6.\n\nIn a national sales ranking of bishōjo games in \"PCNEWS\", a now-defunct Japanese online magazine, \"School Days\" premiered as the number one game sold for the second half of April 2005, the second and seventeenth for the first and second halves of May, the fifth and twenty-sixth for the first and second halves of June, and twenty-seventh for the first half of July. The \"School Days\" renewal edition, released a week after the previous ranking, continued to chart on behalf of the game; it ranked as the thirty-third most sold game for the second half of July, before ending as the thirty-fifth and forty-ninth for the first and second halves of August.\n\nGetchu.com, a major distributor of visual novels and domestic anime products, recorded similar sales. \"School Days\" for Windows premiered as the number one game sold for the month of its release, and seventh most for May, ranking as the number one game sold for the first half of 2005 and ninth for the year. The following year, the \"School Days\" renewal edition charted as the twentieth most sold game for July 2007, dropping to thirtieth from August to October. \"School Days HQ\" ranked as the sixth most sold game for October 2010 but failed to chart thereafter.\n\nAccording to \"Gamasutra\", a video gaming news site, \"School Days L×H\" ranked as the number one PlayStation 2 game sold for January 2008.\n\n0verflow developed several visual novels related to \"School Days\", sharing the same universe. Prior to the development of \"School Days\", 0verflow developed the \"Radish Vacation\" visual novel series. The first is \"Snow Radish Vacation\" released on December 28, 2001, followed by \"Summer Radish Vacation\" on April 1, 2003 and finally \"Summer Radish Vacation 2\" on August 13, 2004.\n\nA spin-off titled \"Summer Days\", was released on June 23, 2006, retelling the original game during summer vacation and from the perspective of Setsuna Kiyoura. Unlike its predecessor, however, \"Summer Days\" was almost universally panned for its heavily bugged state, loads of patches, and recall. Another spin-off titled \"Cross Days\" was released on March 19, 2010. Set in the same continuity as \"School Days\", \"Cross Days\" follows the life of another protagonist, Yuuki Ashikaga, a high school freshman who also finds himself caught between the affection of two girls, Roka Kitsuregawa and Kotonoha Katsura, during his second term at Sakakino Academy. The game also features yaoi scenarios, during which Yuuki cross-dresses as a maid. 0verflow released \"Shiny Days\" on February 2, 2012 which establishes a solid link between the \"Days\" series and \"Radish Vacation\" series. A third spin-off, \"Island Days\", was developed for the Nintendo 3DS and was released in Japan on July 3, 2014. The game, developed by Klon, focuses on Makoto and the girls becoming trapped on a remote island and includes tower defense elements.\n\nBased on the story of the original game, \"School Days\" was reimagined as a manga, illustrated by Homare Sakazuki and serialized in the Kadokawa Shoten magazine \"Comp Ace\" from May 26, 2006 to September 26, 2007. On July 12, 2007, 0verflow announced that the manga had been collected into its first volume, comprising five chapters set to be released on July 26. Later that year, the second and final volume, comprising the remaining seven chapters, was released on November 26.\n\nVarious artists also produced short manga of \"School Days\" that were compiled into two comic anthologies. The \"School Days Comic Anthology\" was released by Ohzora Publishing on October 25, 2005 under their P-mate Comics imprint, containing nine short manga by individual artists. On February 25, 2008, Ichijinsha printed the \"School Days Kotonoha Anthology\" under their DNA Media Comics imprint, a collection of manga primarily featuring the character Kotonoha Katsura.\n\nIn addition to the manga, \"School Days\" was adapted into other print media. The first of these was the \"School Days Visual Guide Book\" published by Jive on September 16, 2005, an artbook of character illustrations, model sheets, screenplay, storyboards and a visual hierarchy of the choices and corresponding scenes in the game. Separate editions for the anime television series and Playstation 2 game were also published, on December 1, 2007 and March 21, 2008, respectively. Collections of production work from the Windows game such as character and environment art, screenplay, artist commentaries and all manufactured promotional items were collected in the on December 16, 2005 and also featured in the \"SummerDays & School Days Visual Collection\" on August 31, 2006.\n\nThe first of four light novels, all illustrated by Junji Goto, was written by Ryuna Okada and printed by Harvest Publishing under their Harvest Novels imprint. Released on December 1, 2005, retells the original story from the perspective of Sekai. Okada would follow up the book with on January 1, 2006, switching to the perspective of Kotonoha. Two light novels were also published by Jive, the first of which was written by Takuya Baba, and printed on December 16, 2005, and a second by Hiro Akiduki, \"School Days: Innocent Blue\", released on April 28.\n\n\"School Days\" was adapted into a twelve-episode anime television series by TNK. Concrete news of this first appeared on June 1, 2007, when 0verflow announced via its blog that the show's official website had gone live. Stations participating in the broadcast included TV Kanagawa, Chiba TV, TV Aichi, TV Osaka, TV Saitama and AT-X, the premiere of which would air on TV Kanagawa on July 3. The anime was aired until September 27 and finished its broadcast on AT-X. From September 26, 2007 to February 27, 2008, the series was compiled into six limited and regular edition DVDs.\n\nTNK also produced two direct-to-video (OVA) episodes of \"School Days\". The first, titled \"Valentine Days\", was bundled with limited edition copies of \"School Days L×H\", and features an unrelated comedic romp through Valentine's Day as Kotonoha, Sekai, and Otome try to give Makoto giri chocos. The second, \"Magical Heart Kokoro-chan\", jaunts the series into magical girl territory, portraying Kokoro Katsura as the superheroine Magical Heart; it was released on March 26, 2008.\n\nDiscotek Media has acquired the television series and the \"Magical Heart Kokoro-chan\" OVA to be released on DVD on June 24, 2014 with English subtitles.\n\nOn September 17, 2007, the day before the twelfth and final episode of the televised anime was to air on TV Kanagawa, a sixteen-year-old girl murdered her forty-five-year-old father in their Kyoto home with an axe. TV Kanagawa promptly cancelled the Tuesday airing of the finale for its similarly violent content, replacing it instead with a thirty-minute video compilation of scenery footage from Norway, played to August Wilhelmj's \"Air on the G String\". Newspapers such as \"The Japan Times\" and \"Mainichi Shimbun\" reported on the killing and episode preempt on September 19. According to \"Mainichi Shimbun\", Chiba TV and TV Aichi had also cancelled their airings, with AT-X the only station remaining indecisive. 0verflow issued an apology through their blog the same day, asking viewers to stay tuned for updates. In the following week, 0verflow announced that it had arranged for two screenings of the edited finale at the Akihabara 3D Theater on September 27. Those wishing to attend would be required to register a seat by email, be at least 18 years old with photo ID, and bring a Windows copy of \"School Days\" or \"Summer Days\". That same day AT-X announced that it had decided to air the unedited finale on September 27 and October 1.\n\nIn the wake of the broadcast change, a screen capture of the Norwegian M/S Skagastøl from the slideshow surfaced on the Internet alongside the caption \"Nice boat.\", a phrase which gained popularity in Japan. Google Trends recorded a spike in \"Nice Boat\" searches around the third-quarter of 2007 while \"Yomiuri Shinbun\", a Japanese newspaper, reported that \"Nice boat\" was the tenth most popular Yahoo! Japan search from September 17 to September 23.\n\n\"Nice Boat\" had become so well known that it was used in other media. The meme appeared as an Easter egg in the first episode of \"\", and was parodied on February 13, 2009 when the Kadokawa Pictures YouTube channel uploaded a short montage of sailboats instead of the previously scheduled premiere of \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\". 0verflow capitalized on the popularity of the phrase, naming their booth at Comiket 73 \"Nice boat.\" and selling meme-inspired merchandise. TNK also paid homage to the meme in \"Magical Heart Kokoro-chan\", a special direct-to-video episode of the animated series.\n\nBesides the video releases of the \"School Days\" anime, a concert film, the \"School Days Secret Live DVD\", was also produced by HOBiRECORDS. Released on June 26, 2006 in conjunction with \"Summer Days\", the film contains footage of a concert held on June 15, 2005 featuring the performances of Miyuki Hashimoto, YURIA, rino, yozuca* and Minami Kuribayashi.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, Lantis published six albums of \"School Days\" music. The \"School Days Vocal Album\", a compilation featuring all nine of the game's closing themes, as performed by artists yozuca*, Miyuki Hashimoto, YURIA, Halko Momoi, Minami Kuribayashi, rino, and Kanako Ito was the first to be distributed, sharing its April 28, 2005 date with the release of the game itself. The remaining twenty-eight background scores, composed by KIRIKO/HIKO Sound, were released on July 21, officially completing the game's soundtrack. Another compilation, the \"School Days Vocal Complete Album\" featuring songs from \"Summer Days\" and \"Cross Days\", was released on October 8, 2010.\n\nThree weeks after the premiere of the televised anime on July 25, 2007, Lantis published the single \"Innocent Blue\" by DeviceHigh, a four-track disc featuring the anime opening of the same name, a disco-inspired song called Dancin' Joker, and their instrumentals. Lantis followed with \"School Days: Ending Theme+\" on August 22, a sixteen-track disc containing all of the show's closing themes and background scores on September 26.\n\nIn addition to music albums, six audio dramas were also produced. \"School Days Little Promise\", a chronicle of Sekai and Setsuna's childhoods, was the first. Featuring music by KIRIKO/HIKO Sound and Kanako Ito, HOBiRECORDS published \"Little Promise\" as a two-disc set, which 0verflow scheduled for release January 27, 2006. Pre-releases were sold at Comiket 69 from December 29 to 30, 2005. Sometime afterward however, 0verflow announced that pre-released copies of Little Promise were defective, and asked customers to mail in their discs for replacements. The release was also postponed to February 24. Lantis released the remaining five dramas. \"School Days Drama CD Vol. 1 Himitsu Hanazono\" (ヒ・ミ・ツの花園), a merrymaking of the series six main girls, was released on August 8, 2007. A second, \"School Days Drama CD Vol 2. Koi no Nou-hau\" (恋のノ・ウ・ハ・ウ), was released October 24, 2007. Radio School Days was compiled into three separate albums: was released on November 21, 2007, on February 6, 2008, and on June 21.\n\nConsiderable effort was made to market and promote \"School Days\" before and after its release, including the sale of brand merchandise and use of incentives. Through public venues and through the company's online store, 0verflow sold brand keystraps, mousepads, phonecards, book covers, mugs, t-shirts, dakimakura cases, PVC figures, lanyards, business card holders and cosplay material such as the girls' school uniforms and plastic dōzuki.\n\n\"UK Anime Network\", a British online anime and manga magazine, gave the television series a 7 out of 10, summarizing it as \"An utter subversion of the high school romance genre, which is disturbing and unsettling... yet oddly compelling in its own way.\" \"THEM Anime Reviews\", a website devoted to the review of anime, gave the series a less favorable 1 out of 5 stars, citing \"overblown, shallow, and flat\" characters and that although \"\"School Days\" looks fascinating when you see screenshots of it and read episode guides\", the reviewer found it to be \"annoying, stupid, mean-spirited, and full of some of the biggest idiots [he had] seen in an anime in a long time.\"\n\nOn June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed \"School Days\" among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.\n\n\n"}

The first private channels started in 1990. Colour transmissions started in 1972 after two years of test transmissions, with all programming transmitted in color from 1977, and colour commercials, which started in 1978. Currently, television is one of the leading mass media of the country, and by 2008 was in 99.7% of households in Spain according to INE statistics.\n\nUntil recently terrestrial television was considered an essential public service. Broadcasting is managed both directly by the State and indirectly, through controlled concessions to private firms. The Audiovisual Law of 2010 changed this by defining radio and television as commercial services that individuals pay for, fostering liberalization within some constraints.\n\nAnalogue terrestrial television in Spain began on 28 October 1956. Televisión Española (now La 1) was the very first regular television channel, and operated alone until 1966, when a second channel (now La 2) was launched. La 1 and La 2 were the only authorized television channels in Spain until 1982, when Euskal Telebista was launched in the Basque Country and, in the following year, TV3 in Catalonia, thus ending TVE's monopoly. More channels were launched in the 1980s, each broadcasting to their respective autonomous communities: Canal 9, Canal Sur, Telemadrid, and Televisión de Galicia (TVG), prior to the full liberalization of television with the law of 1989 which permitted the establishment of private commercial channels.\n\nAntena 3, Telecinco and Canal+ were launched in 1990, in January, March and September respectively, finishing the public television monopoly in Spain. Through the 1990s and 2000s (decade), more autonomic channels (most of them public, but some of them private) were launched, and all of them created FORTA, a union of public autonomic channels. Many local channels were also launched, some of them created the Localia Network. During the 1990s, dozens of local channels started broadcasting without a license. The government declared that channels that proved to be operating for a long time could go on working, but blocked new unlicensed channels.\n\nIn the 2000s (decade), the analog national and autonomic channels started simulcast on digital terrestrial television. In 2005, Canal+ stopped its analog service to move to Digital Plus and was substituted by Cuatro. Some weeks later, the last analog national private channel, La Sexta, started testing broadcasts, to begin its regular analog schedule in 2006. In 2009, the analog service started its closure in a process that lasted one year. On 3 April 2010 the analog service was officially discontinued but there are still some small local analog channels operating, most of them the unlicensed analog channels.\n\nThe development of digital terrestrial television was very similar to the failure of ITV Digital in the United Kingdom. Digital terrestrial television was introduced in the country by the pay per view platform Quiero Television. In May 2002, statewide operators were required to start broadcasting in DVB-T. Yet, Quiero TV ceased transmissions in 2002 after a commercial failure. Unlike the UK, the three and half multiplexes left by the platform were not reassigned to other operators, and so 5 channels were squashed into a single multiplex.\n\nOn 30 November 2005, digital terrestrial television was relaunched as a free service with 20 channels and 14 radio stations, along with 23 regional- and local-language channels in their respective areas. Currently about 95% of the population can receive DTT. Each multiplex has a minimum of 4 SD channels each or one HD channel. Televisió de Catalunya and Aragón Televisión are using spare bandwidth in their own digital multiplex to broadcast test HD streams.\n\nDigital cable is slowly replacing the aging analogue service of the major cable provider Ono. Telecable, a cable ISP operating in Asturias has begun trials for 1000 mega bytes per second service and is the first to broadcast HD channels. \nR, a cable operator in Galicia, has completely switched pay TV to digital (DVB-C) by 2008 but free channels are simulcast as analog services, so users without a set-top box can watch them (including most free-to-air channels available on digital terrestrial TV in each location).\n\nDigital satellite services has existed since 1997 from Astra and Hispasat satellites. The Movistar+ pay platform has carried some HDTV tests on Astra 19.2°E on 16 June 2005. This platform (before Canal+) has a lot of exclusives channels as \"#0\" by February 2016 without having to pay the licence of the brand Canal+.\n\nA high definition version of Canal+ 1 (Canal+ 1 HD) now is called \"#0\"; started on 29 January 2008, together with HD versions of Canal+ Deportes (now movistar Deportes) and Canal+ DCine (now movistar Dcine) broadcast from Astra 1KR.\n\nDuring 2007 Telefónica ran trials of VDSL services up to 52 Mbit/s - However, the results were not as good as expected. For this reason, Telefónica will use FTTH for future IPTV services.\nNow Telefónica use Movistar+ in IPTV and Satellite.\n\nAnalogue service was discontinued in April 2010. Since then, all national and regional terrestrial channels are digital.\n\n\n\nMonthly viewing shares in August 2018 (Top 10 individual channels):\n\n\n"}

Its original name is \"Posel Smrti\" (). The game features 150 locations and 5 hours of spoken dialogue. \"The Black Mirror\" became a commercial success, with 500,000 units sold worldwide by 2008. It was particularly successful in Germany, under publisher DTP Entertainment. Two sequels, \"\" and \"\", were released. Additionally, a reboot titled \"Black Mirror\" was released on November 28, 2017.\n\nThe story takes place in the 1980s, primarily at Black Mirror, the ancestral manor of the Gordon family located in Scotland. The protagonist, Samuel Gordon, is forced to return to the Black Mirror manor after 12 years absence upon hearing of the death of his grandfather, William Gordon. Despite the mysterious circumstances surrounding William's death, it is considered a suicide by everyone except for Samuel.\n\nUpon his arrival in Black Mirror, Samuel begins his investigation of his grandfather's death. Samuel's investigation soon reveals that his grandfather had interests in the arcane, and up until his death had spent near every waking hour working to uncover the mystery of the Gordon family's curse. From his grandfather's writings and other sources, Samuel discovers that centuries ago, in the 1200s, the Gordon line began with two brothers, Marcus and Mordred Gordon. The eldest, Mordred, was a monster of a man, opening a dark portal known as the Black Mirror deep under where the manor now stands. The younger, Marcus, fought his brother, killing him and containing - but not closing - the Black Mirror. In his dying breath the elder cursed the younger, stating that he and his descendants would be forever cursed until five souls were sacrificed and his evil was unleashed once more. William's notes also speak of five sacred keys required to shut the portal for good, entrusted to different members of the Gordon family. Samuel then begins his quest to seek out the five sacred keys and close the Black Mirror permanently.\n\nAs the story progresses, further strange and unexpected deaths occur to individuals around Black Mirror, each one accompanied by a strange blood red sigil. Samuel travels the land around Black Mirror, visiting a local town, chapel, and sanatorium, and also at one point travels to his family's second manor in Wales to obtain a key there. At long last Samuel obtains the five keys, but moments later also discovers the horrifying truth: he is the killer responsible for all the deaths, ending the lives of the victims in his sleep; this is the nature of the Gordon family curse. Samuel enters the catacombs beneath the mansion, enters the Black Mirror, and using the five keys seals the portal. After this, unable to live with the atrocities he has committed, Samuel jumps from the top of the mansion, falling onto the same spiked fence which killed his grandfather.\n\nThe game is divided into six chapters:\n\n\nThe game's development started in early 2000 with a development team of 5 people. The release date was initially late 2002, but after slight delays, it was released in March 2003.\n\nA few weeks after \"The Black Mirror\"s initial release in the Czech Republic, Marcel Speta of Future Games reported that it was selling adequately and according to company forecasts. GMX Media president Eugene Perry remarked in March 2004 that the game had \"been very successful in every territory\", and Future Games saw it as a \"solid\" seller in the United States. Its global sales left the developer \"extremely satisfied\" by that May, according to Future's Martin Malík. At the time, it had just launched in Germany, and the company was hopeful regarding its performance in the region. It claimed position #1 on Amazon.de's sales rankings upon release, although Carsten Fichtelmann of German publisher DTP Entertainment noted that certain brick and mortar stores had ordered \"very small\" shipments, a decision he considered to be a mistake. \n\n\"The Black Mirror\" ultimately surpassed DTP's sales forecasts and became a hit in Germany. 4players reported that it was \"by far\" Germany's most successful adventure title during 2004's first six months, and that its sales proved the adventure genre's health in the country. That September, DTP reiterated that it was performing \"extremely well in the German-speaking territories\", and that strong sales persisted \"many months after\" its initial launch. He noted that it was catching up to the sales of DTP's most popular adventure release, \"\", which had sold 60,000 units in Germany and had earlier helped to revive the country's adventure game industry. \"The Black Mirror\" maintained its status as Germany's top-selling adventure of 2004 through the end of the year; Chris Kellner of DTP believed that the game's German sales surpassed is commercial performance anywhere else. Alongside \"\" and \"The Moment of Silence\", \"The Black Mirror\" contributed to DTP's large-scale growth during 2004.\n\n\"The Black Mirror\" went on to sell above 100,000 units in Germany alone. According to Future Games, global sales surpassed 500,000 units by late 2008.\n\nAccording to \"Gameswelt\", \"The Black Mirror\" received harsh reviews from critics in the United States. While most critics praised its dark atmosphere - created mostly by meticulously drawn backgrounds, music, ambiance and realistic animation and sound effects - the quality of the English voice-overs was unsatisfying to many. Other points of criticism include the game's rigid linear structure, pixel hunting elements, plot holes and inconsistencies (acts later revealed to have been committed by certain characters were not possible given their location at the time) and most especially the game's ending.\n\nIn 2011, Adventure Gamers named \"Black Mirror\" the 83rd-best adventure game ever released.\n\nGerman-based Cranberry Production developed a sequel, \"\", in 2009. It takes place in the 1990s, twelve years after the original game. When solitary Darren Michaels befriends the beautiful Angelina Morgan, he has no idea what the fates hold in store for him. The alluring Angelina has also attracted the eye of several others; and when she suddenly disappears, Darren finds himself questioning what has happened to her while he is haunted by a series of torturous and ever-intensifying nightmares. Darren's search for his missing friend and his own sanity take him on a chilling expedition from his small New England town to Willow Creek, England - and the reigning evil of Black Mirror Castle.\n\nDarren's journey will immerse him in the dark secrets and turbulent history of the castle's ill-fated Gordon Family. Legend has it that the Gordons were haunted by an ancient curse that ultimately led to their demise more than a decade earlier. Will Darren be able to overcome these demons and find Angelina? Will Darren's search lead him to redemption or the hell of insanity? Or will he become the curse's next victim?\n\nA second and final sequel by Cranberry Production, \"Black Mirror III\", was released in 2011. The story connects with the end of Black Mirror 2, and promises a deep, mysterious story, including two playable characters.\n\nKING Art Games and THQ Nordic are releasing Black Mirror; a modern re-imagining of the acclaimed Gothic-horror adventure series. New protagonist David Gordon never knew his estranged father particularly well. Still it comes as a shock when he is summoned to his family's ancestral home in the Scottish highlands, after his father has taken his own life there. David does not know much about his father's final weeks, but the circumstances of his death seem more than peculiar. Settling the heritage is merely an excuse for David to find out more about the castle his father grew up in, meeting the family he never knew and for shedding light on the mysteries surrounding his father's death. Scotland, 1926. Following the suicide of his father, David Gordon visits his ancestral home for the first time in his life. A life that is soon threatened by the dark secrets that claimed the sanity of many Gordons before him. Tormented by nightmares and waking dreams for all his life, David fears that it might be his destiny to follow in his father's footsteps, down a path that leads to madness, and death. Is there really a Curse that has been haunting his family, like his father believed? It is up to David to uncover the horrible truths, buried under generations of silence and fathoms of stone.

{"id": "311242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311242", "title": "The Dumb Waiter", "text": "The Dumb Waiter\n\nThe Dumb Waiter is a one-act play by Harold Pinter written in 1957.\n\n\"Small but perfectly formed, \"The Dumb Waiter\" might be considered the best of Harold Pinter's early plays, more consistent than \"The Birthday Party\" and sharper than \"The Caretaker\". It combines the classic characteristics of early Pinter – a paucity of information and an atmosphere of menace, working-class small-talk in a claustrophobic setting – with an oblique but palpable political edge and, in so doing, can be seen as containing the germ of Pinter's entire dramatic oeuvre\".\n\n\"\"The Dumb Waiter\" is Pinter distilled – the very essence of a writer who tapped into our desire to seek out meaning, confront injustice and assert our individuality.\"\n\nTwo hit-men, Ben and Gus, are waiting in a basement room for their assignment. As the play begins, Ben, the senior member of the team, is reading a newspaper, and Gus, the junior member, is tying his shoes. Gus asks Ben many questions as he gets ready for their job and tries to make tea. They argue over the semantics of \"light the kettle\" and \"put on the kettle\". Ben continues reading his paper for most of the time, occasionally reading excerpts of it to Gus. Ben gets increasingly animated, and Gus's questions become more pointed, at times nearly nonsensical.\n\nIn the back of the room is a dumbwaiter, which delivers occasional food orders. This is mysterious and both characters seem to be puzzled why these orders keep coming; the basement is clearly not outfitted as a restaurant kitchen. At one point they send up some snack food that Gus had brought along. Ben has to explain to the people above via the dumbwaiter's \"speaking tube\" that there is no food. \n\nGus leaves the room to get a drink of water in the bathroom, and the dumbwaiter's speaking tube whistles (a sign that there is a person on the other end who wishes to communicate). Ben listens carefully—we gather from his replies that their victim has arrived and is on his way to the room. Ben shouts for Gus, who is still out of the room. The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie and gun. There is a long silence as the two stare at each other before the curtain comes down.\n\nThe dumb waiter of the title refers to the serving hatch and food lift that delivers orders to the gunmen. It could also refer to Gus, who fails to realise that he is waiting to be the victim, or even to Ben, whose obedience to a higher authority eventually forces him to eliminate his partner.\n\nThe windowless basement is characteristic of Pinter's sets. \"Pinter's rooms are stuffy, non-specific cubes, whose atmosphere grows steadily more stale and more tense. At the opening curtain these rooms look naturalistic, meaning no more than the eye can contain. But, by the end of each play, they become sealed containers, virtual coffins.\"\n\nPinter's writing in \"The Dumb Waiter\" combines \"the staccato rhythms of music-hall cross-talk and the urban thriller\". The dialogue between Ben and Gus, while seemingly concerned only with trivial newspaper stories, football matches and cups of tea, reveals their characters. In Pinter's early plays, \"it is language that betrays the villains – more pat, more cliché-ridden, with more brute power than that of their victims\".\n\nIn the theatre, the emotional power of the play is more readily felt than understood. Pinter \"created his own theatrical grammar – he didn't merely write characters that had an emotional response to something... But instead, through his characters' interactions and phrasings, Pinter seemed to conjure the very visceral emotion itself\".\n\nAlthough the play is realistic in many ways, particularly the dialogue between Ben and Gus, there are also elements that are unexplained and seemingly absurd, particularly the messages delivered by the dumb waiter itself, and the delivery of an envelope containing twelve matchsticks. Pinter is notable for leaving the plays open to interpretation, \"wanting his audience to complete his plays, to resolve in their own ways these irresolvable matters\". Pinter stated that \"between my lack of biographical data about [the characters] and the ambiguity of what they say lies a territory which is not only worthy of exploration but which it is compulsory to explore\".\n\nOne interpretation is that the play is an absurdist comedy about two men waiting in a universe without meaning or purpose, like Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\". \"The Dumb Waiter... achieves, through its unique blend of absurdity, farce, and surface realism, a profoundly moving statement about the modern human condition\".\n\nAnother interpretation is that the play is a political drama showing how the individual is destroyed by a higher power. \"Each of Harold Pinter's [first] four plays ends in the virtual annihilation of an individual... It is by his bitter dramas of dehumanisation that he implies \"the importance of humanity\". The religion and society, which have traditionally structured human morality, are, in Pinter's plays, the immoral agents that destroy the individual.\" Pinter supported the interpretation of \"The Birthday Party\" and \"The Dumb Waiter\" as \"political plays about power and victimisation\".\n\nOverall, \"it makes much more sense if seen as a play about the dynamics of power and the nature of partnership. Ben and Gus are both victims of some unseen authority and a surrogate married couple quarrelling, testing, talking past each other and raking over old times\". It is \"a strongly political play about the way a hierarchical society, in pitting the rebel against the conformist, places both at its mercy\", but at the same time \"a deeply personal play about the destructiveness of betrayal\".\n\n\"For an audience to gaze into Ben and Gus' closed basement room and overhear their everyday prattle is to gain insight into ... the terrifying vision of the dominant-subservient battle for power, a battle in which societies and individuals engage as a part of daily existence\".\n\nAlthough the play uses \"the semantic nit-picking that is a standard part of music hall comedy\" and is generally considered funny, this is not comedy for its own sake, but \"a crucial part of the power-structure\".\n\n\"The comedy routines in the early plays are maps to the themes and meaning of the plays as a whole... Our failure to laugh may be an indication that we, the audience, have come to side (or have been taught to side) with the victim rather than the victimiser.\"\n\nThe stories Ben picks out from his newspaper have a similar purpose. He describes an old man, wanting to cross the street, who crawls under a lorry and is run over by it (but it is not clear if the man is killed or not). Ben seems to expect the response, \"What an idiot!\" but Gus replies \"Who advised him to do a thing like that?\" which shifts responsibility and suggests the old man was a victim to be pitied. \"The eventual split between Ben and Gus is foreshadowed in the very first joke...

{"id": "38361680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38361680", "title": "Theatre in Bangladesh", "text": "Theatre in Bangladesh\n\nTheatre in Bangladesh is believed to have its origin in the 4th century AD in the form of Sanskrit drama. The conquest of Bengal by the Gupta dynasty led the ingress of the northern Indian culture into the ancient Bangladeshi culture which eventually introduced the tradition of theatre in Bangladesh. At present, apart from the Sanskrit theatre, the influence of the European theatre and the indigenous folk culture can also be seen in the theatre art of Bangladesh.\n\nThrough the conquest of Bengal by the Guptas, the culture of ancient Bangladesh assimilated the Aryan culture of the northern India and got heavily influenced by it. At that time, theatre activities, which was in form of Sanskrit theatre, was generally practised by the urban folks. The vigorous trade by the local people led to the rise of some urban areas which were home to the art and cultural centre of ancient Bangladesh. \"Lokananda\" is believed to be a popular play from this period which was structured in four acts with a prologue and was written by Chandragomin.\n\nThe close political integration of many parts of ancient Bangladesh with the Aryan culture carried on through the 8th century. During this period, emperors like Bhaskaravarman, Yashovarman, Lalitaditya greatly influenced the Sanskrit theatre movement in the region. However, the theatre activities in this period witnessed the greatest patronage by Harshavardhana. According to the Kashmiri poet Kalhana, there was a great theatre dancer named Kamala in the ancient kingdom of Pundravardhana, now a part of northern Bangladesh. During the Pala rule (8th to 12th century), Bikrampur was the centre of a thriving Sanskrit theatre tradition in Bangladesh. This development of Sanskrit theatre also flourished during the Sena rule.\n\nThe tradition of Sanskrit theatre witnessed a major impediment through the arrival of Muslim rule in the early 13th century. Few theatre activities are recorded from this period which were mostly supported by some Hindu feudal lords. Lakshmana Manikya of Bhulua was a great patron of Sanskrit theatre of this period.\n\nThe term Folk theatre encompasses all forms of theatre which originated in the geographical region of Bangladesh. Unlike the Sanskrit theatre, the folk theatre was always in direct contact with the people and was often created and supported by them. However, it was not closed to the refined techniques of the Sanskrit theatre. In the folk theatre, the performers include actors, dancers, singers, musicians, and puppeteers (both male and female). Their performance is not restricted to dialogue in prose but is comprehensive and wide-ranging. It includes any one or more of the following elements: (i) dance, (ii) instrumental music and (iii) speech rendered in prose, verse or lyric, either in the form of narration or that of dialogue. The folk theatre of Bangladesh has developed in distinct forms, which can be loosely categorised into (i) the Narrative, (ii) the Song-and-Dance, (iii) the Processional, and (iv) the Supra-personae.\n\nIn the narrative forms of theatre, the lead-narrator (gayen) describes an event, portrays various characters related to the event and enacts the action, all in the third person. While engaged as described above, s/he partly speaks his/her lines in prose, partly recites in verse, and partly sings his/her story. S/he is assisted by the choral singers-cum-musicians (dohars), who employ musical instruments (Mridanga and Mandira) and sing choral passages. The gayen carries a chamar (whisk) in religious performances and occasionally dances while singing. Usually, the performer makes effective use of vocal inflections and physical gestures in his/her portrayal of the characters. Sometimes s/he also readjusts his/her basic costume, and uses a few props to make the portrayal more effective.\n\nA song-and-dance performance (nata-gita) is characterised by dances rendered by performers enacting characters while singing their lines or dancing silently to songs sung by a group of choral singers and musicians.\n\nThe masked dance of the Gombhira festival was originally an ancient shamanist or spirit cult performance of the Koch community. By the 9th century, the Tantric Buddhism in Bangladesh assimilated the performance to evolve their own forms of masked dance, which were similar to \"Astamatrika\" Dance, \"Mahakali Pyayakhan\", \"Devi Pyayakhan\" (Kathmandu, Nepal) and Tibetan Buddhist masked dances. These dances were performed in the Buddhist monasteries during religious festivals, very much as in Tibetan and Nepalese practice. These performances were given at the year-ending celebration of Chaitra Sangkranti and were given after processional performances.\n\nBy the end of the 12th century, when Tantric Saivism in Bangladesh had assimilated decaying Tantric Buddhism, Buddhist masked dances were also adapted to give rise to Mahakali Pyayakhan, Devi Pyayakhan and similar dances. Tantric Saivite masked dances in Bangladesh, unlike those of Kathmandu Valley (Nepal), decayed because of Muslim conquest. What remains today can be seen in \"Mukho Nacha\", \"Kali Kach\", Gambhira festival and \"Sang Jatra\".\n\nThe existence of patuya sangit (performances with scroll paintings) in ancient Bangladesh is confirmed by two sources: Yamapattika as referred to in Harshacharita (7th century AD) and scroll painting of the Santals. Banabhatta (the court-poet of Harsavardhan) in his Harshacharita briefly describes a popular performance of Yamapattaka witnessed by Harsavardhan on his way back to the capital after he learnt of the death of his brother. It was given by a performer with the help of a scroll-painting showing Yama, the King of the Underworld. On the other hand, recent ethnographic studies have shown that the Santal people have among them a type of scroll painting representing the origin of life (Ko Reyak Katha) and the passage of the dead from the mortal world to the life beyond (Chaksudan Pat). These too point to the ancient origin of Patuya Gan performances in Bangladesh. In the medieval period, scroll painting performances eulogising Ramachandra, Krishna, Manasa, Chandi were extremely popular. By the 18th century, scroll-painting performances gained popularity even among the Muslims, as evinced by Gazir Pat (scroll-painting performances eulogising Pir Gazi), which can still be seen in Bangladesh today.\n\nIt is not known when puppet theatre was introduced in Bangladesh. The earliest extant literary evidence of the existence of the form in Bangladesh is a couplet in Yusuf Zulekha (1391–1410). As signified there, these performances were given with the help of string puppets. It is possible that orally composed tales of gods and goddesses, such as those of Krishna, Rama, Manasa etc., were produced in these performances. Mukunda Chakravarti's Chandimangal (1555–56) and Krishnadasa Kaviraja's Chaitanya Charitamrita (c 1560–80) definitely point to the existence of puppet theatre during this period. Judging by the popularity of cults and the existing tradition among current performers, it could be safely assumed that these were related to Krishna, Rama, Manasa, Chandi and Chaitanya. No Islamic narrative ever seems to have been performed by puppets in Bangladesh. String puppets still exist in Bangladesh today.\n\nProcessional performances are characterised by the use of tableaux, music, song and dance, all of which form a part of large processions (jatra) attended by adherents of a particular religious faith. In many ways, these performances hold the key to the history of indigenous theatre because they brought together all the three types discussed above, to give birth to jatra, the most popular form of the indigenous theatre which can claim to be indeed the national theatre idiom.\n\nPolitical and economic measures undertaken by the English colonisers from 1757 onwards led to the Bengali renaissance in the early 19th century, which affected all aspects of intellectual pursuits in Bangladesh. Its immediate effect was a bifurcation of society into the rural and urban cultures. The elitist urban culture and the European theatre of the economically powerful minority fashioned itself around European models. It demonstrated tremendous vitality, opened new directions, but, as in most cases, also lost touch with the majority and their rural culture. The indigenous theatre, which in most cases remained a part of the rural culture, has failed to meet the demands of the 21st century life in Bangladesh and a process of fossilisation has already set in. On the other hand, the European theatre has been dynamic because the elite urban intelligentsia, who have been responding to the needs of urban spectators, have sustained it. Inception of the European theatre in Bangladesh or erstwhile East Bengal took place in 1855 with a performance of \"Svarna Sharnkhal\" by Durgadas Kar at Barisal.\n\nUntil 1947, the theatre of the urban elite in Bengal was centred in Calcutta, the economic and political seat of power of 19th century India. With the creation of Pakistan, Dhaka gained importance as the urban cultural centre of eastern Bengal which later turned into East Pakistan. The theatre of the new country was slowly but decisively moving towards polarisation of two opposing camps: (i) the religion-based nationalists and (ii) the language-based nationalists. The religion-based trend was dominant in the urban areas outside Dhaka. It sought to glorify Islamic history through historical plays on Muslim rulers of the Middle East, India and Bengal, and the independence struggle of Pakistan. Akbaruddin, Ibrahim Khan and Ibrahim Khalil are some of the most prominent playwrights of this trend. The second trend was dominant mainly in Dhaka city and playwrights belonging to this trend were also linked with Dhaka University-based play productions. This trend was pioneered by Natyaguru Nurul Momen. He wrote, published, directed, enacted, broadcast and staged the earliest couple of plays which were secular, non-communal, progressive and international in their themes and plots. The Natyaguru, Nurul Momen's first play 'Rupantor'(Transformation) was a 1942 play which propounded the cause of women's lib and empowerment at a time when even the western world wasn't vocal enough about equal rights for women. Some other important playwrights who followed Natyaguru Nurul Momen in this trend include Shawkat Osman, Askar Ibne Shaikh, Jasimuddin and Munier Chowdhury.\n\nTheatre was possibly the most forceful and exuberant expression of post-liberation Bangladesh. Numerous non-professional theatre groups were formed all over the country, modelled after the group theatre movement in post-Nabanna Calcutta. The most important among these in Dhaka city were \"Theatre\" (established February 1972), \"Nagarik Natya Sampraday\" (established 1968, first performance August 1972), \"Natyachakra\" (established August 1972), \"Aranyak Natyadal\" (established 1972), \"Dhaka Theatre\" (established July 1973) and, in Chittagong, \"Theatre '73\" (established 1973), and \"Arindam\" (established September 1974). The range of texts performed by the groups varied widely, from Euro-American plays to contemporary originals written by group members themselves. A completely new set of playwrights appeared, important among whom were Abdullah al Mamun, Mamunur Rashid, Syed Shamsul Huq, Selim Al Deen, Mumtazuddin Ahmed, S M Solaiman, Abdullahel Mahmud, Mannan Heera, Azad Abul Kalam and Saymon Zakaria.\n\nThe culture of theatre has great significance in the history as well as the daily lives of Bangladeshis. The theatre performances had vehemently inspired the independence movements during the British rule in Bangladesh. It also had great impact in the Bengali language movement. The language-based nationalists during the East Pakistan period played an important role in this regard. \"Kabar\" written by Munier Chowdhury is a famous play based on the language movement. The theatre performances also significantly influenced the independence struggle of Bangladesh. At present, many NGOs use theatre as a forceful medium to create awareness for many social issues in the rural areas of Bangladesh.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2859373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2859373", "title": "Ursa (DC Comics)", "text": "Ursa (DC Comics)\n\nUrsa is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. She first appeared in the 1978 film \"Superman: The Movie\" portrayed by actress Sarah Douglas. The character made her comic book debut in \"Action Comics\" #845 (January 2007). An adversary of the superhero Superman and accomplice of General Zod, she is typically depicted as having been imprisoned in the Phantom Zone along with Zod and Non.\n\nUrsa is depicted in both films as a hater of any member of the male gender anywhere. The only exceptions to this prejudice appear to be Non and General Zod. In the first film, this aspect of her character is emphasized by Jor-El in his speech as he sentences them to the Phantom Zone. In the second film, as directed by Richard Lester, Ursa's male hating tendencies survive, but the reprise of Jor-El's speech emphasizes a different aspect of her character. In Lester's \"Superman II\", Jor-El says \"Ursa, the only feeling you showed was for your vicious general. Your only wish, to rule at his side.\" Lester's inclusion of this material (shot by Donner) alters the character slightly, making her softer and, at least to a degree, in love with General Zod. In \"Superman II\" footage shot by Richard Donner, Ursa is more vicious and expresses her desire to kill as many men as she can in one scene from an extended TV version. During the moon scene, Ursa meets an astronaut. Ursa tears off his NASA patch, killing him. She then kicks him between the legs, sending him off into space. This one scene showcases how cruel and powerful Ursa is. In Donner's footage, Ursa does not necessarily appear to be in love with General Zod, but is with him because they share common goals.\n\nIf there is one female whom she truly despises, it is Lois Lane. This is likely because of her close relationship with Superman, the only real threat to Ursa and the trio's reign of terror on Earth.\n\nThroughout \"Superman II\", Ursa collects symbols and badges as she encounters law enforcement and military officers on Earth, and she keeps these badges on her costume as symbols of those she has conquered or killed. She takes a NASA patch from an astronaut, a Sheriff's badge, a badge from a military officer's uniform at the White House, and several more badges and symbols that can be seen attached to her uniform as the film progresses.\n\nIn Kevin J. Anderson's \"Last Days Of Krypton\" novel, the character of Aethryr is analogous to Ursa in appearance and role as sidekick to Zod, although little mention is made about her attitude towards males.\n\nUntil 2006, the character of Ursa had never appeared in the \"Superman\" comic books, but a similar character, named Faora, made several appearances in the Pre-Crisis \"Superman\" comics. Faora was a Phantom Zone villain who first appeared in \"Action Comics\" #471 (May, 1977). Like Ursa, Faora hates all members of the male sex and was in fact sentenced to the Phantom Zone for \"wantonly causing the death of 23 Kryptonian men in her own male concentration camp.\"\n\nIn \"JSA Classified\" #3, Power Girl (who was unsure about her true origins, at the time) was confronted by an escaped prisoner, from the Phantom Zone. He claimed that Power Girl's true identity, is Ursa, who had escaped the Zone with their help and promised to help the others escape. However, the prisoner was later revealed to be an illusion, created by the Psycho-Pirate.\n\n\"Action Comics\" #845 (January 2007), which is the second part of the \"Last Son\" arc by Geoff Johns & Richard Donner, finally introduced Ursa to the \"Superman\" comic book canon. This version of her contains elements similar to the originally released version of Superman II (even though Donner is co-writing this arc) where she is in love with Zod. Zod and Ursa are the parents of the Kryptonian boy that Superman and Lois Lane adopted.\n\nIn a flashback in Action Comic Annual #10 a fleshed out retelling of the story told in Superman II partly aligned her story to her movie counterpart. Lover of General Zod, and part of the Kryptonian guard, she believed that Non and Jor-El were right about Krypton's final fate, and sought to rebel against the Council. When Non was kidnapped, lobotomized and turned into a brute with minimal intelligence and unable to speak, Zod and Ursa snapped, instigating open rebellion, while Jor-El surrendered to the Council, eventually using the Phantom Zone projector upon the trio during the trial seen in at has been the movie. Ursa stayed loyal to Zod, even in their \"exile\", and believing that Jor-El should have been able to save Krypton, or at least his lineage, agreed with Zod in pursuing and taking vengeance over the House of El.\n\nUrsa appears in another flashback alongside Zod in Action Comics #866. Here, she and Zod encounter Brainiac, who shrinks Kandor. During this encounter Brainiac killed the whole unit under Ursa's command. This paralyzes her with fear, changes her into the more vindictive person she is now. She runs a Black Ops squad that has been living on earth in secret. After Zod's attack on New Krypton she seem to be unable focus on her work and goes to Zod's side. Superman and even Non, lobotomized, seem to know her pain and seems to want to comfort her at this time. She is along with Superman or Commander El and Commander Gor now the leader of the Kryptonian military.\n\nDespite her initial, brief joy in motherhood, she still shows the brunt of her misandric belief on her son, Lor-Zod, who was abused on a regular basis on the account of his perceived weakness (due to his conception in the Phantom Zone, Lor ages in uncontrollable \"grow spurts\" and exhibits weaker powers than the rest of his race under a yellow sun). As a result, Ursa is now completely estranged from Lor, who arrived on Earth and was raised as Chris Kent—the foster son of Clark Kent and his wife Lois Lane. Chris, upon returning to Earth one more time, openly defied his own legacy, mercilessly beating Ursa to save Thara Ak-Var, his current paramour. Ursa no longer considers Chris part of her family, and still resents Lois Lane for her bond with her estranged son.\n\nThis version has developed a weakness to bright light and wears goggles. This apparently came about as a side-effect of being imprisoned in the Phantom Zone repeatedly.\n\nFollowing \"DC Rebirth\", Ursa has been reintroduced in the new continuity as Zod's wife, along with their son Lor-Zod. After joining Henshaw's Superman Revenge Squad and making believe them to free his army, General Zod used the Phantom Zone projector to free them. Along with the Eradicator II, they fled to another planet, planning to create a New Krypton.\n\nAs a Kryptonian, Ursa derives her superhuman abilities from the yellow sun of Earth's solar system. Her basic abilities are high levels of superhuman strength, superhuman speed and superhuman stamina sufficient to bend steel in her bare hands, overpower a locomotive, outrun a speeding bullet and leap over a tall building in a single bound as well as heightened senses of hearing and sight including X-ray vision as well as telescopic and microscopic visions; virtual invulnerability; accelerated healing; longevity; heat vision; powerful freezing breath; and flight. Being female, her power levels are more akin to Supergirl and Wonder Woman.\n\nSimilar to other Phantom Zone escapees, Ursa typically never experiences the full measure of her abilities as she is never given enough time to absorb and metabolite the yellow solar energy of Earth's sun before she is defeated and banished back to the Zone. As such, Ursa could prove more powerful than even Supergirl and possibly Wonder Woman as well due to her being a fully matured Kryptonian female while Supergirl is a later adolescent Kryptonian female and Wonder Woman is an Amazon. Her full strength would also make her a sufficient threat to Superman due to her combat prowess.\n\nBeyond just her superhuman strength and experienced hand-to-hand combat skills, Ursa is a ruthless killer who will do anything immoral to achieve her ends. She is fiercely loyal to General Zod and is willing to fight and die for his loyalty. Ursa is also a radical feminist with an extreme sociopathic hatred of males with the only apparent exception being General Zod and her Phantom Zone cohorts. This sentiment seems to extend to a lesser degree to her own son, Lor-Zod, as she willingly and gleefully stood by while Zod violently and physically abused the young boy.\n\nLike all Kryptonians, Ursa is vulnerable to Kryptonite and red solar radiation. Her virtual invulnerability does not provide protection from mind control or magic and can be overpowered and cause her to experience significant and even fatal injuries with significant force such as that of several atomic explosions or strikes from an opponent with superior strength and durability such as Doomsday. Her superhuman strength is inferior to the likes of Doomsday and her superhuman speed is inferior to Speedsters like the Flash. Her superhuman strength is limited due to her natural limits even while within the empowering light of Sol.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated from Leigh High School, Stanford University with a B.A. in Political Science in 1993, and Harvard Law School in 1996.\n\nFluent in Mandarin Chinese, he is the eldest of three children born to immigrant parents from Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nJih's father came to the U.S. as a full scholarship student at The University of California, Berkeley. After receiving his Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering, Dr. Jih began his career in IBM as a Staff Engineer and rose to become an Account Executive for marketing & sales of IT solution services to the semiconductor industry. In 1997, Jih's parents returned to their home to further their career.\n\nJih currently resides in Los Angeles, California.\n\nOn October 20, 2013 Victor participated in The Amazing Los Angeles Race Disneyland edition.\n\nVictor and his sister, Tammy, were selected for the race after she had pushed for them to apply, although he had been the longer fan of the show. According to Victor, the siblings had led a very structured life growing up. Their parents taught them to do everything to the best of their ability and to obey all rules in an orderly manner. As a result, the siblings studied hard at school, obtained good grades, and graduated from the world's top universities with law degrees. Even after graduation, they took no break and immediately ventured into the workforce. It was because of such a structured upbringing and the fact that both of them had not taken any major risks in life that made them decide to apply for the show. They wanted to step outside of their normal routine as lawyers and take an adventure of a lifetime. After twelve grueling legs spanning 40,000 miles, they were declared the winners of the \"race\" after narrowly avoiding elimination during the third leg in Romania. As a result, they made history by becoming the first Asian-American team to win the competition. Jih has written blogs and commentaries for further seasons of the show.\n\nA writer for the Chinese language newspaper, World Journal, based in North America, praised the team as \"Glory of Taiwan\", \"famous product of Taiwan\" 台灣之光 台灣名產 for representing Taiwanese Americans in the media spotlight. They were portrayed as humble, gracious and friendly, but also extremely competitive.\n\nAs three legs of the second half of the race were spent in China, where the siblings could speak the local language, a blogger for the Chicago Sun Times and many detractors questioned whether the team had an unfair advantage. Both of them disagreed and Victor explained that every team brings to the game different skills and strengths, and their ability to speak Mandarin balances out against other teams' advantages e.g. choreography, athleticism, swimming, physical strength, life experiences, et cetera. They explained how their mother would fight with them to get them to attend Chinese school and force them to speak the language at home. Both were extremely thankful for their parents' good intentions and not giving up on them when they were young. In previous seasons of the race, there were also teams that spoke the local language of the countries they visited.\n\nJih was a partner at the Century City office of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, specializing in entertainment and media litigation until May 2015. Now, he is a partner at the Los Angeles office of Irell & Manella.\n\nAn avid debater since high school, Jih holds the position of debate coach at Brentwood School, and is the founder of Victory Briefs, a high school debate company, which he sold in 2014.\n\nHe currently co-teaches the Ninth Circuit Appellate Practice Clinic at UCLA.\n"}
{"id": "7251551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7251551", "title": "Wakefield Mystery Plays", "text": "Wakefield Mystery Plays\n\nThe Wakefield or Towneley Mystery Plays are a series of thirty-two mystery plays based on the Bible most likely performed around the Feast of Corpus Christi probably in the town of Wakefield, England during the late Middle Ages until 1576. It is one of only four surviving English mystery play cycles. Some scholars argue that the Wakefield cycle is not a cycle at all, but a mid-sixteenth-century compilation, formed by a scribe bringing together three separate groups of plays.\n\nThe unique manuscript, now housed at the Huntington Library, San Marino, California, originated in the mid-fifteenth century. The Towneley family who lent their name to the manuscript, sold it at an auction in 1814, but it was probably part of their library at a much earlier date. Although almost the entire manuscript is in a fifteenth-century hand, the cycle was performed as early as the fourteenth century in an earlier form.\n\nThe Wakefield Cycle is most renowned for the inclusion of \"The Second Shepherds' Play\", one of the jewels of medieval theatre.\n\nTheatre Royal Wakefield, (formerly Wakefield Theatre Royal & Opera House) produced a modern-day version of the plays in Wakefield Cathedral with a young community cast from 11–20 August 2016\n\nThe cycle is the work of many authors, some sourced from the York Cycle. However, the most significant contribution has been attributed to an anonymous author known as the \"Wakefield Master.\" It is believed that his additions include \"Noah, The First Shepherds' Play, The Second Shepherds' Play, Herod the Great and The Buffeting of Christ.\" This common authorship is suspected due to a unique thirteen-line rhymed stanza, which is evident in all five texts.\n\nThe term \"Wakefield Master\" emerged from a need to distinguish some material in the Towneley manuscript from a mass of unexceptional material, and was first coined by Charles Mills Gayley. In 1903, Gayley and Alwin Thaler published an anthology of criticism and dramatic selections entitled \"Representative English Comedies\". It had long been believed that the Towneley Play was a mediocre work that showed extensive borrowing from other sources but containing vibrant and exciting material, apparently by one author, who was responsible for four or five complete pageants and extensive revisions. Gayley refers to this person as the \"master\" (with a lowercase \"m\") in the book. Then in a 1907 article, Gayley emended this to \"The Wakefield Master,\" the name which is still frequently used.\n\nWithin the Broadview Anthology of Medieval Drama, Christina M. Fitzgerald and John T. Sebastian find it important to note, \"the quotation marks placed around the name 'Wakefield Master' are thus to be taken to indicate that the ascription of authorship is the product of convention, rather than proven fact. All that can be said with confidence is that there seems clearly to have been a common force involved in the shaping of all five of these plays.\"\n\nThe most obvious of these characteristics is that several of the pageants use a distinctive stanza, sometimes called the Wakefield Stanza (see below). The pageants that manifest the Wakefield Stanza are noted for comedy, social satire, and intense psychological realism. These qualities also show up throughout the Towneley Cycle, most often where it seems to depart from its presumed sources.\n\nSome question the existence of one \"Wakefield Master\", and propose that multiple authors could have written in the Wakefield Stanza. Barbara Palmer suggests that the story of the Wakefield Master and the suggestion that the Second Shepherd's Play was performed as part of the Wakefield Cycle were both inventions of an amateur historian named J. M. W. Walker. However, scholars and literary critics find it useful to hypothesize a single talent behind them, due to the unique poetic qualities of the works ascribed to him.\n\nThere is widespread disagreement among scholars concerning the staging of the Wakefield Cycle, and of mystery plays in general. It is known that the cycle at York was staged on wagons that moved from place to place in the city, with multiple plays staged simultaneously in different locales in the city. However, there is disagreement as to whether the Wakefield plays were performed in a similar manner.\n\nOne problem is the population of Wakefield in 1377, which is approximately the date of the first performance of the plays. It consisted of 567 people aged sixteen or older. Assuming that half were male, that leaves only about 280 men to play the 243 roles in the plays. This leaves many to believe that multiple plays were performed by the same cast during most of the lifetime of the cycle.\n\nAnother way in which the Wakefield cycle differed in its staging from other cycles is that lack of association with the guilds. In other towns York and Coventry certain plays were staged by different guilds, according to their specialty (such as the shipwrights staging the Noah play). Although the names of four guilds are found on the manuscript (the barkers, glovers, litsters, and fishers), they are found in a later hand than most of the manuscript. This has led some to believe that for its entire lifetime, the Wakefield Cycle was sponsored and produced by other associations, either governmental or religious. Either way, it was surely performed by non-professional actors from the community, as were all the cycles.\n\nThe most notable poetic innovation in the manuscript is called the Wakefield Stanza, which is found in the Noah play, the two shepherds' plays, the Herod play, and the Buffeting of Christ pageant. This unique characteristic may be described as:\n\na nine-line stanza containing one quatrain with internal rhyme and a tail-rhymed cauda, rhyming AAAABCCCB; or, a thirteen-line stanza containing a cross-rhymed octet frons, a tercet cauda with tail-rhymes, the whole rhyming ABABABABCDDDC.\n\nThe former description was based upon the earliest editions of the play that reflected the space-saving habits of the medieval scribe, who often wrote two verse-lines on a single manuscript line. Thus, depending upon how one interprets the manuscript, a stanza (from the Noah pageant) might appear in either of the following forms:\n\nIn the first case above, the first four lines contain internal rhyme (i.e., \"prufe,\" \"hufe,\" \"hufe,\" and \"grufe\"); but the second example arranges the same verses in shorter lines, which in the manuscript are separated from one another by apparently random use of the obelus (÷), virgules [/], double-virgules[//], and line-breaks. In the second example, it is readily seen that the poet uses a cross-rhymed octet frons with a five-line tail-rhymed cauda. It is this innovative use of the cauda that is most distinctive in the stanza.\n\nThere is some disagreement over whether the Wakefield Stanza is nine or thirteen lines long. Owing largely to A.C.Cawley's 1957 edition of five of the pageants, and to others' arrangement of the manuscript lines, this is sometimes thought to be a nine-line stanza, with the quatrain containing internal rhyme. This view predominated in the critical literature until the late twentieth century, and has fallen out of favor. When Cawley himself edited the entire cycle with Martin Stevens for publication in 1994, the two opted to present the lines as a thirteen-line stanza. In any case, the number of syllables in the lines is variable, and the number of stressed syllables can usually be counted at two or three per line in the thirteen-line version.\n\nSince the Towneley Play was a drama and therefore spoken rather than read silently, to some degree this presentation of the poetic units in graphical form is somewhat arbitrary and inconsequential. But it does provide insights into the poetic influences and innovations of the Wakefield Master.\n\nIn 1576, the Wakefield plays were altered by the Protestant authorities, before being discontinued completely. \"In that year, the Diocesan Court of High Commission at York revealed their attitude to the citizens of Wakefield in no uncertain terms. Permission was granted for the performance of their Cycle provided that:\n\n'In the said play no pageant be used or set further wherein the Ma(jest) ye of God the Father, God the Sonne, or God the Holie Goste or the administration of either the Sacrementes of baptism or of the Lordes Supper be counterfeited or represented, or anything plaid which tend to the maintenance of superstition and idolatry or which be contrary to the laws of God or of the realm.'\" (Kyng Johan, Lines 413-15)\n\nSuch strictures are a Protestant form of the aniconism in Judaism, the forbidding of any depiction of God or other supernatural beings, such as angels or demons.\n\nIn addition, alterations were sometimes made in the scripts to reflect Reformed doctrine. For example, the play involving John the Baptist was altered to conform to Protestant doctrines about the sacraments. The word \"pope\" was excised from \"Herod the Great,\" and twelve leaves are completely missing, which scholars suspect contained plays about the death, Assumption, and coronation as Queen of Heaven of the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe majority of the plays that make up the Wakefield Cycle are based (some rather tenuously) on the Bible, while the others are taken from either Roman Catholic or folk tradition.\n\n\nWhen the Andrew Lloyd Webber–Tim Rice musical \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" was in its infancy in 1972, it was so short that productions needed an added preamble to create a valid showpiece. Frank Dunlop, in the first British theatrical performances of the musical on stage, preceded his Young Vic productions of \"Joseph\" with his own adaptation of the first six Wakefield Mystery Plays, which were credited in the programme. The entire production was a double bill called \"Bible One: Two Looks at the Book of Genesis\". Part I, entitled \"The Creation to Jacob\" (or \"Mediaevel Mystery Plays\"), was Dunlop's reworking of the first six Wakefield plays, with music by Alan Doggett. Part II was \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\".\n\n\nRose, Martial. (1963). \"An Introduction to the Wakefield Plays,\" in \"The Wakefield Mystery Plays,\" Anchor Books.\n\n"}

The World Robot Olympiad competition uses Lego Mindstorms manufactured by LEGO Education. First held in 2004 in Singapore, it now attracts more than 20,000 teams from nearly 60 countries.\n\nThe competition consists of 4 different categories, Regular, College, Open and Soccer and for the Regular and Open categories, it consists of three different age groups: Elementary, Junior High and Senior High. Participants below the age of 13 are considered as Elementary, participants from ages 13 until 16 years old are considered Junior High and participants between 17–19 are considered Senior High. Participants can also compete outside their age group, but they must be younger than the specified age range and must partner up with someone in that age range. For example, a 12-year-old participant can join the Junior High sub-category only if teamed up with someone between 14 and 16.\n\nWRO was formally established in 2003, with the first international WRO final being organized in 2004. Organizations from China, Japan, Singapore and Korea are considered the founding countries. In 2004 teams from China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Russia, Singapore and Thailand took part in the first international final, held in Singapore.\n\nIn 2003 the four founding countries established the international WRO Committee (now known as the WRO Advisory Council), which decided to establish a new and permanent robotics organisation, based on the idea that students from all over the world should have the opportunity to meet with other students to fulfil the new mission statement:\n\n\"To bring together young people all over the world to develop their creativity, design & problem solving skills through challenging & educational robot competitions and activities\"\n\nThe WRO Committee decided on the new name World Robot Olympiad, and new WRO logos were developed.\n\nFinally the WRO Statutes and a set of General Rules were worked out to ensure a sound and safe future for WRO. One of the major decisions, which appears in the Statutes, was that the international WRO event should be hosted by a new country each year and the WRO Committee should elect a chairman.\n\nIn 2017, the host country of WRO was Costa Rica. This was the first time the competition was held outside the Asia Region and the first time it came to the Americas.\n\nAt WRO, challenging competitions are offered for everyone in the age from 6 – 25. WRO have four competition categories, with their own characteristics and challenges:\nEach season the challenges and theme for the Regular and Open Category are developed with the country that hosts the International Final. The WRO Football rules and the Advanced Robotics Challenge game are designed together with experts in the robotic sciences community.\n\nTeams must create a robot which can complete a specified mission determined by the organiser and usually based on the Open Category theme. Before the competition begins, the robot must be fully dismantled: for example, the batteries must be taken out of the brick or the tyres must be taken out from the wheels. It must be built in a specified time (150 minutes) before the first qualification round begins. If a team finishes building their robot before the 150 minutes finish, the team can practice on the competition fields. Each robot is restricted to be before the round begins, and may consist of only LEGO certified parts, with specified motors and sensors depending on each competition. It must finish the mission autonomously, within a maximum time of two minutes. Teams are judged on their scores. If two teams' scores are equal, they are judged by their time to the nearest millisecond.\n\n\nThe Open Category is a project based competition. Students create their own intelligent robotics solution relating to the current theme of the season. Teams will present their project and their robot model to a group of judges on the competition day.\n\n\nWith WRO Football is introduced a fun and exciting game with teams of two autonomous robots playing football (soccer). Every year little changes are introduced for the game to motivate the students to keep on developing their robots.\n\n\nThe Advanced Robotics Challenge (ARC) is the newest category. The games are designed to test older and more experienced student's engineering and programming skills to the limit.\n\nTeams compete on a set challenge. Robots may be pre-built and may use certain TETRIX and MATRIX elements. Teams may use either one MyRIO or KNR controller, or two EV3/NXT controllers; there are no restrictions on choice and number of sensors, motors and servos. The size of the robot before it begins must be within . The maximum time differs depending on each competition.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016 it ran a Bowling game and in the 2017 season it was introduced the Tetrastack challenge.\n\n\nAs the missions of the Regular, WRO Football and College Category get tougher and more teams in the Open Category are willing to present more creative-looking robots, organisers have to make changes to the list of eligible sensors, motors and bricks to be used in the competition. Initially only RCX bricks, motors and sensors were allowed. In the 2007 competition NXT bricks, motors and sensors were allowed as well. In 2011 the NXT colour sensor was added; in 2012, the HiTechnic colour sensor. In 2013 an EV3 robot was exhibited that used all four motors. In 2014, however, EV3 bricks, motors and sensors were allowed, but the number of motor ports was limited to three, and the EV3 Gyro sensor was not allowed. The 2015 competition allowed four motor ports and the gyro sensor, but not RCX bricks, motors, or sensors.\n\nThere are also a few changes to the number of categories. The earlier versions of this competition, before 2006, consists of only Regular and Open and that further sub-divides to only two age groups, Primary and High School.\n\nWRO have the ambition of being relevant to students of different ages. That is why it is offer competitions on platforms that provide fun and challenging experiences.\n\nIt is also why it have decided two of the categories into three age groups. In the Regular Category, each age group has a different mission. In the Open Category, the challenge is the same for all participants, but they are judged within their age group.\n\nPlease note:\n\n\"The mentioned ages reflect the age of the participant in the year of the competition, not at the competition day. For participation in the international WRO final it is strictly enforced that students cannot, at any time in the year of the competition, be older than specified in the age group definitions. Example: A participant that is still 12 years old at the time of the international WRO final in November, but turns 13 years old in December the same year cannot participate in Elementary Category.\"\n\nOnly teams that participated in a national competition in one of our member countries can qualify for the international final. The WRO Table of Eligibility (TOE) defines how many teams a WRO National Organizer can register for the international final.\n\nPrevious host countries are \"italicised\" while future host countries are bolded. Countries which are both previous and future hosts will have an asterisks (*).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47356548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47356548", "title": "World Wide What?", "text": "World Wide What?\n\nWorld Wide What? is a 2015 British film written, directed and filmed by Adam Townsend and Andy Trace of Cavalier, and produced by Poppy Gaye of Founders Forum. The film shows a parallel universe in which Tim Berners-Lee failed to invent the World Wide Web and the subsequent impact that would have on the lives of high-profile tech entrepreneurs. The film is narrated by Stephen Fry and includes cameos from Jimmy Wales, Arianna Huffington, Sean Parker, Tim Berners-Lee, Reid Hoffman, Michael Bloomberg, Michael Acton Smith, Martha Lane Fox, Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho, Brent Hoberman, and Steve Case.\n\nThe film begins in 1989 at the offices of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, also known as CERN, where Tim Berners Lee is working on his aspirations for the World Wide Web. He reflects to himself in private that this project could go on to promote \"world peace\" and also help people \"share pictures of kittens\". Upon leaving his office, Stephen Fry describes how a short-sighted assistant could have changed the course of humanity if she had accidentally put Tim Berners Lee's research in a waste paper basket. The film then goes on to depict a succession of sketches played out by global tech entrepreneurs in which they are forced to carry out analogue versions of their digital jobs. In order of appearance:\n\n\nThe film then returns to CERN to find Tim Berners Lee desperately looking for his research for creating the World Wide Web. As he becomes more and more distressed, his assistant walks through the door holding the papers stating that she had read them overnight. When Tim Berners Lee asks her if she thinks the research stands a chance in working, she ponders \"50/50\", much to his disappointment.\n\nThe film was funded by YouTube and King, with Jimmy Wales as executive producer. The script was written by filmmaker Adam Townsend of Cavalier, at the time with Freud Communications after the initial concept was developed by Jimmy Wales and Founders Forum. The scenes were filmed in London, Los Angeles, New York, Washington and Suffolk. The scenes that took place in America were directed by Declan Masterson.\n"}
