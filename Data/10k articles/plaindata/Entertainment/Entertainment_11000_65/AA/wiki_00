{"id": "39174513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39174513", "title": "Anhemitonic scale", "text": "Anhemitonic scale\n\nMusicology commonly classifies scales as either hemitonic or anhemitonic. Hemitonic scales contain one or more semitones, while anhemitonic scales do not contain semitones. For example, in traditional Japanese music, the anhemitonic \"yo\" scale is contrasted with the hemitonic \"in\" scale. The simplest and most commonly used scale in the world is the atritonic anhemitonic \"major\" pentatonic scale. The whole tone scale is also anhemitonic.\n\nA special subclass of the hemitonic scales is the cohemitonic scales. Cohemitonic scales contain two or more semitones (making them hemitonic) such that two or more of the semitones appear consecutively in scale order. For example, the Hungarian minor scale in C includes F, G, and A in that order, with a semitone between F and G, and then a semitone between G and A.\n\nAncohemitonic scales, in contrast, either contain no semitones (and thus are anhemitonic), or contain semitones (being hemitonic) where none of the semitones appear consecutively in scale order. Some authors, however, do not include anhemitonic scales in their definition of ancohemitonic scales. Examples of ancohemitonic scales are numerous, as ancohemitonia is favored over cohemitonia in the world's musics: diatonic scale, melodic major/melodic minor, Hungarian major scale, harmonic major scale, harmonic minor scale, and the so-called octatonic scale.\n\nHemitonia is also quantified by the number of semitones present. Unhemitonic scales have only one semitone; dihemitonic scales have 2 semitones; trihemitonic scales have 3 semitones, etc. In the same way that an anhemitonic scale is less dissonant than a hemitonic scale, an unhemitonic scale is less dissonant than a dihemitonic scale.\n\nThe qualification of cohemitonia versus ancohemitonia combines with the cardinality of semitones, giving terms like: dicohemitonic, triancohemitonic, and so forth. An ancohemitonic scale is less dissonant than a cohemitonic scale, the count of their semitones being equal. In general, the number of semitones is more important to the perception of dissonance than the adjacency (or lack thereof) of any pair of them. Additional adjacency between semitones (once adjacency is present) does not necessarily increase the dissonance, the count of semitones again being equal.\n\nRelated to these semitone classifications are tritonic and atritonic scales. Tritonic scales contain one or more tritones, while atritonic scales do not contain tritones. A special monotonic relationship exists between semitones and tritones as scales are built by projection, q.v. below.\n\nThe harmonic relationship of all these categories comes from the perception that semitones and tritones are the severest of dissonances, and that avoiding them is often desirable. The most-used scales across the planet are anhemitonic. Of the remaining hemitonic scales, the ones most used are ancohemitonic.\n\nMost of the world's music is anhemitonic, perhaps 90%. Of that other hemitonic portion, perhaps 90% is unhemitonic, predominating in chords of only 1 semitone, all of which are ancohemitonic by definition. Of the remaining 10%, perhaps 90% are dihemitonic, predominating in chords of no more than 2 semitones. The same applies to chords of 3 semitones. In both later cases, however, there is a distinct preference for ancohemitonia, as the lack of adjacency of any two semitones goes a long way towards softening the increasing dissonance.\n\nThe following table plots sonority size (downwards on the left) against semitone count (to the right) plus the quality of ancohemitonia (denoted with letter A) versus cohemitonia (denoted with letter C). In general, ancohemitonic combinations are fewer for a given chord or scale size, but used much more frequently so that their names are well known.\n\nColumn \"0\" represents the most commonly used chords., avoiding intervals of M7 and chromatic 9ths and such combinations of 4th, chromatic 5ths, and 6th to produce semitones. Column 1 represents chords that barely use the harmonic degrees that column \"0\" avoids. Column 2, however, represents sounds far more intractable.\n\nColumn 0, row 5 are the full but pleasant chords: 9th, 6/9, and 9alt5 with no 7. Column \"0\", row \"6\", is the unique whole tone scale. Column \"2A\", row \"7\", a local minimum, refers to the diatonic scale and melodic major/melodic minor scales. Ancohemitonia, inter alii, probably makes these scales popular. Column \"2C\", row \"7\", another local minimum, refers to the Neapolitan major scale, which is cohemitonic and somewhat less common but still popular enough to bear a name. Column \"3A\", row \"7\", another local minimum, represents the Hungarian major scale, and its involution, and the harmonic major scale and involution harmonic minor scale of the same. Column \"3A\", row \"6\", are the hexatonic analogs to these four familiar scales, one of which being the Augmented scale, and another the analog of the Octatonic scale - which itself appears, alone and solitary, at Column \">=4A\". row \"8\". Column \"2A\", row \"4\", another minimum, represents a few frankly dissonant, yet strangely \"resonant\" harmonic combinations: mM9 with no 5, 119, dom139, and M711.\n\nAs music tends towards increasing dissonance through history, perhaps someday Column 2 will be as acceptable as even Column 1 might be, and Column 3 will finally have a place in the harmony of the world.\n\nNote, too, that in the highest cardinality row for each column before the terminal zeros begin, the sonority counts are small, except for row \"7\" and the \"3\" columns of all sorts. This explosion of hemitonic possibility associated with note cardinality 7 (and above) possibly marks the lower bound for the entity called \"scale\" (in contrast to \"chord\").\n\nAs shown in the table, anhemitonia is a property of the domain of note sets cardinality 2 through 6, while ancohemitonia is a property of the domain of note sets cardinality 4 through 8 (3 through 8 for improper ancohemitonia including unhemitonia as well). This places anhemitonia generally in the range of \"chords\" and ancohemitonia generally in the range of \"scales\".\n\nThe interrelationship of semitones, tritones, and increasing note count can be demonstrated by taking five consecutive pitches from the circle of fifths; starting on C, these are C, G, D, A, and E. Transposing the pitches to fit into one octave rearranges the pitches into the major pentatonic scale: C, D, E, G, A. This scale is anhemitonic, having no semitones; it is atritonic, having no tritones.\n\nIn addition, this is the maximal number of notes taken consecutively from the circle of fifths for which is it still possible to avoid a semitone.\n\nAdding another note from the circle of fifths gives the major hexatonic scale: C D E G A B. This scale is hemitonic, having a semitone between B and C; it is atritonic, having no tritones. In addition, this is the maximal number of notes taken consecutively from the circle of fifths for which is it still possible to avoid a tritone.\n\nAdding still another note from the circle of fifths gives the major heptatonic scale: C D E F G A B (when the fifth is added from below the tonic). This scale is strictly ancohemitonic, having 2 semitones but not consecutively; it is tritonic, having a tritone between F and B. Past this point in the projection series, no new intervals are added to the Interval vector analysis of the scale, but cohemitonia results.\n\nAdding still another note from the circle of fifths gives the major octatonic scale: C D E F F G A B (when the fifth is added from above the top note in the series--B in this case). This scale is cohemitonic, having 3 semitones together at E F F G, and tritonic as well.\n\nSimilar behavior is seen across all scales generally, that more notes in a scale tend cumulatively to add dissonant intervals (specifically: hemitonia and tritonia in no particular order) and cohemitonia not already present. While also true that more notes in a scale tend to allow more and varied intervals in the interval vector, there might be said to be a \"point of diminishing returns\", when qualified against the also increasing dissonance, hemitonia, tritonia and cohemitonia. It is near these points where most popular scales lie.\n\nThough less used than ancohemitonic scales, the cohemitonic scales have an interesting property. The sequence of two (or more) consecutive halfsteps in a scale presents the opportunity to \"split\" the scale by placing the tonic note of the scale on the middle note of the halfstep span. This allows a leading tone from below resolving upwards, as well as a descending flat-supertonic upper neighbor, both converging on the tonic. The split turns a weakness - dissonance of cohemitonia - to a strength: contrapuntal convergence on the tonic. It is very common that a cohemitonic (or even hemitonic) scale (e.g.: Hungarian minor { C D E F G A B }) be displaced preferentially to a mode where the halfstep span is split (e.cont.: Double harmonic scale { G A B C D E F }), and by which name we more commonly know the same circular series of intervals. Cohemitonic scales with multiple halfstep spans present the additional possibility of modulating between tonics each furnished with both upper and lower neighbors.\n\nWestern music's system of key signature is based upon the assumption of a heptatonic scale of 7 notes, such that there are never more than 7 accidentals present in a valid key signature. The global preference for anhemitonic scales combines with this basis to highlight the 6 ancohemitonic heptatonic scales, most of which are common in romantic music, and of which most Romantic music is composed:\n\nThese cohemitonic scales are less common:\nAdhering to the definition of heptatonic scales, these all possess 7 modes each, and are suitable for use in modal mutation. They appear in the table above in Row \"7\", Columns \"2A\" and \"3A\".\n\nThe following lists the key signatures for all possible untransposed modes of the aforementioned heptatonic scales using the note C as the tonic.\n\n\n"}

At its height, shortly before it went bankrupt in 1980, Big Rapids was functioning as an alternative independent distributor in the central and southern Michigan areas, selling a full line of magazines and paperbacks, as well as comics.\n\nAmong the periodicals distributed by Big Rapids were the \"Berkeley Barb\", \"Fifth Estate\", \"Creem\", \"Rolling Stone\", and \"High Times\", in addition to a plethora of underground comix.\n\nBig Rapids was founded as a Detroit-area cooperative circa 1970 as the Keep On Truckin' Coop. They eventually changed their name when they moved their headquarters to Big Rapids, Michigan, but retained their co-op structure. Jim Kennedy, Big Rapids' \"first-among-equals,\" described the company as an \"alternative Independent Distributor.\"\n\nBig Rapids' entry into mainstream comics distribution came in early 1975, when Donahoe Brothers Inc. of Ann Arbor went under and Big Rapids purchased its assets. (Up to that point, Big Rapids had bought its mainstream comics from Donohoe Brothers.)\n\nMoving their headquarters back to Detroit, Big Rapids was aggressive, often taking over the businesses of customers who ran up large debts (ironic, given that their delivery vehicles carried pictures of Karl Marx on the inside doors).

Most of the pieces were picked up by the brand-new Capital City Distribution or by New Media Distribution.\n\n"}

Autopsy results showed that Benoit's wife was murdered first as she was bound at the feet and wrists and died of asphyxiation on June 22. Nancy was found wrapped in a towel and with blood under her head, although Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard reported no other signs of a struggle.\n\nThe couple's son, Daniel Christopher Benoit, also died of asphyxia, apparently killed as he lay in bed on the morning of June 23. Then, on the evening of June 24, Benoit died by suicide in his weight room, when he used a weight lifting machine to hang himself, breaking his own neck. He placed copies of the Bible alongside the bodies of his wife and son, as well as a third Bible on his weight lifting machine. Since Benoit's suicide, numerous explanations for his actions have been proposed, including brain damage, steroid abuse, and a failing marriage. The incident led to numerous media accounts, and a federal investigation into steroid abuse in professional wrestling.\n\nOn Friday, June 22, Chris Benoit killed his wife Nancy in an upstairs bedroom. Her limbs were bound, and her body was wrapped in a towel. A copy of the Bible was left by her body. Injuries indicated that Benoit had pressed a knee into her back while pulling on a cord around her neck, causing strangulation. Blood was also found under her head, suggesting that she may have tried to fend off Benoit. Officials said that there were no signs of immediate struggle. Toxicologists found alcohol in her body, but were unable to determine whether it had been present before death or was a decomposition product. Decomposition also made it difficult to estimate pre-death levels of hydrocodone and alprazolam, found in \"therapeutic levels\" in her body. In any case, her medical examiner saw no evidence that she was sedated, as her son had been when he was killed.\n\nDaniel Christopher Benoit (February 25, 2000June 23, 2007) was Chris' third child and second son, having older paternal half-siblings named David and Megan via Chris's first wife, Martina. He was Nancy's only child, as she had no children with her ex-husbands Jim Daus and Kevin Sullivan.\n\nDaniel was suffocated and killed in his bedroom, and a copy of the Bible was left by his body. Daniel had internal injuries to the throat area, showing no bruises. Daniel's exact time of death is unknown. The reports determined Daniel was sedated with Xanax and likely unconscious when he was killed. Daniel's body had also just started to show signs of decomposition but was not as far along as his mother's body.\n\nIt was later alleged that Daniel had Fragile X syndrome, and that this was the cause of domestic problems in the Benoit family. It was also suggested that needle marks on Daniel's arms were the result of growth hormones given to him because Benoit and his family considered him undersized due to Fragile X. Benoit's coworker and best friend, wrestler Chris Jericho, stated that from his own research on the condition, the symptoms \"fit Daniel to a tee, all across the board\". With regard to those who had publicly stated that they had no knowledge of Daniel having the condition, Jericho said, \"If Chris had decided that he wanted to keep it to himself, you wouldn't have been able to pry that out of him with anything.\" Despite Chris Jericho's initial statements regarding Daniel, he later stated in his 2011 book \"Undisputed\", \"It turned out that Daniel didn't have Fragile X, but at the time it made sense because I was grasping at straws.\"\n\nDistrict Attorney Ballard later released a statement saying that a source with access to Daniel's medical files found no mention of any pre-existing mental or physical ailments. Likewise, Daniel Benoit's teachers reported that he was on par with other students and not about to be held back as previously thought. Speaking publicly for the first time in a major public interview on a \"Talk is Jericho\" podcast in 2016, Nancy's sister Sandra Toffoloni, who was intimately related with the Benoit family, unequivocally denied any claims that Daniel had ever had Fragile X or any other such sickness. She also stated that claims of needle track marks on Daniel's arms were \"preposterous\".\n\nAt about 3:30 p.m. EDT on Saturday, June 23, fellow wrestler and close friend Chavo Guerrero received a voicemail message from Benoit's phone stating that he had overslept and missed his flight and would be late for that night's house show in Beaumont, Texas. Guerrero called Benoit back and found that Benoit sounded tired and groggy as he confirmed everything that he had said in his voice message. Guerrero, who was \"concerned about Benoit's tone and demeanor,\" called him back 12 minutes later. Benoit did not answer the call, and Guerrero left a message asking Benoit to call back.\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. EDT, Benoit called Guerrero back, stating that he had not answered the call because he was on the phone with Delta Air Lines changing his flight. Benoit stated that he had a stressful day due to Nancy and Daniel \"being sick from food poisoning.\" Guerrero then replied with \"All right man, if you need to talk, I'm here for you.\" Benoit ended the conversation by saying \"I love you, Chavo.\" During a 2014 appearance on Chris Jericho's Talk is Jericho podcast, Guerrero said Benoit sounded \"off\" when he talked to him, especially when he said \"I love you\". Another co-worker who often traveled with Benoit called him from outside the Houston airport and Benoit answered. Benoit told the coworker that Nancy was vomiting blood and that Daniel was also vomiting.\n\nOn Sunday, June 24, five text messages were sent to co-workers between 3:51 a.m. and 3:58 a.m. using both Chris Benoit's and Nancy Benoit's cell phones. Four of them were the Benoits' address; the fifth said that the family's dogs were in the enclosed pool area, and also noted that a garage side door had been left open. Guerrero and Scott Armstrong were two of the recipients of these texts.\n\nDuring this time, Benoit called and left a voicemail for an unknown friend. Benoit later called WWE's talent relations office stating that his son was vomiting and that he and Nancy were at the hospital with him. He also stated that he would be taking a later flight into Houston where he was scheduled to face CM Punk for the vacant ECW World Heavyweight Championship at , but did not make the live event in Beaumont.\n\nChris Benoit, according to District Attorney Ballard and the city sheriff, committed suicide by hanging. Benoit used a weight machine cord to hang himself by creating a noose from the end of the cord on a pull-down machine from which the bar had been removed. When Benoit released the weights, the move caused his strangulation. Ballard said Benoit was found hanging from the pulley cable.\n\nOn the 2016 \"Talk is Jericho\" podcast, Nancy's sister Sandra Toffoloni clarified some details further. She said that over the weekend after the murders, the search history on Benoit's computer showed he had researched \"the quickest and easiest way to break a neck\". He had then later used a towel around his neck attached to the handle of the machine, which he pulled down using a very heavy weight and let go, breaking his neck instantly.\n\nOn Monday, June 25, 2007, WWE (specifically John Laurinaitis, the WWE's Senior Vice President of Talent Relations) was notified of the text messages sent to Chavo Guerrero and Scott Armstrong. The company asked the Fayette County Sheriff's Department to check on the Benoit family. After discovering the bodies, the police notified WWE around 4:15 p.m., informing them that they had discovered three bodies at the Benoit home and the house was now ruled as a \"major crime scene\".\n\nA suicide note was not discovered during the initial investigation, but a note was later discovered in another Bible that had been included in Benoit's possessions that were sent to his first wife. According to professional wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, \"There was a note that was found in a Bible by the mother of Chris's two children (Martina Benoit) who lives in Canada. The Bible was mixed in with Chris' personal belongings that were shipped to them.\" Chris Benoit's father Michael Benoit stated, \"He had a hand-written notation in there saying 'I'm preparing to leave this Earth.'\"\n\nWWE attorney Jerry McDevitt appeared on \"Live with Dan Abrams\" on July 17, 2007, and said that Benoit was prescribed testosterone as part of a treatment for testosterone replacement therapy, which McDevitt said was a common medical practice for people who had used steroids in the past, and had suffered testicular damage as a result.\n\nFormer wrestler Christopher Nowinski stated that Benoit may have been suffering from repeated, untreated concussions throughout his wrestling career, ultimately leading to an unstable mental state. Nowinski was quoted as saying that Benoit \"was one of the only guys who would take a chair shot to the back of the head ... which is stupid\". Tests conducted on Benoit's brain by Julian Bailes, the head of neurosurgery at West Virginia University, showed \"Benoit's brain was so severely damaged it resembled the brain of an 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient\". Other tests conducted on Benoit's brain tissue revealed severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and damage to all four lobes of the brain and brain stem. Bailes and his colleagues concluded that repeated concussions can lead to dementia, which can contribute to severe behavioral problems. Benoit's father said that brain damage may have been the leading cause of the double murder-suicide. A statement released by WWE dismissed this idea as \"speculative\".\n\nNancy Benoit had filed for divorce in May 2003, allegedly after domestic abuse from Chris, but had withdrawn it in August 2003. In February 2008, \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" (\"AJC\") reported that Nancy may have suspected her husband of having an affair with a female WWE wrestler, and that they may have also argued over a life insurance policy. The \"AJC\" claimed the source was a recently released report from the Fayette County Sheriff's Office.\n\nSpeaking on the matter in his autobiography \"The Hardcore Truth\", Hardcore Holly speculates the main influence in Benoit's actions was alcohol abuse rather than steroids. Holly and Benoit traveled together on the road during their time together in WWE, and Holly did not believe steroids played a factor and that Benoit had tended to drink more than he normally would consume when issues with Nancy arose.\n\nThe deaths were first reported to fans of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on their WWE Mobile Alerts Service and posted to its official website soon after. On its website, the company released the following statement:\n\nWWE canceled the scheduled three-hour-long live \"Raw\" show on June 25 (which, coincidentally, was supposed to be a memorial for the Mr. McMahon character), and replaced the broadcast version with a tribute to his life and career, featuring past matches, segments from the \"Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story\" DVD, and comments from wrestlers and announcers from the \"Raw\", \"SmackDown!\", and \"ECW\" brands. Shortly after the program aired, many of the aired comments were posted on WWE.com. It was not until the program was nearly over that reports surfaced that police were working under the belief that Benoit murdered his wife and son before killing himself.\n\nThe next night, after some of the details of the deaths became available, the company aired a recorded statement by Vince McMahon before its \"ECW\" broadcast:\n\nAfter learning about the full details of his and his family's deaths, WWE quickly distanced itself from Chris Benoit:\n\nNumerous individuals in professional wrestling, past and present, commented on the deaths and their aftermath:\n\nIn 2003, Benoit was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. As a result of the double murder-suicide, his induction underwent a recall election in 2008. Although over 50% of voters decided to remove Benoit from the Hall, Dave Meltzer (head of the Observer) had set a 60% requirement prior to the election, allowing Benoit to remain in.\n\nWhen the news was released about Benoit's death, most mainstream news outlets covered the story, including MSNBC and Fox News Channel. Benoit made the cover of \"People\" magazine. ECW Press (which has no affiliation with Extreme Championship Wrestling, a promotion for which Benoit once worked) announced on July 16 that noted wrestling writer Irvin Muchnick had written a book on the Benoit case, due out in 2008. At the \"Comedy Central Roast of Flavor Flav\" in August 2007, Jimmy Kimmel joked to honoree Flavor Flav that \"Chris Benoit is a better father than Flavor Flav\", which drew a shocked, appalled response, and laughs from the crowd.\n\nWith Benoit and his death allegedly linked to steroid abuse, WWE went under investigation by the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform regarding their talent wellness policy. Congress did not take action against either the WWE or any other professional wrestling company in the wake of the event. In January 2009, Henry Waxman, outgoing chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, requested that the Office of National Drug Control Policy chief, John P. Walters, \"examine steroid use in professional wrestling and take appropriate steps to address this problem.\" In the letter, Waxman stated \"In the first year of WWE's testing program, which began in March 2006, 40% of wrestlers tested positive for steroids and other drugs, even after being warned in advance that they were going to be tested.\" He also wrote about how wrestlers who test positive for performance enhancers receive light punishment and afterwards can often participate in wrestling events. The committee investigation also uncovered how easily wrestlers can secure \"therapeutic use exemptions\" (TUEs, permission to take banned substances for medical reasons) so they can continue performing while using steroids. When Waxman's staff interviewed Dr. Tracy Ray, a physician contracted by WWE, Ray claimed there was \"shadiness in almost every [TUE] case that I've reviewed.\"\n\nAt the time of the incident, research into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), led by forensic neuropathlogist Bennet Omalu, in former players of gridiron football codes was a fast-growing issue in the sport that had been at the forefront following Dr. Omalu's 2002 report on Pro Football Hall of Fame member Mike Webster done after his death. Numerous recently deceased NFL players whose brains were analysed after their deaths in later years agreed with the report on Webster's death, as each player showed the kind of brain damage previously seen in people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia, as well as in some retired boxers. Michael Benoit agreed to have his son's brain analysed by the same neurosurgeons. On September 5, 2007, Julian Bailes, the chief of neurosurgery at West Virginia University, conducted a news conference in New York City to announce the results of Benoit's postmortem brain examination.\n\nIn December 2009, nearly 30 months after Benoit's death, Dr. Omalu confirmed to ESPN's \"Outside the Lines\" that the death of a second WWE wrestler, Andrew Martin, known in WWE by his ring name Test, was attributed to CTE. Bailes told ESPN, \"When we announced our findings about Chris, some in the media said it was 'roid rage. We said at the time the real finding was that repeated head trauma was the cause. With Andrew Martin as the second case, the WWE and the sport in general have to ask themselves, 'Is this a trend?' The science tells us that jumping off 10-foot ladders and slamming people with tables and chairs is simply bad for the brain.\"\n\nWWE noted the research was new at the time, but released the following statement to ESPN for \"Outside the Lines\":\n\nBy late 2017, CTE research in professional wrestling reached a point where numerous wrestlers who died had their brains inspected for research in postmortem research, where numerous wrestlers were later found to have CTE. These included Axl Rotten, Balls Mahoney, Jimmy Snuka, and Mr. Fuji.\n\n, over 60 professional wrestlers and representatives of deceased wrestlers are in litigation against WWE in an attempt to hold the organisation accountable for their \"long-term neurological injuries\" as a result of multiple concussions and CTE. They are represented by Konstantine Kyros of Kyros Law Firm, PC, who previously represented former NFL players in a CTE-related lawsuit. The case was initially dismissed, but Kyros is appealing.\n\nSteroids were found in the home, leading some media organizations to hypothesize that a steroid-induced rage may be the cause of Benoit's actions, as some doctors have linked steroid use to uncontrollable anger, among other psychological issues which include paranoia. WWE released a press-statement, challenging the \"roid-rage\" claims. One part of the statement reads:\n\nProsecutors in New York investigated the deliveries Benoit received from Signature Pharmacy and MedXLife.com, which sold steroids and human growth hormone (HGH) over the internet. Terence Kindlon, the lawyer for MedXLife co-owner Dr. Gary Brandwein, denied allegations that his client's company sold steroids to Benoit. Brandwein pleaded not guilty to six counts in New York state court related to the criminal sale of a controlled substance. According to a report from \"Sports Illustrated\", three packages sent to Benoit were from Signature Pharmacy with the first one sent in December 2005 to San Antonio, Texas. The second package was sent on February 13, 2006 to an address in Peachtree City, Georgia and the third package was sent in July 2006 to Fort Walton Beach, Florida. This followed eleven superstars that were announced in a \"Sports Illustrated\" steroids investigation that began March 2007, which included Kurt Angle, Eddie Guerrero, Oscar Gutierrez (Rey Mysterio, Jr.), Adam Copeland (Edge) and Gregory Helms, with Copeland receiving a high amount of steroids.\n\nWWE attorney Jerry McDevitt stated that \"they believe the facts of this crime do not support the hypothesis that 'roid rage' played a role in the murders.\" They cite evidence of premeditation in addition to the lack of a toxicology report, and the fact that the steroids found within Benoit's home were legally prescribed. Dr. Gary I. Wadler who currently serves on the World Anti-Doping Agency's Prohibited List and Methods Committee and has served on its Health, Medicine, and Research Committee agreed stating that \"that was a premeditated act and that's not rage\". Investigators seized both Chris and Nancy's medical records. They also have medical records of Mark Jindrak, Hardcore Holly (Robert Howard), Lex Luger (Lawrence Pfohl), Rey Mysterio, Jr., Buff Bagwell (Marcus Bagwell), and Johnny Grunge (Mike Durham), all of whom were patients of Dr. Phil Astin.\n\nAt the press conference held by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on July 17, 2007, it was announced that three different drugs were found in Nancy Benoit's system: hydrocodone, hydromorphone and Xanax. All three drugs were found to be at levels investigators considered normal for therapeutic treatment (as opposed to recreational use or abuse.) A blood-alcohol level was found at 0.184. Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner, added it was impossible to say whether any of the blood findings was due to ingestion of alcohol or the post-mortem process. It was also ruled out that Nancy was sedated by Chris before she was murdered.\n\nXanax was found in Daniel Benoit's system. District Attorney Scott Ballard noted this was not a drug that would be given to a child under normal circumstances. It is believed that Daniel was sedated prior to being murdered, with Sperry ruling out that Daniel died of a drug overdose. The GBI, however, said in the press conference that it could not perform tests for steroids or human growth hormones on Daniel because of a lack of urine.\n\nXanax and hydrocodone were also found in Chris Benoit's system, at levels investigators called consistent with therapeutic use. Elevated levels of synthetic anabolic steroid testosterone cypionate were found in his urine; investigators believed that the level found suggested it had been taken recently. While the synthetic anabolic steroid testosterone cypionate was found in his urine, there was no evidence of GHB contrary to speculation. Benoit also tested negative for blood alcohol.\n\nDr. Phil C. Astin III was the personal doctor for Chris Benoit. His attorney, Manny Aurora, asked a judge to throw out evidence seized during a raid on Astin's office after Benoit and his family died. He claimed the search exceeded authority granted in a search warrant and that police seized other patients' records and three years of bank records and computers. According to the Associated Press in February 2008, Astin was charged with overprescribing medication in a case not connected to Benoit. On January 29, 2009, he admitted he illegally prescribed drugs, sometimes without examining the patients first, and pleaded guilty to all 175 counts against him. He was sentenced to ten years in prison.\n\nA statement regarding Nancy Benoit's death was added to the Chris Benoit English Wikipedia article 14 hours before police discovered the bodies of Benoit and his family. This seemingly prescient addition was initially reported on Wikinews and later on Fox News. The article originally read: \"Chris Benoit was replaced by Johnny Nitro for the ECW World Championship match at , as Benoit was not there due to personal issues, stemming from the death of his wife Nancy.\" The phrase \"stemming from the death of his wife Nancy\" was added at 12:01 a.m. EDT on June 25, whereas the Fayette County police reportedly discovered the bodies of the Benoit family at 2:30 p.m. EDT (14 hours, 29 minutes later). The IP address of the editor was traced to Stamford, Connecticut, which is also the location of WWE headquarters. After news of the early death notice reached mainstream media, the anonymous poster accessed Wikinews to explain his edit as a \"huge coincidence and nothing more.\"\n\nPolice detectives \"seized computer equipment from the man held responsible for the postings\" and called the posting an unbelievable \"hindrance\" to their investigation, but believed he was otherwise uninvolved, declining to press charges. The man had found several rumors on-line, which supported his theory about the Benoit \"family emergency\" as reported in wrestling news. The IP from which he made the edit was tentatively traced to vandalizing the Wikipedia entries for African wild ass, The Bronx, \"The Sopranos\", Ron Artest, Stacy Keibler, and Naugatuck, Connecticut. He also reverted vandalism to Chavo Guerrero Jr. and recorded a loss for the Golden State Warriors.\n\nIn the years following the incident, it continued to be referred to in the media. The murders led to many fans and critics of WWE believing them to be the cause that led WWE to change their programming. Within a few months it was speculated that chair shots to the head were banned in WWE, along with the use of coarse language, blood, and adult oriented situations in storylines becoming limited to nonexistent, although the programming that was on WWE television at the time of the murders was already considerably toned down compared to the Attitude Era, of which Benoit joined WWE at the tail end. This was finalized in mid 2008 in the WWE's switch from a TV-14 rating to its current TV-PG rating.\n\nThere have been discussions in whether Benoit would ever be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Steve Austin commented on Benoit, believing that while he was an important aspect of the business, he would never be inducted into the Hall of Fame due to his actions. Chris Jericho also stated that Benoit should never be in the Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n"}

However, with the site being less than 1 km from the border it was clear that this transmitter would be used to provide RTÉ services into Northern Ireland. Initially the two channels RTÉ 1 and RTÉ 2 were carried on Ch52 and Ch56 with TV3 (Ch66) and TG4 (Ch68) following later. In 1982, a 2M Amateur Radio Repeater was installed. FM radio transmission was also added providing coverage of the five national channels to a wide area.\n\nIn 2002 a new cable-stayed mast 120m tall was erected, this greatly improved coverage into Northern Ireland. The existing self-supporting tower was truncated, and is now only used for microwave links and the Amateur Radio Repeater.\n\nDAB, digital radio broadcasting from Clermont Carn began in 2006 and Digital terrestrial television (DTT) trials started in 2008.\n\nIn common with all 2RN transmitters in Ireland, analogue television transmissions from this site ended on 24 October 2012, \nbut uniquely, Clermont Carn is the only main television transmitter in Ireland that is vertically polarised, and does not service any relay transmitters. Today the Irish digital television service Saorview is broadcast from here to a sizeable area including a large tract of Northern Ireland, with a good signal being received in Belfast and beyond. \nThis overspill has been welcomed by the UK’s Ofcom who have provided information for viewers in Northern Ireland about receiving TG4 and the RTÉ channels, both from within Northern Ireland on the UK's Freeview service, and via the Saorview overspill.\n"}

{"id": "304803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304803", "title": "Digibox", "text": "Digibox\n\nThe Digibox is a device marketed by Sky UK in the UK and Ireland to enable home users to receive digital satellite television broadcasts (satellite receiver) from the Astra satellites at 28.2° east. An Internet service is also available through the device, similar in some ways to the American MSN TV. The first Digiboxes shipped to consumers in mid-1998, and the hardware reference design is unchanged since. Compared to other satellite receivers, they are severely restricted. \nThe Digibox's internal hardware specifications are not publicly disclosed, however some details are clearly visible on the system. All early boxes except the Pace Javelin feature dual SCART outputs, an RS232 serial port, a dual-output RF modulator with passthrough, and RCA socketed audio outputs, as well as a 33.6 modem and an LNB cable socket. A VideoGuard card slot, as well as a second smart-card reader are fitted to the front (these are for the Sky viewing card and other interactive cards). All share an identical user interface and EPG, with the exception of Sky+ HD boxes which use the new Sky+ HD Guide. The latest DRX595 has dropped the RF modulator outputs. A PC type interface was fitted internally to some early standard boxes but was never utilised by Sky. The latest HD boxes only have a single scart socket but have a RCA/phono socket for composite video output. All Sky+ and HD boxes have an optical sound output.\n\nThe serial port outputs data used for the Sky Gnome and Sky Talker. The Sky Gamepad sends data to the box via the serial port.\n\nUniquely, the second RF port outputs a 9 V power signal which is used to power 'tvLINK' devices that can be attached to the RF cable next to a TV in a remote room. The tvLINK has an IR detector and sends commands from the remote control back to the digibox on a 6 MHz carrier on the RF cable. This allows the sky box to be viewed and controlled from another room by running a single RF cable.\n\nAll Digiboxes used to run on OpenTV (the latest HD boxes now use what is known internally as Project Darwin software) with Sky's EPG software and NDS VideoGuard conditional access. The Digibox receives software updates over the air, even when in standby mode should an update be available. The software features Sky-controlled channel numbering, the ability to view OpenTV or WapTV applications provided as \"interactive\" or \"teletext\" content on channels, parental controls, the ability to order PPV events and some basic control over lists of favourite channels and show reminders.\n\nEarly decoders seemingly support only 700 channels approximately in their channel listing, as Sky has announced it is halting SD channels' launch applications, with over 100 awaiting launch, over 600 existing channels, and an average closure rate of 1 per week.\n\nThe Digibox remote control comes in four physical designs - blue with new Sky logo, blue with old Sky logo (this version was being issued from around the first year of the Sky service, although that logo fell out of use before it launched), black with new Sky logo (Sony boxes only) and silver with new Sky logo. However, all have multiple variations at present with a new version of Sky remote control being produced every year, to support the addition of new televisions to its universal remote control capabilities.\n\nThe units are DVB-S compatible, and usually carry the DVB logo on the front. However, their use as a DVB-S receiver for anything other than Sky services is seriously limited by their reduced choice of symbol rates (22,000 and 27,500; additionally 28,250 and 29,000 on Sky+ HD), and their inability to store more than 50 (fewer still on some models) non-EPG channels without losing them. Following a software \"upgrade\" the digibox will not display programmes from non 28.2 East Satellites. Additionally, once any form of parental controls are enabled, the \"Other Channels\" menu requires PIN entry on every use.\n\nThe box also refuses to let users view channels which are free-to-air but displaying flags claiming encryption, which locks out some channels even on the satellites Sky use themselves, such as Free to View channels.\n\nDigiboxes have been made by Amstrad, Sony, Thomson, Panasonic, Grundig, and most commonly, Pace. Although the reference designs were identical, a number of digibox lines have specific faults or traits, such as failing modems on Grundig units, and unstable tuners on older model Pace boxes. Some units add features not found on other models, such as S-Video sockets on some Grundig units, and TOSLINK output on Sony's.\n\nFor a long period of time in 2004 and 2005, only one Digibox was in production, the Pace DS430N, but Amstrad and Thomson have resumed production with the DRX500 and DSi4212 boxes respectively. Digiboxes for new customers are assigned randomly, and cannot be chosen, creating an after market for specific boxes due to their individual features. Sky bought out Amstrad satellite production in 2007 and now only distribute boxes which initially appeared as Amstrad models but are now badged merely as Sky.\n\nIn late 2005, it was announced that all future Digiboxes would have a standardised cosmetic design, although retain the three current makers, and have a slightly redesigned remote control, which would be recoloured white with some blue keys.\n\nThomson and Amstrad began supplying these boxes in late 2005, with Pace following in late 2006. The standardised design is known as the \"Flow\" design.\n\nA second generation of Digibox exists, marketed as Sky+. These PVR units have three versions: the 40 GB PVR1, the 40 GB PVR2, and the PVR3 which is fitted with a 160 GB HDD with 80GB available for user recordings, and the remaining 80 GB reserved for use by Sky Anytime. All have dual LNB inputs and an optical digital audio output, as well as all other features of the Sky box. These units are manufactured by Amstrad, Pace and Thomson only, and use a different remote control. USB ports are fitted to the PVR3. When Sky+ was launched, there was an additional £10 monthly charge to access the Sky+ functionality if two or more premium packages were not subscribed to. Sky have now removed this charge, effective 1 July 2007. Without a Sky+ Subscription, the Sky+ box reverts to the functionality of a normal Digibox, albeit without Autoview modes.\n\nThe Sky+2TB box has 2 TB to record to and is manufactured solely by Thomson. This unit is also fitted with USB ports. (this unit has been discontinued)\n\nA third generation of Digibox also exists, with the additional ability to receive DVB-S2 HDTV signals in the MPEG-4 format. The initial sole manufacturer of these Sky+ HD boxes was Thomson, and made their debut on 22 May 2006 with the launch of HDTV channels on Sky. Although around 17,000 digiboxes were initially produced, they could not meet demand and some had to wait for longer for their SkyHD Digibox. Past manufacturers are Thomson, Pace, Amstrad and Samsung.\n\nThese boxes have all the features of a Sky+ box, as well as a HDMI output, and the early Thomson DSI8215 model has component video output. Both SATA and Ethernet ports are also supplied, currently used for the Sky Anytime+ service. As well as requiring a Sky+ subscription or any subscription, HD versions of the subscription channels require the payment of an additional £10.25 (or €15) per month, although HD channels can be viewed on free-to-air services such as BBC One HD, BBC Two HD, BBC Three HD, BBC Four HD, CBBC HD, ITV HD, ITVBe HD, Channel 4 HD, NHK World HD and with a Freesat from Sky card, Channel 5 HD.\n\nOn 16 March 2011, Sky launched the Sky HD box, primarily targeted at multiroom subscribers. and also used for Freesat from Sky installations. The Sky HD box is not a personal video recorder, meaning it has no hard disk and cannot support the Sky+ functionality. These were later replaced with Sky+HD boxes, which had both sets of functionality.\n\nAll Sky boxes, whether Digiboxes, Sky+ or SkyHD incorporate card pairing. This involves the 'marrying' or 'pairing' of a viewing card to one particular STB, thus preventing one card (and indeed subscription) being used on multiple digiboxes. During installation the engineer will initiate a 'callback' from the STB to Sky via modem and telephone line, transmitting details of the viewing card number and the box in which it is installed. Once this step has been completed it is no longer possible to view premium channels such as Movies or Sports on any other box besides that which the card was paired with. Notably, the card can still be used to view non-premium channels such as Sky1 but will display an error message when attempting to watch a movie channel or sports channel with an unpaired box and card combination. A card can be 're-paired' in some instances such as STB replacement or multiroom relocation, however this must be initiated by Sky and cannot be completed by an end-user.\n\nStandard Digiboxes use almost as much power in standby as when active; the \"standby\" setting merely mutes the sound and cuts off the picture, but internal signal processing continues at the same rate. Sky+ boxes are believed to reduce their power consumption more significantly in standby because they can spin down hard disks. Power consumption for the standard box varies from around 10 to 18 Watts. Most Sky+HD boxes consume up to 60W when active, falling to ~30W when the disc is powered down. To some degree, this has been addressed with the latest DRX890/895 HD boxes. These have a power consumption of 45W max but now have a \"deep sleep\" mode consuming around 1/2 W.\n\n\n"}

It was developed by Game Arts, published in Japan by Hi-Score in 1989, and published by Nexoft in North America in 1991.\n\nThe game begins with the protagonist, identified as a female soldier from a foreign country, waking up in an inn in the Kingdom of Faria. The soldier quickly learns that an evil being known as the Wizard has kidnapped the princess of Faria, and the king has offered the princess's hand in marriage to anyone able to rescue her. The soldier travels to the tower where the princess is held, defeats the monsters within, and returns the princess safely. The King laments the fact that the protagonist is a woman and cannot marry the princess, and decides to throw a party to celebrate the princess's return instead. It soon becomes apparent that the food given away by the king at the party was poisoned by a mysterious man, and the soldier has to travel to a faraway town to obtain medicine for the townspeople.\n\nThe soldier eventually obtains the cure and delivers it to the sick townspeople, only to discover that in her absence the king had been transformed into stone. The princess informs her that the only way to restore the king is to defeat the one who cast the spell, so the soldier sets out once again. After an arduous journey across the northern continent and a land set in the clouds, the Soldier reaches the town of Zellia where an old man informs her that the princess is an impostor. The Wizard kidnapped the princess, transformed himself into the princess's double, allowed himself to be \"rescued\" by the soldier, poisoned the townspeople, and turned the king to stone all in a bid to steal Faria's royal scrolls. The old man gives the soldier a Crystal of Truth so that she may enter the Phantom Tower, a tower projecting five identical fake images that confound anyone trying to enter. Using the crystal, the soldier manages to enter the real tower and destroy the monster within, discovering that it was guarding the real princess. The pair returns to confront the fake princess, where the Wizard sheds his disguise and attacks the soldier. The soldier defeats the Wizard, only for the Wizard to use the power of the royal scrolls to begin transferring his spirit into the body of a dragon.\n\nThough his spirit escaped, the destruction of the Wizard's body lifts the curse on the king; additionally, in a flash of light the soldier is transformed into a man, revealing himself to be the prince of a frontier kingdom whose men had been turned into women by the Wizard. Before anyone can celebrate the lifting of the curses, the Wizard's spirit uses its power to block out the sun, shrouding the world in darkness. The prince sets out to kill the dragon before the Wizard's spirit is able to completely merge with it, passing through a series of icy caves that surround the Final Tower where the dragon's body resides. Discovering a legendary sword within the tower, the prince uses its power to defeat the dragon and seal the Wizard's spirit within the sword. Having restored the world, the prince returns to the king, who asks the prince to stay and offers the princess's hand in marriage. The prince declines, needing to return to his own country, but the princess asks to go with him and the king consents. The pair return to the prince's country together, and scenes from the protagonist's journey are shown as the game ends.\n\nFaria is an action role-playing game in which the player controls a sword-wielding hero, with a number of similarities to The Legend of Zelda. As with many RPGs, the game is broken into towns, an overworld, and dungeons. Activities in town include talking to non-player characters to gather information and items, traversing the overworld involves combat that takes place on a separate battle screen, while dungeons consist of combat in the same window used to navigate and puzzling through increasingly complex mazes. Combat consists of moving the player character's sprite around the screen while swinging its equipped sword or using a handful of items including bombs and a bow & arrows.\n\nFaria was one of Game Arts' first RPGs, which the company would later become famous for through series such as Grandia and Lunar. The game was an early project for Takeshi Miyaji, Yoshito Asari designer for the Lunar games and director of the first two Grandia games, and Akihiko Yoshida, designer and illustrator on the first two games and several Squaresoft properties.\n"}

The line-up consists of founder member Dillie Keane; Adèle Anderson, who joined in 1984, and Liza Pulman, who first joined in 2004. The group received a Perrier Award nomination at the 1984 Edinburgh Festival, and went on to be nominated three times for the Olivier Award for Best Entertainment (1995, 2000 and 2004), and twice for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revue (2005 and 2010). Keane and Anderson were also nominated for the 2010 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics.\n\nFascinating Aïda was founded in March 1983 by Dillie Keane, along with Marilyn Cutts and Lizzie Richardson. The members have varied frequently, but the central two have been Adèle Anderson — who joined the group in 1984 — and Keane. The trio started performing in a West End wine bar, but they soon caught the attention of the media and performed on television for the first time in July 1983.\n\nOver the years, they gained a growing fanbase and national popularity, earning three Olivier Award nominations for \"Best Entertainment\", in 1995, 2000 and 2004. They were voted \"Most Popular Act 1985\" by City Limits magazine and also earned a Perrier Comedy Award nomination. The group broke up in 1989 and was subsequently reformed in 1994, and performed for a further ten years, releasing a number of albums, before breaking up again in 2004. Their 20th anniversary show, \"One Last Flutter\", ran from 13 November to 6 December 2003 at the Comedy Theatre in London, when original member Marilyn Cutts joined the group for one last time. The show earned the group their third Olivier Award nomination.\n\nLiza Pulman joined in early 2004. That year, they performed their show \"Absolutely Fabulous\" twice in New York. First in June for the Brits Off-Broadway Festival, then from September to November at the Acorn Theatre, Manhattan. The show earned them a 2005 Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding revue. In 2007, Keane stated on the welcome page on the Fascinating Aïda official website that \"Next year will be our 25th anniversary so we really want to do a new show to celebrate.\n\nThe group wrote songs for radio and television programmes such as Stop the Week, After Hours, People Like Us and TV-am.\nSome of their most famous songs include \"Shattered Illusions\", \"Herpes Tango\", \"Lieder\" and \"Taboo\". They were the subject of several BBC documentaries. All the current members are also established actresses, mainly in musical theatre. Dillie Keane is also a writer, having written a column in \"The Stage\" magazine for ten years, and written two books, \"The Joy of Sequins\" in 1995 and \"Fascinating Who?\" in 1985. Keane says she now spends her time \"juggling acting, cabaret and writing\". The group have an official mascot—a pure bred Irish setter called \"Dillie\", born in 1999.\n\nAfter the death in 2007 of the group's pianist and musical director, Russell Churney, plans for a new show were shelved. It was announced in early March 2008 that they would get together again for a short spell of concerts and possibly a brief tour to celebrate their 25th anniversary, and the show would include new songs. In 2008 they performed at the Jermyn Street Theatre, followed by three nationwide tours. Recently, a Fascinating Aïda Official YouTube Channel was created, which shows various past performances and details event dates, and the new website was set up.

{"id": "46745265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46745265", "title": "Guardians (film)", "text": "Guardians (film)\n\nGuardians () is a 2017 Russian superhero film directed by Russian-Armenian filmmaker Sarik Andreasyan and starring Sebastien Sisak, Anton Pampushnyy, Sanzhar Madiyev, Alina Lanina, Valeriya Shkirando and Stanislav Shirin.\n\nThe film tells about a team of Soviet superheroes created during the Cold War. The team includes representatives of the different nationalities of the USSR. Each of the protagonists' superpowers reflect the strengths and traditions of the people of the USSR.\n\n\"Guardians\" was met with strongly negative critical reception in Russian media. The movie debuted at the top of Russian box office; however its gross quickly dropped, and \"Guardians\" is believed to be a box office bomb.\n\nThe film was released by Shout Factory on DVD in the USA on September 5, 2017.\n\nDuring the Cold War, a secret organization known as \"Patriot\" gathers a team of Soviet superheroes, altering and augmenting the DNA of many selected individuals throughout the former state's territory, in order to defend the homeland from superhuman threats. The team includes representatives of the different nationalities of the Soviet Union and allegedly implies restoration of former USSR. Arseniy, codenamed Ursus (Anton Pampushny), can change into a huge, incredible strong bear-man. Temirkhan, codenamed Khan (Sanjar Madi), has super-speed and wields a pair of curved swords. Lernik, codenamed Ler (Sebastien Sisak), has the ability to control earth and stone. Finally, Xenia (Alina Lanina) has the power of invisibility and can transform her body into water. \n\nThe program succeeds where a second program called Module-1 fails. This prompts Professor August Kuratov (Stanislav Shirin), creator of Module-1, to flee to the remote wilderness, away from Soviet authorities, to continue working on his experiments. When the military is summoned to arrest him, he bombs the Patriot laboratory, surviving because he was covered with some chemicals. He rebuilds his damaged body making himself into a cyborg. This gives him the power to generate electricity and control machines. He also created an army of clones of himself, and sets out to prove to the world that he is a genius. After the explosion, Arsus, Ler, Khan, and Xenia go into hiding for years.\n\nIn the present day, several walking robots used in a training exercise turn against their supervising officials and kill them. This leads to the Ministry of Defence holding a meeting and deciding to revive the Patriot organization under the leadership of Major Elena Larina (Valeriya Shkirando) and to locate their missing super agents. She finds Ler spending his time meditating in the Khor Virap Monastery in Armenia; Khan living on the steppes of Kazakhstan; Ursus in a remote cabin on the Putorana Plateau in northern Siberia; and Xenia performing stunts in a circus in Moscow. Their first task is to raid Kuratov's laboratory within an old factory, but they are captured.\n\nKuratov offers the Guardians a chance to join him but they refuse. This angers him and he keeps three of them trapped within a magnetic force field and injures Ler. He later goes to a military facility at Noginsk to take control of the tanks and other vehicles stationed there. Using them, he launches an invasion of Moscow and makes preparations to use the Ostankino Tower and the Federation Tower for his Module-2 Projec. He intends to transmit a signal through an old Soviet satellite, which will then be sent to every other satellite orbiting Earth, and use it to seize control of all technology in the world. He uses a force field to protect his beacon-tower and destroy several jet fighters that are sent to stop him. When a collaborator within the Russian military, Major-General Nikolai Dolgov, asks Kuratov for a reward for his help, Kuratov strangles him to death.\n\nWhile Ler recovers, he reflects on the fact that his superhuman abilities prevent him from aging normally. He has stayed the same age while his wife and grandchildren have grown older and passed away. At the meantime, Major Elena frees the other team members from Kuratov's laboratory. She sends Kuratov's former rival to study one of Kuratov's clones. Unfortunately the real Kuratov releases poison gas to kill him. Arsus and the other Guardians are trained in the Patriots' facility and are given suits and weapons.\n\nThe Guardians go to Moscow: Xenia and Ursus advance through the streets, Ler defeats several soldiers patrolling an underground car park, and Khan uses an airplane to try to fly above Kuratov's force field. The three Guardians enter a shopping mall, and cross an iron bar linking it to the tower-beacon, but are attacked by more of Kuratov's troops. Khan jumps from the airplane and slices the pipe, causing Kuratov's troops to fall.\n\nWhile the other Guardians figure out a way to destroy the power source for Kuratov's beacon, Xenia touches the power source and injures herself, temporarily disabling the beacon's transmissions and causing the force field to collapse. The Guardians battle Kuratov on the platform, but fail to defeat and kill him. As the guardians leave on a grappling rope hanging from an airplane, Kuratov's beacon interferes with the plane's controls. Khan cuts the grappling rope linking them to the falling airplane and they land to a river.\n\nAs they swim to a road, they consider going back to Kuratov's beacon to destroy it and kill Kuratov, but Major Elena arrives and commands them not to. She tells them that as superhumans, they can also pool their energy and release it as a blast, but doing so can be fatal. The Guardians touch each other and generate a blast of energy that damages Kuratov's tower, causing Kuratov to fall to his death. Major Elena says that, while Kuratov boasted that he created the Guardians, they really created themselves.\n\nThe Guardians recover, rendezvousing with Major Elena on a bridge in the rebuilt Moscow. Although they choose to go back to their normal lives, they also consider continuing their service to the Patriot organization. In a post-credits scene, Elena is seen attacking a soldier after his truck stops. When she questions the soldier, he tells her that \"Ferrum\" has sent him as part of an unspecified mission.\n\n\nFilming began on April 27, 2015, in Moscow while the casting process was concluded earlier that year. Filming was continued in Moscow Oblast and in the Crimean Peninsula, and was wrapped on July 14, 2015.\n\nThe reception of \"Guardians\" was overwhelmingly negative. The film was almost universally panned in Russian media, such as Meduza, Afisha Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Mir Fantastiki, among others. It was mainly criticized for having a derivative plot, bad acting and direction, cheap CGI, plot holes and overall low quality. Critics outside Russia were only slightly kinder to \"Guardians\"; however, the reviews in Times of India, Birth Movies Death and Mid-Day.com were negative.\n\n\"Guardians\" was released February 23, 2017, on a public holiday in Russia, Defender of the Fatherland Day. On its first day, the movie grossed 83 million RUB, and 213 million RUB in first four days, below early expectations, but still at the top of the weekend box office. On its second weekend, Guardians box office dropped 90% down to 21 million RUB, and fourth place. The gross kept dropping by 90% every weekend, and Russian media presume that Guardians became a box office bomb.\n\nIn July 2017, Enjoy Movies, the production company behind \"Guardians\", filed for bankruptcy, while Cinema Foundation of Russia, which provided part of the budget, sued the company, demanding return of the investment.\n\nInitially, long before the premiere of the original film and in case of success, a sequel was announced, in which it was supposed to add another superhero from China. Prior to this, the release date of the second part has not yet been announced. Later a sequel, \"Guardians 2\", has been approved, with Turbo Films, the Chinese distributor of the first film, as a co-production company. It will reportedly be partially shot in China and have some Chinese characters.\n\nAfter the failure of the box office and negative reviews of the film and the declaration of bankruptcy \"Enjoy Movies\", the director of the first part of the film, Sarik Andreasyan said that the continuation will still be, stating also that with their team they are discussing \"Who from the superheroes will die\" . However, the film will also be filmed in conjunction with the “Big Cinema”, also founded by the brothers Andreasyans.\n\nOn September 17, 2018, in an interview with the CINEMA HOUSE, Sarik replied that he was unlikely to make a sequel, and even if it came out, someone else would probably make it, but without his participation. \"I think not. Well, even if we create it, then without me! You see, the thing is, when we created this film, it seemed to us that “Wow, this is so cool! We compose our superheroes, here they do not exist in reality, but we will compose them and people will get used to them! ”But this turned out to be not the right approach. Because here Last Knight came out and .. well, it’s as if I became very cash because it’s very important to have some kind of cultural code! Here Bogatyr is a cultural code, Baba Yaga is a cultural code. All grew up on this, everyone takes their children there with great pleasure. No one there would have led his child to the Guardians because he knows nothing about it. No matter how much you advertise it, it’s too hard. That's when the French make Asterix and Obelix ... They were these comics back in the forties. And how would it be clear why this is accepted because several generations have grown on it. That is, in theory, how could you probably create the three parts of the Guardians and in ten or fifteen years suddenly ... Well, how would it be part of some kind of culture, but you know, this is not a charity. So why torture yourself like that? And what is it .. Well, today there would still be an opportunity to do it, you probably would be looking for something inherent in literature or in fairy tales. Well, that is, they would try to do it, but still something that is what the heart is pouring. When you, for example, do not have to re-understand it because, for example, Americans have seen Superman fifteen years ago and Batman and in the early nineties, that is, they put our viewers on a comic strip for a long time. So the first successful comic was only in 2010 or 2011 in Russia, which began to earn, that is, the first X-Men, which came out in 2002 or in 2003. There were no spectators because they did not understand “Why do we have to watch this?” And in a year .. That is, for example, twenty years have passed and therefore we simply do not have such a time! That's all!\"\n\nSimultaneously with the film, a comics book was published, which was a prequel of the film.\n\n"}

Ross\" in \"The New Yorker\" in the 1930s and later collected in two books, \"The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N\" and \"The Return of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N\". \nRosten noted that he was frequently asked if Mr Kaplan was his alter ego, and that he often felt it was the other way around.\n\nThe first collection (\"Education\", 1937) was a \"close second\" for one U.S. National Book Award in 1938.\nThe second collection (\"Return\", 1959) was one of eighteen National Book Award for Fiction finalists in 1960.\n\nRosten rewrote the two books as one, with many changes, published as \"O K*A*P*L*A*N! My K*A*P*L*A*N!\" in 1976.\n\nThe books were adapted as a musical play produced in 1968, namely \"The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N\".\n\nMr Kaplan is an immigrant and a pupil at a New York night class in English. He is extremely diligent and enthusiastic, but seems completely incapable of learning: the teacher, Mr Parkhill, is eventually driven to conclude that, although Mr Kaplan admits that English has rules – \"good rules, sensible rules\" – he is quite unable to admit that the rules apply to \"him.\" (In \"The Return of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N\", Kaplan's English pronunciation has improved substantially between semesters.)\n\nMr Kaplan is extroverted and highly assertive, particularly when his moral sense has been outraged by some perceived injustice in class or in American history, and he frequently gets into noisy disagreements with other members of the class.\n\nMr Kaplan usually signs his name in colored crayon with green stars between red letters outlined in blue.\nIn the last story of all, \"Mr K*A*P*L*A*N the Eumoirous\", he signs a note to his teacher simply \"Hyman Kaplan\", but addresses it to \"Mr P*A*R*K*H*I*L*L\". Mr Parkhill wonders if he will ever again be so honored.\n\nMr Kaplan was born in Kiev, has lived in America for fifteen years, and claims (on Columbus Day) that his birthday is October 12. From his pronunciation of English (the characters' various idioms are a major source of the stories' humor), it appears that Mr Kaplan's native language is Yiddish. This would seem to be confirmed when Kaplan calls flowers \"bloomers\", and a fellow student reminds him not to mix up two languages, leading the teacher to reflect that Mr Kaplan's native language refers to flowers as \"blumen\".\n\nMr Parkhill is the point-of-view character in the stories, a staid, kind-hearted, mild-mannered teacher with a tendency to think of his pupils in terms of classical literature. Mr Parkhill is rigorously fair-minded, often to his own detriment when faced with Mr Kaplan's very individual brand of logic. He is also a lonely and rather tragic character: when the class present him with a new briefcase with the initials \"M.P.\" on it as a birthday present, he is at first puzzled since his first name does not begin with M; then realizes that the letters stand for \"Mr Parkhill\" and that he cannot remember the last time anyone addressed him by his first name.\n\n\nHyman Kaplan is featured in three books by Rosten.\n\n"}

The topicality of the review was also deemed suitable for her, as she'd just finished writing weekly topical songs on the BBC1 consumer show \"That's Life!\".\n\nOther writers included were Ken Campbell, Snoo Wilson, Ken Hutchinson and Nigel Baldwin. They were asked to write short items based on the weeks newspapers around the theme of death. Campbell took stories from the \"Malaysian New Strait Times\", Baldwin the \"Holyhead and Anglesey Chronicle\", but to be more accessible, Wood drew her inspiration strictly from the tabloids.\n\nWood wrote six items in the first half of the show, including a requiem for Guy the Gorilla, a song about 'battered wives' (inspired by an article in \"The Sun\" about domestic violence). A song called 'Road Blocks' about a motorcycle accident, and a melancholy number titled 'Love Song'. The second half featured a sketch by Wood called 'Dear Mum', about a middle classed woman who refuses to visit her mother in hospital, and also a harrowing song titled 'Abortion.'\n\nIn the cast was Julie Walters. Having only met Wood briefly eight years before, the two hit it off immediately. Wood also performed in the show, but said later \"There was a sketch set in Belfast and I couldn’t do the accent, so they made me a deaf mute.\" \n\nWood received much critical acclaim for her work on the show though. The \"Daily Telegraph\" said her songs \"successfully blend a gallows humour with an unexpected touch of humanity\", and Time Out wrote \"Victoria Wood's musical epigrams brilliantly embroider the action\".\n\nThe revue was initially too short, and making up the shortfall, Wood discovered a new talent, writing comedy sketches. The sketch 'Sex' was set in a Manchester library and starred Walters as a teenage girl who thinks she's pregnant asking Alison Fiske (as the librarian) advice. As almost the only comedy in the show, it came as a welcome relief to the audience and went down extremely well. During the writing process, Wood said she discovered her true voice. \"It was the first thing I'd written with proper jokes and I thought \"aha!\" I'd suddenly found something I could do. It was a blinding flash, like learning a new language.\" \"The Times\" said of the sketch that she was a \"great discovery\" who \"got more poetry out of Manchester speech than I had heard for years\".\n\nThe cast also included Godfrey Jackman, Philip Jackson and Clive Merrison. The production ran from 13 July to 6 August 1978.\n\nDue to Wood's acclaim, then theatre director David Leland commissioned her first play \"Talent\".\n\n"}

{"id": "58903126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58903126", "title": "Irène (tragedy)", "text": "Irène (tragedy)\n\n\" Irène \" is a tragedy in five acts by Voltaire, and his penultimate play. It was written in 1776-1777 and premiered in Paris on March 16, 1778.\n\nRecent scholarship has suggested that the original inspiration for the story, though not its setting, was an account of the death of a young woman in China who prayed for death rather than betrayal of her faith. At the time he was working on the early versions of the play, Voltaire was reading \"Mémoires concernant l’histoire, les sciences, les arts, les mœurs, les usages, etc., des Chinois\" by the Jesuit priest Jean Joseph Marie Amiot and corresponding with d'Alembert and Diderot about what he read. The theme of a woman who chooses death before disloyalty is also classically Confucian. \n\nThe play was written as part of Voltaire’s plan to make a triumphal return to Paris after having spent nearly twenty years in self-imposed exile in Ferney. He wished to end his life with a great theatrical success that would secure his position for posterity and prevent his enemies from taking any action against him. He therefore set about writing a classical tragedy that would affirm his reputation and enable his return to the centre of French cultural life. \n\nTo this end, in the early part of 1777, Voltaire was working on two plays at the same time; one was \"Irène\" and the other was \"Agathocle\". Correspondence with his friend d'Argental indicated that he was initially unsure which would be more successful; he gradually came to consider that \"Irène\" would work better on stage, and it was indeed \"Irène\" that was rehearsed and performed while he was alive. Having previously sent him the manuscript of \"Agathocle\", he wrote to d'Argental on 25 October ‘I'm sending you something (\"Irène\") more passionate, more theatrical, and more interesting.'\n\nThe original working title for \"Irène\" was \"Alexis Comnène\" and it was only in a later revision that the title and the focus of the plot was changed to the heroine. The action is very loosely based in the historical setting of the overthrowing of the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros III Botaneiates by Alexios I Komnenos in the year 1081.\n\nVoltaire also wrote a letter to the Académie Française, which he prefaced to the tragedy. In this letter he emphasized the independence and importance of French poetry in relation to the English tradition in the wake of Shakespeare, referring to a debate launched by Louis-Sébastien Mercier and Michel-Jean Sedaine.\n\nIrène, compelled by her family to marry Nicéphore, Emperor of Constantinople, loves the prince Alexis. Alexis, returning victorious from campaign to Constantinople against the will of the Emperor, wishes to declare his love to Irène, but Nicéphore orders him to leave the city. Alexis refuses, so the Emperor orders his arrest and execution. Warned by his attaché Memnon, Alexis and his army confront the emperor. Defeated by Alexis but spared, Nicéphore is killed by the people. Alexis ascends the throne. As a widow, Irène is then obliged to enter a convent by her father Léonce. Irène renounces her love for Alexis at her father’s insistence. Furious that Léonce will deprive him of his love, Alexis puts the father in chains. Irène appeals for his release and then kills herself, unable to reconcile the claims of love and duty.\n\nVoltaire himself remarked that people might think the play a comedy because 'people may laugh at a woman who takes her own life rather than sleep with the man who has conquered and murdered her husband, when she doesn't love the husband and absolutely adores the murderer.' He also commented that \"I had great hopes when beginning the work, but at the end I see nothing but ridicule... nothing can undo the failings of a subject which does not exist in nature.'\n\nThe play was read through at Ferney on 23 October and first performed at Voltaire's private house theatre there for the wedding of the two of Voltaire's friends and protégés, the Marquis de Villette and Reine Philiberte de Varicourt. Its public premiere was on March 16, 1778 at the Comédie-Française. The cast was Vanhove (Nicéphore); (fr) (Alexis Comnène); (fr) (Léonce); Monvel (Memnon); Dusaulx (officier); Mme Vestris (Irène); Mlle Saint-Val cadette (Zoé).\n\nVoltaire's appearance in Paris caused immense public excitement; he was hailed wherever he went and the success of his play was more a tribute to his public standing than to its artistic merits. The dress rehearsal on 14 March 1778 indicated that the play would not fail. The play opened on 16 March in the presence of Marie Antoinette, though Voltaire was too ill to attend; messengers were dispatched to him at the end of each act to report the audience's reception.\n\nFor the sixth performance of the play on 21 March, the king's brother the comte d'Artois sent the captain of his guards to congratulate Voltaire, who then attended the performance in person. The audience shouted demands for him to be crowned, upon which one of the actors placed a wreath of laurels on his head. 'My God! Do you want to kill me with glory?' he exclaimed, weeping tears of joy. The play was performed twice that evening, and the actors then inaugurated a bust of Voltaire in the theatre, which they also crowned. After six further performances the play was taken off the stage.\n\n\"Irène\" was printed posthumously in Paris in 1779, with another imprint in Lausanne. In neither case is the name of the printer known.\n\n"}

(musical)\n\nLondon Calling! was a musical revue, produced by André Charlot with music and lyrics by Noël Coward, which opened at London's Duke of York's Theatre on 4 September 1923. It is famous for being Noël Coward's first publicly produced musical work and for the use of a 3-D stereoscopic shadowgraph as part of its opening act. The revue's song \"Parisian Pierrot\", sung by Gertrude Lawrence, was Coward's first big hit and became one of his signature tunes.\n\nThe basis of \"London Calling!\" began at the Swiss resort of Davos in Christmas 1922, when Coward presented a musical outline of a new project involving himself and Lawrence, to benefactor, Edward William Bootle Wilbraham, 3rd Earl of Lathom, who was also a friend of André Charlot. Lathom had liked it and approached Charlot to produce it. Charlot's West End musical production \"Rats\", which premiered on 21 February 1923 at the Vaudeville Theatre, also starred Lawrence. At first Charlot did not have Coward in mind for performing in \"London Calling!\", but Coward used his contractual right of veto to turn down all other suggestions for leading man. Charlot gave way and paid him a wage of £40 a week with the success of the show.\n\nThe revue featured 25 sketches, skits, songs and dance routines, with choreographic assistance by Fred Astaire who was working in London's Shaftesbury Theatre with his sister Adele at the time. Astaire taught Coward tap-dancing at the nearby Guildhall School of Music. West End's leading lady Gertrude Lawrence made her singing debut with Coward's musical works, an association that would continue throughout their careers. Lawrence had previously worked with him on the Liverpool production of Gerhart Hauptmann's play \"Hannele\" in 1913. The revue sketches made light of London society at the time, with one sketch called \"The Swiss Family Whittlebot\" poking fun at The Sitwells, known for their avant-garde poetry and ideas.\n\nThe revue ran for 367 performances. Charlot was developing a new production entitled \"André Charlot's London Revue of 1924\" and had replaced Lawrence with singer Joyce Barbour in January 1924, at which point the production was nearing the end of its 5-month run. Coward's next project was the controversial play \"The Vortex\" (1924).\n\n\n(In the order listed in \"The Lyrics of Noël Coward\", pp. 5–18):\n\nOther numbers performed:\n\nThe opening act of \"London Calling!\" utilised Laurens Hammond's patented 3-D shadowgraph process, which required the patrons to wear special colour-tinted glasses. American inventor Hammond had earlier developed a Teleview sequential viewing system for use as part of the successful productions of the \"Ziegfeld Follies\" (1907–1931). Its use influenced producer André Charlot, who was in the United States at the time of the \"Follies\", to attempt something similar in Europe. Because the patent did not have immediate effect in foreign countries, Hammond was unable to collect any royalties from the production of \"London Calling!\". With the success of the show, Charlot became referred to as \"the British Ziegfeld\", a title he loathed.\n\nApart from the influence between productions on the use of shadowgraph, the first song title mentioning the medium of radio was in the \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1922\". The name of the song was \"Listening on Some Radio\". The phrase \"London Calling!\" was the call sign of BBC Radio in London (2LO), which also began transmitting in 1922.\n\n\n"}

This world was known as the Red World. \"Lost Universe\", however, takes place in a different world, known as the Black World. Whereas the demi gods of the various worlds such as Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo and Dark Star Dugradigdo had physical presence in that world, they appear in the Black World as \"Lost Ships\", intelligent space ships of unknown origin that have powerful or somewhat divine powers with more advanced technology than any other device in the universe. Their rarity and superiority has sparked suggestions that they have been made by an advanced ancient alien civilization or by coming from the beginning of the universe itself. Being a central part to the plot the \"Lost Ships\" are intelligent beings with different loyalties and even their own agenda. Kane Blueriver, a \"trouble contractor,\" inherits a \"Lost Ship\" from his grandmother and from there, he and his sidekick Milly, together with Canal, the ship's computer, journey to find a source of the evil that threatens the universe.\n\nWhen the first novel of \"Lost Universe\" was released in 1992, it enjoyed moderate success, while Kanzaka was already had negotiations in the works for the \"Slayers\" anime.\n\n\"Lost Universe\" ran for 26 episodes, and was plagued with numerous production problems. Most notably, large amounts of the raw work for the first few episodes was destroyed in a studio fire and had to be quickly replaced leading to fairly sketchy quality for those episodes. It also ran in during the Southeast Asian financial crisis of 1998 which severely limited budgets for anime series across all studios. A \"Lost Universe\" film was rumored in 1998, but was cancelled in favor of more \"Slayers\" films.\n\n\"Lost Universe\" is distributed in North America by Enoki Films, and was originally licensed for American distribution by ADV Films who released the series onto both dubbed and subtitled VHS tapes and bilingual DVD. The rights have since transferred to Nozomi Entertainment who re-released the complete series in a new bilingual DVD box set.\n\nThe 4th episode entitled , which aired on April 24, 1998, was initially worked on by a South Korean animation company, San Ho Studio. They only had basic manuals of the characters. The result was so dismal in quality that it was later reworked for the Laserdisc releases. The San Ho depiction of that episode is no longer considered canon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "388148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=388148", "title": "Marie Lloyd", "text": "Marie Lloyd\n\nMatilda Alice Victoria Wood (12 February 1870 – 7 October 1922), professionally known as Marie Lloyd ; was an English music hall singer, comedian and musical theatre actress. She was best known for her performances of songs such as \"The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery\", \"My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)\" and \"Oh Mr Porter What Shall I Do\". She received both criticism and praise for her use of innuendo and double entendre during her performances, but enjoyed a long and prosperous career, during which she was affectionately called the \"Queen of the Music Hall\".\n\nBorn in London, she was showcased by her father at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton. In 1884, she made her professional début as Bella Delmere; she changed her stage name to Marie Lloyd the following year. In 1885, she had success with her song \"The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery\", and she frequently topped the bill at prestigious theatres in London's West End. In 1891, she was recruited by the impresario Augustus Harris to appear in that year's spectacular Theatre Royal, Drury Lane Christmas pantomime \"Humpty Dumpty\". She starred in a further two productions at the theatre, \"Little Bo Peep\" (1892) and \"Robinson Crusoe\" (1893). By the mid-1890s, Lloyd was in frequent dispute with Britain's theatre censors due to the risqué content of her songs.\n\nBetween 1894 and 1900, she became an international success when she toured France, America, Australia and Belgium with her solo music hall act. In 1907, she assisted other performers during the music hall war and took part in demonstrations outside theatres, protesting for better pay and conditions for performers. During the First World War, in common with most other music hall artists, she supported recruitment into the armed services to help the war effort, touring hospitals and industrial institutions to help boost morale. In 1915, she performed her only wartime song \"Now You've Got Your Khaki On\", which became a favourite among front-line troops.\n\nLloyd had a turbulent private life that was often the subject of press attention: she was married three times, divorced twice, and frequently found herself giving court testimony against two of her husbands who had physically abused her. In later life, she was still in demand at music halls and had a late success in 1919 with her performance of \"My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)\", which became one of her most popular songs. Privately, she suffered from bouts of ill-health and became alcohol-dependent, both of which imposed restrictions on her performing career by the 1920s. In 1922, she gave her final performance at the Alhambra Theatre, London, during which she became ill on stage. She died a few days later at the age of 52.\n\nLloyd was born on 12 February 1870 in Hoxton, London. Her father, John Wood (1847–1940), was an artificial flower arranger and waiter; her mother, Matilda Mary Caroline \"née\" Archer (1849–1931), was a dressmaker and costume designer. Lloyd was the eldest of nine children and became known within the family circle as Tilley. The Wood family were respectable, hard-working, and financially comfortable. Lloyd often took career advice from her mother, whose influence was strong in the family. Lloyd attended a school in Bath Street, London, but disliked formal education and often played truant; with both her parents working, she adopted a maternal role over her siblings, helping to keep them entertained, clean and well cared-for. Along with her sister Alice, she arranged events in which the Wood children performed at the family home. Lloyd enjoyed entertaining her family and decided to form a minstrel act in 1879 called the Fairy Bell troupe, comprising her siblings.\nLloyd and the troupe made their début at a mission in Nile Street, Hoxton, in 1880 and followed this with an appearance at the Blue Ribbon Gospel Temperance Mission later the same year. Costumed by Matilda, they toured local doss-houses in East London, where they performed temperance songs, teaching people the dangers of alcohol abuse. Eager to show off his daughter's talent, John secured her unpaid employment as a table singer at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton, where he worked as a waiter. Among the songs she performed there was \"My Soldier Laddie\". Together with her performances at the Eagle, Lloyd briefly contributed to the family income by making babies' boots, and, later, curled feathers for hat making. She was unsuccessful at both and was sacked from the latter after being caught dancing on the tables by the foreman. She returned home that evening and declared that she wanted a permanent career on the stage. Although happy to have her performing in her spare time, her parents initially opposed the idea of her appearing on the stage full-time. She recalled that when her parents \"saw that they couldn't kick their objections as high as [she] could kick [her] legs, they very sensibly came to the conclusion to let things take their course and said 'Bless you my child, do what you like'.\"\n\nOn 9 May 1885, at the age of 15, Lloyd made her professional solo stage début at the Grecian music hall (in the same premises as the Eagle Tavern), under the name \"Matilda Wood\". She performed \"In the Good Old Days\" and \"My Soldier Laddie\", which proved successful, and earned her a booking at the Sir John Falstaff music hall in Old Street where she sang a series of romantic ballads. Soon after this, she chose the stage name Bella Delmere and appeared on stage in costumes designed by her mother. Her performances were a success, despite her singing other artists' songs without their permission, a practice which brought her a threat of an injunction from one of the original performers. News of her act travelled; that October, she appeared at the Collins music hall in Islington in a special performance to celebrate the theatre's refurbishment, the first time she had appeared outside Hoxton, and two months later, she was engaged at the Hammersmith Temple of Varieties and the Middlesex Music Hall in Drury Lane. On 3 February 1886, she appeared at the prestigious Sebright Music Hall in Bethnal Green, where she met George Ware, a prolific composer of music hall songs. Ware became her agent and, after a few weeks, she began performing songs purchased from little-known composers. As her popularity grew, Ware suggested that she change her name. \"Marie\" was chosen for its \"posh\" and \"slightly French\" sound, and \"Lloyd\" was taken from an edition of \"Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper\".\n\nLloyd established her new name on 22 June 1886, with an appearance at the Falstaff Music Hall, where she attracted wide notice for the song \"The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery\" (which was initially written for Nelly Power by Lloyd's agent George Ware). By 1887, her performance of the song had become so popular that she was in demand in London's West End, including the Oxford Music Hall, where she excelled at skirt dancing. George Belmont, the Falstaff's proprietor, secured her an engagement at the Star Palace of Varieties in Bermondsey. She soon began making her own costumes, a skill she learned from her mother, and one she used for the rest of her career. She undertook a month-long tour of Ireland at the start of 1886, earning £10 per week after which she returned to East London to perform at, amongst others, the Sebright Music Hall, Bethnal Green. On 23 October, \"The Era\" called her \"a pretty little soubrette who dances with great dash and energy.\"\nBy the end of 1886, Lloyd was playing several halls a night and earned £100 per week. She was now able to afford new songs from established music hall composers and writers, including \"Harry's a Soldier\", \"She Has a Sailor for a Lover\", and \"Oh Jeremiah, Don't you Go to Sea\". By 1887, Lloyd began to display a skill for ad lib, and to gain a reputation for her impromptu performances. It was during this period that she first sang \"Whacky-Wack\" and \"When you Wink the Other Eye\", a song which introduced her famous wink at the audience. Unlike her West End audiences who enjoyed her coarse humour, her \"blue\" performances did not impress audiences in the East End.\n\nWhile appearing at the Foresters music hall in Mile End, she met and began dating Percy Charles Courtenay, a ticket tout from Streatham, London. The courtship was brief, and the couple married on 12 November 1887 at St John the Baptist, Hoxton. In May 1888, Lloyd gave birth to a daughter, Marie (1888–1967). The marriage was mostly unhappy, and Courtenay was disliked by Lloyd's family and friends. Before long, Courtenay became addicted to alcohol and gambling, and grew jealous of his wife's close friendship with the 13-year-old actress Bella Burge, to whom Lloyd had rented a room in the marital house. He also became angry at the numerous parties Lloyd hosted for fellow members of the music hall profession including Gus Elen, Dan Leno and Eugene Stratton.\n\nIn October 1888, Lloyd returned from maternity leave and joined rehearsals for the 1888–89 pantomime \"The Magic Dragon of the Demon Dell; or, The Search for the Mystic Thyme\", in which she was cast as Princess Kristina. The production, which was staged between Boxing Day and February at the Britannia theatre in Hoxton, gave her the security of working close to home for a two-month period. The engagement also gave her much-needed experience of playing to a big audience. The following year, she appeared at more Bohemian venues including the Empire and the Alhambra theatres, the Trocadero Palace of Varieties, and the Royal Standard playhouse. In 1889, she gave birth to a stillborn child, which further damaged her marriage.\nBy the start of the 1890s, Lloyd had built up a successful catalogue of songs, which included \"What's That For, Eh?\", about a little girl who asks her parents the meaning of various everyday household objects. Her biographer and theatre historian W. J. MacQueen-Pope described the song as being \"blue\" and thought that it spoke volumes about her reputation thanks to her \"wonderful wink, and that sudden, dazzling smile, and the nod of the head.\" Similar-styled songs followed; \"She'd Never had her Ticket Punched Before\", told the story of a young, naive woman travelling to London on her own by train. This was followed by \"The Wrong Man Never Let a Chance go By\"; \"We Don't Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If we Do\"; \"Oh You Wink the Other Eye\" and \"Twiggy Vous\"—a song which won her much success and increased her popularity abroad. After an evening's performance at the Oxford music hall, a French well-wisher requested a conversation and to meet Lloyd backstage. Flanked by Courtenay, she appeared at the stage door, where Courtenay threatened the man with violence as both had become suspicious of his interest in her. She took a chance and invited the man into her dressing room, where he identified himself as a member of the French government. He confirmed to her that \"Twiggy Vous\" was \"most popular in Paris\"; she was delighted at the news. At the end of the year, Lloyd returned to London where she appeared in the Christmas pantomime \"Cinderella\" in Peckham alongside her sister Alice.\n\nBetween 1891 and 1893, Lloyd was recruited by the impresario Augustus Harris to appear alongside Dan Leno in the spectacular and popular Theatre Royal, Drury Lane Christmas pantomimes. While lunching with Harris in 1891 to discuss his offer, Lloyd played coy, deliberately confusing the theatre with the lesser known venue the Old Mo so as not to appear conscious of Drury Lane's successful reputation; she compared its structure to that of a prison. Secretly, she was thrilled with the offer, for which she would receive £100 per week. The pantomime seasons lasted from Boxing Day to March and were highly lucrative, but Lloyd found working from a script restrictive. Her first role was Princess Allfair in \"Humpty Dumpty; or, The Yellow Dwarf and the Fair One\", which she dismissed as being \"Bloody awful, eh?\" She received mixed reviews for her opening performance. \"The Times\" described her as being \"playful in gesture, graceful in appearance, but not strong in voice.\" Despite the weak start (which Lloyd blamed on nerves), the pantomime received glowing reviews from the theatrical press. The \"London Entr'acte\" thought that she \"delivere[d] her text quite pungently, and sings and dances with spirit too.\" She was noted for her acrobatic dancing on stage, and was able to display handstands, tumbles and high kicks. As a boy, the writer Compton Mackenzie was taken to the show's opening night and admitted that he was \"greatly surprised that any girl should have the courage to let the world see her drawers as definitely as Marie Lloyd.\"\n\nLloyd's biographer Midge Gillies defines 1891 as being the year that she officially \"made it\" thanks to a catalogue of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; \"The Era\" called her \"the favourite of the hour\". During the summer months, she toured North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris. The 1892 pantomime was \"Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb\", in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. The production was five hours long and culminated with the show's harlequinade. During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when she got out of bed to pray, but instead reached for a chamber pot. The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her not to do it again or risk immediate dismissal. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later audience, said \"Isn't Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? I think of little besides her.\" On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of \"Little Bo-Peep\". Courtenay pulled a decorative sword off the wall and threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the Bow Street police station. In early 1893, she travelled to Wolverhampton where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called \"The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous\", which, according to MacQueen-Pope, \"ended the Queen of Comedy's career as an actress\".\nLloyd made her American stage début in 1893, appearing at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York. She sang \"Oh You Wink the Other Eye\", much to the delight of her American audiences. Other numbers were \"After the Pantomime\" and \"You Should Go to France and See the Ladies Dance\", which both required her to wear provocative costumes. Her performances pleased the theatre proprietors, who presented her with an antique tea and coffee service. News of her success reached home, and the \"London Entr'acte\" reported that \"Miss Marie Lloyd made the biggest hit ever known at Koster and Bial's variety hall, New York.\"\n\nUpon her return to London, Lloyd introduced \"Listen With the Right Ear\", which was an intended follow-up to \"Oh You Wink the Other Eye\". Shortly after her return, she sailed to France, to take up an engagement in Paris. Her biographer Daniel Farson thought that she received \"greater acclaim than any other English comedienne who had preceded her\". She changed the lyrics to some of her best-known songs for her French audience and retitled them, \"The Naughty Continong\"; \"Twiggy Vous\"; \"I'm Just Back from Paris\" and \"The Coster Honeymoon in Paris\". At Christmas in 1893, she returned to London to honour her final Drury Lane commitment, starring as Polly Perkins in \"Robinson Crusoe\". The part allowed her to perform \"The Barmaid\" and \"The Naughty Continong\" and saw her perform a mazurka with Leno. Talking to a friend years later about her Drury Lane engagements, she admitted that she was \"the proudest little woman in the world\".\n\nIn May 1894, Courtenay followed Lloyd to the Empire, Leicester Square, where she was performing, and attempted to batter her with a stick, shouting: \"I will gouge your eyes out and ruin you!\" His assault missed Lloyd, but struck Burge in the face instead. As a result of the incident, Lloyd was sacked from the Empire for fear of a reprisal. Lloyd left the marital home, moving to 73 Carleton Road, Tufnell Park and successfully applied for a restraining warrant, which prevented Courtenay from contacting her. A few weeks later, Lloyd began an affair with the music hall singer Alec Hurley, which resulted in Courtenay initiating divorce proceedings in 1894 on the grounds of her adultery. That year, together with a short tour of the English provinces, Lloyd travelled to New York with Hurley, where she appeared at the Imperial Theatre, staying for two months. On her return to England, she appeared in the Liverpool Christmas pantomime as the principal boy in \"Pretty Bo-Peep, Little Boy Blue, and the Merry Old Woman who lived in a Shoe\". Her performance was praised by the press, who called her \"delightfully easy, graceful and self-possessed.\"\n\nBy 1895, Lloyd's risqué songs were receiving frequent criticism from theatre reviewers and influential feminists. As a result, she often experienced resistance from strict theatre censorship which dogged the rest of her career. The writer and feminist Laura Ormiston Chant, who was a member of the Social Purity Alliance, disliked the bawdiness of music hall performances, and thought that the venues were attractive to prostitutes. Her campaign persuaded the London County Council to erect large screens around the promenade at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, as part of the licensing conditions. The screens were unpopular and protesters, among them the young Winston Churchill, later pulled them down. That November at the Tivoli theatre, Lloyd performed \"Johnny Jones\", a ditty about a girl who is taught the facts of life by her best male friend. The song, although not lyrically obscene, was considered to be offensive largely because of the manner in which Lloyd sang it, adding winks and gestures, and creating a conspiratorial relationship with her audience. Social reformers cited \"Johnny Jones\" as being offensive, but less so compared to other songs of the day. Upon the expiry of a music hall's entertainments licence, the Licensing Committee tried to use the lyrical content of music hall songs as evidence against a renewal. As a result, Lloyd was summoned to perform some of her songs in front of a council committee. She sang \"Oh! Mr Porter\" (composed for her by George Le Brunn), \"A Little of What You Fancy\" and \"She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas\", which she retitled \"I Sits Amongst the Cabbages and Leeks\" after some protest. The numbers were sung in such a way that the committee had no reason to find anything amiss. Feeling disgruntled at the council's interference, she then rendered Alfred Tennyson's drawing-room ballad \"Come into the Garden, Maud\" and displayed leers and nudges, to illustrate each innuendo. The committee were left stunned at the performance, but Lloyd argued afterwards that the rudeness was \"all in the mind\".\nDespite their opposing views on music hall entertainment, Lloyd and Chant shared similar political views, and were wrongly assumed by the press to be enemies. An inspector who reported on one of Lloyd's performances at the Oxford music hall thought that her lyrical content was fine but her knowing nods, looks, smiles and the suggestiveness in her winks to the audience suggested otherwise. The restrictions imposed on the music halls were, by now beginning to affect trade, and many were threatened with closure. To avoid social unrest, Hackney council scrapped the licensing restrictions on 7 October 1896. In 1896, Lloyd sailed to South Africa with her daughter, who appeared as Little Maudie Courtenay on the same bill as her mother. Lloyd came to the attention of Barney Barnato, a British entrepreneur who was responsible for mining diamond and gold. Barnato lavished gifts on her in an attempt to woo her, but his attempts were unsuccessful; nevertheless, the two remained friends until his death in 1897. The tour was a triumph for Lloyd, and her songs became popular among her South African audience. She performed \"Wink the Other Eye\", \"Twiggy-Vous\", \"Hello, Hello, Hello\", \"Whacky, Whacky, Whack!\", \"Keep Off the Grass\", and \"Oh! Mr Porter\". Feeling satisfied at the success she had achieved, Lloyd returned to London once the two-month tour had ended.\nThe following year, Lloyd travelled to New York where she re-appeared at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Her first song was about a young woman who lacked confidence in finding a suitor. The chorus, \"Not for the very best man that ever got into a pair of trousers\", proved hilarious; \"The Era\" observed that the line \"tickled the audience immensely\". Following this, she performed a song about a French maid who appeared innocent and petite at first sight, but turned out not to be so. \"The Era\" described the character as being \"not so demure as she looked, for she confided to her auditors that she 'knew a lot about those tricky little things they don't teach a girl at school'.\" Many other songs followed and were all warmly received. At the conclusion of each performance, she received gifts from the audience including bouquets and floral structures. \"The Era\" commented that \"Miss Lloyd's clever character work, her versatility and unflagging endeavours to please were rewarded with deserved success\". After the tour, Lloyd returned to London, and moved to Hampstead with Hurley. That Christmas, she appeared in pantomime, this time at the Crown Theatre in Peckham in a production of \"Dick Whittington\" in which she played the title role. In it, she sang \"A Little Bit Off the Top\", which MacQueen-Pope describes as being \"one of the pantomime songs of the year\". \"The Music Hall and Theatre Review\" was equally complimentary, saying: \"Brilliant Repertory, Charming Dresses, A Unique Personality!\" During the Christmas period of 1898–9, Lloyd returned to the Crown where she took her benefit, during which she appeared in \"Dick Whittington\". The entertainment culminated with a song from Vesta Victoria, and a short piece called \"The Squeaker\", starring Joe Elvin.\n\nIn February 1900, Lloyd was the subject of another benefit performance at the Crown Theatre in Peckham. Kate Carney, Vesta Tilley and Joe Elvin were among the star turns who performed before the main piece, \"Cinderella\", which starred Lloyd, her sister Alice, Kittee Rayburn and Jennie Rubie. The same year, although her divorce was not yet finalised, Lloyd went to live with Hurley in Southampton Row, London. Hurley, an established singer of coster songs, regularly appeared on the same bill as Lloyd; his calm nature was a contrast to the abusive personality of Courtenay. Lloyd and Hurley set sail for a tour of Australia in 1901, opening at Harry Rickards Opera House in Melbourne on 18 May with their own version of \"The Lambeth Walk\". After the successful two-month tour, Lloyd and Hurley returned to London where she appeared in the only revue of her career. Entitled \"The Revue\", it was written by Charles Raymond and Phillip Yorke with lyrics by Roland Carse and music by Maurice Jacobi. It was staged at the Tivoli theatre, in celebration of the Coronation of King Edward VII. Lloyd and Courtenay's divorce became absolute on 22 May 1905, and she married Hurley on 27 October 1906. Hurley, although ecstatic with his earlier success in Australia, began feeling sidelined by his wife's popularity. MacQueen-Pope suggested that \"[Hurley] was a star who had married a planet. Already the seeds of disaster were being sown.\"\n\nShortly after her marriage to Hurley, Lloyd went to Bournemouth to recuperate from exhaustion. Within days she was back performing in London music halls. From the start of the new century, music hall artistes and theatre managers had been in dispute over working conditions, a reduction in pay and perks, and an increased number of matinée performances. The first significant rift was a 1906 strike, initiated by the Variety Artistes' Federation. The following year, the Music Hall War commenced, which saw the Federation fight for more freedom and better working conditions on behalf of music-hall performers. Although popular enough to command her own fees, Lloyd supported the strike, acted as a picket for the strikers and gave generously to the strike fund. To raise spirits, she often performed on picket lines and took part in a fundraising performance at the Scala Theatre. During one demonstration, she recognised someone trying to enter and shouted, \"Let her through, girls, she'll close the music hall faster than we can.\" The singer was Belle Elmore, later murdered by her husband, Dr. Crippen. The dispute ended later the same year with a resolution broadly favourable to the performers. In 1909, Lloyd appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in Dundee where a critic for \"The Courier\" noted \"Her bright smile and fascinating presence has much to do with her popularity, while her songs are of the catchy style, perhaps not what a Dundee audience is familiar with, but still amusing and of an attractive style.\"\n\nDespite their marital problems, Lloyd went on an American tour with Hurley in 1908. She was eager to equal the success of her sister Alice, who had become popular in the country a few years previously. By 1910, Marie's relationship with Hurley had ended, due in part to her endless parties and her developing friendship with the jockey Bernard Dillon, winner of the 1910 Derby. Lloyd and the young sportsman began an open and passionate affair. For the first time, her private life eclipsed her professional career. She was seldom mentioned in the theatrical press in 1910, and when she did perform, it was not to the best of her abilities. The writer Arnold Bennett, who witnessed her on stage at the Tivoli Theatre in 1909, admitted that he \"couldn't see the legendary cleverness of the vulgarity of Marie Lloyd\" and accused her songs of being \"variations of the same theme of sexual naughtiness.\" As with Courtenay years previously, the shy and retiring Dillon was finding it hard to adapt to Lloyd's elaborate and sociable lifestyle. Dillon's success on the racecourse was short lived. In 1911, he was expelled from the Jockey Club for borrowing £660 to bet on his own horses to win. Dillon's horses lost, and he ended up in debt to trainers. He became jealous of Lloyd's successful life in the spotlight. Depression led to drink and obesity, and he started to abuse her. Hurley, meanwhile, had initiated divorce proceedings, the strain of which caused him to drink heavily, which in turn finished his theatrical career. Lloyd left the marital home in Hampstead and moved to Golders Green with Dillon, a move which MacQueen-Pope describes as being \"the worst thing she ever did.\"\n\nA new show in London in 1912 showcased the best of music hall's talent. The Royal Command Performance took place at the Palace Theatre in London, which was managed by Alfred Butt. The show was organised by Oswald Stoll, an Australian impresario who managed a string of West End and provincial theatres. Stoll, although a fan of Lloyd's, disliked the vulgarity of her act and championed a return to a more family-friendly atmosphere within the music hall. Because of this, and her participation in the earlier music hall war, Stoll left her out of the line-up. He placed an advert in \"The Era\" on the day of the performance warning that \"Coarseness and vulgarity etc are not allowed ... this intimation is rendered necessary only by a few artists\". In retaliation, Lloyd staged her own show at the London Pavilion, advertising that \"every one of her performances was a command performance by order of the British public\". She performed \"One Thing Leads to Another\", \"Oh Mr Porter\", and \"The Boy I Love Is up in the Gallery\" and was hailed as \"the Queen of Comedy\" by critics. The same year, she travelled to Devon where she appeared at the Exeter Hippodrome to much success. \"The Devon and Exeter Gazette\", reported that Lloyd's performance of \"Every Movement Tells a Tale\", was \"thoroughly enjoyed\" by the audience and \"[received] round after round of applause\". The paper also praised her recital of a \"Cockney girl's honeymoon in Paris\", which was met by \"roars of laughter\".\n\nIn 1913, Lloyd was booked by the Orpheum Syndicate to appear at the New York Palace Theatre. She and Dillon set sail on the RMS \"Olympic\" under the name Mr and Mrs Dillon and were met at the American port by her sister Alice, who had resided in the country for many years. Upon arrival, Lloyd and Dillon were refused entry when the authorities found out that they were not married, as they had claimed when applying for entry visas. They were detained and threatened with deportation on the grounds of moral turpitude and were sent to Ellis Island while an enquiry took place. Dillon was charged under the White Slave Act with attempting to take into the country a woman who was not his wife, and Lloyd was charged with being a passive agent. After a lengthy enquiry, a surety of $300 each, and an imposed condition that they were to live apart while in America, the couple were allowed to stay until March 1914. Alice later stated that \"the indignity of the subsequent experience [while in custody] went to Marie's heart in a way she never survived. She could not bear to talk of that awful twenty-four hours.\"\nDespite the problems, the tour was a success, and Lloyd performed to packed theatres throughout America. Her act featured the songs \"The Tiddly Wink\", \"I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)\", and \"The Aviator\". The numbers were popular, partly due to the Americanisation of each song's lyrics. On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon. The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, Edward Albee, who threatened her with a breach of contract action. She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position. The theatrical press were not convinced. The \"New York Telegraph\" speculated \"In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at the bottom of her attacks of disposition.\" Back in England, Hurley had died of pleurisy and pneumonia on 6 December 1913. Lloyd heard the news while appearing in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying \"until we meet again\". She was reported in \"The Morning Telegraph\" as saying: \"With all due respect to the dead, I can cheerfully say that's the best piece of news I've heard in many years, for it means that Bernard Dillon and I will marry as soon as this unlucky year ends.\" Lloyd married Dillon on 21 February 1914, the ceremony taking place at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon. When the tour finished, Lloyd commented, \"[I will] never forget the humiliation to which I have been subjected and I shall never sing in America again, no matter how high the salary offered.\"\n\nLloyd and Dillon returned to England in June 1914. Lloyd started a provincial tour of Liverpool, Aldershot, Southend, Birmingham and Margate, and finished the summer season at the London Hippodrome. She sang \"The Coster Honeymoon in Paris\" and \"Who Paid the Rent for Mrs Rip Van Winkle?\", the latter of which had been received particularly well with her American audiences. Within a fortnight, Britain was at war, which threw the music-hall world into disarray. The atmosphere in London's music halls had turned patriotic, and theatre proprietors often held charity events and benefits to help the war effort. Lloyd played her part and frequently visited hospitals, including the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital in Belfast, where she interacted with wounded servicemen. She also toured munitions factories to help boost public morale, but received no official recognition for her work. During 1914, she scored a hit with \"A Little of What you Fancy\", which critics thought captured her life perfectly up until that point. The song is about a middle-aged woman who encourages the younger generation to enjoy themselves, rather than indulging in life's excitement herself. During the rendition, Lloyd depicts a young couple who cuddle and kiss on a railway carriage, while she sits back and recalls memories of her doing the same in years gone by.\n\nIn January 1915, Lloyd appeared at the Crystal Palace where she entertained over ten thousand troops. At the end of that year, she performed her only war song, \"Now You've Got your Khaki On\", composed for her by Charles Collins and Fred W. Leigh, about a woman who found the army uniform sexy and thought that wearing it made the average pot-bellied gentleman look like a muscle-toned soldier. Lloyd's brother John appeared with her on stage dressed as a soldier and helped characterise the ditty. Following this, she sang the already well-established songs \"If You Want to Get On in Revue\", which depicted a young girl who offered sexual favours to promote her theatrical career, and \"The Three Ages of Woman\", which took a cynical look at men from a woman's perspective. She seldom toured during the war, but briefly performed in Northampton, Watford and Nottingham in 1916. By the end of that year, she had suffered a nervous breakdown which she blamed on her hectic workload and a delayed reaction to Hurley's death. During the war years, Lloyd's public image had deteriorated. Her biographer Midge Gillies thought that Lloyd's violent relationship with Dillon and professional snubs in public had left the singer feeling like \"someone's mother, rather than their sweetheart.\"\n\nIn July 1916, Dillon was conscripted into the army, but disliked the discipline of regimental life. He applied for exemption on the grounds he had to look after his parents and four brothers, but his claim was rejected. In a later failed attempt, he tried to convince army officials that he was too obese to carry out military duties. On the rare occasions when Dillon was allowed home on leave, he would often indulge in drinking sessions. One night, Lloyd's friend Bella Burge received a knock at the front door to find a hysterical Lloyd covered in blood and bruises. When asked to explain what had caused her injuries, she stated that she had caught Dillon in bed with another woman and had had a showdown with her husband. By 1917, Dillon's drinking had become worse. That June, two constables were called to Lloyd and Dillon's house in Golders Green after Dillon committed a drunken assault on his wife. Police entered the house and found Lloyd and her maid cowering beneath a table. Dillon confronted the constables and assaulted one of them, which resulted in him being taken to court, fined and sentenced to a month's hard labour. Lloyd began drinking to escape the trauma of her domestic abuse. That year, she was earning £470 per week performing in music halls and making special appearances. By 1918, she had become popular with the British-based American soldiers, but had failed to capture the spirits of their English counterparts, and began feeling sidelined by her peers; Vesta Tilley had led a very successful recruitment drive into the services, and other music hall performers had been honoured by royalty. The following year, she performed perhaps her best known song, \"My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)\", which was written for her by Fred W. Leigh and Charles Collins. The song depicts a mother fleeing her home to avoid the rent man. The lyrics reflected the hardships of working class life in London at the beginning of the 20th century, and gave her the chance to costume the character in a worn out dress and black straw boater, while carrying a birdcage.\n\nIn July 1919, Lloyd was again left off the cast list for the Royal Variety Performance, which paid tribute to the acts who helped raise money and boost morale during the war years. She was devastated at the snub and grew bitter towards her rivals who had been acknowledged. Her biographer Midge Gillies compared Lloyd to a \"talented old aunt who must be allowed to have her turn at the piano even though all everyone really wants is jazz or go to the Picture Palace\". She toured Cardiff in 1919, and in 1920 she was earning £11,000 a year. Despite the high earnings, she was living beyond her means, with a reckless tendency to spend money. She was famous for her generosity, but was unable to differentiate between those in need and those who simply exploited her kindness. Her extravagant tastes, an accumulation of writs from disgruntled theatre managers, an inability to save money, and generous hand-outs to friends and family, resulted in severe money troubles during the final years of her life.\n\nIn 1920, Lloyd appeared twice at Hendon Magistrates Court and gave evidence of the abuse she had suffered from Dillon. Soon afterwards, she separated from him and, as a result, became depressed. When asked by prosecutors how many times Dillon had assaulted her since Christmas 1919, Lloyd replied \"I cannot tell you, there were so many [occasions]. It has happened for years, time after time, always when he is drunk.\" By now, she was becoming increasingly unreliable on stage; she appeared at a theatre in Cardiff for a mere six minutes before being carried off by stage hands. During the performance, she seemed dazed and confused, and she stumbled across the stage. She was conscious of her weak performances and frequently cried between shows. Virginia Woolf was among the audience at the Bedford Music Hall on 8 April 1921 and described Lloyd as \"A mass of corruption – long front teeth – a crapulous way of saying 'desire', and yet a born artist – scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing.\"\n\nIn April 1922, Lloyd collapsed in her dressing room after singing \"The Cosmopolitan Girl\" at the Gateshead Empire in Cardiff. Her doctor diagnosed exhaustion, and she returned to the stage in August. Her voice became weak, and she reduced her act to a much shorter running time. Her biographer Naomi Jacob thought that Lloyd was \"growing old, and [she] was determined to show herself to her public as she really was ... an old, grey-faced, tired woman\". On 12 August 1921, Lloyd failed to show for an appearance at the London Palladium, choosing instead to stay at home and write her will.\n\nIn early 1922, Lloyd moved in with her sister Daisy to save money. On 4 October, against her doctor's advice, she appeared at the Empire Music Hall in Edmonton, North London, where she sang \"I'm One of the Ruins That Cromwell Knocked About a Bit\". Her performance was weak, and she was unsteady on her feet, eventually falling over on stage. Her erratic and brief performance proved hilarious for the audience, who thought that it was all part of the act. Three days later, while appearing at the Alhambra Theatre, she was taken ill on stage and was found later in her dressing room crippled with pain, complaining of stomach cramps. She returned home later that evening, where she died of heart and kidney failure three days later, aged 52. More than 50,000 people attended her funeral at Hampstead Cemetery on 12 October 1922. Lloyd was penniless at the time of her death and her estate, which was worth £7,334, helped to pay off debts that she and Dillon had incurred over the years.\n\nWriting in \"The Dial\" magazine the following month, T.S. Eliot claimed: \"Among [the] small number of music-hall performers, whose names are familiar to what is called the lower class, Marie Lloyd had far the strongest hold on popular affection.\" Her biographer and friend MacQueen-Pope thought that Lloyd was \"going downhill of her own volition. The complaint was incurable, some might call it heartbreak, perhaps a less sentimental diagnosis is disillusionment.\" The impersonator Charles Austin paid tribute by saying \"I have lost an old pal, and the public has lost its principal stage favourite, one who can never be replaced.\"\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n"}

It was founded to promote and consolidate Mexican folk dance, with a focus on the state of Nayarit, making it unique. However, the troupe also performs other dance from Latin America and contemporary dance as well as Mexican styles. The dancers are young and trained by the company to perform. The organization is divided into two sections, the main group and a children’s group called the Mexcaltitán Infantil, geared to very young dancers with the aim of training them to become part of the main group. Today, the troupe is supported by the Nayarit state government and García Pérez remains as the general director.\n\nWhile its main objective is to train young dancers in traditional Mexican folk dance, it also trains artists in other disciplines such as acting and singing, with the aim of further promoting Mexican and Nayarit culture. This allows the organization to create larger theatrical pieces such as a homage to Francisco Gabilondo Soler, who performed radio shows for children in the 20th century. In 2011, the group presented a program called Legends and Traditions of Old Nayarit in honor of choreographer Jaime Buentello Bazán. This production focused on the stories, dance and music of the state in times past, especially those areas along the coast.\n\nThe ensemble has performed in its native Nayarit and other parts of Mexico such as Guadalajara, Cancún, and the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City . The ensemble has toured in Europe, Asia and the Americas in countries such as France, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, England, Taiwan, Dominican Republic, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Cuba, Brazil, India, Canada and the United States. Festivals in which it has performed include Festival Internacional Cervantino, Encuentro Internacional de Folklore \"Antumapu\" at the University of Chile in Santiago in 2011, and the Miami Book Fair International in Florida . The group states that the dances of Jalisco receive the most attention abroad and most readily identify the group as Mexican.\n"}

Played at St Stithians College and all over the country, it has become one of the most popular break-time games in many schools. Although similar to the English and Australian rules, Orbliquet has its own individuality, namely relegation.\n\nThe game is made up of four ranks: King (card), Queen (card), Jack (card), and Dunce. The aim of the game is for a player to make their way up from Dunce, the lowest ranking position, through Jack and Queen, to King. This is done by killing (eliminating) players who are in a higher rank. Dunce and Jack have no privileges while Queen has the luxury of serving. King, on the other hand, does not get eliminated. King goes down to Dunce when he has been killed, and everyone else moves up. When a player is eliminated, everyone ranked below that player will move up until Dunce is open. An 'Inactive Player' who is waiting in the queue will then take up Dunce.\n\nFour square is played on a square court divided into four smaller squares of equal size. It is preferable to play Orbliquet in a squash court because there are wall which allow the game to become continuous.\n\nThe new rules of Orbliquet state that the outside lines of the court are considered in. This means that a ball landing on any portion of an outside line is part of play and therefore playable. The inside lines are considered 'lines', as it can not be determined who is responsible for the ball and balls landing on any portion of an inside line are retaken. 'Obstructions' may be called if an inactive player interferes with game play. Then the round will be restarted.\n\nEach round of the game begins with the Queen serving the ball. The Queen gets full discretion when it comes to serving and can therefore serve the ball as high, as low or with as much spin as he so chooses. It is up to the receiving player to determine whether or not he would like to return the service. If the ball is caught or missed, the service is retaken, but if the ball is touched, it is considered returned, and if it is not returned properly, the player is eliminated.\n\nThe rules are those of Four Square, with the only difference being one can use any part of his or her body, but may only touch the ball once. The game is not customizable; one may not make his own rules.\n\nA player is eliminated (killed) when:\n\n\nOrbliquet is entirely self-governed. It is important that the players be honest and fair at all times.\n\nIf there are more than eight Inactive Players, one may call Relegation into effect. This means there will be two simultaneous Orbliquet games that are interconnected. This means that if Dunce dies in court 1, he is relegated to court 2. He then has to work his way up to King in court 2 and retain the title for more than two rounds before he can be promoted to court one. If King in court 1 dies when he is at Dunce, he does not get relegated. He just joins the end of the court 1 waiting queue. This rule is a good way of increasing the level of gameplay as the Dunce is forced to kill or be relegated.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3093852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3093852", "title": "Payazzo", "text": "Payazzo\n\nPayazzo (or pajatso) is a traditional Finnish gambling arcade game, dating back to the 1920s, when it was introduced into Finland from Germany. The object of payazzo is to flick a coin into one of the winning slots. When the attempt is successful, the machine rewards the player with a couple of coins. If the attempt is unsuccessful, the player loses the flicked coin.\n\nThe game is called \"pajatso\" in Finnish. It is a Fennicized form of \"bajazzo\", the name of the early German models. \"Bajazzo\" refers to an Italian-style clown (\"pagliaccio\" in Italian). Finland's Slot Machine Association (Finnish: \"Raha-automaattiyhdistys\" or \"RAY\"), the manufacturer of today's payazzo machines, uses \"payazzo\" in English for \"pajatso\".\n\nIn Finland the game is often referred to informally as \"Jasso\". The popularity of the nickname was proven as the manufacturer decided to use only the informal form in the names of some models of payazzo combining coin flicking with an electronic game of luck. These models are \"Hedelmäjazzo\" (\"Fruit Jazzo\") from the early nineties and \"Komeetta Jasso\" (\"The Comet-Jasso\"), which is used today. The manufacturer also bought the Finnish domain www.jasso.fi to redirect traffic to their website.\n\nPhysically, a payazzo machine looks like an arcade cabinet, but it is slightly wider than an ordinary video game arcade cabinet. The front panel of the machine is transparent to allow the player see the flight of the coin.\n\nBehind the transparent front panel there is a vertical playing area that is less than a meter wide and approximately twenty centimeters high (for machines with a single row of winning slots). The thickness of the playing area is slightly more than the thickness of the coin. In the playing area, there are the winning slots, typically nine in modern models, in one row (two rows in some models). The row spans horizontally the entire length of the playing area, and it is slightly below the point where the coin enters the playing area.\n\nA metal ring used to hit the coin is on the right side of the machine (rather than on the front panel) at the height of a typical user's chest. In traditional models, the slot for feeding coins into the machine is on the top of the machine.\n\nIn traditional models, also the supply of coins available for paying winnings is visible through the transparent front panel. This way the player can estimate whether there is enough money in the machine to pay potential winnings.\n\nThe player feeds a coin into the machine and flicks it by hitting a metal ring with a finger. The power of hitting controls the initial speed of the coin; determining the initial speed is the only way the player can control the movement of the coin. The initial flying direction of the coin is constant (to the left and slightly upwards).\n\nThe coin enters the playing area from the right side. It bounces off the edges of the playing area and gates, small obstacles next to the entries to the winning slots.\n\nEventually the coin either drops into one of the winning slots or it falls down between the slots. The positioning of the gates usually makes the latter possibility more likely. In the former case, the player gets a prize of a couple of coins, and in the latter case the player loses the flicked coin. The size of the prize for each winning slot is printed next to the winning slot, varying from two times the value of the flicked coin to ten or even one hundred times the flicked coin. The most valuable winning slots are in the middle of the playing area, and in modern machines the\nmost valuable slot has a variable payoff so that the best payoff may not be even in principle achievable with every flick.\n\nThe predecessors of payazzo machines, called \"bajazzo\" machines, were manufactured in Germany in the beginning of the 20th century. The game arrived in Finland in the middle of the 1920s, and Finns started calling it \"pajatso\".\n\nThe bajazzo machines differed from payazzo machines. In a bajazzo game, a ball was dropped from the top of the machine and the player attempted to catch it into a hat held by a bajazzo figure. The first true payazzo machine was developed in the Germany in the late 1920s, and it was called Blau Wunder. In Finland, the name \"pajatso\" was used also for this machine.\n\nIt became prohibited to operate payazzos in Finland in 1933, except to raise funds for charity. Since 1937, the state-owned operator of gambling machines, Raha-automaattiyhdistys has a monopoly for payazzos. The profits of Raha-automaattiyhdistys are distributed to various charity organizations who promote public health and social welfare.\n\nRaha-automaattiyhdistys has manufactured payazzos since 1938. The basic structure of payazzo remained the same for a long time, except that the denomination of the coin the game was played with varied due to inflation. It is customary to identify the old machines by announcing the denomination of the coin used to play the game, these old machines include 20 penni payazzo (1958), 50 penni payazzo (1967) and one markka payazzo (1976).\n\nWith the introduction of the 50 penni payazzo, the gates were introduced. By adjusting the gates, the operator of payazzo can control the difficulty of the game more accurately.\n\nThe first electronic payazzo was introduced in 1982; older payazzos were completely mechanical. In electronic payazzos, the actual game is played with a real, physical coin, but the electronics are used to determine if the player feeds money into the machine, to register whether a coin falls into a winning slot and to pay winnings to the player. By using the electronics, it was possible program variable winning sums for each slot.\n\nNowadays, Raha-automaattiyhdistys operates three models of payazzo machines. The first model is Pajatso, which provides a playing experience similar to the traditional mechanical games. The second model is Komeetta Jasso, which combines the payazzo-style coin flicking with an electronic game of luck. In Komeetta Jasso, the player can also change the winning sums the machine pays by flicking a coin into a designated slot. Both of these models are played with the 20 cent coin. The third model is Pajatso RAY, which is played with coin-like metal disks. In addition to the traditional single-flick game, Pajatso Ray has other games consisting of several flicks.\n\nIn Finland, payazzos can be found in special gambling arcades, and also in pubs, restaurants and supermarkets.\n\nDuring its history, Raha-automaattiyhdistys has exported payazzos into Norway, Soviet Union, Hungary, Australia, Netherlands, Las Vegas, Iceland and Sweden. Nowadays, payazzo can be played, in addition to Finland, in Chile, where a local operator uses Finnish electronic payazzos.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The album was released on December 10, 2013, by Heavy on the Grind Entertainment. The album features guest appearances from Rick Ross, French Montana, B-Legit, Iamsu!, Sage the Gemini, Eric Statz, Skeme, Problem, Gucci Mane, Trinidad James, Jeezy, Cousin Fik, Mac Mall, San Quinn and Clyde Carson.\n\nOn October 1, 2012, E-40 announced he would be releasing \"The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil\" 4, 5 and 6 on March 26, 2013. On June 12, 2013, the album covers were revealed for \"The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil\" 4, 5 and 6. In June 2013, E-40 explained why he was releasing three albums in one day, saying: \"I’m a score and a nickel deep in the game! That’s 25 years with real studio albums on the shelf. If an artist can release two and three mixtapes a year for free, I can release two or three official studio albums a year for money. As an independent artist I do what I want, not what I can. I’m putting out three albums because I’ve got 3 decades of fans that I gotta satisfy. I’ve been through hella different eras of music and I survived successfully! It took William Shakespeare 20 years of experience to write Hamlet! I make Slaps and paint pictures with my raps and I’m in my prime with 25 years of experience. You ain’t gotta like me but you gotta respect me!\" In a December 2013, interview with HipHopDX, E-40 spoke about the direction he went on the album, saying: \"I just wanna keep it right in the pocket of what they been listening to with a new school twist, but keep the old school twist too. You feel me? So I want to make sure it's the right recipe. The right... When you dip your finger in that sauce, the seasoning is perfect.\" In the same interview he spoke about how he decided who he would collaborate with on the album, saying: \"You know, a lot of times, we get the beats early. The beat is always first. Us as artists, we like, \"This the perfect beat. Do you know who would sound good on here? Big K.R.I.T. and Z-Ro.\" And I rock with 'em. I got love for 'em, so let's see if they can get on this with me, and that's how it all unfolds.\"\n\nIn a December 2013, interview with \"XXL\", E-40 spoke about the process of recording three album's, saying: \"I’m not going to lie, this one was tough to do. To come back with 4, 5 and 6, three albums, it comes to a point where I can do one album standing on my head, easy. I’d probably have it done within three weeks or a month the way I work. \"The Block Brochure\" 4, 5 and 6, it was a trip because I did over a hundred songs and I shaved it all the way down to 42 songs. But I shaved it down because I wanted every song to poke out like nipples. And that’s what it’s doing. Just throw it in and just ride, just have a good time.\"\n\nHe went on to discuss how long it took to record, saying: \"You know, guest appearances help a lot. When you do a song with other artists—’cause everybody wants to hear another artist with their favorite artist—one thing you got make sure is when you take that first verse and that second verse, you got to be a part of the whole song. Whether you on the hook on there talking or repeating the ad-libs, that’s one thing I learned to do over the years. Now just imagine, from March 2010 I dropped \"Revenue Retrievin’: Day Shift\" and \"Night Shift\". Here it is, December 2013. Within that amount of time—just to show you my work progress—within that amount of time I dropped 10 solos and two duos, with me and Too $hort. So that’s 12 albums [from] March 2010 to now when \"The Block Brochure\" 4, 5, and 6 comes out. That’s three and a half years.\"\n\nHe also spoke about the deadline for the release date, saying: \"You know what’s the trip about it? At the end, I was trying to reach deadline, [and] then I said fuck that, we coming out December 10. Then I finally got stressed out after things was done. Ain’t that a trip? Neck got tight and shit. I’m like, it’s done, it’s turned in, I got my release date. I got my album done and all the covers. Everything is in promotions. But I guess it just caught up with me. But I’m back.\"\n\nHe also spoke about some of the features on the album, saying: \"I try to do collaborations that a lot of people don’t do. When it’s already predictable it’s not so much of a special song. I got a song with me, Big K.R.I.T. and Z-Ro [\"In Dat Cup\"]; me, T.I., and Chris Brown [\"Episode\"]. I never did a song with T.I., I always had love for him. We both had mutual respect for each other but never did one. Never did a song with Chris Brown singing. We did a rap song remix with him with “Function” [and] he killed it, that’s a great song too. My son Droop-E and Work Dirty, first of all they [on] Sick Wid’ It Records—my label—and they also family and always in the studio with me. Decades produced the beat, he family too. That was just one of those moments where it’s, “Lets come with it.” My boy Stressmatic came with the hook, “Yellow Gold.” Soon as he did the hook we was on the case. But that’s what it’s about, doing songs with people like me, Danny Brown and ScHoolboy Q [\"All My Niggas\"]. Three unique different styles, unorthodox, different voices, doing what everybody else don’t.\" On January 7, 2014, the music video was released for \"Turn Up or Burn Up\" featuring Skeme.\n\n\"The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 6\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Ronald Grant of HipHopDX gave the album three out of five stars, saying \"All in all, E-40 has built an entire career out of Hip Hop that’s relatable, yet adventurous, playful and entertainingly repetitious. \"The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil\" Parts 4, 5, & 6 continues in that tradition. While it’s a lot to ask of today’s stunted attention spans and isn’t without lapses, \"The Block Brochure\" proves that E-40 is still more ahead of the curve at crafting imaginative Hip Hop music than many new artists can ever hope to be.\" David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, saying \"Although Pt. 6 is the weakest of the three by a bit, featuring highlights with B-Legit (\"Mob Shit\"), Rick Ross and French Montana (\"Champagne\"), Gucci Mane and Trinidad James (\"Pablo\"), plus the great solo E-40 cut \"Rep Yo District,\" which overflows with both hooks and hometown pride. The rest of the disc comes off as fun yet forgettable filler.\"\n"}

He became known as Yat rather than Gert when he lived in England because of difficulties with the Swedish pronunciation of the letter G.\n\nAt 16 Malmgren intended to become a priest, but was dissuaded by his father. Instead in 1935 he began training as an actor with Julia Hakanson of the Svenska Teatern, and the following year as a dancer with Sven Trop, Ballet Master of the Royal Opera in Stockholm. In 1938 he went to Berlin to train with Eugenie Edwardova, former character dancer with Pavlova, and with Trude Engelhardt of the Mary Wigman company. While still in training he gave solo recitals throughout Sweden, followed in 1939-40 by solo recitals in Stockholm, Berlin, Warsaw and Paris where he began studying with Mme Preobrajenska. He was awarded the Gold medal at the \"Concours de la Danse\" in Brussels in 1939 and was spotted by Kurt Jooss who invited him to join Ballets Jooss based at Dartington Hall. It was here that he first met Rudolf Laban with whom he later collaborated in developing his theory of Movement Psychology. During the war he toured as a soloist with Ballets Jooss throughout the British Isles, Ireland, Canada, North and South America. He left the company in Buenos Ayres and spent the rest of the war period in Brazil, partnering the ballerina Nini Theilade in solo recitals and opening a movement school in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nHe returned to Europe in 1947 to give recitals in Sweden and Finland with Nini Theilade. In 1948 he was invited to join the International Ballet Company as premier danseur, and continued his training with Judith Espinosa in London, and Mmes Preobrajenska and Egorova in Paris. He appeared as 'the Baron' in \"Gaite Parisienne\" opposite the choreographer Massine, in his old role. A season at Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro with Tatiana Leskova in 1950 was followed by tours throughout Britain and Europe.\n\nIn 1954, following a serious injury he was forced to retire as a dancer, and began teaching classes at the International School of Ballet in London. The actor Harold Lang persuaded him to start giving movement classes in the Anna Northcote studio in West Street, Covent Garden, and actors including Sean Connery, Diane Cilento, Patricia Neal, Gillian Lynne, Brian Bedford and Anthony Hopkins together with directors Tony Richardson, Bill Gaskill, Alexsander Mackendrick and Seth Holt all attended. He worked privately with Sean Connery for a year who appeared in 'Anna Christie' in Oxford, and particularly as Dionysus in Euripides's the Bacchae before his first success as James Bond.\n\nMalmgren was a key figure at the Drama Centre London along with co-founder Christopher Fettes, John and Catherine Blatchley (Clouzot), Harold Lang and Doreen Cannon. His teaching approach drew from the applied psychology of movement developed by Laban. Malmgren's method of character development is concerned with a technique for expressing the inner state of a character through movement, and is a synthesis of Laban's theory of movement expression, C.G. Jung's character types (published in 1923) and key principles of acting established by Constantin Stanislavski.\nMalmgren taught a number of famous actors including: Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Anthony Hopkins, Andrew Tiernan, Geraldine James, Helen McCrory, Paul Bettany, Russell Brand, Anne-Marie Duff, John Simm, Sean Harris, Andrew Pleavin, Diane Cilento, Michael Fassbender and Tom Hardy.\n\nAn article describing the main features of Malmgren's approach to actor training, and bringing these up to date with aspects of contemporary thinking on cognitive science was published in April 2015: Vladimir Mirodan, \"Acting the Metaphor - The Laban-Malmgren system of movement psychology and character analysis\", Theatre, Dance and Performance Training Journal, Vol. 6, Issue 1. The system is also described in detail in two PhD theses. The first, entitled \"The Way of Transformation (The Laban – Malmgren System of Character Analysis)\" is by Vladimir Mirodan, Principal of the Drama Centre 2001-2011. This thesis is available online through the British Library. The second, entitled \"The Knowing Body: Meaning and method in Yat Malmgren's actor training technique\" is by Janys Hayes and is available through the National Library of Australia.\n\nSeveral institutions around the world teach the method developed by Malmgren, which has come to be known as the \"Yat\" method of character analysis. These institutions include- in London, the Drama Centre, Room One, the Giles Foreman Centre for Acting, where Christopher Fettes continues to teach Yat's method (GFCA also partners with studios in Paris, Luxembourg and Zurich), and Central School of Speech and Drama; Schott Acting Studio in Berlin; Gothenburg University - where Yat became an honorary doctor, in Sweden; Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney and the University of Wollongong in New South Wales; and the Yat/Bentley Centre for Performance in the United States and Canada. His work also influences training in Israel, Peru, Iran, Brazil, and Iceland, amongst many others.\n\n"}
