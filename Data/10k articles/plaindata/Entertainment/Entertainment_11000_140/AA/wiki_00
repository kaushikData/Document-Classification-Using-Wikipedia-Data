{"id": "1869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869", "title": "Alfred Jarry", "text": "Alfred Jarry\n\nAlfred Jarry (; 8 September 1873 – 1 November 1907) was a French symbolist writer who is best known for his play \"Ubu Roi\" (1896). a pataphysical work which depicts the bourgeoisie as the super-mediocre. He coined the term and philosophical concept of 'pataphysics which uses absurd irony to portray symbolic truths (and playfully vice versa) .\n\nJarry was born in Laval, Mayenne, France, and his mother was from Brittany. He was associated with the Symbolist movement. His play \"Ubu Roi\" is often cited as a forerunner of Dada and the Surrealist and Futurist movements of the 1920s and 1930s. He wrote in a variety of hybrid genres and styles, prefiguring the postmodern, including novels, poems, short plays and opera bouffes, absurdist essays and speculative journalism. His texts are considered examples of absurdist literature and postmodern philosophy.\n\nHis father Anselme Jarry (1837-1895) was a salesman who descended into alcoholism; his mother Caroline, née Quernest (1842-1893), was interested in music and literature, but her family had a streak of insanity, and her mother and brother were institutionalized. The couple had two surviving children, a daughter Caroline-Marie, called Charlotte (1865-1925), and Alfred. In 1879 Caroline left Anselme and took the children to Saint-Brieuc in Brittany.\n\nIn 1888 the family moved to Rennes, where Jarry entered the lycée at 15. There he led a group of boys who enjoyed poking fun at their well-meaning, but obese and incompetent physics teacher, a man named Hébert. Jarry and his classmate, Henri Morin, wrote a play they called \"Les Polonais\" and performed it with marionettes in the home of one of their friends. The main character, \"Père Heb\", was a blunderer with a huge belly, three teeth (one of stone, one of iron and one of wood), a single, retractable ear and a misshapen body. In Jarry's later work \"Ubu Roi\", Père Heb would develop into Ubu, one of the most monstrous and astonishing characters in French literature.\n\nAt 17 Jarry passed his baccalauréat and moved to Paris to prepare for admission to the École Normale Supérieure. Though he was not admitted, he soon gained attention for his original poems and prose-poems. A collection of his work, \"Les minutes de sable mémorial\", was published in 1893.\n\nThat same year, Jarry contracted influenza. His mother and sister tended him, but once he recovered his mother fell ill of the disease and died; two years later his father perished from influenza as well, leaving Jarry a small inheritance which he quickly spent.\n\nJarry had meantime discovered the pleasures of alcohol, which he called \"my sacred herb\" or, when referring to absinthe, the \"green goddess.\" A story is told that he once painted his face green and rode through town on his bicycle in its honour (and possibly under its influence).\n\nWhen he was drafted into the army in 1894, his gift for turning notions upside down defeated attempts to instill military discipline. The sight of the small man in a uniform much too large for his less than 5-foot frame—the army did not issue uniforms small enough—was so disruptively funny that he was excused from parades and marching drills. Eventually the army discharged him for medical reasons. His military experience eventually inspired his novel \"Days and Nights\".\nJarry returned to Paris and applied himself to writing, drinking and the company of friends who appreciated his witty, sweet-tempered and unpredictable conversation. This period is marked by his intense involvement with Remy de Gourmont in the publication of \"L'Ymagier ,\" a luxuriously produced \"art\" magazine devoted to the symbolic analysis of medieval and popular prints. Symbolism as an art movement was in full swing at this time, and \"L'Ymagier\" provided a nexus for many of its key contributors. Jarry's play \"Caesar Antichrist\" (1895) drew on this movement for material. This is a work that bridges the gap between serious symbolic meaning and the type of critical absurdity with which Jarry would soon become associated. Using the biblical Book of Revelation as a point of departure, \"Caesar Antichrist\" presents a parallel world of extreme formal symbolism in which Christ is resurrected not as an agent of spirituality but as an agent of the Roman Empire that seeks to dominate spirituality. It is a unique narrative that effectively links the domination of the soul to contemporaneous advances in the field of Egyptology such as the 1894 excavation of the Narmer Palette, an ancient artifact used for situating the rebus within hermeneutics. The character Ubu Roi first appears in this play.\nThe spring of 1896 saw the publication, in Paul Fort's review \"Le Livre d'art\", of Jarry's 5-act play \"Ubu Roi,\" the rewritten and expanded \"Les Polonais\" of his school days. \"Ubu Roi\"s savage humor and monstrous absurdity, unlike anything thus far performed in French theater, seemed unlikely to ever actually be performed on stage. However, impetuous theater director Aurélien-Marie Lugné-Poe took the risk, producing the play at his Théâtre de l'Œuvre.\n\nOn opening night (10 December 1896), with traditionalists and the avant-garde in the audience, King Ubu (played by Firmin Gémier) stepped forward and intoned the opening word, \"Merdre!\" (often translated as \"Pshit\" or \"Shittr!\" in English). A quarter of an hour of pandemonium ensued: outraged cries, booing, and whistling by the offended parties, countered by cheers and applause by the more degenerate contingent. Such interruptions continued through the evening. At the time, only the dress rehearsal and opening night performance were held, and the play was not revived until after Jarry's death.\n\nThe play brought fame to the 23-year-old Jarry, and he immersed himself in the fiction he had created. Gémier had modeled his portrayal of Ubu on Jarry's own staccato, nasal vocal delivery, which emphasized each syllable (even the silent ones). From then on, Jarry would always speak in this style. He adopted Ubu's ridiculous and pedantic figures of speech; for example, he referred to himself using the royal \"we\", and called the wind \"that which blows\" and the bicycle he rode everywhere \"that which rolls.\"\n\nJarry moved into a flat which the landlord had created through the unusual expedient of subdividing a larger flat by means of a horizontal rather than a vertical partition. The diminutive Jarry could just manage to stand up in the place, but guests had to bend or crouch. Jarry also took to carrying a loaded revolver. In response to a neighbor's complaint that his target shooting endangered her children, he replied, \"If that should ever happen, ma-da-me, we should ourselves be happy to get new ones with you.\"\n\nWith Franc-Nohain and Claude Terrasse he co-founded the Théatre des Pantins, which in 1898 was the site of marionette performances of \"Ubu Roi\".\n\nLiving in worsening poverty, neglecting his health and drinking excessively, Jarry went on to write the novel \"Le Surmâle\" (\"The Supermale\"), which is partly a satire on the Symbolist ideal of self-transcendence.\n\nUnpublished until after his death, his fiction \"Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician\" (\"Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien\") describes the exploits and teachings of a sort of antiphilosopher who, born at age 63, travels through a hallucinatory Paris in a sieve and subscribes to the tenets of \"'pataphysics\". 'Pataphysics deals with \"the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one.\" In 'pataphysics, every event in the universe is accepted as an extraordinary event.\n\nJarry once wrote, expressing some of the bizarre logic of 'pataphysics, \"If you let a coin fall and it falls, the next time it is just by an infinite coincidence that it will fall again the same way; hundreds of other coins on other hands will follow this pattern in an infinitely unimaginable fashion.\"\n\nIn his final years, he was a legendary and heroic figure to some of the young writers and artists in Paris. Guillaume Apollinaire, André Salmon and Max Jacob sought him out in his truncated apartment. Pablo Picasso was fascinated with Jarry. After Jarry's death Picasso acquired his revolver and wore it on his nocturnal expeditions in Paris. He later bought many of his manuscripts as well as executing a fine drawing of him.\n\nJarry died in Paris on 1 November 1907 of tuberculosis, aggravated by drug and alcohol use. When he could not afford alcohol, he drank ether. It is recorded that his last request was for a toothpick. He was interred in the Cimetière de Bagneux, near Paris.\n\nThe complete works of Alfred Jarry are published in three volumes by Gallimard in the collection \"Bibliothèque de la Pléiade\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "619520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=619520", "title": "All-Channel Receiver Act", "text": "All-Channel Receiver Act\n\nThe All-Channel Receiver Act of 1962 (ACRA) (), commonly known as the All-Channels Act, was passed by the United States Congress in 1961, to allow the Federal Communications Commission to require that all television set manufacturers must include UHF tuners, so that new UHF-band TV stations (then channels 14 to 83) could be received by the public. This was a problem at the time since the Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) were well-established on VHF, while many local-only stations on UHF were struggling for survival.\n\nThe All-Channel Receiver Act provides that the Federal Communications Commission shall \"have authority to require that apparatus designed to receive television pictures broadcast simultaneously with sound be capable of adequately receiving all frequencies allocated by the Commission to television broadcasting.\" Under authority provided by the All Channel Receiver Act, the FCC adopted a number of technical standards to increase parity between the UHF and VHF television services, including a 14dB maximum UHF noise figure for television receivers.\n\nWhile the first U.S. commercially licensed UHF television stations signed on as early as 1952, the majority of the 165 UHF stations to begin telecasting between 1952 and 1959 did not survive. UHF local stations of the 1950s were limited by the range their signals could supposedly travel, the lack of UHF tuners in most TV sets and difficulties in finding advertisers and TV network affiliations. Of the 82 new UHF TV stations in the United States broadcasting as of June 1954, only 24 remained on the air a year later.\n\nFourth-network operators such as the DuMont Television Network, forced to expand using UHF affiliates due to a lack of available VHF channels, were not viable and soon folded. The fraction of new TV receivers that were factory-equipped with all-channel tuners dropped from 20% in 1953 to 9.0% by 1958, a drop that was only partially compensated for by field upgrades or the availability of UHF converters for separate purchase. By 1961, with 83 commercial UHF stations still on-air, the number of new TVs capable of receiving UHF as well as VHF channels had fallen to a record low of 5.5% with a small number of viable stations situated in localities where a lack of available VHF frequencies had forced early expansion onto UHF.\n\nWhile public educational television was available from 105 US stations by 1965, many of them in the already-crowded VHF spectrum, only 18 percent of the large number of UHF frequencies reserved for educational use in US cities were in active use. In areas where audiences had no UHF receivers, a station broadcasting above channel 13 was unlikely to survive.\n\nUnder the All-Channel Receiver Act, FCC regulations would ensure that all new TV sets sold in the U.S. after 1964 had built-in UHF tuners. By 1971, there would be more than 170 full-service UHF broadcast stations nationwide; the number of UHF stations would grow further to accommodate new television networks such as the Public Broadcasting Service (1970), Fox (1986), Univision (1986) and Telemundo (1987).\n\nUHF TV stations would ultimately outnumber their long-established VHF counterparts.\n\nThe act has most recently been used in 2005-2007 ( and ) to require TV manufacturers to include ATSC-T (terrestrial TV) tuners for digital television, in any TV set that includes an NTSC analog TV tuner. This requirement has been phased-in during the mid-2000s, starting with the largest TV sets. By early 2007, every device capable of receiving over-the-air TV (including VCRs) was forced to include an ATSC tuner. Millions of dollars in fines were imposed in 2008 by the Federal Communications Commission against vendors, including various name-brand retail chains such as Best Buy, Sears/Kmart and Walmart. Best Buy is disputing both the fines and the authority of the FCC to impose the penalties; Circuit City and Sears also disputed the charges.\n\nIn late March 2008, the Community Broadcasters Association filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, seeking an injunction to halt the sale and distribution of DTV converter boxes, charging that their failure to include analog tuners or analog passthrough violates the All-Channel Receiver Act. Responding to CBA's actions, the FCC and NTIA urged manufacturers to include the feature voluntarily in all converter boxes, and manufacturers responded by releasing a new generation of models with the feature. In early May 2008, the D.C. district court denied the CBA petition without comment, effectively telling the association that it had not exhausted all its efforts, and that there was not enough merit to take the case to the courts.\n\nIn July 2010, the FCC granted a waiver allowing Dell, LG, and Hauppauge to fail to include tuners for NTSC analog TV or standard ATSC digital TV in mobile television devices designed to receive ATSC-M/H signals. While all full-power stations have been forced to turn off their analog signals, and most low-power TV stations therefore have been forced to digital as the \"de facto\" standard, the vast majority of stations do not transmit a mobile-TV signal, which will leave viewers with these devices unable to receive most broadcasts. Because LPTV stations have already had their limited financial resources drained by having to buy and install new digital equipment, it is unlikely that any LPTV stations will be seen on mobile TV because of this waiver, which also applies to other companies.\n\nIn the 1980s, this law was used to require that all AM receivers be able to pick up the new expanded band stations from 1610 to 1700 kilohertz. This requirement was enacted in advance of new stations being allotted in the 1990s.\n\nIt has been proposed in 2009 to require HD Radio receivers to be included in all satellite radio (SDARS) receivers, in response to the monopoly created by the XM/Sirius merger. All three use proprietary systems, and there have been no considerations to require the inclusion of open standards like FMeXtra, DRM+, DAB+ or DMB, which are compatible anywhere outside of the United States. A notice of inquiry (a predecessor to a full rulemaking proceeding) is before the FCC as docket 08-172. A bill had been submitted to the U.S. House as the Radio All Digital Channel Receiver Act in 2008 but was not passed into law.\n\n"}

Specifically, it is a type of enallage (the substitution of grammatically different but semantically equivalent constructions) in which one grammatical case is substituted for another.\n\nIn English, this technique is utilized only with pronouns, and is more effective with languages that utilize inflected nouns, such as Greek and Latin (or any other derivative romance language).\n\nOne form of the device is to replace the conjunction \"and\" with the preposition \"of\", thus changing the case of the second noun from a case agreeing with the first noun to the genitive case.\n\nThis is similar to the technique hendiadys, by applying “of” rather than “and” as well as the technique hypallage, except the governing noun becomes the adjective instead of the noun in regimen.\n\nThe classic example of the use of antiptosis is:\ninstead of\nWhere the relation of kingdom and glory are altered by antiptosis.\n\nIn another example, one might say \"That dress is you!\" rather than \"That dress is becoming to you,\" placing \"you\" in the nominative case rather than the expected objective case to emphasize the point being made.\n\nAnother prime example is \"Me Jane, Tarzan,\" where \"me\" is used (the objective case pronoun) instead of the proper subjective case pronoun, \"I\". This example also includes ellipsis of the verb \"am.”\n"}

The film stars James McAvoy, Keira Knightley, Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Vanessa Redgrave, and chronicles a crime and its consequences over the course of six decades, beginning in the 1930s. It was produced by Working Title Films and filmed in England. Distributed in most of the world by Universal Studios, it was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 7 September 2007 and in North America on 7 December 2007.\n\n\"Atonement\" opened both the 2007 Vancouver International Film Festival and the 64th Venice International Film Festival, making Wright, at the age of 35, the youngest director ever to open the latter event. A commercial success, the film earned a worldwide gross of approximately $129 million against a budget of $30 million. Critics gave the drama positive reviews, praising its acting performances, its cinematography and Dario Marianelli's score.\n\n\"Atonement\" won an Oscar for Best Original Score at the 80th Academy Awards, and was nominated for six others, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Ronan. It also garnered fourteen nominations at the 61st British Academy Film Awards, winning both Best Film and Production Design, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama.\n\nIn 1935 England, Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old from a wealthy family. She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins.\n\nLooking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water.\n\nRobbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including the word \"cunt\": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter.\n\nBriony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes it to her older visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a \"sex maniac\". Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony's older brother's and a chocolate magnate, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola.\n\nBefore dinner, Robbie apologises for the obscene letter, but Cecilia surprises him and confesses her secret love for him. They then to proceed to make passionate love in the library when Briony walks in, and thinks that Cecilia is under attack. Cecilia and Robbie try to pass the incident off.\n\nAt dinner, Briony finds that Lola's twin brothers have run away, and Paul calls for a search of the estate grounds. In the course of it, Briony glimpses Lola having sex with a man. She goes to Lola, and they make statements to one another that appear to establish that it was rape perpetrated by Robbie. The belief is sustained during police questioning, and the earlier note is seen as corroborative evidence. Robbie's arrest and imprisonment follow.\n\nAbout four years later, during World War II, Robbie has been released from prison on condition that he join the army, and is fighting in the Battle of France. Separated from his unit, he is making his way on foot to Dunkirk, all the while thinking of his meeting with Cecilia in London six months earlier: they had renewed their love before she returned to her work as a nurse, and he set off to the French front.\n\nBriony, now 18, has chosen to join Cecilia's old nursing unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London rather than go to the University of Cambridge, because she wants to be of \"practical use to society\". She writes to her sister, but Cecilia has not forgiven her for lying in the investigation years before.\n\nRobbie, who is falling gravely ill from an infected wound, finally arrives at the beaches of Dunkirk, where he waits to be evacuated.\n\nLater, Briony—who now regrets her lie—learns from a newsreel that Paul Marshall, who owns a factory supplying rations to the British army, is about to be married to Lola. Briony goes to the ceremony, and as the priest asks if anyone objects to the union, she recalls seeing Paul assault Lola. However, she remains silent. As Paul and Lola leave the church, they glance at Briony, but also say nothing.\n\nAfterwards, Briony visits Cecilia to apologise to her directly. She is surprised to find her sister with Robbie, who is in London on leave. Briony apologises for her deceit, but Robbie is enraged that she has still not accepted responsibility for her actions, when soldiers younger than she have died in the war. Cecilia calms him down, and the couple ask Briony to confess and to have the legal record rectified. Briony agrees. However, she also has to tell them that Paul has married Lola. He is now most unlikely to be punished, as Lola will be unable to testify against her husband, and Briony will be regarded as an unreliable witness.\n\nBriony is now elderly and a successful novelist, giving an interview about her latest book that will cap her career; she is now dying of vascular dementia. She says that this autobiographical novel, entitled \"Atonement\", has been very difficult to write, because she did not know how to approach what she had done to Robbie and Cecilia. She has worked on it from the very beginning of her career. She confesses that the scene in the book describing her visit and apology to Cecilia and Robbie was entirely imaginary.\n\nCecilia and Robbie were never reunited: Robbie died of septicaemia at Dunkirk on the morning of the day he was to be evacuated, and Cecilia drowned months later in the Balham tube station bombing during the Blitz. Briony hopes to give the two, in fiction, the happiness that she robbed them of in real life. The last scene shows an imagined, happily reunited Cecilia and Robbie living on in a house by the sea.\n\n\nThe film was produced by Working Title Films and filmed throughout the summer of 2006 in Great Britain.\n\nThese mainly were:\n\nThe other places across London were Great Scotland Yard and Bethnal Green Town Hall, the latter being used for a 1939 tea-house scene, as well as the church of St John's, Smith Square, Westminster for Lola's wedding. Re-enactment of the 1940 Balham station disaster took place in the former Piccadilly line station of Aldwych, closed since the 1990s.\n\nWar scenes (in the French countryside) were filmed in Coates and Gedney Drove End, Lincolnshire; Walpole St Andrew and Denver, Norfolk; and in Manea and Pymoor, Cambridgeshire.\n\nMuch of the St Thomas's hospital ward interior was filmed at Park Place, Berkshire and exterior at University College London.\n\nAll the exteriors and interiors of the Tallis family home were at Stokesay Court, selected from an old \"Country Life\" edition to tie in with the period and pool fountain of the novel. This mansion was built in 1889 commissioned by the glove manufacturer John Derby Allcroft. It remains an undivided family home.\n\nThe third portion of \"Atonement\" was entirely filmed at the BBC Television Centre, London. The beach with cliffs first shown on the postcard and later seen towards the end of the film was Cuckmere Haven Seven Sisters, Sussex (near to Roedean School, which Cecilia was said to have attended).\n\nThe film opened the 2007 Venice International Film Festival, making Wright, at 35, the youngest director ever to be so honoured.

The Australian edition of \"Empire\" gave it a five-star review, praising Wright's direction in the second half of the film, where he demonstrates \"storytelling and technical flair to match his ability with actors\". \"Time\" magazine's Richard Corliss named the film one of the Top 10 Movies of 2007, ranking it at #4. Corliss praised the film as \"first beguiling, then devastating\", and singled out Saoirse Ronan as \"terrific as the confused 12-year-old.\"\n\nThe American critic Roger Ebert gave it a four-star review, dubbing it \"one of the year's best films, a certain best picture nominee.\" In the film review television program, \"At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper\", Richard Roeper gave the film \"thumbs up\" adding that Knightley gave \"one of her best performances\". As for the film, he commented that \"\"Atonement\" has hints of greatness but it falls just short of Oscar contention\".\n\nThe film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007.\n\nThe film has received numerous awards and nominations, including seven Golden Globe nominations, more than any other film nominated at the 65th Golden Globe Awards, and winning two of the nominated Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture Drama.

The film premiered on Cartoon Network on November 25, 2009.\n\nThe film opens as Ben, Gwen, and Kevin are negotiating with a group of black market dealers at a mill, who are attempting to sell them alien nanochips, which are causing interference with the Omnitrix. One of them reveals herself to be Elena, a childhood friend of Ben and Gwen and a fellow Plumber's kid. Elena explains that she had set up negotiations to lure Ben out into the open, and explains that her father has been abducted and that she needs their help to find him.\n\nJust as Ben agrees to help her, the insect like chips suddenly spring to life and attack, while the group sees that they are being controlled by a man on a catwalk. Kevin sees it as a double cross, though Elena insists that she is not responsible. While the dealers escape, Ben gets far enough from the chips to allow him to transform into Big Chill and fight off the swarm of flying chips along with Gwen and Kevin until the man in the rafters escapes. Elena escapes in the confusion, further justifying Kevin's suspicions. Though Gwen quickly sides with Kevin, Ben is not as easily convinced.\n\nArriving at their headquarters underneath the Bellwood auto repair shop, the trio, along with Grandpa Max, study one of the chips salvaged after fighting the swarm, learning that they are Techno-organic material/a hybrid of organic and technological components. Elena, having followed the trio, breaks in and Max orders her to leave, explaining that Elena's father, Victor Validus, was an apprentice of his who was dishonorably discharged after stealing the original chips. Ben refuses to believe that Elena is like her father, and breaks ranks with his grandfather and teammates to help her.\n\nWhile Max is away, Gwen and Kevin hack into the computer files relating to Victor Validus and discover a video of Max interrogating Victor, in which Victor insists that \"the Hive\", the hive mind intelligence behind the chips, is coming to take over the planet, the chips being revealed to be able to enter and possess people. It is revealed that Victor stole the chips to further research them because he realized that they were a threat, as well as that they were dormant instead of dead, as the Plumbers believed. Realizing that Max's anger towards Victor's betrayal may be clouding his judgement, Gwen and Kevin decide to aid Ben as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben and Elena arrive at Victor's old laboratory. It has been cleared out by the Hive, but they left Ship-It order slips behind. Other discarded files indicate that Victor was studying and upgrading the chips. Elena reveals that her father became erratic and he stopped returning home. He also appears to be the man from the rafters controlling the chips. A mob under the control of the chips ambush Ben and Elena, forcing them to retreat. The Omnitrix again experiences interference around the chips and keeps Ben from transforming around them, but Ben utilizes a scanning function on it to temporarily repel the mob and allow him and Elena to escape. They head to the Ship-It building to investigate further, though Ben is now somewhat suspicious of Elena himself, realizing the mob expected him and Elena to go to the lab and set a trap for them. Ben finds an order slip made out for that day, when Elena claimed that Victor had already been missing for weeks.\n\nGwen and Kevin, having reached the building first, are too late to stop the distribution of the chips. Instead, they are met by one of the Ship-It employees, who is also under the chips' control. He summons another larger chip swarm, now capable of forming solid, weaponizable shapes, to attack Gwen and Kevin, which eventually wreck Kevin's car (a modified Dodge Challenger) during a lengthy chase. Ben, overhearing the commotion and following them, uses Humongousaur (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) to defeat the swarm, completely demolishing Kevin's car in the process.\n\nBy the time they return to headquarters, the chips have spread across the globe, and number in the millions. Gwen realizes the swarm's new ability is a sign that they can adapt to threats and become smarter. The group also deduces the chips have a queen (voiced by Wendy Cutler), as the chip's hosts have mentioned her. They believed that they can stop the chips by destroying her, but during their search for the Queen, one of the active chips they were studying possesses Max and leaves with him. Pulling together, the group notice that while world population centers are all infected, the relatively remote Barren Rock, Missouri, has the highest concentration, an apparent anomaly in their distribution. The town is home to the central headquarters of Ship-It. With Kevin's car out of commission, Kevin reveals that he has built a black and green car for Ben (a heavily modified Mazda RX-8), called DX Mark 10 (confirmed by Bandai and Dwayne McDuffie) as a \"late birthday present.\"\n\nInfiltrating the factory, populated by multiple infected, including Max, the group discovers that the Queen infected Elena's father, and his body is being used as a hive to rapidly mass-produce the chips. Possessed by the Queen, Victor is also the man from the mill controlling the chips. Elena admits that she knew her father was infected, but didn't tell them because she feared they would believe she betrayed them, just as the Plumbers did to Victor. Gwen and Kevin reluctantly suggest killing Victor to stop the Hive, but Elena and Ben refuse to consider it. Fearing being possessed by the chips while in his alien forms, Ben uses the Omnitrix to transform into a new alien that he calls \"Nanomech\" (voiced by the film's director Alex Winter), which was created by scanning the DNA of the chips, with Ben realizing that this was the cause of the apparent interference in the Omnitrix. He flies into Victor's head and battles the Queen, who briefly tries to assert her hive mind on him while he resists, while Gwen, Kevin, and Elena fight the infected. As the dormant chips in the factory begin to activate, Nanomech uses the chips ability to adapt to overwhelm and destroy the Queen, and all of the other chips, freeing everybody from their control.\n\nIn the aftermath, Max, after personally apologizing to Victor, decides to retire and leave his position as leader to Ben, but Ben refuses to allow him to do so. The film ends as Ben, Gwen, Kevin, and Elena drive home.\n\nMajor hurdles for film's initial production stage included the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike as well as the threat of strikes by other guilds. Prior to a potential Directors Guild of America strike, Winter began creating animatics of action sequences featuring characters rejected for the 2007 film. This would allow animators to complete sequences if the Directors Guild of America went on strike in January 2008, which ultimately did not happen. Winter considered making a small project in between \"Ben 10\" and its sequel, but decided against the idea, saying \"you have your baby and you don't want someone else to take it\".\n\nInspired by its use in Sam Raimi's \"Spider-Man\", three action sequences in \"Ben 10: Alien Swarm\" were shot using IMAX cameras. Although screenwriters John Turman and James Krieg suggested that the IMAX footage would be 3D, Winter late said he found 3D too gimmicky. Winter added that shooting in IMAX was easier than using stereoscopic cameras.\n\nCartoon Network became more involved in the designs of the aliens than the company was for \"Ben 10\". The company along with Boomerang, suggested to the filmmakers that combining aliens be the main draw for the sequel.\n\nThe score to \"Ben 10: Alien Swarm\" was composed by Michael Wandmacher, who reunited with director Alex Winter to record his score with a 71-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage. The song \"A Little Faster\" by There For Tomorrow appears in the film.\n\nIn December 2009, Warner Bros. Pictures and Cartoon Network are reportedly interested in fast-tracking a third \"Ben 10\" film due to the second film's success. However, such plans have yet to be seen.\n"}

The prize is named after the Diagram Group, an information and graphics company based in London, and \"The Bookseller\", a British trade magazine for the publishing industry. Originally organised to provide entertainment during the 1978 Frankfurt Book Fair, the prize has since been awarded every year by \"The Bookseller\" and is now organised by the magazine's diarist Horace Bent. The winner was initially decided by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner has been decided by a public vote on \"The Bookseller\"′s website.\n\nControversy has arisen since the creation of the awards; there have been two occasions when no award was given because no titles were judged to be odd enough, Bent has complained about some of the winners chosen by the public, and the 2008 winner, \"The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais\", proved controversial because rather than being written by its listed author, Philip M. Parker, it was instead written by a machine of Parker's invention. The most recent winner, in November 2018, was \"Joy of Waterboiling\" by Asche Verlag.\n\nAlthough the award was created by \"The Bookseller\", the idea of an award celebrating books with odd titles was proposed by Bruce Robinson and Trevor Bounford of the Diagram Group in order to provide entertainment during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978. Originally known as the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, any book that was at the fair could be nominated, but other books outside of the fair were also included. In 1982, Horace Bent, diarist for \"The Bookseller\", took over administrative duties. Following two occasions in 1987 and 1991 when no prize was given due to a lack of odd titles, \"The Bookseller\" opened suggestions to the readers of the magazine. In 2000, the winner was voted for by the public instead of being decided by Bent. In 2009, online submissions sent on Twitter were accepted. This resulted in the highest number of submissions for the prize in its history, with 90 books being submitted (50 from Twitter), almost three times the number from the previous year (32). However, Bent also expressed his annoyance at people who gave submissions that broke the rules, with some of the books mentioned being published as far back as 1880. The 2014 prize allowed nominations from self-published works, the first book being \"Strangers Have the Best Candy\" by Margaret Meps Schulte, which won the prize.\n\nThe Diagram Prize receives considerable press coverage every year. In 2008, more people voted for the Diagram Prize (8,500 votes) than The Best of Booker Prize (7,800). The prize is either a magnum of champagne or a bottle of claret for the person who nominates the winning title, and increased publicity for both the book and its author. In 2014, the nominator was Brian Payne, who works as the deputy chief sub-editor of \"The Bookseller\". Due to his position he decided to reject the bottle of claret that he won saying it, \"would remain in the cellar.\" In 2018, all the nominations came from staff at \"The Bookseller\", so the claret will be awarded to a random voter who votes for the eventual winner.\n\nNominees were originally limited to just books at the Frankfurt Book Fair, but this was extended to submissions sent in by \"The Bookseller\" magazine's traditional readership of librarians, publishers, and booksellers in order to decrease the risk of no award being given. In 2009, submissions could be sent to either Bent's or \"The Bookseller's\" Twitter accounts. People cannot nominate their own works, nor can they select books they publish themselves. Titles that are deliberately created to be funny are normally rejected. Also, nominators, judges and voters are actively discouraged from reading any of the nominations, \"for fear that becoming too close to the work may cloud their judgement in declaring the text's title 'odd'. Especially considering the prize champions 'odd titles' and \"not\" 'odd books' (see the Man Booker for the latter)\". The winner was originally voted for by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner has been voted for by members of the public via the Internet. Bent resisted this move and threatened to resign, but he later reconsidered and now creates the short list of finalists. Also, the title of the book must be in English, although the langauge in the book can be any language.\n\nIn September 2008, a book about the Diagram Prize was published by Aurum Press entitled \"How to Avoid Huge Ships and Other Implausibly Titled Books\". With an introduction written by Joel Rickett, the book was released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the prize. It featured a collection of book covers from winners and runners-up from previous years. A follow-up book was released in October 2009, entitled \"Baboon Metaphysics And More Implausibly Titled Books\", including an introduction by Bent.\n\nSo far, there have been two occasions in which no award has been presented. Bent did not offer a prize in 1987 and 1991, as he felt there was no title that was odd enough to deserve the prize. The prize has become noteworthy enough that, in 2004, \"The Bookseller\" castigated publishers for choosing titles with a view to winning it, saying, \"There were too many self-consciously titled entries – presumably in a bid to emulate the 2003 champion, \"Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories\"\". Bent has also expressed his dislike of people voting for ruder titles, stating that he himself would not have voted for the 2007 winner \"If You Want Closure in Your Relationship, Start with Your Legs\".\n\nIn 2009, the choice of \"The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais\" as winner of the 2008 award was controversial, as Parker did not write the book himself, but used an automated authoring machine which produces thousands of titles on the basis of Internet and database searches. Philip Stone, charts editor and awards administrator at \"The Bookseller\", commented by saying: \"I think it's slightly controversial as it was written by a computer, but given the number of celebrity memoirs out there that are ghostwritten, I don't think it's too strange.\"\n\nIn 2018, one of the nominations, \"Joy of Waterboiling\", was controversial because the book was written mostly in German, but the rules of the prize state that only the title needs to be in English in order to qualify for nomination.\n\nTwo special anniversary awards known as the \"Diagram of Diagrams\" (the name reflects the \"Booker of Bookers\") have been presented to honour both the 15th and the 30th anniversaries of the Diagram Prize. The nominations of the prizes were all of the previous winners up to that point in time. In 1993, the winner of the 15th anniversary award was \"Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice\", the winner of the first Diagram Prize. The second \"Diagram of Diagrams\", announced on 5 September 2008, was \"Greek Rural Postmen and Their Cancellation Numbers\", the 1996 winner.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2722292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2722292", "title": "Call of Duty 3", "text": "Call of Duty 3\n\nCall of Duty 3 is a 2006 first-person shooter video game developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. It is the third major installment in the \"Call of Duty\" series. It was released for PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It was a launch title for the PlayStation 3 and Wii in North America, Europe and Australia.\n\nThe single player is modeled after the Normandy breakout, where the British, Canadian, Polish, American, and French Resistance forces pushed into the village of Chambois, France, also known as the Falaise Gap. Unlike most other games in the \"Call of Duty\" series, the events in \"Call of Duty 3\" are based on a single combined campaign, with the player being switched between the four armed forces – U.S. Army, British SAS, Canadian Army, and the Polish 1st Armoured Division – and their respective characters for each leg of the story. There are 14 campaign missions in total, with cinematics to link between each one. Each mission also contains various action sequences where players have to input button commands, whether arming a bomb, or fighting off a melee ambush. In addition, some missions also include multiple choices in routes to completing an objective.\n\nIn addition to the single-player campaign, \"Call of Duty 3\" features a wide range of multiplayer modes for players to participate in – each team allowing up to 24 on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, and 16 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in a single match. This is only in the online mode. All team game modes feature the soldiers of the Allied nations versus those of the Axis. Multiplayer features are absent from the Wii edition.\n\nIt is the first game in the \"Call of Duty\" series to introduce two different game modes. The \"Normalized\" mode was added to allow console players a way to adjust to the smaller kill box of \"Call of Duty\", its expansion \"United Offensive\", and \"Call of Duty 2\".\n\nOn the Xbox 360, \"Call of Duty 3\" divides its multiplayer aspect into Player and Ranked matches. Player matches allow players to invite other players into their games, but do not contribute points toward the leader board or unlock Achievements. Ranked matches put the player with and against teams of random players, and contribute towards player points and allow players to unlock Achievements.\n\nThe American campaign begins with Private Nichols banded with Corporal Mike Dixon, Private Leroy Huxley (voiced by Benjamin Diskin), the radio op Private First Class Salvatore Guzzo and the squad's CO, Sergeant Frank McCullin in the 29th Infantry Division. After the capture of Saint-Lô, the squad is folded with the 90th Infantry Division to secure Saint-Germain-sur-Sèves. The 90th then assaults Mayenne in order to capture its fortified bridge. McCullin succeeds in defusing the bombs rigged on the bridge at the cost of his life. Dixon assumes command of the squad and leads them to clear out Forêt d'Écouves, to aid the 2nd battalion. The squad then liberates the suburbs to secure a vital crossroads, which helps ensure the success of the Falaise Gap plan, now that the other Allied forces have finished in the north.\n\nNichols unit is then defending the town of Chambois from German forces trying to escape through the Falaise Gap. After much retreating and fighting, Dixon is killed and Guzzo leads the squad, aiding the Baker Company to retake the town and force the German resistance to surrender. Two days later, the squad members receive promotions and begin their march to liberate Paris.\n\nIn the British and French campaign, the player controls Sergeant James Doyle working alongside SAS members, Corporal Keith, and Major Ingram. The SAS have a rough parachute drop into France, where they link up with the Maquis Resistance, including their leader Pierre LaRoche, Isabelle DuFontaine, and a man only known as Marcel. They begin attacking a German AA position, followed by the destruction of a fuel plant. Ingram is captured, but the SAS and Maquis are able to rescue him from the outskirts of a village, along with several Resistance fighters bound for execution. Isabelle is killed as she plants a satchel charge on an armored car. The SAS and Maquis then team up to take the fight into the rest of Europe.\n\nIn the Canadian campaign the player controls Private Cole of the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division, led by World War I veteran Lieutenant Jean-Guy Robichaud. Robichaud commands a platoon in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, aided by Sergeant Jonathan Callard, squad member Pvt, Peterson, and the squad's radio operator, Pvt. Leslie Baron. The platoon attacks a German-held ridge in a night-time operation, then capture an industrial area and holding off a counter-attack. The platoon proceeds to clears a forest near the Laison River of several anti-tank positions and a motor pool. Baron is transferred to a Polish armored unit. Robichaud leads his unit to rescue a captured Canadian tank crew and with their help they capture the whole town. Callard is killed as he blows himself up along with a King Tiger tank. The unit then soon start helping to move more Canadian reinforcements through the town to aid the Polish struggling to defend Hill 262.\n\nThe Polish campaign revolves around Cpl. \"Bohater\" Wojciech, a Sherman Firefly tank driver in the Polish 1st Armored Division hunting more German tanks in revenge to the occupation of the homeland of his crew members, including Major Jachowicz, Corporal Rudinski, Sergeant Kowalski and Pte. Ulan. While aiding the Canadian and British forces in the area, Jachowicz's crew participates in a sweep across the French countryside, engaging German armor. Bohater and the rest of his tank crew eventually track down and destroy an infamous Tiger II tank. The Poles then capture Hill 262 and endure a heavy assault by the remnants of the German 7th Army desperate to escape the Falaise Pocket. With their position overrun, Bohater and his crew continue to fight the Germans with Rudinski and Kowalski getting killed and later. They are joined by Canadian radio operator Baron, who is killed in the ensuing battle. After much fighting, the Royal Canadian Air Force repels the German invaders and Hill 262 is firmly in Allied hands.\n\nThree map packs were released for the Xbox 360 multiplayer game on the Xbox Live Marketplace. The first, \"Champs\", was released as a free download on January 11, 2007 and contained a single self-titled map. The \"Valor\" map pack contained five new maps: Crossing, Ironclad, La Bourgade, Stalag 23, and Wildwood. The pack was released on January 27, 2007 for 800 MP ($10). The final map pack, \"Bravo\", contained five new maps of which two were remade from \"\": Gare Centrale, Marseilles, Aller Haut, Seine River, and Rimling. The pack was released on May 31, 2007 for 800 MP. The price of the map packs was later reduced to 400 MP ($5) each.\n\n\"Call of Duty 3\" was unveiled by Activision shortly before E3 2006. It was revealed that Treyarch would be developing the title (their second in the series after \"\") which was set to release later that year. The game would be running on Treyarch's own internal engine, NGL. This game served as a launch title for the PlayStation 3 and Wii in North America, Europe and Australia. It was also the only major \"Call of Duty\" installment not to be released for personal computer platforms (though ports were planned yet cancelled) and the only numerical sequel to date to have been a console-exclusive game alongside \"Big Red One\" and \"\". \n\nIn an interview with Video Gamer, \"\" senior producer, Noah Heller, revealed the team had eight months to develop \"Call of Duty 3\".\n\n\"Call of Duty 3\" had generally favorable reviews, with the Xbox release holding a 83 out of 100 score on Metacritic, while the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 hold 82 out of 100, and the PlayStation 3 with 80 out of 100. The Wii release was viewed much less favorably, with a score of 69 out of 100. IGN gave a score of 8.8, while GameSpot gave an 8.2. The game won various awards from publications for best shooter and sound design. Institutes such as The Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences awarded the game for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design in 2007.\n\nUpon release, \"Call of Duty 3\" was one of the best selling titles of November 2006 in the United States. The game debuted at #3 on UK charts and dropped off the top 10 list by February 2007. By the end of 2006, the game had sold approximately 1.1 million units in the US according to NPD Group. By February 3, 2007 total sales in the United States were 2 million units. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 releases of \"Call of Duty 3\" each received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies per version in the United Kingdom. By November 2013, the game had sold 7.2 million copies worldwide.\n\n"}

Its purpose was to develop and implement means of improving the education of music teachers. In 1967 a symposium was held at Airlie House (a conference center) in Warrenton, Virginia to discuss means of evaluating comprehensive musicianship. The resultant document, \"Procedures for Evaluation of Music in Contemporary Education\", offers guidelines for the evaluation of techniques and attitudes acquired through comprehensive musicianship studies.\n\nThere are two curricula that are examples of the Comprehensive Musicianship methodology: The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program and the Hawaii Music Curriculum Program.\n\nThe Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program (MMCP) was funded by a grant from the U.S. Dept. of Education and was named for Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York. Its objectives were to develop a music curriculum and related materials for a sequential music learning program for the primary grades through high school. The project produced the \"Synthesis\", a comprehensive curriculum for grades 3 through 12, \"Interaction\", an early childhood curriculum, and three feasibility studies: The Electronic Keyboard Laboratory, the Science-Music Program, and the Instrumental Program.\n\nMMCP began in 1965 with an exploratory of 92 innovative and experimental music programs. Phase One (1966) dealt with perspectives of student learning potentials, problems of curriculum reform, and classroom procedures. Phase Two (1967) dealt with the refinement and synthesis of information gained in the first exploratory period and the organization of information into a feasible curriculum. Phase Three (1968) consisted of the refinement and field testing of all curriculum items, the initial investigation of a separate curriculum for early childhood, the preparation and testing of plans for teacher retraining, and the development of an assessment instrument that reflected the program objectives.\n\nThe Hawaii Music Curriculum Program began in 1968 under the sponsorship of the Hawaii Curriculum Center in Honolulu. Its purpose was to create a logical, continuous educational program ensuring the competent guidance of the music education of all children in the state's public schools and to test and assemble the materials needed by schools to realize this program. Students are to be involved with music in school in the same ways that people are involved with music in the outside world. The curriculum is based on seven basic concepts: tone, rhythm, melody, harmony, form, tonality, and texture, that are presented in the form of a spiral curriculum. The taxonomy of concepts was translated into a curriculum by means of division into five \"zones.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2899086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2899086", "title": "Contemporary ballet", "text": "Contemporary ballet\n\nContemporary ballet is a genre of dance that incorporates elements of classical ballet and modern dance. It employs classical ballet technique and in many cases classical pointe technique as well, but allows greater range of movement of the upper body and is not constrained to the rigorously defined body lines and forms found in traditional, classical ballet. Many of its attributes come from the ideas and innovations of 20th-century modern dance, including floor work and turn-in of the legs.\n\nGeorge Balanchine is often considered to have been the first pioneer of contemporary ballet. However, the true origin of contemporary ballet is credited to Russian art producer Serge Diaghilev. Diaghilev wanted to bring an understanding of the arts to the general public. He created a program that combined all forms of the arts (painting, music, theater, and art) to present to the public. When this program had success in Russia, Diaghilev was inspired to bring it to a European audience by creating a new spin on classical ballet. He created Diaghilev's Russian Ballet Company, debuting the first show in 1909. However, Diaghilev was not a choreographer, he entrusted the evolvement of his creation to several well-known choreographers, one of them being George Balanchine. \n\nThe style of dance Balanchine developed, which lies between classical ballet and today's contemporary ballet, is known by today's standards as neoclassical ballet. He used flexed hands (and occasionally feet), turned-in legs, off-centered positions and non-traditional costumes, such as leotards, tunics and \"powder puff\" tutus instead of \"pancake\" tutus, to distance his work from the classical and romantic ballet traditions. Balanchine invited modern dance performers such as Paul Taylor in to dance with his company, the New York City Ballet, and he worked with modern dance choreographer Martha Graham, which expanded his exposure to modern techniques and ideas. During this period, other choreographers such as John Butler and Glen Tetley began to consciously combine ballet and modern techniques in experimentation.\n\nOne dancer who trained with Balanchine and absorbed much of this neoclassical style was Mikhail Baryshnikov. Following Baryshnikov's appointment as artistic director of the American Ballet Theatre in 1980, he worked with various modern choreographers, most notably Twyla Tharp. Tharp choreographed \"Push Comes To Shove\" for ABT and Baryshnikov in 1976; in 1986 she created \"In The Upper Room\" for her own company. Both of these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers—for their use of contemporary ballet.\n\nTharp also worked with The Joffrey Ballet, founded in 1957 by Robert Joffrey. She choreographed \"Deuce Coupe\" for them in 1973, using pop music and a blend of modern and ballet techniques. The Joffrey Ballet continued to perform numerous contemporary pieces, many choreographed by co-founder Gerald Arpino.\n\nOther notable contemporary choreographers include Jorma Elo, William Forsythe (choreographer), Mark Morris (choreographer), Jiri Kylian, Alonzo King, and Trey McIntyre.\n\nContemporary ballet draws from both modern dance and classical ballet for its training methods and technique. For a dancer to be able to embody various styles the training regimen has become more diverse. In addition to classical technique, which often includes the signature speed and style of George Balanchine for American dancers, dancers study modern as well. In addition, many dancers do various forms of cross training. Pilates and yoga are often included to loosen muscles and align the body. Since the late 1920s, Pilates has been a popular form of cross training to help prevent injury, but increasingly, the Gyrotonic Expansion System is being utilized. With contemporary work, dancers' spines need to be more supple and they need to understand how to be grounded. This is in contrast to classical and neoclassical ballet where the dancers are required to \"pull up\" and the upper body is held. Dancers are required to first obtain classical ballet training in order to build on it with more modern technique in order to be more versatile. Despite formal training, dancers are often affected by ankle injuries, due to the high intensity footwork.\n\nThe costumes and footwear differ from any other style of dance as well. In contemporary ballet, dancers can be asked to wear pointe shoes, regular ballet shoes, or even no shoes at all. The same versatile approach goes for the music, setting, and costumes. Contemporary ballet does not require certain standards to be met. While it has more guidelines that modern dance, it does not conform to the limits of classical ballet. Classical ballet requires tutus, pointe shoes and scenery. Contemporary ballet uses different types of costumes, ranging from traditional to more modern tunic type versions. The music choices may vary as well. In Classical ballet, most often the choreography is done to classical music. In contemporary ballet, the music can range from the traditional classical music to popular music of today.\n\nToday there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers all over the world. Notable companies include Nederlands Dans Theater, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, Complexions Contemporary Ballet, and Alonzo King LINES Ballet. Likewise, many traditionally \"classical\" companies also regularly perform contemporary works. Most classically trained dancers who may identify as professional ballet dancers are in fact required to be very versatile and able to perform work ranging from classical to neoclassical to contemporary ballet to modern dance. They are required to have impeccable ballet technique with a mastery of pointe technique for women, but at the same time, are being asked to be just as comfortable in ballet slippers or bare foot performing the work of modern choreographers such as Paul Taylor (choreographer) or embracing Gaga (dance vocabulary) in the work of Ohad Naharin. It is very common for ballet companies to have an official choreographer in residence to create new work—often contemporary—on the company. As well, many contemporary choreographers are commissioned to go to companies to create new work or a company will pay for the rights to perform already existing work and an official repetiteur will come to stage it. Twyla Tharp, as previously mentioned, is a highly renowned choreographer whose work is widely performed.\n\n"}

The bride refers to herself as Kennedy, and the film flashes back to the previous day, to when Kennedy, her fiancé Ryan, Kennedy's half-sister Hannah, their friend Emily, Ryan's cousin Derrick, and Ryan's friend Chet travelled to a secluded cabin for a Stag and doe party.\n\nAs the characters set up at the cabin, it is revealed that almost all of them have a dark secret; Kennedy's unspecified mental illness is flaring up due to wedding-related stress, Ryan is having an affair with Hannah, Derrick intends to extort Kennedy through Ryan in order to get the money he owes a drug dealer, and the caretaker, Bo, is the prime suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Susan. That night, while everyone else is participating in a scavenger hunt, Derrick is murdered with an axe. Upon noticing that Derrick is missing, the others go to look for him, and become separated, with Kennedy and Ryan finding Derrick's corpse, and Emily presumably being murdered after she, Chet, and Hannah encounter Bo, who has the axe that was used to kill Derrick. The remaining partiers regroup at the cabin, and discover that the power has been cut, the vehicle has been sabotaged, and that all of the cellular phones have been thrown into the stove. Chet then goes missing, Bo is found dying from a head wound, and Hannah is knifed by someone wearing a burlap sack as a mask. Kennedy stumbles onto Emily and Chet's bodies, and then Hannah's, which Ryan is with. Thinking Ryan is the killer, Kennedy attacks him, and runs off.\n\nAt dawn, Ryan returns to the cabin, where he and Kennedy fight, ending with Kennedy stabbing Ryan to death after Ryan spitefully declares that he never loved her. Kennedy then goes into hysterics, puts on her wedding dress, and runs into Emily, who claims that she had only been injured, and had faked being dead. The two women begin to walk to safety, until Emily lets slip information that only the killer could know. Kennedy confronts Emily, who asserts that she slew Derrick and Hannah, and had intended to murder Ryan, to protect her, with Chet and Bo being collateral damage. Kennedy snaps, and strangles Emily.\n\nThe film returns to the intro, and the bride lifts her veil to reveal that she is Emily, who had recovered, bludgeoned Kennedy, and taken her gown. The ranger offers his condolences for all that \"Kennedy\" has gone through, and when he gives Emily a pen to write down who he should contact for her, she stabs him in the neck with it, and walks out into the woods, leaving her fate unknown.\n\nNav Qateel of \"1nflux Magazine\" said that, while \"Death Do Us Part\" had its shortcomings, it was still something \"I wouldn't hesitate recommending to anyone into horror\". A lukewarn review was given was by Christian Bates-Hardy of Rock! Shock! Pop!, who concluded, \"\"Death Do Us Part\" does a fairly good job of building tension up between the characters and establishing subplots and drama between them, but once it becomes a horror film the whole thing unravels and quickly becomes a directionless mess. The characters do a lot of pointless running around and screaming for no apparent reason, and it becomes very tedious until the last ten to fifteen minutes. I was ready to divorce this movie until the final twist was revealed. The ending has a surprisingly nasty edge that somewhat redeems the movie, but doesn't quite make up for the lack of direction and poor script\". In his coverage of \"Death Do Us Part\" for the Canadian Film Review, Mark Weeden called the picture a hackneyed affair that was devoid of fright, but full of boring kills, cringe-worthy attempts at emotion, and \"Huh?\"-inducing plot developments. DVD Verdict's Patrick Bromley wrote that the \"totally forgettable\" \"Death Do Us Part\" is \"the most frustrating kind of horror movie: the kind that strives only for mediocrity and achieves it\".\n"}

The movement to include children and youth with disabilities into mainstream society has led to new approaches on the part of authors, as well as educators.\n\nIn the United States, 10% of the population has a physical, cognitive, mental or health disability, a rate that is consistent worldwide. Disabilities may also include sensory or learning difficulties, and may range from severe to mild. The approach of children and youth literature (collectively called \"juvenile literature\") can have a significant impact on the children reading it, whether they personally have experienced disability or not; literature \"has proven to be an agent capable of influencing attitudes and acceptance of impairments\". \n\nFrom 1940 to 1970, around 311 books for children were published in the United States that included characters with disabilities. Some of these books romanticized the disability, some were infantilized, while others portrayed the disabled characters as avoiding the world. One example is the classic children's book \"Heidi\". It portrays the character Clara as a spoiled and insulated child, who regains the ability to walk after befriending Heidi and overcoming a vague and unexplained psychological problem, the apparent cause of her physical paralysis, which in reality would be medically unlikely. Another oddity is that the portrayal of blind individuals was in excess of their actual numbers in the real population. Blindness was noted as being the most common disability among African-American characters in children's fiction, used as a plot device to represent the ability to see beyond racial prejudices, making the disability secondary to its significance as a plot device.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, the United States Congress passed several Acts to legally protect the right of children and adults with disabilities to be included in schools and the workforce, first with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and then the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975. In 1986, the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) was put into force in the United States, which ended the exclusion of children with disabilities from publicly funded school systems. With the integration of children with disabilities into public schools, educators, librarians and publishers took a new interest in children's literature that dealt with disability in a balanced, accurate, and constructive way. An overall growth in public awareness of disability and its portrayal in media has supported a trend towards more detailed medical descriptions of conditions in juvenile literature. Barbara Holland Baskin and Karen H. Harris conducted influential research into the portrayal of disability in children and youth literature in the late 1970s. They published the seminal study \"Notes from a Different Drummer\" (1977), followed by \"More Notes from a Different Drummer\" (1984). Today, disability in juvenile literature is a standard topic included in bibliographies, research, criticism, and review sources. Several bibliographies and studies reviewing fiction and non-fiction have been produced in the years since.\n\nThe evolution of the portrayal of disability can be seen in the books written since the 1970s. Judy Blume shows the experience of a teenage girl diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis in \"Deenie\" (1973). The protagonist, Deenie, faces the challenges brought by having to wear a body brace during her treatment, which impacts her perceptions of herself and those of her family and fellow students. Deenie does not overcome the disability by the end of the story, nor is she defeated by it; the conclusion more realistically shows her continuing to face challenges and learning to adjust to them. \n\nA trend in current juvenile fiction is the portrayal of characters with \"hidden disabilities\" that have become more common diagnoses in recent decades. Examples include Petra Mathers' \"Sophie and Lou\", about extreme shyness that is an emotional and social disability, and Caroline Janover's \"The Worst Speller in Jr. High\" (1995) about a boy with dyslexia. In fiction for older youth, disability has recently been dealt with in complex situations with nuanced techniques such as multiple-perspective narrative; an example is Erika Tamar's \"Fair Game\" (1993), about a group of male students who repeatedly sexually assault an intellectually disabled girl at their school. \n\nBibliographer Debra Robertson, who wrote \"Portraying Persons with Disabilities: An Annotated Bibliography of Fiction for Children and Teenagers\" (1992), pointed out in the early 1990s that not every disability has to be a \"metaphor for a protagonist's development\", and the tendency of writers to romanticize or stigmatize medical conditions in this way is a persistent problem in juvenile literature. \n\nMore recent studies have indicated that educators may improve student understanding of disability with \"follow-up discussion or activities and stories that portray characters with disabilities accurately, realistically, and positively\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2176941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2176941", "title": "Funaná", "text": "Funaná\n\nThe funaná is a music and dance genre from Cape Verde. \"Funaná\" is an accordion-based music. It is perhaps the most upbeat form of Cape Verdean music. The rhythm is usually provided by the ferrinho much like the use of washboards in zydeco, the saw in Caribbean ripsaw music, the scraper in Sub-Saharan African music and the güiro in Latin and Pre-Columbian music.\n\nAs a music genre, the \"funaná\" is characterized by having a variable tempo, from \"vivace\" to \"andante\", and a 2-beat rhythm. The \"funaná\" is intimately associated to the accordion, more precisely to the diatonic accordion, commonly known as gaita in Cape Verde. This influences a lot of musical aspects that characterize the \"funaná\", such as the fact that, in its most traditional form, the funaná uses only diatonic scales, and not chromatic ones.\n\nThe structure of a \"funaná\" composition is not very different from the structure of other musical genres in Cape Verde, i.e., basically the music is structured through a set of main strophes that alternate with a refrain. The main difference is that between the different strophes and the refrain there is a solo played on the accordion. The music is generally monotonic.\n\nThe accompaniment is made with the left hand on the accordion, providing a bass and the chords. The rhythmic model is played on the \"ferrinho\".\n\nThe melodic line of the \"funaná\" varies a lot through the composition, with a lot of series of ascending and descending notes. The \"funaná\" singers occasionally use the \"sforzando\" technique in certain notes, specially if they are long (imitation of the accordion?).\n\nThe lyrics of the \"funaná\" generally talk about everyday situations, mentioning the sorrows and the happiness of quotidian life, but they also talk about social criticism, reflections about life and idyllic situations. Recent composers however have expanded the themes. Another characteristic of \"funaná\" is that the lyrics are not made in a direct way, but frequently use figures of speech, proverbs and popular sayings. Example:\n\nThat requires a good knowledge of popular culture and language, and that’s why recent compositions, compositions from younger authors or compositions from authors with little contact with popular culture do not always use this poetry technique.\n\nConcerning instrumentation, in its most traditional form, of the \"funaná\" only uses the accordion and the \"ferrinho\". With the stylization and electrification other instruments are used: the rhythm provided by the \"ferrinho\" is made on a drum set together with other percussion instruments (a shaker or a cabasa); the bass/accompaniment played on the accordion is replaced by a bass guitar and an electric guitar; the melody played on the accordion is replaced by a synthesizer. By the end of the 90’s, there is a certain revival where the unplugged (acoustic) performances are sought after, in which electronic instruments are relegated in favor to authentic accordions and \"ferrinhos\".\n\nAs a dance, \"funaná\" is a couple dance, with the partners embracing each other with an arm while with the other arm they hold on the hands together. The dance is made through alternated quick and strong inflexions of each knee, marking the beats of the rhythm. In the more rural way of dancing, the bodies are slightly inclined to the front (having shoulder contact), and the feet lift off the ground. In the more urban way of dancing, more stylized, the bodies are more vertical (having chest contact), and the feet drag on the ground.\n\nThe \"funaná\" is a relatively recent musical genre. According to the oral tradition, the \"funaná\" appeared when, in an attempt of acculturation, the accordion would have been introduced in Santiago island in the beginning of the 20th century, in order to the population to learn Portuguese musical genres. The result, however, would have been completely different: it would be the creation of a new and genuine music genre. There aren’t, nevertheless, musicological documents to prove that. Even so, it’s still curious the fact that, even being a totally different musical genre, the usage of the accordion and the ferrinho in the \"funaná\" is analogous to the usage of the accordion and the triangle in certain Portuguese folk music genres (malhão, corridinho, vira, etc.)\n\nOther sources, also from oral tradition, trace back another origin. They place the origins of the \"funaná\" in the increase of accordion importations as a cheap substitute for organs to play religious music. The \"funaná\" would have then appeared as an adaptation for the accordion of other musical genres that were in vogue then.\n\nThe name “\"funaná\"” itself is also recent, and dates back probably from the 60’s and 70’s. For some, the word derives from the Portuguese word “\"fungagá\"”. For others the name comes from the merging of the names of two great players, one of accordion and the other of \"ferrinho\", named Funa and Naná. The older words for designating the \"funaná\" were “\"fuc-fuc\"” and “\"badju l’ gaita\"”.\n\nInitially a genre exclusively from Santiago, for a long time the \"funaná\" was relegated to a rural context and/or for the less favourished social classes. It has even been forbidden its performance in the capital, where it was the \"morna\" that had a more prestigious and noble character.\n\nBut during the 1970s, and mostly after the independence, there had been essays of reviving certain musical genres, among them the \"funaná\". The post-independence socialist ideology, with its struggle against the social classes differences, was a fertile field for the (re)birth of the \"funaná\". These essays weren’t successful mostly because “the \"funaná\" couldn’t step away from the \"coladeira\"”.\n\nIt was necessary to wait for the 1980s in order the band Bulimundo and specially its mentor Carlos Alberto Martins (a.k.a. Catchás) make a true revival of the \"funaná\". Going to “drink” directly to the source (inner Santiago island), Catchás profited his jazz and classical music knowledge to make up a new style of playing the \"funaná\", leaning in electric and electronic instruments, that would influence nearly all artists from now on. Thanks to the success of Bulimundo, the \"funaná\" was exported to all the islands in Cape Verde. Today, the \"funaná\" is no longer seen as a genre exclusively from Santiago, being composed, performed and appreciated by people from all the islands.\n\nIf the 80’s were the years of the spreading of the \"funaná\" within Cape Verde, the 90’s were the years of the internationalization. The band Finaçon, born from a split of the band Bulimundo, was one of the responsible for the internationalization of this genre, thanks to a contract with a renowned foreign record label. Not only the \"funaná\" had become known internationally, but it is also performed by musical bands abroad, being cape verdean bands or not.\n\nConcerning musical techniques there are no big innovations to the “Catchás’ style”, maybe perhaps only regarding the instrumentation (the possibilities of electronic instruments are explored). We can also notice, in this period, the excessive commercialization and banalization of the \"funaná\". For instance, during a certain year, there has been an attempt of disclosing the \"funaná\" in France. That attempt was not successful because \"funaná\" was sold as a kind of “summer in-vogue music” (right after the lambada), and not exploring the ethno-musical particularities of the \"funaná\".\n\nBy the end of the 90’s, we can assist to a return to the roots, where the bands prefer to perform with authentic accordions and \"ferrinhos\" (occasionally a bass, a drum set and/or a guitar is added). One of the leading bands of this new vague is the band Ferro Gaita.\n\nThe \"funaná\" has several variants, not all of them well known and not all of them known by its true name. Here is the description of some:\n\nThis is the most known variant of the \"funaná\". Generally when the word “\"funaná\"” is used alone it refers to this variant which is the one that is more successful, specially in dancing. It is a variant that reminds a march but with a \"vivace\" tempo.\n\nThe name of this variant probably comes from the musical genre \"maxixe\" that was once in vogue in Cape Verde. It is a variant that looks like the previous one, but with an \"allegro\" tempo.\n\nIn spite of the name, this variant has no relationship with the present Brazilian genre samba. It seems to be an adaptation of the \"lundum\" to the accordion techniques. The tempo is slower (\"andante\") and the rhythm is different from the other variants, it is quite similar to the \"toada\".\n\nPractically, it is not known by this name, it is more known as slow \"funaná\". It seems to be an adaptation of the \"morna\" to the accordion techniques, with an andante tempo. While during a long time it was the \"morna\" (\"badju di viulinu\") that enjoyed some prestige in urban contexts and noble dance rooms, in rural contexts a slower version of \"funaná\" (\"badju di gaita\") was developed in contraposition. Curiously, this variant has the same tempo as the Boa Vista \"morna\" and not the Brava \"morna\".\n\n\nRIU Hotels opened one of its first resort and villas in the west of Santa Maria in the southwest end of the island of Sal named Riu Funaná after the music genre.\n\nEvery year, a best funaná is awarded at the Cabo Verde Music Awards since its first edition in 2011.\n\n\n"}

Performers disguise the fact that it is a performance from those who observe and who may choose to participate in it, thus leading spectators to view it as a real, unstaged event. \n\nThe Brazilian theater practitioner Augusto Boal and Panagiotis Assimakopoulos developed the form during their time in Argentina in the 1960s as part of his Theatre of the Oppressed, which focused on oppression and social issues. Invisible theatre developed in the context of increasingly repressive dictatorship in Brazil and Argentina. The purpose of invisible theatre was to show oppression in everyday life, in an everyday setting, without the audience or Spect-actors knowing. Boal went on to develop forum theater.\n\nInvisible theatre was developed in Buenos Aires as public and participatory action that avoided police authority. The Brazilian Augusto Boal was in exile in Argentina from 1971 to 1976 and wrote his first invisible theatre in collaboration with a group of actors. The invisible theatre was set at a busy restaurant at lunchtime, with actors sitting at different tables. One actor ordered à la card, but at the end of the lunch told the waiter that he could not pay the 70 soles. He offered to pay with his labour and asked the waiter how much he would get paid taking out the rubbish. Another actor, seated at another table, informed the customers that a rubbish collector gets paid 7 sole per hour. Yet another actor, on yet another table, told everyone that a gardener gets 10 soles per hour. Eventually another member of the actor crew started to collect money from the restaurant customers to pay the bill. \n\nBoal took theatre to an audience who did not recognise that they were the audience and Boal argued it was critical that actors participating in the invisible theatre did not reveal that they were actors. In its early phase invisible theatre aimed to raise public awareness of class differences and to provide a forum for articulating dissent.\n\nIn the late 1970s and the early 1980s Boal staged invisible theatre in Sicily, Stockholm, Paris and other European cities on issues such as racism, ageism, sexism and homelessness. He staged invisible theatre in public locations such as the Paris Metro and on Stockholm ferries.\n\nWhen Boal returned to Brazil in 1986, he produced a weekly invisible theatre for a Rio TV station. In one episode a dark-skinned man sold himself as a slave in the market, informing the crowd that he earned less than a 19th-century slave.\n\nHistorically invisible theatre developed after happenings were staged in Argentina by Oscar Mosatta. Mosatta had staged happenings in the late 1960s after he had attended such performances in New York in 1966. While happenings are also used to raise awareness about an issue, take place outside a theatre or gallery, and are scripted, the audience is aware that they are attending a happening. Boal states in \"Tecnicas latinoamericanas de teatro popular\" that invisible theater and happenings are distinct: \"El teatro invisible no debe ser confundido con el happening, que es un hecho teatral insólito, caótico, en que todo puede ocurrir, anárquicamente. [Invisible theater must not be confused with the happening, which is an unusual theatrical event, chaotic, in which anything can occur, anarchically.]\" \n\n\n"}

Pétursson\n\nJóhann Kristinn Pétursson (9 February 1913 – 26 November 1984), also known as The Icelandic Giant or The Viking Giant, was an Icelandic man who at his peak measured in height and weighed .\n\nBorn in Dalvík, Iceland on 9 February 1913 as the third of nine children in his family, Jóhann had a normal development until the age of 15, after which he experienced accelerated growth.\n\nAt the age of 17 he was very strong and reportedly could lift a lorry. but by age 20 had back and joint issues and had difficulty walking. In 1935, he was studied by Knud Krabbe in Copenhagen, who recorded his height at and his weight at but doubted that he had acromegaly as his body was proportional and there was no sign of hypogonadism. However, he had an enlarged sella turcica. He was re-examined in Leipzig in 1939, measuring at .\n\nDue to his physical ailments, Jóhann was unable to find normal employment and instead toured Europe's vaudeville theatres, doing so until the outbreak of World War II. He was in Copenhagen during the German invasion of Denmark and remained there until the end of the war, working in a shipyard. In 1948, he was invited to move to the United States by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. The tallest Icelandic man on record, his home, living trailer, vehicles, furniture, and clothing were all custom-made.\n\nDuring his career, he used the stage name \"der Nordische Riese Olaf\" (\"the Nordic Giant Olaf\") in Germany, and \"the Icelandic Giant\" or \"the Viking Giant\" in the U.S. In addition to being a circus performer, he acted in several movies, such as \"Prehistoric Women\". Early on in his career, he often wore a suit and top hat, but with the Ringling brothers he dressed as a stereotypical Viking, sporting a full beard and horned helmet. Billed at , he initially made US$200 (US$2,050 in 2017) per week when he came to the United States in 1948, but soon gained popularity and became an independent attraction, earning over US$1,000 (US$9,000 in 2017) per week by the mid-1950s.\n\nA prominent member of the Tampa Showmen's Association (TSA) and the International Independent Showmen's Association (IISA), he was involved in their charitable activities. His memory is honoured with personal belongings displayed in the Showmen's Museum of the IISA in Gibsonton, Florida.\n\nHe retired in 1963 and moved to Florida. He married and had one child, of average height. He spoke four languages: Icelandic, Danish, German and English. After sustaining a fall in Tampa, Florida in 1984, he returned to his birthplace Dalvík, where he died a few months later at the age of 71. He is buried in Dalvík.\n\n"}

The humanoid alien protagonist of the film, Klaatu (Michael Rennie), instructs Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) that if any harm befalls him, she must say the phrase to the robot Gort (Lockard Martin). In response Gort relents from destroying the Earth and resurrects Klaatu from death.\n\nThe Robot Hall of Fame describes the phrase as \"one of the most famous commands in science fiction\" and Frederick S. Clarke of \"Cinefantastique\" called it \"the most famous phrase ever spoken by an extraterrestrial.\"\n\nEdmund H. North, who wrote \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", also created the alien language used in the film, including the phrase \"Klaatu barada nikto\". The official spelling of the phrase comes directly from the script (as shown in the above image) and provides insight as to its proper pronunciation.\n\nThe phrase was never translated in the film and neither Edmund North nor did 20th Century Fox ever release an official translation.\n\nNear the end of the film, as Klaatu is pursued by the American military, he urges Helen Benson to memorize the phrase, saying \"There's no limit to what he can do. He could destroy the Earth... If anything should happen to me you must go to Gort, you must say these words: \"Klaatu barada nikto\".' Please repeat that.\"\n\nShortly after, Klaatu is shot and killed. Knowing that Klaatu has died, Gort vaporizes the polymer cube encasing him and disables the two soldiers standing guard. Helen conveys Klaatu's message. Gort takes her inside the spaceship, and then retrieves Klaatu's lifeless body, which he revives.\n\nIn the 2008 remake, the line was added at Keanu Reeves' insistence. Klaatu uses it near the beginning of the film to shut down Gort, and again at the end, highly distorted and barely audible, when he stops the destruction of the Earth. Although the line can be heard in the film, it does not appear in the English subtitles.\n\nBecause there is no official translation of the phrase, a few notable attempts have been made to determine the phrase's meaning:\n\nPhilosophy professor Aeon J. Skoble speculates the phrase is part of a fail-safe feature used during diplomatic missions, whereby Gort's deadly force can be deactivated in the event the robot is undesirably triggered into a defensive posture. Skoble observes that this theme has evolved into a \"staple of science fiction that the machines charged with protecting us from ourselves will misuse or abuse their power.\" In this interpretation the phrase apparently tells Gort that Klaatu considers escalation unnecessary.\n\n\"Fantastic Films\" explored the meaning of \"Klaatu barada nikto\" in the 1978 article \"The Language of Klaatu\". In the article Tauna Le Marbe, the magazine's Alien Linguistics Editor, attempts to translate all the alien words Klaatu used throughout the film. Le Marbe's literal translation was \"Stop Barbarism, (I have) death, bind;\" the free translation was \"I die, repair me, do not retaliate.\"\n\nThe documentary \"Decoding \"Klaatu Barada Nikto\": Science Fiction as Metaphor\" examined the phrase \"Klaatu barada nikto\" with some of the people involved with \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\". Robert Wise, director of the original, recalled a conversation he had with Edmund North, saying North told him, \"...it's just something I kind of cooked up. I thought it sounded good.\"\n\nBilly Gray, who played Bobby Benson in the film, said that \"barada nikto must mean... save Earth\". Florence Blaustein, widow of the producer Julian Blaustein, said North had to pass a street called Baroda every day going to work and said, \"I think that's how that was born.\" Film historian Steven Jay Rubin recalled an interview he had with North when he asked the question, \"What is the direct translation of 'Klaatu barada nikto?' And Edmund North said to me, 'There's hope for Earth, if the scientists can be reached.'\"\n\nIn accepting the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998, Director Robert Wise closed his remarks by saying, \"...I'd like to say 'Klaatu barada nikto', which, roughly translated tonight, means 'Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.'\"\n\n"}

An industry blueprint called Media 21 was also drawn up and eventually endorsed by the 2002 Economic Review Committee (chaired by then Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong) – as part of the Creative Industries Development Strategy to propel the growth of Singapore’s creative economy.\n\nOn 18 January 2016, Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) announced that the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) and MDA will be restructured into two new entities: The Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Government Technology Organisation (GTO), in the second half of 2016.\n\nPrior to the merger, SBA, which was formed on October 1994 under the purview of the previous Ministry of Information and the Arts (MITA), was set up to regulate the broadcasting industry in Singapore.\n\nFPD was set up as a department under the then MITA to regulate the content of films and publications on 1 January 1998. The Board of Film Censors was a part of the FPD, responsible for classification of films and videos.\n\nFollowing the footsteps of film promotion in other countries, SFC was established on 1998. Following the release of the recommendations under Media 21, SFC was merged under the MDA in 2003.\n\nThe Media Development Authority is responsible for promoting and regulating the Singapore media sector. MDA’s function is to grow the media industry by stimulating job creation, seeding and attracting investments, while setting standards that lay the foundation for building a cohesive and inclusive society.\n\nOne of MDA’s key initiatives is to develop industry roadmaps that position Singapore as the nucleus where media content, services and applications are financed, made and traded for the world. Media 21 was the first roadmap established by MDA in 2003 in response to global media convergence. More recently, the Singapore Media Fusion Plan (SMFP), a national media development blueprint, was launched in 2009 to s create the best environment in Singapore for media businesses to exploit new opportunities in digital media and move up the value chain, while enhancing the global appeal of Singapore media through international partnerships.\n\nIn 2011, MDA also revised its funding schemes. In 2013, it has five main schemes namely Production Assistance, Development Assistance, Marketing Assistance, Talent Assistance and Enterprise Assistance to help support different stages of a project. These schemes are applicable to projects across various sectors such as Film, Animation, Interactive media, Games, Publishing, Broadcast and Music.\n\nAnother key responsibility of MDA is to create and enforce regulatory policies that make Singapore an attractive place to encourage investment and innovation in the media sector, leading to more choices for consumers.\n\nSince the 1990s (under the purview of SBA) until now, it see itself leading the charge to address the latest challenges and opportunities faced by the media industry posed by media convergence and a digital media era through convergence regulation. For example, it was the first to articulate Internet policies and establish Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) standards in Southeast Asia.\n\nIts regulatory approach gradually shifted towards industry co-regulation and consultation to stimulate industry growth and yet serve the public interest for a maximum number of households in Singapore. Their focus appears to be to design policy frameworks that facilitate industry growth, whilst enabling informed choices and protecting the young from undesirable content.\n\nA key challenge for the regulator is how to ensure its policies keep in-step with community values to bring about community-led content standards, whilst providing an excellent level of customer responsiveness to customers. Recent examples include the introduction of new ratings under their content classification standards (e.g. PG13), and previously SBA’s Class Licence Scheme.\n\nLike regulators in developed countries like Australia and the UK, MDA works with other public agencies and various community groups to raise media literacy standards through public education initiatives to nurture a media savvy and connected society. MDA has initiated programmes that help to cultivate critical media awareness skills and cyber wellness values.\n\nRestrictions on freedom of speech and assembly are enforced by MDA.\n\nIn 2005, the MDA withheld the licence for Benny Lim's play \"Human Lefts\" unless some scenes were edited and all references to the death penalty removed. The play was originally written about the hanging of Shanmugam Murugesu and was to have been staged one day after the controversial execution of Australian national Nguyen Tuong Van. In August 2006, a play \"Smegma\" was banned by the MDA which said that \"the play portrays Muslims in a negative light.\"\n\nIn May 2013, the MDA announced its new compulsory license scheme for news websites with significant reach that report Singapore news. These sites must put up a performance bond of S$50,000 and are expected to remove content that is in breach of MDA standards within 24 hours, once notified to do so. This move was heavily criticised by more than 20 activists and bloggers who pointed out that the scheme would impact citizens’ ability to “receive diverse news information”.\n\nIn May 2014, 45 major arts groups released a paper strongly objecting to MDA's proposed optional scheme to train arts practitioners as \"content assessors\" to ensure compliance with the authority's classification guidelines. Such practitioners whose groups' \"content assessors\" mis-classify performances would face a fine of up to $5,000, and may have their licences revoked. The arts groups rejected such \"co-regulation\" as promoting self-censorship.\n\nOn 10 September 2014, Tan Pin Pin's award-winning documentary \"To Singapore, With Love\" was banned in Singapore, with the MDA claiming that it undermined national security as \"the individuals in the film have given distorted and untruthful accounts of how they came to leave Singapore and remain outside Singapore,\" and that \"a number of these self-professed 'exiles' were members of, or had provided support to, the proscribed Communist Party of Malaya (CPM).\" In response, a group of 39 artists, including filmmakers Anthony Chen, Royston Tan and Kelvin Tong, released a joint statement expressing \"deep disappointment\" and urged the MDA to reverse the ban. On 2 October 2014, Tan submitted \"To Singapore, With Love\", unchanged, to the MDA's Film Appeals Committee to review the film's ban. In a statement, Tan wrote, \"As we approach our 50th birthday, I feel that we as a people should be able to view and weigh for ourselves, through legitimate public screenings in Singapore, differing views about our past, even views that the government disagrees with. I hope that Film Appeals Committee will see the film and review the classification in this light.\" On 12 November 2014, Tan's review was denied. In a statement, the chairman of the Film Appeals Committee (FAC) said, \"While of commendable artistic standard, the FAC found the film to be a one-sided account with minimal attempts to provide a balanced mix of views beyond those provided by the interviewees featured in the film\". Of the 12 FAC members present, nine voted to uphold the classification while the other three voted that the film be given a Restricted 21 (R21) rating instead.\n\nIn June 2016, the MDA objected to 31 photographs in Iranian photojournalist Newsha Tavakolian's \"I Know Why the Rebel Sings\" exhibition, as part of the Singapore International Festival of the Arts's pre-festival The O.P.E.N. programme, as they featured \"female kurdish members from a terrorist-linked organisation, who had committed acts of violence to further their cause, for example suicide bombing.\" 15 of these photographs made it to the final cut of the exhibition and were disallowed. Festival director Ong Keng Sen issued a statement condemning MDA's explanation and pointing out that the photographs were already published in the readily accessible \"Time\" magazine, both online and off. He also pointed out the photos depicted the kurdish soldiers fighting ISIS, a greater evil. \"And so we are living with a new terror where we don’t know, it is out of our control,\" he said at the exhibition's launch.\n\n"}
{"id": "49927126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49927126", "title": "Micro movie", "text": "Micro movie\n\nA micro movie is a type of microcinema which refers to a short/micro film of any genre.\n\nMicro movies originated in China in 2010. Karen Mok (Hong Kong based singer/actress) and Adam Duke starred in \"Cadillac,\" which is regarded as the first micro movie. Afterwards, micro movies became a trend in South Asia. As professional-grade technology has become more accessible, amateurs hoping to enter the film industry have turned to the micro movie format to avoid limitations imposed by television and film studios. The accessibility of production, along with a growing popularity, has led to a wide range of subjects being featured and examined in the micro movie format.\n\n\nMovie censorship is the legal process that regulates whether a movie, film, video, or cinema has content that is permissible to undergo broadcast and distribution. While certain movies are permitted to undergo public disbursement and release, other types of movies are limited to private screenings—in certain cases, movies are prohibited and banned in their entirety. Movie censorship regulation takes length, content, and subject matter into consideration with regard to altering or banning the work. Obscene and violent content is avoided in the process of making micro movies due to national censorship policies.\n\nIn Hong Kong, all films are required to undergo the motion picture rating system, which is organized by the Office for Film Newspaper and Article Administration (OFNAA). Movies are rated I, IIA, IIB, or III. Scenes deemed to be unacceptable are censored. The Chinese State Administration of Press, Publication, Video, Film and Television oversees the theatrical release, to ensure that immoral content is not promoted in the movies. The goal of these measures is to protect the audience from receiving extreme and unhealthy messages.\n\nIn Australia, The Office of Film and Literature Classification is responsible for classifying films, video publications, and PC games according to the National Classification Code and the Classification Guidelines, which are approved by the Commonwealth State and Territory Ministers responsible for censorship.\n\nThere is, however, more leniency in censorship online—especially on YouTube. That is why most micro movies are accessed through social media websites and online databases. Some countries even block all internet access to YouTube.\n\nMicro movies are created by cinematographers of all skill levels, ranging from a first-time producer to a high-level producer with a top-level cast and crew.\n\nFilm techniques used in micro movies are similar to those of traditional movies seen in theaters. For instance, the types of shots and angles are the same, but they typically differ in film length, equipment level, budget, number of cast and crew, and acting skill. There are, however, exceptions to the rule such as the group Rocket Jump or prime-time TV commercials.\n\nMicro movies are used for advertising and entertainment purposes. The short length of micro movies allows them to be promoted and published on platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. This makes micro movies free, easy to access, and able to go viral online.\n\nThere are both commercial and noncommercial needs for micro movies. Commercials are now not only selling a product, but telling a story— the Budweiser and Extra Gum commercials are examples of this. Micro movies have become a new way to promote products and brands. People are also now creating and shooting micro movies for fun. There are several micro movie film festivals and platforms for both amateurs and professionals to tell their stories and be recognized for their work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42038766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42038766", "title": "Paintings conservator", "text": "Paintings conservator\n\nA paintings conservator is an individual responsible for protecting cultural heritage in the form of painted works of art. These individuals are most often under the employ of museums, conservation centers, or other cultural institutions. They oversee the physical care of collections, and are trained in chemistry and practical application of techniques for repairing and restoring paintings.\n\nA paintings conservator works with a number of museum professionals to ensure painted works of art receive the best quality of care. This individual may be called upon by a Registrar/Collections Manager (RCM) in the event of an emergency, such as accidental damage. A paintings conservator may also be called upon to consult with the RCM and an exhibition design team to ensure a work is stable enough for display, and determine how much exposure to environmental factors, such as humidity or light, it can withstand.\n\nPreventive care is the abating of potential deterioration and damage to a painting through previously designated policies and procedures surrounding the object's storage and handling.\n\nEmergency preparedness and an emergency plan are crucial pieces to have in place for a museum. It informs conservators, RCMs, and all other museum personnel how to respond to disasters that may strike their institution, and therefore its collections. These plans can be expansive, detailing a number of procedures for different contingencies, such as fire, flooding, and even war. Protective measures in an emergency plan should include prevention through risk management, preparedness and response training, and recovery arrangements. An institution should know which staff member's are delegated to a project during a given circumstance, and be able to tell them how they will assess and move forward with the help of an emergency plan.\n\nIntegrated pest management (IPM) is the strategy used by a museum to handle pests such as mold, insects, or mice. An IPM program may address structural and environmental issues that contribute to the pest problem. This could include preventing initial entry of pests into the structure through building maintenance, moderating the interior climate, and setting up an insect monitoring system. Like an emergency plan, IPM can be time-consuming and require a number of responsibilities from each staff member. However, if pests do become an issue for a single painting or the entire museum, an IPM system will be helpful to have in place. Prevention is a key part of IPM, as chemical pesticides and fumigants can also be harmful to collections.\n\nInter-museum loans can put paintings at great risk, simply due to the fact that they are being moved. The amount of stress a painting can withstand is determined by a number of pre-existing factors, such as canvas and painting technique. Prior to the loan, a paintings conservator will assess the structure of the work for weaknesses and potential areas at risk. This helps determine if a piece is suitable for a loan and how it will be packed and transported. Preparation for a loaned painting generally involves padding the work's frame and ensuring it is properly mounted, determination as to whether it will need a backing board, and what repairs the frame may need prior to transport. The paintings conservator may also be called upon to collaborate with other personnel from the loaning museum to assess the environment of the institution that is borrowing the work. He or she may also take into consideration the travel route between the loaning and the borrowing institutions. The transit planner must consider environmental conditions on the route, how often the work will need to be handled, and security.\n\nExamination is a series of scientific processes by which a paintings conservator collects information regarding the materials used, the technique of the painter, and what has contributed to the painting's current state. Examination is a process that has evolved with the field of conservation. Taking samples of materials in a painting has decreased in favor of less invasive techniques for analysis. Examination has become a crucial part of the museum, conservation, and art historical worlds, helping to place paintings within a cultural and historical context.\n\nA painting's natural aging process, as well as environmental factors, can require intervention by a paintings conservator to restore the work. Reasons for restoration may include water damage, tearing, flaking, and a weakened canvas. The primary goal of a paintings conservator conducting a restoration is to ensure the work is stable. From there, they may integrate repairs that preserve the artist's original intent.\n\nUltraviolet light\n\nUltraviolet light examinations are used to reveal varnishes and their ages, as well as previous treatments to a painting. Varnishes fluoresce under UV light and dark spots reveal areas of retouching. Brightness of the painting's glow also helps to reveal the type of varnish used.\n\nRaking Light\nRaking light is an oblique-angled light that can record condition problems of a painting, showing the extent of the damage to a particular work. Raking light also aids in identifying the topography of brush strokes in paintings, sometimes revealing the underlying original intent of an artist.\n\nInfrared light\n\nThe use of infrared lighting can reveal the working methods of an artist, such as initial sketches and perspective lines drawn on a canvas. This method is effective on works that have a contrasting pale ground.\n\nX-radiography\n\nX-radiographs of a painting allow conservators to see beneath the work's surface. The use of this method also helps distinguish between materials that look similar under visible light, but have different x-ray absorption. For example, the Victoria and Albert Museum used x-radiography on a painting by Jean-Francois Millet entitled \"The Wood Sawyers.\" The image below showed a woman representing the French Republic, a submission to a competition that Millet would lose. Without the means to pay for a new canvas, Millet painted over the existing image.\n\nThe use of lasers allows for control and accuracy in the removal of aged or deteriorated layers on painted works, as well as identifying materials and layers within a painting. In 2012, Duke University scientists developed a laser for melanoma diagnoses. Through work with the National Gallery and the North Carolina Museum of Art, the scientists have determined that this laser can also be used to identify the chemical signatures of pigments and three-dimensional structures in layers of artwork. Another Duke University chemist also invented a useful laser for painting conservators that removes layers of old varnish.\n\nVarnishes are applied to paintings to enhance the appearance of the image, as well as to protect it over time. When dry, varnishes are typically transparent and can vary in gloss and durability as its composition changes. Varnishes may be organic or synthetic. Since natural varnishes tend to darken or discolor over time, attention from a paintings conservator is often necessary to remove, replace, or restore it. It is again important to remember the artist's original intent when choosing a new varnish. Varnishes often offer a desired effect, and a synthetic variety may not offer what an originally natural resin provided.\n\nA paintings conservator will likely have acquired a master's degree, or higher. There are several graduate programs throughout the United States, and the world, for arts conservation and restoration training. The education and training of a conservator will vary depending on the institution he or she is employed by, but paintings conservators will have knowledge of chemistry and the physical sciences as related to the deterioration and protection of cultural heritage in painted works. Practical application of training may be applied in the form of internships or fellowships, depending on the level of education an individual has received.\n\nConservation and the practice of restoration are controversial themselves, as they involve permanent changes made to an artist's work. This is why it is important for a paintings conservator to examine a work closely before making restorative changes. In doing so, they can often identify original varnishes and layers that contributed to the artist's intent for the appearance of the work. However, even close examination and careful restoration does not protect a paintings conservator or a work from being the center of controversy.\n\nRestoration of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican has been ongoing during the latter part of the twentieth century. Much of the criticism and controversy surrounding the restoration is that previous attempts to restore the frescoes have done more damage than good. Critics of modern restoration have suggested a more conservative approach to prevent further deterioration, rather than contribute to its problems through restorative measures.\n\nRestoration on Leonardo da Vinci's \"Last Supper\" finished in 1999 after two decades of work. Many believe the work done was clumsy, with some features being unrecognizably bright while others went missing altogether.\n\nIn 2012, Cecilia Giménez, an elderly woman without conservation training, attempted to restore an \"Ecce Homo\" fresco in a Spanish church. The fresco had been flaking due to moisture on the walls, and this reportedly upset the woman. Her resulting restorative work left the portrait with what many have described as looking monkeyish, with cartoonish eyes and a smudged mouth. The restoration attempt came to light after a family member of the original artist proposed a fund for conservation work.\n\n"}

Since prostitution is a sensitive indicator that develops with changes in the social environment and the state, it is useful to divide the history of this phenomenon from Estonia's first independence according to the different historical stages of the country.\n\nFirstly, the period of Estonian independence 1918-1940, when the prostitution in Estonia was legalized. Secondly, the period of the Soviet occupation when prostitution was criminalized. Thirdly, since Estonian new independence when prostitution is neither criminalized nor legalized (that is, the selling of and buying of a sexual service is not a crime but prostitution is not considered a profession either).\n\nOn the first of June 1919, so-called morality guarding, or censoring institution in the bigger cities replaced censoring police. Attitudes to the organization of prostitution derived mainly from health considerations. That was not sufficiently successful and in May 1920, obligatory measures to fight prostitution and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) were issued. Those regulations linked the activities of the “morality guards” to the activities of police, as it was realized that prostitution and criminality were“closely connected’.\nOn the 16 of December 1927 the Parliament accepted a new law of “Managing Public Health” which handed the fight against prostitution over to the Health and Social Support Department. The police were obliged to give necessary practical help.\n\nBecause prostitution was legal in 1918-1940, the data from that period is remarkably precise and allows giving an adequate overview of the phenomenon. The number of prostitutes had been relatively stable throughout that period, showing only a slight increase.\nFor instance, in 1919 and 1920, there were 1187 and 1141 registered prostitutes in Estonian cities, and the number remained the same until the 1930s.\nProstitution mainly spread in the greater cities, Tallinn and Tartu, but also in Narva and Pärnu. The proportion in other cities was very modest. There were 387 permanent prostitutes registered in Tallinn in 1920, and 455 in 1940. In Tartu, the numbers were 53 in 1922 and 156 in 1938.\nThere were also illegal, unregistered individual prostitutes of whom there is very little and non-systematic data. In the mid-1920s the number of Estonian hidden prostitutes was estimated to be up to 2000-2500. Police measures were predominantly directed to uncovering and registering this contingent, because unlike the registered prostitutes, neither unofficial prostitute nor their clients went through regular medical check-ups.\n\nProstituting took place mainly in “pleasure flats” where the woman was operating as a “free tenant”. Each of these apartments had approximately 4-9 women. In 1940, there were 47 of such apartments registered. The majority (90%) of Tallinn prostitutes in the beginning of the 1920s were Estonians, 8% were Russians and the rest other nationalities. Thirty per cent were up to 20 years old, but the largest group was 20–25 years old (about 50%) and 26–30 years old were represented at around 15%. About 30% were born in Tallinn, 60% from elsewhere in Estonia and about 10% from abroad.\n\nAlong with Estonia's occupation by the Soviet Union, attitudes to prostitution changed drastically. Legalization of prostitution was replaced by total denial and was made criminal. For instance, Tallinn City Moral Censoring Unit and Ambulatory of STDs which had been controlling the prostitutes and their health, was now liquidated on the 16 of November 1940, only a few months after occupation. Prostitutes who were registered at the police were repressed as “socially alien beings” and were listed, along with thousands of other people, to be deported from Estonia in 1941.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, pornography, prostitution and organizing prostitution were criminalized and belonged to the phenomena called parasitic lifestyle. There were three relevant paragraphs in the Criminal Law: Criminal Code of Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ESSR) (paragraph 200) - preparing or distributing a pornographic item; paragraph 201 - keeping a brothel; paragraph 201-3 - begging, vagrant or the parasitic lifestyle.\n\nPimping was not considered in the Criminal Law of ESSR. In reality those paragraphs that were related to prostitution were hardly ever used. The reason was absence of prostitution as a mass phenomenon in Soviet Estonia and indifference to it from that part of the government. In Tallinn, only a type of systematically operating prostitutes existed - the so-called “foreign currency prostitutes” who were only serving foreigners. Since the KGB kept a vigilant eye on foreigners, the activities of those prostitutes were only feasible with the knowledge and control of this structure. There are some reasons to suggest that some prostitutes serving foreigners were used as informants by the KGB.\n\nCertain changes started in the mid-1980s when the first signs of private businesses emerged. That also brought along differentiation of incomes. The increase in the relations with foreigners had a great impact on the following processes. Due to the rise in prostitution, a new administrative liability for the activity was introduced in 1987. In 1998, the police registered over 268 females who had been caught performing sexual services for money in hostels and hotels.\n\nProstitution is currently legal in Estonia, but pimping is prohibited. Forced prostitution and other abusive activities which surround the sex trade are also outlawed. UNAIDS estimate there are 1,000 prostitutes in the country.\n\nAn inquiry by police officers in the capital Tallinn estimated that 27% of the 1,000 sex workers in the city were under 18, and a research study by ECPAT has estimated a similar proportion within the country.\n\nEstonia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and girls subjected to sex trafficking. Estonian women and children are subjected to sex trafficking within Estonia and in other European countries. Women are increasingly exposed to trafficking as a result of sham marriages outside of Estonia; the women enter the marriages willingly, but their passports are confiscated and they are forced into prostitution. Stateless residents in Estonia were especially vulnerable to trafficking. Vietnamese nationals subjected sexual exploitation transit Estonia en route to other EU countries.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Estonia as a 'Tier 1' country.\n\n"}

{"id": "6316662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6316662", "title": "Rupert D'Oyly Carte", "text": "Rupert D'Oyly Carte\n\nRupert D'Oyly Carte (3 November 1876 – 12 September 1948) was an English hotelier, theatre owner and impresario, best known as proprietor of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and Savoy Hotel from 1913 to 1948.\n\nSon of the impresario and hotelier Richard D'Oyly Carte, Rupert inherited the family businesses from his stepmother Helen. After serving in World War I, he took steps to revitalise the opera company, which had not appeared in Central London since 1909, hiring new designers and conductors to present fresh productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas in seasons in the West End. The new productions generally retained the original text and music of the operas. Carte launched international and provincial tours, as well as the London seasons, and he released the first complete recordings of the operas. He also rebuilt the half-century-old Savoy Theatre in 1929, opening the house with a season of Gilbert and Sullivan.\n\nAs an hotelier, Carte built on his father's legacy, expanding the Savoy Hotel, refreshing the other hotels and restaurants in the Savoy group, including Claridge's and the Berkeley Hotel, and introducing cabaret and dance bands that became internationally famous. He also increased marketing activities, including foreign marketing, of the hotels.\n\nP. G. Wodehouse based a character in his novels, Psmith, on a Wykehamist schoolboy whom he identified as Rupert D'Oyly Carte. At his death, Carte passed the opera company and hotels to his only surviving child, Bridget D'Oyly Carte. The Gilbert and Sullivan operas, nurtured by Carte and his family for over a century, continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond.\n\nRupert D'Oyly Carte was born in Hampstead, London, the younger son of the impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte and his first wife Blanche (née Prowse), who died in 1885. Like his brother, Lucas (1872–1907), he was given his father's middle name. He was educated at Winchester College, noted as among the most intellectually rigorous of English public schools. He then worked for a firm of accountants before joining his father as an assistant in 1894.\n\nIn a newspaper interview given in the year of his death, Rupert recalled that as a young man he was entrusted, during his father's illness, with helping W. S. Gilbert with the first revival of \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" at the Savoy Theatre. He was elected a director of the Savoy Hotel Limited in 1898, joining his father and Sir Arthur Sullivan, who had served on the board since the Savoy Hotel was built. By 1899 he was assistant managing director. Richard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901, and Rupert's stepmother, the former Helen Lenoir, who had married Richard in 1888, assumed full control of most of the family businesses, which she had increasingly controlled during her husband's decline. Rupert's elder brother, Lucas, a barrister, was not involved in the family businesses and died of tuberculosis, aged 34.\n\nIn 1903, at the age of 27, Rupert took over his late father's role as chairman of the Savoy group, which included the Savoy Hotel, Claridge's, The Berkeley Hotel, Simpson's-in-the-Strand and the Grand Hotel in Rome. At this time, the whole group was officially valued at £2,221,708. He immediately issued £300,000 of debentures to raise capital for a large extension to the Savoy (the \"East Block\"). Like his father, Carte was willing to go to great lengths to secure the best employees for his hotels. When Claridge's needed a new chef in 1904, he secured the services of François Bonnaure, formerly chef at the Élysée Palace in Paris. The press speculated on how much Carte must have paid to persuade Bonnaure to join him, and compared the younger Carte's audacity with his father's coup in securing Paris's most famous \"maître d'hôtel\", M. Joseph, a few years earlier.\nBetween 1906 and 1909, Helen Carte, Rupert's stepmother, staged two repertory seasons at the Savoy Theatre. Directed by Gilbert and received with much success, they revitalised the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which had been in decline after Richard D'Oyly Carte's death. In 1912, when theatre censorship was under discussion in Britain, Carte was strongly in favour of retaining censorship, because it gave managements complete certainty about what they could or could not stage without fear of interference by the police or others. He joined with other London theatre managers, including Herbert Beerbohm Tree, George Edwardes and Arthur Bourchier in signing a petition for the retention of censorship. In the same year, together with Herbert Sullivan and theatre managers including Beerbohm Tree and Squire Bancroft, Carte was an instigator of a memorial to W. S. Gilbert at Charing Cross. In 1913, Rupert's stepmother Helen Carte died. She left all her holdings in the Savoy Hotel group, the Savoy Theatre and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to her stepson.\n\nAfter London seasons in 1906–07 and 1908–09, the opera company did not perform in the West End again until 1919, although it continued to tour in Great Britain. According to the theatre writer H. M. Walbrook, \"Through the years of the Great War they continued to be on tour through the country, drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere. They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period, and by so doing they helped to win the victory.\" Nevertheless, Carte later recalled, \"I went and watched the Company playing at a rather dreary theatre down in the suburbs of London. I thought the dresses looked dowdy... I formed the view that new productions should be prepared, with scenery and dresses to the design of first class artists who understood the operas but who would produce a décor attractive to the new generation.\" In a 1922 memoir, Henry Lytton, having admired Richard D'Oyly Carte's keen eye for stagecraft, added, \"That 'eye' for stagecraft ... has been inherited in a quite remarkable degree by his son, Mr. Rupert D'Oyly Carte. He, too, has the gift of taking in the details of a scene at a glance, and knowing instinctively just what must be corrected\". In 1911, the company hired J. M. Gordon as stage manager, and Carte later promoted him to director. Gordon, under Carte's supervision, preserved the company's traditions in exacting detail for 28 years.\nDuring World War I Carte served in the Royal Navy, and no renovation work could be undertaken. On his return, he put his aims into effect. In an interview in \"The Observer\" in August 1919 he set out his policy for staging the operas: \"They will be played precisely in their original form, without any alteration to the words, or any attempt to bring them up to date.\" This uncompromising declaration was modified in a later interview in which he said, \"the plays are all being restaged ... Gilbert's words will be unaltered, though there will be some freshness in the method of rendering them. Artists must have scope for their individuality, and new singers cannot be tied down to imitate slavishly those who made successes in the old days.\"\n\nCarte's first London season, at the Prince's Theatre, 1919–20, featured ten of the thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas. These included \"Princess Ida\", which had its first London performances since the original production. The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction. As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the J. C. Williamson company and to amateur companies, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings. In an interview with \"The Times\" in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy \"tradition\" was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: \"It did not by any means imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression. All that it implied, in his view, was the highest possible standard of production – with especial attention to clear enunciation... Many people seemed to think that Gilbert believed in absolutely set methods but this was not by any means the case. He did not hesitate to alter productions when they were revived.\"\n\nAlthough he had told the press that the original words and music would not be altered, Carte was willing to make changes in certain cases. In 1919–20, he authorised significant cuts and alterations in both \"Princess Ida\" and \"Ruddigore\". In 1921 \"Cox and Box\" was produced in a drastically cut-down version, to allow it to be played as a companion piece with the shorter Savoy operas. He also authorised changes to Gilbert's text: he wrote to \"The Times\" in 1948, \"We found recently in America that much objection was taken by coloured persons to a word used twice in \"The Mikado\".\" The word in question was Gilbert's reference to \"nigger\" (blackface) minstrels, and Carte asked A. P. Herbert to suggest an acceptable revision. \"He made several alternative suggestions, one of which we adopted in America, and it seems well to go on doing so in the British Empire.\"\nCarte commissioned new costumes and scenery throughout his tenure with the company. For his restagings, Carte hired Charles Ricketts to redesign \"The Gondoliers\" and \"The Mikado\", the costumes for the latter, created in 1926, being retained by all the company's subsequent designers. Other redesigns were by Percy Anderson, George Sheringham, Hugo Rumbold and Peter Goffin, a protégé of Carte's daughter, Bridget D'Oyly Carte.\n\nFor London seasons, Carte often engaged guest conductors, first Geoffrey Toye, then Malcolm Sargent, who examined Sullivan's manuscript scores and purged the orchestral parts of accretions. So striking was the orchestral sound produced by Sargent that the press thought he had retouched the scores, and Carte had the pleasant duty of correcting their error. In a letter to \"The Times\", he noted that \"the details of the orchestration sounded so fresh that some of the critics thought them actually new ... the opera was played last night exactly as written by Sullivan.\" Carte also hired Harry Norris, who started with the touring company, then was Toye's assistant before becoming musical director. Isidore Godfrey joined the company as assistant musical director in 1925 and became musical director in 1929, remaining in that post until 1968.\nThe possibilities of the gramophone appealed to Carte. After World War I, he supervised a series of complete recordings of the scores of the operas on the HMV label, beginning with \"The Mikado\" in 1918. The first nine sets, made between 1918 and 1925, were recorded by the early acoustic process. At first, guest singers were chosen who were known for their ability to record well on this technology. Later in this series, more of the regular members of the company were featured. With the introduction of electrical recording and its greatly improved recording process and sound, a new round of recordings began in 1927. For the electrical series, Carte's own singers were mostly used. Carte also recognised the potential of radio and worked with the BBC to relay live broadcasts of D'Oyly Carte productions. A 1926 relay of part of a Savoy Theatre performance of \"The Mikado\" was heard by up to eight million people. The \"London Evening Standard\" noted that this was \"probably the largest audience that has ever heard anything at one time in the history of the world.\" Under Carte, the company continued to make broadcasts during the interwar years. In 1932, \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" became the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be broadcast in its entirety.\n\nIn 1929 Carte had the 48-year-old Savoy Theatre rebuilt and modernised. It closed on 3 June 1929 and was gutted and completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with décor by Basil Ionides. The old house had three tiers; the new one had two. The seating capacity (which had decreased to 986 from its original 1,292) was restored nearly completely, to 1,200. The theatre reopened 135 days later on 21 October 1929, with \"The Gondoliers,\" designed by Ricketts and conducted by Sargent. The critic Ernest Newman wrote, \"I can imagine no gayer or more exhilarating frame for the Gilbert and Sullivan operas than the Savoy as it is now.\"\n\nDespite its historical connection with Gilbert and Sullivan, most of Carte's London seasons were staged not at the Savoy but at two larger houses: the Prince's (now the Shaftesbury) Theatre (1919–20, 1921–22, 1924, 1926, 1942 and Sadler's Wells (1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1947 and 1948). His three Savoy Theatre seasons were in 1929–30, 1932–33, and 1941. In addition to year-round UK tours, Carte mounted tours of North America in 1927, 1928–29, 1934–35, 1936–37, 1939 and 1947–48). During the 1936 tour an American critic wrote, \"If there were only some way of keeping them on this side permanently. I humbly suggest to the New Deal that it cancel England's war debt in exchange for the D'Oyly Cartians. We should be much the gainer.\"\n\nCarte was deeply affected by the death of his son Michael in 1932, discussed below. The actor Martyn Green said, \"The heart dropped right out of him. His interest in both the operas and the hotel seemed to fade away.\" Nevertheless, in 1934 the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with Green as its new principal comedian, replacing Henry Lytton. Carte gave approval for, and was closely consulted about, a 1938 film version of \"The Mikado\" produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye, starring Green and released by Universal Pictures, but his only new stage production after 1932 was of \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" designed in 1939 by Peter Goffin. The re-staging was regarded as radical, but when Goffin took fright at the storm of controversy, Carte told him, \"I don't care what they say about the production. I should care if they said nothing.\"\n\nOn 3 September 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, the British government ordered the immediate and indefinite closure of all theatres. Carte cancelled the autumn tour and disbanded the company. Theatres were permitted to reopen from 9 September, but it took some weeks to re-form the company. The company resumed touring in Edinburgh on Christmas Day 1939. It continued to perform throughout the war, but German bombing destroyed the sets and costumes for five of its productions: \"Cox and Box\", \"The Sorcerer\", \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", \"Princess Ida\" and \"Ruddigore\". The old productions of \"Pinafore\" and \"Cox and Box\" were recreated shortly after the war, but the other two operas took longer to rejoin the company's repertory. On the other hand, for the first wartime season, Peter Goffin designed and directed a new production of \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" first seen in January 1940, and his new \"Ruddigore\" debuted in 1948, shortly after Carte's death. A return of the Company to the U.S. in 1947 was very successful.\n\nFrom the beginning of his career, Carte maintained the Savoy group in London, disposing in 1919 of the Grand Hotel, Rome, which his father had acquired in 1896. In the 1920s, he ensured that the Savoy continued to attract a fashionable clientele by a continuous programme of modernisation and the introduction of dancing in the large restaurants. The Savoy Orpheans and the Savoy Havana Band were described by \"The Times\" as \"probably the best-known bands in Europe\". In 1927 Carte appointed his opera company's general manager, Richard Collet, to run the cabaret at the Savoy, which began in April 1929.\n\nUntil the 1930s, the Savoy group had not thought it necessary to advertise, but Carte and his manager George Reeves-Smith changed their approach. Reeves-Smith told \"The Times\", \"We are endeavouring by intensive propaganda work to get more customers; this work is going on in the U.S.A., in Canada, in the Argentine and in Europe.\" Towards the end of World War II, Carte added to the Savoy group the bombed-out site near Leicester Square of Stone's Chop House, the freehold of which he purchased with a view to reopening the restaurant there on the lines of the group's Simpson's-in-the-Strand. The revived Stone's reopened after Carte's death.\n\nIn 1907, Carte married Lady Dorothy Milner Gathorne-Hardy (1889–1977), the third and youngest daughter of the 2nd Earl of Cranbrook, with whom he had a daughter, Bridget, and a son, Michael (1911–1932). Michael was killed at the age of 21 in a motor accident in Switzerland. In 1925, Carte and his wife had a country house built for them in Kingswear, Devon named Coleton Fishacre. The house is still known for its design features and garden with exotic tropical plants. After her parents' divorce, Bridget D'Oyly Carte took over the house, which her father, who lived in London, would visit for long weekends. She sold the house after his death, and it is now owned by the National Trust.\nCarte's private pastimes included gardening, notably at Coleton Fishacre, driving and yachting. He was an early devotee of the motor car and incurred the displeasure of the courts more than once. He was fined £3 for driving at 19 miles an hour in 1902, and the following year he was subject to criminal prosecution for knocking down and injuring a child when driving at the speed of 24 miles an hour. He made \"every provision for the comfort of the child\", who recovered from the accident. In the years after World War I, he was a frequent competitor in yachting races. From 1919 he raced his yacht \"Kali\" in the Hamble River class. Later, he owned and raced a 19-ton cutter, \"Content\".\n\nIn 1941, Carte divorced his wife for adultery. The suit was undefended. Lady Dorothy moved to the Bahamas and married St Yves de Verteuil, who had been the co-respondent in the divorce case. De Verteuil died in 1963, and Lady Dorothy de Verteuil died in February 1977.\nP. G. Wodehouse based the character Psmith, seen in several of his comic novels, on either Rupert D'Oyly Carte or his brother Lucas. In the introduction to his novel \"Something Fresh\", Wodehouse says that Psmith (originally named Rupert, then Ronald) was \"based more or less faithfully on Rupert D'Oyly Carte, son of the Savoy theatre man. He was at school with a cousin of mine, and my cousin happened to tell me about his monocle, his immaculate clothes and his habit, when asked by a master how he was, of replying, 'Sir, I grow thinnah and thinnah'.\" Bridget D'Oyly Carte, however, believed that the Wykehamist schoolboy described to Wodehouse was not her father but his elder brother Lucas, who was also at Winchester College. Rupert D'Oyly Carte was \"shy, reserved and at times distinctly taciturn.\" Psmith, by contrast, is outgoing and garrulous.\n\nCarte died at the Savoy Hotel, after a brief illness, at the age of 71. A memorial service was held for him at the Savoy Chapel on 23 September 1948. His ashes were scattered on the headland at Coleton Fishacre. He left an estate valued at £228,436. At his death, the family businesses passed to his daughter, Bridget D'Oyly Carte. The Savoy hotel group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994. Carte's hotels have remained among the most prestigious in London, with the \"London Evening Standard\" calling the Savoy \"London's most famous hotel\" in 2009. The year after Carte's death, the opera company, which had been the personal possession of Richard and Rupert D'Oyly Carte, became a private company, of which Bridget retained a controlling interest and was chairman and managing director. She inherited a company in strong condition, but the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became unsustainable, and the company closed in 1982.\n\nThe Gilbert and Sullivan operas, nurtured by Carte and his family for over a century, continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond. By keeping the Savoy operas popular throughout the mid-20th century, Carte continued to influence the course of the development of modern musical theatre.\n\n\n"}

It operates a television channel, ATV, and a radio station, RNA; both of which broadcast in Catalan.\n\nPublic service broadcasting in the principality began on 26 October 1989 after the General Council of Andorra decided a national broadcasting organisation should be set up. As a result, the Organisme de Ràdio i Televisió d’Andorra (ORTA) was formed and radio station Ràdio Nacional d'Andorra (RNA) began broadcasting in December 1990. Andorra Televisió (ATV), Andorra's first television channel began in 1995. ORTA was funded by the Andorran government. All programming on both RNA and ATV was produced by independent companies until 1997 when ORTA began producing all of its own programming. ORTA was replaced by the current organisation, Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra S.A. (RTVA), on 13 April 2000. RTVA took full control of both RNA and ATV. RTVA is also funded by the government. Advertising provides additional revenue. Its current director-general is Francesc Robert. RTVA has been an active member of the European Broadcasting Union since 2002 and took part in the Eurovision Song Contest from 2004 to 2009 inclusive.; however, in 2012 it was believed to be due to withdraw from the EBU because of financial problems.\n\nThe broadcaster has to compete with TV and radio stations from both France and Spain whose transmissions can easily be picked up in the principality.\n\n\nATV broadcasts a range of programming including sports, music, films and magazine shows as well as the daily children's strand \" Club Piolet\". The flagship news programme \"ATV Noticies\" is produced and broadcast three times a day, with bulletins at 1345, 2100 and prior to closedown. Regular live parliamentary coverage is also broadcast. ATV usually broadcasts between the hours of 0730 and 2345 each day with information pages displayed after closedown.\n\nRNA broadcasts mostly music although news bulletins air on the hour, every hour. The station broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nATV and RNA are streamed online for free on RTVA's website, although the ATV stream is sometimes replaced with a test card due to copyright restrictions on some programming.\n\n"}

{"id": "798027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=798027", "title": "Skeletor", "text": "Skeletor\n\nSkeletor () is a fictional character and the main antagonist of the \"Masters of the Universe\" franchise created by Mattel. He is the archenemy of He-Man. Depicted as a muscular blue humanoid with a purple hood over his yellow bare-bone skull. Skeletor seeks to conquer Castle Grayskull so he can obtain its ancient secrets, which would make him unstoppable and enable him to conquer and rule the fictional world of Eternia. However, the incompetence of his henchmen is always an impediment to achieving his ambitions.\n\nIn the 2002 series, Skeletor was once a man named Keldor whose face was accidentally splashed with acid. He survived, but at the cost of his own face.\n\nThe first minicomics that accompanied the 1981–1983 line of Masters of the Universe toys presented the earliest version of continuity, and displayed many differences from the more widely known continuity of the later cartoon made by Filmation, and the later minicomics which complemented it. He-Man was depicted as the scarcely superhuman champion of a tribe of stone-age jungle-dwellers. There was no royal court of Eternia, King Randor, Queen Marlena, or Prince Adam yet.\n\nThese very first minicomics, which were actually more like storybooks, with a single image per page footed by prose, stated that Skeletor was originally an inhabitant of another dimension, populated with others of \"his kind.\" During \"The Great Wars,\" an ambiguous concept which is largely ignored in later continuities, a hole was opened in the dimensional wall and Skeletor was thrown from his world into Eternia. Significantly different from the lonelier and entirely self-serving Skeletor of later depictions, the villain's key motivation in this first story is to reopen the rift between his world and Eternia, thus allowing Skeletor's race to invade and conquer Eternia alongside him. \"This\" was the initially stated reason behind Skeletor's desire to obtain the powers of Castle Grayskull, not merely seeking power for its own sake as is generally the case in later depictions. However, as this first incarnation of the franchise's continuity was particularly short-lived, many questions about this version of Skeletor's origin are left unanswered.\n\nIn the 1980s cartoon series, Skeletor is a former pupil of Hordak, leader of the Evil Horde. When Hordak and his Horde invaded Eternia and stormed the palace, Hordak broke in and kidnapped one of the King and Queen's twin babies.\nMan-At-Arms and the Royal Guard captured Hordak's apprentice, Skeletor, and forced him to divulge the whereabouts of his master, who had retreated to his base of operations, Snake Mountain. When cornered, Hordak opened up a random dimensional portal (later revealed to have led to Etheria) and leaped through with the baby Princess Adora in his possession. Skeletor remained on Eternia, raised an army of powerful minions of his own and took over as ruler of Snake Mountain. Skeletor's main goal is to conquer the mysterious fortress of Castle Grayskull, from which He-Man draws his powers. If he succeeds, Skeletor would be able to conquer not only Eternia, but the whole universe. At the same time, his other goal is to take revenge on Hordak and overthrow Horde Prime in his bid to conquer the universe.\n\nSkeletor appeared in 71 of the 130 episodes of the 1980s \"He-Man\" cartoon (33 episodes in the first season, 38 in the second). While he was occasionally seen as a bumbling figure whose plans were always foiled by He-Man and his friends, his intentions to conquer Eternia were taken seriously by He-Man. He-Man regarded Skeletor as his arch-foe, and Skeletor's plans were sometimes ruined through the fault of his minions rather than by his own incompetence.\n\nIn the minicomics that followed the cancellation of the Filmation animated series, which can be seen as following on from the same continuity as the Filmation series, although there are still various contradictions, it is hinted that Skeletor is in fact Keldor, King Randor's long lost brother.\n\nThis implication occurs specifically in the 1986 minicomic entitled \"The Search for Keldor\", a story that involves Prince Adam and Randor searching for Randor's lost brother Keldor. When Skeletor learns of their quest, he muses that \"they must never discover the secret of Keldor\", as the truth will lead to his destruction.\n\nIn this story King Randor announces that Keldor disappeared years ago. \"He thought to master magic; when his experiments went wrong and he was lost in a dimension beyond time!\" One of the few elements of Skeletor's back story that remains consistent throughout the various continuities is that he had come to Eternia from another dimension.\n\nIt is likely that Randor's statement about Keldor disappearing to another dimension is an attempt to reconcile Skeletor being He-Man's uncle with his Extra-Eternian origins. To find out what happened to Keldor, Randor and the Sorceress attempt to peer through a space-time rift that opens once every year.\n\nRandor announces \"I think I see Keldor... Or is it...\" Before he can see anything else, Skeletor appears, determined to stop them from finding out any more. Although Skeletor is defeated, he is able to prevent Randor from discovering Keldor's fate as the rift once again closes for another year.\n\nSkeletor's frantic effort to cover up what happened to Keldor, combined with the fact that Keldor vanished to another dimension when attempting to become a master sorcerer, is taken as a heavy implication that the two characters are indeed one and the same. Unfortunately, because the original MOTU toyline came to an end before the story could be resolved, it was never fully disclosed if this was officially intended to be the case.\n\nSteven Grant, the writer-for-hire of the minicomic in question, stated in a he-man.org interview that \"As far as I remember, Keldor was Skeletor... But, I don't think that was ever going to be revealed... I seem to remember it as one of those things Mattel came up with out of the blue... Slur Keldor and you end up with Skeletor... His back-story wasn't really worked out. Some sort of evil cosmic energies altered him. I think they were going for a Darth Vader thing, but it was a tack-on... The main idea was that if they found out Skeletor was Keldor, they'd be able to find out what had changed him and might find some way to reverse it.\"\n\nIn the new continuity of the 2002 animated series, Skeletor's original name was definitely Keldor; his appearance as such is shown and his exploits partially depicted. However, it seems unlikely that he is related to Randor in this continuity, as he has Skeletor's blue skin and some other slightly nonhuman features while he was still Keldor. In a he-man.org interview with one of producers of the 2002 series, it is revealed that Keldor is the half-brother of Randor; they have different mothers.\n\nIn the Masters of the Universe Classics toy line, further character development was introduced. This line has offered more in depth origins to the Masters of the Universe characters and a collaboration of all origins in attempt to create a new coherent continuity. According to their revised back story, Keldor is Randor's half-brother. Keldor's mother was a member of the Gar race and he was ousted from the royal castle due to his Gar heritage. He roamed Eternia for knowledge, eventually learning the Dark Arts from Hordak. He then sought to unite Eternia by ruling it himself and battle his own half-brother with his army of fellow misfits. After losing the battle and desperate to survive, he turned to his mentor Hordak who merged Keldor with an entity known as the Demo-Man. Together they formed Skeletor. \nKeldor also appears in the DC comics but was cursed by his father and became Skeletor\n\nSkeletor was the primary villain in the 1987 live-action film portrayed by Frank Langella. As this was a motion picture, Skeletor was allowed to be far more menacing and less comical. To prepare for the role, Langella had asked his kids questions about the character and watched the series. During the course of the movie, Skeletor captures Castle Grayskull and imprisons the Sorceress. Later, he absorbs the power of the Great Eye and transforms into a golden-armored warrior god, but is ultimately defeated by He-Man. Langella's version of Skeletor is clad in more regal attire than is traditionally seen. Rather than dark purple, he wears all black, and his costume is less scant, covering his entire body with a robe and a flowing cape. Langella's performance is highly regarded by fans and critics as being a high point in the film. Langella himself has also mentioned several times that Skeletor has been one of his favorite roles during his entire career.\n\n\"The New Adventures\" series sees Skeletor with a new outfit, chest armour, cybernetic implants and a mauve cape. Skeletor fools the Galactic Guardians, Hydron and Flipshot, into thinking he is the force of good they need to save their home planet, Primus, when in fact they came looking for He-Man. Unable to decide who is good and who is evil, Skeletor and He-Man are both transported to the futuristic planet Primus, where Skeletor reveals his true evil nature to the Primans as the Mutants attack. Skeletor and the Mutant leader, Flogg, come to an agreement: Skeletor will help Flogg conquer Primus in return for Flogg's help in destroying He-Man. One of Flogg's terms is that he will remain in charge of the Mutants. Skeletor agrees, and is able to manipulate and control Flogg from behind the scenes, while making himself a force to be reckoned with among Primans and Mutants alike.\n\nIn the episode \"Sword and Staff\", Skeletor finds a powerful crystal on Moon Nordor and absorbs its power, making him more powerful and evil than ever before, and changing his appearance drastically, including a yellow face with red eyes, and different armour and helmet, based on the \"Disks of Doom Skeletor\" toy. Throughout the series, Skeletor concocts various schemes to destroy He-Man and conquer Primus.\n\nAlthough \"The New Adventures\" series follows the continuity of the Filmation cartoon, Skeletor is quite a different character. He possesses a sarcastic sense of humor and often jokes and laughs, taking his own failures much better than in the previous series. He has a genuine relationship with Crita, a female mutant with purple skin. He even dances with her in one episode. He also works well with Flogg, Slush Head and the other Mutants as part of their team as well as having a pet named Gur. Though often displaying a more relaxed attitude, when enraged he simply becomes a maniac and lashes out in anger at anyone around him. He is able to instill fear into Flogg, despite being perfectly willing to take his orders when it suits his own purposes. Overall, the Skeletor in this series is portrayed as a far more competent and threatening character, despite his often comedic lines.\n\nThe first toys for the \"New Adventures\" line, which was Marketed simply as \"He-Man\", gave a different explanation for how He-Man and Skeletor ended up in the future via a mini-comic packed in with various figures, as well as actually providing a reason for the cybernetics Skeletor employed in the first few episodes of the \"New Adventures\" TV series. In this mini-comic, Skeletor also learned that He-Man and Prince Adam were the same being, only for Adam to become He-Man permanently. The energy output caused by this final change from prince to warrior was partly the reason for Skeletor's new cybernetic look when the character was forced to take drastic measures to treat wounds that would have otherwise been fatal without treatment.\n\nIn this new version, it is shown that Skeletor was formerly a warlord named Keldor who had trained in the dark arts. Keldor was taught the ways of black magic by summoning Hordak, who was trapped in the dark dimension, Despondos. He gathered a small band of warriors to attack the Hall of Wisdom. They encountered resistance from Captain Randor and his officers; Keldor fought Randor personally, wielding two swords with astounding proficiency, but when Randor disarmed him, Keldor threw a vial of acid at him. Randor deflected it with his shield, and the acid splashed on Keldor's face.\n\nAs Kronis called for an retreat, and Evil-Lyn took Keldor to Hordak's sanctuary, where Keldor summoned Hordak to save his life. Keldor agreed to pay whatever price Hordak wished for his own life, and Hordak transformed him, stripping the damaged tissues from his skull and dubbing him \"Skeletor\"; Keldor's head had been completely stripped of soft tissues, leaving only a floating skull. When Keldor saw his new appearance, he laughed maniacally about it; the incident perhaps shattering whatever sanity he had left. Hordak can also apparently speak to Skeletor from Despondos through telepathy which also causes Skeletor great pain.\n\nTrapped in the Dark Hemisphere by the Mystic Wall, Skeletor designed a machine that would smash it, but it needed the Corodite Crystal as a power source. When Mer-Man retrieved it, Skeletor destroyed the Mystic Wall and returned to menacing Eternia.\n\nUnlike his previous portrayals, Skeletor is not concerned with Castle Grayskull right away, until a giant fish-monster that had swallowed the remnants of the Corodite Crystal - thus making him hunger for power - heads toward Grayskull. The Eternian warriors, led by Man-At-Arms and He-Man, stop the monster, forcing Skeletor to ponder what could be in that ancient pile of stones worth dying for. At the time, the Heroic Warriors seem ready and willing to let Grayskull fall, and would likely have done so, if not for the urgings of Man-At-Arms, who had been swallowed whole by the monster. Skeletor directly attacks it with his Council of Evil: himself, Count Marzo, Evilseed, the three evil Giants and Webstor. When King Hiss and the Snake Men are freed from the Void, Hiss imprisons Skeletor, having him devoured by a giant snake, but Skeletor escapes after the Masters defeat Hiss.\n\nDespite owing his life to Hordak, Skeletor destroys Hordak's sanctuary to prevent him from returning. Skeletor did not want to hold up his end of the bargain and free Hordak from Despondos because he wants Eternia for himself. At the end of the Second Season, King Hiss revives Serpos, the Serpent God, who had been transformed into Snake Mountain by the Elders; Skeletor and his minions were inside the mountain at that time. Though Serpos is defeated and restored to its Snake Mountain form. If season three of the series had been produced, it would have seen Skeletor and He-Man dealing with the Horde invasion and the powerful Hordak, who it was said Skeletor would eventually have defeated. This season would have also shown Skeletor's part in the kidnapping of He-Man's twin sister, She-Ra, and sending her to Hordak to be raised. \n\nIn the show, Skeletor is again portrayed as a bully towards his minions but with an even more malicious edge, using his powerful abilities to threaten his followers or to silence them. He also constantly blames his followers for their defeats at the hands of the Masters, and rules through a policy of fear, which makes him somewhat different compared to King Hiss. Many episodes end with him either punishing or torturing his minions for their failures. Also like previous versions, he is shown to possess almost no loyalty towards his followers as demonstrated in the last episodes of the first season, where he sends his own Evil Warriors into a trap to get captured just to lull the Masters into a false sense of security. He even goes as far as replacing them with his 'Council of Evil'. He is further shown to be power mad and unwilling to share the spoils of war; as demonstrated when he tells Count Marzo when questioned if they will gain anything from Castle Grayskull, that he will give them a reward if he feels like doing so.\n\nIn the beginning of the first season he demonstrates a deep rooted hatred towards King Randor for his part in destroying his face and making him what he is now; though he also attributes that to Evil-Lyn for saving him. This gradually shifts towards hatred against He-Man for standing in his way constantly. Furthermore, his maniacal laughter can perhaps indicate that he might have become insane by the loss of his face, something that is mentioned in the \"Icons of Evil\" comics when Kronis, who later becomes the villain Trap-Jaw, mentions that Skeletor is no longer the leader he once followed. Finally, despite his evil, Skeletor has been known to grovel when his life is in jeopardy, though this is usually an attempt to get the upper hand before betraying his \"savior\", which is seen on a few occasions to trick He-Man into dropping his guard before attacking and escaping.\n\nAs with all the Mike Young Productions series' characters, Skeletor's appearance is based on his figure from the Four Horsemen-designed toyline which the cartoon was produced to promote. Skeletor is the character that received perhaps the least-extensive redesign from his original toy/cartoon version. However, when this new design was then translated into animated form, MYP's artists usually gave him a voluminous cape; something which neither the new toy, nor the original incarnation of the character ever wore. The cape is typically adorned in situations where Skeletor chose to employ powerful magical feats. Skeletor is still commonly seen without his cape in the 2002 series while at rest or in combat situations not requiring extensive use of magic. When a later convention-exclusive figure of Keldor was made using the existing Skeletor body, a removable cloth cape was included. As the figure came with three swappable heads including his Keldor face; his burning, acid-splashed visage; and his final Skeletor head, this figure could thus be configured into a \"show-accurate\" caped Skeletor.\n\nAnother note is that his eyes appear, glowing red, in his sockets whenever he becomes enraged or demonstrates his magic powers. When Hiss was going to turn him to stone he claims his eyes are closed but Evil-Lyn proclaims he has no eyes.\n\nIn the comics published by DC Comics, Skeletor works to prevent Adam from remembering who he really is at all costs.\n\nSkeletor is disappointed that Beast Man failed yet discovered that Adam is not without skill. Their attempt to wipe his memory completely failed to erase his instinctive understanding of battle. Skeletor shows Beast Man mercy, but warns that his troublesome nephew must die...if he doesn't stay within the boundaries. When Skeletor sends words to his allies that Adam must be prevented from learning who he really is, the first to take action is Trap Jaw and his riders who ambush Adam in the desert.\n\nSkeletor mused at how he had previously worked so hard to capture Adam's sword thinking that it was the source of He-Man's power. Skeletor now knows that the sword is merely a conduit to the powers of Castle Grayskull. His dinner guest is a catatonic Sorceress of Castle Grayskull as he tries to get her to give him the knowledge of accessing the powers of Castle Grayskull. When Adam and Teela are on a ship at sea, Skeletor sends word to Mer-Man to dispose of \"Prince\" Adam.\n\nSkeletor is getting annoyed at the fact that none of his allies have successfully killed Adam. He can't leave Castle Grayskull to do the job himself or else he won't get back in. Even with all the torture he has caused the Sorceress of the castle, he worries that she is the key to unlocking the castle's power.\n\nEvil-Lyn reports the misplacement of her prisoners Adam and Teela to Skeletor. When she points out that the bird Zoar caused Adam to fall and discover the means of escape, Skeletor realizes that the Sorceress of Grayskull has been undermining him. Angrily, he bursts into her cell and demands to know where in his mind she was hiding. She reveals that she hid in plain sight within a pleasant memory...moments he rarely revisits. Grabbing her by the neck, he explains that he does not need her to get at Grayskull's power and snaps it dropping her limp body to the floor.\n\nAt Castle Grayskull, Skeletor has been informed by Beast Man that He-Man will be coming for him now that he has regained his memories, and wants to prepare Castle Grayskull for a siege. Skeletor tells Beast Man to do so if it brings him comfort. He then engages in a conversation with a head that has been advising him throughout the series, and eventually throws it through the window in a fit of rage. At Castle Grayskull, the preparations for the expected attack are complete. Skeletor, Beast Man. and Evil-Lyn overlook the battlefield in front of the castle, and await He-Man's arrival. Skeletor magically removes Evil-Lyn's mouth when she continues to speak even after he has ordered her to be silent.\n\nHe-Man tells Teela that he believes Skeletor is dead, then is seen calling himself a liar under his breath. Skeletor is revealed to have survived the fall into the chasm, but his skull is now cracked and broken, with his lower jaw appearing to be absent. Skeletor finds himself faced with the head that he threw out of the castle earlier, and it is revealed that this is some sort of minion that encourages Skeletor to not accept defeat. The final frames reveal that an unknown enemy that wishes Skeletor dead, but is not yet prepared to see it happen, has been manipulating Skeletor throughout the entire saga.\n\nSkeletor is planned to appear in the upcoming live-action \"Masters of the Universe\" adaptation. In the film, Keldor will be a human before becoming a skull-headed demon instead of Gar and be Adam's (and Adora's) older stepbrother instead of his uncle and Randor's older stepson instead of his half-brother, who is the chosen heir to the throne to become Skeletor.\n\nSkeletor possesses an array of mystic powers and is an extremely powerful sorcerer with control over a vast range of dark magical powers, such as the ability to teleport himself and others over vast distances, send telepathic commands to his minions, grow plants, hypnotism, illusions, reflection, freezing rays, and open gateways between dimensions. He also possesses considerable scientific skill, and is shown to have skill in creating various machines and devices in both the \"Filmation\" and \"New Adventures\" animated series. The 2002 series also shows him as a highly skilled swordsman, wielding dual swords and taking on multiple opponents.\n\nHe is usually armed with a magical weapon called the Havoc Staff, a long sceptre crowned with a ram's skull—sometimes depicted with an embedded crystal ball. He can discharge bolts of mystic force from the head of the Staff, or use it as a focus for more powerful forms of magic such as the theft of dreams. Skeletor has also displayed the ability to discharge energy from his own body, as is seen in the 1987 film where he casts lightning from his hands and in the original animated series where he projects energy from his fingertips. In the 2002 series, his innate powers seem much more limited; though his abilities, when in conjunction with his Havoc Staff seem nearly unmitigated in scope and highly potent in raw power.\n\nIn the early mini-comics, Skeletor sometimes possesses one half of the Power Sword. From this weapon he could also project magical energies. He also performed remote viewing via crystal ball. He has also shown himself to be a gifted swordsman. As a master of the occult arts, he is also privy to much secret knowledge about the universe.\n\nAll versions portray Skeletor as being extremely cunning and intelligent. He is also very strong, although his strength is no match for He-Man's. He has few weaknesses, aside from his inability to control his anger, and on occasion his overconfidence can also be his undoing.\n\nDespite his generally callous attitude towards his henchmen and others, Skeletor displays a certain degree of affinity towards animals. Skeletor's most constant animal companion is Panthor.\n\nPanthor is Skeletor's evil feline companion, a giant purple panther who serves as an evil counterpart to Battle Cat. Panthor is portrayed as Skeletor's pet or familiar spirit, being at the right of his throne. However, unlike He-Man's Battle Cat, Panthor only appears in a handful of stories in the original series. While his role is similarly limited in the 2002 series, he is more prominent in the episodes in which he appears compared to his appearances in the earlier series.\n\nIn \"\", Skeletor also shows some affinity towards Relay, a partly robotic dog who is a part of the Manchines. When shot down by Hordak late into the special, Skeletor is at first ready to leave Relay behind on a snowy mountain top, but decides to carry Relay with him when he can't bear to listen to his whimpering. Although Skeletor appears annoyed by Relay licking his face, he refuses to let Miguel or Alisha carry the creature.\n\nIn \"The New Adventures of He-Man\", Skeletor becomes friends with a small mutant creature named Grr. After intimidating Grr to submission, he pets it and decides he likes it because the creature is apparently as vicious as he.\n\n\n"}

His victims however, are not merely random humans as thought by the police. They are in fact, the past and present guardians of the gateway of the afterlife.\n\nOn the day he is to be married, Detective Kanzaki, who happens to be on the case, discovers that his fiancé Mina has been murdered with her heart also missing. He also learns that the killers are Kudo, a geneticist, and his evil secretary Rei. The two are trying to obtain six hearts from the guardians so that they may call forth a horde of demons from the Gate of Rage and have their every desire granted. Only problem is, once they open the gate the entire world will be covered in darkness.\n\nMeanwhile, in the afterlife, Mina encounters Izuko, the Guardian of the Gate. Izuko gives her three options: Mina can choose to ascend to heaven and be reborn, she can choose to forever walk the earth as a ghost or she can choose to curse one of the living to death and as a result be cursed to descend to hell. Mina has 12 days to make her choice.\n\nA big budget feature film prequel to a television series, \"Sky High\" is not an easy film to classify, as it comfortably fits into multiple genres. It is typically classified in the action or martial arts category, however it is very much a crime thriller about a cop (Kanzaki), whose fiancé (Mina) is only the latest victim in a series of macabre serial killings of young women. He uses his forensic skills as a detective to slowly uncover the identity of the killer—unknowingly aided by the ghost of Mina, who is desperately trying to figure out the identity of her own killer. The killer is revealed to be a woman (Rei) who is a fallen Guardian, risen from the dead; defeating her will require delving into fantasy and legend. \"Sky High\" is also a romance about love and loss as Mina faces a greater destiny ... becoming the new Guardian of the Gate and defending it against evil (the role her character plays in the television series).\n\nThe film opened in Japanese theaters in late 2003. Its premiere followed in the footsteps of the popular \"Sky High\" television series, starring the same actress (Yumiko Shaku) in the lead role of Izuko—or specifically, the \"new\" Izuko, as the film is considered a prequel to the TV series, revealing how Mina Saeki (Shaku) came to replace the previous Guardian and take her position as the Izuko we see in the series. Although the film makes much greater use of action, martial arts, and big budget special effects than the series is capable, both follow the same continuity. TV-Asahi, the Japanese television network behind the TV series is also the theatrical film's primary production company. The movie is helmed by popular action director Ryuhei Kitamura, best known for his \"Versus\" series of films, as well as other popular draws such as \"Azumi\" and \"\". Kitamura also directed several episodes of the TV series, and following the film's box office success, \"Sky High 2\" (or Season 2) was quickly put into production by the network for January 2004, utilizing many elements from the film, including its darker, edgier look, and improved sets and effects.\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by Isao Kiriyama, based on the manga \"Sky High\" by Tsutomu Takahashi.\n\nThe closing theme for the movie is \"Horizon\" by Hyde (L'Arc-en-Ciel and Vamps).\n"}

Tom Hanks also appears as the father of his real-life son's character. The character Buck Howard is inspired by the mentalist The Amazing Kreskin, whose popularity was at its height in the 1970s. The film premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2008. It is the first Walden Media film to be distributed by Magnolia Pictures.\n\nTroy Gable (Colin Hanks) defies his father (Tom Hanks) and leaves law school to pursue his dream of becoming a writer in Los Angeles. To support himself, he takes a job as a road manager for \"The Great\" Buck Howard (John Malkovich), a fading mentalist. Troy comes to enjoy traveling with Buck to performances in smaller venues such as Bakersfield and Akron. In particular, Troy sincerely admires Buck's signature trick: having someone in the audience hide his fee for that night's performance, which he then unfailingly discovers. (Kreskin is said to have actually performed this feat 6,000 times, only failing to find the money nine times.)\n\nA reluctant publicist, Valerie Brennan (Emily Blunt), is sent to join them in Cincinnati as a replacement for a more senior colleague to promote Buck's still secret attempt to resurrect his career. Valerie is disgusted by Buck's verbal abuse towards her and Troy, with whom she becomes romantically involved. Buck reveals that his comeback will involve putting \"hundreds\" of people (actually only a few dozen) to sleep and then awakening them as if from the dead. The trick works, but despite a large press turnout, no one is there to record the act, since the news media is called away at the last second to cover a car accident involving Jerry Springer. Furious, Buck unfairly blames the mishap on Troy and Valerie, and then faints from exhaustion. In the hospital, Buck and Troy discover that the media absence actually worked in Buck's favor, as rumors reported by the news media exaggerate the scope of Buck's act; as a result, Buck returns to the limelight as a retro-\"hip\" phenomenon. He appears on television shows such as those of Jon Stewart, Regis Philbin, Conan O'Brien, and more. Buck is reunited with his estranged friend, George Takei, who sings \"What the World Needs Now\".\n\nBuck finally gets the call he has been waiting for: To perform once again on \"The Tonight Show\". He previously had performed with Johnny Carson 61 times during the height of his career, but never since the show has been hosted by Jay Leno. Buck is bumped by Tom Arnold, who has too much material and uses up Buck's time. Buck refuses an immediate offer to come back and appear on \"The Tonight Show\" the following week, but agrees to receive an offer to headline a date in Las Vegas. When the limelight on Buck dims once more after he fails to find his money for the first time ever during his Las Vegas premiere, Troy leaves him and through Valerie's connections, lands a job with a celebrated TV writer (Griffin Dunne). After some time, Troy sees from an ad in the paper that Buck is doing his show again in Bakersfield. Buck is clearly back where he feels most comfortable, and once again successfully performs his signature trick, leaving Troy to wonder whether Buck doesn't have some mysterious talent after all.\n\n\n\"The Great Buck Howard\" received generally positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 72% of critics gave it positive reviews based on 88 reviews, the consensus being \"By turns fluffy and biting, this show biz comedy is given girth by comic heavyweight John Malkovich and made all the more charming by Emily Blunt.\" The film was released to the general public on March 20, 2009, grossing $115,004 in the opening weekend. It was run in 55 theaters, equaling to an average of $2,091 per theater. The worldwide gross stands at $900,689.\n\n"}

It is also recognized by the Art Deco Society of California for the restoring and remodeling process which took place beginning in 1999.\n\nThe building was constructed in the early 1920s. Around 1931 there was a fire that destroyed a good portion of the interior. The theater has been owned by Golden State Theaters, United California Theaters, and then United Artists. The building was originally a theater for live stage performances. At the time, it was known as The Strand Theater. After years of declining business, the theater became a second-run house, playing old Hollywood blockbusters at discounted rates, again, with little success. Finally the theater was shut down due to lack of business in the mid 1990s. The building remained untouched for years until an investment group headed by Hanz Mainz and Brenda Farley bought the property and started the renovation process.\n\nDuring renovations, the theater was renamed The Mainzer-Strand Theater, with the marquee reading \"The Mainzer.\" The interior of the building was changed by tearing out one of the movie cinemas and adding a large room with a balcony and a stage for all types of events. A small café was installed in the front lobby area. It was the hope of the investors to be able to hold large stage productions, concerts, comedy shows, private receptions, and show independent films in the two remaining cinemas.\n\nIn 1999, The Mainzer reopened to a large gala, a few comedy shows, and a few independent films. The attendance was again poor, but this time mainly due to inflated ticket prices for both concerts and films. In 2004, the Art Deco Society of California gave The Mainzer its \"Historic Preservation\" award for the recent renovations.\n\nIn 2006 the end was again looking near for The Mainzer. The investors were struggling to make the mortgage payments and bankruptcy loomed overhead. Finally, a deal was worked out that kept the doors open. A local Merced artist and musician, R.C. Essig, also known in the music world as Radioactive Cauliflower, leased the building from Brenda Farley. By this time, the theater had almost completely stopped showing movies except on rare occasions and has focused on only holding concerts with a mixture of local and national acts.\nIn the summer/fall of 2006, Essig fought to keep the place an independent, all-ages music venue, but it was a losing effort. The bank decided not to sell the property to Essig, but to another investment group. So after seven years of battling, the Mainzer Theater has finally shut its doors as an independent music venue. As of this time, it is unknown who purchased the building or what they are planning to do with it.\n\nBefore R.C. Essig took overall control of the theater, he worked for The Mainzer as their main booking agent. Essig was a recognized booking agent for his work on the Merced indie rock festival, The Gathering of Goodness. Due to this, Essig was able to book many of the same national acts at The Mainzer whenever they were touring California. The Mainzer has gained recognition as a good venue while in California.\n\nWhile many people considered The mainzer mainly an indie rock venue, it also held many shows in all genres of music from punk to metal to hip-hop.\n\n"}

Whereas \"Band of Brothers\" followed the men of Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment through the European Theater, \"The Pacific\" centers on the experiences of three Marines (Robert Leckie, Eugene Sledge, and John Basilone) who were all in different regiments (1st, 5th, and 7th, respectively) of the 1st Marine Division.\n\n\"The Pacific\" was spearheaded by Bruce C. McKenna (co-executive producer), one of the main writers on \"Band of Brothers.\" Hugh Ambrose, the son of \"Band of Brothers\" author Stephen Ambrose, served as a project consultant.\n\n\"The Pacific\" miniseries features the 1st Marine Division's battles in the Pacific, such as Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, and Okinawa, as well as Basilone's involvement in the Battle of Iwo Jima. It is based primarily on the memoirs of two U.S. Marines: \"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa\" by Eugene Sledge and \"Helmet for My Pillow\" by Robert Leckie. It also draws on Sledge's memoir \"China Marine\" and \"Red Blood, Black Sand,\" the memoir of Chuck Tatum, a Marine who fought alongside Basilone on Iwo Jima.\n\n\n\"The Pacific\" was produced by Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman in association with HBO Miniseries, Playtone, DreamWorks, Seven Network and Sky Movies. Seven and Sky both invested in the project for the right to broadcast it in Australia and the United Kingdom respectively. Nine Network has previously broadcast the HBO productions of \"Band of Brothers\". Nine had a broadcast deal with HBO's parent Warner Bros., but then HBO started to distribute its own productions separately. In April 2007, the producers set up a production office in Melbourne and began casting.\n\nOriginally the project was estimated at $100 million to produce, but ended up costing over $200 million, making \"The Pacific\" the most expensive television miniseries ever created by any network. According to \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" the series cost $270 million, with an estimated A$134 million of that spent in Australia. The Australian newspaper \"Herald Sun\" estimates that it brought 4,000 jobs and generated A$180 million for the Australian economy.\n\nFilming of the miniseries in Australia started on August 10, 2007, and finished in late May 2008. From August until November 2007 filming took place at locations in and around Port Douglas, Queensland including Mossman, Queensland; Drumsara Plantation, Mowbray National Park and beaches at Rocky Point, Queensland. Production then moved to rural Victoria, in the You Yangs near Lara (from November–December 2007), then at a sand quarry on Sandy Creek Road near Geelong, Victoria until February 2008. Melbourne city locations were used in late 2007 and through 2008 including Central City Studios at Melbourne Docklands (March 2008); Flinders Street (between Swanston and Elizabeth streets, 1–4 February 2008); the intersection of Swanston and Flinders streets (February 2008); Flinders Street Station (2–3 February 2008). Other suburban locations included Mornington Railway, Bundoora, Victoria, specifically the Ernest Jones Hall at the La Trobe University campus, Bundoora (late May 2008); the Railway Hotel, South Melbourne (December 2007); Scotch College, Melbourne (December 2007); Melbourne High School (December 2007).\n\nThe series' score was written by Hans Zimmer, Geoff Zanelli and Blake Neely and was released on March 9, 2010.\n\nHistorian Hugh Ambrose, son of \"Band of Brothers\" author Stephen E. Ambrose, wrote the official tie-in book to the miniseries, which follows the stories of two of the featured men from the miniseries, Basilone and Sledge, as well as stories of Sledge's close friend Sidney Phillips and two men not featured in the series, marine officer Austin Shofner and U.S. Navy pilot Vernon Micheel. The different cast provides a wider view of the Pacific theatre, allowing the book to include the fall of the Philippines, Midway, Philippine Sea and Luzon and expand the narrative to include depictions of life as experienced by prisoners of war, senior officers and the development of naval aviation. It was published in the UK and the U.S. in March 2010 and Ambrose gave a webcast interview about the book at the Pritzker Military Library on April 15, 2010.\n\nThe series premiered in the US and Canada on March 14, 2010, on HBO. HBO Asia premiered \"The Pacific\" at 9 pm on April 3, 2010, with the first two episodes being consecutively broadcast in the first week. Singapore, Hong Kong, and Indonesia had dual language available. Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Philippines broadcasts were available in high-definition on the HBO Asia HD Channel. \"The Pacific\" began broadcast on April 5, 2010 on Sky Movies in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In Portugal, the series was broadcast on April 5, 2010 on AXN and in HD on AXN HD two days after the original broadcast in the U.S. The series broadcast commenced in Australia on Channel 7 on Wednesday, April 14, 2010, at 8:30 pm. In Denmark, Norway, Finland, France and Sweden, the series began broadcasting on Canal+; in Turkey, CNBC-e on 18 April 2010; in the Netherlands, on April 7, 2010 on Veronica; and in Greece, on Nova Cinema on April 10, 2010.

In Japan, the miniseries started July 18, 2010 on WOWOW. In South Africa, the miniseries started broadcasting on May 5, 2010 on the Mnet channel.\n\nThe first official U.S. trailer for \"The Pacific\" aired on HBO prior to the season 2 premiere of \"True Blood\" on June 14, 2009. It showed footage of the three main characters, including a conversation between Leckie and Sledge, Basilone's marriage and numerous combat scenes. The trailer concluded with \"2010\" displayed on-screen -alluding to and confirming the series release date. A second trailer was released on the HBO website after which the date \"March 2010\" is displayed, giving a more specific series release date. On January 14, 2010, Comcast added on-demand content from the series, including a scene from \"The Pacific\", interviews with the producers and character profiles. Another trailer was shown in February 2010 during Super Bowl XLIV, depicting several combat scenes. An extended trailer (3:47) to the miniseries can be viewed on the series' official website.\n\n\"The Pacific\" was very well received by critics, receiving an average score of 87 out of 100 at review aggregator Metacritic. \"Time\" magazine's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 TV Series of 2010. IGN reviewer Ramsey Isler gave the entire miniseries an 8.5 out of 10 'Great' score, saying \"Although I don't think \"The Pacific\" overtakes \"Band of Brothers\" in terms of technical execution and overall entertainment value, many of the comparisons will be moot as \"The Pacific\" is a different kind of series with different goals. This series sought to look beyond the combat and it paints a full, vivid picture of the war and the people that fought it through focused, individual stories. That's a tall order for any series to fulfill, and although The Pacific doesn't always come through with shining colors, it does make an admirable effort.\" IGN also reviewed each individual episode, with Episode 9 receiving a perfect 10 out of 10 score.\n\n\"The Pacific\" won a Peabody Award in 2010 for \"this series reminding us of the necessities—and the costs—of service.\"\n\n\n"}

Based in the United States, the WXC has eight weight divisions and enforces the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. Norbert Pasztor serves as the president of the WXC.\n\nInspired by UFC, the first WXC event was held in 2008 in Monroe, Michigan. Showcasing fighters of different disciplines — including Boxing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Tae Kwon Do, Wrestling, Muay Thai, Karate and other styles — the WXC sought to provide authentic and most effective martial art in a real fight.\n\nThe current rules for the Warrior Xtreme Cagefighting are the rules established by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board. The \"Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard \"de facto\" set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\nWXC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes. Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card), will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Bouts which re either on the preliminary card, or on the main card prior to the main event, last for a maximum of three rounds. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\nThe WXC currently uses eight weight classes:\n\nThe WXC stages bouts in a six-sided enclosure officially named \"The Hexagon\".\n\nThe WXC cage is a hexagon structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl and a diameter of , allowing of space from side to side. The fence is to high. The cage sits atop a platform, raising it from the ground. It has foam padding around the top of the fence and between each of the six sections. It also has two entry-exit gates opposite each other. The mat, painted with sponsorship logos and art, is replaced for each event.\n\nAll competitors must fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Shirts, gis or long pants (including gi pants) are not allowed. Fighters must use approved light-weight open-fingered gloves, that include at least 1\" of padding around the knuckles, (110 to 170 g / 4 to 6 ounces) that allow fingers to grab. These gloves enable fighters to punch with less risk of an injured or broken hand, while retaining the ability to grab and grapple. A mouthguard and jockstrap with protective cup are also required and is checked by a State Athletic Committee official before being allowed to enter the cage/ring.\n\n\nNote: In the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total \"points\" be equal. However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of \"win judgments\" from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively).\n\nA fight can also end in a technical decision, technical submission, disqualification, forfeit, technical draw, or no contest. The latter two outcomes have no winners.\n\nThe ten-point must system is in effect for all WXC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points, the loser nine points or fewer. Scores of 10–8 are typically awarded for very dominant rounds.\n\n\nWhen a foul is charged, the referee in their discretion may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.\n\n\nA WXC fighter generally does not have a salary, Amateur fighters do not get paid. Professional fighters are paid per fight, with amounts depending on how well-known the fighters are and how well sponsored a fighter and an event is. Fighters will typically get paid money to fight with an additional bonus if they win. Cash bonuses are also typically awarded for \"Fight of the Night\", \"Knockout of the Night\", and \"Submission of the Night.\" The size of these bonuses varies by event, but, for less well-known fighters, they can be several times larger than the contracted amount for the fight.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21568774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21568774", "title": "Worldcolor", "text": "Worldcolor\n\nWorld Color Press Inc. (\"Worldcolor\") (formerly Quebecor World) was a company which provided high-value and comprehensive print, digital, and related services to businesses worldwide. World Color and its subsidiaries printed various commercial products, including comic books, magazines, brochures, direct mail and newspaper inserts, and directories, while also providing clients a broad range of pre-press services, such as desktop production and assembly. \n\nWorld Color was the first printer to make comic book printing a major part of its business plan, and throughout most of its history was the dominant North American printer of comics and associated publications. During its history, World Color was also at the forefront of many new technologies and printing innovations, including use of web offset presses, \"pool shipping,\" rotogravure printing, computer technology, digital registration systems, and flexography.\n\nWorld Color merged with Quebecor Printing in 1999; at the time World Color was the largest printer of consumer magazines in the United States and the third largest commercial printer in North America. Worldcolor was acquired by Quad/Graphics in early 2010.\n\nWorld Color Press was founded in 1903 by the owners of the \"St. Louis Star\" under the name World's Fair Color Printing. The wholly owned subsidiary was created to handle color printing for the upcoming 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and was expected to disband at the World Fair's conclusion. Instead, the company name was shortened to World Color Printing and continued as a commercial printer, focusing on a new business: the color \"funnies\" section of the Sunday newspaper.\n\nWorld Color's first foray into comics was syndicating George Herriman's \"Major Ozone's Fresh Air Crusade\" from January 2, 1904, to November 19, 1906. During this period, World Color also distributed the Herriman strips \"Grandma's Girl—Likewise Bud Smith\", which he combined from two earlier strips, and a two-tiered children's strip, \"Rosy Posy—Mama's Girl\". \n\nRobert Grable and Roswell Messing, Sr., two \"St. Louis Star\" senior employees, purchased the company in 1922. As the popularity of the Sunday color comic section increased, the funnies quickly evolved into an American institution, and metropolitan papers increasingly began featuring comic supplements. As the first major printer of color sections, World Color Press was often the first choice for printing these sections, and by the early 1930s, the company had printing contracts with newspapers nationwide.\n\nIn the early 1930s, realizing the sales potential of the comics medium, company management attempted to maximize profits by reprinting the funnies in magazine format, thereby creating one of the first prototypes of the comic book. While the initial comic books were simply collections of previously published editions of the Sunday comic strips, by 1936 they contained original material.\n\nWorld Color made the most of the idea and quickly emerged as the leading printer in this new field. To keep up with ever-increasing demand, the company began construction of a satellite printing plant in Sparta, Illinois. Opened in 1948, the Sparta plant was the most technologically advanced plant in the industry devoted solely to the printing of comic magazines. \n\nWithin five years World Color Press became the largest producer of comic magazines in the industry. Comic book sales boomed during World War II and the postwar period, and throughout this period, World Color was the nation's leading comic book printer. (Comics were the most popular form of newsstand magazine.) \n\nIn 1956, the company installed one of the first web-offset presses in its Sparta plant. This innovative printing process, in which rolls or \"webs\" of paper are fed through rubber-blanketed cylinders, producing tens of thousands of impressions an hour, helped lead the industry into the modern era of print technology. By the early 1970s, World Color purchased more equipment and expanded their plants, becoming the largest player in the comic and newsstand special-interest publication market.\n\nBy the early 1980s World Color Press printed most American comic books, including those of the industry giants Marvel and DC.\nWorld Color's dominance in the field led to a 1984 lawsuit by Illinois-based First Comics, accusing them of anti-competitive practices. The suit was resolved in the spring of 1988. In 1985, DC Comics named World Color Press as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication \"Fifty Who Made DC Great\".\n\nThe development of the web-press in the 1950s enabled World Color to further diversify into the relatively new product lines of web-printed newsstand and special interest magazines. Equally important to the company's growth during the 1950s was its development of the \"pool shipping\" concept, a distribution method in which publications from different customers going to the same destination were shipped together, reducing freight costs and increasing the timeliness of deliveries. By establishing the first major pool shipping network to newsstands, the company was able to expand its customer base by offering the lowest distribution costs in the industry.\n\nWorld Color computerized many aspects of its business in the 1960s, providing the company with more efficient production and distribution capabilities, as well as the ability to perform more complicated printing procedures and reproduce more complex data. In 1969, World Color started construction of a web-offset facility in Effingham, Illinois, approximately 120 miles northeast of Sparta. The new plant was designed to produce magazines printed on coated paper with extensive use of four-color printing. Success in this arena led to a 1971 expansion of the Effingham plant that nearly doubled its original size. The 1971 addition increased the company's ability to produce large-circulation monthly magazines printed on letter-press equipment.\n\nResponding to a need to increase the company's flexibility in scheduling presses, in 1970, the company standardized the make and type of its presses. This change was expected to result in paper savings, more consistent quality, and schedule flexibility. Though it was a short-term risk, the strategy paid off with its clients, enabling the company to become a stronger competitor in the four-color, high-quality magazine market.\n\nIn 1975, the company expanded its gravure division by constructing a plant between Effingham and Sparta. Further expansions in client-base led to the 1980 construction of another new plant in Des Plaines, Illinois. By the beginning of the 1980s, the company had emerged as the leader in the printing and distribution of consumer publications, with sales of more than $371 million. During the 1980s, World Color added seven state-of-the-art printing facilities, strategically located throughout the United States, strengthening the company's reputation for providing low distribution costs. In 1985, World Color Press was listed as the fourth largest printer in North America, with sales totaling $544 million.\n\nBy 1993, World Color's core business was magazine printing; contracts with hundreds of leading periodicals, including \"U.S. News & World Report\", \"Cosmopolitan\", \"Rolling Stone\", and \"Forbes\", accounted for approximately half of the company's 1993 revenues. (The company came to the aid of competitor R.R. Donnelley & Sons in January 1995, printing 300,000 issues of \"People\" magazine for Donnelley after flood waters forced the closing of a Donnelley plant near Los Angeles.) During this period, World Color expanded its operations into a number of specialty services: catalog printing contracts generated more than a fifth of total revenues in 1993, and represented the company's fastest growing division.\n\nWorld Color's early dominance in the comics market led the company to diversify, their first move being the 1928 purchase of another St. Louis-based printer, Commercial Color Press, which specialized in printing weekly newspapers and circulars. This diversification helped the company survive the lean years of the Great Depression. \n\nIn 1968, World Color was purchased by New York-based City Investing, prompting World Color to move its headquarters from St. Louis to New York.\n\nIn 1974, as World Color shifted focus to the high-end magazine market, the company purchased Louisville, Kentucky-based Fawcett Printing. This acquisition enabled World Color Press to add the rotogravure printing process to its repertoire.\n\nIn 1984, the investment giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. bought World Color from City Investing, providing the company with continued financial backing. In 1989, World Color acquired Chicago's Bradley Printing, and in December 1991, they acquired California's third-largest printer, George Rice & Sons. In January 1993, they purchased catalog/direct mail printer Alden Press. With these acquisitions, in just a few years World Color became a major player in the catalog and commercial publishing arenas.\n\nWorld Color pursued major expansions in 1996 and 1997, purchasing Ringier America and Rand McNally's Book Services Group, thereby becoming second in size only to RR Donnelley. In 1999, the company merged with Quebecor Printing in a U.S. $2.7 billion deal to create Quebecor World (USA) Inc., moving its headquarters to Montreal.
